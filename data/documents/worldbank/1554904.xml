ABSTRACT&#13;
Management problems in the implementation of rural development are&#13;
analyzed from a bureaucratic political standpoint. Proposals for management&#13;
improvement will fail if they do not take account of informal interests and&#13;
the patterns of incentives and pressures these create. At present, these&#13;
informal incentives often make it irrational for managers and field staff to&#13;
implement poverty-oriented programs as planned. Tentative methods are put&#13;
forward for assessing incentives in rural development bureaucrac:Les, and&#13;
various means of influencing the 'incentive environment' are expLored, with&#13;
the aim of making it make sense for bureaucrats to be more responsive to the&#13;
needs of poor beneficiaries.&#13;

PREFACE&#13;
Through the 1970s, the planning of rural development was emphasized&#13;
rather than the management of implementation. But a key characteristic of&#13;
the implementation process in the developing world is its political nature:&#13;
and political influences on the development bureaucracy effectively alter&#13;
policy and plans at the implementation stage. Some of these influences come&#13;
from above, from the official political level of government: others from&#13;
below, from powerful groups in the rural areas: others again are generated by&#13;
interest groups within the bureaucracy itself. They result in performance in&#13;
the field which differs radically from the intentions of project designers&#13;
and funding agencies, and which cannot be explained solely by the endemic&#13;
resource and skilled manpower shortages of the Third World. These political&#13;
pressures, explicit or informal, affect the attitudes and day-to-day actions&#13;
of project and program managers, through the creation of a pattern of incen-&#13;
tives and pressures within implementing agencies. This question of politics&#13;
and incentives, and their effects on implementation, is the concern of this&#13;
paper.&#13;
The broad aim is to examine the bureaucratic-political determinants&#13;
of implementation failure and success, with particular reference to&#13;
poverty-oriented development in rural areas of the Third World. Within this&#13;
broad aim, there are several specific goals:&#13;
(a) To make the case that the organization and management&#13;
aspects of development have been neglected in general.&#13;
(b)  To argue in particular that the bureaucratic-political&#13;
envi-ronment of development managers has been ignored,&#13;
and hence the pattern of incentives and pressures&#13;
affecting them misunderstood.&#13;
(c) To put forward a method of assessing the incentives&#13;
and pressures in implementing organizations, so that&#13;
these may be taken systematically into account during&#13;
Project preparation.&#13;
(d) To outline systematic measures through which funding&#13;
agencies may influence incentives in implementing&#13;
organizations, and hence indirectly constrain&#13;
bureaucratic-political activity which is not in the&#13;
interests of development goals.&#13;
(e) To stress the importance of adopting such measures,&#13;
in the context of widespread implementation failure&#13;
to date, and a Third World political environment&#13;
unsupportive of poverty-oriented development.&#13;
The immediate audience of this paper is the funding agency, foreign or domes-&#13;
tic: the concern is therefore with the external control of implementing&#13;
organizations. The need is for practically oriented analysis and prescrip-&#13;
tion, so that, while frequent reference is made to recent literature in the&#13;
field, the intent has been to avoid the jargon of organization theory. The&#13;
paper focuses throughout on the implementation question, on the assumption&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-ii-&#13;
that the program or project plan is given, and is appropriate and feasible.&#13;
This major assumption therefore consciously excludes the wide range of&#13;
implementation failure caused by project designs that are insufficiently&#13;
appropriate to the needs of the rural poor in the first place, or whose&#13;
administrative requirements are inherently "unmanageable."&#13;
Use of Terms&#13;
Management is used broadly to cover the entire "organization of&#13;
implementation." Management is specifically not seen as solely or mainly the&#13;
activity of senior managers; emphasis is placed on the important management&#13;
role of middle and junior level staff, especially field staff, whom the&#13;
literature on bureaucracy has tended to ignore. Motivation and Incentives:&#13;
Psychologists concerned with organizations (e.g., Abraham Maslow) have used&#13;
the term motivation in the limited sense of intrinsic motivation. The term&#13;
is used here in the wider layman's sense, and the concern is in fact much&#13;
more with extrinsic motivation (see pages 39 and 40). Incentives are com-&#13;
monly equated with financial incentives only, especially in the business&#13;
management literature; this is specifically not the emphasis here. Given the&#13;
limited scope for altering financial rewards in bureaucracy, a major aim of&#13;
this paper is to explore the use of non-financial incentives to influence&#13;
management action. Appraisal and Evaluation: The convention is followed&#13;
that ex-ante evaluation is referred to as appraisal. However, the term&#13;
evaluation is not here limited to ex-post (summative) evaluation, but&#13;
includes continuing (formative) evaluation during the implementation process,&#13;
an aspect of evaluation which the conventional ex-post, ex-ante distinction&#13;
misses.&#13;

SUMMARY&#13;
Neglect of the Management Factor&#13;
Poor public sector management is recognized as a key constraint on&#13;
poverty-oriented rural development. But it is an elusive and neglected&#13;
constraint because:&#13;
(a)  It is hard to separate the results of poor management&#13;
from the many problems in poor countries which are beyond&#13;
managers  control.&#13;
(b)  Management research has concentrated on the upper levels of&#13;
bureaucracies, rather than the middle and junior officials&#13;
who actually implement projects in the field. It thus does&#13;
not meet the practical needs of managers or advisers.&#13;
(c)  Habits of thougjht and appraisal techniques have not charnged&#13;
to meet the needs of the 1970s generation of managemerLt-&#13;
intensive rura:L development projects.&#13;
(d)  Professional bias encourages the wrong diagnosis of across-&#13;
the-board organization and management problems as special-&#13;
ized, technical, sectoral problems.&#13;
(e)  Funding agencies have little access to key management pro-&#13;
cesses in implementing organizations, and hence to the causes&#13;
rather than the symptoms of poor management.&#13;
(f)  The access problem is compounded by the political sensitiv-&#13;
ity of management issues, especially the controversial&#13;
question of who has control of scarce resources for what&#13;
ends.&#13;
Why Emphasize Incentives and Politics?&#13;
Two major approaches to management improvement have been through&#13;
the structural reform of organizations, and management training. However,&#13;
structural reform is often short-circuited by the workings of the informal&#13;
management system, and then results in no more than symbolic action. Manage-&#13;
ment training is often not adapted to the environment of third world&#13;
bureaucracies. An incentives approach to management complements existing&#13;
structural and training approaches. It is also more fundamental, in that&#13;
the pattern of incentives and motives within the bureaucracy ultimately&#13;
determines whether new structures and newly trained managers will be used to&#13;
their intended effect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-iv-&#13;
Four models of organizational processes are examined: rational,&#13;
bureaucratic, garbage can and political. It is suggested that current&#13;
management approaches imply that implementing agencies work primarily accord-&#13;
ing to a mixture of bureaucratic and garbage can processes, to which a&#13;
rationalist response would make sense. In reality, the political model is&#13;
often more appropriate. The apparently unplanned, haphazard outcomes of much&#13;
bureaucratic activity in fact suit important political interest groups, and&#13;
are hence not as random as they seem. Rationalist solutions will therefore&#13;
fail if they do not take account of political processes with their own&#13;
rationality, and the incentive systems these imply.&#13;
Bureaucracy as Politics&#13;
The official goals of poverty-oriented development are&#13;
multi-purpose and qualitative. Lack of goal clarity and difficulties in&#13;
measuring achievement allow the pursuit of informal political goals within&#13;
development bureaucracies. Informal personalist management systems also&#13;
imply'a looser structure and hence greater scope for playing politics in the&#13;
implementation process. But the prevalence of politics and conflict, per-&#13;
sonalism and patronage are insufficient to explain why even winners in the&#13;
struggle for resources and power are often consistently bad performers in the&#13;
field. Seen from within, the bureaucratic picture is of interest groups in&#13;
conflict. Seen from below--the viewpoint of the poor--it is one of&#13;
coalition: a coalition of indifference to their needs. Conflict occurs&#13;
primarily over the allocation of resources: but there is little perceived&#13;
political advantage in using resources to maximum developmental effect once&#13;
secured. The poor do not have the political voice to disturb this coalition.&#13;
As a result, resources enter the bureaucratic system, but do not "trickle&#13;
down" to the intended beneficiaries.&#13;
Perpetuation of many of the "problems" of bureaucracy--centralism,&#13;
departmentalism, duplication, and sometimes red tape in decision-making--is&#13;
often in the interest of the key political game-players adept at handling the&#13;
system. "Rationalist" administrative innovation tends to destroy the infor-&#13;
mal management systems fundamental to the existing balance of power, and will&#13;
therefore be resisted. The implications for an incentives approach to&#13;
management are extremely significant. New programs and projects must take&#13;
account of bureaucratic politics, and provide an incentive, in terms of a&#13;
perceived personal advantage, for bureaucrats at each level and in every&#13;
department involved. This implies the addition of a new dimension to project&#13;
design: the assessment of motivation and incentives within implementing&#13;
agencies, and systematic attention to the kind of incentive patterns which&#13;
will make indifference to poor beneficiaries no longer the politically&#13;
rational attitude.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Assessing Incentives&#13;
The key assumption in assessing incentives is that bureaucrats&#13;
(like peasants) are rational. It is often not that ignorance and apathy are&#13;
the determinants of behavior, but that existing incentive systems make it in&#13;
officials' rational self-interest to be apathetic in pursuit of development&#13;
goals.  The first step in assessing incentives is to break organizations down&#13;
into a small number of key interest groups and individuals whose strategic&#13;
placing gives them control over project performance. Assessment: should&#13;
concentrate on these "incentive-setters", who may not be in positions of&#13;
formal power, but who will tend to determine the behavior of "incen-&#13;
tive-followers" elsewhere in the organization. Incentives and pressures can&#13;
then be divided for analysis into four main categories: internal priorities&#13;
(or general attitude to career); official pressures from superiors (the&#13;
party/official line); informal pressures from superiors (reflect:ing informal&#13;
political priorities); local pressures (inherent in the daily workload).&#13;
There are therefore three major motivating factors other than the dictates of&#13;
the official project line. An incentives approach is concerned to assess&#13;
each of these factors, and to create a situation where there is a minimum of&#13;
conflict between personal, formal and informal goals, i.e., one where it is&#13;
in managers' and field staff's rational self-interest to pursue official&#13;
project goals.&#13;
Formal attention to incentives should be given at the reconnais-&#13;
sance, feasibility and implementation stages of projects, with the most&#13;
detailed assessment made at the feasibility stage. This should trace through&#13;
the network of activities involved in implementation, stop at each critical&#13;
action or assumption (e.g., about coordination), and assess whether the&#13;
incentives exist for the officials to act as planned. There are two main&#13;
practical problems in following the conceptual approach developed for assess-&#13;
ment: gaining access to informal management processes, and the danger of&#13;
subjective bias in the evaluator. Interviews aimed at uncovering informal&#13;
priorities must be complemented by comparing officials' professed priorities&#13;
with actual results in the field, which, if the ration'al bureaucrat approach&#13;
is correct, will reflect real priorities, formal or informal. Inferences&#13;
about motivation drawn from objective achievement or non-achievement help to&#13;
reduce the problem of subjectivity.&#13;
Influencing Incentives&#13;
There are two main "depoliticized" approaches to influencing incen-&#13;
tives: through planning and through feedback mechanisms, seen Ln the context&#13;
of management as an iterative control/feedback process. Legitimate influence&#13;
in the planning area includes:&#13;
a)   Clarifying and prioritizing multiple and often conflicting&#13;
goals, at program, project and individual job description&#13;
levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-vi-&#13;
b)   Setting goals that are realistic in terms of resource&#13;
availability and constraints at each level: setting&#13;
such goals with the participation of implementing officials.&#13;
c)   Planning institutionalized planning into project designs,&#13;
in the form of Planning Units with terms of reference that&#13;
maximize their incentives effects and minimize the likelihood&#13;
of political conflict with other departments.&#13;
d)   Cooperatively designing coordination mechanisms at the project&#13;
preparation stage with other agencies involved.&#13;
e)   Special emphasis on planning to reach the poor.&#13;
f)   On-going planning during implementation, e.g., critical&#13;
path analysis.&#13;
Legitimate areas for influencing feedback include:&#13;
a)   Emphasis on formative rather than summative evaluation.&#13;
b)   Moves to "participative monitoring", based on self-&#13;
evaluation by field officers, with the participation&#13;
of beneficiaries, peers and superiors. This makes&#13;
the purpose of monitoring and evaluation at least as&#13;
much the refinement of plans as the supervision of&#13;
subordinates.&#13;
c)   Institutionalizing feedback mechanisms in Planning,&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation Units, which provide&#13;
consultancy services to departments and complement&#13;
participative monitoring with sample reports of progress.&#13;
d)   The choice of smaller numbers of indicators which more&#13;
directly reflect key goals and hence performance.&#13;
At the general bureaucratic-political level, such "apolitical"&#13;
planning and feedback measures effectively stress official goals at all&#13;
levels in the hierarchy: make deviations from these goals more apparent:&#13;
reduce the areas of vagueness necessary to the pursuit of informal goals:&#13;
and reduce system overload, which can act as a smokescreen behind which&#13;
informal priorities may be emphasized. But in cases where official and&#13;
informal goals diverge considerably, officials may well see such techniques&#13;
as a political threat to current practices, and react by rejecting, divert-&#13;
ing, partially implementing or turning them into symbolic rather than effec-&#13;
tive action. Where incentives assessments suggest this probability, funding&#13;
agencies must face the necessity of themselves becoming an effective interest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-vi i-&#13;
group in the political game, using both positive and negative methods.&#13;
Encouragement involves reinforcing political commitment by consistently&#13;
reiterating funding agency commitment to key goals, and by forging and main-&#13;
taining alliances with key incentive-setters in pursuit of them. Pressure&#13;
can be exerted by the pha,sing of implementation activity, and making succes-&#13;
sive budget tranches conditional on performance.&#13;

CHAPTER ONE&#13;
NE(:LECT OF THE MANAGEMENT FACTOR&#13;
Management: An Important: But Elusive Constraint&#13;
Recent World Bank publications clearly highlight the importance of&#13;
the management factor in rural development. Both the 1980 and 1981 Reviews&#13;
of Project Performance Audit Reports, which for the first time examined&#13;
samples of "new-style" rural projects, found that management and. institu-&#13;
tional problems, together with disincentive producer prices, were most&#13;
closely linked with poor implementation performance. The 1981 Sub-Sahara&#13;
Report brought out the crucial importance of more efficient management of the&#13;
parastatals concerned with rural development. Most significantly of all,&#13;
the 1983 World Development Report is to be devoted to the topic "Managing&#13;
Development." On the borrower side, "absorbtive capacity" const:raints speak&#13;
for themselves. In Thailand, for example, the ratio of actual expenditure to&#13;
appropriations for donor-financed projects executed by government agencies&#13;
has seldom exceeded 50 percent in recent years. Limited administrative&#13;
capacity must be a major explanation for this in a country which is concerned&#13;
to prevent the penetration of communist ideology in the rural areas, and&#13;
hence has a relatively high interest in promoting rural development. Sig-&#13;
nificant though such figures for development expenditure are, they represent&#13;
no more than the tip of the iceberg, since so much of the money that is&#13;
actually spent on rural development is not spent effectively. Expenditure&#13;
figures in every country conceal numerous uncompleted projects: numerous&#13;
"integrated" projects where the planned balance of sectoral development has&#13;
not been met; and the vast majority of projects which achieve benefits, only&#13;
substantially less and later than planned. (In the northeast of Thailand,&#13;
for example, 1979 estimates show that of a potential 384,000 acres that could&#13;
be irrigated from existing dams in the dry season only just over 21,000 acres&#13;
were actually being cropped.) The vast majority of poor implementation in&#13;
the second and third categories is never even discovered owing to the minimal&#13;
resources devoted to ex-post evaluation. And what is perhaps most serious is&#13;
the fact that the greatest implementation weaknesses seem to be in programs&#13;
with the most direct impact on the poorest segments of the population, and in&#13;
more remote and poorer regions.&#13;
The importance of the management factor may be clear enough at the&#13;
aggregate level, but can become harder to isolate specifically at the&#13;
individual project level. The first problem is that of separating the&#13;
results of poor management from the many problems in poor countries which are&#13;
beyond managers' control. The best of project-level planning systems may&#13;
be unable to predict, say, increased pesticide needs due to an unexpected&#13;
infestation, and poor countries cannot afford to keep stocks in hand to cover&#13;
every contingency. Shortfalls of fertilizer at the project level may reflect&#13;
foreign exchange shortages rather than management weaknesses, so that even in&#13;
an apparently clearcut case of non-arrival of agricultural inputs, the share&#13;
of responsibility attributable to poor management may be hard to decide. A&#13;
still more fundamental problem in estimating the importance of the management&#13;
constraint lies in the assumptions implicit in evaluators' criteria of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
success--which are basically whether results in the field are those required&#13;
by the project plan. Deviations from these requirements tend automatically&#13;
to be put down to inadequacies of implementation. For the purposes of most&#13;
of this paper, which is not concerned primarily with the major planning&#13;
exercise before implementation, these assumptions are accepted for con-&#13;
venience. However, in practice, the plan may be inappropriate in the first&#13;
place. For example, in the current fashion for integrated rural development,&#13;
major projects may be designed with emphasis on aspects of social infrastruc-&#13;
ture and community development which involve heavy administrative input for&#13;
highly intangible results. Project management may feel that these somewhat&#13;
"ideal" projects go beyond what is required or expected by farmers. Under&#13;
these conditions, deviations from the project plan during implementation may&#13;
make very good sense, but still be labelled symptoms of poor management&#13;
according to standard evaluation criteria.&#13;
The management constraint is therefore an important but elusive&#13;
one. Apparently poor management can sometimes in fact be an example of&#13;
flexible adaptation by project administrators to contingencies not foreseen&#13;
at the time of appraisal--the working of Albert Hirschman's benevolent&#13;
"Hiding Hand" (Hirschman, 1967). More often, the symptoms of poor management&#13;
are attributed to other causes, and the elusiveness of the management factor&#13;
encourages its neglect.&#13;
Limitations of Management Theory&#13;
A second cause of neglect is to be found in the current limitations&#13;
of management theory. The practitioner has limited time to keep himself up&#13;
to date with advances in theory. His criteria for what is a successful&#13;
approach are what is relevant and useful, and what is simple enough for him&#13;
to apply and to explain to officials whose training has often either been&#13;
narrowly technical or superficially generalist. From this standpoint, a good&#13;
deal of academic literature is abstruse and overloaded with jargon. In&#13;
addition, the development administration literature has concentrated largely&#13;
on areas which do not meet the practical needs of evaluator or advisor. The&#13;
concern is often with analyzing the bureaucracy as a whole, and in developing&#13;
theories which explain its structure and behavior at a general level. The&#13;
limited empirical research carried out within third world bureaucracies has&#13;
concentrated on the higher strata of the Civil Service. Rather little work&#13;
has been done with the middle and junior level officials who actually carry&#13;
out the implementation of rural development projects. The way in which this&#13;
bias in the literature was reflected for many years in the emphasis of prac-&#13;
tical advisory work is summarized by Esman and Montgomery (1979, 46):&#13;
The improvement of central administrative systems was the&#13;
major concern of public administration in the 1950s and&#13;
1960s. The main emphasis was on common administrative&#13;
support systems--personnel, budget and accounting, supply,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
organization and methods, and central coordinative proce-&#13;
dures   .  . Management techniques such as position classi-&#13;
fication, perfoirmance budgeting and central procurement&#13;
were "installed" into the higher reaches of government,&#13;
along with institutes of public administration and ecoles&#13;
nationales d'administration. In many cases these techniques&#13;
and institutions proved unsuited to their new environrnent:&#13;
the forms survived but had little practical effect on the&#13;
workings of government ....... Administrative reformers did&#13;
not appreciate the degree of behavioral change at all levels&#13;
of the bureaucracy that was necessary if these radica:L inno-&#13;
vations were to influence performance. The result was that&#13;
these efforts at reform by changing government-wide systems&#13;
had little visible impact in the field.&#13;
The explanation for these practical limitations is perhaps that&#13;
development administration (in the sense of a body of theory and practice&#13;
adapted to the specific conditions of developing countries) is a much less&#13;
established discipline than its place in university curricula mLght suggest.&#13;
For the moment, theory provides few readily available and practically useful&#13;
tools for the practitioner, and none that are universally accept:ed. The lack&#13;
of ready theoretical approaches to management problems is necessarily a cause&#13;
as well as an effect of their neglect.&#13;
Habits of Thought&#13;
A third reason for neglect is that present techniques and habits&#13;
of thought were developed largely for a previous generation of much less&#13;
"management-intensive" projects and programs.   The new-style rural develop-&#13;
ment project of the 1970s raised the management problem in its most acute&#13;
form, with the need for centralized bureaucracies to organize change in areas&#13;
remote from the capital and poorly served with physical and administrative&#13;
infrastructure: and within those areas to reach a large, geographically&#13;
diffuse and ill-educated population. The emphasis on "integrated" develop-&#13;
ment put further stress on management, calling as it did for unprecedented&#13;
coordination and cooperation between goverment departments. Project&#13;
appraisal and evaluation techniques lag behind the requirements of a changing&#13;
philosophy of development. The evolution of cost-benefit analysis is an&#13;
example. The main efforts to improve cost-benefit techniques have con-&#13;
centrated on the quantitative pricing of costs and benefits (e.g., shadow&#13;
pricing and weighting systems), rather than on improving the qualitative&#13;
assessment of realistic implementation speeds. This is despite the fact that&#13;
these are not only of crucial social and political importance, but directly&#13;
affect the economic IRR which has been of so much concern to the analysts&#13;
themselves.&#13;
The preoccupation with allocative efficiency at the expense of&#13;
organizational efficiency and effectiveness was highlighted by Harvey&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
Leibenstein of Harvard University in a now classic article as long ago as&#13;
1966 (Leibenstein, 1966). One reason for relative neglect of the efficiency&#13;
factor is that closer involvement with management questions, and hence with&#13;
the control of recipient organizations, raises a host of political difficul-&#13;
ties. Corrections for allocative efficiency, on the other hand, are&#13;
camouflaged by shadow pricing's mystique of figures, and so have been able&#13;
more quietly to facilitate adoption of the equity-oriented projects of the&#13;
1970s. But the major reason for concentration on one kind of efficiency only&#13;
is the professional bias of economists. The emphasis on quantitative train-&#13;
ing predisposes economists to refine shadow pricing techniques (even when the&#13;
poor quality of the data available makes such refinement often questionable)&#13;
because this is what they are good at. Economists are also trained to see&#13;
projects in input/output terms, so that the essence of the cost-benefit&#13;
procedure is an exercise in comparative statics--a comparison of the&#13;
with-project scenario against the without- project scenario. In the&#13;
cost-benefit calculation, it is as if a series of photographs is taken of the&#13;
project at successive year-ends, with cash-flows artificially accumulated&#13;
to these points for discounting.. In contrast to this static approach,&#13;
cost-benefit analysis should be seen as involving the construction of an&#13;
"implementation model" of the project, stressing dynamics and process as much&#13;
as statics and quantity. In practice, appraisal and evaluation guidelines&#13;
used by donors (and hence also by many consultants and borrowers) continue to&#13;
reflect the influence of well-known economists in the cost-benefit field,&#13;
e.g., Squire and van der Tak (IBRD), Little and Mirlees (UK ODA), and so&#13;
perpetuate this professional bias. The Little and Mirlees manual, for&#13;
example, is called, all-embracingly, "Project Appraisal and Planning for&#13;
Developing Countries," and contains a chapter on "Scarce Resources" which&#13;
does not consider management skills as a scarce resource. In 1977, ODM&#13;
produced a revised version (UK Ministry of Overseas Development, 1977) of its&#13;
manual for the economic appraisal of projects, which still does not discuss&#13;
the assessment of management constraints. The contention is that as an&#13;
economic appraisal guide, management is outside its brief; and yet management&#13;
problems have a direct impact on the IRR. The manual is widely distributed&#13;
for use in developing countries, unaccompanied by guidelines for management&#13;
appraisal. It can only contribute to the present emphasis on ever more&#13;
"accurate" economic analysis which is in fact meaningless if implementation&#13;
does not go as planned.&#13;
The problems of professional bias are not limited to economists.&#13;
Most practitioners are trained and must develop their careers within a par-&#13;
ticular discipline (engineering, agronomy) and this predisposes evaluators&#13;
to see problems in sectoral terms. (The recent generations of multi-&#13;
disciplinary Development Studies graduates have had as yet little influence&#13;
in the field; the record suggests that they will tend towards academic and&#13;
policy roles.) The whole tradition of technical assistance reinforces this&#13;
tendency, since the assumption behind TA is technical ignorance, and as soon&#13;
as the problem is defined in these terms, the prescription of a sector expert&#13;
follows naturally. The wrong definition of problems through approaches&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
concentrating on sectoral/technical symptoms contributes to the neglect of&#13;
management root causes.&#13;
Problems of Access and Sensitivity&#13;
Management problems are not only hard to pin down: they are for&#13;
practical reasons extremely difficult to inquire into. This is a par-&#13;
ticularly intractable problem for the funding agency looking at implementing&#13;
institutions from the outside, with only fleeting and partial glimpses of how&#13;
"the Organization Chart" works in practice. The ideal approach of par-&#13;
ticipant observation from within the management structure is seldom avail-&#13;
able. In practice, key management decisions are taken at closed meetings,&#13;
and may cause problems in the field long afterwards, or in sectors other than&#13;
those at which the decisions were aimed. The funding agency has little&#13;
access to the decision-making process unless it is fortunate enough to have&#13;
technical assistance officers at key points in the organization---something&#13;
which recipients tend to resist strenuously. The result is that evaluations&#13;
inevitably concentrate on the results of poor management which are visible,&#13;
rather than the causes of poor management which may be far distant both in&#13;
space and time.&#13;
The problem oi access is compounded by the sensitivit;y of manage-&#13;
ment issues, especially in the case of the aid agency. Aid has to tread a&#13;
narrow line between acting as an agent of change and development and "inter-&#13;
vention in the internal affairs of another country." Too much or too obvious&#13;
concern with the management question can be dangerous from this point of&#13;
view, since this involves directing the use of local as well as aid-imported&#13;
resources--and since resources in both these categories are by definition&#13;
very scarce in the developing countries, the issue of who controls them is a&#13;
particularly sensitive one. Useful approaches to the assessment and improve-&#13;
ment of management performance must therefore take into accouni: the aid&#13;
agency's limited access and its need to tread carefully.&#13;

CHAPTER TWO&#13;
WHY EMPHASIZE INCENTIVES AND POLITICS?&#13;
Following the 1960s' emphasis on government-wide administrative&#13;
systems, a number of approaches have been made to management analysis and&#13;
assistance at the level of the implementing organization. However, most of&#13;
these have not been widely applied, despite their considerable contribution&#13;
(see, for example, the "procedural" approach to rural management developed by&#13;
Belshaw and Chambers for the Special Rural Development Programme in Kenya&#13;
(Chambers, 1974); an application of western organization theory to the exten-&#13;
sion service in Kenya (Leonard, 1977); numerous applications of MBO techni-&#13;
ques (for an exposition of the theory aimed specifically at the public sector&#13;
see Morrisey, 1976)). Of the approaches that have been more generally&#13;
adopted, two stand out as receiving most emphasis: the structural reform of&#13;
organizations, and management training.&#13;
Structure and Symbolic Action&#13;
The question of structure has always been important to political&#13;
scientists concerned with the process of structural differentiation and&#13;
integration, seen both as evolutionary and as the essence of administrative&#13;
development. But a more simple rationale for a good deal of attention to&#13;
structure is the access problem outlined above. The Organization Chart is&#13;
(generally) readily available, and is one of the few concrete pieces of&#13;
information about the recipient organization that the practitioner can gather&#13;
in a short evaluation; he is naturally tempted to rely heavily upon it in his&#13;
plans and recommendations. The structural approach has clear relevance.&#13;
Structural reform can help to promote coordination between agencies, and&#13;
emphasize important new areas of activity. But its limitations become clear&#13;
in practice, when "informal" management systems--especially prevalent in the&#13;
developing countries--short-circuit the design of the Organization Chart,&#13;
leaving it no more than an academic blueprint.&#13;
As a result, structural reform is often merely symbolic action.&#13;
For example, a new Community Development Unit may be created on an&#13;
"integrated" rural settlement project which has been concentrating on con-&#13;
struction at the expense of social development. But whether the new struc-&#13;
ture achieves anything will depend on whether the new unit receives adequate&#13;
physical and manpower resources, and the continuing attention and support of&#13;
top local management. Without the latter, unit staff will have no incentive&#13;
to perform. The effectiveness of "symbolic" action is enhanced by the confu-&#13;
sion between substantive outcomes (an effective change of emphasis in the&#13;
field) and symbolic results (structural change). This confusion can be such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
that often no cynical interpretation of management action is necessary. As&#13;
Pfeffer points out (Pfeffer, 1980: 72), "If it sounds as if managers (and&#13;
politicians more generally) are playing an intentionally deceptive game, this&#13;
is not the point, in that managers and politicians fool themselves as well as&#13;
each other with their symbolic acts." Structural reform, therefore, is use-&#13;
less unless the incentives exist for new structures to be used effectively.&#13;
Manpower Planning and the Resource Gap Approach to Development&#13;
The manpower planning approach is based on the undeniable fact that&#13;
developing countries face a severe shortage of trained managers. It thus&#13;
rests on the traditional "resource gap" approach to development.. In its more&#13;
crude form of the 1960s--when the belief was that filling the foreign&#13;
exchange and technical gaps would automatically lead to development--this has&#13;
now disappeared. But simply because the two main offerings of t:he aid agen-&#13;
cies are capital aid and technical assistance, they naturally tend to seek&#13;
out the gaps that these can fill, and so perpetuate the gap approach, but&#13;
now at the project rather than the macro level. There is of course no&#13;
shortage of consultants ready to penetrate an expanding market in the provi-&#13;
sion of management seminars in developing countries. Here, too, there is an&#13;
element of symbolic action. The aid agency, having hired an expensive con-&#13;
sultant, can feel reassured that it has provided "the best in the west." The&#13;
recipient organization can use its complement of "trained" managers to sup-&#13;
port its case for increased funding and expansion, irrespective of whether&#13;
training has actually led to better results. The foreign training of third&#13;
world managers also has its dangers. Western management school,3 concentrate&#13;
on technique, at the expense of studying the management environment in which&#13;
the techniques are supposed to be used. So often, managers trained in&#13;
whatever system return with raised expectations of what they should be able&#13;
to achieve and become frustrated and cynical when "the system" nullifies&#13;
their attempts at innovation.&#13;
An Incentives Approach&#13;
An incentives approach asks a more fundamental question than either&#13;
the structure or manpower planning approaches. In terms of assessing&#13;
organizations, they look, at structure and skill resources and ask what the&#13;
oganization is capable of doing. An incentives approach asks not just what&#13;
it can do, but what it is actually likely to do, given the pressures and&#13;
incentives acting on its constituent members. An incentives approach does&#13;
not claim to be more important than the other approaches, since it is clearly&#13;
crucial to establish the limits of capability. But most organizations in the&#13;
developing countries are working well inside the limits of their capability&#13;
as defined by their structure and skills. It can therefore be argued that&#13;
attention to incentives and motivation is attention to the constraint that is&#13;
often the limiting one in practice, and hence that it balances and comple-&#13;
ments the traditional approaches. Their assumption is that organizations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
"want to but can't," while a motivational approach suggests that sig-&#13;
nificantly often it is a case of "can do much better but won't." The tradi-&#13;
tional approaches fail to explain the persistence of poor management and&#13;
performance even when the majority of resource constraints are lifted--the&#13;
case of agricultural development in pre-revolutionary Iran is an example.&#13;
They also fail to explain how surprisingly effective performance can emerge&#13;
against all the odds (in terms of resource shortages) in projects or parts of&#13;
projects where there is a real commitment to the goal in question. The&#13;
suggestion is therefore that motivation is the "ultimate" constraint, in that&#13;
it can overrule structure and manpower both negatively and positively. Real&#13;
commitment to project goals can produce results despite ill-conceived struc-&#13;
tures and untrained manpower: while poorly motivated managers will achieve&#13;
little with the best of training and in the most appropriate of structures.&#13;
Most of the reasons for neglect of the management factor in general&#13;
also explain neglect of motivation and incentives in particular. Motivational&#13;
problems can be hard to pin down: managers who are uncommitted to achieving&#13;
project goals can easily find reasons why it is difficult or impossible to do&#13;
better--and have every incentive to do so. For all the reasons--of approach,&#13;
access and sensitivity--outlined above, the evaluator or senior manager may&#13;
find it hard to counter their arguments. Certainly he will get little help&#13;
in his analysis from management theory. The major proportion of the substan-&#13;
tial research literature on motivation has been developed in the West, and&#13;
has not been applied to the special conditions of the bureaucratic system in&#13;
the developing world. The small volume of empirical work carried out within&#13;
such bureaucracies is the most useful. This has brought out the importance of&#13;
motivation, but generally with particular reference to the need for a person-&#13;
nel management system and career structure which provide an incentive for&#13;
good work. This is an extremely important aspect of the incentives question,&#13;
but it has been applied primarily as part of the institutional framework&#13;
affecting staff across the particular tier of the hierarchy being studied. A&#13;
central theme of this paper (Chapter Four) is that motivational factors are&#13;
of equal importance as they operate vertically through the hierarchy, with&#13;
the attitudes and priorities of individual superiors affecting the behavior&#13;
of subordinates down the line. Thus the motivation of field staff can depend&#13;
on the attitudes and actions of managers far above in the hierarchy, a link&#13;
which studies concentrating on one level of the organization cannot examine&#13;
closely.&#13;
Motivation and Public. Management in the West&#13;
Porter and Perry (1979) provide a state-of-the-art summary of&#13;
motivation research as it applies to management in the public sector. While&#13;
"the list of motivational techniques presently used by employers is exten-&#13;
sive: monetary incentives, goal setting, flexitime, job enlargement, job&#13;
enrichment, behavior modification, participation, award and recognition&#13;
plans, discipline and counseling," they point out that most motivational&#13;
techniques are derived from four fundamental methods of motivation, on which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
most research has concent:rated. These are: monetary incentives, job design,&#13;
goal setting and participation.&#13;
Field studies in the west indicate that monetary incentives result&#13;
in significant performance improvements. Unfortunately, these t:ypes of&#13;
incentive are a limited option for managers and advisers in development.&#13;
First, monetary incentives work best in situations where goals and measures&#13;
of success are clear and readily quantifiable (e.g., profit in business), and&#13;
hence where reward is more easily linked to performance. Development goals&#13;
tend to be vague and conElicting (Chapter Three), and success due to team&#13;
rather than individual effort. While there is nevertheless a great deal of&#13;
potential for effective monetary incentive systems in development, these are&#13;
likely to be still harder to design than in public management in the west.&#13;
Second, and more fundamentally, it is difficult in most situations for&#13;
project managers or aid agency advisers to alter monetary rewards at the&#13;
project or organization level. Financial reward systems tend to be set on an&#13;
across-the-board Ministry- or even Civil Service-wide basis, and centrally&#13;
controlled. Attempts to alter these on a piecemeal basis may be seen as&#13;
threatening established differentials and resisted. The limited scope for&#13;
action here is considered further in Chapter 5 (p. 40).&#13;
With regard to the second motivational technique, Porter and Perry&#13;
comment that:&#13;
evaluating the effectiveness of job design is more&#13;
difficult than other motivational techniques because&#13;
it is usually implemented in conjunction with feedback&#13;
and other structural changes... If the performance&#13;
contributions of the goal setting component of job design&#13;
programs are controlled, job design might have no further&#13;
effects on performance. The contributions of job design&#13;
to public-sect:or performance are equally problematic....&#13;
No rigorous evaluation of applications of the technique&#13;
is available.&#13;
More research appears to be needed before this technique can be offered with&#13;
confidence to the developing countries.&#13;
Participation---"some type of shared or joint decision-making&#13;
between superiors and subordinates at the work group, program or organi-&#13;
zational level"--appearS to lead to the lowest median performance improvement&#13;
of the four main techniques. In addition, Porter and Perry not:e that&#13;
"because our understanding of the effects of participation is so limited, it&#13;
is extremely difficult to judge its probable efficiency as a motivational&#13;
tool in government." Yet the possibilities of participation techniques cannot&#13;
be ignored because: (1) participation is a currently fashionable topic in&#13;
development; (2) it is accepted that development must become more client-&#13;
oriented and hence administration more "bottom-up" and less "top-down;" (3)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
there is empirical evidence that participation has more possibilities in&#13;
development that it apparently has in public sector management in the West.&#13;
These possibilities are considered further below, especially in Chapter Five.&#13;
Goal setting is defined broadly by Porter and Perry as involving&#13;
"establishing observable standards for employee performance and offering&#13;
feedback to the employee about the extent to which standards have been&#13;
achieved. Techniques for goal setting.... come in a variety of formats,&#13;
including performance targets, management by objectives, and work standards."&#13;
It is in this general group that a "management by incentives" approach&#13;
belongs. This paper develops such an approach in the context of a political&#13;
interpretation of processes within implementing agencies which shape&#13;
managers' incentives. The final purpose of this chapter is to set the&#13;
political approach to bureaucracy in its place beside other current&#13;
approaches.&#13;
Conceptions of Bureaucracy&#13;
Organizations cannot be viewed objectively, but only through the&#13;
selective interpretations and accumulated habits of thought of the observer.&#13;
There is a fascinating inconsistency in current views of development&#13;
bureaucracies. Development practitioners with field experience see all too&#13;
well the key importance of bureaucratic politics in project success or.&#13;
failure. Yet the management approaches of funding agencies seem to imply&#13;
that organizational politics do not exist. The key-note of current analysis&#13;
and prescription is rationality--the philosophy at the root of all western&#13;
techniques from CBA through MBO and PPBS. The rationalist solution implies a&#13;
problem to which rationalism is the answer--that is, a bureaucratic system&#13;
that is fundamentally rationalist but which has gone awry, like a clock in&#13;
need of repair. In this sense, the technical assistance solution is like the&#13;
provision of missing parts--provision of the missing ingredient which will&#13;
set the system ticking as it should. If western remedies are based on a&#13;
rationalist premise, it is entirely logical for western practitioners to&#13;
implicitly assume the rational model for their clients. But there are per-&#13;
suasive alternatives, and the question is too important to be allowed to&#13;
escape analysis.&#13;
Pfeffer (1981: 18-33) has summarized four conceptual approaches to&#13;
organizations in an extremely important discussion of the role of power in&#13;
organizations. Table 1 is taken directly from this source. It can well be&#13;
argued that current implicit assumptions about development bureaucracies&#13;
revolve around the first three models in this table rather than the last.&#13;
The bureaucratic model, in the Western tradition, is the structural model on&#13;
which most colonial bureaucracies were founded. The rationalist model is&#13;
that implicit in most modern management techniques. The decision process&#13;
model is a newer arrival, exemplified by the "garbage can model" of organiza-&#13;
tional choice developed by Cohen, March and Olsen (1972). Pfeffer (1981:&#13;
26) summarizes this model, which appears highly relevant to the development&#13;
bureaucracy:&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
The basic idea of the model is that decision points are&#13;
opportunities into which various problems and solutions&#13;
are dumped by organizational participants. "In a&#13;
garbage can situation, a decision is an outcome of an&#13;
interpretation of several relatively independent 'streams'&#13;
within an organization." (Cohen, March and Olsen, 1976:&#13;
26). The streams consist of problems, solutions (which&#13;
are somebody's product), participants, and choice&#13;
opportunities. The decision process models developed by&#13;
March and his colleagues emphasize the problematic nature&#13;
of participation by various social actors in choices. They&#13;
note that systems are frequently so overloaded with problems,&#13;
solutions and decision opportunities that any given social&#13;
actor will attend to only certain decisions.&#13;
Cohen, March and Olsen (1972) developed a simulation of&#13;
the garbage can decision process. One of the important&#13;
conclusions emerging from that simulation is:&#13;
that although the processes within the garbage&#13;
can are understandable and in some ways predictable,&#13;
events are not dominated by intention. The&#13;
processes and the outcomes are likely to appear to&#13;
have no close relation with the specific intentions&#13;
of actors. In situations in which load is heavy and&#13;
the structure is relatively unsegmented, intention is&#13;
lost in context dependent flow of problems, solutions,&#13;
people and choice opportunities (Cohen, March and&#13;
Olsen, 1976: 37).&#13;
The garbage can model is useful in that, combined with the traditional con-&#13;
cept of bureaucracy, the result is the sort of model of development organiza-&#13;
tions that appears to be implicit in the "technical assistance approach."&#13;
The picture is one of resource-poor bureaucracy facing a complex reality and&#13;
struggling to deal with this through the sorts of rational, standardized&#13;
rules and procedures that under-trained staff can grasp and operate&#13;
(bureaucracy): but the system is overloaded, and the result is often&#13;
unplanned, haphazard action as the rules of rationality break down (the&#13;
garbage can).&#13;
If this is in fact the way the bureaucratic world works most of the&#13;
time, then training and technical solutions should be enough. But if, on the&#13;
other hand, the political model of bureaucracy is often dominant, then the&#13;
rationalist approach will often fail, through not taking account of the&#13;
political environment within and around recipient organizations. If a given&#13;
rationalist solution does not appeal to a dominant political coalition, it&#13;
can de dealt with in at least three ways. It can be simply rejected, as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
physical organism may reject a transplanted organ that does not suit its&#13;
host; it can be adopted but defused, by substituting symbolic action for&#13;
substantive results; or it can be adopted but turned to serve the informal&#13;
goals of the coalition itself. This paper does not argue that politics&#13;
dominates rationalism and the garbage can all of the time. But it does argue&#13;
that the political nature of development bureaucracy has been neglected: and&#13;
it does argue (Chapter Three) that the apparently unplanned, haphazard&#13;
results of much bureaucratic activity are often in fact outcomes which suit&#13;
important political interest groups, and hence not nearly as random as they&#13;
seem. That is to say, bureaucratic politics has its own rationality, which&#13;
is not the rationality of the transferable management tool. It is against&#13;
this background that an incentives approach to management must be developed.&#13;

CHAPTER THREE&#13;
BUREAUCRACY AS POLITICS&#13;
Initiative, energy and enthusiasm injected at any point in the&#13;
bureaucratic system seem to be absorbed and lost, like water poured into&#13;
sand. The purpose here is to put forward a perspective on the role and&#13;
operation of the bureaucracy which has some power to explain this "blotting-&#13;
paper effect," and its perpetuation often in the face of considerable pres-&#13;
sure for reform. In addition to the well known work of Riggs and LaPalom-&#13;
bara, relevant analysis of politics in third world bureaucracies can be found&#13;
in Grindle (1977); Cleaves (1974); Heginbotham (1975); Ness (1967); Hansen&#13;
(1971). But, as indicated above, there is a lack of material summarizing and&#13;
systematizing with the needs of the practitioner in mind. Jon Moris (1977)&#13;
gives perhaps the most useful (in that it is both penetrating and brief)&#13;
summary of third world administrative culture and its conflict with the&#13;
assumptions underlying western management concepts.&#13;
Official Goals and Bureaucratic Management Systems&#13;
Rural development as the official mandate of a bureaucracy usually&#13;
implies the grafting of a new set of values and goals onto a system designed&#13;
with different priorities in mind. Both colonial and traditional government&#13;
systems encouraged the development of hierarchical, authoritarian structures&#13;
and attitudes, whose ultimate goal was to avoid altering the balance of power&#13;
in favor of the population. Modern ideas of development, on the other hand,&#13;
stress that to be effective change must be brought about with the participa-&#13;
tion and support of the population. While traditional systems look from the&#13;
top down, modern theories of development look from the bottom up, and see the&#13;
major administrative requirement as responsiveness to a "clientele." The key&#13;
characteristics of the new development goals are their multi-purpose and&#13;
qualitative nature, and the relative difficulty in measuring success in&#13;
reaching them. The range of aims is both wide and often conflicting--growth&#13;
versus equity, urban versus rural emphasis, conflicting or complementing&#13;
alternatives of sectoral development, etc. It is much harder to measure&#13;
success, both because the relative importance of different goals is usually&#13;
not spelled out by politicians and planners, and because many of the possible&#13;
goal alternatives are themselves very hard to define and measure--for&#13;
example, social development, improving the quality of life, widening choice,&#13;
etc. The consequences for management performance are extremely significant.&#13;
The most obvious contrast is with management in the private sector where, by&#13;
and large, there is a single criterion of success--profitability. Such a&#13;
generally recognized criterion allows the relative performance of individuals&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
and departments to be measured and, broadly speaking, allows the organizaton&#13;
to function on "zero-based" principles. The public development sector&#13;
starts, by contrast, not with a zero base, but with one actively unsuited to&#13;
present needs; and with ill-defined goals which impede the application of&#13;
zero-based procedures to determine which parts of which organizations are&#13;
making an inadequate or inappropriate contribution.&#13;
The special complexity of development goals is often used to make&#13;
the case for less mechanistic and more organic management systerns. Organic&#13;
systems are "appropriate to changing conditions, which give rise constantly&#13;
to fresh problems and unforeseen requirements for action which cannot be&#13;
broken down or distributed automatically arising from the functional roles&#13;
defined within a hierarchic structure" (Burns and Stalker, 1961: 121).&#13;
Burns' and Stalker's full summary of the characteristics of the mechanistic&#13;
and organic systems is given in Appendix 1. It cannot be denied either that&#13;
the mechanistic system rather accurately describes the bureaucratic model, or&#13;
that organic approaches seem likely to have the best results in devising&#13;
appropriate solutions tc, development problems. Information-sharing and the&#13;
key contribution to decision-making of farmers and junior officials are to be&#13;
gained by consultation rather than command. However, in practice, three&#13;
important objections can be levelled at the practicality of organic forms of&#13;
management. As Burns and Stalker point out (1961: 122), the location of&#13;
authority is settled by consensus in the organic system, based on the loca-&#13;
tion of greatest expertise. But, in the development case, this implies&#13;
political change, in that those with greatest relevant expertise may well be&#13;
junior officials in direct touch with farmers, or technical experts, rather&#13;
than senior administrators. Such overt disturbance of the political staitus&#13;
quo is unlikely to be acceptable. The second problem is to be found in the&#13;
fact that "commitment is expected to approach that of a professional scien-&#13;
tist to his work....   The emptying out of significance from the hierarchic&#13;
command system is countered by the development of shared beliefs about the&#13;
values and goals of the concern." If, as argued below, development managers&#13;
have informal aims other than those of official development goals, such&#13;
commitment cannot automatically be expected, and the removal of structure and&#13;
discipline is likely to lead to less effective performance.&#13;
The comparison with the professional scientist is significant. The&#13;
fact is that the organic management model is best suited to organizations&#13;
such as research groups, where each member has a high degree of professional&#13;
competence, high commitment and roughly equal status. The development equiv-&#13;
alent would be a consultancy team involved in research or project planning.&#13;
This is the opposite of what is found in the development bureaucracy con-&#13;
cerned with implementation. Junior officials have low status, and tend to be&#13;
poorly trained and without the multidisciplinary vision that development&#13;
problem-solving requires. The fact is that if things are to get done by the&#13;
average official, the implementation process does have to be broken down into&#13;
clearly defined, easily communicable, readily checked activities. This is&#13;
the third and most fundamental objection to organic management--that it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
implies a general level of professional training and mutual respect which&#13;
cannot be hoped for among junior level officials in the developing countries.&#13;
These objections suggest that organic systems are recommended without suffi-&#13;
cient consideration' of political and practical realities. But the implica-&#13;
tions of these objections go further, in that they actually stand the&#13;
pro-organic argument on its head. Existing mechanistic organizations are not&#13;
merely unfortunately present, with a vested interest in preserving the status&#13;
quo. Systems that are fundamentally mechanistic/bureaucratic rather than&#13;
organic are in fact absolutely necessary. The complex official goals of&#13;
poverty-oriented development somehow have to be translatable into "standard&#13;
operating procedures," or the hope of widely replicated results may just as&#13;
well be given up. It is therefore suggested here that the problem to be&#13;
addressed is not the perpetuation of bureaucracy itself, but the fact that&#13;
the vagueness of development goals and the difficulties of measuring success&#13;
allow and encourage the pursuit of informal political goals within the&#13;
bureaucratic system, which may in practice be of greater significance to&#13;
managers than official goals.&#13;
Unofficial Priorities: Politics, Power and Conflict&#13;
A bargaining-power approach is one way of looking at the higher&#13;
levels of bureaucracy as a political system, insofar as aims within the&#13;
bureaucracy conflict. The formal power of ministers is almost unlimited, but&#13;
in practice seldom as total as it may seem. Management theory has researched&#13;
the link between technical knowledge and power: it has spent less time on the&#13;
link between power and knowledge of the bureaucracy itself. Though the top&#13;
civil servant increasingly has a professional and often technical training,&#13;
his ability to get results depends on his ability (as a "generalist") to&#13;
manipulate the system--an ability which will rest largely on the personal&#13;
contacts and following he will have built up over his career. He may thus&#13;
largely control what is done:   at the same time, he will almost certainly&#13;
control the reporting of what is and is not done. The minister has little&#13;
time for personal inspection of performance in the field, and the civil&#13;
servant therefore has considerable power, through selective reporting, to&#13;
control the minister's picture of reality in the field and of his ministry's&#13;
effectiveness. Thus, where interests conflict, an informal bargain will be&#13;
struck on an equilibrim level of performance which will give the politician&#13;
more or less satisfactory implementation of his policies, and the civil&#13;
servant a greater or lesser degree of autonomy in controlling his department.&#13;
This sort of cooperation/autonomy bargain is repeated at lower&#13;
levels throughout the bureaucracy, and also in horizontal relationships with&#13;
coordinating agencies. The main means of securing autonomy--the power of&#13;
independent action--is through the securing of resources. The struggle for&#13;
resources is a familiar part of the planning/budgeting process in developed&#13;
country bureaucracies, and it is naturally intensified in conditions of&#13;
resource scarcity in the third world. In the west, however, the planning&#13;
process has become ever more open to public input and inquiry, and the result&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
is that by the time of implementation there is generally a broad consensus on&#13;
program legitimacy (though even in the west it seems likely that the&#13;
prevalence of political game-playing during implementation has been underes-&#13;
timated:  see, for exampLe, Pressman and Wildavsky, 1973 and Bardach, 1977).&#13;
In the developing world--even in democratic states--the planning process is&#13;
much more private. As Moris (1977: 80) puts it: "Before decisions have&#13;
been announced, they are 'sensitive' and 'confidential'--not suitable for&#13;
discussion, but once launched they become 'policy,' which is equally&#13;
sacrosanct." As a result (Moris, 1977: 79):&#13;
there is a flexible attitude toward plans, which are viewed as&#13;
paper commitments mirroring a certain situation in power rela-&#13;
tionships at one point in time. Power relationships and circum-&#13;
stances change: as they do, so will the urgency of carrying out&#13;
mutually agreed act:Lons. If there is any uncertainty about&#13;
the authority relationships, implementation will be held in&#13;
abeyance.&#13;
There are therefore at least two reasons why bureaucratic conflict&#13;
is such a feature of impLementation in the third world. First, there is&#13;
often a lack of formal political input at the planning stage, which means&#13;
that those interested in opposing a particular plan may be effectively&#13;
obliged to attempt to block it at the implementation rather tharL the planning&#13;
stage. The legitimacy of the plan is not an accepted fact, but constantly&#13;
questionable and negotiable through the implementation process. Second, the&#13;
principle of conflict is legitimated by the very scarcity of resources. In&#13;
the west, plans are broa,lly tailored to resource availability, and resources&#13;
can therefore be divided up rationally according to plan. In the third&#13;
world, it is normal to find that the resources implied in plans and budgets&#13;
vastly exceed actual availability. It is then up to implementing officials&#13;
to struggle for whatever resources they can get: and naturally, they will&#13;
use whatever political power they can command in this struggle, in the&#13;
knowledge that the acquisition of resources will reinforce that power and&#13;
hence the chances of success the next time around. As Sapolsky puts it:&#13;
"What distinguishes programs in government is not that some&#13;
play politics and others do not, but rather, that some are&#13;
better at it than others" (Sapolsky, 1972: 244).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Unofficial Priorities: Politics, Personalism and Patronage&#13;
The use of personalism and patronage for political ends is a&#13;
well-known departure from the Weberian model:&#13;
The civil service incorporates microhierarchies of limited scope&#13;
with many internal levels even where such a steep hierarchy is&#13;
unnecessary. There is an intense internal politicization of the&#13;
junior officers, who line up beneath various patrons in the hope&#13;
that they may thereby gain advancement and recognition. Whom one&#13;
knows and not what one does is regarded as the key to personal&#13;
betterment....  Personal influence is seen as crucial for making&#13;
the informal system work, and everyone remains highly sensitized&#13;
to the power implications of each change of leadership and office&#13;
(Moris, 1977: 79).&#13;
Power brings with it possibilities for patronage--the offer of&#13;
employment, security, privilege, promotion, delegated power, and perhaps&#13;
opportunity for corrupt gain--which in themselves, through obligation to&#13;
loyalty, increase the power and security of the patron. The client of a&#13;
patron is loyal to the patron as an individual rather than head of depart-&#13;
ment, and personal relationships tend to govern the vertical exercise of&#13;
authority. Horizontally across the hierarchy, coordination is achieved less&#13;
by statutory links between officials than by the existence or non-existence&#13;
of personal ties. The old-boy network developed by a career civil servant is&#13;
often the most effective practical basis for cooperation between departments&#13;
or divisions, and this system tends to function on an exchange basis, where&#13;
cooperation and coordination are seen as favors for which an equivalent favor&#13;
will at some time be demanded in return. Through this system of mutual&#13;
reward, the senior civil servant can achieve things which the official system&#13;
cannot, and because this makes him indispensable, he has a vested interest in&#13;
the perpetuation of an "informal" management system. Similarly, because the&#13;
patronage system increases his power and security, he has a vested interest&#13;
in opposing the institution of more formal, merit-based personnel management&#13;
systems. The top civil servant excels at operating within the system, and&#13;
hence it is logical for him to judge any new project or proposal according to&#13;
its effects on that system, and his place in it.&#13;
Unofficial Priorities: Politics and the "Coalition of Indifference"&#13;
The patronage system is only subsidiary to the struggle for power,&#13;
autonomy and stability--another weapon in the bureaucratic conflict. Infor-&#13;
mal personalist management systems (like unclear goals) imply a looser struc-&#13;
ture and hence greater scope for playing politics in the implementation&#13;
process. Yet the theme of politics, power and conflict is by itself inade-&#13;
quate to explain consistently poor bureaucratic performance. Using the&#13;
bargaining-power approach alone, it may well be argued that the successful&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
organization or interest: group is the one which secures sufficient resources&#13;
for effective performance in terms of official goals, thus justifying its&#13;
claims to be a worthy recipient of further resources. Conflict implies&#13;
winners and losers, but not necessarily consistently poor performance even&#13;
among winners. The limitation of the bargaining-power approach to organiza-&#13;
tions is that it stresses conflict at the expense of agreement, just as the&#13;
ecological approach to Third World bureaucracies has tended to stress their&#13;
differences rather than their similarities. Yet it is readily arguable that&#13;
both politicians and senior civil servants represent a relatively unified&#13;
coalition of interest. Senior civil servants come from a privileged stratum&#13;
of society, which they share with politicians, businessmen, the military and&#13;
those in the professions. The divide between this stratum and the poor&#13;
majority is sharp. For the senior civil servant living in the middle-class&#13;
quarters of the city the main face-to-face contact with the poc,r may be his&#13;
relationship with his house servants. It would be surprising if the senior&#13;
civil servant did not identify primarily with middle-class values and&#13;
politics.&#13;
The themes of conflict and coalition among politicians and civil&#13;
servants within the same elite need not be incompatible. The primary source&#13;
of conflict is the allocation decision--as to which sector, ministry, depart-&#13;
ment or geographical area gets funds or other resources. Experience suggests&#13;
that the major bureaucratic and political effort goes to the securing of&#13;
resources, and a far lesser amount into the effective use of those resources&#13;
once secured. That is to say that each faction within the elite wants to&#13;
strengthen its relative position by extending its empire-- hence conflict:&#13;
but once the allocation decision is taken, it is often not in the direct&#13;
interests of any particular faction to devote its major effort to benefitting&#13;
the rural poor, who are outside the bureaucratic coalition of interest seen&#13;
as a whole. The bureaucracy is thus Janus-faced: its appearance of conflict&#13;
and disunity, seen from within, shifts to an appearance of unit:y--based on&#13;
common uninterest--when seen from below. This silent "coalition of indif-&#13;
ference" is as or more [mportant than the more immediately obvious competi-&#13;
tion for power. There is an intriguing if inexact analogy here with the&#13;
"trickle-down" theory of development, where theory suggested that the injec-&#13;
tion of resources into the already relatively developed sectors of an&#13;
economy, or into its re:Latively more prosperous groups, would lead, through a&#13;
variety of multiplier-effects, to development of more disadvant:aged sectors&#13;
and groups. Experience has shown that such policies tend to foster the&#13;
development of relativeLy prosperous enclaves while the benefits for the poor&#13;
are no more than a trickle.   In a similar way, injection of funds into the&#13;
higher levels of the bureaucracy can be seen as serving first and foremost&#13;
the unofficial aims of the bureaucracy (expansion, empire-building, etc.),&#13;
with benefits only "trickling down" to the target groups in the rural areas.&#13;
At the inter-project level, this may mean unbalanced development through&#13;
selection of projects that do least to upset the rural balance of power or&#13;
alienate influential local elites. At the intra-project level it may mean&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
excessive attention, say, to the award of contracts and much less attention&#13;
to their performance in the field.&#13;
At the more general level of international political systems, this&#13;
dual view of bureaucracy as both in conflict and coalition is not simply&#13;
applicable to pluralist systems and Myrdal's "soft state," where political&#13;
competition and indiscipline lead to poor performance in the development&#13;
field. For if bureaucracy shares with the leadership a coalition of indif-&#13;
ference to the poor, the administration of a harder or non-democratic state&#13;
need be no more effective in terms of rural development. In the Shah's Iran,&#13;
for example, the agricultural bureaucracy had powerful political backing and&#13;
almost unlimited resources, yet failed in its rural development policy by&#13;
standards of either production or equity. Its attention to the peasant&#13;
farmer (in those areas unaffected by agri-business and evictions) con-&#13;
centrated on the setting-up of cooperatives which succeeded more as instru-&#13;
ments of political control than of development. The non-democratic state may&#13;
therefore give the leadership a better chance of fulfilling its aims, but not&#13;
necessarily more effective rural development.&#13;
In summary, it is crucial to distinguish whether the bureaucracy&#13;
is impermeable (and the rural poor neglected) because it is incompetent, or&#13;
whether it is impermeable because the elite, inside and outside the&#13;
bureaucracy, has other political priorities--the fundamental question of&#13;
motivation which tends to be carefully skirted by the aid agencies. The&#13;
theme being developed is that existing bureaucratic systems tend to offer the&#13;
more powerful vested interests within them greater rewards than (by develop-&#13;
ment standards) more efficient systems. Administrative innovation tends to&#13;
destroy the informal management systems fundamental to the existing balance&#13;
of power within the bureaucracy, and is therefore naturally unwelcome. The&#13;
implication is that the perpetuation of centralization, duplication, red&#13;
tape, etc., is not merely the accidental result of "bungling bureaucracy,"&#13;
but is in the active interests of a system whose unofficial priorities are&#13;
not necessarily those of rural development. The following sections apply the&#13;
themes of power, conflict, personalism and coalition to explain the perpetua-&#13;
tion of some of the commonly accepted faults and attitudes of Third World&#13;
bureaucracies.&#13;
Centralization, Departmentalism and Duplication&#13;
It is in the political and personal interest of most civil servants&#13;
to be near the center. At the personal level, a base in the capital or&#13;
provincial center brings the advantages of city living--good schools for the&#13;
children, other amenities, closeness to friends and contacts. At the politi-&#13;
cal level, all major allocation decisions are taken in the capital, as are&#13;
all major decisions about promotion. The goals of both empire-building at&#13;
the departmental level and career advancement at the personal level are thus&#13;
best served by continued centralism. Advocates of decentralization for rural&#13;
development have taken insufficient account of the vested interests their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
proposals will disturb, and of the therefore highly political nature of their&#13;
administrative reforms.   Departmentalism is a similarly logical consequence&#13;
of conflict and empire-building. The aim, if a new proposal or policy is&#13;
seen to have opportunities, will be to internalize its execution within the&#13;
ministry or department and, conversely, to have as little as possible to do&#13;
with it if it offers no obvious departmental benefits (e.g., if it has no&#13;
great capital aid content, or little top-level political support). The&#13;
consequences are clear for the new generation of multi-disciplinary projects&#13;
requiring interdepartmental cooperation.   Some parts of such projects will&#13;
tend to offer greater political benefits to the leadership than other parts,&#13;
and will be pursued more enthusiastically. This will tend to identify the&#13;
project with one or two major ministries/departments concerned with the&#13;
politically popular elements. As soon as this happens, this further reduces&#13;
the incentive for other ministries/departments to make implementation of&#13;
their part of the project a priority, since credit for project success will&#13;
go primarily to the major departments with which the project is associated.&#13;
Functional duplication is a logical consequence of departmentalism.&#13;
Departments that wish to expand will tend to extend their range of activities&#13;
and services so that they can attract a maximum share of available resources,&#13;
and at the same time prevent competing departments expanding themselves---in&#13;
this way, an irrigation ministry, for example, might extend its own&#13;
activities into downstream agricultural development, thus paralLeling the&#13;
work of the ministry of agriculture. Competing departments who will not gain&#13;
major benefits from a given project or program will tend to cooperate and&#13;
coordinate poorly with the major implementing department, thus creating still&#13;
further incentives for that department to internalize the activiLties&#13;
involved, and so bring them under its own control. One of the main reasons&#13;
for the proliferation of area or river basin development boards with wide&#13;
powers is their ability to operate in a number of different functonal areas,&#13;
thus avoiding the problerms of inter-departmental coordination. New depart-&#13;
ments or ministries which duplicate other departments' official functions may&#13;
therefore either be examples of empire-building and the struggle for resour-&#13;
ces: or realistic attempts to counter the disadvantages of the existing&#13;
"inert" bureaucratic system by the creation of new organizations which are&#13;
independent, powerful andl able to achieve results.&#13;
Red Tape and Decision-Making&#13;
It is probably a mistake to assume that senior officials are as&#13;
hamstrung by the red tape of their own bureaucracies as they may sometimes&#13;
seem: certainly, the general argument that power is concentrated in the&#13;
hands of a few individuals at the top of the bureacracy would be inconsistent&#13;
with this. Red tape can have its own uses. If a senior official is faced&#13;
with a difficult decision, i.e., one which he fears may harm his department&#13;
or himself, he may usefully delay it by subjecting it to the procedures of&#13;
the bureaucracy. Similarly, he may delay the implementation of any policy,&#13;
program or project which is not in the direct interest of his department to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
pursue. It can also be argued that the informal management system provides&#13;
scope for avoiding red tape when it is profitable to do so, so that the&#13;
senior official may get the best of both worlds. The fact that the senior&#13;
levels of the bureaucracy function at least as much as individuals with their&#13;
personal followings and contacts as they do as officials with their formal&#13;
subordinates and colleagues means that an alternative management system is&#13;
available which can short-circuit the official one when the incentive is&#13;
there. A call to a contact in another department on the old-boy network may&#13;
produce the required material, service or decision where a official depart-&#13;
mental request would be delayed or ignored. The hallmarks of the official&#13;
management system are the committee and the minute, while the hallmarks of&#13;
the unofficial system are the informal meeting and the telephone call, with&#13;
little or nothing committed to paper. The second offers a remarkably attrac-&#13;
tive combination of speed in operation and unaccountability.&#13;
The gravitation of decision-making upwards has still more obvious&#13;
political advantages for senior bureaucrats, a major reason for the relative&#13;
lack of effective delegation in Third World bureaucracies. The senior&#13;
bureaucrat makes a performance/autonomy bargain with his juniors, just as the&#13;
politician does with his senior civil servants. Effective delegation invol-&#13;
ves a politically threatening shift in the balance of power toward the junior&#13;
level: clearly, however, responsibility must devolve to some extent if any&#13;
development action is to be taken. One common solution to this dilemma is&#13;
the assignment of particular tasks to junior levels, rather than the delega-&#13;
tion of general responsibilities. Power is thus not devolved, but granted&#13;
temporarily. The location of decision-making at the top of the hierarchy is&#13;
an effective reinforcement of the tendency towards centralism. Head office&#13;
interest is often particularly noticeable in two functional areas--budgeting&#13;
and personnel. From a political standpoint this is entirely logical, since&#13;
the budgeting procedure represents the intra-departmental resource allocation&#13;
decision, while questions of promotion and posting (and of foreign travel and&#13;
training) directly involve the question of patronage. It is therefore common&#13;
to find that the most minor decisions in these areas require authorization at&#13;
the highest level--often that of permanent secretary or minister.&#13;
Bureaucracy and the Farmers&#13;
Unfortunately, there is a dearth of serious material--perhaps&#13;
reflecting a lack of academic sympathy--on bureaucracy's&#13;
treatment of the individual as a claimant, plaintiff or&#13;
petitioner. For the layman who has infrequent but generally&#13;
unpleasant encounters with public administration, this&#13;
subject can represent a more agonizing problem (and a matter&#13;
crying more for reform) than the ability of self-interested&#13;
firms or tightly-knit mafiosa-type pressure groups to turn&#13;
public decisions to their liking (often accepted as an&#13;
inevitable fact of life). (Cleaves, 1974.)&#13;

Despite the recent efforts of a few more sympathetic academics&#13;
(see, for example, Schaffer and Lamb, 1974, and Harvey, 1979), from the&#13;
practical standpoint of a political view of bureaucracy, it is still only&#13;
too appropriate to consider the farmers last.   Development philosophy's&#13;
stress on the need for farmer involvement in project planning is relatively&#13;
recent. Before the rise of rural development as a priority, the rural sector&#13;
was seen as the passive fueller (through its tax revenues, labor and markets)&#13;
of industrial growth. The rural poor are all too often seen now as the&#13;
passive receivers of project benefits--and participation in benefits is all&#13;
too often confused with participation in its wider sense (Cohen and Uphoff,&#13;
1977). The cause of participation has been poorly served by thinkers in a&#13;
number of disciplines. Economists are concerned with equity, but not with&#13;
participation in economic planning. Sociologists and anthropologists have&#13;
concentrated on analyzing village societies, but have done very little work&#13;
on their interaction with the field agents of government. Finally, a major&#13;
school of development administration (Riggs et .al) has been concerned with&#13;
the idea of participation versus capacity--the very real problem that&#13;
increased participation in planning and decision-making slows the development&#13;
process and reduces the capacity of implementing agencies: yet has skirted&#13;
the more fundamental question of whether implementation carried out without&#13;
due attention to the perceptions and wishes of the local population can be&#13;
really beneficial. Implementation without increased participation may mean&#13;
increased government capacity to change but not necessarily to develop the&#13;
rural areas.&#13;
As things stand, therefore, the bureaucracy has no great need to&#13;
take account of the ruraL poor in its procedures. and decisions, except to the&#13;
extent that they represent a political force.   Practice in project areas&#13;
suggests that this is in fact what is happening. The poorer farmer's&#13;
experience of government is largely negative. Contact is more likely to be&#13;
with agencies of control (police, taxation) than of service (extension,&#13;
marketing). The latter, where available, and where they do answer a felt&#13;
need, are often too inconvenient or expensive to make use of, or simply&#13;
unreliable in quantity, quality or timing. The poorer farmer expects little&#13;
of the goverment, and his low expectations and lack of complaint provide no&#13;
incentive for the bureaucracy to improve performance. Complaint and higher&#13;
expectations tend to come from more prosperous and influential farmers, who&#13;
are anyway more likely to meet the formal (or informal) requirements for&#13;
participation in credit or cooperative programs. The result may be a&#13;
two-tier service, with different standards for rich and poor. Interestingly&#13;
in practice, pressures from the more prosperous for better or preferential&#13;
service will often not be exerted through official channels, but through an&#13;
informal approach to the bureaucract concerned--through a friend, or at a&#13;
meal or drink outside the formality of the goverment office. Such approaches&#13;
recognize and perpetuate the informal management system of the biireaucracy in&#13;
their dealings with the bureaucrat as patron rather than official.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
The enormous increase in government development activity in the&#13;
rural areas in recent years does not automatically imply a corresponding&#13;
increase in bureaucratic concern for the more disadvantaged members of the&#13;
rural population. It can even be argued that in some areas increased govern-&#13;
mental activity has encouraged the breakdown of village institutions that&#13;
helped to protect the interests of the very poor. For although the values of&#13;
traditional village society emphasized stability at the expense of creativity&#13;
and innovation (and were thus "anti-developmental"), and although power&#13;
rested for the most part in the hands of a few relatively prosperous landed&#13;
families, concentration of power and rights in a few hands often also implied&#13;
certain obligations and duties for the powerful. In much of Asia, for&#13;
example, the temple received gifts of land and funds from the rich and was a&#13;
major force in preserving the status quo of village politics, but at the same&#13;
time provided education and alms. Similarly, in Sri Lanka, where in a normal&#13;
season the vel vidane (water bailiff) distributed the bulk of village water&#13;
to the large landholders by whom he was selected, in a dry season custom&#13;
dictated that the land immediately below the reservoir with the most assured&#13;
supply of water was subject to a temporary land reform and redistributed to&#13;
all landowners, so that all were ensured a minimum subsistence crop of paddy.&#13;
Such sanctioned safeguards, if they did little to improve the lot of the very&#13;
poor, at least helped reduce the risk of disaster. Many other factors have&#13;
helped to break down former protective norms--for example, the break-up of&#13;
the extended family with the rise of the cash economy and the drift to&#13;
employment in the towns. But a major contributary cause is government inter-&#13;
vention--for example, development schemes which have raised the value of land&#13;
and encouraged more prosperous farmers to evict former tenants. The result&#13;
has been the growing assumption among the relatively well off that respon-&#13;
sibilities and obligations to the landless and very poor now belong to the&#13;
government, with official "social security" taking over from the traditional&#13;
security systems of village society in Asia and Africa, and of the latifundio&#13;
in South America. Unfortunately, it is exactly the landless and very poor&#13;
who are least likely to be able to disturb the bureaucratic coalition of&#13;
indifference.&#13;
Implications&#13;
The political approach to bureaucracy outlined above has crucial&#13;
implications for an incentives approach to the management of development.&#13;
If the dangers of mere "trickle down" through the bureaucracy are to be&#13;
avoided, and plans are to turn into action in the field, the implication is&#13;
that proposals must not only make sense for the client population of farmers,&#13;
but also for the officials involved in implementation. Development projects&#13;
and programs must be designed so as to provide an incentive, in terms of a&#13;
perceived personal advantage, for bureaucrats at each level and in every&#13;
department involved. This implies the addition of a new dimension to project&#13;
design--the assessment of motivation and incentives within implementing&#13;
agencies and the design of projects so as to win the support of as many as&#13;
possible of the key officials concerned. Projects must be planned for a&#13;
group of managers as well as for a group of clients.&#13;

CHAPTER FOUR&#13;
ASSESSING INCENTIVES&#13;
Recognizing Political Rationality&#13;
One basic assumption, implicit in the idea of bureaucracy as&#13;
politics, underlies the assessment of incentives--that individua:ls at all&#13;
levels in the organization are for the most part behaving rationally from&#13;
their own standpoint. Expectations of bureaucracy often implicitly accept&#13;
that its definitive qualities are apathy and ignorance--Koestler's simplistic&#13;
but revealing definition of bureaucracy, which he sees as the poLar opposite&#13;
of the meritocracy, defined as intelligence plus effort. The contrasting&#13;
approach put forward here is that implementing organizations contain large&#13;
reserves of intelligence and effort if appropriately stimulatecl: but that&#13;
this stimulus is often missing, and/or these reserves are often concentrated&#13;
in pursuit of unofficial goals which may not match those of funding agencies.&#13;
It is not rational for individuals or organizations to exert themselves in a&#13;
particular direction when there is insufficient incentive to do so: and it&#13;
can therefore very well be argued that the logical result in many bureau-&#13;
cracies is often a combLnation of Koestler's two definitions--a situation&#13;
where it is intelligent to be apathetic in pursuit of development goals. In&#13;
the discussion of bureaucracy as politics, an informal decision-rule for&#13;
civil servants was implied: "What political gain will implementing this&#13;
policy bring me?" Following from the above assumption about rationality a&#13;
parallel question needs to be asked by evaluators. The question the conven-&#13;
tional evaluator has aslced when examining progress in the field is "What has&#13;
gone wrong here?" The basic question proposed in contrast is "What are the&#13;
influences on the officLals involved which make this result/action/non-action&#13;
rational from their own point of view?" I.e., not "What makes this wrong?"&#13;
but "What makes this right?" This is the question that is basic to the&#13;
assessment of incentives. Asking this question directs attention to manage-&#13;
ment and motivational root causes, while asking "What has gone wrong?" is&#13;
more likely to direct attention to problem symptoms.&#13;
This notion of- bureaucratic rationaiity must be distinguished from&#13;
both "imperious" and "bounded" notions of rationality. This is clearly not&#13;
the objective rationality of Pfeffer's first model (Table 1, peage 11), since&#13;
the political model of bureaucracy implies behavior which is often not in the&#13;
rational interest of development goals. But nor is this merely bounded&#13;
rationality, which stil:L assumes that the individual is attempting to behave&#13;
in some objectively or ultimately rational manner, but is constrained from&#13;
doing so because of his imperfect knowledge and the bounds of his analytical&#13;
ability. In contrast, bureaucratic behavior is often based on rational&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
self-interest, an approach to managerial behavior which in itself is no new&#13;
one. It is implied in Herbert Simon's classic "Administrative Behavior"&#13;
(Simon, 1962: 243): "This is the basic task of administration--to provide&#13;
each 'operative' employee with an environment of decision of such a kind that&#13;
behavior which is rational from the standpoint of this environment is also&#13;
rational from the standpoint of the group values and the group situation."&#13;
It has been specifically applied to rural development by Chambers (1974),&#13;
for example:&#13;
Often, however, an examination of the work environment,&#13;
perceptions and expectations of field staff will show, not&#13;
that they are willfully negligent, but that they are reacting&#13;
rationally to a situation in which it is not clear what is&#13;
expected of them but in which it is clear that the exercise&#13;
of initiative in development matters is at least as likely to&#13;
be penalized as deviant behavior as rewarded for being good&#13;
work (p. 23), and (p. 61): What does emerge, however, is that&#13;
much of the inactivity and low work output can be understood&#13;
as a rational response to a combination of terms of service,&#13;
living conditions, working conditions and supervision.&#13;
Neither penalties nor rewards provide strong incentives for&#13;
better performance. In these circumstances, the potential&#13;
abilities of staff lie largely dormant, a latent but&#13;
unrealized resource. Staff could work eight hours a day&#13;
instead of five. They could visit more than just the&#13;
progressive elite of farmers. They could cover villages&#13;
and farmers more distant from the places where they live.&#13;
That they do not do these things is largely because they&#13;
are rational. The question is how to change their work&#13;
environment so that it becomes equally rational for them&#13;
to work harder and better.&#13;
What is now needed is formal recognition of the importance of rational&#13;
self-interest as defined by the patterns of incentives within recipient&#13;
organizations. The effects of this incentive climate on individuals must be&#13;
seen in proper perspective. Few officials are Machiavellian intriguers&#13;
seeking all the time for their own advancement. Most are more reactive than&#13;
proactive in their attitudes, and some are plain lazy and will be unrespon-&#13;
sive even to a custom-designed incentive system. The following three&#13;
bureaucratic types give a rough sense of the spectrum in the average&#13;
implementing agency:&#13;
1.   The Political Gamesman:   The idea of the gamesman is taken&#13;
from Maccoby's well-known analysis of top corporate leaders&#13;
(Maccoby, 1976). His book is subtitled "Winning and Losing&#13;
the Career Game", and this approach--to career as a game&#13;
to be won--is the key to the bureaucratic gamesman. As&#13;
a skilled politician, he will be highly sensitive to the&#13;
informal goals and priorities of the bureaucracy, to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
sources of power, and to the key officials and politicians&#13;
who are now or will become powerful. He will seek to advance&#13;
his career by selling politically appealing projects to&#13;
superiors and by implementing them in ways which take&#13;
account of informal priorities (the case study below gives&#13;
an example oi this). He will ensure that the incentive&#13;
systems controlling those below him reflect the informal&#13;
goals that are in his career interest to pursue.&#13;
2.   The Entrepreneur:   The approach of the entrepreneurial&#13;
bureaucrat can be described as follows: "Bureaucrats invest&#13;
their energies where there is the greatest prospect of&#13;
return. Developing country bureaucrats in particular are&#13;
constantly making calculations because they have so many&#13;
alternative :investment options both in terms of their daily&#13;
work (what meetings to skip, etc.) and in terms of their&#13;
medium-term career (which project is likely to mutate into&#13;
a corporation)" (John Howell, pers. comm.). The entre-&#13;
preneur bureaucrat has some of the characteristics of the&#13;
political garaesman. He has a career plan, and decides&#13;
his priorities on the basis of his medium term interest.&#13;
But he is reactive within a framework of investment&#13;
options, responsive to rather than creating possibilities&#13;
for advancement (the gamesman is more likely to propose&#13;
the project which later mutates into a corporation). The&#13;
entrepreneur s choice of priorities will affect the&#13;
incentives of those below him; but he is as much a&#13;
responder to incentives as he is an incentive-setter.&#13;
3.   The Incentive-Follower:   The majority of lower-level&#13;
officials are incentive-followers only. They are the&#13;
field staff described by Chambers, and in head office&#13;
they are the yes-men clients of political patrons.&#13;
Incentive-fo:Llowers are almost entirely reactive&#13;
responders: they have little concept of control over&#13;
their careers and may perhaps best be described not&#13;
as recognizing and reacting to positive incentives,&#13;
but as following the "line of least resistance" within&#13;
a given incentive pattern.&#13;
These categories are arbitrary in that all officials are to some&#13;
extent incentive-followers (the gamesman's reactions to superiors and to a&#13;
constraining environment) and all to an extent incentive-setters (the exten-&#13;
sion officer's effects on the motivation of client farmers). All are acting&#13;
in their rational self--interest given their career goals and limitations.&#13;
But it is. important, arnong these rational actors, to distinguish those who&#13;
are acting mainly as incentive-setters, since it is they who will control&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
attitudes and behavior in the organization, and ultimately the effectiveness&#13;
of implementation.&#13;
Key Interest Groups and Incentive-Setters&#13;
The assessment of incentives within implementing agencies can&#13;
validly concentrate on a small number of key groups or individuals and on&#13;
an examination of how far their motives and aims conflict with those of other&#13;
key groups, and those of project originators.&#13;
At the lower levels of organizations, interest groups are likely&#13;
to be large--for example, the entire field officer contingent at a particular&#13;
level of the extension service hierarchy. The entire group is likely to&#13;
share similar problems and incentives, just as will the entire group of their&#13;
immediate superiors. Groups will have different interests according to&#13;
department and function, as well as according to their position in the&#13;
hierarchy: extension officers will have very different problems and inter-&#13;
ests from those of water bailiffs, while water bailiffs are likely to form a&#13;
different interest group from that of, say, the irrigation engineers control-&#13;
ling them. The organization charts of the various departments involved may&#13;
thus be broken down very quickly into a series of groups which a priori may&#13;
be expected to have common internal interests and to be to some extent in&#13;
conflict with superior, subordinate or coordinating groups. Higher up in the&#13;
hierarchy, groups give way to individual managers with particular personal&#13;
interests. These groups may be cut across, or individuals may be united, by&#13;
other groupings, based not upon departmental, hierarchical or personal inter-&#13;
est, but on professional loyalty (e.g., engineers versus planners), race or&#13;
age (which may determine attitudes to or possibilities for career develop-&#13;
ment). When these groups are superimposed upon those derived direct from the&#13;
organization chart, the picture becomes more complicated: but it still does&#13;
not take account of the interest groups created by the informal management&#13;
systems of a political bureaucracy. Superimposed again must be patron-client&#13;
interest groups, which clearly will cut across horizontal hierarchical group-&#13;
ings, and are equally unlikely to be synonymous with formal departmental&#13;
groups. It begins to seem as if there are more intersecting, shifting coali-&#13;
tions in the organization than there are individuals.&#13;
In practice, however, the large number of groups that a sociologist&#13;
might isolate can be reduced to a few key groups and individuals whose&#13;
strategic placing gives them control over project performance. Given that&#13;
bureaucracies are basically authoritarian, the interests of more senior&#13;
individuals and groups tend to determine the incentives of those below.&#13;
Analysis should therefore start with the individuals near the head of the&#13;
organization, whose attitudes will tend to dictate the incentive system for&#13;
subordinates. If they share the aims of the project originators, attention&#13;
can be turned to those next in the hierarchy, with the aim of determining&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
where conflicts in motivation occur which break the chain of common inter-&#13;
est--for it will be at t:hese points that commitment and cooperation will be&#13;
lost, and the "trickle ctown" effect will become apparent.&#13;
The search for key interest groups and incentive-setters cannot,&#13;
however, be confined to the formal hierarchy. Those in a position to control&#13;
incentives are those who have power. Those with power, as the political&#13;
approach to bureaucracy suggests, are those who control resources: and the&#13;
control of key resources is far from limited to those with greatest formal&#13;
authority.  Starting-points for finding the incentive-setters would include&#13;
answers to the following questions:&#13;
1.   Who controls agendas.   The obvious controllers of the&#13;
organizational agenda are the planners who formally set&#13;
priorities in conjunction with top management. But 1:hose&#13;
with control over the agenda of important meetings and&#13;
committees or with the ear of top (formal) managers can&#13;
exert tremendous influence in seeing that certain&#13;
decisions/problems are confronted and others not.&#13;
2.   Who controls the budget process, central to the&#13;
distribution of resources.&#13;
3.   Who controls the procurement of physical resources.&#13;
Given that the actual budget is seldom sufficient for&#13;
all required resources, the process of equipment and&#13;
supply procurement gives scope for favoring particular&#13;
goals/activit:ies.&#13;
4.   Who controls the procurement and distribution of human&#13;
resources. The quality of staff assigned to different&#13;
activities can determine success or failure. So also&#13;
can the informal applications of formal policy with&#13;
regard to promotion, postings, housing, pay and&#13;
allowances, and in-service training.&#13;
5.   Which departments and interest groups actually get the&#13;
most/finest resources and most favorable treatment.&#13;
These may be the informal powers behind the thrones&#13;
of the budget, procurement, personnel and planning&#13;
processes.&#13;
6.   Who is irreplaceable.   Individuals who are irreplaceable&#13;
have power. They may have technical expertise that is&#13;
essential to the organization. They may simply be 1:he&#13;
relative of someone important outside the organizat-Lon.&#13;
They may have knowledge of complex bureaucratic proce-&#13;
dures or special contacts in other departments such as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
the Ministry of Finance: such "fixers" are crucial for&#13;
ensuring the steady supply of resources--including&#13;
the key resource of cooperation from coordinating&#13;
departments.&#13;
7.   Who controls information.   Information is perhaps the&#13;
greatest single source of informal power. The selection&#13;
and presentation of information largely determine&#13;
planning and the control of agendas, and also the&#13;
evaluation of performance (through selection among&#13;
objective judgment criteria, or simply distortion of&#13;
reports). Among key positions in the communications&#13;
network are those responsible for reporting and liaison&#13;
between head office and the field, and those responsible&#13;
for communication and coordination with other agencies.&#13;
Incentives, Priorities and Pressures&#13;
Breaking the organization down into a relatively small number of&#13;
key interest groups and incentive-setting officials is a somewhat crude&#13;
simplification of a complex reality: but this is necessary, since appraisal&#13;
must be rapid, and specific targets must be selected for assistance and&#13;
intervention, if attempts are later to be made to influence incentives.&#13;
Similarly, some systematic effort must be made to classify and interpret the&#13;
complex and often conflicting incentives and pressures that determine the&#13;
priorities of interest groups and individuals--whether gamesman,&#13;
entrepreneurs or followers. It is suggested that incentives as they affect&#13;
the individual or group can for practical purposes be simplified into four&#13;
sets of conflicting or complementary factors, which may be termed internal&#13;
priorities, official and unofficial pressures from superiors, and local&#13;
pressures.&#13;
Internal priorities may be defined as "intrinsic" motivation--that&#13;
is, the attitude of the individual or group to his or their career. In the&#13;
case of individual managers, personal levels of ambition may be important, as&#13;
may personal values: in the case of both individuals and groups, attitudes&#13;
towards work and career will be determined very largely by the personnel&#13;
management and reward system. Factors include salary and allowance levels,&#13;
opportunities for promotion and in-service training, questions of housing and&#13;
posting. This is the area which has received most attention from field&#13;
researchers, who have commented, for example, on the motivational implica-&#13;
tions of frequent personnel transfers in mid-project, and of alternative&#13;
promotion systems based on merit, nepotism or length of service. It is an&#13;
area of crucial importance, because it determines the basic attitudes and&#13;
outlook of officials at all levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
Official pressures from superiors tend to reflect the "party line",&#13;
for example, the goals of the project or program as set out by the govern-&#13;
ment. It is important to determine how far these are clearly expressed to&#13;
officers down the line and in the field. Junior officials and field officers&#13;
frequently share a different conception of the project from those of the&#13;
project originators, are unclear about their roles and goals, and hence&#13;
inevitably poorly motivated. Second only to the clarity of the official line&#13;
in importance is the way in which official pressure is exerted on subor-&#13;
dinates: the question of management style. Generalization is difficult,&#13;
because different civil services and departments within them eXhibit and&#13;
indeed expect different types of managerial behavior. A cooperative manage-&#13;
ment style appropriate in a department characterized by informal relation-&#13;
ships would be interpreted merely as a sign of weak leadership in a depart-&#13;
ment or culture that expected and respected authority and instructions.&#13;
There will also be a trade-off with the incentives provided by the personnel&#13;
management system--staff motivated by good salaries and conditions may be&#13;
prepared to tolerate more authoritarian management. However, more coopera-&#13;
tive management styles tend to encourage subordinates to share information&#13;
and problems more frequently with their superiors--an important advantage in&#13;
rural development, where "bottom-up" management is particularly important.&#13;
The presentation of the official line is therefore as important as its con-&#13;
tent.&#13;
Informal pressures from superiors are likely, in a political&#13;
bureaucracy, to be as important as official ones, and it is these that have&#13;
been seriously neglected. Informal pressures reflect the actual priorities&#13;
of superiors, where these are not in agreement with official priorities.&#13;
Subordinates are extrernely sensitive to these informal pressures, since it is&#13;
by their response to them that they are likely, de facto, to be judged by&#13;
their superiors. In the case of a subordinate with a wide-ranging job&#13;
description, the officLal line coming to him may be equal emphasis on his&#13;
various areas of responsibility:   but if it is in his superior's or the&#13;
department's interest to pursue one area rather than another, the subordinate&#13;
is likely to realize rather quickly what his best interests have become. For&#13;
example, if a superior's aim is to demonstrate progress in a new extension&#13;
campaign, and this can be presented in terms of the number of farm visits and&#13;
farmers meetings held by junior officials, then the informal incentive for&#13;
junior officials is to hold (or at least report) the largest possible number&#13;
of meetings, irrespective of their effectiveness:    though both superior and&#13;
subordinate know that the official aim is to increase acreage of the new&#13;
crop, this need not be their informal priority. Informal priorities will&#13;
seldom be announced, but they are nevertheless effective as pressures on&#13;
subordinates who are concerned with their political future in the organiza-&#13;
tion, or simply to keep in line with the boss.&#13;
Local pressures include all those day-to-day pressures on the&#13;
individual or group stemming not from their superiors, but from the execution&#13;
of their job and their relationship with peers, subordinates and clients.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
For example, an irrigation manager in the field will be subject to pressure&#13;
from peers to cooperate and probably to conform, pressures from farmers&#13;
(complaints, requests for advice), pressures from subordinates, and from the&#13;
many routine administrative matters that de facto take up the majority of his&#13;
time.  He may therefore be subject to four types of influence:    from his own&#13;
career ambitions; the official project implementation line; informal depart-&#13;
mental priorities; and local pressures. Pressures from his superiors,&#13;
reflecting the priorities of superiors and the pressures acting on them in&#13;
turn, may be in conflict with local pressures, e.g., requiring attention to a&#13;
strategic problem, rather than to clearing pressing and immediate tactical&#13;
ones. Local pressures are neglected by evaluators, who, in short visits, and&#13;
with counterpart officials taken off their normal duties to accompany them,&#13;
concentrate on results in the field to the exclusion of getting a picture of&#13;
daily workloads and problems. But the pressures and frustrations of an&#13;
official's daily round inevitably bulk large in the trade-off he must make&#13;
between conflicting pressures from different directions.&#13;
In principle, therefore, the individual or group's behavior may&#13;
be governed by incentive factors quite apart from the dictates of official&#13;
project aims--internal priorities, local pressures, and informal pressures&#13;
from superiors. Project goals will only be pursued: (a) where these are&#13;
not in conflict with more important, i.e., more rewarding factors; (b) where&#13;
project goals are in conflict with other interests, but official pressures&#13;
are so strong that they cannot be ignored; or, (c) most effectively, where&#13;
internal priorities and informal and official pressures coincide as far as&#13;
possible with each other and with project goals. An incentives approach&#13;
suggests that the main aim of project and donor management should be to&#13;
create a situation (c) where there is a minimum conflict between these four&#13;
factors. It follows that determining which are the key interest groups, and&#13;
what are the key incentives and pressures affecting them, must become a major&#13;
goal of organizational appraisal and implementation analysis.&#13;
Case: Incentives in a Complex Project System&#13;
This section illustrates the incentives approach in a brief&#13;
analysis of implementation problems on a major irrigation/settlement scheme&#13;
in South Asia. The project in question was managed on an integrated basis by&#13;
a River Basin Development Board with wide powers, and assistance from major&#13;
aid donors. A number of problems were apparent. Agricultural credit default&#13;
rates were extremely high; equipment offered under project aid loans had not&#13;
arrived; farmers were late in beginning cultivation operations at the start&#13;
of the wet season; essential inputs such as fertilizer arrived late or in&#13;
insufficient quantity; farmers were growing flooded paddy rice on porous soil&#13;
instead of the subsidiary food crops recommended in the project plan; some&#13;
farmers harvesting late had no time to thresh their crop before the land&#13;
preparation period of the subsequent season; perhaps worst of all, irrigation&#13;
water use was double the per acre allocation in the project plan, and hence&#13;
water supply for the tail end of the Scheme still to be irrigated and settled&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
was threatened. In addition, construction work in the latter area was hap-&#13;
hazardly planned, with priority often going to activities off the critical&#13;
path.&#13;
Most of these problems were linked in vicious circles. Farmers&#13;
took longer than planned in land preparation because tractors available under&#13;
the aid loan had not been procured and distributed. This meant that farmers&#13;
kept paddy fields flooded for tillage after the peak period of rains, and&#13;
hence used more irrigation water. Non-arrival of threshers under the aid&#13;
loan meant that crops were often stacked after harvest until buffalo or&#13;
tractor power became available for threshing. This increased grain wastage,&#13;
and delayed the receipt: of cash from the marketed surplus. This often meant&#13;
default on agricultural loans, with the prospect that the use of modern&#13;
inputs in the following season would be reduced.    Delay in harvesting and&#13;
threshing also meant a late start on land preparation in the next season,&#13;
missing the peak period rains and thus continuing the vicious circle.    These&#13;
agricultural problems were, however, no more than symptoms of more fundamen-&#13;
tal planning and management deficiencies. Farmers were hampered by the&#13;
absence of much of the government support designed into the early period of&#13;
implementation.  The Development Board was responsible for prcicring tractors&#13;
and threshers under the aid loan, and had not done so. Annual. inputs were&#13;
arriving late or not at all, again the Board's responsibility.. Planned&#13;
marketing services for the subsidiary food crops had not been organized, so&#13;
that farmers had every incentive to grow their traditional flooded paddy crop&#13;
on the porous soils, and hence vastly increase water consumptloon. Project&#13;
management was in general inadequate.&#13;
In turn, planning and management problems could be l:raced to root&#13;
causes in the area of incentives. The assessment procedure suggests starting&#13;
the examination of incentives at the top, even if it is problems in the field&#13;
which are most apparent. The Chairman of the Board was an able political&#13;
gamesman, who had been promoted to his current position after assuring a&#13;
senior politician that a massive acceleration in the speed of implementation&#13;
of the Scheme was feasible. The politician's personal supporL gave the&#13;
Chairman exceptional power. But his political future now depended on meeting&#13;
targets defined by himself and interested politicians in terms of acres&#13;
irrigated and delivered ready for settlement. His personal incentive was&#13;
therefore to concentrate on construction activity, since the measure of&#13;
progress was acres delivered with irrigation infrastructure, rather than&#13;
agricultural output, etc., in the irrigated areas. This was therefore the&#13;
key divergence in incentive terms between informal and political goals.&#13;
The Chairman was an engineer by profession and this, as commonly&#13;
in irrigation projects, reinforced the bias towards construction. He sur-&#13;
rounded himself with a loyal and effective engineering and construction staff&#13;
in head office, which was clearly the key professional interest group. Sig-&#13;
nificantly, the top managerial post in the area of settlement was filled and&#13;
operated efficiently (perhaps because the arrival of settlers was part of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
measure of progress), while the chief managerial post for agriculture was&#13;
left vacant for over a year--a clear enough indicator of priorities. The&#13;
Chairman and engineering staff controlled the flow of information to the&#13;
Cabinet and overseeing agencies. Reports of progress in the field consis-&#13;
tently highlighted construction activity and downplayed agriculture and&#13;
community development. The priority given to different forms of construction&#13;
work reflected the Chairman's incentives. He concentrated on the building of&#13;
irrigation infrastructure rather than Coop stores essential for community&#13;
development purposes and the provision of agricultural inputs. Within the&#13;
activity of irrigation development, he concentrated on jungle clearance and&#13;
major canal construction rather than on minor canals and field channels. In&#13;
line with the bias in measures of success, it was clear that work was con-&#13;
centrating on activities of high public visibility and concern. What had&#13;
seemed haphazard planning from the perspective of official project goals was&#13;
in fact perfectly rational given the incentives and pressures affecting the&#13;
key interest group in the organization.&#13;
The pattern of incentives developed consistently down the line.&#13;
The acceleration of effort meant that officials were overworked in all sec-&#13;
tors, and therefore that they could not attend to all aspects of their formal&#13;
job descriptions. Given the pressure to obtain bulldozers and other con-&#13;
struction equipment, it was rational for procurement officers in head office&#13;
to concentrate on these at the expense of agricultural equipment. The over-&#13;
worked Project Manager in the field naturally took the line of least resis-&#13;
tance in concentrating on construction rather than agriculture and community&#13;
development work. Personally enthusiastic agriculture officials had no&#13;
support from head office and hence neither incentive nor ability to carry out&#13;
their work according to the project plan. Coop officials responsible for&#13;
procuring agricultural inputs could not plan requirements in advance, since&#13;
they could not predict next season's cultivated acreage on the basis of the&#13;
inflated targets for expansion of the irrigated area given them by the&#13;
engineers. Water bailiffs attempting to reduce water issues faced political&#13;
hostility (including telegrams to the local MP) from top-end farmers who&#13;
stood to lose, and had no incentive to enforce restrictions, given the lack&#13;
of support from top management. All were behaving rationally, but all fail-&#13;
ing by the standards of official project goals.&#13;
The above incentives-oriented sketch of problems and problem causes&#13;
in an integrated rural project illustrates a number of important principles.&#13;
First, the fundamental importance of identifying the divergence between&#13;
official project and informal political goals. Second, the fact that the&#13;
organizational pattern of incentives was determined at a high level in head&#13;
office, far from the resulting problems in the field. This underlines the&#13;
importance of investigating incentives as they operate vertically through the&#13;
hierarchy, and of concentrating on key incentive-setting individuals and&#13;
interest groups. Third, the way in which the key interest group was able to&#13;
pursue its informal goals through control over the setting of organizational&#13;
agendas, and control of information going to overseeing agencies. Fourth,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-&#13;
that while political gamesmanship was evident at higher levels, no conspiracy&#13;
theory or informal politicking is necessary to explain behavior at the level&#13;
of incentive-followers in the field. Field staff could not have given weight&#13;
to all official goals given the work pressures upon them. The informal&#13;
priorities of superiors were translated into pressure for results in certain&#13;
directions which could not be ignored, either in terms of rational&#13;
self-interest or simply in terms of carrying out instructions. In&#13;
general--and most importantly--officials in the implementing organization&#13;
were not planning badly and deviating from official development: goals through&#13;
ignorance or incapacity: they were doing so because of the incentives and&#13;
pressures acting upon them.&#13;
The Practicalities of Assessment:. When, By Whom, and How?&#13;
Previous sections have developed a conceptual approach to assessing&#13;
incentives, and have given a brief illustration of application. The&#13;
remainder of this chapter is concerned with the practicalities of assessment,&#13;
and the need for integration with existing appraisal procedures.&#13;
When:  Although the concern of this paper is with implementation,&#13;
it is clear that the assessment of incentives must primarily take place&#13;
during project preparation. This is because the assessment of political will&#13;
to undertake the project should influence design, and may even raise ques-&#13;
tions as to whether it should go forward at all. It is also because the most&#13;
effective way to influence incentives is to design measures to do so into the&#13;
original project plan (Chapter Five). Systematic attention to assessing&#13;
incentives would therefore require:&#13;
1.   A Reconnaissance Stage Report, assessing the general climate&#13;
of incentive; and pressures in the organization, and recom-&#13;
mending the broad form of project which might be most or&#13;
least appropriate and hence successful.&#13;
2.   A Feasibility-Stage Report:   this should trace throutgh the&#13;
network of activities involved in implementation, stop at&#13;
each critica:L action or assumption (e.g., about coordina-&#13;
tion), and assess whether the incentives exist for&#13;
officials to act as planned.&#13;
3.   Feedback During Implementation:   this is equally important,&#13;
for two reasons. First, it may be hard to fully assess the&#13;
incentive system in the organization at the appraisal stage&#13;
if it is not already undertaking projects closely comparable&#13;
to that proposed. Second, inherent instability in t:he system,&#13;
and the long implementation periods of rural projects, mean&#13;
that'incentives will inevitably change during implementation&#13;
(sponsoring politicians may lose power, key officials may be&#13;
replaced, budgets may be cut, new projects may come up which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
offer greater bureaucratic rewards and hence change priori-&#13;
ties, etc.).&#13;
By Whom: The use of a management or organization development&#13;
specialist for this type of assessment has both good justification and disad-&#13;
vantages. On the positive side, it indicates recognition that management&#13;
is an important subject area in its own right: since management problems are&#13;
as (or more) likely to lead to project failure as any sectoral, technical&#13;
problem, there is as much justification for a management specialist on the&#13;
project appraisal team as there is for a soil scientist or economist.&#13;
Second, it is justified because management as a specialist field requires&#13;
assessment skills different from those of many sectoral experts. And the&#13;
management specialist offers the advantage of organizational "systems vision"&#13;
which does not see problem symptoms through the often distorting glasses of&#13;
sectoral expertise. The disadvantages include the cost of adding yet another&#13;
specialist to the appraisal team, and the fact that management specialists&#13;
with experience of third world bureaucracies and rural development are anyway&#13;
thin on the ground. Also, the management specialist is inevitably fairly&#13;
"high profile." Despite his specialty (or because of the announcement of&#13;
it), he may have more problems in gaining access to the informal management&#13;
system than sector experts who are less suspected of the desire to probe into&#13;
sensitive areas. Presentation as a planning expert may help to minimize the&#13;
third problem.&#13;
Two conclusions may be drawn:&#13;
1.   In general, the management challenges of development are&#13;
still underestimated. In the case of large, integrated&#13;
projects, this should be recognized, and management&#13;
specialists included on appraisal teams as a matter of&#13;
course. Large integrated projects are both the ones&#13;
which can afford the extra professional costs, and the&#13;
ones which imply greatest organizational expansion and&#13;
interagency cooperation, and hence the greatest manage-&#13;
ment problems.&#13;
2.   The costs of appraisal may make a specialist management&#13;
input impractical for smaller projects. The task can&#13;
then either be given to one or more individuals or split&#13;
among all members of a multidisciplinary team, each&#13;
responsible for assessing incentives in his sector.&#13;
The latter method has the advantage of encouraging&#13;
each sector expert to take management factors into&#13;
account when he plans his own aspects of the project:&#13;
the result may be modified proposals at the technical&#13;
level, with a better chance of implementation. On the&#13;
other hand, given that the assessment task needs an&#13;
integrated multisectoral view of the project, it can&#13;
be useful to assign this to team members with this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
overview--for example, an economist or the project&#13;
leader.&#13;
How: The need is to penetrate the formal bureaucracy and to assess&#13;
its informal priorities and processes. The two major practical obstacles&#13;
to this are the questions of access and subjectivity. Senior officials of&#13;
implementing agencies have every incentive to present and stress the excel-&#13;
lence of the formal system in order to secure resources: somehow, access to&#13;
the informal management system must be gained. And once off the security of&#13;
the Organization Chart, the assessor of incentives must often rely on per-&#13;
sonal, subjective judgment about what is significant. Given that appraisal&#13;
time is limited and the ideal approach of participant observation unwelcome,&#13;
there are in practice two major methods of applying the conceptual approach&#13;
outlined above. The first is interviews with field staff, which are likely&#13;
to reveal very different views of organizational resources, goals and&#13;
priorities from those gained from senior officials in head office. The&#13;
second is performance checking to test the consistency of officials' profes-&#13;
sions about priorities with action in the field. What has been done and what&#13;
has been neglected, and the amount of time that has been put into different&#13;
activities will reflect priorities and pressures if the rational bureaucrat&#13;
approach is correct. The evidence of performance will provide valuable&#13;
objective information on how informal pressures from above conflict with&#13;
official ones. Analogous in economics to the idea of "revealed preference",&#13;
this extremely simple approach to evaluating what management has a real&#13;
commitment to has not been available to the project evaluator who has assumed&#13;
that if a non-action is not explicable by a skill or resource gap, then it is&#13;
due to "bureaucratic inertia" or apathy. An approach which works back from&#13;
the concrete evidence of achievement or non-achievement in the field to make&#13;
inferences about motivation and incentives will tend to minimize the problem&#13;
of subjectivity, whose biggest danger is the projection of the evaluator's&#13;
own beliefs and assumptions onto the officials he is interviewing.&#13;
Presenting the Results&#13;
The results of an incentives assessment must be presented so as to&#13;
maximize its usefulness. Full assessments cannot be presented in formal&#13;
project documents, copies of which go to implementing organizations, since&#13;
the procedure will be seen as potentially manipulative and unwelcome. On the&#13;
other hand, the question of incentives cannot be ignored in appraisal docu-&#13;
ments, since one of the best methods of influencing incentives is itself to&#13;
make the implementing agency formally aware that funding agencies care about&#13;
incentives. The following compromises may be suggested for different situa-&#13;
tions:&#13;
1.   Where the pattern of incentives throws real doubt on the&#13;
question of project viability, a full assessment report&#13;
needs to be made in confidence to the funding agency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
2.   Where there are divergences between formal and informal&#13;
priorities, but the project appears viable if incentives&#13;
can be influenced:&#13;
a.   Where the incentive problem is non-threatening, it&#13;
should be dealt with fully in the appraisal document.&#13;
An example would be where incentive problems primarily&#13;
concern junior field staff with little political power,&#13;
i.e., incentive-followers. Inclusion in the project&#13;
document of a clear analysis of the problem and pro-&#13;
posals to counter it is useful, because this formally&#13;
recognizes the incentive system as the root cause,&#13;
and commits the implementing organization to action&#13;
in this area. Since the incentive problems affecting&#13;
field staff that deal directly with farmers are par-&#13;
ticularly important and generally non-threatening,&#13;
assessment of these should be incorporated into agency&#13;
appraisal guidelines as a matter of routine.&#13;
b.   Where incentives assessments are politically threaten-&#13;
ing, drawing attention to them will be counter-&#13;
productive. An example would be the situation in&#13;
the case study above. In such cases, the value of&#13;
assessment would be in designing appropriate measures&#13;
to change incentives, and the inclusion of these&#13;
measures at appropriate points of the project plan.&#13;
In addition, a confidential assessment of the situa-&#13;
tion should be written for the funding agency, first&#13;
so that potential implementation problems can be&#13;
anticipated and watched for: second, so that agency&#13;
officials are aware of the reasons for and importance&#13;
of measures in the plan document primarily aimed at&#13;
influencing incentives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

CHAPTER FIVE&#13;
INFLUENCING INCENTIVES&#13;
Points of Entry&#13;
The very idea of influencing incentives has overtones of manipula-&#13;
tion and conflict. Given that the aim is to minimize conflict that will&#13;
impede implementation, the essential preliminary to considering points of&#13;
entry at the implementation stage is serious consideration of 'points of&#13;
exit" at the planning stage: the use of an incentives assessment to avoid&#13;
investment altogether in projects where real lack of recipient political&#13;
commitment has been detected. However, funding agencies may not welcome the&#13;
frank appraisal of political commitment which this implies. Aid agencies, in&#13;
particular, accepters of gradualist change, have not cared to analyze too&#13;
closely the degree of gradualism they are prepared to accept, the degree of&#13;
compromise they are prepared to make in pursuit of their officLal goals.&#13;
Realistic assessment of those projects which promise to be implementable if&#13;
incentives can be favorably influenced involves facing this question of&#13;
compromise squarely. The need to maintain legitimacy as a foreign agency&#13;
rightly breeds caution about activism on sensitive issues. Such caution is&#13;
quite wrongly likely to result in a negative attitude towards conscious&#13;
attempts to influence incentives in implementing organizations, on the&#13;
grounds that this could be interference of a political nature. It cannot be&#13;
stressed too strongly that it is a non-issue to raise the question whether&#13;
agencies should be involved in the sort of recipient bureaucratic political&#13;
activity described in Chapter Three. It is a non-issue because agencies have&#13;
no choice: they already are involved in the political game. The trickle&#13;
down effect is already diverting resources to the benefit of the bureaucracy&#13;
and the rural rich rather than the rural poor. If funding agencies choose to&#13;
adopt a do-nothing strategy, this is effectively a political decision to&#13;
accept the present position. If agencies are serious about their official&#13;
goals, the question (to paraphrase Sapolsky, p. 17 above) is not whether they&#13;
play politics, but how to be better at it than others. This is the question&#13;
addressed in the remainder of this Chapter.&#13;
There are two broad approaches to influencing incentives, concerned&#13;
respectively with affecting intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic&#13;
motivation--in the language of this paper the internal priorit:ies that shape&#13;
attitudes to work and career--is determined largely by financial rewards and&#13;
the personnel management system. The fact that these are often outside the&#13;
scope of agency influence does not diminish their importance. As Esman and&#13;
Montgomery (1980: 208) point out, field staff should be rewarded for the&#13;
extra effort needed to work with the hardest-to-reach, most marginal farmers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
Changing financial and benefit systems and the creation of national awards&#13;
for success in poverty-reducing projects and programs could do much to make&#13;
the work of agricultural extension or bare-foot doctoring as prestigious and&#13;
rewarding as careers in research or official medicine, and thus have tremen-&#13;
dous effects on performance in the field. At the project level, where direct&#13;
influence over base salaries is seldom possible, funding agencies may never-&#13;
theless be able to influence material incentives in a number of different&#13;
ways. First, it may be possible to increase cash incentives other than&#13;
salaries--for example, field and travel allowances. Second, non-cash&#13;
material incentives such as better transport or housing may also be more open&#13;
to negotiation, and equally effective motivators. Third, promotion, train-&#13;
ing, and the payment of annual bonuses can be linked much more directly to&#13;
performance. Bottrall (1981: 118), in a detailed case study of irrigation&#13;
project management, illustrates clearly the incentive effect of bonuses&#13;
payable to field staff at the discretion of project management--an outcome&#13;
facilitated by the unusual independence of the case project from the govern-&#13;
ment budget, due to revenues collected from farmers in payment for project&#13;
services.&#13;
The second broad approach to influencing incentives is concerned&#13;
with extrinsic motivation, and it is this which has been least systematically&#13;
considered elsewhere. Extrinsic motivation involves influencing the remain-&#13;
ing groups of incentives--official, informal, and local pressures and incen-&#13;
tives. The need is to find ways of reducing counter-productive informal&#13;
political activity without creating unnecessary conflict, and without over-&#13;
stepping the funding agency's bounds of legitimacy. In the following sec-&#13;
tions, it is suggested that two broad points of entry minimize these dangers:&#13;
approaches through planning and control, and approaches through feedback,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. The aim here is not to spell out the detail of&#13;
planning and evaluation techniques whose principles are available elsewhere,&#13;
but to show in particular how they can be used to influence incentives in a&#13;
manner that is as depoliticized and non-threatening as possible. The con-&#13;
siderable scope of such "non-political" methods of entry for creating effec-&#13;
tive change in informal political priorities is discussed, and illustrated&#13;
with a number of examples of success and failure from the field. The final&#13;
section of the Chapter then considers the limitations of such indirect&#13;
influence, and the need to complement this with direct influence through both&#13;
encouragement and pressure.&#13;
Depoliticized Entry: Planning&#13;
Perfectly legitimate influence in the prima facie non-political&#13;
area of planning can have direct impact on the much more obviously political&#13;
area of control. The procedures of better planning can hardly be refused as&#13;
unwelcome by implementing agencies, for they represent merely more efficient&#13;
means of achieving project or program goals agreed to by both funding agency&#13;
and recipient. Yet planning has direct impact on incentives and motivation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
Goal Clarity: Effective goal-setting is the essence of planning.&#13;
No official can be motivated to perform well unless he knows exactly what&#13;
is expected of him. Clear job descriptions appear such basic tools that they&#13;
may be assumed to exist,, while attention goes to the fancier techniques of&#13;
planning. Such job descriptions need not be the detailed exercise developd&#13;
by western personnel managers. The essence is the clear definition of role&#13;
and interactions, as found, for example, in the Training and Visit system of&#13;
extension (see page 53 below). Only if individual roles are clear does a&#13;
subordinate know what he needs to do so satisfy his superiors and win promo-&#13;
tion: only then does a supervisor have an adequate standard by which to&#13;
judge subordinate performance.   Clear job descriptions therefore act as both&#13;
a positive incentive, and as a negative pressure discouraging movement away&#13;
from the official project line.&#13;
The task of writing job descriptions can be difficult, in that it&#13;
involves disaggregating complex program goals into relatively simple "stand-&#13;
ard operating procedures" for individuals. It also usually involves making&#13;
trade-offs between conflicting goals, which are seldom fully resolved, if at&#13;
all, at the project formulation/funding stage. At the allocation stage, it&#13;
is often politically wise to leave goals as all-embracing as possible, so&#13;
that diverse interest groups may see themselves as benefitted, and hence&#13;
support the allocation. (Whether or not this is desirable, it will continue&#13;
to happen.) The task at the implementation stage is to see that choices&#13;
between goals are faced at once, rather than left to be resolved by junior&#13;
officials without sufficient power to counter local pressures. In par-&#13;
ticular, if choices about target groups are not made at this stage, the&#13;
project is more likely to benefit influential interest groups than the poor:&#13;
planning to avoid this outcome is considered further below. Senior manage-&#13;
ment must be involved in the vetting of all job descriptions, since this is&#13;
in fact an important extension of policy-making. This also forces top&#13;
managers to think realistically about the pressures on junior field&#13;
staff whom they may meet rather infrequently. At the general bureaucratic-&#13;
political level, developing clear job descriptions is a way of clearly stat-&#13;
ing official priorities at all levels in the hierarchy, and a way of reducing&#13;
the areas of vagueness which are necessary if managers are to pursue informal&#13;
goals. It is small wonder, therefore, from a political point of view, that&#13;
this important activity tends to be overlooked.&#13;
Realistic Goal-Setting and Participation: It should be possible&#13;
to carry out the job as described. Though this is one of the more obvious&#13;
points to be made about planning workloads, it is almost universally true&#13;
that field staff are so overloaded that they have no hope of carrying out&#13;
their jobs effectively, even if it is clear what they are supposed to do.&#13;
There are two common results. The first is apathy--the feeling that if a&#13;
field worker is supposed to visit an impossible number of farners each day,&#13;
he can never work satisfactorily and might just as well give uip and visit&#13;
no farmers. The second reaction is to focus attention on those elements of&#13;
the job which are either easiest to carry out or which there is most pressure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
to attend to (through local or informal pressures from above), i.e., to&#13;
follow the line of least resistance. Clearly, unrealistic job descriptions&#13;
are likely to result in deviations from official goals. It is, however,&#13;
quite rational for senior managers to design impossible jobs for their&#13;
juniors. Quite often, over-ambitious project or program targets are set by&#13;
politicians and must be at least formally acquiesced to. In situations of&#13;
manpower and budget shortages, this necessarily means stretching field staff&#13;
impossibly thin. Aid donors are often partly to blame for this, in at least&#13;
three ways. First, they are predisposed in favor of bounded-site,&#13;
resource-intensive projects which mop up an unfair share of the best staff&#13;
and reduce availabilities elsewhere. Second, they (and recipient govern-&#13;
ments) are often tempted to expand existing successful projects by widening&#13;
the duties of field staff. Third, development agencies with foreign exchange&#13;
to spend are often insufficiently willing to contribute local, recurrent&#13;
funding for field staff essential to project success.&#13;
Once again, setting realistic goals involves making uncomfortable&#13;
choices about priorities. Donors and consultants here have an opportunity&#13;
to be of political help to top implementing officials, who on their own can&#13;
do nothing to moderate unrealistic targets set by politicians (for example,&#13;
the disincentive effects of the totally unrealistic targets for rice produc-&#13;
tion in Indonesia between 1969 and 1974, set solely by Soeharto and an&#13;
intimate circle of advisers, are considered in Hansen, 1971). Donors can&#13;
legitimately insist on working out reasonable targets in conjunction with the&#13;
implementing officials themselves. This is an activity where participative&#13;
management is essential. The choice of goals may be a policy decision at a&#13;
high level, but the realistic setting of quantitative targets can only be&#13;
done in conjunction with implementing officials who are aware of constraints&#13;
in the field. Such participative planning has the greatest possible incen-&#13;
tive benefits, since officials are likely to be committed to targets that&#13;
they believe to be realistic and have helped set. For this reason, par-&#13;
ticipative goal-setting should be extended to the lowest levels of the&#13;
hierarchy. Bottom-up rather than top-down targetry is not only realistic,&#13;
but essential to motivation. More realistic goal-setting has important&#13;
bureaucratic-political consequences too. Unrealistic targets encourage&#13;
managers to focus on activities which are the most visible or the most&#13;
measured, and general overload provides a smokescreen behind which informal&#13;
goals can be given priority. Goals that are realistic as well as clear make&#13;
deviation from the official line more obvious and less excusable.&#13;
Planning Planning: Given that the sort of basic planning efforts&#13;
described above will constrain informal political activity, they will not&#13;
develop by themselves. It is, however, perfectly legitimate for funding&#13;
agencies to assist in the institutionalization of planning by designing a&#13;
Planning Unit into the structure of larger, integrated projects and programs.&#13;
Its terms of reference need to be carefully drawn, however, if it is not to&#13;
become a center of political conflict. Planning Units must, above all, avoid&#13;
the centralization of detailed planning functions. They should have two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-&#13;
major roles. First, to be available to assist other departments in the&#13;
development of their own planning capability. Second, to aggregate and&#13;
coordinate the various detailed plans from departments into a macro-plan for&#13;
the project or program. This involves checking the realism of departmental&#13;
plans, making sure that such plans are mutually consistent, and where such&#13;
plans involve reliance on other agencies or departments, ensuring that&#13;
appropriate arrangements for coordination have been made. The Planning Unit&#13;
should report only to the program chief or directing board, and should fur-&#13;
nish a realistic macro-plan, or a statement why present departmental plans&#13;
are inadequate or inconsistent. It is then up to top management to instruct&#13;
departments to improve or alter plans, or to make arrangements for coordina-&#13;
tion. Planning Units without executive power are essential if planning is to&#13;
be as far as possible participative, aggregative and bottom-up. Lack of&#13;
executive power minimizes the risk of a Planning Unit being seen as a politi-&#13;
cal threat by departmenl:s concerned with their own autonomy. Institutional-&#13;
ized planning may also appear threatening from the political point of view of&#13;
a chief executive: its introduction during implementation may seem an unwel-&#13;
come restriction of his freedom of action in a personalist bureaucracy.&#13;
Institutionalized planning must therefore be planned into the project at the&#13;
design stage, as one of the quid pro quos of funding, presented as a means by&#13;
which top management can increase its control of implementation activity.&#13;
Planning Coordination:   The cooperation of coordinatSing agencies&#13;
is a key resource requirement for integrated rural projects. Once again,&#13;
coordination is unlikely to be politically rational and practiced unless it&#13;
is specifically planned for. Cooperation must be seen as a plus-sum game.&#13;
All too often, where the achievements of the project go to the credit of the&#13;
"major" implementing agency, cooperation is seen as a zero-sum game, in which&#13;
the coordinating agency loses the resources (physical, staff, time, energy)&#13;
put into the project, for a return which goes to another organization. Coor-&#13;
dinating agencies must be involved in all stages of the planning process, a&#13;
key part of which must be the design of agreed mechanisms for ensuring con-&#13;
tinued coordination. Smith, Lethem and Thoolen (1980: 26) give a useful&#13;
summary of such mechanisms ranging from "weak" to "strong". At the weak end&#13;
of the spectrum, mechanisms include ad hoc meetings to coordinate as pr-oblems&#13;
arise: midway they place measures such as participation in regular planning&#13;
meetings and the development of liaison positions: at the strong end of the&#13;
spectrum, written working agreements, full-time membership in committees,&#13;
development of liaison groups, and participation in matrix structures (i.e.,&#13;
with dual reporting relationships). Regular planning meetings and the&#13;
nomination of liaison officers are likely to be the necessary minimum in&#13;
practice.  The latter is an important means of reducing buck-passing and&#13;
confusion, and should be introduced as a routine measure, since the liaison&#13;
function need not be a full-time job for the individual involved. Members of&#13;
the planning units of each agency are one logical choice for the liaison&#13;
position, given their overall view of project activities, relative political&#13;
independence, and access to top management. With regard to the stronger&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-&#13;
measures put forward, written working agreements are a useful means of focus-&#13;
ing on goals, priorities and the distribution of responsibility, and provide&#13;
an essential reference-point for the future. A number of other mechanisms&#13;
are less desirable, in that coordination has costs as well as benefits: the&#13;
time costs of committee membership and the political costs of attempting to&#13;
form matrix structures, for example, may well be unacceptable. The exception&#13;
is the creation of liaison groups, providing that these consist of members of&#13;
the Evaluation (see page 47) and Planning Units of the respective agencies,&#13;
and are thus a logical extension rather than a duplication of internal plan-&#13;
ning and monitoring efforts. The function of such groups is considered&#13;
further below.&#13;
Planning to Reach the Poor: Like coordination, benefitting the&#13;
rural poor is a special problem in the context of a political bureaucracy.&#13;
As Chapter Three noted, informal incentives at present make it rational for&#13;
field staff to concentrate on larger, richer farmers who are more influential&#13;
and easier to reach and deal with. Specific incentives and pressures must&#13;
therefore be built into the project to make it rational for field staff to&#13;
make efforts to reach the poor. The first essential is simply to specify&#13;
the provision of benefits to poorer groups as a priority goal, if this is the&#13;
official aim of the project. When goals are unclear, and trade-offs have&#13;
not been resolved at the planning stage, field officers will usually be left&#13;
with unranked, multiple goals: for example, in the case of an agricultural&#13;
extension officer, increasing the acreage of a new crop, and raising the&#13;
incomes of the least well off. Such lack of goal clarity is an effective&#13;
incentive to concentrate on the richer rather than the poorer, given informal&#13;
and local pressures. The second essential is again to make sure that targets&#13;
are realistic. Project designers seldom take sufficient account of the&#13;
greater efforts needed to contact and work with poor beneficiaries: elements&#13;
of the project may need to be redesigned during implementation to take&#13;
account of conservative attitudes to risk and innovation: and, even with the&#13;
most appropriate of project designs, the discontinuance rate among poor&#13;
beneficiaries will be higher than average. These and other factors will mean&#13;
that the number of beneficiaries with which one field officer may hope to&#13;
work may need to be reduced, and that slower progress (though in the right&#13;
direction) must be expected and accepted. Only if field staff are set&#13;
realistic goals will they treat poverty reduction as a challenge to be&#13;
accepted rather than avoided.&#13;
Fundamental to this type of clear, realistic goal-setting is the&#13;
identification of the right target group of beneficiaries at the earliest&#13;
possible stage. Political pressure to proceed with implementation and&#13;
produce results often means that this most crucial part of the planning&#13;
exercise is neglected. The ideally planned project will be based on a&#13;
thorough socio-economic survey of existing conditions in the project area, as&#13;
an essential starting-point for designing proposals which take account of&#13;
potential beneficiaries' existing priorities and constraints. Where such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45-&#13;
surveys are not available, and there is pressure to proceed with implementa-&#13;
tion (the majority of projects), quicker-anddirtier methods of target group&#13;
selection can be very effective (see, for example, Chambers, 1978: 11-14 for&#13;
guidelines). These are simple enough to be applied by the village-level&#13;
field staff who, in programs of wide coverage, may have to be responsible for&#13;
the selection of beneficiaries/ contact farmers. Where this is the case,&#13;
the Planning Unit must undertake a sample survey to determine whether such&#13;
guidelines are actually being followed (see, for example, Cernea and Tepping,&#13;
1977: 59). There is every incentive to skimp this part of the planning exer-&#13;
cise, on the part of politicians interested in the support of influential&#13;
rural groups, on the part of top management wanting to proceed visibly with&#13;
implementation, and on t:he part of field workers whose lives will be made&#13;
easier if they can miss the poorest beneficiaries. Funding agencies can help&#13;
here by allocating time and money in the project plan specifically for this&#13;
purpose, by monitoring t:his stage of project activity more carefully than any&#13;
other, and by offering t:echnical assistance if necessary for the development&#13;
of suitable guidelines and survey techniques.&#13;
Planning During Implementation:   A major mental reversal is begin-&#13;
ning to be made away from thinking of planning solely as the fcrmal planning&#13;
exercise before implementation. Equally important is effective on-going&#13;
planning, adaptive to changing goals and constraints during implementation.&#13;
Funding agency assistance in planning still tends to concentrate on the major&#13;
project document needed for the allocation of funds. But it is just as&#13;
legitimate for donors to offer assistance in on-going planning and manage-&#13;
ment. The potential poLitical threat of such assistance may be defused by&#13;
stressing its technical nature, as in the apparently neutral control tech-&#13;
nique of critical path analysis. Critical path analysis requires first the&#13;
definition of the range of activities going to make up the pro;ject: then&#13;
their arrangement into a network, showing sequences and interconnections:&#13;
then the identification of the resource requirements over time for the&#13;
various activities. Critical path analysis therefore implies: (a) having a&#13;
clear idea of project goals; (b) placing importance on the need for coordina-&#13;
tion (through networks stressing the complementarity of activit:ies); and (c)&#13;
defining responsibility for different actions (necessary in the matching of&#13;
human resource requirements and project activities). Such continuous plan-&#13;
ning techniques usefully assist in clarifying official goals al: all levels,&#13;
and reducing the areas of vagueness in which informal goals may be pursued.&#13;
Depoliticized Entry: Feedback&#13;
Management is frequently described as decision-making. This,&#13;
of course, is correct. But the emphasis in such a view is often&#13;
misplaced, focussing almost exclusively on choice. Choice,&#13;
however, is only one step in the decision process. Prior to&#13;
the exercise of choice, information about the environment and&#13;
possible consequences of alternative actions must be acquired&#13;
and processed. Once this is done, the choice is usually&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
obvious. Instead of describing management as decision-making,&#13;
we could describe management as information gathering and be&#13;
both consistent with the original position and possibly more&#13;
descriptive of the actual emphasis of managers (Pfeffer and&#13;
Salancik, 1978: 266).&#13;
Effective monitoring and evaluation complement good planning partly&#13;
through their indirect effects on the reward element necessary to motivation.&#13;
Officials may have clear and realistic goals, but will have little incentive&#13;
to work towards them if what they do is not seen to be done and appreciated.&#13;
But the establishment of better information flows has still wider implica-&#13;
tions for better project management. As Pfeffer and Salancik point out, the&#13;
predisposing nature and function of information flows is not sufficiently&#13;
realized. The job of deciding what is reported is an extremely important and&#13;
responsible one, because it will determine the view of the project held at&#13;
the 'highest political levels. Better reporting systems in effect constantly&#13;
confront the official proposals of the project originators with the informal&#13;
interpretations of them by the executive. If the publicly exposed dis-&#13;
crepancy is too great, it becomes very hard for managers not to take action&#13;
to correct it. Informal management systems can only flourish in areas where&#13;
duties are vague and evaluation and inquiry not too closely pressed. If the&#13;
political level is clear in its priorities, but has been misinterpreted by&#13;
the executive, the political level has for the first time the right informa-&#13;
tion on which to base the right orders to exert corrective influence. If the&#13;
political level is not clear in its commitment to all project goals, its&#13;
position will at least become explicit for the first time.&#13;
Monitoring should therefore have two major goals. The first is to&#13;
provide information about progress without which on-going planning and con-&#13;
trol are not possible (for a thorough analysis of the use of information&#13;
systems for control purposes, see Lawler and Rhode, 1976). This task is&#13;
clearly basic to a view of management seen as an iterative process between&#13;
planning and feedback. The second goal is to motivate managers and field&#13;
staff. The ideal approaches for developing information systems to meet these&#13;
two goals are somewhat in tension. The next two sections therefore discuss&#13;
two major and potentially conflicting approaches, and ways in which these may&#13;
be successfully implemented together.&#13;
"Participative Monitoring": From an incentive standpoint, monitor-&#13;
ing must be seen as much for the benefit of the subordinate as for the supe-&#13;
rior. If realistic goals are set with the cooperation of subordinates, the&#13;
aim should be a monitoring system by which subordinates can themselves&#13;
measure their own progress towards their own mutually agreed goals. But the&#13;
system cannot be solely under the control of field staff, or their incentive&#13;
will instead be to misreport activities, for example by falsifying entries in&#13;
their log of field visits. Systematic checks must therefore be made by&#13;
superiors both to provide negative pressures against misreporting, and to&#13;
provide the positive incentive of recognition of good performance. The need&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-&#13;
is to develop monitoring systems which are objective and honest without the&#13;
heavy (and demoralizing) hand of authoritarian supervision. Four suggestions&#13;
can be made for procedures which will help to make performance checks posi-&#13;
tive rather than negative incentives. First, the bulk of routine monitoring&#13;
should be carried out by field staff's own immediate superiors: the descent&#13;
of specialist M/E staff from head office is hard to present as a supportive&#13;
procedure. Second, superiors should never check performance by calling staff&#13;
in for review, but should do so in the course of routine field visits when&#13;
the superior may observe and participate in his subordinate's work. Perfor-&#13;
mance checking is more objective when carried out in the field. But from an&#13;
incentives standpoint, the key thing is that the superior comes to the subor-&#13;
dinate, takes an interest in his work and problems, and resolves any dif-&#13;
ficulties and gives any advice he can. Performance is thus automatically&#13;
evaluated in the course of discussion of the previous week or two weeks'&#13;
work. Thirdly, peer participation should be built into the monitoring and&#13;
management system. From the incentives standpoint, the institution of&#13;
regular discussions of problems and achievements between a superior and all&#13;
of his field staff in a local area has several positive effects. Sharing&#13;
problems develops a sense of teamwork, and builds commitment. Peer group&#13;
pressure is one of the strongest possible incentives for achieving conformity&#13;
to norms. Providing challenging but realistic performance standards have&#13;
been set in the planning process, this therefore reduces superiors' needs to&#13;
act as controllers rather than consultants. Also, from a management stand-&#13;
point, regular interaction between field officers in direct contact with&#13;
beneficiaries is in its-elf one of the most effective forms of implementation&#13;
problem-solving, and will often be superior in realism and practicality to&#13;
the contributions of superiors and planners in head office. A fourth crucial&#13;
way to strengthen the eEfectiveness of participative monitoring is the invol-&#13;
vement of the beneficiary. Part of the superior's regular fieLd visit should&#13;
be spent in discussion with contact farmers or other beneficiaries, so that&#13;
their satisfactions, dissatisfactions and suggestions for change are clearly&#13;
registered. This emphasizes client orientation in general, and the fact that&#13;
M/E in particular is not for the ultimate benefit of authority in the&#13;
organization, but for the benefit of the farmers, etc., with whom staff are&#13;
working.&#13;
The Planning and Evaluation Unit: While "participative monitoring"&#13;
is the best positive performance incentive, it must be complemented by inde-&#13;
pendent M/E on a sample basis conducted by an outside unit: without this,&#13;
both senior and junior staff may find it in their joint interest to misreport&#13;
progress up the line in their respective departments. This sort of "monitor-&#13;
ing of monitoring" must be carried out by an independent unit not politically&#13;
beholden to the implementing department. Such a unit must have total control&#13;
over the choice of indicators used in reporting, and complete freedom from&#13;
censorship from above. Since the unit's first function is to provide objec-&#13;
tive checks on performance, this supervisory role has the potential for&#13;
conflict with the more participatory monitoring developed with incentives in&#13;
mind. Whether the P and E Unit is seen as authoritarian and heavy-handed or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-&#13;
helpful is a question of management style. As in the case of planning, the&#13;
central monitoring unit must see its function equally as the provision of&#13;
consultancy services for the development of M/E in individual departments, so&#13;
that these may strengthen control of their activities. Again as in the case&#13;
of planning, the central unit must not seek an executive role: its function&#13;
is simply to report to top management, and to aggregate departmental progress&#13;
into a picture of overall program-wide progress. It is in the P &amp; E Unit&#13;
that technical assistance is likely to be of greatest value. Though the&#13;
training function of technical assistance is rightly stressed as of key&#13;
importance, in practice one of the most valuable things that foreign-experts&#13;
do is to act as a channel of communication for junior or field officials who&#13;
often have a very clear picture of problems and suggestions for solutions,&#13;
but who are unheard (or who are constrained from speaking) because superiors'&#13;
informal priorities are elsewhere. The sad fact of life is that many junior&#13;
officials are competent, but are prevented from acting competently. This is&#13;
a major reason for the often-noted fact of technical assistance not "training&#13;
itself out of a job". Sector experts may make their counterparts more tech-&#13;
nically expert, but when they go home may well leave them at their former&#13;
political disadvantage in the organization. Hence the value of non-sectoral&#13;
technical assistance in setting up organization-wide (and hence more durable)&#13;
feedback systems which will allow existing competence to be heard.&#13;
Finally, with both politics and incentives in mind, M/E systems&#13;
must be designed with the cooperation of the managers who will use them, or&#13;
they will fail. As Deboeck and Kinsey point out (1980: 16):&#13;
Managers will undoubtedly argue that unless a monitoring program&#13;
has been approved from within, it is primarily motivated by the&#13;
fact that it can be used as a lever in the form of criticism...&#13;
Working against the monitoring unit doing a good job is the&#13;
project manager's ignorance of what it can do for him. This may&#13;
amount to a fear of the evaluation component of the unit. If&#13;
such a fear exists in the project manager's mind, it will infect&#13;
all the divisions of the project. In these circumstances, the&#13;
monitoring unit can make a very limited contribution to the&#13;
project's progress.&#13;
What Should be Monitored? The information gathered by M/E units on&#13;
rural projects to date has seldom been used effectively. This is generally&#13;
because it has not been both relevant and timely. The need for timeliness&#13;
together with the dictates of "information economics" (often also ignored)&#13;
mean that M/E information must be quickly collected and simply digested (see&#13;
particularly Chambers, 1978, "Rural Poverty-Oriented Monitoring and Evalua-&#13;
tion. Simple is Optimal?"). The purpose here is not to deal in detail with&#13;
the choice of indicators (treated elsewhere) but to note that simplicity--the&#13;
optimal M/E requirement from a managerial standpoint--is also the ideal from&#13;
an incentives standpoint. Present reporting requirements are often not only&#13;
of very little benefit to management, but so lengthy that meeting them is a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-&#13;
significant "local pressure" on field staff, diverting them from actual&#13;
implementation activity. A small number of indicators which are carefully&#13;
chosen to directly reflect essential goals both reinforces the clarity of&#13;
those goals, and gives staff confidence that good performance in pursuit: of&#13;
them will be clearly reflected to top management. At present, what is&#13;
reported may not reflect ultimate goals, and success measures therefore&#13;
reward behavior which may not contribute to ultimate goals. The lack of&#13;
effective performance measures makes existing non-performance-related&#13;
criteria for promotion (often based on education, training and seniority)&#13;
almost inevitable. Technical assistance is likely to be important in the&#13;
choice of M/E indicators, since the difficulty of choosing suitable measures&#13;
varies in proportion to their simplicity. Western consultancy firms are&#13;
gradually becoming more proficient in this area, and their presence can be&#13;
politically effective in that they carry the weight of donor support behind&#13;
them. But just because this political weight guarantees formal acceptance by&#13;
the implementing agency, special care must be taken to develop M/E systems&#13;
with the cooperation and support of implementing managers, if the result is&#13;
to be effective rather t:han symbolic action.&#13;
Some Examples of Failure and Success&#13;
Agrarian Reform in Peru: McClintock (1980) discusses the agrarian&#13;
reform in Peru carried out by the Velasco regime (1968-75), in a case which&#13;
clearly illustrates the incentives consequences of lack of goal clarity. The&#13;
military government was divided on most major policy issues, incLuding that&#13;
of land reform. Political pressure (in the form of peasant invasions) forced&#13;
agreement on the principle of a massive redistribution program, which had by&#13;
1976 affected 35 percent of agricultural land and 24 percent oif farm&#13;
families. Implementation problems arose in the setting up and running of the&#13;
cooperatives that were to take over the redistributed land. These had their&#13;
roots in the often intense conflicts over goal priorities:&#13;
The conflicts within the military leadership about the desirable&#13;
degree of redistribution and the desirable degree of stat,e and/or&#13;
technocratic influence upon the peasantry were evident in the many&#13;
alterations and gaps in the agrarian reform law. Indeed, it is&#13;
difficult to speak of "formulation" of agrarian reform "policy"&#13;
at one time because so many key points of the 1969 Law were&#13;
changed, and so many other critical issues were not discussed&#13;
in the law. (McClintock, 1980: 72).&#13;
As often, policy had tc, be framed vaguely in order to gain the formal support&#13;
of different political interest groups for implementation. Implementing&#13;
officials were left with unclear, conflicting and constantly changing goals.&#13;
As a result, conflict within the military was reflected by a political split&#13;
in the goals of the two (theoretically cooperating) implementing agencies.&#13;
SINAMOS, the official reform organization, was primarily interested in&#13;
redistribution and political participation for the poorest peasants excluded&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-&#13;
from the cooperatives. The Ministry of Agriculture, on the other hand,&#13;
consistent with its technocratic outlook, was more interested in the produc-&#13;
tivity of the cooperatives.&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture officials were concerned that peasants were&#13;
insufficiently educated to cultivate their new holdings effectively, and&#13;
feared a sharp fall in production which would discredit the entire agrarian&#13;
reform program. Their reaction was to insist on official guidance, in the&#13;
form of Ministry managers for each of the cooperatives. Peasants, on the&#13;
other hand, having just escaped from the hands of hacienda-owner patrons,&#13;
were determined not to fall into the hands of new bureaucratic patrons, and&#13;
were not hesitant to exercise their right under the new law to fire managers&#13;
they did not like, often within 24 hours of appointment. Peasants were also&#13;
worried about the future political situation: the fact that a rightward&#13;
swing might reinstate the hacienda-owners, and the fact that a leftward swing&#13;
might mean the management of "their" cooperative as a state-run enterprise&#13;
was a further disincentive to contribute. Significantly, "although this&#13;
limited commitment to hard work and investment in the enterprise was rational&#13;
from the perspective of cooperative members, it was rarely seen in this light&#13;
by ministry officials, who often regarded the peasants as lazy and ignorant."&#13;
Given the extremely weak position of cooperative managers, and the rational&#13;
attitudes of peasants, it was inevitable that cooperative development would&#13;
fail. As would be expected, given the lack of effective pressures or incen-&#13;
tives from superiors, many managers took the line of least resistance in.&#13;
submitting to local pressures. In some cases, this meant resignation to&#13;
impotence in preference to being fired: in others, this meant cooptation or&#13;
corruption by richer peasants--an outcome encouraged by managers' small&#13;
official incomes.&#13;
Cooperatives in Zambia: In the Peruvian case, political disunity&#13;
and goal conflict were so great that implementation failure was inevitable.&#13;
Quick (1980) discusses the case of cooperative development in Zambia under&#13;
a relatively united political leadership: a case in which the introduction&#13;
of an effective M/E system could perhaps have led to a clearer definition&#13;
of goals and more effective performance.&#13;
No clear statement was ever provided by Kaunda as to&#13;
precisely what the immediate goals of cooperative policy were&#13;
to be, and yet it was made abundantly clear in a variety of&#13;
public speeches made by the president that the cooperatives&#13;
were supposed to do a great deal and do it very quickly.&#13;
During the early months of 1965, the president spoke frequently&#13;
about the cooperative movement, and in these speeches he&#13;
articulated no fewer than ten specific goals that he expected&#13;
the movement to achieve in the next few years. The cooperatives&#13;
were expected to provide employment and stem the flow of&#13;
population to the towns, increase the income of members,&#13;
promote equality in the distribution of income, create&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51--&#13;
collective goods for the rural population, preserve the&#13;
traditional values of the village community, increase&#13;
political participation, strengthen procedures for the&#13;
democratic control of elites, promote a sense of national&#13;
identity, increase and diversify agricultural output, and&#13;
develop a spirit of self-reliance in the local population.&#13;
(Quick, 1980: 46).&#13;
In this situation, cooperative department officials knew they had&#13;
only one unambiguous goal: to create as many cooperatives as possible, fast.&#13;
Since the number of new coop registrations was the visible symbol of progress&#13;
reported to the president, officials had every incentive to enroll prospec-&#13;
tive cooperatives without checking members' experience and suitability, and&#13;
consciously did so. Since the cooperative movement was a political priority,&#13;
a large budget was available to the department, and the next unambiguous&#13;
measure of activity became the granting of coop loans, statistizs for which&#13;
were politically impressive and easily produced. Officials therefore quite&#13;
rationally granted seasonal and long term loans in large quantities, wit:h no&#13;
supervision of the use to which these loans were put.&#13;
The interesting feature of this case is that although field staff&#13;
had no official M/E requirements (and were not even required to visit "their"&#13;
societies regularly), they became so concerned about waste that they sent&#13;
regular reports of inefficiencies and problems back to head office, and&#13;
actually requested closer supervision and a temporary moratorium on new&#13;
registrations. There was no response from the department director until the&#13;
spring of 1967, when the threat of a staff revolt forced him to halt&#13;
registrations. Quick puts forward a number of (politically rational) causes&#13;
of head office unresponsiveness. Kaunda had placed a politician in charge&#13;
of the agency because of his distrust of the bureaucracy, and this&#13;
politician, given the president's constant criticisms of caution in&#13;
bureaucratic implementat:ion, had no incentive to annoy his patron by con-&#13;
centrating on inefficiencies at the cost of expansion. In effect:&#13;
The feedback of field staff was directed at goals that the&#13;
department had not yet defined to be of central importance.&#13;
The field staff was concerned about the inefficiency of the&#13;
economic performance of local societies, and although this&#13;
was a part of the formal goal structure of the agency, it was&#13;
not a part of its operational goal structure. (Quick, 1980: 54)&#13;
The lack of any outside criticism of departmental activities further&#13;
facilitated the pursuit of informal priorities:&#13;
In the case of the Department of Agriculture, a direct rival of&#13;
the Department of Cooperatives for funds and prestige, bureaucratic&#13;
jealousy resulted in a conscious withholding of critical informa-&#13;
tion on cooperatives. The agriculture field staff was discouraged&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52-&#13;
from reporting problems with cooperatives to the Department of&#13;
Cooperatives so that the Department of Agriculture could slowly&#13;
build up a case for the abolition of the whole cooperative movement.&#13;
There was no effective external criticism of the department until&#13;
after 1967, when a critical report by Rene Dumont coincided with a budget&#13;
crisis, and provided the incentive for a radical review of expenditure. The&#13;
resulting national productivity drive was an effective goal clarification for&#13;
the department, and resulted in an immediate effort to improve M/E.&#13;
Implementation subsequently became more efficient and effective, but the&#13;
cooperative movement was never rescued: it was too late to attract back&#13;
demoralized farmers (often the most skilled) who had earlier left the move-&#13;
ment, and at the same time political support dwindled, as politicians con-&#13;
cluded that the program was a failure best abandoned. The case clearly&#13;
demonstrates the importance of assessing before implementation whether&#13;
political goals are effectively developmental or symbolic, and the need to&#13;
design planning and feedback mechanisms into the initial program plan if&#13;
there is to be any hope of creating a climate of incentives favorable to&#13;
project success.&#13;
Rural Development in Malaysia: Esman (1972) discusses the interna-&#13;
tionally celebrated "Redbook and Operations Room" system of project monitor-&#13;
ing developed through the 1950s and 1960s in Malaysia. The system was the&#13;
child of the dynamic Prime Minister, whose influence and commitment to&#13;
development ensured its continued political feasibility. The system had two&#13;
major incentive elements. First, the establishment of monitoring units at&#13;
all levels of government, federal, state and district. Planning and monitor-&#13;
ing techniques centered on charting the progress of projects in red books and&#13;
in visual displays, so that progress and lags in implementation could be seen&#13;
at a glance by monitoring staff and senior visiting officials. Feedback was&#13;
thus readily available, and provided the strongest possible performance&#13;
incentive down the line. Second, the minister himself backed this formal&#13;
system up with encouragement and rigorous checks which made it consistently&#13;
clear to implementing officials that formal goals were the de facto political&#13;
priority. His surprise visits to outlying operations rooms and to project&#13;
sites to check progress against claimed results often resulted in&#13;
well-publicized personal interventions, such as punishments for officials&#13;
misrepresenting progress and promotion for the successful.&#13;
The system's results in the field made it an internationally known&#13;
success. Esman further documents, however, the way in which the system&#13;
subsequently froze and lost its adaptability as officials became convinced&#13;
of its perfection. The system was aimed almost entirely at certain types of&#13;
minor rural construction projects and amenities, such as mosques, wells and&#13;
community halls which, however, did not always meet the production and wel-&#13;
fare needs of potential beneficiaries. The process of development came to be&#13;
seen as the monitoring of progress on this limited variety of projects, and&#13;
spending the "development" budget on schedule. The system had many of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-&#13;
virtues of the "planning unit" approach, without the necessary complement&#13;
of participative monitoring. As a result, it lacked the responsiveness to&#13;
local needs implied in the balanced control-and-feedback approach to manage-&#13;
ment. Ultimately, M/E became an end in itself, with its own vested interest&#13;
in survival unchanged.   As a senior officer claimed:   "The operations room is&#13;
perfect, it is some of the people--the officers, politicians, farmers, who&#13;
are at fault."&#13;
The Training and Visit System of Extension: The successful Train-&#13;
ing and Visit (T and V) System of Agricultural Extension (Benor and Harrison,&#13;
1977) illustrates the incentives effects of planning, monitoring and evalua-&#13;
tion at the more detailed procedural level.   Some of the features of the&#13;
system which provide mutually reinforcing positive incentives are considered&#13;
below:&#13;
Clear and realistic goals:&#13;
1.   Administrative control of the VEW (Village Extension Worker)&#13;
and other field staff is handled solely by the agricu:Lture&#13;
department. VEWs are concerned only with extension, and no&#13;
other developmental activity.&#13;
2.   There is concentration of effort on the few most impoctant&#13;
crops in the local area. For these few crops, there is&#13;
concentration on the few practices which bring the best&#13;
economic results.&#13;
3.   Each VEW attends a weekly or fortnightly training session&#13;
which is devoted almost entirely to the agricultural&#13;
operations and problems faced by farmers in the next week&#13;
or fortnight. VEWs can therefore be confident that their&#13;
advice will be relevant and timely, and they are not&#13;
overburdened with more information than they can absorb&#13;
and communicate effectively.&#13;
4.   The entire extension organization is built up on the&#13;
basis of the number of farmers that one VEW can handle&#13;
under local conditions, and the number of VEWs an&#13;
Extension Officer (AEO) can handle (usually not more&#13;
than eight). This ensures realism in extension workers'&#13;
goals, and is expressive of the system's bottom-up&#13;
planning orientation.&#13;
Coordination:&#13;
5.   Representatives from coordinating input supply, etc.,&#13;
agencies attend VEW training sessions on a regular basis.&#13;
This both builds their understanding of the system (and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-&#13;
hence the effectiveness of their planning), and provides&#13;
a regular opportunity for extension staff to report and&#13;
resolve problems in their areas.&#13;
Monitoring and evaluation:&#13;
6.   Monitoring of progress is carried out by AEOs in the course&#13;
of visits to field sessions in which they will participate.&#13;
VEWs' field logs are inspected and signed, and progress and&#13;
problems discussed. The VEW's diary shows the names of&#13;
attending farmers, practices taught, and problems encountered.&#13;
7.   The self-evaluation built into the system is complemented by&#13;
regular monitoring by superiors. Given the realistic nature&#13;
of goals, monitoring "is relatively simple: farmers can&#13;
be asked if they know the name of their VEW, the day of&#13;
his visit, and three or four of the recommendations made&#13;
that fortnight or even during the whole season. If the&#13;
farmers know these and results can also be seen in the&#13;
fields, then the extension personnel are doing their&#13;
main job."&#13;
Adaptability/Responsiveness:&#13;
8.   The fact that training is carried out each week or fortnight&#13;
means that VEWs can report and get advice on farmers' problems&#13;
immediately. It also means that the latest research findings&#13;
can be disseminated straight away.&#13;
9.   Regular training sessions in groups give VEWs the opportunity&#13;
to discuss and resolve among each other common problems&#13;
encountered with farmers.&#13;
The interaction of detailed procedures for planning, control and&#13;
feedback has produced effective incentives for farmers and field staff and&#13;
impressive results in implementation. The system combines clear and realis-&#13;
tic goal-setting, close supervision, and a broad framework of "standard&#13;
operating procedures" with built-in "organic" planning and feedback&#13;
mechanisms that emphasize adaptability to client requirements. Speed in&#13;
communication, upwards, downwards and sideways, is a key feature of the&#13;
system, made possible by the regular training sessions, and limited VEW&#13;
goals. Concentrating on realistic priority goals and a small number of&#13;
contact farmers has meant visible changes in cultivation techniques after&#13;
only a few months of operation, leading to the spontaneous spread of new&#13;
practices.&#13;
Settlement in South Asia: The case project described in Chapter&#13;
Four illustrates the rise and fall of a Planning and Evaluation Unit. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55-&#13;
original project design included such a unit in the head office of the&#13;
Development Board, with funding under the aid loan for a foreign Implementa-&#13;
tion Adviser to work directly with the Chairman. The Chairman carefully&#13;
defined the Unit's role as that of a non-executive mirror of progress,&#13;
reporting solely to him. The Unit began its work by developing a monitoring&#13;
system for construction progress in the field, which it displayed in visual&#13;
form on map-folders of the project area, redrawn monthly and circulated to&#13;
senior staff. For the first time, managers had a coherent picture of what&#13;
was happening in the field, and the Chairman welcomed this additional tool&#13;
for control, and asked the Unit to extend its activities to a full critical&#13;
path analysis of the 100,000 acres of the Scheme currently in development.&#13;
As the monitoring system for construction progress became an operationaL&#13;
routine, the Unit turned its attention to progress in the agricultural and&#13;
community development sectors, and began to include rough proxy indicators&#13;
for these in the monthly reports. These quickly began to show the imbalances&#13;
in development. The absence of any significant acreage under the subsidiary&#13;
food crops was a pointer to the vicious circle of marketing, water management&#13;
and other problems. The very slow progress in the construction of&#13;
multi-purpose cooperative stores--used as a rough proxy for attention to&#13;
agricultural and community development matters--was also evident.&#13;
After three or four months of routine operation, the existence of&#13;
the progress reports became more widely known, and politicians and&#13;
Cabinet-level officials asked for copies. For the first time, uncensored&#13;
information began to feed back to levels above the Development Board. The&#13;
map form of presentation made it easy to compare progress month by month,&#13;
and a rough extrapolation of current progress strengthened growing doubts&#13;
about the Chairman's ability to meet his promised targets. From this point,&#13;
the Chairman's attitude to the Unit became ambivalent. Previously, its&#13;
feedback had come to him alone, and strengthened his control over the con-&#13;
struction operation. Now the mirror was beginning to reflect the Board's&#13;
implementation weaknesses as well as its strengths to higher authority.&#13;
Ambivalence turned to hostility as a result of two specific developments.&#13;
First, a senior politician asked the P and E Unit directly for a forecast of&#13;
progress over the next six months. The Unit's planning work was now suffi-&#13;
ciently far advanced for it to give rough optimistic and pessimistic&#13;
forecasts which clearly indicated that targets were unattainable. Second, a&#13;
routine donor agency review mission was taken on a tour of the project area&#13;
by Unit staff, at the Clhairman's request. The tour comprised a. fair sample&#13;
of project activity, and alerted donors to some of the imbalances in develop-&#13;
ment, and the poor quality of some irrigation construction work. The Chair-&#13;
man now saw the P and E Unit as a direct threat to his control, and reacted&#13;
swiftly. On the grounds that the Unit's "disclosures" to the donor had been&#13;
a personal embarassment to him, he had the P and E Unit manager transferred.&#13;
In an outward show of response to the donor's requests to develop more&#13;
balanced implementation based on "better" planning, the Chairman, suggested&#13;
that the Implementation Adviser move to a small office directly off the&#13;
Chairman's so as to have his personal ear.   The adviser rightly saw this as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-56-&#13;
move instead to keep him under the Chairman's eye, and to remove him from the&#13;
mainstream of information in the P and E Unit. He declined to move.&#13;
Finally, the Chairman replaced the P and E manager with a loyal engineer from&#13;
his own staff. Somewhat symbolically, the direct connecting-door between the&#13;
Chairman's office and the P and E Unit was for the first time unlocked.&#13;
The Essential Complement: Reinforcing Political Commitment&#13;
Planning and feedback techniques have tremendous under-exploited&#13;
scope for reducing counter-productive informal political activity, and making&#13;
official goals the rational ones to pursue. One value of such techniques is&#13;
that they are presentable as technical help rather than political interven-&#13;
tion, and therefore allow influence with a minimum of conflict. Their&#13;
depoliticized nature is, however, their potential weakness as well as their&#13;
strength (as the last case example shows), in that their institution and&#13;
success rest ultimately on the political sanction of top management. The&#13;
examples in the previous section illustrate clearly the importance of politi-&#13;
cal commitment as the necessary precondition of incentives-oriented planning&#13;
and feedback. In the Peruvian case, political support only really coalesced&#13;
around the somewhat negative goal of defusing the political threat of peasant&#13;
invasions. There was never agreement about positive policies for improving&#13;
peasant welfare beyond redistribution, and hence the prospects of implementa-&#13;
tion of any coherent plan were small. In the Zambian case, support for&#13;
cooperative development seems to have been commitment more to a political&#13;
idea or symbol than to a serious development effort. The Malaysian case&#13;
illustrates the positive effects of clear goals and clearly expressed politi-&#13;
cal support. Part of the success of the "red book" system was due undoub-&#13;
tedly to the monitoring techniques employed. But the incentive to apply&#13;
these techniques rigorously was supplied by the constant encouragement and&#13;
pressure of the Deputy Prime Minister. As a former civil servant, he clearly&#13;
understood that formal support at the time of institution of a new plan was&#13;
not enough: and that it was necessary to follow this up with constant proof&#13;
throughout the implementation process that officially declared goals were&#13;
consistently the actual political priority. The South Asian settlement&#13;
project case illustrates the potential weakness of the planning/feedback&#13;
approach. To be successful as management and incentives tools, Planning and&#13;
Evaluation Units must be non-executive and hence, on their own, politically&#13;
weak. Their viability is therefore totally dependent on the political sup-&#13;
port of top management. If planning and feedback techniques come to be seen&#13;
as a threat, they can no longer successfully be presented as non-political,&#13;
and will only be acceptable in a watered-down and unobtrusive form which will&#13;
marginally affect project performance. The fundamental criticism of the&#13;
"procedural" approach to the management of rural programs, such as that&#13;
developed most fully and effectively by Chambers and Belshaw in Kenya, is&#13;
the assumption that top management will see it as profitable to use the new&#13;
procedures in a positive fashion. If they do not, reasons can always be&#13;
found why they are too cumbersome and impractical to use at all, or they will&#13;
be used partially and hence (by official criteria) ineffectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-57-&#13;
Some significant conclusions for funding agencies can. be drawn.&#13;
Since the scope for agency intervention in the field of management and&#13;
motivation is anyway limited--for example, the chances of significantly&#13;
altering the personnel management and reward system are often nil--the agency&#13;
must operate forcefully and effectively in those areas where it. has&#13;
legitimate access and influence. Yet "technical" help in the field of plan-&#13;
ning, monitoring and evaluation can often be circumvented if it is politi-&#13;
cally unwelcome.   The agency can only counter this by facing the political&#13;
question directly, and attempting to influence the attitudes and priorities&#13;
of managers at the top. There are both positive and negative approaches.&#13;
Encouragement: Funding agencies could "sell" official goals to&#13;
project managements much more forcefully than is the case at present.    If&#13;
agencies really believe in their priorities, they could be much clearer in&#13;
the definition of the type of policy they support, and could institute more&#13;
frequent reviews at the highest level of progress in their programs.    In the&#13;
case of very large integrated programs or projects, it should be possible for&#13;
high-level representatives of the funding agency to meet with the recipient&#13;
project director and his minister on a regular basis to review progress and&#13;
problems. To the extent that budget/donor agency and politicanl begin to&#13;
demonstrate a cooperative commitment to improvement, senior project manage-&#13;
ment would begin to get the message that the official line is t:he real&#13;
priority--and hence have every incentive, if they value their own advance-&#13;
ment, to bring their informal priorities into line with official goals.&#13;
Though the official line could be much more energetically sold by funding&#13;
agencies at all levels (and especially in the field), it is at the highest&#13;
(and most sensitive) levels that the effort must be concentrated if it is to&#13;
be effective.&#13;
This principle could be followed in practice by using the results&#13;
of incentives assessments and political analysis of bureaucracy to anticipate&#13;
problems in particular areas. An incentives assessment at the project&#13;
appraisal stage should indicate those points where official and informal&#13;
goals are most likely to diverge and commitment to be lost. These are points&#13;
on which project review should concentrate. Such problem areas may reflect&#13;
incentives and pressures affecting groups and individuals that are peculiar&#13;
to the project--such as the informal pressures on the Chairman in the settle-&#13;
ment project case. But there are also problem areas, given the common incen-&#13;
tives towards departmental autonomy and growth and the bureaucratic "coali-&#13;
tion of indifference", which are likely to arise in all development projects:&#13;
the special problems of coordination and reaching the poorest, for example.&#13;
If funding agencies stress from the start that these are priorities, and&#13;
constantly reiterate their priority, implementing organizations will have&#13;
more incentive to follow suit. The presentation of a strong official line at&#13;
the outset of a program is the best means of avoiding conflict later, when&#13;
ceding to external agency pressure to revert to formal project goals may&#13;
involve loss of face on the part of project management--again as in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-58-&#13;
settlement project case. Funding agencies must show at the outset and con-&#13;
stantly throughout implementation that they are more than symbolically com-&#13;
mitted to their goals.&#13;
Pressure: In those frequent cases where the priorities of both&#13;
politicians and incentive-setting civil servants are influenced in some&#13;
degree by an informal coalition of indifference to the rural poor, the&#13;
limitations of a positive approach used on its own are clear. Agencies must&#13;
apply carrot and stick--encouragement and pressure. It is commonly argued&#13;
that the power of funding agencies is extremely limited because it rests&#13;
primarily on the all-or-nothing sanction of withdrawing financial support--an&#13;
extreme measure which agencies are naturally reluctant to employ. Neverthe-&#13;
less, there is a great deal of unexploited scope in the possibilities of&#13;
conditionality. At the project level, this should mean more sequential&#13;
development, with funding first of a pilot project and then of successive&#13;
stages or phases of the full scheme, conditional on performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-59-&#13;
CHAPTER SIX&#13;
THE MINIMUM RESPONSE&#13;
It has been argued that avoidance of the management issue is in&#13;
itself an effectively po:litical decision, and hence that funding agency&#13;
involvement in the politLcs of implementation, consciously or unconsciously,&#13;
is inevitable. The question confronted in this final chapter is what degree&#13;
of involvement is really necessary. Third world politicians and managers&#13;
will rightly argue that foreign agency influence in particular should be kept&#13;
to a minimum: nevertheless, this minimum must be defined by the duties of&#13;
the banker as well as the preferences of the recipient. In addition, there&#13;
is a particular moral ob'Ligation implicit in the supervision of funds whose&#13;
opportunity cost may wel:L be measured in terms of malnutrition and disease.&#13;
This chapter argues that the adoption of a systematic politics-incentives&#13;
approach is the minimum realistic response to increasing inequality, and&#13;
political environments that are not supportive of poverty-oriented develop-&#13;
ment. Though its argument is primarily directed to the foreign development&#13;
agencies, most of its implications apply also to funding agencies in the&#13;
Third World.&#13;
Unequal Development&#13;
As is now well known, high GNP growth rates -- and even high&#13;
agricultural growth rate, -- in the developing'world do not necessarily imply&#13;
a better standard of livLng for the rural poor. The green revolution has&#13;
tended to benefit specifLc regions and specific crops only. For example, in&#13;
India between 1957 and 1973, the average agricultural growth rate per head&#13;
was 3.16 percent per annum in the wheat-growing Punjab/Haryana region, and&#13;
only 0.79 percent per annum in West Bengal and 1.01 percent per annum in&#13;
Tamil Nadu -- both rice-producing regions (Griffin and Ghose, 1979). Even&#13;
within the faster-growing regions, there is evidence that the new technology&#13;
has benefitted the larger farmers most. Most disturbing of all (Griffin and&#13;
Ghose, op. cit.) is that not only has relative inequality been increasing,&#13;
but that the poor in many rural areas have actually been getting poorer in&#13;
absolute terms. From the broadest macro perspective, therefore, the record&#13;
to date is not an encouraging one. Formal policy decisions that: aid must&#13;
directly benefit the poorest groups have been extremely difficult to carry&#13;
out (just as poverty-aimed programs in developed countries such as the USA&#13;
have been notably unsuccessful). The problem is that the poor can be neatly&#13;
defined in economists' statistical tables as some homogenous lower fractile&#13;
of the population in income per head terms, but in the rural are!as the poor&#13;
live next to, are the tenants of, owe money to and work for the relatively&#13;
prosperous larger land-holder. Leakage of benefits to non-target groups in&#13;
these circumstances is inevitable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-60-&#13;
There is a growing awareness as to which types of rural development&#13;
projects have been, by and large, successful, and which not. Generally&#13;
speaking, marketable-crop-based projects have been the most successful, in&#13;
particular those for mono-cropped export commodities such as palm oil, sugar,&#13;
coffee, rubber, etc. The least successful projects have been those aimed at&#13;
improving the living standards of farmers in rainfed areas with a tradition&#13;
of subsistence cropping or pastoralism. This is extremely significant, since&#13;
it is in just these areas that the world's 'rural poor are concentrated.&#13;
There is also evidence that the large-scale, integrated area project that has&#13;
been the trademark of the 1970s is too resource-intensive to be generally&#13;
replicable. This is becoming more obvious as we look back at the special&#13;
ingredients of some of the rural development projects that have been held up&#13;
as the models of the 1970s. In Latin America, the Vicos project in Peru,&#13;
which successfully transformed a hacienda into a flourishing farming com-&#13;
munity run by the former workers, was recognized in evaluation as depending&#13;
on a concentration of technical assistance that could not be repeated on a&#13;
wide scale. In China, the Dachai project has been evaluated in similar&#13;
terms, as being heavily dependent on moral and technical support from outside&#13;
in quantities that could not be made available to the average "non-showpiece"&#13;
village. The problems of the showpiece project are clearly summarized in an&#13;
evaluation of the famous Comilla Cooperative System (Khan, 1979) whose con-&#13;
clusions might apply rather widely to integrated projects elsewhere:&#13;
The basis of the program was a massive concentration, by&#13;
Bangladesh standards, of modern inputs (e.g., pumps, tubewells,&#13;
tractors, improved seed, fertilizer, pesticide and training)&#13;
which were very heavily subsidized. Above all the presence of&#13;
the Bangladesh Academy of Rural Development and its remarkable&#13;
leader, Akter Hamid Khan, ensured the availability of a par-&#13;
ticularly unique resource for the implementation of the program...&#13;
Output per acre increased rapidly for the crops incorporating&#13;
the HYV technique. But this gain seems to have owed little to the&#13;
cooperative organization itself. The credit is more appropriately&#13;
due to the concentration of resources made available by the&#13;
government. Indeed, the cooperative members seem to have lagged&#13;
a little behind the non-members in terms of growth in production&#13;
per acre.&#13;
The management of the cooperatives was dominated by farmers&#13;
who, by Comilla standards, were large. The benefits were largely&#13;
concentrated in the hands of the rich and powerful. The "medium"&#13;
farmers also appear to have made some gains. But relatively&#13;
little gain accrued to the small peasants and none directly to&#13;
the landless. The naive view that benefits would trickle down&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-61-&#13;
to the poorest does not seem to have been correct. Landlessness&#13;
and land concentration increased.&#13;
Corroborative evidence that the large integrated project, favorite&#13;
of the aid agencies, is in fact relatively unsuccessful is provided by an&#13;
evaluation by Development Alternatives, Inc., of 36 rural development&#13;
projects funded by the USAID (DAI, 1975). According to their success&#13;
criteria, which included measures of the prospects for self-sustaining&#13;
growth, projects receiving over a million dollars in grants or loans from&#13;
foreign public donors in the first few years of operation were significantly&#13;
less effective than other projects. The key factors in project success were&#13;
found to be the degree of local participation and action, specifically the&#13;
involvement of the small farmer in decision-making during the implementation&#13;
phase, and the existence of a substantial resource commitment (money, labor)&#13;
by the farmer. It is highly significant that it is just these factors --&#13;
participation and commitment -- which are least likely to be fostered by the&#13;
type of bureaucracy analyzed in this paper. Evidence from these studies&#13;
strongly suggests that the element of motivation is a key one, and that if&#13;
this is present, other unfavorable factors can be overcome:&#13;
Somewhat surprisingly, greater project success appeared to occur&#13;
in projects located a considerable distance from all-weather&#13;
roads and in project:s where the literacy rates of participants&#13;
were low. We believe that this is a reflection of a deliberate&#13;
decision by leaders of some of the most successful projects in&#13;
the sample to work in remote areas and not the influence of the&#13;
two factors as such.&#13;
The importance of a motivated leadership and its key role in securing commit-&#13;
ment from farmers parallels the situation in the Dachai and Comilla projects.&#13;
The suggestion has been t:hat those projects and programs which have been&#13;
successful are too resource-intensive to be widely replicated. The theme of&#13;
this paper -- that motivation, commitment and leadership are the key to rural&#13;
development -- seems to be supported by evidence from the field that these&#13;
are the scarce and limit:Lng resources.  If this is so, then greater attention&#13;
to management and incentives is a requirement of success.&#13;
Operating at the Margin Ln a Hostile Environment&#13;
Success and failure in rural development to date must finally be&#13;
seen in the context of the political economies of Third World nations. These&#13;
are marked by high concentrations of wealth, power, and access t:o resources.&#13;
Especially in the aid agencies, where the day-to-day preoccupat:ion is with&#13;
"the program" and the success of individual projects undertaken, it is all&#13;
too easy to forget this overall context of rural development: t:he fact that&#13;
development work aimed at the rural poor is mere "operation at t:he margin" of&#13;
these distorted economies and unequal societies. The idea of "operation at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-62-&#13;
the margin" was clearly expressed (and advocated) in 1974 in Redistribution&#13;
With Growth (Chenery, 1974), as follows:&#13;
Conservative liberal strategies tend to focus almost&#13;
entirely on market price corrections designed to&#13;
"get the prices right" in the hope that the economic&#13;
structure is sufficiently flexible and the conviction&#13;
that everyone will benefit. By contrast, the radical&#13;
solution places heavy emphasis upon breaking the con-&#13;
centration of wealth and the institutional framework&#13;
which both reflects and supports this concentration.&#13;
In advocating an eclectic approach, we recognize&#13;
that the conservative liberal solutions may not be&#13;
sufficient. Some action toward redressing the extreme&#13;
concentration of physical assets (in terms of ownership&#13;
control and access) is also necessary, and government&#13;
can act on this front by redirecting the flow of&#13;
public investment over time. By operating at the&#13;
margin, governments may be able to alter the patterns&#13;
of concentrations significantly, to an extent that may&#13;
be politically impossible by operating on the stock&#13;
of existing assets alone. The ultimate justification&#13;
for eclecticism is not that it is always right but that&#13;
it is most likely to be politically feasible.&#13;
The ideas summarized in this quotation have been the effective basis of World&#13;
Bank and other aid agency development policy during the 1970s. "Redirecting&#13;
the flow of public investment over time" has taken the form of rural projects&#13;
and programs which reallocate resources so as to counter existing distortions&#13;
in the economy, using cost-benefit analysis and shadow pricing -- broader&#13;
attempts to alter financial market prices or the distribution of land being&#13;
often politically difficult. The argument throughout this paper has been&#13;
that politics affects not only plans and policy but also the implementation&#13;
process. The "Redistribution With Growth" philosophy must therefore pass the&#13;
test of surviving the implementation process without undergoing, due to&#13;
political pressures, what has been called "mutation" so as to profit groups&#13;
other than the intended beneficiaries. The danger with the "eclectic&#13;
approach" is that its admitted compromise with vested interests (political&#13;
feasibility) at the level of policy-making is followed by mutation at the&#13;
implementation stage, and hence failure.&#13;
The process of mutation has been documented by John Woodward Thomas&#13;
(1974) in a study of the political dimensions of public works programs in a&#13;
number of developing countries. Two of his conclusions are quoted here for&#13;
the contrast they represent to the more common assumption that operating at&#13;
the margin by means of redirecting public investment is a politically&#13;
feasible means of benefitting the rural poor:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-63-&#13;
(1) The first major factor influencing the outcome of a&#13;
public works program is the level and strength of&#13;
commitment to enforcing the program's reform objec-&#13;
tives.... Over a period of time, these run counter&#13;
to the existing distribution of economic and political&#13;
power at the local level....   If the regime is too&#13;
dependent on local support to be able to reinforce&#13;
its original objective and to run the risk of alienating&#13;
a significant proportion of its supporting coalition,&#13;
mutation will take place....&#13;
(2) The distribution of economic assets and political&#13;
power at the level at which the public works program&#13;
is implemented is a second major factor influencing&#13;
the outcome. The more equal the distribution of&#13;
resources, particularly of land, the more likely it&#13;
is that all members of the community will share an&#13;
interest in assuring the project's success. Con-&#13;
versely, a highly skewed distribution of relevant&#13;
assets and articulate special interest groups at the&#13;
local level usually lead to strong forces to mutate&#13;
the program in the interests of non-target groups.&#13;
Thomas therefore suggests that "politically feasible" operations at&#13;
the margin are likely to be turned to the advantage of local vested interests&#13;
where land distribution is skewed and where local elites are powerful. In&#13;
the majority of rural projects land distribution is skewed and Local elites,&#13;
in the shape of local members of state or national legislatures, party offi-&#13;
cials, village leaders, mayors, landowners, businessmen, merchants, etc.,&#13;
are powerful.   The odds are therefore in favor of political infLuence on the&#13;
implementation process. In these circumstances, and in contrast to the&#13;
assumptions and hopes of the Redistribution with Growth approach, development&#13;
efforts which are "operations at the margin" may have quite literally only&#13;
marginal effects on the welfare of the rural poor.&#13;
The purpose of this pessimistic (but realistic) look at the context&#13;
of implementation is to stress that the rural development game is loaded&#13;
against success. Extra-bureaucratic influence from local elites acts as an&#13;
extremely significant additional "local pressure" on field staff, and one&#13;
which will not rationally be resisted without the strongest possible politi-&#13;
cal backing from superiors and ultimately national-level politicians. Ihese,&#13;
as we have seen, may well be members of a coalition of indifference to the&#13;
interests of the rural poor. Agencies must face this situation and decide&#13;
what to do about it. One possible approach -- pressing for widespread&#13;
redistributive measures -- is naive (or revolutionary) given the political&#13;
context.  Developing country governments (and often project managers) stay in&#13;
power by appeasing to a greater or lesser extent groups with significant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-64-&#13;
bargaining power--among whom the rural poor are likely to be the least&#13;
influential. Given that aid donors support gradualist rather than revolu-&#13;
tionary change, they implicitly accept this situation in principle, and must&#13;
seek compromise-measures that are realistic for third world governments. But&#13;
given that aid agencies have accepted a position of no more than operating at&#13;
the margin, they also have the greatest possible obligation to see that such&#13;
marginal operations do benefit the poor, and that aid does not become merely&#13;
a symbolic, public conscience-relieving gesture. They must therefore take a&#13;
conscious decision about the appropriate response to this obligation.&#13;
An Adequately Aggressive Response&#13;
The need is for funding agencies to make formal recognition of the&#13;
fact that implementation is a political process: that the pattern of incen-&#13;
tives and pressures operating within implementing organizations is the&#13;
product of a political system, influenced by the distribution of wealth and&#13;
power, relative factor prices, etc., outside the organization. These politi-&#13;
cal/economic realities, which effectively determine the pattern of incentives&#13;
and pressures in the wider society, are the environment of the development&#13;
bureaucracy: there is no way in which the bureaucracy can insulate itself&#13;
from them. With this recognition made, and assuming real commitment in the&#13;
funding agency to benefitting the rural poor, there are a number of pos-&#13;
sibilities for increasing the effectiveness of present efforts. In each case&#13;
below, a note is made of the informal real world priorities with which the&#13;
proposed action would be in conflict.&#13;
(1) Backing Political Commitment: Powerful rural development lobbies&#13;
occasionally emerge in developing countries. It may seem unnecessary to&#13;
state that all possible aid backing should be given in these cases: but in&#13;
practice, such lobbies do not always emerge in the areas where aid tends to&#13;
concentrate -- countries of strategic or commercial significance, or regimes&#13;
espousing "conservative liberal" doctrines.&#13;
(2) Recognizing Lack of Commitment: The corollary, withdrawing funds&#13;
from countries with a clear lack of commitment to rural development, may&#13;
be equally difficult politically, especially in the case of countries&#13;
of commercial potential, which often develop this through a&#13;
dualist/enclave/bimodal strategy which implies urban bias.&#13;
(3) Political/Management Appraisal: The previous measures imply the&#13;
need for more formal assessment of political commitment and motivation. This&#13;
paper has argued that the sensitivity of this area can be reduced by present-&#13;
ing the necessary assessment of political commitment as assessment of manage-&#13;
ment capacity and incentives. The informal disadvantages of greater atten-&#13;
tion to this area have been detailed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-65-&#13;
(4) Conditionality: The potential of conditionality was outlined&#13;
above. But this can prejudice good relations between donor and recipient,&#13;
and in any case is only applicable at the national as opposed to the project&#13;
level in countries small enough to be heavily dependent on aid.&#13;
(5) Restrictions on Target Groups: Development Alternatives, Inc.&#13;
(op. cit.) recommends restricting project membership to small farmers; or&#13;
putting an upper limit on the levels of services available so that they are&#13;
appropriate only for the amount of land a small farmer can maintain; or&#13;
reducing the degree of subsidy to larger farmers until they find lower cost&#13;
substitute service elsewhere. Political pressures from local e:Lites might&#13;
not allow this: and the problem of illegal leakages would remain.&#13;
(6) Funding More Local Recurrent Costs: Counterpart management efforts&#13;
are often hindered by budgetary constraints. Funding more locaL recurrent&#13;
costs would both break this constraint and legitimize greater donor involve-&#13;
ment in the management process. But this would be difficult for donors short&#13;
of foreign exchange, reduce tied aid and hence commercial benefits, and pose&#13;
problems of administrative supervision and accountability of funds.&#13;
(7) More Pilot Projects and Research: The lack of any real solution&#13;
for the problems of the disadvantaged, rain-fed areas should be recognized.&#13;
Less money should be thrown at them, more spent on pilot projects, and more&#13;
on technical assistance to research stations, which are still heavily biased&#13;
towards cash, irrigated and export crops, and technology suitable for larger&#13;
farmers. This would slow the disbursement of funds, and, thoughn it would&#13;
increase effective aid, would reduce apparent official commitments to the&#13;
poorest groups.&#13;
(8) Funding Through NGOs: Schemes like the British "pound-for-pound"&#13;
scheme could be expanded (where the donor matches privately raised funds&#13;
spent on approved development projects by approved voluntary agencies with&#13;
equal amounts from the aid budget). This has tremendous potential in terms&#13;
of avoiding recipient bureaucracies altogether and reaching the beneficiary&#13;
direct. But major expansion would reduce the empire and authority of both&#13;
donor and recipient bureaucracies, pose problems of accountability of public&#13;
funds, and oblige expanded NGOs to build up their own administrative super-&#13;
structure, their present lack of which is a main reason for their flexibility&#13;
and effectiveness.&#13;
Management by Incentives: A Realistic Minimum Response&#13;
The political pressures acting on donor development bureaucracies&#13;
make the effective implementation of some elements of the slightly aggressive&#13;
response outlined above unlikely. More realistically, perhaps the best that&#13;
can be hoped for is a greater formal recognition by funding agencies of the&#13;
dangers of mutation, a more rigorous scrutiny of recipient political commit-&#13;
ment, and greater attention to the management of implementation -- in short,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-66-&#13;
more attention to politics and incentives. In the light of increasing&#13;
inequality, project mutation and failure to date, such a politically oriented&#13;
approach is a necessary minimum. For the immediate future, the need is to&#13;
convince funding agencies that more active involvement in the politics of&#13;
implementation is necessary and feasible. Internally, academic and consult-&#13;
ant-generated information flows should stress and illustrate this need, and&#13;
should aim at developing practical methods for discouraging inefficiency and&#13;
project mutation. The hope is that this paper, with its "Management by&#13;
Incentives" approach to politics, will act as one such information flow, and&#13;
help to encourage a more active funding agency role in ensuring that develop-&#13;
ment funds aimed at the poor benefit the poor as planned.&#13;

APPENDIX&#13;
MECHANISTIC AND ORGANIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS&#13;
(Taken from Burns &amp; Stalker, 1961: 120)&#13;
"A mechanistic management system is appropriate to stable&#13;
conditions. It is characterized by:&#13;
(a) the specialized differentiation of functional tasks&#13;
into which the problems and tasks facing the concern&#13;
as a whole are broken down;&#13;
(b) the abstract nature of each individual task, which is&#13;
pursued with techniques and purposes more or less&#13;
distinct from those of the concern as a whole; i.e.,&#13;
the functionaries tend to pursue the technical improvement&#13;
of means, rather than the accomplishment of the ends of&#13;
the concern;&#13;
(c) the reconciliation, for each level in the hierarchy, of&#13;
these distinct performances by the immediate superiors,&#13;
who are also, in turn, responsible for seeing that each&#13;
is relevant in his own special part of the main t:ask;&#13;
(d) the precise definition of rights and obligations and&#13;
technical methods attached to each functional role;&#13;
(e) the translation of rights and obligations and technical&#13;
methods into the responsibilities of a functionaL&#13;
position;&#13;
(f) hierarchic structure of control, authority and communi-&#13;
cation;&#13;
(g) a reinforcement of the hierarchic structure by the&#13;
location of knowledge of actualities exclusively at&#13;
the top of the hierarchy, where the final reconciliation&#13;
of distinct tasks and assessment of relevance is made;&#13;
(h) a tendency for interaction between members of the&#13;
concern to be vertical, i.e., between superior and&#13;
subordinate;&#13;
(i) a tendency for operations and working behaviour to be&#13;
governed by the instructions and decisions issued by&#13;
superiors;&#13;
(j) insistence on loyalty to the concern and obedien,ce to&#13;
superiors as a condition of membership;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
(k) a greater importance and prestige attached to internal&#13;
(local) than to general (cosmopolitan) knowledge,&#13;
experience, and skill.&#13;
The organic form is appropriate to changing conditions, which give&#13;
rise constantly to fresh problems and unforeseen requirements for action&#13;
which cannot be broken down or distributed automatically arising from the&#13;
functional roles defined within a hierarchic structure. It is characterized&#13;
by:&#13;
(a) the contributive nature of special knowledge and experience&#13;
to the common task of the concern;&#13;
(b) the 'realistic' nature of the individual task, which is&#13;
seen as set by the total situation of the concern;&#13;
(c) the adjustment and continual re-definition of individual&#13;
tasks through interaction with others;&#13;
(d) the shedding of 'responsibility' as a limited field of&#13;
rights, obligations and methods. (Problems may be&#13;
posted upwards, downwards or sideways as being someone&#13;
else's responsibility.);&#13;
(e) the spread of commitment to the concern beyond any&#13;
technical definition.&#13;
(f) a network structure of control, authority and communi-&#13;
cation. The sanctions which apply to the individual's&#13;
conduct in his working role derive from presumed community&#13;
of interest with the rest of the working organization in&#13;
the survival and growth of the firm, and less from a&#13;
contractual relationship between himself and a non-&#13;
personal corporation, represented for him by an immediate&#13;
superior;&#13;
(g) omniscience no longer imputed to the head of the concern;&#13;
knowledge about the technical or commercial nature of&#13;
the here and now task may be located anywhere in the&#13;
network; this location becoming the ad hoc centre of&#13;
control authority and communication;&#13;
(h) a lateral rather than a vertical direction of communi-&#13;
cation through the organization, communication between&#13;
people of different rank, also, resembling consultation&#13;
rather than command;&#13;
(i) a content of communication which consists of information&#13;
and advice rather than instructions and decisions;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
(j)  commitment to the concern's tasks and to the 'techno-&#13;
logical ethos' of material progress and expansion is&#13;
more highly valued than loyalty and obedience;&#13;
(k) importance and prestige attach to affiliations and&#13;
expertise valid in the industrial and technical and&#13;
commercial milieux external to the firm."&#13;

            Bureaucratic politics and incentives in the
            management of rural development
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Management problems in the
            implementation of rural development are analyzed from a
            bureaucratic political standpoint. Proposals for management
            improvement will fail if they do not take account of
            informal interests and the patterns of incentives and
            pressures these create. At present, these informal
            incentives often make it irrational for managers and field
            staff to implement poverty-oriented programs as planned.
            Tentative methods are put forward for assessing incentives
            in rural development bureaucracies, and various means of
            influencing the 'incentive environment' are
            explored, with the aim of making it make sense for
            bureaucrats to be more responsive to the needs of poor
            beneficiaries. The broad aim is to examine the
            bureaucratic-politial determinants of implementation failure
            and success, with particular reference to poverty-oriented
            development in rural areas of the Third World.
