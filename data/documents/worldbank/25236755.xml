ï»¿Introduction&#13;
A World Bank Institute (WBI) review of 194 World Bank operational projects with&#13;
substantial capacity development components revealed critical issues related&#13;
to the measurement of capacity development results. This exploratory exercise&#13;
uncovered both potential strengths and shortcomings in current practice and&#13;
also pointed out ways that results could be improved for future capacity&#13;
development efforts.&#13;
Recent studies assert that training and technical assistance activities do not&#13;
consistently achieve or document intended outcomes. An evaluation conducted by&#13;
the World Bank Independent Evaluation Group, Capacity Building in Africa, found&#13;
the Bank "has not developed indicators to define capacity building outcomes"&#13;
and, by extension, "has not developed a body of knowledge on what tools should&#13;
be applied and how in different country and sector circumstances" (p. 44, World&#13;
Bank 2005). Other studies and reviews have drawn similar conclusions, highlighting&#13;
overarching challenges such as the lack of a conceptual framework and the poor&#13;
articulation of a results chain (OECD 2005, 2006; World Bank 2006, 2008; Taylor and&#13;
Clark 2008).&#13;
Despite donor allocations of more than $30 billion per year on capacity develop-&#13;
ment activities, a lack of consensus remains on what these activities include&#13;
and what results should be expected. If programs regularly fail to assess and&#13;
document capacity impact within their monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) systems,&#13;
development practitioners miss the opportunity for compiling evidence on which&#13;
interventions are most effective in different situations. WBI developed the Capacity&#13;
Development and Results Framework (CDRF) in response to this challenge, to&#13;
provide a systematic guide for results measurement of capacity development&#13;
interventions.&#13;
WBI's Capacity Development and Results practice (WBICR) examined Bank projects&#13;
to explore the potential value and feasibility of using the CDRF for assessing the&#13;
results of capacity development interventions. The review process relied on the&#13;
analysis of project appraisal documents (PADs), which describe how the results of&#13;
lending operations will be monitored, assessed, and documented throughout a&#13;
project's lifetime. This exercise aimed to find examples of indicators for illustrating&#13;
the application of the CDRF. However, broader lessons emerged related to the&#13;
state of current results measurement and the need for guidance and improvement.&#13;
This report shares the main findings of the review, including common pitfalls in&#13;
measuring results, current practices that are effective, and implications for the way&#13;
forward. Annex A describes the methodology used and Annex B lists the projects&#13;
reviewed.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿A Systematic Approach to Results&#13;
Measurement&#13;
WBI developed the CDRF through an ongoing consultative process within the&#13;
World Bank and among international development practitioners. Over the past&#13;
three years, outputs of the CDRF have been presented to and reviewed by Bank&#13;
personnel and client country audiences. Presentations to international audiences&#13;
include the High Level Retreat on the Effectiveness of International Development&#13;
Training (Berlin, June 2008) and the Forum on Improving the Results of Learning&#13;
for Capacity Building (Washington, DC, June 2009). This consultative process&#13;
allowed the CDRF to build on existing models for capacity assessment and&#13;
establish its comprehensive and systematic approach for guiding, measuring, and&#13;
communicating the results of capacity development interventions.&#13;
The CDRF is a strategic and country-led approach to capacity development that&#13;
emphasizes the empowerment of local agents through learning, knowledge, and&#13;
innovation. The CDRF serves as a valuable tool for evaluators and project teams by&#13;
articulating the results chain of capacity development activities-the progression&#13;
from needs assessments and interventions to outcomes and impact toward&#13;
development goals. Figure 1 presents an overview of the capacity development&#13;
process as defined by the CDRF.&#13;

Task teams and other development practitioners can use the CDRF to assess&#13;
and strengthen the results orientation of capacity development interventions. In&#13;
particular, the CDRF provides conceptual guidance for a capacity development&#13;
project, to identify the initial targeted capacity constraints, needed change&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿process(es), and indicators assigned to track this change. This guidance includes&#13;
adaptable sets of intermediate and final outcome indicators that can be flexibly&#13;
applied across sectors and countries.&#13;
This project review focuses on the final outcome level and measuring changes&#13;
in institutional capacity. The main technical features of the CDRF include a clear&#13;
specification of institutional capacity factors that can be enhanced through capacity&#13;
development interventions. Development objectives are defined in terms of&#13;
improvements in stakeholder ownership, policy-related and organizational capacity&#13;
areas as follows:&#13;
Strength of stakeholder ownership&#13;
The formal and informal political, economic and social forces that determine&#13;
the priority that government, civil society, and the private sector give to a&#13;
development goal. Shifts in this area are reflected by widespread changes in&#13;
attitudes or behaviors that cut across society.&#13;
Efficiency of policy instruments&#13;
The administrative rules, laws, regulations, standards, and other formal&#13;
incentives that a society uses to guide stakeholder actions to achieve&#13;
development goals. Policy-related capacity changes extend beyond the&#13;
design or implementation of a new policy, rule, or procedure to focus on the&#13;
effects on stakeholder actions that have occurred as a result.&#13;
Effectiveness of organizational arrangements&#13;
The systems, rules of action, processes, personnel and other resources that&#13;
state or non-state stakeholders bring together within a specific organization&#13;
to achieve a development goal. These capacity changes extend beyond the&#13;
development of individuals' knowledge and skills to focus on the results that&#13;
occur due to shifts in organizational behavior and performance.&#13;
For each of these institutional capacity areas the CDRF specifies contributing&#13;
characteristics that can be enhanced through capacity development interventions&#13;
(table 1, next page). Annex C provides an in-depth description of the 19&#13;
characteristics.&#13;
The CDRF's list of capacity characteristics provides a detailed guide to identify local&#13;
institutional capacity constraints to the achievement of a given development goal.&#13;
This process informs the customized design of capacity development interventions.&#13;
In addition, this set of capacity characteristics provides a comprehensive and&#13;
consistent approach for the measurement of capacity development results.&#13;
Assessing results across interventions and sectors provides comparable data that,&#13;
over time, could contribute to a body of knowledge about what does and does not&#13;
work in capacity development based on practical experiences.&#13;

This review of Bank projects indicates how the CDRF can be used to effectively&#13;
assess capacity development needs and results. The exercise revealed cross-&#13;
cutting examples of how the CDRFs capacity characteristics can feasibly be&#13;
measured in multiple sectors. At the same time, the review identified many cases&#13;
where project teams did not have sufficient guidance to measure their targeted&#13;
capacity changes.&#13;
These findings illustrate how the CDRF can improve M&amp;E practices for capacity&#13;
development interventions by facilitating a consistent, detailed approach for&#13;
defining, monitoring, assessing, and communicating results. The evidence suggests&#13;
that shortcomings related to the measurement of capacity development results can&#13;
be mitigated by integrating use of the CDRF into Bank operations.&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Effective Results Measurement in World&#13;
Bank Capacity Development Projects&#13;
WBICR examined PADs for projects with substantial capacity development&#13;
components to identify indicators and measures for assessing each of the CDRF's&#13;
capacity characteristics. The good practice examples that emerged confirmed&#13;
that the use of high-quality, precise results measures is feasible across sectors and&#13;
types of interventions. The presence of these examples, coupled with the missed&#13;
opportunities described in the next section, illustrate how the CDRF's detailed&#13;
results nomenclature and assessment process can facilitate greater accuracy,&#13;
consistency, and comprehensiveness in the measurement of capacity develop-&#13;
ment results.&#13;
Measuring widespread beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors can capture broad changes&#13;
in the strength of stakeholder ownership of capacity development. Project teams&#13;
could assess such changes by examining how aware stakeholders are of the gov-&#13;
ernment's actions related to a particular development goal; how much stakehold-&#13;
ers participate in decision-making; and to what degree stakeholders hold public&#13;
service providers accountable for achieving the development goal. Assessment&#13;
methods could also focus on the demonstrated commitment of leaders to the&#13;
development goal as evidenced through votes, public speeches or actions, and&#13;
budget allocations. Alternatively, the compatibility of current social norms with the&#13;
development goal could be measured through household surveys and other&#13;
methods to examine beliefs and behaviors among various population groups.&#13;
Some Bank projects accurately targeted, monitored, and assessed changes in&#13;
capacity related to stakeholder ownership. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa,&#13;
efforts in one country to increase the capacity of health facilities and programs&#13;
for treating and/or preventing HIV/AIDS transmission have been thwarted&#13;
by widespread prejudice against infected individuals and a pervasive lack of&#13;
understanding about transmission. A project component focused on media&#13;
broadcasting and community education to reduce this stigma and change&#13;
behaviors so that treatment and prevention programs would be supported and&#13;
sought out. Surveys assessed whether targeted changes in attitudes and behaviors&#13;
occurred. Table 2 provides examples of similar measures to assess shifts in&#13;
stakeholder ownership across sectors.&#13;
Assessments of the efficiency of policy instruments, according to the CDRF, focus&#13;
on measuring how administrative rules, regulations, procedures, or other formal&#13;
mechanisms guide stakeholder actions to achieve development goals. Useful&#13;
indicators might assess how clearly the regulation or rule clarifies the rights and&#13;
responsibilities of stakeholders or to what degree the formal mechanism is viewed&#13;
as fair and appropriate by the local population. Other considerations include the&#13;
degree of burden that the rule or process places on the implementers and the&#13;

incentives or barriers faced by those who should comply. Whether the mechanism&#13;
is creating unintended outcomes is an important consideration in some contexts.&#13;
Also, project teams could assess resistance of a new rule or procedure to&#13;
corruption by examining the degree to which actions are removed from individual&#13;
decision-making.&#13;
Examples of effective results measurement related to the efficiency of policy&#13;
instru-ments extend beyond the establishment or implementation of a new&#13;
formal mechanism (such as a policy, strategy, or procedure) to examine what&#13;
happened as a result. In southeastern Europe, for example, border crossing&#13;

police and customs officials were known to individually decide which vehicles&#13;
would be subjected to manual searches and requests for informal payments.&#13;
A new automated risk management procedure was implemented to dictate&#13;
which vehicles would be manually examined based on various predetermined&#13;
profiling characteristics. The project team tracked changes in the officials' corrupt&#13;
behavior by measuring the percentage of customs transactions that adhered&#13;
to new investigative guidelines and the occurrence of irregularities per number&#13;
of examinations (targeted to increase as officials become more selective in&#13;
conducting searches). Table 3 provides additional examples of how the efficiency&#13;
of policy instruments can be assessed across sectors.&#13;
The CDRF outlines how the effectiveness of organizational arrangements can&#13;
be evaluated by focusing on how an organization performs related to the&#13;
achievement of a particular development goal. Characteristics that might be&#13;
assessed include the level of organizational efficiency for producing outputs&#13;
related to the development goal (quality and cost) or the achievement of&#13;
outcomes contributing to the development goal. The financial viability or probity&#13;
of the organization can also be measured, as well as its ability to adapt in changing&#13;
circumstances or foster innovation. Stakeholder perceptions can also be explored:&#13;
How well do they understand the overall mission of the organization related to the&#13;
development goal and how effectively are they communicated with and engaged&#13;
to support the organization's work.&#13;

The arrangements of specific organizations are often assessed in the results&#13;
frameworks of Bank projects. In Southeast Asia, for example, a centralized&#13;
electricity company is highly subsidized to address a country's energy needs.&#13;
Capacity development activities focus on reforming the organizational&#13;
arrangements to promote long-term sustainability through cost recovery. The&#13;
financial viability of the company can then be monitored through measurements of&#13;
the self-financing ratio, the rate of return on revalued assets, and the debt service&#13;
coverage. Table 4 provides examples of other approaches in Bank projects for&#13;
assessing the effectiveness of organizational arrangements.&#13;
The presence of these good measures for assessing the CDRF's institutional&#13;
capacity characteristics helps to confirm that the use of a more precise and&#13;
comprehensive results measurement system is feasible within the competing&#13;
demands of Bank operations. The ongoing collection of effective examples can&#13;
serve as a resource for project teams in developing appropriate adapted results&#13;
measures for specific capacity characteristics, particularly as issues of comparability&#13;
across sector-specific practices and requirements become better understood.&#13;
As a result of this review, WBICR established the Institutional Capacity Indicators&#13;
Database to provide a searchable catalogue of indicators for monitoring and&#13;
measuring changes in capacity (see annex D).&#13;
Emerging Patterns for Results Measurement and Indicators&#13;
in Sectors&#13;
Variations in assessment practices by sector provide concrete examples of why&#13;
an adaptable and comprehensive approach is needed for assessing capacity&#13;
development results. If models for effective measurement in a specific sector are&#13;
understood within a detailed common framework (such as the CDRF), then good&#13;
practices can be more readily communicated and adapted for use in other sectors.&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Furthermore, common sector-specific omissions in results measurement are more&#13;
likely to be avoided if capacity needs assessments and results frameworks are&#13;
designed in terms of a standard list of measurable capacity characteristics.&#13;
In the projects analyzed, certain capacity challenges seemed more likely to be&#13;
targeted and monitored in some sectors than in others. Systematically exploring&#13;
these sector-specific approaches to assessing capacity development results could&#13;
reveal effective patterns for best practice sector models. The CDRF can guide and&#13;
facilitate the compilation of such models across sectors, capacity characteristics,&#13;
and types of interventions to support a systematic and comprehensive approach to&#13;
assessing capacity development results.&#13;
In this sample, assessments of organizational arrangements were most readily&#13;
available in sectors within the Sustainable Development and Human Development&#13;
Networks. For example, project results frameworks included indicators related&#13;
to the outcomes produced by a health facility, the financial viability of a water&#13;
company, or the satisfaction of users of an agriculture advisory service.&#13;
In contrast, indicators related to the efficiency of policy instruments were more&#13;
likely in sectors within the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network.&#13;
For example, these operations included indicators related to the level of resistance&#13;
of the public budgeting process to exceptional spending (how resistant the&#13;
process is to corruption); the accuracy with which ministry personnel understand&#13;
their responsibilities related to procurement rules (clarity of the new rules in&#13;
defining responsibilities of stakeholders); or the degree to which taxpayers adhere&#13;
to tax requirements (incentives for compliance with tax law).&#13;
Projects missed key capacity areas that should have been assessed and tracked.&#13;
In cases where teams isolated precise capacity characteristics, the absence of an&#13;
overarching framework for capacity assessment could mean that they overlooked&#13;
other types of relevant capacity characteristics. For example, in the Europe and&#13;
Central Asia region, a project team designed a lending operation to improve&#13;
the financial viability of a state-owned company responsible for supplying heat&#13;
in a capital city. They assigned indicators to evaluate the company's progress&#13;
in pass-ing the costs of supplying heat onto final consumers. These measures&#13;
focused solely on organizational performance and failed to monitor the broader&#13;
and more complex capacity development story. For instance, heating tariffs were&#13;
not set at the cost recovery level. Members of the municipal councils, who were&#13;
in charge of regulating the heating tariffs, resisted adjusting the tariffs because&#13;
it would have been politically unpopular. Thus, key constraints were overlooked&#13;
that needed to be addressed to achieve the company's financial viability related&#13;
to stakeholder ownership (the commitment of leaders and general attitudes within&#13;
the population) and the policy arena (suboptimal heating tariffs).&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿The CDRF can help to strengthen M&amp;E practice even for those projects with&#13;
effective indicators and measures in place. The use of the CDRF to guide a&#13;
systematic approach would allow practitioners across sectors to identify and&#13;
share promising models of capacity development results measurement, more&#13;
comprehensively assess capacity needs within a broader context, and identify and&#13;
resolve short-comings or omissions in results frameworks.&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Missed Opportunities for Assessing&#13;
Capacity Development Results&#13;
Aside from identifying examples of good practice, the review also examined com-&#13;
mon pitfalls related to the measurement of capacity development results in Bank&#13;
projects to clarify how and why the CDRF's systematic approach is needed. World&#13;
Bank projects are frequently designed to address "limited institutional capacity," but&#13;
this term is not clearly defined or consistently understood. Common references to&#13;
individual, organizational, institutional or societal capacity do not necessarily translate&#13;
to clear measurable outcomes. Furthermore, generic guidance for good M&amp;E prac-&#13;
tice has proven to be insufficient for identifying and assessing the change processes&#13;
and logical sequencing needed for achieving targeted capacity development results..&#13;
Emphasis on Outputs&#13;
Counting the tangible products and services provided by Bank operational&#13;
projects does not adequately describe which changes in institutional capacity&#13;
occurred as a result of the interventions. The training of individuals or groups must&#13;
result in changed behavior, such as the use and application of enhanced knowledge&#13;
or skills, improved collaboration or teamwork, or the design and implementation of&#13;
a new strategy or product. Even these changes, which certainly can be measureable&#13;
outcomes, are only an intermediate step along the results chain.&#13;
Projects often confuse outputs as outcomes and present them as intermediate or&#13;
final results. For example, an urban infrastructure and service delivery project&#13;
included an institutional strengthening component that supported training on&#13;
financial management and preparing urban development plans. A results indicator&#13;
for this component listed in the PAD is the number of trainees trained. Similarly, a&#13;
project aimed at developing institutional capacity for increasing access to basic&#13;
urban services identified the number of bus/lorry stands constructed as a key inter-&#13;
mediate outcome measure. Table 5 presents other examples of output measures&#13;
appearing as inappropriate measures for intermediate outcomes or final results.&#13;
The outputs of project activities cannot serve as effective proxy measures for&#13;
results. For example, projects often track measures such as the number of&#13;
people trained or the number of positions filled. Quantifying these outputs could&#13;
serve an important monitoring function for assessing whether a project is being&#13;
implemented as planned. Such measures should be appropriately assigned for&#13;
early steps in a project's results chain to better ensure accountability.&#13;
Emphasis on Intermediate Outcomes&#13;
Assessing whether project activities achieve their short-term objectives is a critical&#13;
step in monitoring progress along a results chain, but this does not provide insight&#13;
on program impact. Capacity development efforts often include training or techni-&#13;
cal assistance activities with learning objectives related to enhanced knowledge&#13;

&#13;
ï»¿and skills, improved processes (such as consensus or teamwork), and new products&#13;
(such as action plans, policies or strategies). These changes in status, behavior,&#13;
relationships and products are also known as intermediate outcomes, which serve&#13;
as stepping stones to changes in institutional capacity areas-shifts in the strength&#13;
of local stakeholder ownership, efficiency of policy-related instruments, or effective-&#13;
ness of organizational arrangements. However, they do not inform on the impact of&#13;
capacity development interventions.&#13;
Some Bank projects rely on intermediate outcome measures to provide evidence&#13;
of capacity development results. For example, a project to strengthen the quality&#13;
of education for health professionals uses the establishment of an independent&#13;
national accreditation agency as a key measure to assess results. However, the&#13;
establishment of this entity represents an altered process for accreditation rather&#13;
than an improvement in educational quality. This measure does not offer information&#13;
related to changes in the quality of education.&#13;
Similarly, a project to increase the access of underserved rural communities to basic&#13;
health services lists the development of a national health strategy to reduce inequali-&#13;
ties in access to health services as a project outcome measure. No assessment is&#13;
included or planned for whether such a strategy then leads to changes in social&#13;
behavior, policies, or organizational performance that would result in increased&#13;
access. Table 6 presents additional examples of how tracking intermediate outcomes&#13;
does not provide insight on project impact.&#13;
Intermediate outcomes cannot serve as proxy measures for changes in capacity. The&#13;
confusion between intermediate outcomes and final results that surfaces in project&#13;
results frameworks underscores the potential value of the CDRF. The CDRF can be&#13;
used to elucidate a capacity development intervention's results chain and then guide&#13;
the assignment of measures for short-term output and intermediate outcome levels.&#13;
Enhancing the skills of an agency's workforce, developing a new committee, or formu-&#13;
lating an action plan could be necessary outcomes on the way to achieving capacity&#13;
development results, but these alone are insufficient to claim changes in organiza-&#13;
tional performance or stakeholder actions for achieving a development goal.&#13;
Other Potential Problems&#13;
Omissions in measurement distort our understanding about what results are achieved.&#13;
The misplaced emphasis on outputs or intermediate outcomes was the most frequent&#13;
problem encountered in project documents, but additional shortcomings further&#13;
undermine the assessment of interventions. These shortcomings include the failure to&#13;
evaluate progress in addressing identified capacity constraints, claiming results at the&#13;
development goal level, and regularly overlooking certain characteristics of capacity.&#13;
Capacity challenges highlighted in a project's narrative are sometimes missing from&#13;
the results framework. For example, the PAD for a municipal development project&#13;
details the need to increase the efficiency in procedures for urban planning.&#13;

Examplies from project results frameworks&#13;
18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Outcomes mentioned in the narrative for the relevant project component include&#13;
reduction in the number of steps and files required for urban plan preparation and&#13;
development approvals. However, no measures related to decreasing this adminis-&#13;
trative burden are included in the project's results framework.&#13;
Projects typically do not assess the unintended outcomes of policy changes, even&#13;
when sector specialists understand that such externalities are likely to occur. For&#13;
example, changes in transport policy have been associated with increases in STDs&#13;
because truckers and other workers travel farther from home. Since transport has&#13;
become recognized as a social vector in the transmission of HIV/AIDS, a project&#13;
focused on the development and implementation of a country's strategy to improve&#13;
transport infrastructure includes activities to educate truckers about high-risk sexual&#13;
behavior. This education campaign is part of the project's activities, but no indica-&#13;
tors are included in the results framework to assess specific learning outcomes or to&#13;
evaluate whether unintended negative effects of the new infrastructure occurred.&#13;
Changes in targeted capacity characteristics sometimes go unmeasured despite&#13;
documented progress toward the achievement of a development goal. In these&#13;
cases, improvements in development goal-level indicators are reported as evidence&#13;
of project-level capacity development results. For example, in a project for increas-&#13;
ing access to secondary education, the project tracked increases in gross enroll-&#13;
ment rates in lower and upper secondary education and used them as out-come&#13;
measures to show success. However, no information is included about what changes&#13;
in capacity have occurred to promote and sustain increased enrollment. Have social&#13;
norms changed so that more parents are pursuing schooling for their children? Or,&#13;
perhaps a policy change made it easier for students to enroll? Or, at the organiza-&#13;
tional level, perhaps local schools are operating more effectively in attracting and&#13;
retaining the local school-age population?&#13;
Without charting progress in overcoming a specific capacity challenge, a project&#13;
team cannot accurately assess whether capacity development activities are making&#13;
the intended contribution to the development goal or monitor project implemen-&#13;
tation and make adjustments as needed. This latter aspect is important given the&#13;
complexity of institutional change processes&#13;
In the results frameworks examined, Bank operations overlooked certain types of&#13;
capacity changes. Project teams might identify one or more challenges to address&#13;
through capacity development activities, but they do not typically draw from a stan-&#13;
dardized menu of capacity areas and characteristics to help them think through all of&#13;
the variables constraining local capacity. In particular, this review identified few exam-&#13;
ples where teams assess characteristics related to the efficiency of policy instruments,&#13;
such as rules, regulations, standards and formal procedures. Such characteristics in-&#13;
clude the level of administrative burden imposed or the unintended consequences&#13;
caused by a formal mechanism. Another aspect rarely evaluated is whether a policy-&#13;
related instrument is sufficiently flexible to adapt to changing local conditions.&#13;

ï»¿Conclusions and Recommendations for&#13;
Strengthening the Measurement of Results&#13;
The review of appraisal documents for 194 projects in the Bank's lending portfolio&#13;
provided important insights and guidance to strengthen the results orientation of&#13;
capacity development interventions. First, existing examples of effective results&#13;
measurement for capacity development interventions illustrate the potential value&#13;
of the CDRF for more systematically and consistently defining and measuring&#13;
targeted changes in capacity across sectors. Second, although good M&amp;E practice&#13;
should consistently include an articulated results chain, the sequence from inputs&#13;
to results often remains undefined for the capacity development components of&#13;
projects. The CDRF is designed to demystify capacity development-to spel out&#13;
how progress can be measured along the path from inputs to results.&#13;
It is critical to improve the measurement of capacity development results. This&#13;
exercise highlighted common problems in current practice, including confusing&#13;
outputs or intermediate outcomes with results and overlooking key capacity chal-&#13;
lenges in assessing progress toward achieving change. The absence of a detailed,&#13;
effective, and widely accepted approach for capacity development assessment has&#13;
important implications for Bank operations:&#13;
* Uneven quality among results measures produces inconsistencies, even&#13;
within a single project, in how outcomes are characterized and measured.&#13;
Teams assign effective measures at times but miss opportunities in other cases&#13;
for tracking results. This dynamic underscores the need for a more systematic&#13;
approach.&#13;
* Lack of a common language in measuring capacity development results makes&#13;
it difficult to compare outcomes across types of interventions and sectors.&#13;
If practitioners across projects and sectors identify and characterize capacity&#13;
changes using a standardized framework, they could accumulate a body of&#13;
knowledge around which interventions are effective and in what context.&#13;
Recommendations&#13;
Integrate the use of the CDRF into Bank projects&#13;
The 194 project results frameworks collectively illustrate why a more consistent&#13;
and accurate approach is needed to assess the results of capacity development&#13;
components. Identifying example measures for evaluating changes related to the&#13;
CDRF's capacity characteristics demonstrated the feasibility of using the framework&#13;
to guide a more consistent and precise assessment process across interventions&#13;
and sectors. Use of the CDRF among Bank teams and stakeholders is likely to be&#13;
facilitated by:&#13;
* Providing tools and resources to support operational staff in using the CDRF-&#13;
A learning process is required to become familiar with and successfully apply&#13;
the CDRF. Resources to support this process include the Institutional Capacity&#13;
20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Indicators Database and an institutional diagnostic toolkit. Other resources&#13;
should be explored for guiding practitioners to assess capacity constraints and&#13;
targeted capacity changes.&#13;
Identifying a cadre of champions across sectors to support teams in applying&#13;
the CDRF-Understanding the institutional capacity areas and their contributing&#13;
capacity characteristics requires hands-on experience in articulating the results&#13;
chains for capacity development interventions and defining indicators and&#13;
measures. A roster of CDRF specialists would help guide and refine this process.&#13;
Continue the investigation of results measurement for capacity development&#13;
interventions&#13;
This review has, at minimum, highlighted recurring shortcomings related to the as-&#13;
sessment and documentation of outcomes. Understanding current practice better&#13;
and planning improvements could include:&#13;
* Examining and revising the policies and procedures guiding results&#13;
measurement-This review suggests that the current requirements for assessing&#13;
project results are insufficient to ensure sound M&amp;E practice. For example, the&#13;
current format for PADs in general and results frameworks in particular does not&#13;
necessarily prompt teams to define steps along a results chain (that is, outputs&#13;
versus outcomes). In addition, the review process for required documentation is&#13;
not effectively preventing common shortcomings in results measurement.&#13;
* Conducting a scientific study of current practices using a representative&#13;
sample of Bank projects-This review facilitates understanding the landscape&#13;
for capacity development results measurement at the Bank. However, more&#13;
evidence and guidance regarding current practice would be gained by&#13;
designing a study based on a random sample of projects wherein the findings&#13;
could be generalized to the larger population of projects in Bank operations.&#13;
This study could serve as part of a larger study to examine capacity development&#13;
results and pinpoint best practices.&#13;
Require practitioners to more systematically monitor and assess results and&#13;
then use the lessons learned for continual program improvement&#13;
Strengthening results measurement in the Bank must go beyond refining the&#13;
project results frameworks in PADs to include iteratively applying the information&#13;
collected during program design and implementation. The CDRF provides&#13;
a practical resource for guiding good M&amp;E practice throughout the capacity&#13;
development project cycle to better ensure that desired capacity changes are&#13;
effectively targeted and achieved.&#13;

ï»¿ANNEX A&#13;
Process for Selecting and Reviewing Projects&#13;
WBICR designed the review of Bank operational projects to locate examples of&#13;
how the CDRF's institutional capacity characteristics are assessed in current prac-&#13;
tice. The project selection and review process evolved as needed to identify&#13;
projects with substantial capacity development components in a range of sectors.&#13;
This exercise produced a database of example indicators aligned with the CDRF.&#13;
The lessons learned regarding the strengths and weaknesses of current practice&#13;
among Bank teams and their implications for planning improvements are the basis&#13;
for this report.&#13;
Project Selection&#13;
To facilitate the collection of diverse examples for measuring capacity develop-&#13;
ment results, the sampling process identified projects for review based on their&#13;
focus in priority sectors, the strength of their capacity development component(s),&#13;
and the date they became active.&#13;
* Sectors-Although indicators aligned with the CDRF can be assigned in projects&#13;
in any sector, the project sampling concentrated on sectors considered to be&#13;
current strategic priorities for WBI. These included areas within three networks:&#13;
* Human development-education; health, nutrition and population; HIV/&#13;
AIDS; social protection; and children and youth.&#13;
* Sustainable development-agriculture and rural development; social&#13;
development; infrastructure; energy; environment; urban development;&#13;
and water.&#13;
* Poverty reduction and economic management-economic policy and debt;&#13;
gender and development; poverty reduction; public sector governance;&#13;
and trade.&#13;
* Capacity development-The selection process targeted projects in which&#13;
training and technical assistance activities were incorporated into components&#13;
for developing local capacity. The online search function for locating Bank&#13;
projects (available at www.worldbank.org/projects) is effective for locating such&#13;
projects only if "capacity development" or other useful identifier is entered as&#13;
keywords. Each project synopsis posted online was examined and then project&#13;
descriptions within PADs were scanned. WBICR selected those Bank operations&#13;
that emphasized capacity development for a full review.&#13;
* Project age-Through the implementation of and adherence to the Bank's&#13;
results agenda, teams progressively strengthened the M&amp;E frameworks of&#13;
individual projects. To capitalize on this increasing results-based focus, the&#13;
sampling process focused mainly on projects that became active in 2006 or later.&#13;
WBICR determined this cutoff because project results frameworks followed a&#13;
new format after the mainstreaming of the results-based country assistance&#13;
strategy in the second half of fiscal year 2005.&#13;
23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿WBICR also identified and reviewed projects based on recommendations from&#13;
different team members and other sources, such as the lists of capacity devel-&#13;
opment projects spotlighted by the World Bank Operations Policy and Country&#13;
Services unit. Therefore, most but not all of the projects fit within the categories&#13;
outlined above.&#13;
Document Review&#13;
Once WBICR identified projects as having a capacity development component,&#13;
they examined the PAD for model examples to illustrate how the CDRF's institu-&#13;
tional capacity characteristics are assessed. Three sections of the PAD were&#13;
explored to map indicators and measures to the CDRF:&#13;
* Results framework-The project results framework and monitoring&#13;
arrangements table for a Bank project are typically organized by project&#13;
component. Project teams assign indicators for results, intermediate outcomes,&#13;
and outputs levels, but this hierarchy is not consistently used. Thus, the review&#13;
considered any indicators assessing capacity development placed anywhere in&#13;
the results framework.&#13;
* Project description-The assessment of capacity development results is&#13;
concerned with the outcomes achieved by capacity development interventions.&#13;
In some cases, it is unclear whether the project components listed in a results&#13;
framework involve training and technical assistance activities. In these cases, the&#13;
review included the more detailed review of the narrative sections describing&#13;
project activities. The annex following the results framework in the PAD often&#13;
served as a source for this information.&#13;
* Country and sector background-In some cases, the context for indicators&#13;
and measures listed in the project results framework is unclear. Which capacity&#13;
constraints are the project designed to address? Are the proposed measures&#13;
appropriate for assessing progress in overcoming these capacity constraints?&#13;
At times, the selection of example indicators and measures required a review&#13;
of additional narrative sections of the PAD to better understand the project&#13;
context. This information was usually available in either the opening section&#13;
(Strategic Context and Rationale) or in the first annex (Country and Sector or&#13;
Program Background).&#13;
WBICR identified indicators and measures through this process to illustrate the use&#13;
of the CDRF if they met each of conditions below.&#13;
* They effectively measured an institutional capacity area. Specifically, the&#13;
outcome indicator reflected changes in one of three areas:&#13;
* Widespread perceptions or behaviors that extend beyond specific&#13;
organizations-possibly measuring the strength of stakeholder ownership&#13;
related to a particular development goal&#13;
* Aspects related to administrative rules, laws, regulations, or standards&#13;
to ensure the coordinated and efficient pursuit of a development goal&#13;
by diverse stakeholders-possibly measuring the efficiency of policy&#13;
instruments&#13;
24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿* The use of systems, rules of action, processes, personnel, and other&#13;
resources within specific organizations to advance the development goal-&#13;
possibly measuring the effectiveness of organizational arrangements.&#13;
* They were associated with a development goal. The outcome indicator must&#13;
reflect progress related to a specified economic or social benefit.&#13;
* They focused on a specific characteristic of institutional capacity. Indicators&#13;
that cannot be disaggregated to the level of a specific capacity characteristic&#13;
do not serve as strong examples. In limited cases, an indicator might serve&#13;
as a proxy measure as long as some part of it represents a specific capacity&#13;
characteristic.&#13;
* They adhered to good M&amp;E practice. This exercise aimed to find existing good&#13;
examples that did not need revision to be effective. To the extent possible, each&#13;
indicator and measured adhered to the SMART criteria (specific, measurable,&#13;
achievable, relevant, and time-bound).&#13;
Indicators that met these conditions became examples for inclusion in the Insti-&#13;
tutional Capacity Indicators Database (see annex D). During this process, WBICR&#13;
noted recurring issues related to the measurement of capacity development results&#13;
and began recording these observations and collecting examples. These observa-&#13;
tions formed the basis for this report.&#13;

ï»¿ANNEX C&#13;
Institutional Capacities and Their&#13;
Contributing Characteristics&#13;
Three broad areas of institutional capacity and their contributing characteristics&#13;
can help assess institutional capacity needs, inform design, and measure progress&#13;
toward results for a capacity development strategy or intervention.&#13;
Strength of Stakeholder Ownership&#13;
How strong is stakeholder ownership of the development goal? Ownership&#13;
comprises formal and informal political, economic and social forces that determine&#13;
the priority that government, civil society, and the private sector give to a&#13;
development goal.&#13;
Institutional                           Areas Covered&#13;
Characteristic&#13;
Commitment     Social and political leaders consistently and regularly support the develop-&#13;
of social      ment goal through public statements, decisions, votes, and other actions&#13;
and political  demonstrating their commitment and accountability for achievement of the&#13;
leaders        goal. Leaders demonstrate sound ethics and integrity related to the goal,&#13;
faithfully honoring their pledges of support and not engaging in activities or&#13;
missions that would undermine progress toward the goal.&#13;
Compatibility  The social norms and widespread beliefs that shape the behavior of local&#13;
of social norms  stakeholders are compatible with the development goal.&#13;
and values&#13;
Stakeholder    Priority-setting processes related to the development goal include oppor-&#13;
participation  tunities for all stakeholders to express opinions freely and without fear of&#13;
in setting     repression, and these opportunities are communicated with adequate time&#13;
priorities     for stakeholder engagement and response. Stakeholders actively participate&#13;
through these established mechanisms, and government and other public&#13;
service entities are responsive to the expressed views of civil society and&#13;
other relevant parties.&#13;
Stakeholder    Stakeholders know their rights related to the development goal, claim those&#13;
demand for     rights, and communicate their grievances and proposals for change to&#13;
accountability  the government and legislature. If public officials and other public service&#13;
providers fail to meet expectations about the achievement of the goal or&#13;
are using allocated resources for unintended purposes, stakeholders freely&#13;
hold them accountable for their conduct and performance. Stakeholders&#13;
organize and collectively appeal unfavorable decisions concerning the&#13;
goal. Stakeholders demand and use instruments of accountability that are&#13;
available to the public, such as government scorecard information.&#13;
Transparency   Government and other public service entities provide accurate, relevant,&#13;
of information  verifiable, and timely information about the development goal to all&#13;
to stakeholders  stakeholders. They also explain actions concerning the goal in terms that&#13;
stakeholders can use to participate in setting priorities, monitoring progress,&#13;
and evaluating actions of public officials responsible for the goal. Any&#13;
information influencing decisions related to the goal is fully disclosed to&#13;
stakeholders.&#13;
31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Efficiency of Policy Instruments&#13;
How efficient are policy instruments in guiding stakeholder behavior toward&#13;
achieving the development goal? The efficiency of policy instruments comprises&#13;
the administrative rules, laws, regulations, standards, and other formal incentives&#13;
that a society uses to guide stakeholder actions to achieve its development goals.&#13;
Institutional                            Areas Covered&#13;
Characteristic&#13;
Clarity in     The rights and responsibilities of stakeholders related to the development&#13;
defining       goal are clearly defined and communicated. Stakeholders share a common&#13;
rights and     understanding of the policy goal and the targets of any specified regulations.&#13;
responsi-      The authorities and processes concerning the policy instrument are clearly&#13;
bilities       identified and communicated to stakeholders. Stakeholders understand the&#13;
objectives, rights and responsibilities prescribed by the policy instrument.&#13;
Consistency    Policy instrument related to the development goal is consistent with policy&#13;
instruments for other goals. The objectives, rights and responsibilities&#13;
established by the policy instrument related to the goal do not conflict with&#13;
those for other goals.&#13;
Legitimacy     Policy instrument is formulated based on an informed, transparent,&#13;
participatory, and deliberate process. The instrument conforms to&#13;
recognized principles and standards and is perceived as desirable and&#13;
appropriate within the local system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions.&#13;
Stakeholders and unaffiliated expert reviewers perceive the actions and&#13;
sanctions prescribed by the policy as fair. Stakeholders' rights to appeal are&#13;
assured by the policy instrument.&#13;
Incentives for  Policy instrument facilitates desired economic and social exchange activities&#13;
compliance     related to the development goal, minimizes uncertainty, time, information&#13;
and other costs to participants in these transactions, and provides&#13;
sanctions for non-compliance. Possible measures include: share of targeted&#13;
stakeholders who elect self-policing, self-auditing, or self-disclosure options&#13;
provided by the policy instrument; share of targeted stakeholders who&#13;
comply with provisions of the policy instrument.&#13;
Ease of        Policy instrument is administratively easy for the regulatory or governing&#13;
administration  body to implement. Implementation incurs only those administrative costs&#13;
required to achieve the intended policy outcomes related to the goal.&#13;
Administrative tasks are defined and allocated with consideration of duty&#13;
bearers' competencies, existing responsibilities, and available resources.&#13;
Risk for       Policy instrument minimizes unintended negative impacts. Targeted&#13;
negative       beneficiaries, non-beneficiaries, and other non-regulated stakeholders do&#13;
externalities  not experience foreseeable unintended costs or ill effects as a result of the&#13;
policy instrument.&#13;
Suitable       Policy instrument is predictably flexible in addressing varying situations. The&#13;
flexibility    policy instrument allows for timely revision when the underlying social and&#13;
political circumstances have changed. The policy instrument is explicit in&#13;
defining the conditions under which its terms should be revised.&#13;
Resistance to  Policy instrument minimizes opportunities for corruption, rent seeking, and&#13;
corruption     regulatory capture; includes mechanisms to monitor and report corruption;&#13;
and provides credible and enforceable penalties for corrupt behavior.&#13;
The policy instrument does not reflect the efforts of vested interests to&#13;
manipulate the economic and/or legal environment to secure undue&#13;
privileges or compensation at the expense of the greater public good.&#13;
32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Effectiveness of Organizational Arrangements&#13;
How effective are organizational arrangements in achieving the development goal?&#13;
The effectiveness of organizational arrangements comprises the systems, rules of&#13;
action, processes, personnel, and other resources that state or non-state stake-&#13;
holders bring together to achieve a development goal.&#13;
Institutional                           Areas Covered&#13;
Characteristic&#13;
Clarity of     The vision and mission of the organization/group are strongly aligned with&#13;
mission        the goal and articulated, providing its members with points of reference&#13;
for formulating strategy, making decisions, and gaining commitment from&#13;
management, staff, and other stakeholders to work toward the goal. Relevant&#13;
stakeholders recognize the mandate of the organization&#13;
Achievement    The organization/group consistently seeks and achieves outcomes that lead&#13;
of outcomes    directly to the goal.&#13;
Operational    The strategies, inputs, processes, and technology of the organization/group&#13;
efficiency     are managed to optimize the quantity and quality of output, relative to the&#13;
cost of accomplishing its support for the goal.&#13;
Financial      The organization/group secures the funds .needed to cover its operating&#13;
viability and  costs sustainably and allocates funds according to business needs. Financial&#13;
probity        management includes the tracking of expenditures on a functional basis&#13;
to inform future budget forecasting, decision-making, and accountability&#13;
reporting. Organizational systems and practices support and enforce&#13;
transparent financial management, including the reporting of externally&#13;
verified accounts, to ensure that the organization's resources are allocated&#13;
effectively to achieve its stated goal.&#13;
Communi-       The organization/group seeks and obtains the support of stakeholders for its&#13;
cations and    work related to the development goal. Organizational decision-making and&#13;
stakeholder    operational processes involve consultations and proactive communications&#13;
relations      with appropriate stakeholders.&#13;
Adaptability   The organization/group regularly monitors its internal and external&#13;
environment for information relevant to the development goal and is&#13;
proactive in adapting its strategy accordingly. The organization encourages&#13;
innovation in strategies, processes and products; manages knowledge;&#13;
rewards performance; and creates and/or adapts to new technologies.&#13;
33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿ANNEX D&#13;
Overview of the Institutional Capacity&#13;
Indicators Database&#13;
The Institutional Capacity Indicators Database can help task teams to monitor,&#13;
evaluate, and report tangible results for their capacity development programs.&#13;
The database is a searchable catalogue of real-world capacity characteristics and&#13;
their indicators. In this way, project teams can break institutional capacities down&#13;
into observable and measurable units to inform program design, monitor and&#13;
measure changes, and manage results.&#13;
*W Easteral .et se  nts-dual stre s staingewrtis ten y meagate&#13;
http://wbicdrf.worldbank.0rg&#13;
Background&#13;
Task teams often need concrete results for capacity development initiatives, to&#13;
show the viability of their efforts and accountability to stakeholders and donors.&#13;
However, evaluation of capacity development activities often focuses on measur-&#13;
ing outputs rather than outcomes. Also, the absence of appropriate indicators and&#13;
failure to effectively track them limit the possibility for task teams to make needed,&#13;
timely adjustments to their programs.&#13;
WBI developed the Institutional Capacity Indicators Database as a convenient tool&#13;
for task teams to find examples of indicators and measures for various institutiona&#13;
capacity challenges their projects face. The database features examples of indica-&#13;
tors from a review of development databases and approximately 200 existing and&#13;
closed World Bank projects across sectors and regions. The database can make it&#13;
easier for task teams to take a results-focused approach to capacity development&#13;
programs and improve project design, implementation, and management.&#13;
34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Uses and Benefits&#13;
Task teams can search the Institutional Capacity Indicators Database to:&#13;
* Identify characteristics of institutional capacity to inform program design&#13;
* Identify indicators of those characteristics for periodic data collection to monitor&#13;
and evaluate institutional change&#13;
* Prioritize characteristics according to the most needed results to better target&#13;
interventions&#13;
* Expand their understanding of results management for capacity development&#13;
Real-World Example&#13;
Doreen is a task team leader within an urban development sector who focuses on&#13;
public sector governance. She is working on a capacity development program with&#13;
the goal of improving public services in targeted urban areas. She initially planned&#13;
to focus primarily on organizational capacity development. However, after working&#13;
with stakeholders and using the Institutional Capacity Indicators Database to inform&#13;
the needs assessment, she adopted a more comprehensive approach to institu-&#13;
tional capacities that also targeted the capacity area of stakeholder ownership.&#13;
Through the database, Doreen understood how constraints to stakeholder own-&#13;
ership could thwart the program's ability to achieve locally owned results. She&#13;
searched the database for examples of capacity characteristic outcome indicators&#13;
and their measures to help inform program design. Together with stakeholders,&#13;
Doreen also prioritized the characteristics according to the most needed results.&#13;
By working with the database, Doreen was able to better allocate limited funds for&#13;
the capacity development program and to support needed results in a previously&#13;
neglected capacity area. Program planning became a more transparent and collab-&#13;
orative process with stakeholders in identifying capacity characteristics, indicators,&#13;
and data measures for local M&amp;E practice.&#13;
An example of an institutional capacity characteristic, its indicator and measure&#13;
that Doreen will use in the capacity development program is charted below.&#13;

ï»¿A review of appraisal documents for approximately&#13;
200 projects in the World Bank's lending portfolio&#13;
provides important insights for strengthening the results&#13;
measurement of capacity development components.&#13;
Missed opportunities found in the projects' results&#13;
frameworks demonstrate the need for a more systematic&#13;
approach for monitoring and assessing results.&#13;
At the same time, isolated good practices confirm the&#13;
feasibility of using the World Bank Insitute's Capacity&#13;
Development and Results Framework to address this&#13;
need. Findings from the review describe why and&#13;
how this framework could help project teams more&#13;
effectively measure and communicate results of capacity&#13;
development interventions.&#13;

            A review of capacity development results
            measurement in World Bank projects : the need for a
            systematic approach
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A World Bank Institute (WBI) review of
            194 WB operational projects with substantial capacity
            development components revealed critical issues related to
            the measurement of capacity development results. This
            exploratory exercise uncovered both potential strengths and
            shortcomings in current practice and also pointed out ways
            that results can be improved for future capacity development
            efforts. WBI’s capacity development and results (WBICR)
            practice examined Bank projects to explore the potential
            value and feasibility of using the capacity development and
            results framework (CDRF) for assessing the results of
            capacity development interventions. The review process
            relied on the analysis of project appraisal documents
            (PADs), which describe how the results of lending operations
            will be monitored, assessed, and documented throughout a
            project’s lifetime. This exercise aimed to find examples of
            indicators for illustrating the application of the CDRF.
            However, broader lessons emerged related to the state of
            current results measurement and the need for guidance and
            improvement. This report shares the main findings of the
            review, including common pitfalls in measuring results,
            current practices that are effective, and implications for
            the way forward. Annex A describes the methodology used and
            annexes B lists the projects reviewed.
