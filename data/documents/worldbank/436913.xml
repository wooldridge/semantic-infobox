CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC&#13;
URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Credit and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:         Government of the Central African Republic&#13;
Implementing&#13;
Agencies:         MPS and ATRACOM&#13;
Beneficiaries:     ATRACOM&#13;
Poverty:          Not applicable&#13;
Credit Amount:    SDR 12.9 million (US$18.8 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:             Standard IDA terms, with 40 years' maturity&#13;
Commitment Fee:  0.50% on undisbursed credit balances, beginning 60 days after signing, less&#13;
any waiver&#13;
Grant&#13;
Arrangement:       The Government will make available to ATRACOM SDR 7.4 million&#13;
(US$10.8 million equivalent) on grant terms.&#13;
Project Objectives: IDA sector strategy has a three-pronged approach to: (a) consolidate the&#13;
institutional capacity to coordinate, plan and program urban investment; (b)&#13;
set up an autonomous agency to contract out works execution; and (c)&#13;
ensure sustainable and appropriate funding of urban infrastructure. Within&#13;
this strategy, the immediate objectives of the project are: (a) to finance&#13;
priority investments in Bangui which will contribute to alleviate chronic&#13;
flooding in the city -to which the poor are particularly vulnerable- and&#13;
improve the living conditions of the lower income neighborhoods by: (i)&#13;
participating in the Government's efforts to rehabilitate the main&#13;
infrastructure by improving primary drainage; and (ii) improving and&#13;
expanding water supply' and sanitary facilities, secondary and tertiary&#13;
drainage and street infrastructure in selected neighborhoods; and (b) to&#13;
contribute to the development of the private sector, especially SMEs in the&#13;
construction industry, by executing most of the works through an efficient&#13;
executing agency. The long-term objective of the project is to promote an&#13;
integrated and participatory development of Bangui -replicable in other&#13;
cities- by developing appropriate mechanisms of dialogue and participation&#13;
between the population and the Government at its different levels.&#13;
i&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project&#13;
Description:       The project has the following components:&#13;
(a)   Rehabilitation and extension of the primary drainage system in the&#13;
city of Bangui;&#13;
(b)   Integrated and participatory neighborhood development, including&#13;
water, sanitation, and secondary and tertiary drainage and street&#13;
infrastructure;&#13;
(c)   Institutional support to implementing agencies, including training,&#13;
consultants' services, and incremental operational costs.&#13;
Environmental&#13;
Impact:           The project will improve living conditions through better drainage systems,&#13;
sanitation, water supply and waste management, particularly in the poorest&#13;
areas of Bangui. The resettlement plan for about 150 households who will&#13;
have to move as the drainage canals are improved will ensure that their&#13;
standard of living and income capacity will be restored or improved after&#13;
resettlement.&#13;
Benefits:         Benefits associated with the overhaul of the drainage system  and&#13;
neighborhood development include improved health conditions, which have&#13;
a particularly positive impact on workers' productivity by reducing&#13;
absenteeism, thus benefiting the whole economy. Furthermore, the&#13;
improved drainage system is expected to reduce annual costs of repair and&#13;
maintenance of houses, and bring about substantial time savings.&#13;
Quantifiable benefits used in calculating the economic rate of return of the&#13;
whole project are: (a) reduction in absenteeism related to waterborne and&#13;
insect borne diseases; (b) reduction in cost of maintenance and repair of&#13;
houses related to suppression of recurrent flooding; and (c) time savings as&#13;
a result of the improved drainage system and neighborhood development.&#13;
Economic Rate&#13;
of Return:         17%&#13;
Risks:            The two main risks associated with the project are: (a) delays in project&#13;
execution; and (b) shortfalls in the financial resources required to maintain&#13;
the assets created under the project. Both risks would have a significantly&#13;
negative effect on the expected ERR of the project. For example, a three-&#13;
year delay in project completion would lower the ERR to 16 percent. A&#13;
two-year interruption after two years of project implementation would&#13;
lower the ERR to 15 percent. Lack of maintenance of the assets created&#13;
under the project would lower the ERR to 11 percent. Several steps have&#13;
been taken to mitigate the above risks. First, the autonomous agency for&#13;
the work contracting will be provided under the project with technical&#13;
assistance, and administrative and accounting support. Also, the scope of&#13;
the project has been kept relatively modest in order not to stretch the new&#13;
agency's implementation capacity. Second, in the short term, resources for&#13;
maintenance will be provided by the FAEU. In the long term, the ongoing&#13;
ii&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
reforms of municipal finance are expected to provide a complementary&#13;
source of financing.  In addition, the project's focus on community&#13;
participation for rehabilitation of the neighborhoods' infrastructure will&#13;
ensure an enhanced maintenance of the facilities.&#13;
Poverty Impact:   Assuming that at least 30 percent of local contracts in the construction&#13;
sector is spent on salaries and wages for unskilled labor, about US$3&#13;
million will go directly to the poorest urban workers in the form of wages.&#13;
Private Sector&#13;
Development:       The expected success of the Works Execution Agency will stem from its&#13;
managerial autonomy which will allow it independence and autonomy from&#13;
the cumbersome contracting and payment procedures of the public sector,&#13;
and therefore promote the development of SMEs which need swift&#13;
payments. This approach has demonstrated the benefits of applying private&#13;
sector practices to public sector projects. It will serve in CAR as an&#13;
important complement to other privatization efforts by demonstrating&#13;
private sector management benefits.&#13;

Background&#13;
CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC&#13;
URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. ECONOMIC CONTEXT&#13;
1.1   Background. With an area of 623,000 kM2, a population of about 3.2 million,&#13;
growing at 2.5 percent per annum, an average of five inhabitants per kM2, and a per capita&#13;
GNP of $370 in 1994, the Central African Republic (CAR) has rich but almost&#13;
unexploited natural resources. Only one-tenth of its arable land is under cultivation and&#13;
forest resources are plentiful. Economic development however, is severely handicapped&#13;
by long and difficult transport routes to and from the ocean. Up to 60 percent of the&#13;
country's export earnings come from artisanal diamond mining. Diamonds are exported&#13;
by air but other exports (timber, coffee, cotton and livestock) and imports have to travel&#13;
by surface transportation, either by road to Cameroon or road/river to Congo. Bangui,&#13;
the capital city founded on the low Ubangi rivershore, grew through the years to be the&#13;
principal trade hub and economic pole of the country. The deplorable state of social&#13;
services and basic infrastructure, which deteriorated severely during the past decade, is&#13;
another constraint to growth. Average life expectancy is estimated at 49 years at birth,&#13;
and 49 percent of the total population is literate. Poverty is pervasive in CAR. It is&#13;
estimated that two-thirds of the population live in poverty, and one-third in extreme&#13;
poverty. The extremely poor are predominantly farmers, while about 30% of the poor are&#13;
urban residents, public sector employees or unemployed.&#13;
1.2   Adjustment Performance 1986-93. CAR's economy declined in the late 1970s&#13;
and early 1980s as a result of inappropriate economic policies.  The Government&#13;
intervened heavily in virtually all economic activities through a number of public&#13;
monopolies, and failed to maintain infrastructure and deliver basic social services. Starting&#13;
in 1986, government efforts to restore macro-economic balances and promote economic&#13;
growth were supported by the Bretton Woods institutions.  Adjustment operations&#13;
focused on strengthening the management of public finances. They also supported certain&#13;
policy improvements, particularly trade and price liberalization and public enterprise&#13;
privatization and liquidation. However, these efforts were crippled by the deteriorating&#13;
external environment marked by a significant drop in the country's terms of trade,&#13;
aggravated by an appreciation of the exchange rate. These factors led to an economic&#13;
contraction. From 1986 to 1993, real per capita income declined by about 20 percent.&#13;
1.3   While the internal adjustment strategy failed to bring about growth, it resulted in&#13;
some lasting changes.   Ambitious trade and price liberalization measures were&#13;
implemented, and the first elements of civil service reform were introduced. The number&#13;
of government employees was reduced by 11 percent between 1986 and 1991 to about&#13;
22,000. The public enterprise sector underwent extensive reform as the state's portfolio&#13;
I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Central Afrcan Republic Urban Environmental Rehabilitation Project&#13;
was reduced from 52 to 32 enterprises through liquidations and privatizations. All&#13;
commercial functions of public enterprises in the agricultural sector, including cotton&#13;
marketing, were either privatized or liquidated, while their regulatory functions were taken&#13;
over by government agencies. Interest rates were liberalized. The introduction of a three-&#13;
year rolling investment program, which resulted in the elimination of a number of non-&#13;
viable projects, marked a further--and important--element of progress.&#13;
1.4   The economic crisis led to rising social and political tensions, and eventually to the&#13;
demise of the one-party regime. Starting in 1991, the Government was no longer able to&#13;
meet its payroll obligations as tax collection collapsed. Civil service salaries were paid&#13;
only intermittently, and by end-1993 were 12 months in arrears. Prolonged strikes by civil&#13;
servants resulted in a virtual paralysis of the economy. Expenditure on goods and services&#13;
was curtailed to such an extent that government agencies no longer had the means to carry&#13;
out their tasks. The situation became particularly alarming in the health and education&#13;
sectors, with most public schools and hospitals virtually ceasing operations. Calls for&#13;
political liberalization and an end to the one-party regime multiplied. After three years of&#13;
political unrest, elections monitored by international observers took place in September&#13;
1993 and a new president was elected. He formed a coalition government with broad&#13;
political support. The new Government has affirmed its commitment to economic and&#13;
social reform. Its priority task is to rebuild the country's social and infrastructure sectors.&#13;
1.5   Recent Economic Developments. In January 1994, in concert with the other&#13;
members of the CFA franc zone, CAR devalued its currency by 50 percent in foreign&#13;
exchange terms. The Government adopted an adjustment program supported by a Stand-&#13;
by arrangement approved by the IMF in March 1994. CAR has also implemented most&#13;
trade and tax policy reforms agreed as a member of the Central African States' Customs&#13;
and Economic Union (UDEAC), including a three-tier custom tariff ranging from five to&#13;
30 percent.&#13;
1.6   The devaluation, along with the regular payment of government salaries, triggered&#13;
a significant supply response. GDP growth was seven percent in 1994 and is estimated at&#13;
3.0 percent in 1995. Average inflation for 1994 was 25 percent, lower than the 35 percent&#13;
targeted in the IMF program, and it is estimated to be about 19 percent in 1995. Cotton&#13;
and timber production has grown rapidly, neglected coffee plantations have been&#13;
rehabilitated, and livestock exports to neighboring countries have risen sharply. An IF&#13;
mission to CAR in November 1995 discussed with the authorities a set of measures to be&#13;
implemented before the resumption of discussions on a PFP and an ESAF-supported&#13;
program. On the basis of some progress in the implementation of these measures, an IMF&#13;
mission in March 1996 for Article IV consultation discussed ad-referendum with the&#13;
Government on a PFP for 1996-1999, and on a program that could be supported by an&#13;
ESAF arrangement.&#13;
B. URBAN BACKGROUND&#13;
1.7   Urban Growth. Urbanization in CAR has been accelerating since the end of the&#13;
1970s, and the role of urban markets and service centers is becoming increasingly&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Background&#13;
important in the modernization of the economy. At the time of the last census in 1988, the&#13;
urban population totaled 982,000, or 37 percent of total population. By the year 2000, it&#13;
is estimated that 44 percent of CAR's population, or an estimated 1.5 million urban&#13;
residents, will live in towns and cities. Urban growth has been fueled about equally by&#13;
natural growth, estimated at 2.5 percent, and by a rural exodus stimulated by economic&#13;
circumstances.  Starting in the mid-1980s, the decline in commodity prices and the&#13;
appreciation of the currency reduced the incentives for the production of CAR's main&#13;
exports, coffee and cotton. Coffee plantations were practically abandoned and cotton&#13;
production was reduced to a minimum. The lack of rural markets in a sparsely populated&#13;
country made the urban areas natural centers of economic activity. Urban migration has&#13;
slowed down in the last two years, mainly because of the significant supply response in the&#13;
rural areas triggered by the devaluation of the CFAF (para. 1.6). As natural population&#13;
growth is also decreasing, it is estimated that the annual growth rate of the urban&#13;
population will average about three percent until the year 2000. Yet, the role of urban&#13;
centers is expected to become increasingly critical to the shift of the economy towards the&#13;
formal and monetized sector.&#13;
1.8    Bangui's Contribution to Economic Development. In 1988, Bangui accounted&#13;
for almost half of the total urban population, or 462,000 residents. The capital's&#13;
population has grown at about 4.5 percent per annum, and is estimated in 1995 at 545,000&#13;
inhabitants in the Municipality of Bangui, and at 656,000 inhabitants in Greater Bangui,&#13;
comprising the Municipalities of Bangui and adjacent Bimbo. By the year 2000 it is&#13;
estimated that the population of Greater Bangui will amount to 748,000 inhabitants.&#13;
Given the CAR's limited resources and pattern of sparse human settlement, a reasonable&#13;
concentration of infrastructure investment is needed for Bangui to fulfill its essential trade&#13;
and service function, contribute to economic development, and ultimately serve as the&#13;
engine of growth for the country. Economies of scale can be achieved only in Bangui,&#13;
where a critical mass in terms of human potential and facilities can be provided to potential&#13;
private investors at least cost. The appropriate functioning of public service delivery and&#13;
actual capacity of the public sector to maintain basic public infrastructure in Bangui is&#13;
critical to the city's attractiveness and efficiency.&#13;
1.9    Urban traditional settlements and outdated urban master plans are major&#13;
handicaps to effective and affordable city upgrade. Settlements in Bangui, and to a&#13;
lesser extent in secondary cities, are haphazardly developed according to customary&#13;
practices without urban planning or sound infrastructure programming. Out-dated urban&#13;
development master plans of the early 1970's, still the only available reference, with&#13;
oversized standards for infrastructure improvement --paved streets and drainage systems&#13;
in the existing settlements--, have further complicated interventions in the neighborhoods&#13;
by requiring resettlement of households located in the rig'hts-of-way for drainage and&#13;
streets. Furthermore, state land management --according to the land law-- has not&#13;
allowed, in general, settlers to get a recognition of private land ownership.&#13;
1.10  Urban health issues have a severe negative impact on welfare and the&#13;
economy. Urban health issues reflect the economic and physical conditions of the cities&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Central African Republic Urban Environmental Rehabilitation Project&#13;
along with the lack of effective strategies for disease prevention and treatment. Public&#13;
health conditions are poor, as evidenced by parasitic communicable diseases including&#13;
malaria, intestinal worms and other body parasites, along with gastrointestinal illnesses,&#13;
that accounted for more than half of all illnesses reported by health centers in Bangui in&#13;
1989. Children and adolescents are the main victims: 68 percent of those seen for&#13;
diarrhea are less than four years old, 82 percent less than 15 years old, and two-thirds of&#13;
those seen for malaria are under 15 years old. Gastrointestinal illnesses are among the&#13;
leading cause of death for children, and the infant mortality rate appears to be considerably&#13;
higher in CAR than the Sub-Saharan African average: 145 vs. 114 per 1000. The spatial&#13;
distribution of gastrointestinal and parasitic diseases is closely correlated with deficiencies&#13;
of access to safe drinking water, sanitation and solid waste disposal, and the neediest&#13;
unplanned settlements of the city's northwest quarter are the most severely affected by&#13;
these illnesses.&#13;
1.11   Water supply is scarce and of poor quality. According to the 1988 census, only&#13;
29 percent of urban households had access to safe drinking water. Operation of existing&#13;
facilities has improved since the privatization of the sector in 1992:  a state-owned&#13;
Holding Company has awarded a Management Contract to a Private Company (75 percent&#13;
private-, and 25 percent state-owned) which is in charge of operation and maintenance of&#13;
the urban water supply facilities. Unaccounted for water has decreased from 45% in 1992&#13;
to 30% in 1995. Although the average daily distributed volume of potable water in&#13;
Bangui is in the acceptable range of 30 liters per capita, the house connections are still&#13;
limited to about one per 70 inhabitants, so hindering a wider access to safe drinking water.&#13;
It must be noted that the average cost of a house connection exceeds six months of the&#13;
average individual income. A way to increase access to safe drinking water is through the&#13;
construction of water kiosks in the poorer neighborhoods. There are about one hundred&#13;
such water kiosks in Bangui, all managed by private operators or community associations.&#13;
Finally, about 60 percent of the urban population, and 80 percent of the population of the&#13;
haphazard human settlements of Bangui, use shallow wells for supply of poor quality&#13;
water for non alimentary consumption. Pollution of the underground water tapped by&#13;
these shallow wells is high.  The Holding Company is preparing a project for the&#13;
strengthening and extension of the water distribution network with support of bilateral&#13;
funding from CFD, while the construction of new water kiosks, as well as improvement of&#13;
shallow wells protection, should be carried out at grassroots level in a participatory&#13;
manner in order to ensure a proper maintenance.  Hygiene and sanitary education&#13;
campaigns must also be carried out to increase general awareness on health hazards.&#13;
1.12   Sanitation is critically lacking. Nearly eight out of ten households use latrines or&#13;
rudimentary septic tanks which pollute the water table. Modern toilets are used by only&#13;
about 6 percent of households. The increase of housing density and number of latrines&#13;
within housing compounds, the proximity of the water table to the surface, and the&#13;
occasional flooding of poorly covered latrines, all contribute to the bacterial contamination&#13;
of underground water and to the spread of waterborne diseases. Technical improvements&#13;
of the currently used rudimentary latrines are possible, and should be implemented at the&#13;
community level in the neighborhoods.&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Background&#13;
1.13  Solid waste collection is very limited and unreliable. Trash pickup services are&#13;
not available to residential neighborhoods. In downtown Bangui, formal shops and some&#13;
city markets may have their trash collected provided that they pay a municipal tax, but this&#13;
service is unreliable at best. Other parts of the city and CAR's other urban areas totally&#13;
lack such services, while piles of trash accumulate in most residential areas. This situation&#13;
further contributes to non-hygienic living conditions and contamination of underground&#13;
water sources, promotes the proliferation of insects, animal scavengers and disease-&#13;
bearing mosquitoes, and hinders the flow of rainwater in drainage canals and roadside&#13;
ditches. A project receiving support from the French Cooperation (Fonds d'Aide et de&#13;
Cooperation - FAC) to address drainage in Bangui, includes a revival of trash pickup in&#13;
residential areas, for which 40 five cubic meter containers and four trucks have been&#13;
provided. Three subcontracts have been awarded by the Municipality to private operators.&#13;
The latter have received the trucks free of charge and are supposed to take care of the&#13;
containers and maintain the trucks, and may enter into private contracts for trash&#13;
collection in residential areas where they would be directly paid by users.&#13;
1.14 Drainage and roads in Bangui remain inappropriate, despite some&#13;
rehabilitation and construction works on main canals over the last four years. It is&#13;
estimated that about 15,000 houses, or about 75,000 to 100,000 residents, are subject to&#13;
recurrent flooding for ten to twenty days every year, and incur heavy yearly repair and&#13;
maintenance expenses. Bangui's primary drainage network consists of about 24 km of&#13;
main canals, but the secondary network is very poorly developed (only 10 km long).&#13;
About 15 km of drains need to be rehabilitated or constructed within the current lay-out of&#13;
built-up areas of the city. Mainly because of the inadequate drainage and lack of&#13;
maintenance, the urban roads network is in poor condition: only 38 percent of the 56 km&#13;
of paved roads, and 16 percent of the 48 km of unpaved roads, are in good condition:&#13;
during the rainy season, secondary roads are often unpassable, and access to poor&#13;
residential areas is virtually impossible to vehicles.&#13;
C. GOVERNMENT'S URBAN POLICY AND IDA SECTOR STRATEGY&#13;
1.15  Government's urban policy and strategy have materialized into a Municipal&#13;
Development Program (Programme de D&amp;veloppement Municipal - PDM) which was&#13;
presented and discussed at a urban donors' conference held in Bangui in January 1993.&#13;
Prepared with the assistance of external donors including the French Cooperation (FAC),&#13;
the Caisse Franpaise de D&amp;veloppement (CFD), the Japanese Aid (Policy and Human&#13;
Resources Development fund - PHRD), and IDA, this program has a broad scope of&#13;
activities and seeks to link explicitly urban investment and economic growth. It also&#13;
encompasses broad social issues such as the relationships between urban sanitation and&#13;
health conditions of poorer dwellers. It gave priority to basic urban works on primary&#13;
drainage network aimed at improving health and environmental conditions in Bangui to&#13;
remedy haphazard urban settlements. To maximize the social impact of these works, it&#13;
included the setting-up of an autonomous agency to contract out the works to Small and&#13;
Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The 1995-1997 triennial investment plan of the Government&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Central African Republic Urban Environmental Rehabilitation Project&#13;
is in line with the PDM's targets: improvement of the urban environment and&#13;
strengthening of municipal management.&#13;
1.16  The main objectives assigned to the urban sector by the PDM are:&#13;
(a)   restructuring of haphazard settlements, in particular via expanding drainage&#13;
works and provision of basic urban services;&#13;
(b)   monitoring of urban growth through improved urban planning, better&#13;
programming of major infrastructure and the implementation of selected&#13;
land development operations;&#13;
(c)   introduction in a progressive manner of a land market, through the&#13;
increased availability of new serviced sites to be developed in peripheral&#13;
areas;&#13;
(d)   poverty relief, through job creation and the promotion of SMEs in the&#13;
construction sector; and&#13;
(e)   setting-up of new entities aiming to finance urban investment, and to&#13;
execute infrastructure works.&#13;
1.17  The policy has started to be implemented. A non governmental agency --the&#13;
Municipal Works Agency (Agence de Travaux Communaux - ATRACOM)--, has been set&#13;
up in February 1994, and will be run along the principles of a private contract management&#13;
unit acting on behalf of the Central Government, the municipality of Bangui and local&#13;
communities at the neighborhood level. For securing the financing of urban infrastructure,&#13;
the Urban Development and Equipment Fund (Fonds d'Amenagement et d'Equipement&#13;
Urbain - FAEU) was created, in August 1995. ATRACOM and FAEU are not yet&#13;
operational, but significant progress has been made recently with the selection of the&#13;
General Manager of ATRACOM.&#13;
1.18  IDA sector strategy is to support the PDM (para 1.15) with a three pronged&#13;
approach to: (a) consolidate the capacity, first of the Housing and Regional Planning&#13;
Directorate (Direction Generale de 1'Habitat et de I'Amenagement du Territoire -&#13;
DGHAT) to coordinate and plan urban investments, and second of the Municipality of&#13;
Bangui to program investments in the city; (b) set up an autonomous agency to contract&#13;
out the works to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), thus freeing the public sector of&#13;
the burden of execution and maximizing the social impact of civil works; and (c) ensure&#13;
sustainable and appropriate funding for FAEU. The project is the outcome of a continuing&#13;
dialogue between the Government and IDA in the framework of the PDM. As the&#13;
strengthening of the planning function is supported by bilaterals, the proposed project&#13;
focuses on the private sector execution and financing dimension of the sector strategy,&#13;
through the provision of primary drainage and integrated neighborhood development. The&#13;
process of selecting components of the priority actions to be developed in the PDM with&#13;
the assistance of IDA has been the occasion to develop neighborhood organization&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Background&#13;
through NGO participation, which model a new relationship between communities and&#13;
Government.&#13;
D. URBAN INSTITUTIONS&#13;
1.19  Like most African countries, CAR is experiencing difficulties to set up its urban&#13;
management. Also, a strong tradition of centralism and public sector intervention (either&#13;
central or local) has been predominant so far: the public sector (essentially the Ministries&#13;
of Transport and Public Works) is still expected to deliver urban services, to manage the&#13;
procurement of public works centrally, to keep the land management monopoly and to&#13;
carry out land urbanization. At the end of the 1980s, CAR undertook a "deconcentration"&#13;
of central government administration. Because of a lack of transfer of resources to local&#13;
ministerial branches, the reforms achieved little results. The CAR Government embarked,&#13;
at the same time, on a decentralization scheme which should lead to a partial transfer of&#13;
responsibilities in urban management to local governments to be elected at the commune&#13;
level. Local communities (quartiers) at the neighborhoods' level are also playing an&#13;
increasing role in the improvement of the urban environment with the assistance of&#13;
International NGOs (INGO) (such as OXFAM-Quebec), which also provide advisory&#13;
services to local and central authorities on behalf of the communities.&#13;
1.20  Ministries are still in charge of urban planning, land management and urban&#13;
infrastructure programming. Because they are managing the external funds allocated to&#13;
urban development, the Ministries of Transport and of Public Works coordinate and plan&#13;
the urban investments. The Housing and Regional Planning Directorate (Direction&#13;
Generale de  'Habitat et de 1 AmMnagement du Territoire - DGHAT), in the Ministry of&#13;
Public Works, is in charge of urban planning and land management, but its activities are&#13;
hampered by a very weak capacity because of lack of human, budgetary and material&#13;
resources.&#13;
1.21  Local authorities are not able to adequately deliver the urban services. The&#13;
decentralization movement which started in 1988 has helped only to relieve central&#13;
government of tasks that it was in any case no longer able to carry out. In addition, the&#13;
share of financial resources formerly utilized by the communes is now diverted to help the&#13;
central government deal with budgetary constraints. The communes have been de facto&#13;
deprived of all financial independence, and the municipal councils elected since 1964 may&#13;
be dissolved at any time by presidential decree and replaced by appointed "special&#13;
delegations", as it was done on a number of occasions. The last municipal elections were&#13;
held in 1987.&#13;
1.22  Local Communities are being strengthened.  The subdivision of urban&#13;
communes into neighborhoods (quartiers) or wards (arrondissements), in the case of&#13;
Bangui, has not improved, contrary to expectations, the representation of a more diverse&#13;
range of local interests. Recent efforts supported by the donors' community, carried out&#13;
with the assistance of INGOs and supervised by the Ministry for Women Promotion and&#13;
National Solidarity (Direction of Community Development) have strengthened the&#13;
participation of local communities, which are now being involved in the planning process,&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Central African Republic Urban Environmental Rehabilitation Project&#13;
and made them more responsive to programs affecting their living conditions and&#13;
environment.&#13;
1.23  Institutional management development. Existing institutions will share the&#13;
task of the planning and programming of the urban development in the following&#13;
manner. The proposed project would strengthen the institutions and agencies, mentioned&#13;
below by providing training and services of consulting firms and short term experts.&#13;
DGHAT (para. 1.20) will have to build-up and enforce the regulatory framework for&#13;
urban planning in order to efficiently address the issue of haphazard urban settlements; it&#13;
will also have to give assistance to the municipalities for the revision and update of the&#13;
master plans of the cities, in particular in the case of Bangui. DGHAT will also need to&#13;
participate in the programming of urban infrastructure development and maintenance, as&#13;
one of the stakeholders of the FAEU (para. 1.17) along with the municipality. This fund&#13;
should progressively evolve toward an autonomous legal status allowing the involvement&#13;
of the users and beneficiaries of the private sector. The municipality of Bangui should&#13;
be assigned the role of programming the yearly investment and maintenance plans, while&#13;
providing basic local services through the improvement of its financial capacity based on&#13;
better tax and user fees collection. The municipality should also be responsible of the&#13;
enforcement of urban regulation prepared at the central level. Finally ATRACOM (para.&#13;
1.17) will be assigned the role of contracting out works related to the investment and&#13;
maintenance programs, and services financed by municipal resources, so allowing the&#13;
central and local urban institutions to carry out their planning and programming activities&#13;
without the burden of the execution and supervision tasks.&#13;
E. URBAN FINANCE&#13;
1.24  Urban growth has not been matched by urban investment. Investment in&#13;
basic urban infrastructure is mainly public and donor-financed, with the construction of a&#13;
network of primary urban roads (about 100 km), the rehabilitation and extension of a few&#13;
major drains, financed by the French Cooperation (Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation -&#13;
FAC), and the construction/rehabilitation of market places in Bangui and secondary cities&#13;
under financing of the French Development Agency (Caisse Fran,aise de Developpement&#13;
- CFD). Average public investments in urban infrastructure in the last five years is about 1&#13;
billion CFAF per year, or less than US$3 per capita. This amount represents about three&#13;
percent of the overall public investment, budgeted in 1994, while the transport&#13;
infrastructure sector accounts for 38 percent. The urban public assets are deteriorating&#13;
rapidly because of lack of maintenance. In particular, the drainage system is insufficient&#13;
and subject to clogging and erosion, which has a major impact in Bangui where rain is&#13;
abundant and natural drainage difficult in the area where the city extends.  Private&#13;
investments in urban infrastructure is negligible and mainly consists of in kind or monetary&#13;
contributions to path rehabilitation in the neighborhoods.&#13;
1.25  Municipal Finance. Since 1984 communes have relied on two types of income:&#13;
indirect taxes collected locally by central government staff and then transferred back to the&#13;
commune, and central government subsidies. Collection of local taxes is very inefficient,&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Background&#13;
recovering only 50 to 60 percent of budgeted resources. The government subsidy is&#13;
composed of a block grant and a number of other specific grants linked to payment of&#13;
salaries or to other specific operating expenses. These subsidies represent between 50 and&#13;
75 percent of a commune's income, and account for 90 percent of Government's&#13;
contribution to communes' resources.&#13;
1.26  In the last decade (1985-1995) budgeted resources for the Municipality of Bangui&#13;
have remained around an average CFAF 500,000,000 (US$1.0 million) in current&#13;
monetary terms, resulting in a dramatic deterioration in real terms, especially since the&#13;
devaluation of the CFAF. Moreover, performance in municipal budget execution has&#13;
worsened during this period of time. Actual revenues--mainly transfers from the central&#13;
government, either block grant or fiscal resources-- have been far below what was&#13;
expected, and routine expenditures, which represent the bulk of total expenditures and are&#13;
mostly made of salaries, have not adjusted accordingly, though decreasing sharply. Block&#13;
grant transfers (budgeted and actual) from the central to the local government of Bangui,&#13;
that are aimed at covering the bulk of routine expenditures, have been cut dramatically as&#13;
a consequence of the deteriorating financial situation of the State. In the absence of local&#13;
fiscal resources (except fees on market places) to make-up the difference, the gap between&#13;
actual municipal expenditures and revenues has been growing. No savings could be made&#13;
out of the routine budget. The municipal investment capacity has remained extremely low,&#13;
below CFAF 40,000,000 (US$80,000) or 6% of the total municipal budget and obviously&#13;
does not match the needs of a city whose population grows at 3 to 4% per year. In this&#13;
context, local taxation that is envisaged will be hard to implement if not accompanied by&#13;
visible and physical improvement of living conditions in the neighborhoods.&#13;
1.27  The FAC and the project preparatory activities are currently assisting reforms&#13;
towards improved fiscal management, more financial autonomy and streamlined municipal&#13;
organization in Bangui. Concrete results on the conditions of the Municipality of Bangui&#13;
already include:  reduction in personnel and payroll, computerization of services,&#13;
organizational restructuring, training of key personnel, and privatization of some services.&#13;
Further improvements are expected, in particular through increased contracting of public&#13;
works and services delivery. However, given the current financial situation of the city,&#13;
and the low fiscal potential and willingness to pay taxes, no substantial contribution to&#13;
public investment can be expected in the short and medium terms from the local&#13;
government, and urban investment should basically rely on the central government's&#13;
transfer of funds.&#13;
1.28 The main objective of the Road Fund (RF) is to ensure sustainable financing&#13;
of periodic and recurrent road maintenance including main urban roads. The main&#13;
resource available to the RF is a road users' tax (Redevance d'Usage Routier - RUR)&#13;
calculated at a rate of 55 CFAF/liter of fuel sold. This tax is received by PETROCA (the&#13;
Central African enterprise that has the monopoly for distribution of oil products) and&#13;
transferred to the RF. The RUR collected in 1994 amounted to 2.1 billion CFAF and is&#13;
estimated to be CFAF 2.4 billion in 1995. The economic situation may result in an initial&#13;
drop in the RUR collected for 1996, bringing it down to CFAF 2.1 billion. From 1997&#13;
onwards, economic growth projections assume that the fuel consumption would grow by&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Central African Republic Urban Environmental Rehabilitation Project&#13;
5 percent annually, and the RF is expected to receive CFAF 2.3 billion in 1997 and 2.4&#13;
billion in 1998. It is estimated that about 40 percent of the RUR is collected from urban&#13;
road users in Bangui.&#13;
1.29  The RF was established in 1981 as a public enterprise, under the Ministry of Public&#13;
Works, to manage the resources available for road maintenance. During preparation of&#13;
the Transport Sector Project in 1991, the role and responsibility of the road fund was&#13;
redefined stressing that the Fund was to operate as a financial intermediary responsible for&#13;
funding only road maintenance. Over the years the structure of the Fund became&#13;
cumbersome (about 70 stafi), its expenses exceeding its revenues to the point of making it&#13;
a loss making entity, and its revenues were used for other purposes than road maintenance&#13;
by the Government. In January 1996, the Government, recognizing the problems facing&#13;
maintenance of road works, and following the donors recommendations to restructure the&#13;
Fund, organized a seminar to review and recommend ways to streamline the Fund's&#13;
operations. Recommendations of the seminar once again highlighted the fact that the&#13;
Fund should act only as a financial intermediary with minimal operating expenditures and&#13;
that its sole responsibility was to finance road maintenance work. The Government has&#13;
responded favorably and has agreed to discuss and adopt the recommendations and the&#13;
action plan for their implementation at a meeting of the Council of Ministers.&#13;
1.30 The Urban Development and Equipment Fund will secure the financing of&#13;
capital expenditures and maintenance costs in urban infrastructure, the Urban&#13;
Development and Equipment Fund (Fonds d'Amenagement et d'Equipement Urbain -&#13;
FAEU) was created by the Law No 94/004 of May 24, 1994. The Presidential Decree&#13;
that defines the organization and the operation of FAEU is presented in Annex G.&#13;
Resources to be made available for this FAEU include 5 percent of the revenues of the&#13;
Road Fund, equivalent to CFAF 120 million (US$240,000) by 1998, and other fiscal&#13;
resources.  It will cover in particular the maintenance costs of urban infrastructure&#13;
rehabilitated or built under the proposed project.&#13;
1.31  Objectives of PDM  are to induce reasonable investment and maintenance&#13;
financing requirements. According to standards applied to similar countries, a yearly&#13;
average per capita investment in basic urban infrastructure equal to about 2.5 percent of&#13;
the average urban per capita revenues (US$9 in Bangui and US$7 in secondary cities)&#13;
would be needed in CAR. Therefore, the investment in urban infrastructure to provide&#13;
basic water supply, sanitation, drainage and roads to the forecasted urban population of&#13;
1.5 million in the year 2000, is about US$12 million per year. The annual incremental&#13;
routine maintenance costs of urban basic infrastructure, estimated at one percent of the&#13;
investments, would amount to US$120,000, reaching a yearly cost of US$600,000 and&#13;
US$1.2 million respectively after five and ten years. The current needs of Bangui, which&#13;
accounts for half of the urban population, would amount to approximately US$70 million&#13;
to be invested in basic urban infrastructure over the next ten years, generating additional&#13;
yearly maintenance costs of about US$70,000 at the end of the period. Although the&#13;
capacity to implement such investments will be limited by the institutional weakness and&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Background&#13;
poor execution capacity, the objectives of PDM are reasonable given the country overall&#13;
development.&#13;
1.32  Urban Finance Perspectives. With the exception of new urban extension where&#13;
the sale of plots would allow a cost recovery mechanism, the financing of new basic&#13;
urban infrastructure investments will most likely continue to rely upon resources of&#13;
external Donors, such as CFD, the European Union and IDA, and will have to be&#13;
assessed periodically in relation to the overall development needs of the country. The&#13;
financing of routine maintenance of urban infrastructure should be provided by resources&#13;
of the FAEU in the short and medium terms. As the resources of this fund are estimated&#13;
at US$240,000 by the year 1998 (para. 1.30), it will be necessary to re-assess periodically&#13;
the amount and percentage to be transferred from the RF to the FAEU, according to the&#13;
urban needs and the percentage of RF resources collected in urban areas. In the long term,&#13;
as the administrative capability of the Municipality of Bangui will be strengthened with the&#13;
assistance provided by Bilaterals and the proposed project, a new taxation basis will need&#13;
to be defined and implemented. The dialogue on development options of presently almost&#13;
non-existent Bangui's fiscal resources and capability to spend them efficiently, has been&#13;
started during project preparation and wil! be continued during execution of the proposed&#13;
project. By 1998 the Government will discuss and agree with IDA on the desirable goals&#13;
for the development of urban finance and on a medium term program for public&#13;
expenditures in the urban areas (para. 5.2k). Notably, the financing of routine&#13;
infrastructure maintenance and basic services delivery should be achieved by the&#13;
municipality of Bangui.&#13;
F. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.33  Lessons learned from  Past Experience.  The last structural Adjustment&#13;
Operation (SAC III Cr. 2162-CF) faltered in the face of heightened social and political&#13;
unrest. The program supported by the operation was too ambitious and did not establish&#13;
priorities among objectives and among measures. In sector operations common and&#13;
recurrent implementation problems have been or are: (a) weak implementation capacity,&#13;
especially related to a high turnover of executive staff; (b) lack of counterpart funds; (c)&#13;
a too ambitious project design; and (d) weak financial management capacity. These issues&#13;
have been addressed by incorporating in the design of the proposed project the following&#13;
features: (i) training of key personnel previously selected on the basis of qualification and&#13;
experience satisfactory to IDA; (ii) reduction of counterpart funds allocation, which will&#13;
be required only for payment of national personnel and office costs; (iii) simple project&#13;
design, limited to basic urban infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion; and (iv) the&#13;
requirement to recruit well-trained accountants from the private sector to operate within&#13;
the entities in charge of the project management.&#13;
1.34  The proposed project would be the first direct involvement of IDA in CAR's urban&#13;
sector. However, the experience of similar operations in the Region led to the design of&#13;
the implementation scheme of the project, around a Works Executing Agency of the&#13;
AGETIP kind. Moreover, the lessons about the critical importance of ownership and&#13;
adequate sector policy have been taken into account. The project is the outcome of a long&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Central African Republic Urban Environmental Rehabilitation Project&#13;
policy dialogue between CAR Government and IDA about the urban sector strategy,&#13;
during which the Government's, communities', and Donors'commitment to the PDM has&#13;
been established.&#13;
1.35 Rationale for IDA Involvement. IDA strategy is to provide CAR Government&#13;
with selective support to aspects of the PDM which are consistent with and contribute to&#13;
the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) --discussed by the Board on May 19, 1992. The&#13;
CAS focuses on the five areas of (i) restoring competitiveness, (ii) leading growth by&#13;
private investment, (iii) adopting a long term strategy to build capacity in the public&#13;
sector, (iv) developing human resources, and (v) protecting the environment. The PDM is&#13;
consistent with the CAS, and IDA support is limited to components of the PDM not&#13;
already included in other Donors' programs and that directly contribute to urban poverty&#13;
alleviation: the poverty focus is ensured through the rehabilitation of the urban&#13;
environment along approaches and methods which improve public health through better&#13;
drainage and sanitation systems, generate employment for unskilled workers in the&#13;
construction sector, and foster community-based improvement of living conditions in&#13;
lower-income neighborhoods.  Bilaterals (the French, the German and the Japanese&#13;
mainly) are supporting other components of the PDM, dealing with the decentralization,&#13;
fiscal and financial reforms, sector management and service delivery through streamlined&#13;
organization of the municipalities.  However, for the municipal adjustment to be&#13;
successful, a significant amount of externally financed labor-based rehabilitation and&#13;
services is needed to create job opportunities, restore public confidence in the city&#13;
government and lay the basis for resumption of tax collection; use of IDA resources&#13;
through the proposed project will therefore maximize the urban sector improvements&#13;
sought by the PDM.&#13;

The Project&#13;
2.   THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.1   Project's Preparation. A Project Preparation Facility (PPF) has been granted by&#13;
IDA in 1990, and extended in 1994 and 1995, to finance, together with CFD and FAC,&#13;
preparatory studies and pilot projects in urban expansion carried out by Agence des&#13;
Travaux Pilotes (ATRAPIL). Two PHRD grants have also been awarded for preparatory&#13;
activity, and to assist the Government in identifying the project's components and&#13;
preparing the necessary basic cartography needed for a swift start up of the project. The&#13;
whole project preparation is based on master plans and long term studies, and on&#13;
preliminary identification of components. Therefore, final design and tender document&#13;
preparation are needed for all components.&#13;
2.2   Project Objectives. IDA sector strategy is to support the PDM with a three&#13;
prong approach: (a) consolidate the capacity, first of DGHAT to coordinate and plan&#13;
urban investments, and second of the Municipality of Bangui to program investments in&#13;
the city; (b) set up an autonomous agency to contract out the works to Small and Medium&#13;
Enterprises (SMEs), thus freeing the public sector of the burden of execution and&#13;
maximizing the social impact of civil works; and (c) build on the success of the Road Fund&#13;
and ensure sustainable and appropriate funding for FAEU. As the strengthening of the&#13;
planning function is supported by Bilaterals, the project focuses on the private sector&#13;
execution and financing dimension of the sector strategy, through the provision of primary&#13;
drainage and integrated neighborhood development. The immediate objectives of the&#13;
project are: (a) to finance priority investments in Bangui which will contribute to alleviate&#13;
chronic flooding in the city -to which the poor are particularly vulnerable- and improve&#13;
the living conditions of the lower income neighborhoods by: (i) participating in the&#13;
Government's efforts to rehabilitate the main infrastructure by improving primary drainage,&#13;
and (ii) improving and expanding water supply and sanitary facilities, secondary and&#13;
tertiary drainage and street infrastructure in selected neighborhoods; and (b) to promote&#13;
the development of the private sector, especially SMEs, in the construction industry by&#13;
executing most of the works through an efficient executing agency. This agency would be&#13;
able to process payments rapidly, and create employment for unskilled workers, thus&#13;
generating income for disadvantaged residents by using labor-intensive construction&#13;
techniques. The long-term objective of the project is to promote an integrated and&#13;
participatory development of Bangui--replicable in other cities--by developing appropriate&#13;
mechanisms of dialogue and participation between the population and the Government at&#13;
its different levels.&#13;
2.3   Project Description. The project has the following components:&#13;
(a)   Rehabilitation and extension of the main drainage system of the city of&#13;
Bangui (US$6.0 million), including (i) rehabilitation, protection and extension of the two&#13;
central canals of Bouagba and Kouanga; (ii) rehabilitation of under-designed and unsound&#13;
structures, and construction of new culverts; (iii) rehabilitation of shoulders and side&#13;
ditches of the primary network; (iv) detailed engineering and supervision for these works;&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Central African Republic Urban Environmental Rehabilitaiion Project&#13;
and, (v) pilot projects for low cost appropriate technology for lining and paving of canals&#13;
by means of masonry, wooden piles, or sheet piling.&#13;
(b)   Integrated and participatory neighborhood development (US$5.0 million),&#13;
including: (i) sensitization, establishment of community development committees, and&#13;
health and hygiene education campaigns; (ii) improvement of shallow wells and latrines,&#13;
construction of water kiosks and water connections for community buildings; (iii)&#13;
upgrading secondary and tertiary drainage and street networks, and, on a pilot basis,&#13;
rehabilitation of secondary markets and other community infrastructure, such as primary&#13;
health care centers, schools, community centers; and (iv) pre-collection of solid wastes at&#13;
the community level. The selected neighborhoods are N'Gouciment and Malimaka, for a&#13;
total area of about 300 ha and a population estimated at 50,000 inhabitants.  The&#13;
upgrading of the tertiary drainage and streets networks will be carried out with the&#13;
participation of the concerned population, either in kind or financial, according to&#13;
modalities to be established during the sensitization activities.&#13;
(c)   Resettlement (US$0.6 million), of an estimated 150 households, the dwellings of&#13;
which are built on right-of-ways of main canals or secondary streets and canals in the&#13;
neighborhoods. Resettlement operations, including construction of new houses, will be&#13;
carried out according to procedures and action plans developed in a participatory manner&#13;
with the interested population and mutually agreed upon by the Government and IDA, as&#13;
agreed before negotiation of the Credit (para. 5.1). The enactment of the law defining the&#13;
general procedural framework for involuntary resettlement is a condition of Board&#13;
presentation (para. 5.3).&#13;
(d)   Studies (US$0.9 million), including the update of the urban development plan of&#13;
the western extension area of the city, including streets and drainage networks and&#13;
environmental mitigation measures, update of the hydraulics and engineering studies of the&#13;
central drainage system (Bouagba and Kouanga canals), solid waste collection&#13;
management and sanitary landfill preliminary study, and community development and&#13;
hygiene and health sensitization.&#13;
(e)   Institutional Support (US$3.6 million), including training, short term Technical&#13;
Assistance, supply of vehicles and equipment, and incremental operating costs of&#13;
Government Agencies involved in the execution of the project, namely the General&#13;
Directorate for Habitat and Land Development (DGHAT), the Steering Committee (MPS)&#13;
in charge of the coordination of the project's activities, the Municipality of Bangui, and&#13;
the Directorate for Community Development (DDC). This component will also cover the&#13;
first year of operations, until June 1997, on the basis of an agreed upon budget of&#13;
ATRACOM, (US$0.3 million), the executing agency to which management of final&#13;
design, supervision and works will be delegated, as it is expected, and has been confirmed&#13;
during negotiations (para 5.2), that in subsequent years ATRACOM will cover its&#13;
expenses by charging no more than 5 to 6 percent on the amount of the contracts it&#13;
manages (US$0.5 million), as it is the practice of other similar agencies.&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project&#13;
B. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
2.4   The total project cost is estimated at CFAF 10.4 billion (US$20.9 million) before&#13;
taxes, of which US$10.4 million, or approximately 49.7 percent, represent the foreign&#13;
exchange component. Base costs are expressed in prices of August 1995. The total cost&#13;
includes refinancing of the IDA PPF of US$1.6 million. Costs of works were estimated&#13;
on the basis of consultants' studies and recent bid prices and quotations for similar works&#13;
and supplies. Taxes have been estimated at ten percent of local costs. They amount to&#13;
CFAF 524.3 million (US$1.0 million).&#13;
2.5   Physical contingencies have been estimated at: 20 percent for works, final&#13;
engineering and supervision, 15 percent for pilot projects, and 10 percent for general&#13;
studies and institutional support. Since the volume of works within the Integrated and&#13;
Participatory Neighborhood Development will be adjusted according to available funds, no&#13;
physical contingencies have been applied to this component. The total amount of physical&#13;
contingencies, US$1.8 million, represents 10.2 percent of total base costs.  Price&#13;
contingencies have been added to base costs plus physical contingencies.  Price&#13;
contingencies are based on recent estimates of local and foreign inflations as follows:&#13;
Inflation Rates&#13;
1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001&#13;
Local                 3.4%  3.0%  3.0%  3.0%  3.0%  3.0%&#13;
Foreign               3.3%  2.3%  2.5%  2.5%  2.5%  2.5%.&#13;
2.6   The project would be financed by : (a) an IDA credit of US$18.8 million, or 90.1&#13;
percent of total cost; and (b) a counterpart contribution from the Government of US$2.1&#13;
million, or 9.9 percent of total cost, to cover personnel and offices' costs. It is estimated&#13;
that contributions in kind from beneficiaries would amount to US$1.2 million.&#13;
2.7   The project cost estimates by component is summarized in table 1.1 below, and&#13;
detailed in Annex A.&#13;

3. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. EXECUTION OF THE PROJECT&#13;
3.1   The Steering Committee (MPS) will be in charge of the general coordination of the&#13;
project, of management of the general studies, of the integrated and participatory&#13;
neighborhood development, and of the resettlement operations, while delegating to&#13;
ATRACOM the execution of final design, supervision and works. Members of the MPS&#13;
will be the representatives of all Government agencies involved in the project, namely&#13;
DGHAT, DDC, and the Municipality of Bangui.  Representatives of NGOs and&#13;
community development grassroots organizations will be also associated as members into&#13;
the MPS. MPS and its permanent Coordinator have been established by Ministerial decree&#13;
in August 1995 (see Annexes H and I). It has been confirmed during negotiations that the&#13;
MPS will be maintained with qualified staff in adequate number, and that the coordinator&#13;
shall have qualification and experience satisfactory to IDA during all project&#13;
implementation (para. 5.2).&#13;
3.2   In order to facilitate the awarding of civil works contracts to local SMEs, the CAR&#13;
authorities have created in February 1994 (Annex F) an autonomous executing agency,&#13;
ATRACOM, which is similar to the other agencies of AGETIP-kind created in Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa during the last years. ATRACOM has been established taking stock of the&#13;
experience of ATRAPIL (Agence de Travaux Pilote), which was funded under the IDA&#13;
PPF, and was tested during 1994 for pilot works of right-of-way opening and land&#13;
development operations in the neighborhood of Pelemongo, a western suburb of Bangui,&#13;
allowing to build knowledge of management of this kind of operations. ATRACOM will&#13;
be operated under the aegis of commercial law, ensuring prompt payment of consultants&#13;
and contractors, as agreed upon with Government during negotiations (para 5.2), with a&#13;
minimum of technical assistance, mainly provided by other similar agencies in the region&#13;
and will be remunerated, after the first year of operations, on the basis of services&#13;
rendered. The size of its staff, recruited on fixed-term contracts, will be adapted to the&#13;
volume of activity being executed. It will use simple and rapid procedures for bidding&#13;
invitations, contract award, and payment (from a Special Account) of consultants and&#13;
contractors--crucial conditions for the participation of small enterprises with limited&#13;
financial resources. ATRACOM will be the project's executing agency for works and&#13;
related studies and supervision. The experience of similar agencies has shown them to be&#13;
powerful instruments with important spin-off effects on project implementation. Being&#13;
established as a private, not-for-profit company, ATRACOM's mission would be to&#13;
undertake "general contracting" of urban infrastructure works for municipalities, ministries&#13;
and other entities. ATRACOM would hire, and supervise, consultants to prepare the&#13;
technical and bidding documents; it will issue the call for bids, evaluate and adjudicate the&#13;
bids and enter into contracts with consultants and contractors; using both consultants and&#13;
its own engineers, it will supervise the works, evaluate progress and make payments to&#13;
consultants and contractors; finally, it will undertake the commissioning of the works and&#13;
hand them over to the Municipality of Bangui for operation and maintenance. During&#13;
negotiations it was confirmed that ATRACOM's operations will be regulated by its&#13;
Procedures Manual, that sets out in detail each step of the process (para. 5.2). Also&#13;
17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Central African Republic Urban Environmental Rehabilitation Project&#13;
during negotiations, agreement with the Government has been reached to maintain&#13;
ATRACOM during the implementation of the project, with a General Manager whose&#13;
qualifications and experience shall be satisfactory to IDA (para. 5.2). A General Manager&#13;
for ATRACOM has already been selected with the no-objection of IDA. The draft by-&#13;
laws of ATRACOM, and the signed contract of the General Manager, have been&#13;
submitted by the Government prior to negotiations (para 5.1). Finally, the execution of a&#13;
subsidiary grant agreement between the Government and ATRACOM under terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to IDA for conveying to ATRACOM functional responsibility&#13;
pertaining to the execution of works is a condition of effectiveness of the Credit (para.&#13;
5.4).&#13;
3.3   Each year, a program of projects would be established and agreed with the MPS&#13;
and IDA, and regular progress reports on the execution of the work program will be&#13;
submitted to IDA and to the Government by the last day of each calendar quarter.&#13;
Independent audits would be carried out every six months for ATRACOM and every year&#13;
for MPS. These procedures have been confirmed during negotiations (para 5.2).&#13;
3.4   ATRACOM would be responsible for selecting technical options for carrying out&#13;
the works and for contracting out preliminary and detailed engineering services. Annual&#13;
work programs would be submitted for approval to MPS, prior to seeking IDA no-&#13;
objection. ATRACOM would be responsible for contracting for works included in the&#13;
approved programs and supervising their execution. All requests for bids must conform to&#13;
standards agreed with IDA during negotiations (para 5.2). Works using labor-intensive&#13;
techniques will be packaged in lots of between CFAF 10 and 50 million in order to&#13;
facilitate participation by SMEs.&#13;
3.5   Resettlement. Specific procedures for resettlement operations under the project,&#13;
as well as a specific action plan for the Malimaka neighborhood, have been developed&#13;
during the preparation phase of the project, with the participation of  interested&#13;
households organized with the assistance of an international NGO (OXFAM-Quebec).&#13;
These procedures have been reviewed, and agreed upon by Government and IDA before&#13;
negotiations (para. 5.1). Resettlement costs are included in the project. All resettlement&#13;
operations will be managed and supervised by an independent ad-hoc entity to be&#13;
specifically contracted for this task, while all works which can be contracted out will be&#13;
managed by ATRACOM.&#13;
3.6   Indicators. Monitorable input, output, outcome and impact indicators will be&#13;
based upon a year-by-year project work plan that will lay out, by quarter, the main&#13;
physical implementation targets as well as budgetary expenditure targets. Such an overall&#13;
work plan will be updated at least once a year by the end of the second quarter.&#13;
Monitoring will involve the comparison of actual performance with target levels of&#13;
selected indicators. MPS will be responsible for collecting and processing the monitoring&#13;
data and for preparing quarterly progress reports. In most cases, the information will be&#13;
directly available from ATRACOM. Proposed indicators are presented in Annex K. The&#13;
indicators and the reporting format have been agreed upon during negotiations (para 5.2).&#13;
18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Implementation&#13;
B. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.7   During negotiations (para 5.2), Government has provided assurances that it will&#13;
adopt standard IDA procurement procedures and arrangements outlined below, and that&#13;
standard bidding documents for works and goods under ICB, IDA forms for consultants'&#13;
contracts for complex time-based assignments or lump sum remuneration as applicable,&#13;
and model letter of invitation for consultants will be used throughout the proposed&#13;
project. Also, during negotiations, (para. 5.2) agreement with the Government has been&#13;
reached on the standard procurement processing time for main procurement activities and&#13;
on a time table to finalize the standard bidding documents for goods, works and consulting&#13;
services.&#13;
3.8   Works. ATRACOM will subdivide the works programs into contract packages&#13;
incorporating design for labor-intensive construction methods (subject to IDA review) to&#13;
encourage participation by SMEs which would meet the appropriate standards of&#13;
performance. All works contracts for amounts up to US$250,000 equivalent each (for a&#13;
total aggregate estimated at about US$3.8 million) would be subject to NCB procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA, which include, at the minimum: local advertising, public bid opening,&#13;
transparent evaluation criteria, award to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder and non-&#13;
exclusion of foreign bidders. The bidding procedure would be advertised in local&#13;
newspapers permitting not less than 30 days bidding time. A sample bidding document&#13;
would be reviewed prior to solicitation of the first NCB procurement, and the approved&#13;
document would be used for subsequent NCB.  All works contracts for amounts&#13;
exceeding US$250,000 would be subject to ICB procedures in accordance with IDA&#13;
Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995). A&#13;
preferential margin of 7.5 percent will be given to domestic contractors in accordance with&#13;
IDA guidelines.  Contracts for small works up to a total aggregated amount of&#13;
US$30,000, and works related to resettlement operations, which will be spread over time&#13;
and space, would be procured under lump-sum fixed price contracts, by obtaining three&#13;
quotations from qualified domestic contractors.  These contracts may also involve&#13;
participation of beneficiaries, and will not exceed US$40,000 per contract up to an&#13;
aggregate estimated cost of at US$810,000.&#13;
3.9   Goods and Equipment. Vehicles, barrows and tools for solid waste removal,&#13;
office supplies and equipment, including computers, telecommunication equipment,&#13;
printing equipment and furniture, for amounts up to US$50,000, and a total aggregated&#13;
amount estimated at US$150,000 will be subject to NCB procedures as described above in&#13;
para 3.8. All purchases for amounts exceeding US$50,000 will be subject to ICB&#13;
procedures in accordance with IDA Guidelines. Purchases of vehicles, goods and&#13;
equipment, and office supplies of implementing agencies, for amounts up to US$15,000&#13;
per contract, and an aggregated amount estimated at US$150,000, will be subject to&#13;
national shopping (NS) or may be acquired through the International Agencies&#13;
Procurement Service Office (IAPSO).&#13;

3.10  Consulting Services.   Consulting services, comprising studies and works&#13;
supervision, training and short-term technical assistance, and auditing, will be procured&#13;
according to IDA Guidelines for Use of Consultants (August 1981). Details are provided&#13;
in Annexes C and D.&#13;
3.11  Review. For contracts for civil works under ICB procurement, estimated to cost&#13;
more than US$250,000 equivalent each, the bidding documents, advertisements,&#13;
advertising procedures, bid evaluation procedures and proposed contract awards will be&#13;
reviewed by IDA prior to solicitation of bids and award of contracts. The first five NCB&#13;
civil works procurement will also be subject to prior review. Subsequently, only NCB&#13;
procurement for civil works exceeding US$150,000 will be subject to prior review.&#13;
Purchases of goods and equipment exceeding US$50,000 will be subject to prior review.&#13;
Consultants contracts with individuals up to an amount of US$20,000 each and with firms&#13;
up to an amount of US$75,000 each will be subject to post review procedures except for&#13;
terms of reference, assignments of a critical nature and amendments of contracts bringing&#13;
the contract amount above the thresholds indicated above. Post review procedures will be&#13;
applied in the other instances, where expenditures are made out of certified SOEs, and&#13;
documentation will be retained at the executing agencies for random review by IDA staff&#13;
and for periodic audits. In addition, special monitoring will be introduced by requesting&#13;
quarterly progress reports on procurement status. Training programs will also be subject&#13;
to IDA prior review. Before agreeing to any material modification or waiver of contract&#13;
terms and conditions that would increase contract cost by more than 15 percent of the&#13;
original price, the Borrower should inform IDA of the proposed modification and reasons&#13;
therefore.&#13;

3.13   Special Accounts. To facilitate disbursement, the amounts of US$0.25 million&#13;
equivalent and US$0.5 million equivalent, both denominated in CFAF, will be advanced&#13;
from the IDA credit and deposited into two Special Accounts, opened in a local&#13;
commercial bank on behalf of MPS and ATRACOM respectively. The amounts are&#13;
estimated to cover about four months of expenditures. The Special Accounts will be&#13;
replenished through the submission of fully documented withdrawal applications to IDA.&#13;
However, expenses related to contracts valued at less than US$50,000 equivalent each&#13;
will be reimbursed against certified Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) from the Special&#13;
Accounts, for which documentation will be retained at the executing agencies for post&#13;
review by IDA staff during supervision missions and for regular semi-annual audits.&#13;
22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Implementation&#13;
Reimbursement applications submitted against the two accounts will include a bank&#13;
statement showing account activity since the last application, with the balance certified by&#13;
the bank holding the accounts, and a reconciliation statement. MPS and ATRACOM will&#13;
submit replenishment requests for the Special Accounts to IDA on a monthly basis, or&#13;
whenever the accounts are diminished by US$50,000 and US$100,000 respectively,&#13;
whichever comes first. The opening and operation of the two Special Accounts have been&#13;
agreed upon with the Government during negotiations (para. 5.2).&#13;
D. ACCOUNTING, AUDITING AND REPORTING&#13;
3.14   WPS and ATRACOM will maintain, to the satisfaction of IDA, separate accounts&#13;
and records to be used exclusively for the project.  All project related receipts and&#13;
expenditures will be grouped together by project component and will be recorded in&#13;
accordance with consistently applied accounting principles and procedures. Beginning in&#13;
1997, MPS and ATRACOM will furnish to IDA, as soon as available, but no later than 4&#13;
months after the end of each fiscal year (April 30th) for MPS, and no later than 4 months&#13;
after the end of each reporting period (April 30th and October 31st) for ATRACOM,&#13;
audited financial statements, including separate audit of the SOE and the special account.&#13;
The audit report should be prepared by independent auditors, acceptable to IDA. The&#13;
terms of reference for the appointment of auditors have been discussed with the&#13;
Government during negotiations (para. 5.2), and the appointment of auditors with&#13;
qualifications and experience acceptable to IDA constitutes a condition of Credit&#13;
Effectiveness (para. 5.4). In addition to annual audit reports, the executing agency will&#13;
prepare quarterly progress reports following a format discussed during negotiations (para.&#13;
5.2). These reports will be due to the Bank within one month after the end of each&#13;
quarter, at the latest.&#13;
E. SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
3.15  Routine supervision missions should normally include a civil engineer or an urban&#13;
planner, and a financial analyst. Full scale missions, to be carried out at least once a year,&#13;
should also include a procurement specialist, a community participation specialist, and a&#13;
resettlement specialist. The number of Bank Group staffweeks required for supervision is&#13;
20 for the first year and 16 to 18 for each subsequent year. Initial supervision missions&#13;
should take place at least every four months and pay special attention to the performance&#13;
of the implementing agencies, MPS and ATRACOM, with respect to procurement, i.e.,&#13;
time required to issue bidding invitations, select the winning bid, sign contracts and pay&#13;
invoice; conformity with Bank procurement procedures, and ability to anticipate and deal&#13;
with cost overruns, especially in civil works (ATRACOM's responsibility). Supervision&#13;
missions should also scrutinize MPS and ATRACOM operating costs. Detailed&#13;
arrangements are spelled out in the Project's Implementation Manual, the draft of which&#13;
has been discussed during negotiations (para 5.2).  The adoption of the Project's&#13;
Implementation Manual is a condition of effectiveness of the Credit (para. 5.4).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Central African Republic Urban Environmental Rehabilitation Project&#13;
3.16  For the purpose of easy supervision, during negotiations (para 5.2), a list of key&#13;
input, output, outcome and impact indicators (para. 3.6 and Annex K) have been agreed&#13;
upon by IDA and the Government. An assessment of performance by indicator will be&#13;
attached to the quarterly progress reports that MPS and ATRACOM are required to&#13;
submit to IDA no later than one month after the end of the quarter. Quarterly progress&#13;
reports to be forwarded to IDA shall also include status of procurement. IDA supervision&#13;
missions shall review contributions by Government and beneficiaries to the project.&#13;
Should the Government fail to provide the project with the foreseen in kind counterpart,&#13;
according to modalities agreed during negotiations, continuation of the annual program of&#13;
works would be delayed until the contributions are provided to the project. As agreed&#13;
upon during negotiations (para. 5.2), annual programs of works will be defined by mutual&#13;
agreement of Government and IDA.&#13;
3.17 The Government and IDA shall conduct, not later than December 31, 1998, a mid-&#13;
term project implementation review in order to: (a) monitor progress in carrying out the&#13;
project and performance of the executing agencies under the respective agreements; (b)&#13;
discuss and agree on studies and programs identified during project implementation as&#13;
well as procurement and financing related to the rest of such studies and programs; (c)&#13;
discuss and agree on: (i) the desirable goals for the development of Bangui's urban&#13;
finance--which taxes would need to be established, and over which time frame; and (ii) a&#13;
medium term program for public expenditures in the urban areas; (d) discuss the amount&#13;
and percentage of funds to be transferred from the RF to the FAEU, and agree on&#13;
appropriate modifications thereof; and (e) propose coordinated solutions to any&#13;
outstanding issue.&#13;
3.18 To prepare for such a review, the Government shall require MIPS and ATRACOM&#13;
to employ independent consultants, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, to carry&#13;
out an evaluation of activities completed by August 31, 1998. No later than October 15,&#13;
1998, the Government shall furnish to IDA for its review and comments the report&#13;
prepared by the consultants, including the comments of the executing agencies and the&#13;
Government itself The report shall be submitted in such detail as IDA shall reasonably&#13;
request, and shall agree upon with the Government no later than December 31, 1997. It&#13;
will include: (a) an evaluation of progress achieved in project implementation by the&#13;
Government and the executing agencies, in particular in accordance with their respective&#13;
agreements; and (b) a draft action program, covering the period through project&#13;
completion, which shall include the following: (i) program of works; (ii) detailed&#13;
procurement program; (iii) detailed technical assistance and training; and (iv) detailed&#13;
financing plan, including cost recovery measures and Government in kind counterpart.&#13;
Promptly after completion of the mid-term review, recommendations arising therefrom, as&#13;
agreed by the Government and IDA, shall be carried out. Assurance has been obtained&#13;
from Government at negotiations that this mid-term project implementation review would&#13;
be carried out under the conditions and according to the schedule mentioned above (para&#13;
5.2).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
4.   ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. JUSTIFICATION&#13;
4.1    Background. Inadequate drainage infrastructure imposes a number of costs on&#13;
the city of Bangui and its population. First, 15,000-20,000 houses are subject to 10-20&#13;
days of flooding every year, and incur repair and maintenance expenses estimated&#13;
(conservatively) at US$100 per house. Second, flooding is also the main reason for the&#13;
premature deterioration and poor condition of the urban road network--only 38 percent of&#13;
Bangui's 56 km of paved roads and 16 percent of Bangui's 48 km of unpaved roads are in&#13;
good conditions. Third, flooding renders in-city transportation more costly: during the&#13;
rainy season, secondary roads are often unpassable, and access to under-developed&#13;
residential areas virtually impossible to vehicles. Fourth, standing pools of stagnant water&#13;
resulting from insufficient drainage act as breeding grounds for malarial mosquitoes while&#13;
inadequate access to safe drinking water and appropriate sanitation is the main cause of&#13;
gastrointestinal diseases. Children and adolescents are the main victims of the unhealthy&#13;
environment and inadequate access to safe water. In 1989, the last year for which&#13;
comprehensive data are available, parasitic communicable diseases including malaria,&#13;
along with gastrointestinal illnesses accounted for 49 percent of all diseases reported by&#13;
health centers in Bangui (para. 1.10 to 1.14). Data collected in 1995 suggest that, on&#13;
average, people suffer from two malaria occurrences per year, preventing them from going&#13;
to work during three days each, and one occurrence of diarrhea, inducing one day of&#13;
absenteeism per year. Fever occurrences are also the cause of some absenteeism, but&#13;
there are no reliable data on the number of days of work lost as a result of such&#13;
occurrences. Similarly, children illnesses prevent mothers from going to work, but again&#13;
in this case, no reliable estimates exist of the number of days of work lost as a result.&#13;
4.2   Project Benefits. The project has two main components (para. 2.3). The first&#13;
consists of the rehabilitation of the main drainage system of Bangui, which will create the&#13;
capacity to evacuate storm water and reduce the number of days of flooding in the central&#13;
part of the city from about 20 at present, to zero. The second consists of the upgrading&#13;
of secondary and tertiary drainage and streets networks in two neighborhoods of the city&#13;
where 50,000 (generally low-income) people live. These two neighborhoods have been&#13;
selected within a group of five, with a total population of about 120,000 inhabitants,&#13;
particularly prone to flooding and vulnerable to water-borne diseases and other illnesses&#13;
associated to inadequate access to safe water and inadequate sanitation (FAC is currently&#13;
carrying out development studies on the other three neighborhoods).  Therefore, in&#13;
addition to the improvement of the drainage system in this area, the project also includes,&#13;
inter-alia (para. 2.3 b), a component aimed at improving shallow wells and latrines,&#13;
increasing the provision of safe water (through increasing the number of water kiosks and&#13;
water connections to community buildings), and ensuring the pre-collection of solid&#13;
wastes.&#13;
4.3    The benefits that have been considered in estimating the economic rate of return of&#13;
the project are essentially three: (a) health benefits consisting of reduction in absenteeism&#13;
related to waterborne and insect-borne diseases; (b) reduction in the costs of housing&#13;
25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Central African Republic Urban Environmental Rehabilitation Project&#13;
repair and maintenance now caused by flooding; and (c) time savings stemming from&#13;
the reduction in flooding, and thus in the time required for in-city transportation. The&#13;
valuation of the first and third benefits is critically dependent on the valuation of time, and&#13;
thus on the working population's earnings. Available data indicate a labor force&#13;
participation rate of 49 percent, an average wage rate for unskilled labor of CFAF 360,000&#13;
per year free of taxes, and about 200 days of work per year per worker. Labor markets&#13;
for unskilled labor are unregulated. Market wages should thus approximate the scarcity&#13;
value of labor. However, to be on the conservative side, a conversion factor of 0.69 has&#13;
been applied to unskilled labor costs. A detailed economic analysis of the project is given&#13;
in Annex E, showing an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of 17.0 percent. In addition, the&#13;
sensitivity analysis carried out shows that an overall cost increase of 20 percent would&#13;
yield an ERR of about 15 percent. Similarly, a reduction of the time saving benefits to&#13;
zero or a 50 percent decrease in the health benefits would yield an ERR of about 14 and&#13;
13 percent respectively. A reduction of all benefits of the project of 30 percent would&#13;
yield an ERR of about 13 percent. The table below summarizes the composition of&#13;
benefits in the first twenty-five years of the project, assuming a population growth rate of&#13;
3.0 percent per year. Other benefits such as reduction of maintenance costs of the urban&#13;
road network and limitation of soil erosion and obstruction of drainage canals, have not&#13;
been included in estimating the rate of return.&#13;

4.4   Environmental Aspects. The project environmental assessment category is rated&#13;
B, because it mainly deals with urban infrastructure rehabilitation. Concern for improving&#13;
environmental and sanitary conditions is a major dimension of the project objectives, and&#13;
particularly of works to be financed under the project. The project's environmental&#13;
impact analysis was carried out during post-appraisal, and found out that all proposed&#13;
components would be beneficial to environmental rehabilitation, provided that mitigation&#13;
measures, mainly appropriate drainage design and sound quarry exploitation criteria, are&#13;
applied. These issues will be routinely reviewed by IDA, at the stages of both yearly work&#13;
programs approvals and supervision missions. All resettlement issues would be dealt with&#13;
in the framework of the procedures mutually agreed upon by the Government and IDA&#13;
(para 2.3d). The resettlement procedures agreed upon will ensure that resettled families&#13;
26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
will achieve living standards and income capacity equal or better than before resettlement.&#13;
The project would make a positive overall contribution to CAR's environmental quality,&#13;
and any potentially negative consequences related to involuntary resettlement and quarries&#13;
management would be properly addressed in the project's detailed engineering (Annex L).&#13;
About one third of project-financed civil works would involve rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance of primary drains and sanitary facilities, being not only free of negative&#13;
environmental consequences but also contributing to a substantial improvement in&#13;
environmental urban sanitation. No significant impacts on natural habitats are expected.&#13;
The project is consistent with national and regional land use and environmental planning&#13;
initiatives, conservation strategies and environmental legislation.&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
4.5   This is the first Bank project in CAR dealing with urban issues. While some of the&#13;
institutions involved in the project (such as the RF, para. 1.28) are known to IDA and&#13;
have been tested in other Bank projects, some key institutions are new. In particular,&#13;
ATRACOM has just been created and it has yet to establish a track record. DGHAT and&#13;
the Municipality of Bangui have relatively little experience in urban management and has&#13;
yet to develop the capacity to identify and plan urban investments, and to mobilize the&#13;
finance required for their maintenance. Therefore, the two main risks associated to the&#13;
project are (a) delays in project execution; and (b) shortfalls in the financial resources&#13;
required to maintain the assets created under the project. Both risks would have a&#13;
significantly negative effect on the expected ERR of the project. For example, a three&#13;
year delay in project completion would lower the ERR to 16 percent. A two year&#13;
interruption after two years of project implementation (leading to a two year delay in&#13;
project completion) would lower the ERR to 15 percent. Lack of maintenance of the&#13;
assets created under the project would lower the ERR to 11 percent.&#13;
4.6   Several steps have been taken to reduce the likelihood of these risks materializing.&#13;
First, ATRACOM will be provided under the project with technical assistance, and&#13;
administrative an accounting support. Also, the scope of the project has been kept&#13;
relatively modest in order not to stretch the new agency's implementation capacity.&#13;
Second, in the short term, resources for maintenance will be provided by the FAEU (para.&#13;
1.30). In the long term, the ongoing reforms of municipal finance (para. 1.27), are&#13;
expected to provide a complementary source. of financing. The proposal, acceptable to&#13;
IDA, of a financing and organizational system apt to sustain maintenance of urban&#13;
infrastructure, is a condition of Board Presentation (para. 5.3). Finally, the focus of the&#13;
project on community participation for rehabilitation of the neighborhoods' infrastructure&#13;
will ensure an enhanced maintenance of the facilities.&#13;

ANNEX E. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The purpose of this analysis is to assess the flows of direct and indirect economic&#13;
costs and benefits associated with the two main components of the project, namely the&#13;
rehabilitation of the main drainage system of Bangui and the investments in two targeted&#13;
neighborhoods. The analysis conducted over 25 years has led to an Economic Rate of&#13;
Return (ERR) of 17.0 percent'. However, given the difficulties of quantifying some&#13;
parameters and the risks related to the project implementation and sustainability, a&#13;
sensitivity analysis has been carried out: the most pessimistic assumptions have led to an&#13;
ERR of  1.0 percent.&#13;
2.    The benefits that have been considered in estimating the ERR of the project are&#13;
essentially three: (i) health benefits consisting of reduction in absenteeism related to&#13;
waterborne and insect-borne diseases; (ii) time savings stemming from the reduction in&#13;
flooding and thus in time required for in-city transportation, and (iii) reduction in the costs&#13;
of housing repair and maintenance now caused by flooding. The costs used in the&#13;
calculation are based on the amounts of the investments and other costs related to the&#13;
project, to which the new maintenance costs due to new investments under the two main&#13;
components are added.&#13;
3.    The main assumptions which constitute the basis of the project economic analysis&#13;
are precised hereafter, starting with the factors applied to convert all amounts used to&#13;
world prices. An assessment, first of the benefits, and second of the costs, follows. A&#13;
sensitivity analysis is then described. Finally, the fiscal aspects are briefly presented.&#13;
CONVERSION FACTORS&#13;
4.    The two conversion factors used in this economic analysis are:&#13;
Average conversion factor for non-traded items:   0.947;&#13;
Conversion factor for unskilled labor:        0.69.&#13;
5.    To convert local costs to world prices, the ACF has been applied to the local costs&#13;
included in all the costs taken into account in the calculation, as well as to the local costs&#13;
saved by the reduction of housing repair and maintenance. In principle, there are no trade&#13;
controls in CAR, such as import quotas and licenses. Thus, no additional scarcity margin&#13;
is added to the domestic price of traded items and a factor of one has been applied for&#13;
costs in foreign currency.&#13;
I See Table E. I.&#13;
42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
6.    In CAR, there is no evidence of an excess supply of unskilled labor and the market&#13;
wage is likely to approximate the scarcity value of labor. However, to be on the&#13;
conservative side, it was assumed that the opportunity cost of unskilled labor was the&#13;
average product of labor in the economy (that is GDP divided by the number of people in&#13;
the labor force). This yields a conversion factor (CF) of 0.69 which has been used for&#13;
unskilled labor. This conversion factor is utilized in the evaluation of all the costs and all&#13;
the benefits. No adjustment was done to skilled labor for which the market rate was&#13;
assumed to equal its opportunity cost.&#13;
BENEFITS&#13;
7.    The project has two main components. The first consists of the rehabilitation of&#13;
the main drainage system of Bangui which will create the capacity to evacuate water from&#13;
rains and reduce the number of city-wide days of flooding from about 20 at present, to&#13;
zero at the project completion date in 2001. The second consists of the upgrading of&#13;
secondary and tertiary drainage and streets network in two selected neighborhoods of the&#13;
city where 50,000 people live. This area of Bangui is among the most subjected to&#13;
flooding and its population is vulnerable to illnesses associated to inadequate access to&#13;
safe water and inadequate sanitation. Therefore, in addition to the improvement of the&#13;
drainage system in this area, the project also includes, inter alia, a component aimed at&#13;
improving hygiene through improved shallow wells and latrines and sensitization&#13;
campaigns, increasing the provision of safe water through construction of water kiosks&#13;
and water connections for community building, and ensuring the collection and safe&#13;
disposal of solid wastes.&#13;
8.    The main benefits of these two components are: (i) a reduction in the occurrences&#13;
of water borne and insect-borne diseases translated into better productivity at work&#13;
through lower absenteeism rates; (ii) time savings; and (iii) a reduction in the costs of&#13;
housing repair and maintenance. The valuation of the first two benefits is critically&#13;
dependent on the valuation of time, and thus on the working population's earnings. The&#13;
labor market is not regulated in CAR. Available data, used in the calculation of the first&#13;
two benefits, indicate a population growth of three percent per year2, a labor force&#13;
participation rate of 49 percent3, a percentage of unskilled workers of 90 percent of the&#13;
active population, an average wage rate for unskilled labor of CFAF 360,000 per year free&#13;

of taxes, an average wage rate for skilled workers twice higher, and about 200 days of&#13;
work per year per worker4.&#13;
Health Benerits&#13;
9.     For the purpose of the quantitative evaluation of the health benefits, the impact of&#13;
the decrease in waterborne and insect-borne diseases on the absenteeism rate at&#13;
work, and hence on the productivity of workers, has been used. Therefore, the number of&#13;
days currently lost as a result of these diseases has been assessed, as well as the population&#13;
concerned by the health benefits and the extend of the reduction of absenteeism expected&#13;
from the project.&#13;
10.   As a conservative hypothesis, it is assumed that six days of sick leave per worker&#13;
and per year are due to waterborne and insect borne diseases. In 1989, the last year for&#13;
which comprehensive data are available, parasitic communicable diseases including&#13;
malaria, intestinal worms and other body parasites, along with gastrointestinal illnesses,&#13;
accounted for 49.2 percent of all diseases reported by health centers in Bangui'. Data&#13;
collected in 1995 suggest that, on average, people suffer from two malaria occurrences&#13;
per year, preventing them to go to work during about three days; and one occurrence of&#13;
diarrhea, inducing one day of absenteeism. Fever occurrences must also cause&#13;
absenteeism, but there are no reliable data on the number of days of work lost as a result&#13;
of such occurrences. Similarly, children illnesses prevent mothers from going to work, but&#13;
again in this case, no reliable estimates of the induced absenteeism exist.&#13;
11.   The population served by the main drainage system  outside the two targeted&#13;
neighborhoods, estimated at about 450,000 inhabitants, will be able to reduce by 35&#13;
percent the six days of work now lost due to occurrences of malaria and diarrhea. The&#13;
50,000 inhabitants of the two neighborhoods to be targeted by the project6 will experience&#13;
a decrease of 70 percent of this six days of absenteeism7.&#13;
12.   The health benefits for the society have thus been evaluated as the average wage&#13;
per worker, per day, multiplied by the number of the active population served and by the&#13;
expected decrease in the number of sick days per worker. It has to be stressed that health&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
benefits for the society have here been underestimated, as the absenteeism rate related to&#13;
waterborne disease is likely to be higher than assumed and the average wage may&#13;
undervalue the contribution of the worker to the production. Moreover, actions foreseen&#13;
in the two targeted neighborhoods are expected to develop community awareness and&#13;
education that should enhance and sustain the health benefits. The indirect way used to&#13;
quantify the health component of the project should anyway not mask the essential benefit&#13;
in the quality of life.&#13;
Time Savings&#13;
13.   The protection from flooding that derives from improved drainage system has an&#13;
impact on time savings. To estimate this benefit, the average number of occurrences of&#13;
flooding per year was calculated8, based on the number of days of rain per year. Although&#13;
the surveys indicate a large variation in flooding, for the purposes of this calculation, an&#13;
average of 20 days of flooding per year without the project has been used. With the&#13;
project, this number would be reduced to zero.&#13;
14.   The population subject to flooding represents 75,000 inhabitants9, which are&#13;
supposed to lose 30 percent of their time during Bangui's flooding. Thus, time savings&#13;
have been quantified in monetary terms as the average wage per worker, per day,&#13;
multiplied by the number of the active population concerned and by the expected&#13;
reduction of time wasted during flooding.&#13;
Reduction in Costs of Housing Repair and Maintenance&#13;
15.   In CAR, the absence of land market makes it impossible to study the real impact of&#13;
de-flooding on property values. Although the overall property rental values would be&#13;
higher in de-flooded as against flooded areas, the differential in rental values was not&#13;
quantifiable. Therefore the cost of housing repairs due to flooding has been used as a&#13;
proxy of the benefit on property values. This cost constitutes a major annual expense for&#13;
the household. Improved drainage system is therefore expected to reduce the annual costs&#13;
of repair and maintenance for houses, by suppressing flooding and the induced housing&#13;
repairs.&#13;
16.   The reduction in house maintenance costs is calculated based on the number of&#13;
flooded houses before the project, and the cost of house repair after flooding,&#13;
respectively accounting for 15,000'° and US$100". It is assumed that this cost will not&#13;

change during the project life. It is also assumed that 45 percent of these costs are local, of&#13;
which 70 percent are unskilled labor.&#13;
Other benefits&#13;
17.   The elimination of flooding limits the creation and transportation of sediments and&#13;
solid objects that obstruct the drainage canals. Furthermore, continuous undermining of&#13;
the streets surface and subbase by flooding requires more frequent maintenance and&#13;
reduces the life of the pavement. Improved drainage system is so expected to reduce the&#13;
annual costs of repair and maintenance for streets.&#13;
COSTS&#13;
18.   Costs used in the calculation are based on: (i) the amounts of the investments and&#13;
other costs related to the project; (ii) the additional maintenance costs related to the works&#13;
in the two targeted neighborhoods; and (iii) the additional maintenance costs due to the&#13;
main drainage system rehabilitation and extension.&#13;
19.   The total costs of the project net of taxes and duties (Annex A) have been&#13;
incorporated into the calculation. To apply the average conversion factor described in&#13;
para. 4 to the local costs, the amounts of investments have been divided into foreign and&#13;
local costs according to the ratios established in the project costs estimates (Annex A). In&#13;
the same way, to use the conversion factor for unskilled labor (para. 5), the part of labor&#13;
costs included in the local costs has been obtained from the project costs estimates. The&#13;
composition of the costs under each component of the project is reminded hereafter. The&#13;
amounts of investments related to the main drainage component comprise 49.7 percent of&#13;
local costs, of which 70 percent account for unskilled labor. The integrated neighborhood&#13;
development component costs comprise 42.6 percent of local costs, compounded of 80&#13;
percent of unskilled labor. A conversion factor of one has been applied to the ATRACOM&#13;
fees, the general studies costs and the institutional support costs. The resettlement costs&#13;
comprise 45 percent of local costs, that cover 70 percent of unskilled labor.&#13;
20.   Maintenance costs for new  investments under the drainage and streets&#13;
component in the two targeted neighborhoods are taken into account in the calculation&#13;
of the total project return. These costs are calculated based on one percent of the amount&#13;
of the works related to these new investments, that is compounded of 42.6 percent of&#13;
local costs, of which 80 percent represent unskilled labor.&#13;
21.   The additional maintenance costs of the main drainage canals to be&#13;
rehabilitated or extended are also considered in the cost-benefit analysis. They are&#13;
l five percent of US$2,000, which is the average house price.&#13;
46&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
12&#13;
calculated for eight main sub-components . As in the composition of the investment costs&#13;
under the main drainage component, it is assumed that 49.7 percent of the maintenance&#13;
costs are local, of which 70 percent cover unskilled labor.&#13;
SENSITIVITY AND RISKS ANALYSIS&#13;
22.   Some benefits of the project are difficult to quantify and there is a possibility of&#13;
double counting. Besides, the expected results of the project are jeopardized by two types&#13;
of risks, one related to project implementation weaknesses and the other to the&#13;
sustainability of facilities built or rehabilitated during project implementation. Therefore,&#13;
the sensitivity of the expected ERR to increase in the above presented costs and decrease&#13;
in the estimated benefits has been studied. The influence on the ERR of risks of (i) delays&#13;
in project implementation and (ii) lack of maintenance after project completion has also&#13;
been evaluated. Finally, to determine the impact of the calculation of the conversion factor&#13;
for unskilled labor on the ERR, two extreme values have been attributed to this factor to&#13;
cover a wide range of potentialities. The results are summarized below:&#13;
(i)    Whole project as presented in para. 6 through 22     17.0%&#13;
(ii)   20% cost increase                                    14.6%&#13;
(iii)   Time savings benefits reduced to zero               14.1%&#13;
(iv)   50 % decrease in health benefits                     13.3%&#13;
(v)   30% reduction in all benefits                         12.5%&#13;
(vi)   Three year extension of project completion           15.7%&#13;
(vii)  Two year interruption after two years of project     15.3%&#13;
implementation, and two year extension of project completion&#13;
(viii)  No maintenance: Exponentially decreasing factors    11.0%&#13;
applied to the expected benefits&#13;
(ix)   Conversion factor for unskilled labor set at 113     18.5%&#13;
(x)   Conversion factor for unskilled labor set at 0.5 14   15.1%&#13;
Costs Increase&#13;
23.   The amounts of the investments are well known. However, the overall costs&#13;
related to the project may vary due to physical as well as price contingencies. That's why a&#13;
20 percent cost increase has been simulated. It shows an economic rate of return of 14.6&#13;
percent'5.&#13;

Central African Republic Urban Environmental Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Benefits Decrease&#13;
24.   The time savings benefits depend on many parameters which are difficult to assess&#13;
and which are subject to variations. What's more, in case of a year without any flood, the&#13;
project would not change absenteeism, late arrivals at work or time spent in&#13;
transportation. So the economic rate of return of the project without taking into account&#13;
the time savings benefits has been calculated: 14.1 percent16.&#13;
25.   The health benefits are the main rationale for the drainage and sanitation&#13;
components of the project. However, they are hard to evaluate due to the obvious&#13;
difficulty of quantifying the value of human well-being. To see how much this evaluation&#13;
of health benefits conditions the economic rate of return of the project, the health benefits&#13;
17&#13;
have been reduced by 50 percent. The ERR accounts then for 13.3 percent&#13;
26.   Possible variations in the value of the three main benefit sources have been taken&#13;
into account individually. However, one could imagine that if there were no flood during&#13;
some years all benefits would be reduced. That's why a 30 percent reduction in all benefits&#13;
has been simulated, corresponding to the worst possible situation. It gives an economic&#13;
rate of return of 12.5 percent'.&#13;
Risks Analysis&#13;
27.   Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis has to reflect the possible consequences of the&#13;
main risks associated with project implementation or sustainability. The difricult&#13;
economic situation in CAR could divert the Government's focus from the project and&#13;
entail delays in project implementation (long bidding processes, delays in works&#13;
execution...), thus leading to delayed attainment of the project's objectives. Another&#13;
implementation risk related to the ability of ATRACOM to carry out its tasks would&#13;
have the same effects on project progress, slowing down the implementation of all&#13;
components handled by ATRACOM as executing agency. To take into account these&#13;
implementation risks, two delay scenarii have been simulated, the first one with a three&#13;
year extension of project completion and the second one with a two year interruption after&#13;
two years of project implementation, leading to a two year extension of project&#13;
completion. These scenarii give respectively an ERR of 15.7'9 and 15.3 percent20.&#13;
16 See Table E.3.&#13;
17 See Table EA4.&#13;
18 See Table E.5.&#13;
19 See Table E .6.&#13;
20 See Table E. 7.&#13;
48&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
28.   Finally, the risk related to the sustainability of the facilities and infrastructure&#13;
built or rehabilitated during project implementation has been taken into account as&#13;
follows: assuming a lack of maintenance of the infrastructure, the additional maintenance&#13;
costs induced by the project being covered neither by the Government through the RF and&#13;
the FAEU, nor by the direct beneficiaries in the targeted neighborhoods, the expected&#13;
benefits would fall drastically. It is estimated that following an accelerated decrease, they&#13;
would be reduced to zero 10 years after the project completion date. This decrease has&#13;
been simulated by applying exponentially decreasing factors to the expected benefits. The&#13;
ERR accounts then for 11.0 percent2'.&#13;
FISCAL ASPECTS&#13;
29.   As an immediate measure, maintenance costs of new investments carried out in the&#13;
project are expected to be offset by the portion of RUR which will be allocated to the&#13;
FAEU (para. 1.28 through 1.30). Moreover, the issue of the sustainability of the&#13;
infrastructure investments in the long term are being dealt with. Along with the French&#13;
Cooperation program that fosters the municipal finance and organizational streamlining,&#13;
the proposed project aims at creating the conditions necessary for reforms required for&#13;
urban development. First, the project provides support to several institutions, namely&#13;
DGHAT, MPS, DDC and the Municipality of Bangui, mainly through training, short-term&#13;
assistance, equipment and vehicle; hence, it insists on capacity building for municipal&#13;
administration and management. Secondly, the creation of ATRACOM should allow the&#13;
municipality to gradually resume more of a management role while leaving day-to-day&#13;
execution and supervision to ATRACOM, thus reducing the degree of involvement of the&#13;
municipal technical services staff. The project therefore aims at laying the grounds for a&#13;
better municipal financial management. It helps organize a municipal reform that should&#13;
lead to increased fiscal revenues at a local level in the long term.&#13;

Annex J&#13;
FaisabiIite technique, economique et sociale&#13;
Les zones d'intervention retenues devront faire l'objet d'une etude de faisabilite&#13;
technique, economique et sociale permettant d'evaluer pour chaque zone consideree:&#13;
&#149;  le programme et le montant des travaux a executer,&#13;
&#149;  les contraintes geotechniques pouvant entrainer des depenses imprevues,&#13;
les difficultes en matiere de decasement/recasement des populations situees sur le trace&#13;
des equipements a realiser;&#13;
les programmes de sensibilisation, d'animation sociale et d'education sanitaire a mener;&#13;
les possibilites et modalites de recuperation partielle des cofuts d'amenagement aupres&#13;
des beneficiaires.&#13;
Cette etude de faisabilite necessitera tres vraisemblablement l'tablissement d'un&#13;
etat des lieux prealable comportant entre autres:&#13;
*  un etat des infrastructures de la zone consideree, en particulier des passages sous voies&#13;
et des collecteurs existants;&#13;
*  un releve topographique des voies permettant d'evaluer les solutions techniques&#13;
appropriees en matiere d'assainissement;&#13;
*  une analyse fonciere sommaire permettant notamment, sur la base des plans cadastraux&#13;
disponibles et d'enquetes complementaires ad hoc n'entrainant pas de leves&#13;
topographiques mais un simple reperage: (i) de faire le point sur les situations&#13;
fonci6res actuelles (domaine public, domaine prive de l'Etat, permis d'habiter/d'occuper&#13;
ou titres fonciers definitifs, autres situations des particuliers), (ii) d'estimer le volume et&#13;
le prix couramment pratique de cessions des parcelles dans la zone, (iii) d'evaluer&#13;
l'importance et la nature des litiges eventuels sur le fonds ou sur les limites de&#13;
parcelles; (iv) de reperer les opportunites foncieres qui pourraient se degager pour&#13;
recaser dans la zone consideree les populations situees sur le trace des ouvrages a&#13;
realiser; (v) d'estimer les montants necessaires a la "purge" des droits sur les&#13;
opportunites foncieres eventuellement reperees;&#13;
.  une enquete legere (qualitative) permettant une evaluation par les populations&#13;
concernees du programme d'amenagement propose et une evaluation de leur volonte a&#13;
participer aux travaux d'amenagement de leur quartier sous la forme la plus appropri6e&#13;
(contribution en nature sous forme de travail, regularisation fonciere entrainant une&#13;
contribution forfaitaire, contribution de riverainete sur une base volontaire ou&#13;
obligatoire etc.);&#13;
Enquetes, topographie, etudes techniques detaill&amp;es, processus de concertation&#13;
Sur la zone/quartier jugee prioritaire, a partir des propositions d'amenagement qui&#13;
ont ete jugees faisables au plan technique et socio-economique et definies en concertation&#13;
avec les populations beneficiaires a l'issue de l'etude de faisabilite, le consultant devra&#13;

ANNEX L. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
Le Projet de Rehabilitation de 1'Environnement Urbain (PREU) est classe&#13;
"Cat6gorie B". Une analyse environnementale du Programme de Developpement&#13;
Municipal, ainsi que des deux principales composantes du projet, a ete finalisee en juillet&#13;
1995 par un consultant recrute a cet effet par le Govemement. Le rapport detail1l de&#13;
l'etude est disponible dans les archives du projet. Un resume des impacts&#13;
environnementaux et des mesures preconisees pour les maitriser est presente pour les&#13;
composantes drainage et developpement integre des quartiers, dans les tableaux L. 1 et L.2&#13;
joints a cette annexe.&#13;
II en ressort que les impacts positifs principaux sont ceux auxquels est attribue un&#13;
degre de priorite eleve en fonction de leur durabilite (effet a long terme). C'est le cas&#13;
notamment pour les aspects lies a la securit6, a l'accessibilite et la salubrite du milieu, a la&#13;
diminution des risques d'inondations et a l'amelioration en matiere de gestion des dechets.&#13;
Notons que pour ce dernier domaine, l'impact positif a l'interieur des quartiers est&#13;
conditionne par la mise en place prealable d'infrastructures de collecte principale et de&#13;
d6p8t final selon les regles de l'art (decharges contr6lees).&#13;
Les impacts negatifs essentiels sont les impacts sociaux lies aux decasements&#13;
n6cessaires sur les emprises des collecteurs a rehabiliter ou a construire. Un autre impact&#13;
n6gatif a maitriser est lie au choix des materiaux de construction pour la realisation des&#13;
ouvrages. Ces materiaux devront etre selectionnes en s'assurant qu'ils ont et produits&#13;
avec ies precautions minimales requises en matiere d'environnement.&#13;
En reponse a ces impacts negatifs, des mesures ont et proposees par le consultant&#13;
et incorporees dans la d6finition du PREU, notamment dans la composante etudes&#13;
generales. Tout d'abord, les mesures d'accompagnement et d'encadrement&#13;
communautaire en matiere d'environnement, et d'accompagnement des procedures de&#13;
decasement-recasement, interviennent essentiellement sous la rubrique animation des&#13;
etudes generales. Ensuite, un volet environnemental est prevu dans l'etude generale de&#13;
drainage de la zone ouest marecageuse. Enfin, un plan directeur succinct de gestion des&#13;
dechets, la recherche de sites et l'amenagernent d'au moins deux decharges contr6l6es&#13;
pour la ville de Bangui sont pris en compte dans la sous-composante gestion des dechets&#13;
solides et avant-projets sommaires des decharges contr6l6es. Par ailleurs, des mesures&#13;
d'amelioration de la qualite de l'air et d'utilisation rationnelle de l'energie, par la&#13;
realisation d'une dizaine de foyers ameliores par exemple, sont conseillees; elles pourraient&#13;
&amp;re realisees dans la composante amelioration du quartier de N'Gouciment.&#13;

            Environmental Rehabilitation Project

        <abstracts>
            The immediate objectives of the Urban
            Environmental Rehabilitation Project are to: 1) finance
            priority investments in Bangui which will contribute to
            alleviate chronic flooding in the city - to which the poor
            are particularly vulnerable - and improve the living
            conditions of the lower income neighborhoods; and 2) promote
            the development of the private sector, especially small and
            medium enterprises, in the construction industry by
            executing most of the works through an efficient executing
            agency. This agency will be able to process payments
            rapidly, and create employment for unskilled workers, thus
            generating income for the disadvantaged residents by using
            labor-intensive construction techniques. The long term
            objective of the project is to promote an integrated and
            participatory development of Bangui - replicable in other
            cities - by developing appropriate mechanisms of dialogue
            and participation between the population and the government
            at its different levels. The project has the following
            components: 1) rehabilitation and extension of the main
            drainage system of the city of Bangui; 2) integrated and
            participatory neighborhood development; 3) resettlement of
            an estimated 150 households; 4) studies, including the
            update of the urban development plan of the western
            extension area of the city; and 5) institutional support.
