&amp;#12;                     POVERTY STATUS UPDATE â&#128;&#147; OVERVIEW&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
AFGHANISTANâ&#128;&#153;S POVERTY CHALLENGE: STRONG&#13;
GROWTH; PERSISTENT POVERTY&#13;
STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH IN AFGHANISTAN DURING THE PRE-TRANSITION&#13;
PERIOD (2007-08 TO 2011-12) HAS NOT REDUCED POVERTY. Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s per&#13;
capita GDP grew at an average annual rate of 6.9 percent during that period. In&#13;
contrast, in 2007-08, 36 percent of Afghans were poor, and four years later, still, more&#13;
than one in three Afghans did not have the buying power to satisfy their basic food and&#13;
non-food needs.&#13;
&#13;
Economic growth in Afghanistan, therefore, is not in and of itself enough to reduce&#13;
poverty. To achieve poverty reduction, economic growth needs to be far more&#13;
inclusive for everyone, regardless of their circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
PATTERNS OF GROWTH CONTRIBUTED TO WIDENING INEQUALITY. Average&#13;
per capita consumption grew at an annual rate of 1.2 percent between 2007-08 and&#13;
2011-12, but this did not benefit everyone equally, and inequality increased. While&#13;
the poorest 20 percent of the population saw a 2 percent decline in real per capita&#13;
expenditure, the richest 20 percent experienced a nine percent increase. Widening&#13;
inequalities are reflected in an increase of the Gini index, which moved from 29.7 in&#13;
2007-08 to 31.6 percent in 2011-12.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PROFILE OF AFGHANISTANâ&#128;&#153;S POOR: RURAL,&#13;
AGRICULTURAL, UNDEREMPLOYED, AND HIGHLY&#13;
VULNERABLE&#13;
Although it is not possible to determine if the same individuals who were poor in&#13;
2007-08 were still poor in 2011-12, the data shows that the characteristics of the&#13;
poor did not change.&#13;
&#13;
POVERTY IN AFGHANISTAN STRONGLY CORRELATES TO WHERE PEOPLE&#13;
LIVE. Four out of every five poor people live in rural areas. The mountainous&#13;
East, Northeast, and West-Central regionsâ&#128;&#148;where almost half of the inhabitants&#13;
are poorâ&#128;&#148;have the lowest per capita consumption and highest likelihood&#13;
of poverty.&#13;

LACK OF EDUCATION, LIVELIHOOD, AND LACK OF ACCESS TO BASIC SERVICES&#13;
CLEARLY CONTRIBUTE TO AFGHAN POVERTY. Poor people tend to be illiterate&#13;
(75.6 percent), and often lack opportunities to educate their children. Poor people&#13;
face higher unemployment1 (8 percent) or are underemployed (41 percent), and&#13;
when they are employed, they are more likely to have a vulnerable and informal&#13;
job (84.3 percent), most likely in agriculture (43.6 percent). Poor people are much&#13;
less likely to have access to basic services such as electricity (63.8 percent), safe&#13;
drinking water (40.3 percent), and sanitation (2.8 percent).&#13;

&#13;
	In Afghanistan, as in most developing countries, labor is the most critical asset for poor households. For individuals living in&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
 poorer households, being engaged in some sort of income generating activity is a necessity to make ends meet. Poverty,&#13;
 together with the widespread availability of poor quality jobs in the informal sector make open unemployment a typically&#13;
 rare phenomenon. The relatively low level of open unemployment is counterbalanced by the severity of underemployment.&#13;
&#13;

                                                                      â&#128;&#148;3â&#128;&#148;&#13;
&amp;#12;                             POVERTY STATUS UPDATE â&#128;&#147; OVERVIEW&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
POVERTY IN AFGHANISTAN IS CLOSELY INTERTWINED WITH NATURAL AND&#13;
MANMADE RISKS. The poor in Afghanistan are not only more likely to suffer from&#13;
shocks, but also less equipped to deal with their consequences. Approximately&#13;
84 percent of Afghan households experienced at least one economic shock in&#13;
2011-12, and 53 percent suffered from three or more. Due to mountainous terrain,&#13;
poor connectivity and greater reliance on subsistence and rain-fed agriculture, the&#13;
poorest regions in the East, Northeast and West-Central are particularly exposed&#13;
and vulnerable to shocks, especially natural hazards. Poor households are more&#13;
likely to deal with risks using harmful coping mechanisms that may be necessary in&#13;
the short term, but that can have greater long-term negative impacts, reducing the&#13;
likelihood of escaping from poverty2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
INTERNATIONAL SPENDING: AN EFFECTIVE&#13;
DRIVER OF GROWTH, BUT GAINS NOT&#13;
DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY&#13;
Although International spending on military and civilian assistance has contributed&#13;
to economic growth, the gains have not benefitted Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s employment&#13;
sectors and regions equally, nor have they reached the poorest.&#13;
&#13;
INTERNATIONAL SPENDING CONTRIBUTED TO GROWTH AND JOB CREATION&#13;
IN THE SERVICE SECTOR. However, while service sector growth contributed&#13;
to creating good quality jobs, especially in government, health, and education&#13;
services, 80 percent of new jobs were in informal day labor arrangements. Due&#13;
to a lack of education, the poor could not compete for these jobs, and moved&#13;
from vulnerable employment in agriculture to vulnerable employment in the&#13;
service sector.&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, AID DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO RAISING PR ODUCTI VIT Y&#13;
O F T HE AGRICULTURE SECTOR, where most of the poor find employment.&#13;
While losing its GDP primacy, the continued importance of agriculture in&#13;
the Afghan economy contributed to economic growth volatility due to the&#13;
sectorâ&#128;&#153;s high reliance on rain-fed production and vulnerability to weather-&#13;
related shocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
	Lacking proper means to cope with risk, poor households face extremely unfavorable trade-offs when hit by a shock and&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
 may resort to â&#128;&#156;harmfulâ&#128;&#157; coping mechanisms, which includes things like selling livestock or assets that may affect future&#13;
 productivity and livelihood, or increasing use of child labor leading to intergenerational poverty, or reducing consumption&#13;
 and going hungry affecting health, human capital accumulation and future labor productivity.&#13;

INTERNATIONAL SPENDING BENEFITED HIGH-CONFLICT AREAS THE&#13;
MOST, leaving behind the poorest West-Central, Northeast and East regions3. In the&#13;
rest of the country, a thriving service sector created new and less vulnerable jobs,&#13;
but â&#128;&#156;laggingâ&#128;&#157; regions remained reliant on vulnerable employment in agriculture.&#13;
Greater incidence of, and vulnerability to, natural hazards contributed to widening&#13;
inequality between the poorest regions and the rest of the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BEYOND CONSUMPTION: PROGRESS BELIES A&#13;
WIDENING GAP IN ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND&#13;
BASIC SERVICES&#13;
While consumption-based poverty in Afghanistan stagnated, overall country HUMAN&#13;
DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES IMPROVED. Enabled by international aid-supported&#13;
public investment, from 2007-08 to 2011-12, literacy rates for the population aged&#13;
15 and above grew by five percent, youth literacy by 8 percent, and primary school&#13;
enrollment by 6 percent annually. Access to electricity, safe drinking water, and&#13;
improved sanitation all improved, growing annually by approximately 14 percent&#13;
each. While these achievements have been significant, it is important to note that&#13;
- at its pre-transition pace of progress - it will take the country from 20 to 25 years&#13;
to achieve the same level of adult literacy of other low-income or conflict-affected&#13;
countries. Further, it would take Afghanistan from 11 to 15 years to achieve the same&#13;
level of youth literacy, and from 12 to 23 years to achieve the same level of primary-&#13;
school enrollment as countries with a similar profile.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
	Aid increased in non-lagging regions by 79 percent over the period compared to only 31 percent in lagging regions.&#13;

&#13;
AFGHANISTAN IS STILL A LONG WAY FROM CLOSING THE WIDENING GAP&#13;
BETWEEN POOR AND BETTER OFF AFGHANS. Between 2007-08 and 2011-12, the&#13;
gap in education between poor and non-poor Afghans widened. Children in poor&#13;
households have significantly lower school enrollment rates than their counterparts&#13;
in non-poor households. While urban areas and non-lagging regions saw significant&#13;
improvement in school enrollment, education outcomes stagnated in rural areas&#13;
and in lagging regions, mostly due to negative impact of shocks and conflict on&#13;
girlsâ&#128;&#153; enrollment.&#13;

The gap in access to basic services between the poor and non-poor also widened,&#13;
except in the case of access to electricity, mostly due to the expansion in the use&#13;
of solar and battery sources. Expanded service delivery to rural areas reduced&#13;
the urban-rural services access gap, but differences between the poorest East,&#13;
Northeast and West-Central regions and the rest of the country widened, possibly&#13;
reflecting differences in international aid allocation.&#13;

While economic growth is necessary to reduce poverty, the poor must actually benefit from&#13;
that growth. Poverty reduction hinges on the ability of the poorest to earn a good living;&#13;
accumulate, control, and protect assets; and access quality services and opportunities. For&#13;
Afghanistan, this means:&#13;
&#13;
 1)	 STRENGTHENING AGRICULTURE to sustain growth as aid dwindles, and for&#13;
     accelerating poverty reduction. As 75.6 percent of poor aged 15 and above are illiterate,&#13;
     they cannot take advantage of better employment opportunities requiring high skills,&#13;
     so poverty reduction should benefit the most from growth in sectors like agriculture&#13;
     where the poor concentrate.&#13;
&#13;
 2)	INVESTING IN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT to support economic growth, improve&#13;
    welfare, reduce poverty, and bridge gaps in these areas between Afghanistan and&#13;
    other countries in the region. While continuing to expand supply of education, health&#13;
    and basic services, the country should devote greater attention to improving access&#13;
    and quality in underserved areas and among traditionally under-served groups such&#13;
    as girls and the poor.&#13;
&#13;
 3)	MANAGING AND MITIGATING RISK. Geography (exposure to natural hazards),&#13;
    economic structure, and high incidence of poverty (householdsâ&#128;&#153; limited ability to&#13;
    cope with shocks) require coordinated assistance to prevent and mitigate risks, and to&#13;
    help people cope with the impact of shocks. In particular, greater attention should be&#13;
    devoted to the development of an efficient system of safety nets to promote poverty&#13;
    reduction, and to complement and improve the effectiveness of investments in human&#13;
    development and agriculture.&#13;

            Afghanistan - Poverty status update
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Afghanistan’s per capita Gross Domestic
            Product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 6.9 percent
            during that period. In contrast, in 2007-08, 36 percent of
            Afghans were poor, and four years later, still, more than
            one in three Afghans did not have the buying power to
            satisfy their basic food and non-food needs. Economic growth
            in Afghanistan, therefore, is not in and of itself enough to
            reduce poverty. To achieve poverty reduction, economic
            growth needs to be far more inclusive for everyone,
            regardless of their circumstances. While economic growth is
            necessary to reduce poverty, the poor must actually benefit
            from that growth. Poverty reduction hinges on the ability of
            the poorest to earn a good living; accumulate, control, and
            protect assets; and access quality services and
            opportunities. For Afghanistan, this means: strengthening
            agriculture, investing in human development, managing and
            mitigating risk.
