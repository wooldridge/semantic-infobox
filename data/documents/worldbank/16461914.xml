&amp;#12;&amp;#12;About the Series&#13;
Building strong education systems that promote learning is fundamental to&#13;
development and economic growth. Over the past few years, as developing&#13;
countries have succeeded in building more classrooms, and getting millions&#13;
more children into school, the education community has begun to actively&#13;
embrace the vision of measurable learning for all children in school. However,&#13;
learning depends not only on resources invested in the school system, but also&#13;
on the quality of the policies and institutions that enable their use and on how&#13;
well the policies are implemented.&#13;
     In 2011, the World Bank Group launched Education Sector Strategy 2020:&#13;
Learning for All, which outlines an agenda for achieving â&#128;&#156;Learning for Allâ&#128;? in&#13;
the developing world over the next decade. To support implementation of the&#13;
strategy, the World Bank commenced a multi year program to support countries&#13;
in systematically examining and strengthening the performance of their&#13;
education systems. This evidence based initiative, called SABER (Systems&#13;
Approach for Better Education Results), is building a toolkit of diagnostics for&#13;
examining education systems and their component policy domains against&#13;
global standards, best practices, and in comparison with the policies and&#13;
practices of countries around the world. By leveraging this global knowledge,&#13;
SABER fills a gap in the availability of data and evidence on what matters most&#13;
to improve the quality of education and achievement of better results.&#13;
     SABER Student Assessment, one of the systems examined within the SABER&#13;
program, has developed tools to analyze and benchmark student assessment&#13;
policies and systems around the world, with the goal of promoting stronger&#13;
assessment systems that contribute to improved education quality and learning&#13;
for all. To help explore the state of knowledge in the area, the SABER Student&#13;
Assessment team invited leading academics, assessment experts, and&#13;
practitioners from developing and industrialized countries to come together to&#13;
discuss assessment issues relevant for improving education quality and learning&#13;
outcomes. The papers and case studies on student assessment in this series are&#13;
the result of those conversations and the underlying research. Prior to&#13;
publication, all of the papers benefited from a rigorous review process, which&#13;
included comments from World Bank staff, academics, development&#13;
practitioners, and country assessment experts.&#13;
     All SABER Student Assessment papers in this series were made possible by&#13;
support from the Russia Education Aid for Development Trust Fund (READ TF).&#13;
READ TF is a collaboration between the Russian Federation and the World Bank&#13;
that supports the improvement of student learning outcomes in low income&#13;
countries through the development of robust student assessment systems.&#13;
     The SABER working paper series was produced under the general guidance&#13;
of Elizabeth King, Education Director, and Robin Horn, Education Manager in&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Abstract&#13;
As more and more countriesâ&#128;&#148;both developed and developingâ&#128;&#148;have become&#13;
interested in collecting information on student learning, there has been a&#13;
concomitant growth in the demand for strong student assessment systems. The&#13;
World Bank is at the forefront of efforts to support developing countries in the&#13;
strengthening of their student assessment systems. This paper provides an&#13;
overview of the World Bank s support for assessment activities in its client&#13;
countries between 1998 and 2009. The paper highlights key lessons learned from&#13;
this experience and offers guidance to development staff and country teams for&#13;
the more effective design and implementation of assessment activities in&#13;
education projects.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
Around the world, country governments, international organizations, and other&#13;
stakeholders are working together to achieve the Millennium Development Goal&#13;
of universal primary education by 2015. While attainment of this goal is&#13;
extremely important, it is not enough. Children not only must have access to an&#13;
education, but they also must have access to a quality education that results in&#13;
learning. Such learning should include knowledge, skills, and abilities that enable&#13;
children to become active and productive participants in society. With the global&#13;
shift to this dual focus on access and learning, it has become more important&#13;
than ever that countries put in place mechanisms to determine whether and to&#13;
what extent children enrolled in school are learning. Such mechanisms include&#13;
various forms of student assessment that allow for the collection, analysis, and&#13;
use of data on student learning and achievement at the classroom, subnational,&#13;
national, and even international levels.&#13;
     The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s development strategy for the education sector has&#13;
continually emphasized the need for measurement of student learning and&#13;
achievement as a key input to helping client countries achieve desired&#13;
educational, economic, and social outcomes (World Bank 1995). For example, the&#13;
World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s 1999 Education Sector Strategy noted the importance of encouraging&#13;
countries to â&#128;&#156;develop good national assessment systemsâ&#128;? (World Bank 1999),&#13;
and its 2005 Education Sector Strategy Update reiterated the need â&#128;&#156;to systematize&#13;
capacity building for learning assessments and to help countries develop reliable,&#13;
timely statistics about student learningâ&#128;? (World Bank 2005). The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
most recent education sector strategy continues this emphasis on efforts to&#13;
support developing countries in building stronger and more effective student&#13;
assessment systems as a key part of the development of their overall education&#13;
systems (World Bank 2011).&#13;
     This paper provides an overview of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s support for student&#13;
assessment activities in client countries between 1998 and 2009.1 The paper aims&#13;

Review of World Bank Support for Student Assessment Activities in Client Countries, 1998â&#128;&#147;2009                  1&#13;
&amp;#12;    to inform Bank staff, client country governments, and other development&#13;
    partners about key trends in this support based on an analysis of World Bankâ&#128;&#147;&#13;
    supported education projects conducted over the 12 year period. The paper&#13;
    identifies lessons learned from these projects and offers guidance on more&#13;
    effective design and implementation of assessment activities in education&#13;
    projects. An earlier World Bank study by Linda Larach and Marlaine Lockheed&#13;
    conducted a similar review of Bank support for student assessment activities in&#13;
    client countries between 1963 and 1993.2 This current paper references, and&#13;
    makes comparisons to, findings from that earlier report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Summary of Findings&#13;
    Between 1998 and 2009, the World Bank provided support for 355 education&#13;
    projects in its client countries, 306 of which were under the International Bank for&#13;
    Reconstruction and Development/International Development Association&#13;
    (IBRD/IDA) and Special Financing product lines. Of those 306 projects, 166&#13;
    included support for student assessment activities. As shown in Table 1, these&#13;
    assessment related projects were spread across the six geographic regions&#13;
    covered by the Bank3 and included both low income countries (LICs) and&#13;
    middle income countries (MICs).4 Among the six regions, ECA countries were&#13;
    the most likely to receive support for student assessment activities, with 81&#13;
    percent of education projects in the region including support for assessment. This&#13;
    represents a shift from the time of the Larach and Lockheed review, when the&#13;
    greatest proportion of assessment related projects could be found in the LAC&#13;
    region.&#13;
         Based on the limited available data, financial commitments for assessment&#13;
    activities on the part of donors and country governments were quite substantial&#13;
    during this time period, with 37 percent of the total project amount typically&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    2&#13;
      The Larach and Lockheed (1993) report examined 445 education projects as well as five noneducation&#13;
    projects with education components (specifically, social sector development projects), and collectively&#13;
    referred to these projects as education projects. Our review looks only at education projects managed by&#13;
    the Education Sector Board at the World Bank. The decision to review only Education Sector Boardâ&#128;&#147;&#13;
    managed education projects for this report was based, in part, on the need for a consistent point of&#13;
    comparison, particularly in light of changes in sector codes over time. At the same time, it is still possible&#13;
    to compare the trends identified in the current review with those identified by the Larach and Lockheed&#13;
    report, given that 99 percent of the projects reviewed by Larach and Lockheed were purely education&#13;
    projects.&#13;
    3&#13;
      The World Bank uses the following regional categorizations: Africa (AFR), East Asia and Pacific (EAP),&#13;
    Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), South Asia (SAR), Middle East and North Africa (MNA), and&#13;
    Europe and Central Asia (ECA).&#13;
    4&#13;
      The analysis by income classification looked at LICs, MICs, and high income countries (HICs). To be&#13;
    classified as a LIC, MIC, or HIC, a country needs to meet a certain gross national income (GNI) threshold.&#13;
    The income classification categories are determined by the World Bank. Additional information can be&#13;
    found at http://data.worldbank.org/about/country classifications.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2                                                                      Julia Liberman and Marguerite Clarke&#13;
&amp;#12;allocated for support of assessment activities.5 This is a significant increase from&#13;
the time period reviewed by Larach and Lockheed when, on average, less than 2&#13;
percent of overall project commitments was for assessment activities. Based&#13;
again on the limited available data, actual disbursements, both for projects&#13;
supporting assessment activities and for the assessment activities themselves,&#13;
closely followed the upfront financial commitments.&#13;
     Projects that supported student assessment activities were almost evenly&#13;
split between LICs (90 projects) and MICs (76 projects). Projects in both LICs and&#13;
MICs primarily focused on supporting countriesâ&#128;&#153; efforts to put in place better&#13;
â&#128;&#156;enabling contextsâ&#128;? for carrying out assessment activities in the form of&#13;
appropriate policies, institutional arrangements, and trained staff. MICs tended&#13;
to focus equally on assessment activities at the primary and secondary levels&#13;
whereas LICs were more likely to focus on assessment activities at the primary&#13;
level. Large scale assessments of national achievement levels were by far the&#13;
most common type of assessment to be supported. This is a shift from the time&#13;
period examined by Larach and Lockheed when World Bank education projects&#13;
typically supported activities related to high stakes public or external&#13;
examinations.&#13;
     Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) and Implementation Completion&#13;
Report (ICR) evaluations of assessment activities under closed projects allow us&#13;
to derive some useful lessons that can be applied to future projects. These&#13;
include the importance of establishing stakeholder buy in and roles and&#13;
responsibilities upfront; the need for explicit, transparent, and consistent&#13;
engagement of key stakeholders throughout the project cycle; and the&#13;
importance of planning for continuity and sustainability of the assessment&#13;
related activities and reforms after project closing.&#13;
     The rest of this paper addresses these findings in detail.&#13;

Methodology&#13;
Three sources were used to identify all World Bank education projects approved&#13;
between 1998 and 2009: the World Bank EdStats tool, the official list of education&#13;
projects approved between fiscal 1963 and fiscal 2010 and managed by the&#13;
Education Sector Board, and the World Bank Operations Portal.6 From this&#13;
overall set of projects, those that provided support for activities aimed at&#13;
developing student assessment systems were identified and extracted for further&#13;
analysis. Detailed information about these projects was entered into an Excel&#13;
database.7 Types of information recorded include the following:&#13;
       x general information, such as the project name, year of approval, and&#13;
         project ID&#13;
       x details on support, if any, for participation in international assessmentsâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
         specifically, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study&#13;
         (TIMSS), Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), and&#13;
         Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS)&#13;
       x type of assessment activity supported by the project (for example,&#13;
         classroom assessments for providing real time information to support&#13;

Review of World Bank Support for Student Assessment Activities in Client Countries, 1998â&#128;&#147;2009                        5&#13;
&amp;#12;          teaching and learning in individual classrooms; examinations for student&#13;
          certification and selection decisions; or large scale assessments for&#13;
          monitoring overall system performance and accountability) as well as the&#13;
          level of the education system involved (primary, secondary, tertiary)&#13;
        x aspect of assessment system strengthening targeted by the project (for&#13;
          example, the enabling contextâ&#128;&#148;the broader context in which the&#13;
          assessment activity takes place and the extent to which that context is&#13;
          conducive to, or supportive of, the assessment; system alignmentâ&#128;&#148;the&#13;
          extent to which the assessment activity is aligned with the rest of the&#13;
          education system; or assessment qualityâ&#128;&#148;the psychometric quality of the&#13;
          instruments, processes, and procedures used for the assessment activity)&#13;
         Projects with components or subcomponents that supported student&#13;
    assessment activities were the primary focus of the review. ICRs for closed&#13;
    projects were reviewed to determine whether the planned assessment activities&#13;
    were actually completed. This information was entered into the database. In&#13;
    reviewing the ICR evaluations, key recurring lessons were identified. These&#13;
    lessons are synthesized later on in this paper.&#13;
         The information in the database was analyzed by region as well as by&#13;
    country income classification. For the analyses described in this paper, income&#13;
    classification for the year of project approval by the World Bank s Board of&#13;
    Executive Directors was used.&#13;
         It is important to point out that the goal of this paper is to provide an&#13;
    overview of World Bank support for student assessment activities in individual&#13;
    client countries between 1998 and 2009 and to highlight general trends in that&#13;
    support. In so doing, the paper pulls together a large amount of data and&#13;
    presents it in a summarized and easy to digest form. The paper does not offer an&#13;
    in depth analysis of the factors behind these trends. Such an analysis would&#13;
    require a level of generalization and conjecture that extends beyond the&#13;
    limitations of the available data. The last section of this paper identifies&#13;
    additional areas for possible future study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Detailed Findings&#13;
    The proportion of World Bank education projects that include support for&#13;
    student assessment activities has remained constant over time, suggesting an&#13;
    ongoing focus among client countries in further developing their student&#13;
    assessment systems.&#13;
&#13;
    Regions&#13;
    Between 1975 (the first year in which a subcomponent to support student&#13;
    assessment was incorporated into a World Bank project) and 1993, the World&#13;
    Bank provided support for student assessment activities in 90 projects across 55&#13;

&amp;#12;countries. The greatest number of these projects was in the AFR (30 projects) and&#13;
Asia (25 projects) regions, although LAC had the highest proportion (33 percent,&#13;
or 19 out of 58) of education projects that provided support for assessment&#13;
activities.8&#13;
     From 1998 to 2009, the Board of the World Bank approved funding for 355&#13;
education projects to be implemented in 109 Bank client countries. These projects&#13;
fell under one of four product lines: IBRD/IDA (300 projects), Special Financing&#13;
(6 projects), Recipient Executed (27 projects), and Institutional Development&#13;
Funds (22 projects). This report focuses on the 306 projects under the IBRD/IDA&#13;
and Special Financing product lines for which we have the greatest amount of&#13;
information. Of these, approximately half, or 151 projects, were in two regions:&#13;
AFR and LAC. EAP and MNA had the smallest number of education projects&#13;
during this time period. Of the 306 education projects under the IBRD/IDA and&#13;
Special Financing product lines managed by the Education Sector Board, 166&#13;
supported some form of student assessment activity.9 Approximately the same&#13;
number of assessment related projects was supported in AFR, LAC, ECA, and&#13;
SAR, while EAP and MNA had the smallest number of projects that provided&#13;
support for student assessment activities during this time period (Figure 1).&#13;

  At the time of the Larach and Lockheed report, the Bank used four regional classifications: Africa; Asia;&#13;
Latin America and Caribbean (LAC); and Europe, Middle East, and North Africa (EMENA).&#13;
9&#13;
  All ICRs for completed projects managed by the Education Sector Board between 1998 and 2009 were&#13;
reviewed to identify projects that introduced support for an assessment activity following original&#13;
project approval. Through this review, three such projects were identified: Uruguayâ&#128;&#153;s Second Basic&#13;
Education Quality Improvement Project (P041994), Cape Verdeâ&#128;&#153;s Education and Training Consolidation&#13;
and Modernization Project (P055468), and Tajikistanâ&#128;&#153;s Education Reform Project (P057953). It appears&#13;
that introducing an assessment activity into a project after project approval is possible, although it has&#13;
not been done very often.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                      ECA had the largest proportion of education projects (81 percent)&#13;
                                 supporting some form of student assessment activities. Nearly all ECA countries&#13;
                                 are former socialist economies with impressive educational legacies, including&#13;
                                 high average levels of educational attainment. As these countries have&#13;
                                 transitioned, their education systems have needed to adjust to the new demands&#13;
                                 of free market economies. Student assessment reform has been a key ingredient&#13;
                                 in this adjustment process.&#13;

                                 Education projects supporting assessment activities were relatively evenly split&#13;
                                 between LICs (90 projects) and MICs (76 projects) (Figure 2).&#13;
                                     Approximately 12 percent of the MICs that qualified for World Bank&#13;
                                 funding had a Bank supported education project in place between 1998 and 2009;&#13;
                                 20 percent of the LICs qualifying for World Bank funding had an education&#13;
                                 project in place during the same time period. Of those countries with education&#13;
                                 projects, 54 percent of MICs and 61 percent of LICs had projects that supported&#13;
                                 student assessment activities.&#13;

&amp;#12;    The number of MICs that qualify for Bank funding has increased over time&#13;
while the number of LICs has decreased. Yet even as countries transition to&#13;
higher income classifications, they have continued to seek assistance from the&#13;
Bank to develop their education systems in general, and their student assessment&#13;
systems in particular.&#13;
&#13;
As a percentage of total commitments for education projects supporting&#13;
student assessment activities, commitments for student assessment activities&#13;
have continued to increase over time.&#13;
&#13;
Between 1998 and 2009, the World Bank made over $11.8 billion in financial&#13;
commitments towards education projects that supported student assessment&#13;
activities.10 Althoughâ&#128;&#148;after borrowing country governmentsâ&#128;&#148;the Bank&#13;
appeared to be the largest funder of assessment activities in developing countries&#13;
during this time period (based on the 166 Bank education projects supporting&#13;
student assessment activities that we reviewed), numerous multilateral and&#13;
bilateral donors, including the U.K. Department for International Development&#13;
(DFID), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the U.S. Agency for&#13;
International Aid (USAID), also contributed sizeable amounts (over $4 billion).&#13;
     Overall, between 1998 and 2009, at least $60 billion was committed by the&#13;
various multilateral and bilateral organizations, country governments, and&#13;
private foundations toward education projects that, at least in part, supported&#13;
the development of countriesâ&#128;&#153; student assessment systems. Projects in LICs&#13;
received 78 percent of these commitments (approximately $47 billion) and&#13;
projects in MICs received 22 percent (approximately $14 billion). In terms of&#13;
regional comparisons, commitments for education projects that supported&#13;
student assessment activities were greatest in SAR and lowest in EAP and MNA&#13;
(Figure 3).&#13;
     Information on specific financial commitments for assessment related&#13;
activities was available for 109 (66 percent) out of the 166 projects reviewed. For&#13;
those 109 projects, 37 percent of the project commitments typically was allocated&#13;
for assessment activities. Both the number of projects that include specific&#13;
financial information on assessment activities as well as the size of the&#13;
commitment for those activities have increased since the time of the Larach and&#13;
Lockheed report.&#13;

  The World Bank used a variety of lending instruments for these education projects. Specific Investment&#13;
Loans (SIL) were the most commonly used, followed by Adaptable Program Loans (APL). This is&#13;
consistent with the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s overall portfolio distribution by the different lending instruments (World&#13;
Bank, 2009a). The lending instruments finance projects through credits, loans, and grants. The majority of&#13;
education projects in LICs were financed by credits (particularly in AFR and SAR, where almost all&#13;
education projects were financed through credits). Education projects in MICs, however, were primarily&#13;
financed by loans, with LAC countries receiving the highest number of loans.&#13;

                            Only 23 (26 percent) of the 90 projects reviewed by Larach and Lockheed&#13;
                       had budget figures for student assessment activities. For those 23 projects, on&#13;
                       average, less than 2 percent of the project cost (and in turn, allocated&#13;
                       commitments) was for assessment initiatives.&#13;
                            LICs received substantially more financing for education projects that&#13;
                       included support for assessment activities than MICs, and a much larger&#13;
                       percentage of the financing received by LICs went towards actual assessment&#13;
                       activities (Figure 4).&#13;

highest proportion of commitments allocated for assessment related activities,&#13;
with 61 percent and 22 percent, respectively, of total project commitments&#13;
allocated to supporting assessment activities (Figure 5).&#13;

    Over time, donor (both World Bank and other) commitments for education&#13;
projects supporting assessment activities have been relatively flat except for&#13;
spikes caused by funding allocations for a few large projects, primarily in India&#13;
and Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
Actual financing closely followed planned financing for education projects&#13;
supporting student assessment activities.&#13;
&#13;
In order to understand how much financing actually was provided for projects&#13;
supporting assessment activities, 81 ICRs of closed projects were reviewed for&#13;
financing data. Overall, actual financing from all sources for closed education&#13;
projects supporting assessment activities closely followed the initial financial&#13;
commitments for those projects, with 93 percent of planned financing, or&#13;
approximately $26 billion of the $28 billion of upfront commitments, disbursed&#13;
(Table 2).&#13;

                        Borrowing country governments provided 70 percent, or $18 billion, of the&#13;
                   approximately $26 billion total financing for education projects supporting&#13;
                   assessment activities. The World Bank provided the next largest amount of&#13;
                   financing, with approximately $6 billion contributed to education projects&#13;
                   supporting assessment activities.&#13;
                        Analyzing closed education projects by country income classification, LIC&#13;
                   governments committed the highest amount of financing at the project appraisal&#13;
                   stage (67 percent of total allocation) and provided the greatest amount of&#13;
                   financing by project completion (77 percent of total actual financing). MICs, on&#13;
                   the other hand, were allocated and received approximately equal proportions of&#13;
                   financing from the World Bank and from their own country governments (Table 3).&#13;

&#13;
                   Of the 81 closed projects for which ICRs were available, 64 provided information&#13;
                   on the upfront financing commitments for assessment activities, and 34 of those&#13;
                   also included information on the actual financing of assessment activities.11 For&#13;

&amp;#12;these 34 projects, the actual financing closely followed financial commitments.&#13;
Specifically, 10.3 percent of planned financing was committed to assessment&#13;
activities, and 9.8 percent of financing was actually disbursed to complete project&#13;
assessment activities.&#13;
     LICs were allocated and received the highest amount of financing for&#13;
assessment activities. In terms of regional comparisons, countries in AFR&#13;
received the most financing for assessment activities, although the greatest&#13;
amount of financing for assessment activities was initially committed to&#13;
countries in SAR.&#13;
&#13;
There are distinct patterns and trends in the types of student assessment&#13;
activities supported in World Bank education projects between 1998 and 2009.&#13;
&#13;
Level of the Education System&#13;
Overall, most education projects provided support for assessment activities at&#13;
the primary level. Support for assessment activities at the secondary level was&#13;
the next most popular area of focus. Few projects (nine in total) provided support&#13;
for assessment activities at the tertiary level.&#13;
     In MICs, education projects that supported assessment activities were&#13;
equally likely to focus on assessment activities at the primary or secondary&#13;
levels, while projects carried out in LICs were more likely to provide support for&#13;
assessment activities at the primary level.&#13;
     In almost all regions, the project focus was on supporting assessment&#13;
activities at the primary level. In ECA, however, the main focus was on&#13;
supporting assessment activities at the secondary level.&#13;
&#13;
Quality Drivers&#13;
A great variety of assessment related activities was supported by World Bank&#13;
education projects between 1998 and 2009. Despite this variety, all of the&#13;
activities had the ultimate goal of strengthening the countryâ&#128;&#153;s assessment system&#13;
in one of three areasâ&#128;&#148;the enabling context, system alignment, or assessment&#13;
qualityâ&#128;&#148;with an eye to thereby improving the quality of the information on&#13;
student learning and achievement being produced by that system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
education projects in AFR, 1 of 3 closed education projects in EAP, 9 of 18 closed education projects in&#13;
ECA, 7 of 21 closed education projects in LAC, 4 of 5 closed education projects in MNA, and 7 of 19&#13;
closed education projects in SAR provided information on committed and actual financing for&#13;
assessment activities.&#13;

&amp;#12;      Box 1: Quality Drivers of an Assessment System&#13;
      Enabling context: The enabling context refers to the broader context in which the assessment&#13;
      activity takes place and the extent to which that context is conducive to, or supportive of, the&#13;
      assessment. It covers such issues as the legislative or policy framework for assessment activities;&#13;
      institutional and organizational structures for designing, carrying out, or using results from the&#13;
      assessment; the availability of sufficient and stable sources of funding; and the presence of&#13;
      trained assessment staff.&#13;
      System alignment: System alignment refers to the extent to which the assessment is aligned with&#13;
      the rest of the education system. This includes the degree of congruence between assessment&#13;
      activities and system learning goals, standards, curriculum, and pre- and in-service teacher&#13;
      training.&#13;
      Assessment quality: Assessment quality refers to the psychometric quality of the instruments,&#13;
      processes, and procedures for the assessment activity. It covers such issues as design and&#13;
      implementation of assessment activities, analysis and interpretation of student responses to those&#13;
      activities, and the appropriateness of how assessment results are reported and used.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Across most regions, and in both LICs and MICs, project support was&#13;
     primarily focused on enabling context related activities, followed by system&#13;
     alignment activities. This is consistent with the Larach and Lockheed finding that&#13;
     the focus in the projects they reviewed was on improving the â&#128;&#156;institutional&#13;
     qualityâ&#128;? aspect of the assessment system. Improving the quality of the&#13;
     instruments and procedures used in assessment exercises continued to receive&#13;
     the least support in these assessment related projects.&#13;
&#13;
     Types of Assessments&#13;
     Projects also supported at least one of three types of assessments: classroom&#13;
     assessments, examinations, or large scale, survey type assessments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Box 2: Types of Assessments&#13;
     Classroom assessments, also known as continuous or formative assessments, are those carried&#13;
     out by teachers and students in the course of daily activity in order to provide real-time&#13;
     information to support teaching and learning in individual classrooms.&#13;
     Examinations, which are typically standardized, are high-stakes assessments used to make&#13;
     decisions about individual students, particularly with regard to progression through the education&#13;
     system (for example, promotion to the next grade level, graduation from high school, and&#13;
     entrance to university).&#13;
     Large-scale, survey-type assessments are used to inform education policy and practice by&#13;
     providing information on performance at the system level and related contributing factors. These&#13;
     assessments may be subnational, national, or international in nature.&#13;
     Source: Clarke (2012).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14                                                                Julia Liberman and Marguerite Clarke&#13;
&amp;#12;     Overall, large scale assessments were the most common type of assessment&#13;
activity to be supported in education projects across both LICs and MICs, and&#13;
across all regionsâ&#128;&#148;except for MNA, where classroom assessment was the&#13;
primary focus of project support. In contrast, Larach and Lockheed found that at&#13;
least 33 percent of Bank projects with assessment activities provided support for&#13;
activities related to examinations, with Africa and Asia having the largest&#13;
number of such projects (46 and 44 percent of their education projects,&#13;
respectively) at that time. Only 21 percent of the projects reviewed by Larach and&#13;
Lockheed supported large scale assessment activities focused on monitoring&#13;
overall student performance, with EMENA and LAC having the most such&#13;
projects. However, Larach and Lockheed also noted that support for large scale&#13;
assessments was increasing and support for examinations was declining. It is&#13;
now evident that the trend that Larach and Lockheed observed in the early 1990s&#13;
has continued through to the present day, and that the focus on examinations,&#13;
while still important, is no longer the main priority.&#13;
     Project support for assessment activities also included support for country&#13;
participation in international large scale assessments. This support was most&#13;
common for countries in the ECA region. No countries in AFR or SAR received&#13;
support for participation in international large scale assessments. Across all&#13;
regions, MICs were more likely than LICs to receive support for participation in&#13;
international large scale assessments.&#13;
     With regard to support for participation in specific international large scale&#13;
assessment exercises, a similar number of education projects supported country&#13;
participation in TIMSS or PISA; far fewer projects supported participation in&#13;
PIRLS.&#13;
&#13;
There are distinct regional patterns and trends in the types of student&#13;
assessment activities supported in World Bank education projects between&#13;
1998 and 2009.&#13;
&#13;
    While most countries had one or two education projects supporting student&#13;
assessment activities during this time period, some countries had three or more&#13;
projects. The latter set of countries could be found in every region of the Bank,&#13;
except for the MNA region (Figure 6).&#13;

&amp;#12;Trends in the Africa Region&#13;
Of the 77 education projects in the AFR region approved by the Board of the&#13;
World Bank between 1998 and 2009, 41 (spread across 26 countries) supported&#13;
some form of student assessment activity. Most of these projects provided&#13;
support for assessment activities at the primary level (36). Just under half (18)&#13;
provided support for activities at the secondary level. Only two provided&#13;
support for activities at the tertiary level. Large scale, survey type assessments&#13;
were the most common type of assessment activity to be supported, closely&#13;
followed by examinations. This represents a change since the 1980s and early&#13;
1990s, when a sizeable portion of assessment related support in AFR was for&#13;
public examinations used for student selection and certification decisions. No&#13;
country in AFR has received support for participation in an international large&#13;
scale assessment, such as TIMSS, PIRLS, or PISA. In the AFR region, assessment&#13;
related projects typically focused on helping countries put in place the enabling&#13;
conditions for an effective assessment system, including creating or&#13;
strengthening assessment units in ministries of education and providing some&#13;
form of staff training.&#13;
&#13;
Trends in the East Asia and Pacific Region&#13;
Between 1998 and 2009, the World Bank supported 32 education projects in the&#13;
EAP region, 12 of which included assessment activities. The main focus of these&#13;
12 projects, which were spread across eight countries, was supporting countries&#13;
to develop their policy, institutional, and human resource environments for the&#13;
successful functioning of their student assessment systems. System alignment&#13;
and assessment quality issues also were a focus for many of the projects. The&#13;
support provided under these 12 projects mainly focused on developing&#13;
assessment systems at the primary level. Additionally, most of the assessment&#13;
related project support was directed towards large scale assessment activities.&#13;
Although minimal, participation in international large scale assessments also&#13;
was supported, with one project in Mongolia supporting participation in TIMSS&#13;
and another project in Indonesia supporting participation in TIMSS, PISA, and&#13;
PIRLS.&#13;
&#13;
Trends in the Europe and Central Asia Region&#13;
In the ECA region, of the 43 projects approved by the Board of the World Bank&#13;
between 1998 and 2009, 35 supported student assessment activities. Spread&#13;
across 21 countries, these projects focused on supporting countries to build their&#13;
policy, institutional, and human resource environments for the successful&#13;
functioning of their student assessment systems. Alignment of assessments with&#13;
other aspects of the education system also received some support, as did&#13;
activities focused on improving the quality of the assessment instruments.&#13;
Projects mainly provided support for assessment activities at the secondary level.&#13;
While significant support also was provided for assessments at the primary level,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Review of World Bank Support for Student Assessment Activities in Client Countries, 1998â&#128;&#147;2009   17&#13;
&amp;#12;     no project provided support for assessment at the tertiary level. Projects&#13;
     provided the most support for large scale assessments, followed by classroom&#13;
     assessment and examinations. A total of 19 projects also supported participation&#13;
     in one or more of the three largest international large scale assessmentsâ&#128;&#148;TIMSS&#13;
     (13 projects), PIRLS (5 projects), and PISA (14 projects).&#13;

     Out of 74 projects in the LAC region managed by the Education Sector Board&#13;
     from 1998 through 2009, 34 supported assessment activities across 19 countries.&#13;
     These activities primarily focused on further developing the enabling context for&#13;
     student assessment systems in these countries. Project support most frequently&#13;
     focused on assessments at the primary level, followed by support for assessment&#13;
     activities at the secondary level. Projects primarily supported large scale&#13;
     assessments of student achievement levels, which is consistent with the trend&#13;
     that LAC was experiencing from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. Significantly fewer&#13;
     projects provided support for classroom assessment or examinations. Projects also&#13;
     provided support for countries to participate in international large scale assessment&#13;
     exercises, with two projects, one in El Salvador and one in Uruguay, supporting&#13;
     participation in TIMSS; a project in Uruguay supporting participation in PISA; and&#13;
     another project in Nicaragua supporting participation in PIRLS.&#13;
&#13;
     Trends in the Middle East and North Africa Region&#13;
     In the MNA region, of the 29 projects managed by the Education Sector Board&#13;
     from 1998 through 2009, 12 supported assessment activities. These projects,&#13;
     spread across eight countries, focused on helping countries to align their&#13;
     assessments with other aspects of their education systems. Projects provided&#13;
     similar amounts of support for assessment at the primary and secondary levels.&#13;
     Classroom assessment was the most frequently supported assessment activity&#13;
     under these projects, followed closely by large scale assessments. Participation in&#13;
     international large scale assessments such as TIMSS, PISA, and PIRLS also was&#13;
     supported. TIMSS was the most frequently supported international assessment,&#13;
     with two projects in Jordan, one project in Djibouti, and one project in Tunisia&#13;
     providing support for participation in this assessment.&#13;
&#13;
     Trends in the South Asia Region&#13;
     Between 1998 and 2009, of the 51 projects managed by the Education Sector&#13;
     Board in the SAR region, 32 supported the development of student assessment&#13;
     systems. These projects, spread across eight countries, primarily supported&#13;
     activities focused on improving the alignment between assessment and other&#13;
     aspects of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s education system. The projects also provided a fair&#13;
     amount of support for developing the enabling context for assessment activities&#13;
     in these countries as well as for improving the quality and use of assessment&#13;
     instruments. Most of the 32 projects supported assessment activities at the&#13;

&amp;#12;primary level; fewer than half supported activities at the secondary level.&#13;
Projects mainly provided support for large scale assessment activities, followed&#13;
by classroom assessment. No support was provided for participation in&#13;
international large scale assessments.&#13;

&#13;
Challenges&#13;
Although many World Bank education projects that provided support for&#13;
assessment activities achieved their goals in this area (for an example of one such&#13;
project in Pakistan, see Box 3), it was not uncommon for projects, by their&#13;
closing, to have planned assessment related activities that either were not&#13;
implemented or had not implemented as well as intended due to a variety of&#13;
challenges faced during project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Box 3: The Pakistan National Education Assessment System Project&#13;
The Pakistan National Education Assessment System (NEAS) project focused on addressing all&#13;
three quality drivers of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s student assessment system. The project primarily focused on&#13;
strengthening the enabling context to ensure institutionalization and sustainability of the NEAS, and&#13;
also engaged in activities to improve system alignment and assessment quality. The development&#13;
objectives of the NEAS project were to: (i) design and administer assessment mechanisms; (ii)&#13;
establish administrative infrastructure and capacity for assessment administration, analysis, and&#13;
report writing; and (iii) increase stakeholder knowledge and acceptance of assessment objectives&#13;
and procedures.&#13;
Enabling context. By the end of the project, a good administrative infrastructure had been&#13;
established at the National and Provincial levels from a zero baseline. National and Provincial&#13;
management committees had been established to provide advice and support decision making in&#13;
the NEAS. All operating costs related to the conduct of the assessments were being financed&#13;
under the governmentsâ&#128;&#153; regular budget. A detailed review had been conducted of the options&#13;
available for institutionalization, including options for establishing the NEAS as a credible and&#13;
autonomous institution, and a Task Force had been set up for this purpose. A medium-term,&#13;
capacity-building program and implementation plan had been developed. A document presenting&#13;
the Government of Pakistan's long-term vision for assessments and quality of education also had&#13;
been drafted. Partnering relationships had been established with one international and two national&#13;
institutions. This partnership substantially contributed to the development of national capacity to offer&#13;
specialized courses in assessments. Forty people completed a Masters degree in education, 33&#13;
received short-term training of 3â&#128;&#147;4 months, 168 persons were offered World Bank Institute (WBI)&#13;
courses conducted in Pakistan, and 1,680 were trained through various workshops conducted in the&#13;
country.&#13;
System alignment. By the end of the NEAS project, the new curriculum had been translated into&#13;
measurable learning competencies as an input to future NEAS assessments to be based on this&#13;
curriculum.&#13;
Assessment quality. Disseminating assessment findings was an integral part of the NEAS project.&#13;
Four rounds of large-scale, sample-based student assessments (for grades 4 and 8) and one&#13;
round of equating studies (for two subjects in grade 4) were successfully completed and shared&#13;
with stakeholders. The four rounds of assessment contributed to raising awareness and increasing&#13;
stakeholder knowledge about assessments. Based on the national assessmentâ&#128;&#153;s findings, NEAS&#13;
prepared, with the support of education experts, a set of recommendations for education policy&#13;
makers and implementers. These recommendations were widely shared with all relevant education&#13;
stakeholders for review and implementation.&#13;

Review of World Bank Support for Student Assessment Activities in Client Countries, 1998â&#128;&#147;2009               19&#13;
&amp;#12;        The types of challenges typically faced by such projects (based on IEG and&#13;
     ICR evaluations) span three categories: operational, political, and technical.&#13;
     Examples of typical challenges under each category include the following:&#13;
&#13;
     Operational issues&#13;
         x Lack of clear and strong leadership in the country to provide authority,&#13;
           vision, and direction to support the implementation of assessment&#13;
           activities&#13;
         x Lack of up front prioritization of the specific work to be done to&#13;
           implement assessment activities as well as delays in putting in place the&#13;
           necessary implementation and partnering arrangements&#13;
         x Misalignment between project indicators and project inputs pertaining&#13;
           to assessment activities&#13;
         x Poor selection and management of consultants for effective and timely&#13;
           project implementation&#13;
         x No or inappropriate budget provision for implementation of&#13;
           assessment activities, leading to insufficient funds for covering all&#13;
           aspects of the planned assessment work&#13;
&#13;
     Political issues&#13;
         x Minister of education changing four times during the lifespan of the&#13;
           project&#13;
         x Unforeseen threats to a countryâ&#128;&#153;s national security that prevented&#13;
           international consultants and firms from providing continued project&#13;
           support&#13;
         x Teachers union opposition to student assessments and evaluations&#13;
         x Parental pressure that prevents or slows the introduction of new&#13;
           assessments&#13;
         x National election preventing the carrying out of an assessment exercise&#13;
&#13;
     Technical issues&#13;
         x Limited capacity of staff responsible for participating in the&#13;
           implementation of assessment activities, which was not accounted for in&#13;
           project preparation&#13;
         x Inappropriate design and use of assessments for achieving stated&#13;
           assessment goals&#13;
         x Use of assessments that are not relevant for a particular country&#13;
         x Unclear technical guidelines and standards for carrying out student&#13;
           assessment activities&#13;
         x Lack of data against which to judge whether assessment objectives have&#13;
           been achieved&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;     Recognizing and mitigating the risks associated with these common&#13;
challenges during project preparation may help avoid or reduce the impact of&#13;
similar issues in future projects and ensure more effective implementation of&#13;
assessment activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Good Practices&#13;
Completed projects were reviewed to identify common factors that contributed&#13;
to successful project implementation. The evidence base for identifying such&#13;
factors is greater today than at the time of the Larach and Lockheed report. Of&#13;
the 98 closed World Bank education projects that supported some form of&#13;
assessment activity between 1998 and 2009, 68 have ICRs that are a rich source of&#13;
lessons learned. In contrast, at the time of the Larach and Lockheed report, only&#13;
23 Project Completion Reports were available for 26 closed projects.&#13;
     The identified good practices cover the project lifespan, from preparation&#13;
through implementation and completion.&#13;
&#13;
Project Preparation&#13;
Identify key stakeholders and ensure that they are directly involved in project&#13;
preparation. The design of the collaboration between the partners involved in&#13;
project preparation (and, ultimately, implementation) should be consistent with&#13;
national challenges and concerns as well as with the needs and priorities of the&#13;
country. The partnership can include many groups, such as government, civil&#13;
society, donors, and the private sector.&#13;
     Include assessment related objectives in the project results framework.&#13;
Because assessment initiatives, and the capacity building activities associated&#13;
with those initiatives, are typically important project objectives, they need to be&#13;
incorporated into the results framework. Thus, key assessment related output&#13;
and outcome indicators, as well as their respective baseline and target values,&#13;
should be identified. These indicators must be monitored throughout project&#13;
implementation and reported on at the end of the project.&#13;
     Set realistic targets for score increases. Student assessment results are often&#13;
used as indicators to gauge improvements in education equity and quality as a&#13;
result of project supported interventions. To ensure that the use of assessment&#13;
results for gauging progress in these areas is reasonable and appropriate, it is&#13;
important to identify and set realistic, measurable, and verifiable targets based&#13;
on the test scores or score gains. It also is important to ensure that scores have&#13;
been equated over time, that any proficiency levels have been validated, and that&#13;
the population of students assessed is comparable over time.&#13;
     Obtain consensus and buy in from stakeholders on key assessment related&#13;
objectives. To ensure both the short and long term success of the assessment&#13;
initiative, there needs to be broad consensus among the key stakeholders about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Review of World Bank Support for Student Assessment Activities in Client Countries, 1998â&#128;&#147;2009   21&#13;
&amp;#12;     objectives. Stakeholders must participate in setting and delivering the&#13;
     assessment related objectives. It also is important to determine who will be&#13;
     responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting information on results as&#13;
     clear responsibilities will help ensure accountability. An important stakeholder&#13;
     in this discussion is the country government, as its ownership of the project is&#13;
     vital in order for it to be implemented successfully. The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     commitment should include a plan or agreement on the allocation, management,&#13;
     and timelines of fund disbursements, including triggers for release of tranches&#13;
     specifically for assessment work to ensure that implementation of assessment&#13;
     activities is not hindered by delay or misallotment of funds. Another important&#13;
     stakeholder group is teachers. Teacher representatives should be included in the&#13;
     design phase of any project that will support assessment. Otherwise, during&#13;
     project implementation, teachers may fear the assessment initiatives because they&#13;
     do not understand their intended purpose or because they worry that the&#13;
     assessment will be used unfairly as an instrument of accountability. Buy in from&#13;
     this stakeholder group is especially important as teachersâ&#128;&#153; commitment to newly&#13;
     introduced assessment activities is essential if these activities are to positively&#13;
     impact learning. Although ownership and sustainability are promoted by&#13;
     stakeholder consultation and participation during the early stages of project&#13;
     preparation, stakeholder participation at all stages of the project is imperative for&#13;
     optimizing results.&#13;
          Evaluate the existing infrastructure and implementation capacity for&#13;
     carrying out assessment related activities. It is important to evaluate local&#13;
     capacity to accomplish assessment related goals within the proposed project&#13;
     timeframe and budget. This includes identifying and addressing any&#13;
     institutional constraints and capacity building requirements. Examples of key&#13;
     infrastructure include physical space and, especially for large scale assessments&#13;
     and examinations, the necessary information technology management to&#13;
     facilitate accurate and efficient processing of student assessment information. It&#13;
     also is important to identify what additional or back up infrastructure will be&#13;
     needed to ensure that the project can still be carried out even in the event of&#13;
     changes in government, staffing, or other major events. Additionally, it is&#13;
     important to conduct an evaluation of existing capacity to conduct student&#13;
     assessment activities in the country. While a country may be willing and&#13;
     committed to develop many areas of its student assessment system, activities&#13;
     supported by the project should take into account the given capacity to carry out&#13;
     such activities in the country. It is possible that the required capacity can be built&#13;
     with the support of the project; however, it is necessary to first understand the&#13;
     countryâ&#128;&#153;s existing capacity limitations to evaluate which assessment activities the&#13;
     project can realistically support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22                                                       Julia Liberman and Marguerite Clarke&#13;
&amp;#12;During Project Implementation&#13;
Develop local capacity, particularly in areas where local staff will be required to&#13;
continue assessment activities after the closing of the project. â&#128;&#156;No matter how&#13;
many high powered international consultants are made available, a project&#13;
cannot succeed without sufficient numbers of capable middle level managersâ&#128;?&#13;
(Boissiere et al. 2007); therefore, attention must be paid to deepening and&#13;
broadening the capacity of local management and staff to carry out assessment&#13;
activities. This capacity development will help ensure sustainability of the&#13;
assessment related changes post project completion. Building the capacity of&#13;
teachers in developing or using newly introduced assessment approaches is also&#13;
important. It therefore may be useful to develop handbooks and kits for teachers&#13;
on developing (if applicable), using, and understanding student assessments and&#13;
assessment results.&#13;
     Regional and international study tours, as well as partnerships with local&#13;
and international universities and centers of expertise, can, if used judiciously,&#13;
help build local human capital and provide access to international human&#13;
capital. Study tours can expose the future country experts to key national and&#13;
international best practices and help them form critical links for continued&#13;
exchange and learning.&#13;
     Include representative samples of schools and students in large scale&#13;
assessment exercises. While not every student has to participate in a large scale&#13;
assessment exercise, it is necessary to have a sample of students that is&#13;
representative of the target population. This sample must be large enough to&#13;
provide information that is valid and reliable for policy makers. Using a sample&#13;
of students versus complete coverage of the population offers reduced costs&#13;
associated with gathering and analyzing the data, reduced requirements for&#13;
trained personnel to conduct the fieldwork, improved speed in most aspects of&#13;
data summarization and reporting, and greater accuracy due to the possibility of&#13;
more intense supervision of fieldwork and data preparation operations.&#13;
     Disseminate assessment results to key stakeholders in a timely manner.&#13;
Assessment findings must be reported and acted upon by key stakeholders,&#13;
including policy makers, administrators, and teachers. Findings should be&#13;
communicated and acted upon as soon as possible following data collection&#13;
because long delays reduce the usefulness of the assessment exercise. The time&#13;
frame for communicating results will differ by the type of assessment and its&#13;
purpose. Regardless of assessment type, the reporting, whether it is in written or&#13;
oral form, should be clear, concise, and comprehensive so that it is understood&#13;
by the audience for which it is intended.&#13;
&#13;
Following Project Completion&#13;
Develop a plan for ensuring sustainability after project completion. In order to&#13;
ensure that the project has lasting impact, it is important to plan ahead of time&#13;
for who or what organization will continue to promote and work on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Review of World Bank Support for Student Assessment Activities in Client Countries, 1998â&#128;&#147;2009   23&#13;
&amp;#12;     assessment agenda introduced or supported by the project. Therefore, it is&#13;
     necessary to prioritize post project sustainability upfront when planning for how&#13;
     to develop a countryâ&#128;&#153;s student assessment system, given that following project&#13;
     completion there will be fewer resources, both fiscal and human capital, to&#13;
     support the project. Sustainability of the assessment system at the&#13;
     national/subnational level is essential to ensure lasting impact, and it is therefore&#13;
     necessary to identify the right next steps and define their ownership.&#13;
          These examples of challenges and good practices in implementing student&#13;
     assessment activities in World Bank education projects provide lessons that Bank&#13;
     staff and country teams can use to inform the design of future projects that&#13;
     support the development of student assessment systems. In addition to learning&#13;
     from these past experiences, Bank staff and country teams also can draw on a&#13;
     new set of tools that has been developed by the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s SABER Student&#13;
     Assessment team to assist in policy dialogue on student assessment as well as in&#13;
     the design and preparation of new projects incorporating support for student&#13;
     assessment activities.12 These tools, which draw on the latest evidence for what&#13;
     matters most for student assessment systems,13 and include a set of standardized&#13;
     questionnaires, rubrics, and a country report template, provide an evidence&#13;
     based and structured approach to discussing the strengths and weaknesses of&#13;
     any assessment system, possible next steps and priorities for reform, and&#13;
     reasonable medium and long term targets for achieving change.14&#13;

&#13;
     Conclusion&#13;
     This paper addressed some key trends and issues in World Bank support for&#13;
     student assessment activities in client countries between 1998 and 2009.&#13;
          Although the information provided is instructive, there is a need for&#13;
     additional research and analysis to support the ongoing information needs of&#13;
     Bank staff and client countries in this area. For example, additional lessons could&#13;
     be learned from analyzing World Bank support for student assessment activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     12&#13;
        The tools were developed under the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Systems Approach for Better Education Results&#13;
     (SABER) program, which helps countries systematically examine and strengthen the performance of&#13;
     their education systems to achieve learning for all. The SABER Student Assessment domain, one of the&#13;
     subsystems within the SABER program, is a World Bank initiative to benchmark learning assessment&#13;
     policies and systems in developed and developing countries around the world, with the goal of&#13;
     promoting stronger assessment systems that contribute to improved education quality and student&#13;
     learning. The SABER Student Assessment domain is supported by the Russia Education Aid for&#13;
     Development (READ) Trust Fund, a program that is executed by the World Bank in close consultation&#13;
     with the Russian Federation. The READ Trust Fund supports strengthening the capacity of countriesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
     institutions to assess student learning and to use the information from assessments to improve teaching&#13;
     and learning.&#13;
     13&#13;

&amp;#12;through other funding modalities, including recipient executed projects and trust&#13;
fund programs. It also would be valuable to learn from the experiences of other&#13;
donors and global agencies in this area. In addition, regional and country&#13;
specific analyses would add considerable richness to our understanding of what&#13;
works in what context. No doubt, as the dialogue on student assessment&#13;
continues to evolve, so too will the need for identification and in depth&#13;
evaluation and analysis of good practices in designing and implementing&#13;
student assessment projects and other reforms in support of improved education&#13;
quality and learning outcomes.&#13;
