            The author proposes three types of
            anticorruption strategies: those that reduce the benefits
            that officials control, those that increase the costs of
            bribery, and those that limit the bargaining power of
            officials. In essence, fighting corruption involves
            introducing more competition, privatizing government
            activities, and introducing greater transparency.
