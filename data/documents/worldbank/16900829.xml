tional or international sanitation goals in Lao PDR, nor is a&#13;
national monitoring framework that tracks both government&#13;
and development partner activity in the sector. This makes&#13;
sector planning and coordination very difficult, since donor&#13;

ners are supporting sanitation and hygiene promotion in just                             10&#13;
over half, and most projects operate on a fairly small scale,&#13;
covering only selected villages rather than entire districts.&#13;
Typically these projects support the installation of a single                             5&#13;
technology option: the pour-flush toilet with a soak pit lined&#13;
with three concrete rings. This design is very popular, but&#13;
also fairly expensive: over US$100 if a durable super-struc-                              0&#13;

This approach to sanitation promotion has three critical weak-&#13;

â&#128;¢	 it makes it very difficult for private masons and suppliers to       one quarter spent around LAK5.5 million (US$614) (see&#13;

In remote locations, where many of communities are poor,                large numbers of poor households to build their own facili-&#13;
the cost of installing improved sanitation is even higher due to        ties, more affordable technology options would need to be&#13;
the problem of materials supply. Seasonal limitations in water          available.&#13;
supply can also affect the viability of pour flush toilets.&#13;

            Lao PDR - Findings from hygiene and
            sanitation financing study in Lao PDR
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In Lao People's Democratic Republic
            (PDR), poor sanitation and hygiene causes at least three
            million disease episodes and 6,000 premature deaths
            annually. Diarrheal disease is, in fact, tied with pneumonia
            as the second largest killer of children under five. Poor
            sanitation also contributes significantly to water
            pollution, adding to the cost of accessing safe and clean
            drinking water. The consequences go even further. A recent
            study by the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program
            (WSP) found that in 2006, the country lost an estimated
            LAK1.9 trillion (US$193 million) due to poor sanitation and
            hygiene, equivalent to 5.6 percent of Gross Domestic Product
            (GDP). Strengthening planning and accelerating progress in
            sanitation and hygiene could yield substantial benefits, not
            just for the economy but by prolonging life and improving
            the future for the people of Lao PDR.  In Laos, very little
            information is available on how much money is being spent on
            sanitation and hygiene, by which entities, for what
            purposes, or in what locations. There is also little
            information on who benefits from this expenditure. This
            study aims to present an overview of the current status of
            sanitation and hygiene financing and to provide useful
            information and recommendations that can help strengthen
            planning and accelerate progress in sanitation and hygiene.
            This Research Brief summarizes the mains findings of the
            study in Lao PDR.
