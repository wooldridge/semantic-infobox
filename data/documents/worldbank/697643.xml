AMOUNT          US$16.8 million, equivalent&#13;
TERMs           17 years, including 5 years grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate&#13;
PROJEr&#13;
OBJECIvEs       The proposed project constitutes the second phase of a long-term Government&#13;
program to modernize tax administration. It is based on the concept developed for&#13;
a pilot project currently under implementation supported by the International&#13;
Monetary Fund. The overall purpose of the proposed project is to help develop and&#13;
install an effective and efficient national system of tax administration. The specific&#13;
objectives of the project are: (i) to implement the second phase of the long-term&#13;
program of the STS in 2 regions with about 1 10 local offices through reorganization&#13;
of structures and procedures, automation, and staff training; and (ii) to assist in the&#13;
institutional development of tax administration by building the capacity of the STS,&#13;
preparing for nation-wide implementation of tax administration reforms, and&#13;
providing project management support.&#13;
PROJEcr&#13;
DEscREPToN      Reorganization and Procedures. The proposed project would introduce a functional&#13;
organization in the STS local offices and simplify procedures by adopting a self-&#13;
assessment system and instituting a system for selective audits. Taxpayer education&#13;
would be introduced through staff dedicated to this purpose and the organization of&#13;
seminars and development of literature.&#13;
Automation. The project would computerize the processing of major federal taxes&#13;
for legal entities, including the value-added tax (VAT) and profit tax which account&#13;
for two-thirds of current federal tax revenues; simnplify tax forms to make them more&#13;
useable; and finance the acquisition and installation of computer and ancillary&#13;
hardware for two regional offices and about 110 local offices.&#13;
Staff Training. The project would finance the development and application of staff&#13;
training programs in the areas of taxpayer education, audit, default tax collection and&#13;
computerization for about 3500 staff of the STS.&#13;
Organizational Development of the STS. The proposed project would finance the&#13;
costs of preparing to reorganize the tax administration system; develop a strategy for&#13;
inter-agency cooperation; design a strategy for taxpayer education; prepare a national&#13;

implementation plan; develop a national staff training plan; and review the legal and&#13;
regulatory framework of the Russian tax system.&#13;
Preparation for Nationwide Implementation. The proposed project would also&#13;
finance the costs of preparing for full national implementation of tax administration&#13;
reforms. This would include development of standards and guidelines; a national&#13;
automation plan; feasibility studies on individual income taxes; and a comprehensive&#13;
implementation plan.&#13;
Project Implementation Support. The project would finance the operation of a&#13;
Project Management Unit to coordinate project implementation.&#13;
RATIONALE&#13;
FOR BANE&#13;
INVOLVEMENT    The proposed project would make a direct contribution to the Bank's objectives of&#13;
financing high-priority public sector investments.  The project focusses on&#13;
institutional development of an organization, the STS, that is key to stable fiscal&#13;
management and indispensable for an effective system of public finance.&#13;
sENEiTrs         The proposed project would enable the STS to cope with its vastly increased&#13;
workload. The project is designed to achieve better: (i) effectiveness of tax&#13;
administration through automation, a national audit strategy and better management&#13;
information systems; (ii) fairness in the system by enabling the application of more&#13;
uniform treatment; and (iii) efficiency through streamlined procedures resulting in&#13;
faster processing of tax payments and returns as well as ability to cope with&#13;
increasing workload with little or no increase in staff. The project would help&#13;
expand the tax base through better registration and taxpayer education and would help&#13;
increase compliance by lowering the private costs of compliance and raising the costs&#13;
of non-compliance. All these achievements would lead ultimately to increased tax&#13;
revenues without increasing tax rates.&#13;
RISKS            The proposed project alone cannot guarantee increased revenues without parallel&#13;
action to improve tax legislation policies. In addition, conditions outside the project&#13;
could prevent it from realizing its full benefits, such as unproductive changes in tax&#13;
legislation. Within the project, implementation could be compromised by logistical&#13;
difficulties in delivery and installation of equipment. Overall, the phased approach&#13;
of the project helps cope with these risks by permitting adjustments in design based&#13;
on lessons from experience in the pilot project. In the final analysis the greatest risk&#13;
is loss of potential revenues without the project; the STS would not have sufficient&#13;
institutional capacity to capture new revenues as the private sector grows and the tax&#13;
base expands.&#13;

CHAPrER 1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    Progressive improvement in macro-economic stability is a critical condition for the development&#13;
of a sound market economy in Russia. A key condition for stabilization is to reduce the budget deficit,&#13;
in part through additional revenue measures. These require improved collection of a number of taxes,&#13;
particularly the value-added tax (VAT) and profit tax, which account for more than two-thirds of&#13;
government tax revenues at the federal level. More generally, with the move toward privatization and&#13;
a vigorous market-oriented economy, the share of revenues collected from state-owned enterprises is&#13;
expected to decline and those collected from the growing private sector should increase considerably,&#13;
provided tax compliance can be enforced adequately for these new taxpayers. Overall tax revenues are&#13;
falling in conjunction with the decline in enterprise production. Onerous tax rates on enterprises must&#13;
be reduced and collections increased from an expanding tax base.&#13;
1.2   In this context the Government and IMF have developed a pilot project in two local tax offices&#13;
to begin the modemization of tax administration. The results are expected to provide a basis for tax&#13;
administration reform on a wider basis. The Government has approached the Bank to finance the&#13;
extension of the pilot project to about 110 local offices in two regions. A detailed project proposal was&#13;
prepared for this purpose.2 The Bank evaluated the proposal and found that the proposed project is&#13;
justified for Bank financing because it:&#13;
a.     addresses priority problems (Chapter 3);&#13;
b.     fits within an overall program for tax administration reform (Chapter 4);&#13;
c.    takes into account lessons from prior Bank experience and accords with Bank strategy&#13;
(Chapter 5);&#13;
d.     has priority objectives and needed content (Chapter 6);&#13;
e.     has reasonable costs and a feasible implementation plan (Chapter 7);&#13;
f.     would confer important benefits in tax mobilization (Chapter 8); and&#13;
g.    the risks are limited and are worth taking (Chapter 8).&#13;
Following an explanation of the current tax system in Chapter 2, these points are elaborated in sequence&#13;
in subsequent chapters.&#13;

CHAPTER 2. THE SECIOR SETIING&#13;
A.    Tax Policy Development&#13;
2.1    The Russian Government has achieved significant advances towards adapting its tax system to the&#13;
requirements of a market economy, and the transformation is taking place in face of daunting obstacles.&#13;
Much remains to be done, however. A prime constraint to further reforms towards a market-oriented&#13;
system is the lack of qualified tax administration resources and systems capable of reducing taxpayer&#13;
burden, providing professional auditing and delinquent collection.&#13;
2.2    Considerable progress has been made in improving tax policies since 1991 when Russia initiated&#13;
its transition to a market-oriented economy. Tax reforms started in December 1991 with the enactment&#13;
of the legislation on "Basic Principles of the Taxation System," and the introduction of the value-added,&#13;
individual income, and excise taxes, and continued with the creation of several additional taxes during&#13;
1992. VAT introduction led to significant improvement of the tax system particularly in regard to&#13;
economic efficiency. In 1993 the VAT contributed about 7% of GDP and represented 24% of the tax&#13;
revenue. Similarly, introduction of the profit tax constituted a major improvement of the tax system.&#13;
In 1993 the profit tax contributed about 10% of GDP and represented 36% of the tax revenue.&#13;
2.3    Despite the progress achieved since 1990, the current tax system fails to generate sufficient tax&#13;
revenues and fosters distortions. Tax revenues as a percentage of GDP had declined from 34% in 1992&#13;
to 30% at the end of the second fiscal quarter in 1994. Large exemptions, poor accounting methods, and&#13;
delays in acceptance of investment credits remain as unresolved problems. While the value-added and&#13;
profit taxes are by far the most important revenue generators, both suffer from structural problems related&#13;
mainly to inadequate inflation adjustment, excessive tax concessions, arbitrary restrictions on cost&#13;
deductions, and generous tax holidays. Different than in OECD countries, personal income tax plays a&#13;
minor role and is plagued with exemptions and allowances which erode its revenue potential. The&#13;
development of the new tax system faces many obstacles, including the rapid growth in the number of&#13;
taxpayers, the level of inflation, rising crime, and structural weaknesses at the STS.&#13;
2.4    The Government recently decided to reform the tax system over a three-year period. The&#13;
objectives of the reform are: (i) to improve the revenue perfornance of the current tax system; (ii) to&#13;
reduce distortions; and (iii) to favor administrative effectiveness. The guiding principles are to simplify&#13;
the existing regime, to broaden the tax base, and to reform the taxation of natural resources, energy in&#13;
particular.&#13;
2.5    The first steps in this direction are scheduled to be implemented in 1995.  They include&#13;
eliminating a series of taxes accruing to sectoral extrabudgetary funds, as well as a number of "nuisance"&#13;
taxes, and streamlining exemptions.  In parallel, steps are being taken to clarify the taxpayers&#13;
responsibilities; the rights and obligations of each level of government; the respective roles of the&#13;
legislative and executive branches of government in introducing, abolishing and modifying taxes; and to&#13;
rationalize the sanctions applicable for tax evasion. Finally, a first step towards the reform of the&#13;
personal income tax and excess wage tax are also scheduled to take place in 1995. However, much&#13;
remains to be done and the bulk of reforms, including the reform of taxation of natural resources, are&#13;
scheduled to take place in 1996-97.&#13;

2.6    The reform in the design of the tax system and the modernization of the tax administration are&#13;
mutually supporting. The simplification of the tax regime facilitates its administration. In turn, a&#13;
stregthened administation will improve tax collection and the continuing reform of the desipn of the tax&#13;
system.&#13;
B.     The Tax Administraton System&#13;
1. Background&#13;
2.7    Traditionally  the tax  system  in Russia has been decentralized.   Regional and  local&#13;
offices-reporting to financial departments at the respective levels-functioned mainly to control profit&#13;
transfers and monitor results of state-owned enterprises. In early 1991 the Government introduced a new&#13;
finanial system basing govermnment expenditures on a market-oriented system of tax collections. The&#13;
Stfte Tax Service (STS) was created in 1991 as a part of the Ministry of Finance. Subsequently, in&#13;
November 1991, the STS became an independent structure with ministerial status.&#13;

2.8    The STS is charged with managing and supervising virtually all types of taxation in Russia.3 Tax&#13;
policy remains primarily the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance, although the STS plays an&#13;
important role in helping to shape policy by providing feedback on the experiences in implementing tax&#13;
policies. Initially the STS also performed the functions of criminal enforcement; however, in 1993 part&#13;
of the STS enforcement capacity was separated to create an independent Tax Police Department to carry&#13;
out investigative and criminal work. The STS has three levels of administration: the federal level, 89&#13;
regional (oblast) offices and 2770 local (rayon) offices. Chart 2.1 shows the organization of the tax&#13;
administration system.&#13;
2.9    The main function of the STS is to implement and enforce Russian tax legislation. The federal&#13;
level is responsible for overall tax administration. The federal level manages the work of the regional&#13;
offices, which in turn manage the local offices. Legally, regional and local offices report to the head&#13;
office. The heads of regional offices are appointed by the head of the STS. Staff in the regional and&#13;
local offices are also employed and paid by the STS. Regional and local administrations have the&#13;
authority to define regional and local taxes to be administered by the corresponding regional and local&#13;
offices; however, the federal level is responsible for ensuring that taxes are administered consistently.&#13;
Each year the federal level evaluates the performance of various regional offices, and regional offices&#13;
'audit" the performance of local offices. Actions are taken if subordinate offices are not following STS&#13;
standards and guidelines. Functions by level within the STS are shown in Table 2.1&#13;
2.10   The division of labor between the center and regions is not always understood or practiced. Staff&#13;
at the center tend to become engaged in small routine activities or regional problems at the expense of&#13;
work or policy development, information exchange and supervision.&#13;
2.11   In November 1993, the Government reviewed the taxation system and assigned the following&#13;
priority functions to the STS:&#13;
a.     Ensure comprehensive registration of legal entities and individuals for collection&#13;
purposes;&#13;
b.     Ensure the complete and timely collection of tax payments;&#13;
c.     Enhance compliance and a reduction of the volume of taxes in default;&#13;
d.     Improve techniques for analyzing statistics and forecasting tax revenues;&#13;
e.     Develop a comprehensive computerization program for tax administration;&#13;
f.     Modernize tax administration organization and procedures; and&#13;
g.     Ensure proper training of staff for the streamlined administrative functions.&#13;
Chart 2.2 shows the organizational structure of the STS at the federal level. The structure of a regional&#13;
tax inspectorate is shown in Chart 2.3. There are traditionally two types of organizational structures for&#13;
local (rayon) tax offices. The first is structured according to geographical location of taxpayers (i.e. all&#13;
taxpayers in one area are assigned to a given unit). The second is structured according to type of&#13;
taxpayer (i.e. enterprise, individual, etc.) These are shown in Charts 2.4 and 2.5, respectively.&#13;
3 Notable exceptions are customs duties and taxes, and social security taxes, e.g. pensions.&#13;

3. Types of Taxes&#13;
2.13 In all, the STS is responsible for administering the collection of 17 types of taxes at the national&#13;
level; 3 taxes at the regional level; and over 20 types of taxes at the local level (see Attachment 1). As&#13;
shown in Chart 2.6, below, in the first quarter of 1994 the four largest federal taxes accounted for the&#13;
following shares of total federal tax revenues: profit tax, 419%; Value-Added Tax (VAT), 27%; income&#13;
taxes, 14%; and excise taxes, 5%.&#13;

Financing&#13;
2.14   The main source for financing materials improvements in the STS system has boen the 'social&#13;
development fund." The social development fund is meant to cover costs of office renovations and&#13;
construction, purchase of hardware/software, transportation improvements and other social needs of the&#13;
offices. Regional offices determine how to utilize the funds within their jurisdiction. The social&#13;
development fund provides about 60% of the non-salary budget funds for tax offices. The social&#13;
development fund was financed until recently from penalties and interest collected from taxpayers. Local&#13;
tax offices kept 30% of penalties, 10% of interest collected, and 10% of any additional revenues raised&#13;
as a result of auditing activities and these amounts were shared between headquarters, regional and local&#13;
offices. This system gave the wrong incentives. A new system of financing was passed by the Duma&#13;
in late 1994 allowing the STS to retain up to 3/4ths of 1% of all revenues collected which will be&#13;
allocated by the center to regions for capital and operating expenses on the basis of need. The new&#13;
system eliminates the perverse incentives implicit in the former method of financing and is expected to&#13;
provide sufficient resources to support planned tax modemization.&#13;

4. Information Technology System&#13;
2.15   Information technology management. Like the STS, the management of information technology&#13;
is also decentralized. Because priority has been given in general to achieving collection targets set by&#13;
the government, the agency followed a pragmatic approach in coordinating the development of application&#13;
systems; hardware, software, and communications architectures; the support organization; and information&#13;
technology standards.  In 1992 the STS adopted a computerization program  for 1992-1995. Its&#13;
implementation has resulted in the development and introduction of applications for processing tax&#13;
information, and provided tax offices with computing equipment. Nevertheless, as offices attempt to&#13;
increase their ability to cope with the workload, disparate systems have been created at the local office&#13;
level. The proliferation of differing information technology systems and procedures will continue and&#13;
perhaps increase unless a strong central program offering superior alternatives is put in place.&#13;
2.16   Hardware. Local and regional tax offices are estimated to be equipped with about 35% of the&#13;
computerization program target for hardware, with the total figure across the tax administration system&#13;
being about 22,000 computers of differing capacities. The computer equipment is being utilized under&#13;
a number of different, non-coordinated, and often incompatible hardware architectures. These include&#13;
over 800 local area networks (LANs), mainly from Novell, multi-user computing complexes based on&#13;
"OS VM\386" and "OS PICK", as well as a number of stand alone computers. These investments have&#13;
been financed by the social development fund. For instance, over 1992 - 1993 approximately 22,000&#13;
million Rubles were spent within the STS system on computerization, of which 85 % was contributed by&#13;
the regional state tax inspectorates (STIs).&#13;
2.17   Most of the STS's existing tax-processing systems are based on LANs with a data server and a&#13;
number of microcomputers. An exception to the rule has been St. Petersburg where the regional office,&#13;
with assistance from the Danish government, is developing a mini-computer based tax processing system.&#13;
Unfortunately, the high cost and level of sophistication of this solution makes it inappropriate for&#13;
nationwide deployment. Elsewhere, existing hardware is typically of low quality, not up-to-date, but is&#13;
being used effectively to perform priority tasks.&#13;
2.18   Tax applications software. A large number of tax processing applications has been developed&#13;
by regional and local offices throughout the territory of the Russian Federation. These application systems&#13;
cover primarily taxpayer registration, verification of correct and timely submission of tax-related&#13;
payments by taxpayers, keeping of taxpayers' individual accounts, and generation of statistics on the&#13;
dynamics of tax collections. These systems can be found at over half of the local tax offices and&#13;
practically all of the republican, krai, oblast, and okrug-level inspectorates.&#13;
2.19    These applications were developed without standards regarding development tools, data bases,&#13;
data definition, or even a common interpretation of the rules for processing of taxes. There is a risk that&#13;
this type of decentralized applications development may lead to uneven applications of tax and tax&#13;
administration policies throughout the Federation. Tax application software was developed incrementally&#13;
and to varying standards, quality and internal controls. Some regional and local offices have their own&#13;
internal capability for information technology (IT), but systems development was primarily by&#13;
contractors. In general, current systems lack the benefit of global standards for tax processing and the&#13;
quality that can be provided by an expert systems designer. Moreover, current systems reflect a tax&#13;
administration organization and processing procedure that is not adequate for a market economy; existing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Techxical Annex&#13;

systems do not integrate tax processing functions, do not provide for proper auditing, and do not generate&#13;
effective management information. Furthermore, uncoordinated development has resulted in excessive&#13;
costs for systems development and maintenance, increased the diversity of tax administration policies and&#13;
procedures, and caused uneven treatment of taxpayers.&#13;
2.20   Communications.  Little use is made of telecommunications facilities as most data processing&#13;
activities take place at the local tax office. Some large oblasts, such as the Moscow oblast, have plans&#13;
to use ordinary telephone lines to transmit management information from the local offices to the regional&#13;
office, primarily for collection of statistics. Today, diskettes are the most common means of digital&#13;
communication, but the use of telecommunications facilities is increasing as the option becomes available&#13;
throughout the Russian Federation. Statistics are commonly made available in paper form and lack in&#13;
detail for analysis.&#13;
2.21   Information technology st4fflng. The STS has a small central information technology staff of&#13;
about 20 technical specialists. Most information technology services are contracted out to a semi-&#13;
governmental agency. It is estimated that country-wide some 1,800 technical specialists (or about 1%&#13;
of the STS labor force) provide support for data processing activities including the training of tax&#13;
inspectors and clerical staff in concepts and use of computer systems.&#13;
5. STS Staff Trining&#13;
2.22   Training is planned centrally and implemented both centrally and locally. In addition to a central&#13;
staff of about 30 members in charge of planning and coordination, the STS has three training centers.4&#13;
The central staff prepared the annual training budget, the annual training plan and coordinates training&#13;
activities at the central and local levels. On the basis of consultation with the various regional offices&#13;
about their training needs, as well as the available budget for the year, the central STS staff provides&#13;
regional offices with a list of courses to be offered under contract by almost two dozen institutions in the&#13;
next fiscal year as well as with the number of training places allocated to each region. Management of&#13;
the STS regional offices nominates participants for these various courses. In addition, local offices are&#13;
encouraged to organize and finance additional training activities. In 1993 over 20,000 individuals&#13;
participated in training activities ranging from 2 days to 3 months, and a similar volume of training is&#13;
planned for 1994. Most of this traiing is related to accounting and auditing techniques. At present,&#13;
international collaboration with the STS on training matters is coordinated by an International Tax&#13;
Training Institute (para. 4.11), which organizes about 15 two-week courses each year.&#13;
'St. Petersburg with 57 trainers and 800 trainees in 1993; Nizhny Novgorod with 54 trainers and 1300 trainees in 1993:&#13;
and Kaluga. The first two provide courses on profit tax and individual income tax; the latter specializes in computer&#13;
training.&#13;

CHEAPTR 3. PROBLEMS  AND ISSUES IN TAX ADMNISRTION&#13;
3.1    The introduction of the new tax system in 1991 and 1992 was made without allowing the STS&#13;
sufficient time and resources to prepare appropriate systems, accounting procedures, training and&#13;
information programs for taxpayers. The processing of tax returns and payments was mostly done&#13;
manually, procedures for processing returns and detecting delinquent taxpayers varied by office and&#13;
efforts were duplicated because organizations were built mostly along a "type of tax" structure.5&#13;
3.2    The main challenge facing the STS is to change its operations from one designed to deal with a&#13;
small number of large and trusted taxpayers (state enterprises whose returns were verified for arithmetic&#13;
mistakes) to a large number of new and relatively small taxpayers (private enterprises whose returns need&#13;
to be checked systematically for under-reporting). Consequently, tax administration systems must change&#13;
and processing capacity must be greatly increased.&#13;
A.     Expanded Workload&#13;
3.3    The number of taxpayers (legal entities) has grown from  1.3 million in 1992 to 2.2 million in&#13;
early 1994. In addition, most taxpayers must file multiple advance payments and returns. Compared&#13;
with 1992, 450,000 additional VAT returns and 3.6 million profit tax returns are expected in 1994; and&#13;
1.4 million and 10.8 million additional advance payments for VAT and the profit tax, respectively. The&#13;
dimensions of the workload problem are shown in Table 3.1.&#13;

The STS does not have the capacity to cope with its increased responsibilities and workload owing to&#13;
problems in organization and procedures; inadequate processing capacity and lack of adequately trained&#13;
staff.&#13;
B.     Organization and Procedures&#13;
3.4    Effective tax administrations usually organize themselves around the principal functions of the&#13;
business. The different functions then receive focussed attention, thereby facilitating achievement of&#13;
quality through depth. Local tax offices, however, lack a functional specialization. They tend to be&#13;
organized by geographical location of taxpayer or by type of taxpayer. Under this structure each unit&#13;
performs taxpayer registration, desk verification of tax returns and field audits, handling of delinquent&#13;
taxpayers, etc. This system requires tax inspectors to be knowledgeable in a wide range of fields, and&#13;
leads to delay, duplications of functions and inadequate quality. Similar to the local and regional offices,&#13;
the STS central office is organized by the type of tax payer and type of tax (Chart 2.1). Also, this&#13;
organizational structure does not provide adequate support services for lower levels. Moreover, the size&#13;
of the central office is limited legally to about 600 staff.&#13;
3.5    Current processing procedures derive from the former command economy with relatively few and&#13;
large enterprises. Taxpayers were required to visit the local office to have their returns verified. Tax&#13;
inspectors-assigned about 200-300 enterprises each-then performed a desk review. This was a&#13;
laborious, staff-intensive process that slowed collections and imposed a burden on the taxpayer. With&#13;
a growing workload tax inspectors are unable to deal effectively with each taxpayer. Such desk reviews&#13;
are often ineffective and fail to detect under reporting. The assignment of inspectors to specific&#13;
enterprises can also invite abuse.&#13;
3.6    Little effort is made in educating taxpayers of their responsibilities and what procedures to follow.&#13;
Inadequate public knowledge about taxpayer responsibilities, together with frequent changes in tax&#13;
legislation and regulations, means that even those taxpayers who want to comply cannot easily do so.&#13;
Tax seminars, guides, information pamphlets could enhance compliance and eliminate the need for&#13;
mandatory visits. A post audit would be sufficient.'&#13;
3.7    The private costs of compliance could also be reduced through simplification of tax forms. Tax&#13;
forms tend to be complicated, requesting unnecessary information. Moreover, there is no unique way to&#13;
identify taxpayers, apart from using their business names. Taxpayers need to be assigned a unique&#13;
taxpayer identification number (TIN) so as to facilitate processing and communications.&#13;
C.    Inadequate Processing Capacity&#13;
3.8    The inadequate capacity of the STS to process returns poses costly constraints on the capture of&#13;
new revenues as the. private sector grows and the tax base expands. Payments are often processed&#13;
manually, or with outdated computing equipment. Local offices, to cope with increasing workloads, tend&#13;
to purchase hardware and software and develop their own solutions. Since 1992 local offices have spent&#13;

about US$12 million from the social development fund (para. 2.12) to purchase hardware and software.&#13;
However, this has been done without uniform standards or guidelines. Different configurations and&#13;
different computerization of tax processes result.&#13;
3.9    Lack of effective automation means delays in processing payments and loss of revenue. Lack of&#13;
automation also makes it difficult to detect deviations efficiently, e.g. "stopfilers" and late payments.&#13;
Manual detection is made impractical by the continuous increase in the number of taxpayers and the&#13;
variation in filing and payment frequencies depending on taxpayer liability.' The lack of automation also&#13;
contributes to the inability to develop a computerized audit strategy for targeting the most promising cases&#13;
for inspector reviews.&#13;
3.10   Lack of consistent automation also means difficulties in generating accurate and timely&#13;
information needed to manage the system as a whole. Manually generated statistics tend to be time-&#13;
consuming, slow to produce and unreliable. As a result, the system lacks the capacity to produce vital&#13;
information for system management purposes, such as to predict revenue generation or detect areas where&#13;
revenues fall below potential.&#13;
3.11   A related issue is the strain the increased volume of transactions is placing on the banking sector.&#13;
Commercial banks are bearing the brunt of processing an ever greater volume of tax payments. At&#13;
present, commercial banks receive no financial compensation for timely processing of tax payments.&#13;
Control is lax over the transfer of funds into Government accounts.&#13;
D.    Lack of Adequately Trained Staff&#13;
3.12   For the current activities of the STS, training gaps already exist at various levels of the system.&#13;
The most obvious and important gap concerns the nature and level of training in accounting. At present,&#13;
there are at least three systems of accounting in Russia, the traditional one, a Western-type system of&#13;
accounting being adopted by government agencies and typical Western-type systems adopted by private&#13;
firms. Most of the STS employees, typically graduates from schools of economics, are not familiar with&#13;
these accounting systems. A second, and pervasive training gap is related to tax-specific information,&#13;
particularly knowledge of legislation and regulations. There are dozens of taxes, and in the present&#13;
system tax officials are responsible for all of them. Keeping abreast of legislation and fast changing&#13;
regulations is a daunting task, particularly when no adequate system exists for compiling legislation and&#13;
regulations. Moreover, most of the legislation and regulation are subject to ambiguity and controversy.&#13;
A third, and obvious training gap, is in the area of auditing, since there is virtually no tradition of&#13;
auditing in the country, and most of the existing accounting systems do not allow a proper audit.&#13;
Associated with the lack of technical skills in auditing is the pervasive lack of investigative and&#13;
negotiation skills. The introduction of a modern tax administration will require even further skills&#13;
associated with automation and new work procedures, thereby accounting is the prevailing training gap.&#13;
7 For example, VAT taxpayers need to file a tax return monthly or quarterly depending on their VAT liability; some&#13;
VAT taxpayers need to make payments every 10 days, others monthly or quarterly.&#13;

CHAPER 4. STRATEGY AND PROGRAM&#13;
A.    Strategy for Tax Modernization&#13;
4.1    The Government has developed an overall strategy with IMF assistance to address the above&#13;
problems and create an effective and efficient tax administration system. The strategy integrates reforms&#13;
in organization and procedures, automation and human resource development. The strategy calls for a&#13;
carefully phased approach, based on learning from implementation experiences. It starts with the&#13;
introduction of one key tax-the VAT-for a target population of 200 taxpayers in two local offices,&#13;
progressively phases in more taxpayers in these two locations, then adds the remaining major federal&#13;
taxes for legal entities on a limited scale, covering two more regions fully, and finally scales up within&#13;
six years to incorporate all key taxes and locations in Russia. A development team at the central level&#13;
provides impetus for the reforms with implementation taking place at local offices and their respective&#13;
regions. A premium is placed on evaluation of actual results and building from experiences. Experiences&#13;
gained with the actual implementation of tax administration reforms would be used to adjust the national&#13;
strategy. Even before reforms can be financed in regions not covered by the early phases, the strategy&#13;
calls for the provision of standards and norms to guide the consistent development of activities at lower&#13;
levels. Given the difficulties of working in the uncharted and changing Russian context, this approach&#13;
permits time to learn and build capacities towards national coverage.&#13;
B.    Programs for Tax Administration Refor m&#13;
4.2    The STS has developed a long-range, integrated program with the assistance of the IMF and other&#13;
donors, to implement its strategy for modernization of tax administration. The elements of the program&#13;
are to:&#13;
a.     Develop national guidelines and standards on tax modernization to promote consistency&#13;
of approach and facilitate systems integration;&#13;
b.     Introduce a functional organizational structure at all levels of the system;&#13;
c.     Introduce modern procedures such as taxpayer "self-assessment"8 and targeted auditing&#13;
of selected tax returns;&#13;
d.     Automate tax processes and develop telecommunications;&#13;
e.     Strengthen the staffing numbers (with an authorization to reach a total of 200,000 for the&#13;
system as a whole);&#13;
f.     Train and retrain staff; and&#13;
g.     Establish a national management information system.&#13;
4.3    A national system of tax administration is to be achieved in four distinct phases, as shown in&#13;
Table 4.1.&#13;
a In which the taxpayer determines his/her tax liabilities without the intervention of tax officers and the tax&#13;
administration accepts the taxpayers' determination subject to verification in post audits.&#13;

1. Plot Project (1992-1994)&#13;
4.4    The first phase, currently under implementation with IMF and EC assistance, involves a smnall&#13;
pilot project to modernize the administration of the VAT in two local offices. The pilot aims to develop&#13;
and test a new organizational structure, procedures, automation design and staff training programs that&#13;
can be used as models for wider application.&#13;
4.5    The pilot project costs US$2.1 million, of which the EC is financing US$1.1 million, the IMF&#13;
US$0.6 million for technical assistance and the STS US$0.4 million. Two regional offices (Moscow&#13;
Municipality and Moscow Oblast) with one local office each (Taganka and Lubertsy, respectively)&#13;
participate in the pilot project. The pilot project seeks a complete modernization of tax administration&#13;
of these two offices, starting with VAT collection on a limited scale.&#13;
4.6    The pilot project integrates the following reforms at two local offices: organizational change,&#13;
taxpayer education to facilitate introduction of a self-assessment system, automation of tax processes, staff&#13;
training, and establishment of normal business practices with banks for collection purposes.  The&#13;
following outputs are expected from the pilot project by its completion in May 1995:&#13;
a.     Four hundred enterprises will have sent representatives to seminars, understood and&#13;
adopted the principle of self-assessment, registered for the VAT and been assigned a&#13;
taxpayer identification number (TIN);&#13;
b.     A new functional organization will have been introduced in the local offices specializing&#13;
staff in functions of taxpayer education, data processing, audit and default recovery of&#13;
taxes;&#13;
c.     Thirty-six staff will have been trained in the above functional areas;&#13;
d.     Procedures will have been developed for registering taxpayers; receiving and capturing&#13;
infornation from tax returns and payments; auditing and audit guidelines; handling&#13;
recovery of taxes in default;&#13;
e.     The following electronic data processing systems will have been introduced:&#13;
0      VAT registration system;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

o      automated processing of payments and returns, including calculation of penalty&#13;
and interest, and generation of taxpayer notice;&#13;
°      automated detection of stopfilers and late payments;&#13;
O      computerized audit selection criteria; and&#13;
o      on-line enquiry system to access taxpayer data, including the generation of&#13;
management information statistics;&#13;
f.     A local area network (LAN) will have been installed in each pilot project local office and&#13;
regional office, complete with workstations, file servers, printers and software; and&#13;
g.     A memorandum of understanding will have been concluded with commercial banks&#13;
defining the responsibilities of the bank (e.g. norms for submitting tax payments to local&#13;
offices and for transferring funds to government accounts) and the STS (e.g.&#13;
compensation to banks for their services.)&#13;
4.7    Development of the Pilot Project started in February 1993; its implementation started on July 1,&#13;
1994 and is currently underway. The project management group is in place, taxpayers have been selected&#13;
(200 from each location), organizational changes have been approved, staff have been allocated to the new&#13;
functions, staff training has commenced, hardware/software has been installed in the project sites and the&#13;
application of software is underway. The processes and results are being evaluated continuously by the&#13;
project team.&#13;
4.8    The pilot project is expected to provide a foundation for expansion to other types of taxes and&#13;
other regions of the country. The organization, procedures and systems could be adapted to support other&#13;
taxes without undue difficulty. Many of the new tax forms can be used with minor adaptations for other&#13;
types of taxes, such as registration forms, assessment notices, reminder/warning letters. Many of the&#13;
procedures do not depend on the type of tax and therefore could be used in the future, such as procedures&#13;
for registering taxpayers, receiving and processing returns and payments. Most of the computer logic&#13;
has been designed to support a variety of taxes. Software to process tax returns would be essentially the&#13;
same, for example uniform method for calculating penalty and interest, generation of assessment notices,&#13;
verification of advance payments. Software to detect stopfilers and late payments has been designed to&#13;
work for most taxes. In addition, the database structures have been designed to support different types&#13;
of taxes. As a result, scaling up to include additional types of taxes is not expected to present undue&#13;
difficulties.&#13;
2. Phase 2 (1995-1997)&#13;
4.9    The second phase of the program seeks to introduce modernized tax administration to a larger&#13;
number of tax offices across Russia and prepare for nationwide implementation. It involves the following&#13;
elements:&#13;
a.     Expansion to include (i) all VAT taxpayers in both pilot project offices and (ii)&#13;
introduction of profit tax in the two pilot offices on a limited scale;&#13;
b.     Introduction of full tax administration reform and automation in two regions and about&#13;
110 local offices in two new regions;&#13;
c.     In parallel with the above, development of a national strategy for modernizing tax&#13;
administration, national guidelines for tax administration, national system architecture,&#13;
a national staff training plan and a national audit plan;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

d.    Expansion of the data processing system to include all major federal taxes for legal entity&#13;
taxpayers; and&#13;
e.    Investigation of the possibility of including taxation of individuals.&#13;
3. National Implementation (1997-2000)&#13;
4.10   Full national implementation would take place in two additional phases. The third phase (1997-&#13;
98) would expand coverage into 25 additional regions including approximately 1000 local offices. These&#13;
regions would be selected to account for the bulk of revenue collections. The final phase (1999-2000)&#13;
would reach the remaining 62 regions and 1600 local offices in more remote areas.&#13;
C.    Donor Assistance&#13;
4.11   In addition to assistance provided under the pilot project, the STS receives assistance from a&#13;
variety of other donors mostly focussed on training of tax officials. Tax seminars have been sponsored&#13;
in Russia by the IMF, Danish tax administration, Swedish Ministry of Finance, German government and&#13;
the IRS of the United States, among others. The Danish tax administration, OECD and EC have&#13;
provided assistance in establishing an International Tax Training Center in Moscow. The Center started&#13;
its operations in September 1993 and approximately 15 courses have been given to date. The STS has&#13;
decided that the Center would be responsible for establishing a coherent framework for bilateral and&#13;
multilateral technical assistance for training. USAID has agreed to provide additional funding for the&#13;
Center, and to collaborate with the Soros Foundation in developing computer-assisted instruction for&#13;
officials of the STS. In addition, the German govermnent and Danish tax administration have provided&#13;
assistance to the STS in computerization. The German government has provided a loan to purchase&#13;
hardware and software for regional offices. The Danish tax administration is assisting the STS in&#13;
improving computerization in the St. Petersburg area.&#13;
D.    Constraints on Program Implementation&#13;
4.12   Successful implementation of the project depends on overcoming key organizational and staffing&#13;
constraints. The structure adopted for implementing the pilot project provides useful experience, but the&#13;
STS has not been properly organized at headquarters to support program implementation on a large scale.&#13;
Few Government agencies outside military industries have experience in implementing comprehensive&#13;
projects involving several interrelated components. Traditionally, Government agencies conducted&#13;
bureaucratic paper work but had little experience on managing project funds. The situation in the STS&#13;
is even more challenging because it is a relatively new organization and must operate in a difficult,&#13;
changing environment. The organizational structure of the STS (chart 2.2) does not lend itself to efficient&#13;
project management because departmental responsibilities for different types of tax makes coordination&#13;
difficult. There is little experience beyond the pilot project with proper advance planning of activities,&#13;
division of responsibilities, clear operational procedures and close supervision of results. In particular,&#13;
the STS lacks experience in international procurement and in managing the work-of external consultants.&#13;
Staff are capable, but need to be reallocated to implementation duties and retrained for new functions.&#13;
Clear standards and guidelines need to be developed and enforced to ensure coherent implementation.&#13;

CHAPTER S. LESSONS OF EXPERmENCE AND BANK STRATEGY&#13;
A.    Lessons of Experience&#13;
5.1    Stand-alone tax administration modernization projects are relatively few in the Bank and most&#13;
have become effective within the past two years. Relevant examples for this project include Hungary,&#13;
the Philippines, Thailand, Jamaica, and Argentina. These were developed with IMF assistance based on&#13;
experience with tax computerization in industrialized countries. Experience in advanced countries has&#13;
demonstrated the potential to achieve: (i) faster, more accurate and inproved tax processing, auditing,&#13;
and collections; (ii) improved taxpayer compliance; (iii) improved reporting due to the expectation that&#13;
computers will detect errors; and (iv) a better managed tax system, providing accurate information at the&#13;
central and regional levels, which can facilitate better budgetary planning.&#13;
5.2    Best project design invariably has three common characteristics: (i) projects bring a high level&#13;
of automation to tax administration activities, not only to gain efficiency in the process of returns and&#13;
payments, but above all to improve taxpayer compliance, auditing and collections; (ii) projects include&#13;
parallel changes in the organizational structure of the tax administration agency to take full advantage of&#13;
investments in technology and training, and to better support data processing, auditing and collections&#13;
functions; and (iii) projects include a comprehensive training component to support implementation and&#13;
provide long-term sustainability.&#13;
5.3    Project designs also recognize the strong influence that tax policies play on the actual tax&#13;
administration activities. For example, small variations on thresholds can affect data processing volumes&#13;
substantially. Inclusion of extraneous data collection for statistical purposes can affect document entry&#13;
time, and hence efficiency and productivity of staff. Changes in legislation or regulations can have&#13;
profound influence on application systems. What appear to be simple changes can render whole&#13;
application systems obsolete. Keeping systems up-to-date and disseminated to regional and local offices&#13;
to maintain uniformity require costly logistics and coordination.&#13;
5.4    The Hungary operation has now been effective for about fifteen months and is progressing&#13;
smoothly, but supervision reports indicate that new computerized tax systems cannot be implemented&#13;
efficiently or effectively without significant improvements in tax returns, payment forms, and tax&#13;
administration policies and procedures. Computerization strategies must focus on implementing tax&#13;
administration reforms rather than simply automating current processes and systems, or merely adding&#13;
computer capacity. Moreover, IMF and Bank experience points to the need to try out reforms on a&#13;
limited scale, and make corrections on the basis of problems detected, before proceeding with large-scale&#13;
implementation of modernization programs.&#13;
'In the U.S. the number of additional tax returns filed as a result of enforcement activities increased from 689,000 to&#13;
3.6 million over a 6 year period by pursuing delinquent taxpayers with the use of computers.&#13;

B.    Bank Role and Strategy&#13;
5.5    The main objectives of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) are to: (i) support the&#13;
development of a market-oriented economy based on private sector initiatives; (ii) the provision of&#13;
physical, social, legal and institutional infrastructure not normally provided through the private sector;&#13;
and (iii) finance high priority public sector investments. The proposed project is fully consistent with the&#13;
CAS. It focusses on institutional development of an organization, the STS, that is a key to stable fiscal&#13;
management and indispensable for an effective system of public finance. By financing the modernization&#13;
of the State Tax Service, the Bank would contribute to increasing revenues without increasing tax rates;&#13;
ensure the continuity and sustainability of the revenue increases; and facilitate voluntary compliance&#13;
through a perception of fairness and the application of tax laws.&#13;

CHAPTR 6. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Objectives&#13;
6.1    The overall purpose of the project is to help develop and install an effective and efficient national&#13;
system of tax administration. The proposed project would create the infrastructure needed to collect and&#13;
process intended tax revenues at reasonable a cost and speed from an expanding tax base. The project&#13;
has two main objectives:&#13;
a.     To implement the second phase of the long-term program of the STS in 2 regions with&#13;
about 110 local offices through: (i) reorganization of structures and procedures, (ii)&#13;
automation, and (iii) staff training; and&#13;
b.    To assist in the institutional development of tax administration by (i) building the capacity&#13;
of the STS, (ii) preparing for nationwide implementation of tax administration reforms,&#13;
and (iii) providing project management support.&#13;
To achieve the above objectives, the proposed project would finance (i) expert services (Russian and&#13;
international), (ii) staff training, (iii) acquisition of hardware and software, and (iv) minor upgrading of&#13;
offices to accommnodate computerization.&#13;
B.    Project Description&#13;
6.2    The proposed project consists of two main components: (i) implementation of Phase 2 of the tax&#13;
administration program, and (ii) institution development, as explained below.&#13;
1. Phase 2 of Tax Administration Modernization (US$19.2 milion of base costs)&#13;
6.3    Overiew. The proposed project would extend the structures, management and operational&#13;
procedures, and automation systems developed in the pilot phase to two new regions inclusive of about&#13;
110 local offices. In addition to the VAT, the project would introduce automation of all major federal&#13;
taxes for legal entities in these regions.&#13;
6.4    The STS has selected the Nizhny Novgorod and Volgograd regions for inclusion in the project.&#13;
Table 6.1 provides dimensions of these regions.&#13;
6.5    The choice of these regions was made by the STS on the basis of the following criteria: potential&#13;
tax revenues; similarity to other regions to be included in the next phase; dynamism of management and&#13;
receptivity to reforms; and within a reasonable distance from Moscow to simplify management of&#13;
implementation.&#13;
(a) Organizational and Procedural Reforms.&#13;
6.6    Chart 6.1 shows the new organizational structure that would be introduced at local (rayon)&#13;
offices.&#13;

to the public about tax responsibilities and processes. Means of dissemination would&#13;
include periodic seminars, development of tax guides and provision of information&#13;
pamphlets. The Unit would also perform such services as registering taxpayers,&#13;
assigning identification numbers, and answering questions and addressing complaints filed&#13;
by taxpayers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Russia: Tax Admini stration Modernization Project                                    Page 27&#13;
b.    The Data Processing Unit would enter information into the computer database from tax&#13;
returns and payments. The Unit would consist mainly of clerical workers.&#13;
c.     The Audit Unit would be responsible for field audits to determine whether and to what&#13;
extent taxpayers have fulfilled tax obligations. Audit selection would be computerized to&#13;
identify taxpayers most likely to be under-reporting taxes.&#13;
d.    The Default Collection Unit would work with delinquent taxpayers to secure necessary&#13;
returns and collect taxes due.&#13;
e.     The Appeals Advisory Service would review formal appeals filed by taxpayers and issue&#13;
the first level of decision on the appeal. The regional office and the central headquarters&#13;
of the STS would offer the next two levels of administrative appeal, and would interact&#13;
with the judicial system when necessary.&#13;
6.7    The project would introduce taxpayer self-assessment as the main procedural change. Such a&#13;
procedure copes with the growing number of taxpayers and the volume of tax returns and payments.&#13;
Under the self-assessment system taxpayers determine their tax liabilities without the intervention of tax&#13;
officers. The tax administration accepts the taxpayer's return subject to verification. Taxpayers need not&#13;
visit the local tax office to submit returns.&#13;
6.8    To support the successful introduction of this new functional arrangement, the project would&#13;
finance specialized expertise to complement the PMU's implementation teams. These experts would work&#13;
under a twinning arrangement with experienced STS staff to ensure that the proposed reforms are backed&#13;
up by practical procedures, guidelines, handbooks, and other materials so that they could be implemented&#13;
in a predictable, monitorable, and reasonably uniform manner. The following are key areas targeted for&#13;
expert advise:&#13;
a.     Taxpayer education. Taxpayers have to be educated to understand clearly their tax&#13;
responsibilities. Accordingly, the proposed project would finance (i) one staff year of&#13;
external specialist assistance to help develop an information and education campaign to&#13;
improve taxpayer awareness, and (ii) the costs of seminars, and the development and&#13;
dissemination of pamphlets and guides.&#13;
b.    Forms simplification. In keeping with self-assessment, the STS must produce user-&#13;
friendly tax reporting forms. This means simplifying tax forms and ensuring that, in&#13;
general, tax forms and procedures follow a high level of uniformity and consistency. In&#13;
addition, the STS will need to redesign tax forms for other taxes likely to be involved in&#13;
subsequent phases of the overall program, e.g. excise and income taxes. The proposed&#13;
project would finance six months of external expertise for this purpose.&#13;
c.    Auditing techniques. The concept of auditing would radically change from the previous&#13;
pattern of reviewing all tax statements on submission to one which focuses on&#13;
computerized selection of candidates with the greatest potential for underpayment&#13;
complemented by more intensive field audits. The proposed project includes one staff&#13;
year of external expertise to help the STS develop a guideline (procedural handbook) for&#13;
how to conduct audits. This guideline would permit a uniform procedure for auditing&#13;
taxpayers.&#13;
d.    Default collection techniques. Likewise, the general concept of enforcement would&#13;
change radically from current practices. The proposed project would include one staff&#13;
year of external expertise to assist the STS in ensuring that the legal framework for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technica Annex&#13;
Page 28                                              Russia: Tax Administration Modernization Project&#13;
enforcement is sound, and, together with STS staff, develop guidelines for default&#13;
collection, and an enforcement handbook covering the techniques to be used in the&#13;
different stages of the collection process. The procedures would also establish clear&#13;
guidelines on when to refer collection cases to the Tax Police.&#13;
(b) The automation system (US$15.4 million of base costs).&#13;
6.9    The proposed project would finance hardware, software and related facilities to automate tax&#13;
processes in three major respects, i.e. computerized (i) assessment of tax returns and payments, (ii)&#13;
enforcenent of tax relations, and (iii) generation of critical management information. The component&#13;
was designed and appraised to provide automation equipment to satisfy the short- to medium-term needs&#13;
of the STS, although the adopted architecture can expand modularly and with ease. If no action is taken,&#13;
the growth in the number of tax returns resulting from the expansion of the country's market-based&#13;
economy would create an increasingly burdensome processing workload. The system could be further&#13;
adjusted to reduce wasteful workload caused by high thresholds and the excessive collection of taxpayer&#13;
information. Optimum thresholds and collection forms are important to maintain the cost effectiveness&#13;
of the tax administration system.&#13;
6.10   The new tax administration model being piloted by the STS continues to support decentralized&#13;
operations with all tax processing being done at the local offices. The local tax offices would retain all&#13;
taxpayer details for their jurisdiction and also manage decentralized collections and refunds through&#13;
commercial banks. Local tax offices would also be responsible for taxpayer registration, responding to&#13;
customer service inquiries, for printing of local taxpayer statements and notices, and carrying out&#13;
improved auditing activities. These offices would interact with the regional office for data interchanges,&#13;
primarily for statistical and control data for management information. The head office would undertake&#13;
a variety of other activities such as maintaining systemic standards for tax administration policies and&#13;
procedures, providing master copies of taxpayer education and information dissemination materials,&#13;
performing statistical analyses on country-wide data, budgeting and planning, supporting an MIS and&#13;
database, and providing appropriate data to the Ministry of Finance and the legislature.&#13;
6.11   Automatedfunctions. The tax administration automation system would introduce new functions&#13;
to local tax offices. The key procedural change being introduced with the new system is that tax&#13;
inspectors will be assigned to specific tax administration functions, rather than being assigned to specific&#13;
sets of taxpayers. In support of this change, the new automation system has been designed to provide&#13;
the following functions:&#13;
a.     Registration of taxpayers. The system would register all taxpayers liable to pay taxes.&#13;
The system would assign a taxpayer identification number (TIN) to each taxpayer and&#13;
would create a register entry in a database of taxpayers. This system would also support&#13;
the modification of registration information, including de-registration and transfer of&#13;
taxpayers. It also generates various management information reports on taxpayer&#13;
registration.&#13;
b.     Data entry. The system would capture taxpayer data from tax returns, payments, and&#13;
miscellaneous tax documents and convert them  into electronic medium.  Source&#13;
documents are received either from the banks or directly from the taxpayers. Basic&#13;
reasonableness checks would be applied at point-of data entry, including proper controls&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Axnex&#13;
Russia: Tax Administration Modernization Project                                      Page 29&#13;
to ensure taxpayer data is neither repeated nor lost. The data entry system is also&#13;
responsible for balancing bank statements with payments received at the local office to&#13;
ensure the exactness of funds transferred by banks to government accounts.&#13;
c.     Return processing. The system processes returns sent by taxpayers. Initially the system&#13;
was set up to process only VAT returns, but the STS will add all other major federal&#13;
legal entities taxes to the system before it is deployed to the project regions. The system&#13;
performs mathematical verification of taxpayer-submitted data, ensures that indicated&#13;
payments were actually received, calculates appropriate penalties and interest, and finally&#13;
generates a notice to be sent to taxpayers in cases where there is a balance either in favor&#13;
or against the taxpayer.&#13;
d.     Stopfiler and late payment detection. The system automatically detects taxpayers who&#13;
have failed to submit tax returns or make payments as stated by the legislation. As soon&#13;
as violations are detected taxpayers are sent reminder notices. These notices are followed&#13;
up by the issuance of warning letters a few weeks later, if required. Finally, if a&#13;
taxpayer remains in delinquent status, the case would be referred to the delinquent&#13;
taxpayer section for personal follow-up by a tax inspector.&#13;
e.     Computerized audit selection. The system would have the capability to select taxpayers&#13;
to be audited according to pre-defined criteria.&#13;
f.    Management information statistics. The system would provide STS management at&#13;
central, regional, and local levels with statistics on revenue collection, return processing,&#13;
delinquent taxpayers, and auditing. To reduce costs and complexity of the project and&#13;
because of the uneven level of telecommunications facilities in the country, the project&#13;
will not include the design and implementation of a national telecommunications network.&#13;
Telecommunications may be used between the regional and central levels, and between&#13;
some large rayons and their regional office.&#13;
g.     Online enquiry system. The system would provide tax officials (taxpayer services clerks,&#13;
auditors, collectors, appeals advisors, etc.) with online access to all data submitted by the&#13;
taxpayer and all data generated by the tax administration for communication with a&#13;
taxpayer. Access to this information would be tightly secured, including audit trails&#13;
indicating who accessed the data, when, and what data was accessed.&#13;
6.12   The new tax automation system  would operate on a microcomputer-based, open systems&#13;
environment. For most regional and local tax offices this environment would consist of a local area&#13;
network, rnicrocomputers, a pc-based graphical user interface operating system, a pc-based relational&#13;
database management system, and ancillary hardware and software tools. Large local offices will require&#13;
a super-micro type of server, with a server based client-server database environment, to support the&#13;
anticipated workload. Each local tax office would operate in a decentralized mode, administering its own&#13;
database independently. Local tax office technology staff would be trained and supported to provide&#13;
professional information technology support to the office, including management of operating procedures&#13;
for backup, disaster recovery, and security management. Because hardware and software technology are&#13;
developing very fast and a number of significant technology developments are expected for the near&#13;
future, the infornation technology environmnent will have to be critically reexamined just before&#13;
procurement actions are initiated.&#13;
6.13   Hardware architecture. The proposed hardware architecture, to be financed under the project&#13;
consists of commodity-type, vendor independent, computer, and ancillary equipment including: LAN&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

servers operating on either large micro or super-micro computers using standard LAN or UNIX type of&#13;
operating systems, microcomputers, and peripheral equipment. Equipment to be purchased as part of the&#13;
project will be for installation either at local or regional tax offices. Intemal communications will be&#13;
based on standard Ethernet connections. It is anticipated that offices will use both laser and impact&#13;
printing technology to serve identified requirements. Each office will be equipped with a standard&#13;
communications modem to make it possible for offices to transfer electronic files over ordinary telephone&#13;
lines where and when this capability becomes available.&#13;
6.14   Table 6.2 below provides an indication of the intended investment in information technology to&#13;
be financed by the project. Further detail on the description, quantities, and estimated unit costs of the&#13;
various hardware, software, and ancillary devices is available in Attachment 2.&#13;

6.15   Large-size local offices. Large-size local offices would receive a LAN served by a dual super-&#13;
microcomputer server, probably operating under the UNIX operating system. Ethernet would be used&#13;
for communications between the server and about 20 workstations and eight printers, two of which would&#13;
be laser printers. A strong relational database system running on the server would support a client-server&#13;
environment. Workstations would be Windows based, on standard 486-DX microcomputers. External&#13;
communications, where and when available, would be through a standard 14.4 kbaud modem, or better.&#13;
6.16   Small-size local offices. Small-size local offices would receive a LAN served by a single large&#13;
486-DX or pentium type of microcomputer server, probably operating under the Novell network&#13;
operating system (NOS). Ethemet would be used for communications between the server and about&#13;
twelve workstations and five printers, one of which would be a laser printer. A PC-based relationa'&#13;
database system would provide database support on a workstation-by-workstation environment.&#13;
Workstations would be Windows based, on standard 486-DX microcomputers. External communications,&#13;
where and when available, would be through a standard 14.4 kbaud modem, or better.&#13;

6.17   Regional offices.  Large-size regional offices would receive an information technology&#13;
environment similar to the environment described above for small-size local offices, but with only eight&#13;
workstations and two printers, one of which would be a laser printer. In addition, these offices would&#13;
receive a suite of microcomputer-based software to facilitate data analysis and reporting both in text and&#13;
graphical formats.&#13;
6.18   Existing equipment. As indicated above, in 1992 the STS embarked on a computerization&#13;
program and a large number of tax offices are now equipped with microcomputers. The number of&#13;
workstations planned for deployment by the project corresponds to the minimum number of workstations&#13;
necessary to provide the intended level of functionality. In all cases, in anticipation of growth needs, the&#13;
LAN capacity has been designed to accommodate a larger number of workstations. Some of the existing&#13;
workstations could be added to the LAN and continue to be used for tax processing, while others could&#13;
be redirected to support administrative functions which are not covered as part of the project but are also&#13;
needed to perform ad-hoc statistical analysis, and office support functions. Final decisions will be made&#13;
on a case-by-case basis by the time of procurement of computers and installation services.&#13;
6.19 Applications system design and development. The project would continue to support the in-house&#13;
development of the new tax automation system, to include new functionality and support for additional&#13;
taxes. Responsibility for application design and development activities would be assigned to about ten&#13;
existing in-house information technology experts, who are complemented by tax administration design&#13;
specialists funded by the IMF. These are the same technical staff who created the new tax automation&#13;
system currently undergoing a pilot implementation. It is expected that this small design and development&#13;
team will be seconded temporarily to the Project Management Unit, and will remain there until all project&#13;
activities are completed and all intended application functionality is placed in production.&#13;
6.20   The development team would return to its normal assignment within the STS organization after&#13;
developmental activities are completed, the system documented, and placed in production status. It is&#13;
envisaged that the team will be charged with routine application maintenance and enhancement after&#13;
completion of the development cycle. An Electronic Data Processing (EDP) expert would assist the&#13;
development team in reviewing the possibility of incorporating the remaining taxes into the current&#13;
system, in creating guidelines for development and maintenance, and in improving the performance and&#13;
effectiveness of the automation system.&#13;
6.21   Development activities are centralized in Moscow. Hardware and software to support these&#13;
activities were obtained through a grant from the European Community. The basic applications&#13;
development environment is microcomputer based and include a fourth generation language and a pc-&#13;
based database. Application development activities will be financed by the STS, with the exception of&#13;
about US$0.5 million in foreign expenditures for expert training to be provided as part of the loan.&#13;
6.22   Financing. The proposed project would finance foreign expert services; equipment, including&#13;
hardware, software, networks, and ancillary devices; technical assistance for implementation and training&#13;
of technical staff on the use of modern information technology and application development&#13;
methodologies; technology training for system developers; and minor upgrade of tax office facilities&#13;
including necessary electrical, communications, security, and environmental control required for proper&#13;
operation of computer equipment. About 30 months of foreign expert services would be financed to&#13;
further develop the areas of forms design, auditing techniques, taxpayer education. Moreover, two full&#13;

time advisors, financed by the IMF, would provide about 48 months of assistance to the STS in the&#13;
implementation of the automation systems component. The PMU would coordinate and provide quality&#13;
control over the goods and services delivered by the supplier or suppliers of information technology&#13;
equipment.&#13;
(c) Staff Training (US$3.8 milion of base costs).&#13;
6.23   Overall strategy and approach. The project would finance training of tax officials. Training&#13;
would be provided in various forms, including on-the-job training, coaching and role-modeling, formal&#13;
training as well as study tours in Russia and abroad. The distinctive characteristics of the approach to&#13;
training would lie in its practical, job-oriented approach. Most of the training would be imparted through&#13;
carefully detailed work procedures and carefully designed instructional manuals, coupled with coaching&#13;
and supervision by supervisors, managers, consultants and trainers. Most of the fornal training would&#13;
be carried out by managers, tax inspectors and other officers from the State Tax Service, including the&#13;
trainers allocated to the project. Some training would be acquired in the existing training institutions,&#13;
through the regular training procedures already in place at the STS. The typical training involved in the&#13;
project would consist of two stages. In the first stage, and immediately after the reform starts in a given&#13;
tax office, managers and the official in charge of information technology from each office would be&#13;
brought together to a training site located in a "demonstration office". A demonstration office would be&#13;
an office which has already implemented the changes, and where trainees would be able to observe the&#13;
changes and learn the skills associated with them. The second stage would consist of training the various&#13;
categories of staff. This training would be delivered immediately before, during or immediately after the&#13;
implementation of the reform in any given local office. This training would take various forms including&#13;
on-the-job and formal training sessions. While on-the-job training would necessarily be performed&#13;
locally, formal training could be delivered either locally or at a training site in which trainees from&#13;
different offices could participate. The decision about where to locate training would depend on the&#13;
number of trainees and the distances involved.&#13;
6.24   Training needs analysis. A substantial number of STS staff in the designated project regions,&#13;
existing or new, would need to receive training in a number of areas and procedures, which are new to&#13;
both the tax system and the individuals. Specifically:&#13;
a.     Staff assigned to the Taxpayer Education Services Unit would need to develop a broad&#13;
knowledge and skills basis which include computer related skills, information handling&#13;
skills, communication, public relations skills and -training techniques in addition to&#13;
relatively high levels of knowledge of tax-specific legislation, regulations and procedures.&#13;
b.     Staff assigned to the Data Processing Unit would need to develop keying skills, ability&#13;
to handle specific software, filing, checking and information processing skills of various&#13;
sorts. Some staff would also need basic accounting knowledge to allow them to verify&#13;
bank statements.&#13;
c.     Staff assigned to Audit Planning would require high levels of competence on accounting&#13;
and auditing, as well as specific skills to define audit plans and to analyze and evaluate&#13;
data on tax collection through the use of computers.&#13;
d.     Audit inspectors would need advanced skills on the use, manipulation and analysis of&#13;
electronic data, a high-level command of audit techniques, professional level of&#13;
accounting, total command of the legislation and procedures, professional written and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Rusia: Tax Admbiibtion Modemization Project                                             Page 33&#13;
inter-personal communication skills, including investigative skills. In some cases they&#13;
will also need to develop tax-specific expertise.&#13;
e.     Staff assigned to the Contact Collection Unit of the Default Collection Section would&#13;
need to develop techniques for securing tax returns and taxes in default. Skills include&#13;
the ability to interpret balance sheets, to estimate capacity of payment by delinquent&#13;
taxpayers, mastery of the legislation, strong negotiation skills and report writing. Staff&#13;
allocated to the Enforcement Collection Unit would need to have an operational&#13;
knowledge of the legislation pertinent to their work, as well as strong investigating and&#13;
interpersonal skills.&#13;
f.     In addition to their regular professional skills, managers and trainers would need a&#13;
thorough knowledge of the new institutional model and systems, a detailed knowledge of&#13;
the areas which they manage or teach, as well as strong coaching and training skills.&#13;
The objectives of training would vary according to the functions of each individual, but virtually the&#13;
entire staff in the two designated regions would receive some form of training.&#13;
6.25   All participants would be involved in formal training sessions in which they would be exposed&#13;
to an overview of the reform and changes it entails, as well as the specific implications for the activities&#13;
of each unit and function. Table 6.3 summarizes the training needs analysis of the various target groups&#13;
within the project. Attachment 3 presents the detailed needs analysis and staff training plan.&#13;

6.26  Formal training program. Formal training programs include on-the-job, formal training sessions&#13;
and study trips in Russia and abroad. All 3,500 staff members involved in the process of modernization&#13;
would participate in general training sessions about the changes and in one or more specific training&#13;
sessions concerning their own functions. The number of training activities in which each individual&#13;
participant would be involved is illustrated in Table 6.4. The actual number of training sessions cannot&#13;
be estimated accurately beforehand, for two major reasons. First, most of the training would be delivered&#13;
through on-the-job training, by means of training manuals and tutorials. Second, the actual size of each&#13;
training group would depend on the implementation strategy to be followed in each region (by agency,&#13;
groups of agencies or sub-region).&#13;

6.27  Financing. The proposed project would finance development of training materials and delivery&#13;
of training programs, as well as the expert services necessary. A full-time training expert to be allocated&#13;
to the project during its first 18 months would be primarily responsible to train the group of 10 full-time&#13;
trainers allocated to the project. Subject-matter experts hired to develop other project components would&#13;
also be expected to work about one third of their time developing procedures and manuals which would&#13;
serve as direct inputs for the training activities. These experts would be also involved in the direct&#13;
training of the staff of the first offices to be modernized.&#13;
2. Institution Development (US$5.2 million of base costs)&#13;
6.28  Institution development of tax administration would be achieved through three mnain components&#13;
-organizational development, preparation for national implementation, and project management unit&#13;
support.&#13;
(a) Organizational Development (US$2.6 million of base costs)&#13;
6.29   Tax administration strategy. Ordinarily, comprehensive administrative reform programns are&#13;
based on an agreed strategic plan which defines the business of the agency, the functions required of its&#13;
organizational structures and the policies and procedures that will be adopted to manage its operational&#13;
processes. Tax administration reforms are well designed for the local tax offices, but a strategic plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

does not yet exist for the STS as a whole. Before nationwide implementation of tax administration&#13;
reforms, a strategy must be developed to guide the process. The strategy should take into account, inter&#13;
alia, experiences in implementing the first two phases of the overall program. Consequently, the&#13;
proposed project would finance an integrated set of studies leading to a national tax administration&#13;
strategy. The project would finance expert services and fellowships abroad for STS staff for this purpose.&#13;
6.30   Organizational development at STS headquarters. The proposed project would introduce&#13;
functional organizations at the local level, but the federal level remains organized according to types of&#13;
taxes or geographical regions. Consequently, there is a parallel need to reassess the general strcture of&#13;
the STS at the center and regions to determine (i) how they can best provide effective managerial&#13;
direction and operational support to the new structures, functions and automation systems being&#13;
introduced at the lower levels with the system; and (ii) how best to support existing functions that have&#13;
been substantially altered, such as the management of appeals. The proposed study would recommend&#13;
new institutional arrangements in terms of functions, organizations and staffing and resource implications.&#13;
It would also review internal management procedures in key areas such as personnel policies and&#13;
corruption management, so as to ensure long-term sustainability of the project.&#13;
6.31  Interagency cooperaton. A second phase of the study on organizational development would help&#13;
devise a strategy and propose a protocol for cooperation among key agencies involved in taxation and&#13;
enforcement, e.g. customs and pension/social insurance agencies, so as to foster commnon approaches to&#13;
deal with taxpayers. The Taxpayer Identification Number and its general use is a specific issue to be&#13;
addressed.&#13;
6.32   Taxpayer educaton strategy. A strategy for taxpayer information would be developed with the&#13;
assistance of external experts, including an information and education campaign to advise taxpayers of&#13;
their responsibilities and procedures for compliance.&#13;
6.33   Natonal audit plan. The STS intends to develop a national audit plan which would specify the&#13;
proportion of taxpayers by category that should be audited, conditions that would trigger audits and&#13;
identify the mix of audit methods to be employed. The Plan would also define the resources required,&#13;
staff training implications and methods to evaluate effectiveness. Four staff months of external technical&#13;
assistance have been budgeted for this purpose.&#13;
6.34 National training plan. The proposed project would finance work by the STS to prepare a&#13;
national staff training plan. This would include a detailed needs analysis in relation to the performance&#13;
requirements of new functions, identification of target groups, training content, required training&#13;
approaches and materials, effective modern delivery methods and outcomes expected.&#13;
6.35   Legal and regulatory framework review.  Problems in the existing legal and regulatory&#13;
framework significantly hamper tax administration in the Russian Federation. A coherent, transparent,&#13;
equitable, and enforceable framework is necessary to reform and improve tax administration in Russia.&#13;
The Ministry of Finance and the Duma have initiated reviews of the legal framework of taxation with&#13;
foreign assistance from a number of donors including the IMF, and the U.S. and German governments.&#13;
Complementary to the above activities would be an internal STS review focussing primarily on the&#13;
regulatory framework including instructions, clarifications, methodologies, and procedures enacted by&#13;
the STS. Therefore, this subcomponent of the project would finance expert services to undertake an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Techxicl Annex&#13;
Russia: Tax Administration Modemization Project                                    Page 37&#13;
analysis of the legal and regulatory framework of the Russian taxation system from the STS viewpoint,&#13;
and establish coordination with parallel activities taking place at the MOF and Duma.&#13;
6.36  In view of the overall goals and nature of the project, the analysis would first and foremost&#13;
concentrate on the implementation and enforcement of current tax laws through the existing regulatory&#13;
framework enacted by the STS. Particular attention would be paid to the following areas: (i) consistency&#13;
between tax laws and internal STS regulations; (ii) comprehensiveness, coherency, and transparency of&#13;
laws and regulations, including taxpayer accessibility to laws and regulations; (iii) enforcement of laws&#13;
and regulations; (iv) imposition and appropriateness of penalties; (v) discretionary powers of the STS;&#13;
(vi) procedures and basis for exemptions; (vii) administrative and judicial dispute resolution between the&#13;
STS and taxpayers, including the need of specialized courts; (viii) interagency coordination and exchange&#13;
of information; and (ix) central/regional tax relationship, including collection, expenditure and&#13;
enforcement responsibilities.&#13;
6.37   The above analysis would take into account and be interrelated to the other activities financed&#13;
under the Organizational Development subcomponent of the project. Specifically, the analysis would be&#13;
integrated with the work on the national tax administration strategy (para. 6.29), institutional organization&#13;
of the STS (para. 6.30), interagency cooperation (para. 6.31), and national audit plan (para. 6.33).&#13;
6.38   The analysis would culminate in a comprehensive report outlining the problems and proposed&#13;
solutions in the regulatory area of tax administration, and indicating areas of the legal framework which&#13;
might require attention by the MOF and Duma. The analysis would be undertaken by foreign and local&#13;
consultants experienced with legal issues of tax administration both within and outside of the Russian&#13;
Federation.&#13;
6.39   Financing. The proposed project would finance fellowships, and foreign and local expert&#13;
services. About 50 months of fellowships would be financed to expose local and regional tax&#13;
administration managers to modem tax administration organizations in Western countries, and for&#13;
attendance to tax administration seminars on modern policies, procedures, and practices for tax&#13;
administration. About 38 months of foreign expert services, and 80 months of local expert services&#13;
would be financed to develop concept papers on STS modernization and inter-agency cooperation,&#13;
national plans for auditing and education, and legal and regulatory framework review. The PMU would&#13;
coordinate these organizational development activities and engage STS management in reviewing proposed&#13;
organizational changes.&#13;
(b) Preparation for National Implementation (US$1.0 milion of base costs)&#13;
6.40   National standards and guidelines. This would include development of operational standards&#13;
for the STS covering procedures, hardware and physical facilities to support automation activities (e.g.&#13;
power supply, wiring and security for equipment). These would be prepared in the form of guidelines&#13;
on tax administration modernization, the first version of which would embody the standards used for the&#13;
Phase 2 project and subsequent versions of which would incorporate modifications based on&#13;
implementation experience and technological developments.&#13;
6.41   Phase 2 evaluation study. Technical assistance would be provided to help the STS evaluate&#13;
results of the implementation in the project regions and codify lessons for future modifications in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Techxical Ann&#13;
Page 38                                            Russia: Tax Admistration Modernization Project&#13;
program. The comprehensive evaluation would cover all key aspects of the project and would make&#13;
suggestions of how to improve the processes used in the projects for national implementation.&#13;
6.42   National automaton strategy. As a result of the review of the strategy to automate the two&#13;
regions and technological developments, the project would finance a study to define alternatives for&#13;
organizing the STS information technology functions, and national strategies for methodology for&#13;
applications development, hardware/software, communications, data collection, data security and data&#13;
processing. The study would produce standards for the central, regional and local levels and define&#13;
information flows among these levels. An important part of this strategy would be a national contingency&#13;
plan providing guidelines necessary to ensure business continuity and survival of electronic records under&#13;
extreme situations.&#13;
6.43   Feasibility study on individual taxes. A study would be made to determine whether individual&#13;
taxation should be included in the scope of the third phase of the project. The study would assess the&#13;
requirements, costs and issues in phasing in such taxation as part of the modernization program.&#13;
6.44  Implementation plan. Finally, the project would finance detailed preparation for the third phase&#13;
(1997-98) of the program, incorporating the findings of the above studies, which would be consolidated&#13;
in an integrated implementation manual.&#13;
6.45   Financing. The proposed project would finance fellowships, and foreign and local expert&#13;
services. About 7 months of fellowships would be financed to provide designers with a solid&#13;
understanding of the role of tax administration in market economies. About 28 months of foreign expert&#13;
services, and 56 months of local expert services would be financed to develop standards for automation&#13;
and office facilities; a business continuity and contingency plan; a feasibility study on inclusion of taxation&#13;
of individuals in the current automation system; and a thorough independent technical evaluation of phase&#13;
2 implementation so as to take full advantage of lessons learned in the planning for national&#13;
implementation. The PMU would coordinate these activities and engage project and STS management&#13;
in reviewing the proposals for national deployment of the tax administration modernization organization&#13;
and systems.&#13;
(c) Project Management Unit Support (US$1.6 mnion of base costs)&#13;
6.46   The new organizational structure for local tax offices, to be implemented in parallel with the&#13;
automation of these offices, has been planned to take place from the ground up with little infrastructure&#13;
support at higher levels of the organization. Higher levels need strengthening to undertake a project of&#13;
this dimension. A Project Management Unit (PMU) would be established at the central level of the STS&#13;
to provide this support. (See Chapter 7 for detailed explanation.) The establishment of this Unit would&#13;
be required to support future phases of program implementation, and some of its functions (such as the&#13;
procurement, taxpayer education, EDP development, and evaluation teams) would become permanent&#13;
features of the STS.&#13;
6.47   Financing. The proposed project would finance foreign and local expert services. About 13&#13;
months of foreign expert services, and 72 months of local expert services would be financed to support&#13;
project management activities, particularly procurement, accounting and disbursement, and translation&#13;
and interpretation services.&#13;

3. Technical Assistance Sunmary&#13;
6.48   The proposed project would finance a total of about 181 person-months of external expert&#13;
services, 216 person-months of local expert services, and 252 person-weeks of fellowships and study&#13;
tours abroad. Bank-financed technical assistance would focus primarily on the development of tax&#13;
administration management to prepare the STS for its national improvement program, and overseas&#13;
training activities for selected STS management and technical operations staff. IMF-financed technical&#13;
assistance would concentrate on substantive tax policy and administration activities. A formal agreement&#13;
between the IMF and the Russian Federation on the provision of this assistance has been concluded.&#13;

6.49   The PMU would receive assistance from a number of foreign experts with the objective of both&#13;
developing concept papers and proposals in their fields of expertise and transferring knowledge to STS&#13;
counterpart staff who would later institutionalize these functions and provide long-term project&#13;
sustainability. The following is a summary of the expertise that would be provided under the Tax&#13;
Administration Modernization Project.&#13;
6.50   Chief Technical Advisor (CTA). The CTA would work in close cooperation with the project&#13;
manager to assist in day-to-day activities of the project. The CTA would facilitate and coordinate the&#13;
foreign assistance. This assignment is expected to last for approximately 30 months. The financing of&#13;
the first 12 months has been confirmed by the IMF, which is expected to continue financing the expert&#13;
through the entire implementation period.&#13;
6.51   Electronic Data Processing (EDP) Software Specialist. The EDP expert would be responsible&#13;
for assisting the STS in modifying the recently developed tax computerization system to include support&#13;
processing of profits and other tax returns and payments, and for monitoring and tuning the performance&#13;
of the overall computerization system. The EDP software specialist would also assist the STS in moving&#13;
towards a client/server database platform for local offices requiring larger data processing capacity. On-&#13;
the-job training of STS staff would be integral part of the job to ensure continuity and sustainability. This&#13;
assignment is expected to last for approximately 18 months, and would also be financed directly by the&#13;
IMF.&#13;
6.52   Forms Design Erpert. The forms design expert would be responsible for the review and redesign&#13;
of all tax and other internal STS forms with a -view to simplifying forms and to improving consistency&#13;
and ease-of-use. This would include the profit tax form and a review of the recently developed VAT&#13;
forms, besides routine modifications because of legislative changes, forms for other taxes and internal&#13;
procedures. Transfer of practical know-how in this area would be important for project sustainability.&#13;
It is estimated that this assignment would last about six months.&#13;
6.53   Auditing Techniques Expert. The improved tax administration modernization system would&#13;
permit the STS to conduct better selected field audits. To carry out this function effectively, the STS&#13;
would need to develop guidelines (a procedural handbook) for how to conduct field audits, and to train&#13;
its inspectors in auditing techniques. The procedural handbook would create the conditions necessary for&#13;
uniform auditing of taxpayers. The auditing techniques expert would lead the effort to develop the&#13;
handbook and provide initial training to STS trainers and inspectors on how to conduct successful field&#13;
audits. It is estimated that this assignment would last for about 12 months.&#13;
6.54   Default Collection Technique Expert.  Like in the case of auditing, the improved tax&#13;
administration system, and the new division of labor being implemented in the local offices would permit&#13;
the STS to improve the effectiveness of its collection activities. To carry out this function effectively the&#13;
STS would need to develop standard guidelines, reflected on a procedural handbook, for how to conduct&#13;
the different stages of enforcement-from friendly arrangements in the early stages to referral to the Tax&#13;
Police in extreme criminal cases. Formal guidelines would increase predictability, monitorability, and&#13;
uniformity of enforcement activities. The default collection techniques expert would lead the effort to&#13;
develop these guidelines, train a number of tax inspectors in how to conduct successful enforcement at&#13;
its different stages, and assist the STS in ensuring that the legal framework is consistent with the&#13;
&#13;

enforcement requirements of the agency. It is estimated that this assignment would last for about 12&#13;
months.&#13;
6.55   Taxpayer Education Expert.  The STS would need to develop a taxpayer infornation and&#13;
education campaign to enable the implementation of self-assessment procedures, and improve the&#13;
relationship between the STS and taxpayers. This expert would assist the STS in institutionalizing the&#13;
development and maintenance of publications and other materials used for information dissemination and&#13;
in improving the services and education programs introduced during the pilot phase of the project. The&#13;
expert, while leading the effort, should provide on-the-job training to counterpart STS staff assigned to&#13;
this task. It is estimated that this assignment would last for about 12 months.&#13;
6.56   7haining Expert. The training expert would be primarily responsible for training and coaching&#13;
the STS trainers allocated to the project. Initially, the training expert would design a training plan for&#13;
the implementation activities envisaged under the project, and work with the trainers to ensure the quality&#13;
of training delivery. Subsequently and considering the initial experience, the training expert would lead&#13;
the effort to develop the National Training Plan described above. The activities of the training expert&#13;
would be those of a separate project with the International Tax Training Institute. It is estimated that this&#13;
assignment would last for about 18 months.&#13;
6.57   Procurement Adviser. The procurement adviser would assist the STS in acquiring the required&#13;
technical assistance, hardware, software, and services for project execution. This would include assisting&#13;
in finalizing the tender specification, interacting with the World Bank and potential suppliers, evaluating&#13;
bids, selecting appropriate supplier, and addressing contract execution issues. The procurement adviser&#13;
would be expected to have expertise in procurement activities under World Bank and/or other&#13;
international organizations procurement procedures. The procurement adviser would work in tandem with&#13;
and train STS procurement staff so that they would be able to carry out these duties upon completion of&#13;
the assignment. It is estimated that this assignment would last for about 12 months.&#13;
6.58   Accounting and Disbursement Adviser. The accounting and disbursement adviser would advise&#13;
the STS accounting and disbursement team in how to setup their accounting, disbursement and project&#13;
control procedures so as to ensure prudent financial management of the project. The accounting and&#13;
disbursement adviser would be expected to have expertise in financial management requirements for&#13;
World Bank loans. It is estimated that this assignment would last for about one month.&#13;
6.59   Translation and Interpretation Staff. This staff would provide translation and interpretation&#13;
services to the project in general and support the activities of the foreign experts, and international&#13;
agencies providing assistance to the STS. It is estimated that 72 staff months of translation staff would&#13;
be required to support the activities under the project over a period of about three years.&#13;

CHAFrER 7. CosIs, FINANCING AND ImPLM NTATION&#13;
A.    Project Costs&#13;
7.1    The total project cost is estimated at about US$27.4 million equivalent (287.7 billion Rubles),&#13;
including price contingencies of US$0.8 million and physical contingencies of US$2.2 million which&#13;
represent 3.0% and 9.0% respectively, of the base cost of US$24.4 million. The project costs include&#13;
the provision of technical assistance (both foreign and local), overseas fellowships and in-country training,&#13;
equipment, training materials and software, minor refurbishing and furnishing of facilities, and&#13;
incremental operating costs incurred during the implementation period. The estimated costs by project&#13;
component and by category of expenditure are shown in Tables 7.1 and 7.2, respectively, and further&#13;
detailed in Attachments 4 and 5.&#13;
7.2    Project costs were estimated as follows:&#13;
a.     Base costs. All project costs are based on January 1995 prices and conversions from the&#13;
local currency at the market rate of 3861 Rubles per US dollar prevailing on January 17,&#13;
1995.  Technical assistance (TA) costs are derived from  recent fees quoted for&#13;
comparative specialized services in Bank-financed projects in Russia and are estimated&#13;
per person-month at US$20,000 for external specialist services, US$2,000-2,400 for local&#13;
specialist services, and US$5,000 per week for overseas fellowships. The person-month&#13;
costs of TA include fees, recruitment/relocation costs, housing and subsistence, and&#13;
overheads. Equipment unit costs are based on recent quotations from suppliers of&#13;
equipment and software.&#13;
b.     Contingency allowances. Price contingencies for domestic price increases are calculated&#13;
at projected Ruble inflation rates of 122% for 1994/95, 56% for 1995/96 and 20% for&#13;
1996/97, with corresponding Rbl/US$ exchange rates of 6174, 10704, and 12762 at&#13;
project year mid-points for the samne time period. '0 Price contingencies for international&#13;
price increases are calculated at 1.5% for 1994/95, 1.8% for 1995/96 and 2.6% for&#13;
1996/97." Physical contingencies are included in the project at an average rate of 9%.&#13;
c.     Foreign exchange component.  The foreign exchange component was estimated as&#13;
follows: (i) foreign expert services and fellowships - 100%; (ii) local expert services -&#13;
0%; (iii) equipment - 100% percent; and (iv) incremental recurrent costs - 2% of base&#13;
costs. The total foreign exchange component is estimated at US$17.7 million including&#13;
contingencies, or 65% of total project costs.&#13;
d.     Taxes and import duties. Project costs include US$3.5 million in taxes and duties which&#13;
are 13% of total project costs and are included at the rate of 33% applicable to the&#13;
importation of equipment purchased internationally.&#13;
e.    Incremental recurrent costs. Incremental recurrent costs are estimated in total at 2% of&#13;
baseline costs, US$0.5 million, and include primary utility use costs to support&#13;
processing automation and its operation, on an incremental basis.&#13;

B.    Project Finandng&#13;
7.3    The proposed Bank loan of US$16.8 million would finance 61 % of total project costs. The loan&#13;
would finance 95% of the foreign exchange costs of the project and no local costs (excluding taxes and&#13;
duties). The IMF would contribute US$0.9 million, 5% of foreign costs, or 3% of total project costs.&#13;
The STS would finance US$6.2 million of the project's local cost requirements, or 23 % of project costs.&#13;
The Government would commit the $3.5 million in taxes and duties. Table 7.3 outlines the distribution&#13;
of financial responsibility.&#13;
7.4    By committing itself to provide for about 23% of project costs, the STS, supported by the&#13;
Government, is mobilizing critically scarce resources in an effort to address the challenge it faces in an&#13;
effective and timely manner. During negotiations, the Government provided satisfactory evidence of the&#13;
ability of the STS to meet its commitment of counterpart funds. Most of the STS's contribution would&#13;
be used to (i) prepare and refurbish central, regional and local offices for installation operation of critical&#13;
automation equipment; (ii) train staff; and (iii) conduct taxpayer orientation seminars.&#13;

C.    Project Management and Implementation&#13;
7.5    The following organizational structure has been introduced by the STS to ensure control and&#13;
timely implementation of the Tax Administration Modernization Project. Chart 7.1 contains a diagram&#13;
of the organizational structure, including the Project Management Unit (PMU). The key principles for&#13;
the project structure are the following:&#13;
a.     Clear reporting procedures to ensure accountability;&#13;
b.    Clear division of functions and authorities between project teams to ensure quick&#13;
implementation;&#13;
c.    Organization of project teams based on functional responsibilities; and&#13;
d.    Piloting of possible models for future organizational changes in the STS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Technica Annex&#13;
Russia: Tax Administration Modernization Project                                        Page 47&#13;
7.6    The structure is complex. Parallel work of multiple groups would require serious efforts from&#13;
the STS to manage the effective collaboration between them. The Steering Committee is the key element&#13;
of this process on all policy matters and the project leader and his deputies are responsible for&#13;
coordination at the operational level. The Project Management Unit is closely integrated into the regular&#13;
STS work and has been staffed mostly by STS personnel allocated for this purpose. Several project&#13;
implementation groups are expected to form a basis for the future new permanent organizational&#13;
structures of the STS.&#13;
1. Project Policy and Supervision&#13;
7.7    The Steering Committee is the key element for the project policy development and supervision.&#13;
The Steering Committee is responsible for the following:&#13;
a.     Overall direction of the project;&#13;
b.     Close integration of the project activities into regular STS operations;&#13;
c.     Key policy decisions on project content;&#13;
d.     Approval of the operational guidelines and long-term plans/concept papers;&#13;
e.     Allocation of the STS staff to work under the project;&#13;
f.     Coordination with regional tax services and authorities; and&#13;
g.     Supervision of project implementation progress.&#13;
7.8    The Steering Committee is made up of 12-15 permanent members, including:&#13;
a.     The Head of the STS, who would be the Chairman of the Steering Comnittee'2;&#13;
b.     2-3 Deputy Heads of the STS responsible for crucial areas of the project;&#13;
C.     3-4 Heads of those department who would be most closely involved in the project&#13;
implementation;&#13;
d.     2-3 Heads of the Regional Tax offices participating in the project;&#13;
e.     2 Heads of the rayon offices participating in the project;&#13;
f.     Representative from the Ministry of Finance;&#13;
g.     Project Leader (Head of the Project Management Unit); and&#13;
h.     Chief Technical Advisor.&#13;
When discussing specific issues, the Steering Committee would invite appropriate STS managers&#13;
responsible for those areas. The Steering Committee would meet every quarter (possibly more often&#13;
initially). The structure and staffing of the Steering Committee was approved by an Ordinance or Prikaz&#13;
of the STS Head.&#13;
7.9    The Project Director manages the overall implementation of the project and is responsible for&#13;
ensuring close cooperation between the Steering Committee and the Project Management Unit. He is&#13;
advised by the Chief Technical Advisor on technical issues related to the project. He is the main point&#13;
of contact for the Bank and IMF. The Project Director is a Deputy Head of the STS.&#13;
12 The Head of the STS is the Chairman of the Steering Committee due to the importance of the project as the&#13;
preparation phase for national tax administration modernization.&#13;

7.10   Project management. The STS has formally established the Project Management Unit (PMU)&#13;
by an Ordinance ("Prikaz") of the STS Head. It consists of:&#13;
a.     Project Leader (Head of the PMU);&#13;
b.     3 Deputy Project Leaders;&#13;
c.     Head of the Procurement Team;&#13;
d.     Head of the Disbursement Team; and&#13;
e.     2-3 Heads of the key implementation teams (to be determined by the Steering&#13;
Commnittee).&#13;
The PMU was initially organized on a limited basis (Director, Deputy Directors and one procurement&#13;
administrator) to facilitate project preparation and start initial activities. On February 3, 1995 the STS&#13;
appointed the Heads of the six main project implementation teams'3.&#13;
7.11   The Project Leader is responsible for the day-to-day management of the project and general&#13;
coordination of project activities. The Project Leader's primary responsibility is to ensure effective&#13;
coordination and cooperation between various implementation groups through effective control over his&#13;
or her deputies. He works in close contact with the Project Director on all project policy issues and is&#13;
the mnain contact point for the Bank and the IMF on all operational issues. He is assisted by the Chief&#13;
Technical Adviser.&#13;
7.12   Deputy Project Leaders are responsible for implementation of Institution Development Programs,&#13;
Automation Systems Development and Project Implementation at the sites. Their primary goal is to ensure&#13;
effective cooperation between various working groups and especially among those reporting to them. The&#13;
Heads of respective implementation teams report to them (Chart 7.1).&#13;
7.13   The Procurement Team consists of 2-3 STS staff (responsible for procurement of goods,&#13;
procurement of consultant's services and procurement of training services) assisted by international and&#13;
local procurement experts. It is expected that, besides organizing procurement of goods and services for&#13;
the project, this team would work closely on development of STS internal procurement regulations and&#13;
would possibly form a basis for the STS internal procurement department.&#13;
7.14   The Disbursement Team consists of two persons (a chief accountant and bookkeeper allocated&#13;
by the STS) to ensure proper accounting of project accounts and organize disbursement of loan proceeds.&#13;
The STS has appointed the disbursement team and approved the proper accounting rules and principles&#13;
for the project.&#13;
7.15 The Translation/lnterpretation Team consists of 5 interpreters and translators hired by the STS&#13;
to facilitate the work of foreign consultants and ensure availability to all key documents for STS staff.&#13;
13 The six main project implementation teams required at project start-up are: Procurement, Disbursement, Operational&#13;
Guidelines Development, Concept Papers Development, EDP Development, and Forms Design.&#13;

Project Implementation Teams&#13;
7.16   Project implementation would be done through special teams responsible for the implementation&#13;
of specific components or specific activities under respective components. In total there would be 9&#13;
groups and a special users working group. Some groups would be permanent and some temporary&#13;
depending on the nature of the group's activity. Each group would have the group leader appointed by&#13;
the STS. Most of the groups would consist of the STS staff allocated for this work under the project.&#13;
They would be assisted by international and Russian experts.&#13;
7.17  Instiution development.  One team would be responsible for development of Operational&#13;
Guidelines. Four STS staff members (on average) would be allocated for the work under each set of&#13;
guidelines (Auditing Techniques, EDP Development Guidelines, Procurement Guidelines, Office&#13;
Standards Guidelines). The work of this group would be temporary and would be considered finished as&#13;
soon as the respective guidelines would be approved by the STS. It is envisaged that as soon as the&#13;
guidelines are approved they would be; to the extent possible, used by the STS in its regular operations.&#13;
One person from the team would continuously work on implementation of subsequent Guidelines and&#13;
possible modifications.&#13;
7.18   Another team would manage the preparation of Strategies and Concept Papers. The STS would&#13;
allocate an average of 6 persons responsible for each of the concept papers (national tax modernization&#13;
concept, national automation strategy, strategy of STS cooperation with other agencies on tax related&#13;
issues, national contingency plan, national audit plan, national training plan). These managers would&#13;
organize the development by those concepts by respective department/divisions of the STS. International&#13;
and local experts would be used, as necessary, for specific issues.&#13;
7.19   Another team would be responsible for all activities under the publication/printing part of the&#13;
taxpayer education actvity of the project as well as for all other activities related to taxpayer information.&#13;
The STS would allocate 4-5 people for this team. The group would work continuously and it is expected&#13;
that it would form a basis for the STS internal organizational structure responsible for all taxpayer&#13;
education issues (printing, publications, public relations, training seminars for taxpayers, etc.).&#13;
7.20 Automation systems development. The EDP Development Team would be responsible for&#13;
modifying and maintaining the computer system that was developed during Phase 1 (pilot project). This&#13;
includes adding all other taxes, performing functional enhancements, developing computer logic to handle&#13;
processing of tax forms for Profit Tax and applying legislative and technical changes. The same people&#13;
responsible for software development during the pilot project would be involved. The STS would provide&#13;
1 EDP manager/designer, and 6 - 8 programmers. The team would be assisted by the international EDP&#13;
development expert and possibly by Russian experts.&#13;
7.21   The Forms Design Team would be responsible for designing simplified tax forms for the profit&#13;
tax and other taxes as well as for keeping forms compliant with the current legislation. The unit would&#13;
be assigned two STS staff and would be assisted by a foreign forms design expert. It would work on a&#13;
temporary basis.&#13;
7.22   Project implementation at the sites. Most activities of the groups mentioned below would be&#13;
implemented at the regional and local level (except for the training of trainers programs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

7.23   The Training Team would be responsible for the organization and implementation of training and&#13;
overseas fellowship programs under the project. It would consist of master trainers and training program&#13;
managers (8-10 people total). The group is expected to work continuously and coordinate its activities&#13;
with the training department of the STS.&#13;
7.24   Implementation Teams would be responsible for introducing new procedures and concepts in all&#13;
local offices. There would be 3-4 teams organized with 2-3 permanent members and 6-7 rotating&#13;
members. The team would include experienced staff from those local offices where new methods and&#13;
organizational changes have been already implemented. The team would work inside the local office for&#13;
about 4-6 weeks in order to ensure that the local office has understood the organizational and procedural&#13;
changes that are needed and that staff know how to use and maintain the computer systems. In essence,&#13;
the objective is to provide on-the-job coaching (assist the office in conducting field audits, and assist in&#13;
taxpayer education). The team would also help the office to start operations under the new structure and&#13;
would be available for follow-up activities. Each team would consist of:&#13;
a.     2 experts to help with Taxpayer Education and Services work;&#13;
b.     4 experts to help with Data Processing (Data Entry) work;&#13;
c.     4 experts to help with Audit work; and&#13;
d.     2 experts to help with Default Collections work.&#13;
7.25 The Site Preparation/lInstallation Team would consist of 5-6 people responsible for development&#13;
of standards for site preparation, supervision and coordination of local offices and hardware/software&#13;
suppliers in order to ensure timely and qualified installation of equipment. It would also be responsible&#13;
for initial installation of application software.&#13;
7.26   The Project Progress Evaluation Team would consist of 2 staff (possibly on a rotating basis) not&#13;
involved in the pilot project or in the current project. These staff would: (i) develop criteria for&#13;
assessing project progress and for evaluating the impact of changes introduced by the project; (ii) carry&#13;
out regular independent assessment of project progress; and (iii) carry out an independent evaluation of&#13;
gains in productivity and cost effectiveness of the new organizational structure and systems introduced&#13;
at the local offices. This quality control function would include, inter alia, evaluation of the performance&#13;
of tax inspectors in the execution of auditing and enforcement activities. It would also be responsible for&#13;
preparing for presentation to the Project Steering Committee, semiannual progress reports which would&#13;
include recommendations for possible improvements in the project.&#13;
7.27   The Users'Advisory Group would be responsible for assisting with preparations for local office&#13;
implementation. It would be consulted on all principal policy and operational issues. This group would&#13;
consist of 1 representative from each of the two selected regional office and 1 representative from each&#13;
of the selected local offices that would be implemented during the next period, implementation would take&#13;
place in 5 local offices each month.&#13;
7.28     Table 7.4 shows Summary of STS Staff Allocation for the Tax Administration Modernization&#13;
Project. During negotiations the Government provided satisfactory infornation that at least the minimum&#13;
number of relevant qualified staff by team, as shown in Table 7.4, would be assigned to work specifically&#13;
on the project.&#13;

2. Implementation Schediding&#13;
7.29   Overall implementation approach. The key features of the implementation strategy are:&#13;
a.    A strong Project Management Unit, supported by external advisers, capable of fully&#13;
coordinating implementation activities;&#13;
b.    A Steering Committee at the top, and users' groups at the working level, to ensure that&#13;
systems cover the needs of the offices, and to help identify and overcome difficulties of&#13;
introducing reforms;&#13;
c.    Simple procedures for the procurement and installation of equipment through the&#13;
consolidation of virtually all automation equipment in one bid with phased delivery, and&#13;
by including delivery and installation services in the same contract;&#13;
d.    A manageable implementation schedule that introduces automation at the rate of five local&#13;
offices per month so as to insure lessons learned can be fully reflected downstream;&#13;
e.    Training on the new systems and procedures on the job to maximize relevance and&#13;
immediate impact; and&#13;
f.    Special support during the first weeks of operation under the new arrangement to ensure&#13;
a smooth transition.&#13;
7.30   Similarly, the preparation for national implementation is cautious, pragmatic, and takes advantage&#13;
of external and local expertise available to review progress of implementation in the two target regions,&#13;
and the results of studies on organization issues, training, auditing, taxpayer education, automation, and&#13;
facilities.&#13;
7.31   The tight schedule and the complexity of the project require the use of computerized&#13;
implementation scheduling. A computerized planning system would be used for project progress tracking.&#13;
The Operations Manual would be prepared for use by all STS offices in the project. The Manual would&#13;
include not only the tax processing procedures, but also the internal planning procedures of the PMU.&#13;
7.32   The project scheduling would focus the activities on the main objectives and, more importantly,&#13;
establish interdependent and critical paths between the four major preparatory component parts of the&#13;
project, as well as the implementation in the field. (See Attachment 6).&#13;
7.33   The overall implementation plan consists of the following steps:&#13;
Preparatory Stage&#13;
a. The PMU would establish its planning and control systems as&#13;
well as its basic procedures by:                            Mar. 1995&#13;
b. Develop the organization framework, including design and&#13;
development of new systems and corresponding structures for&#13;
initial application:                                        May 1995&#13;
All this work would culminate in the production of an&#13;
Operations Manual:                                          Aug. 1995&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 54                                            Russia: Tax Adminitration Modernization Project&#13;
Implementation Teams would be trained in new systems and&#13;
be ready for general implementation in the selected regions:  Oct. 1995&#13;
c. Introducing automation in the Tax Offices. This would be a&#13;
major activity and would include system development and&#13;
definition and equipment specification and all the&#13;
procurement activities with the initial contract negotiated:  May 1995&#13;
The equipment would be delivered in stages, the first&#13;
delivery  coinciding  with  the  completion  of  the&#13;
organizational/systems components and training activities&#13;
prepared. Initial equipment systems would be on-line:       Oct. 1995&#13;
d. Training would be based on analysis and concentrate on new&#13;
procedures  and  work  systems.    Training  of  the&#13;
Implementation Team members would be completed:             Oct. 1995&#13;
Start of staff training in local offices which will proceed&#13;
during a lengthy period:                                   Aug. 1995&#13;
Implementation Stage&#13;
Implementation will start with five local offices on&#13;
and will continue with 5 offices every month:               Oct. 1995&#13;
The new systems including full functioning computerized&#13;
processing of all major federal taxes for legal entities with&#13;
computerized support of all the other activities should be&#13;
operational in the two selected regions with 110 local offices:  May 1997&#13;
The completion and closing dates for the project would be June 30, 1998 and December 31, 1998,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
3. Status of Project Preparation&#13;
7.34   The proposed project has reached an advanced stage of preparation. The STS has selected the&#13;
two regions to participate in the project. The two technical specialists financed by the IMF are in place&#13;
and would continue during at least the first year of implementation of the proposed project. The&#13;
automation component has been well designed and costed. Implementation planning has begun in earnest&#13;
and staff of the STS have already participated in the Bank's procurement seminars. The following&#13;
preparation was completed before negotiations of the project: (i) preparation of terms of reference for&#13;
the studies to be financed under the project, (ii) a detailed STS staff training plan, (iii) detailed equipment&#13;
specifications and bidding documents, and (iv) an overall project implementation manual. Key staff of&#13;
the Project Management Unit and Heads of key project implementation teams have been appointed.&#13;
Finally, the pilot project-from which the proposed project would draw lessons and experience-is&#13;
currently being implemented and is expected to be substantially completed by May 1995.&#13;

D.    Procurenent&#13;
7.35   Procurement under this project would be the responsibility of the Project Management Unit ( the&#13;
"PMU"), located within the State Tax Service organization. A procurement specialist would be hired by&#13;
the PMU to develop and administer its procurement operations. He/she would be familiar with World&#13;
Bank, and if needed, other donors' rules and procurement guidelines. The procurement specialist would&#13;
report to the project's Chief Technical Adviser. Procurement assistance would also include general&#13;
training on procedures and contract administration for other PMU members to support procurement of&#13;
computer equipment, systems and communications software, and consulting services for policy analyses,&#13;
tax administration, training and institutional development. PMU staff would implement the World Bank's&#13;
standard bidding and procurement documentation for goods and services, with needed addenda or&#13;
supplements, as approved by the Bank. The procurement specialist would ensure that the PMU conducts&#13;
solicitations, bid evaluations, contract award processes and procurement reporting as required by the&#13;
Bank. Terns of reference; prequalified vendor and consultant short lists; and bidding, evaluation and&#13;
contract documentation would be routed to the Bank, as appropriate, for needed reviews and no-&#13;
objections. PMU procurement staff would coordinate closely with the Project Implementation Division&#13;
to ensure purchases and deliveries are timed to fit local and regional office facility preparations and&#13;
personnel training activities. The PMU would include information on its procurement activities in&#13;
periodic reports to the World Bank.&#13;
7.36   Table 7.5 below is a summary of project elements, their approximate funding requirements and&#13;
the methodology envisioned for the procurement of each category of inputs. As outlined in the following&#13;
paragraphs, procurement would be implemented in accordance with relevant World Bank Guidelines and&#13;
standard bidding documents and contracts, as appropriate. General guidance on procurement policies and&#13;
procedures would also be available from Bank staff.&#13;

7.37   Procurement actions are expected to be undertaken within the following categories.&#13;
7.38   Technical Assistance.  A total of about US$3.6 million, including US$200,000 in services&#13;
funded under the proposed PPF, is allocated for Bank-financed procurement of professional and technical&#13;
services to assist STS staff with the planning, development and administration of tax system&#13;
improvements. The program is expected to need technical expertise for the design of: training materials,&#13;
curricula, teaching and skills evaluation techniques. There would also be a need for foreign assistance&#13;
in EDP work, conducting tax administration and taxpayer education seminars, and for assessing options&#13;
and developing policy and strategy papers for improvement of the STS and its national operations&#13;
conversion plan. The use of local consulting firms and personnel would be encouraged to develop the&#13;
domestic consulting industry. Besides IMF-supplied advisers, the project would engage experts in EDP,&#13;
training and materials development, and tax advisory assistance. Bank-financed consulting services would&#13;
be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers&#13;
and the World Bank as Executing Agency, published in August, 1981. The Bank's standard bidding and&#13;
contract documentation would be used. Solicitation methods and Terms of Reference for all consultant&#13;
assignments, and all procurement documentation and contracts with consulting firms valued at greater&#13;
than US$100,000 would be subject to prior Bank review and approval. Prior Bank review and approval&#13;
would also be required for short lists and contracts with individuals that are expected to exceed&#13;
US$50,000 each. There would be about eleven technical assistance and consulting contracts with firms&#13;
and/or individuals, totaling approximately US$2.8 million, that would be over US$100,000 and subject&#13;
to prior Bank review and approval. Contracts with individuals over US$50,000 are expected to number&#13;
about five, averaging US$70,000 and totalling about US$350,000. The other four expected consulting&#13;
contracts with firms, about US$86,000 each, and three contracts with individuals, averaging about&#13;
US$35,000 each, (and together totalling about US$450,000) would be subject to ex-post reviews on a&#13;
selective basis during supervision missions and/or as part of periodic procurement implementation&#13;
reviews. Where practicable, technical assistance, such as systems installation and/or maintenance services&#13;
would be sought in contracting packages to improve accountability and reduce costs and administrative&#13;
burdens. It is estimnated that about an additional US$1.2 million of the total proposed technical assitance&#13;
would be used to finance overseas fellowships and management study tours.&#13;
7.39  ICB Procurement. International Competitive Bidding (ICB) purchases would be conducted in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and lDA Credits, dated May,&#13;
1992. ICB procedures would be used for all computer systems and publications equipment purchases&#13;
expected to exceed US$300,000 per contract. Of the total of approximately US$12.0 million allocated&#13;
for the purchase of information technology and supporting equipment, US$9.9 million or about eighty-&#13;
three percent would be procured using ICB procedures. Principal categories for ICB procurement are&#13;
personal computers, printers, and related networking and systems equipment. In the comparison of bids&#13;
for equipment purchased under ICB, Russian manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of&#13;
fifteen percent or the existing customs duty that a nonexempt importer would have to pay, whichever is&#13;
lower, over the competing price of imports, providing domestic value-added is at least twenty percent.&#13;
The project is expected to have up to four successive ICB purchases of equipment, averaging&#13;
approximately US$2.6 million per contract. The Bank would review and clear ICB and prequalification&#13;
procedures (if used), bidding documents, evaluations and resulting contracts on an ex-ante basis; and&#13;
otherwise review and provide no-objections, as provided for in the Guidelines. Because Bank-financed&#13;
equipment and software purchases are expected to involve improving technologies and declining industry&#13;
prices, ICB purchases would be spread over a period of time that mirrors expected regional and local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 58                                            Russia: Tax Administration Modernization Project&#13;
offices' conversion and equipment installation schedules. Computer equipment suppliers would have to&#13;
demonstrate a capacity, at least by the time of tendering, successfully to supply, install and maintain the&#13;
equipment purchased. Standard Bank IT documentation and bidding procedures would be used for these&#13;
procurements.&#13;
7.40  Direct Contracting/lntemational Shopping. Direct Contracting (DC), as outlined in the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines, is expected to be employed in the procurement of some proprietary computer network&#13;
upgrades and software. Spare parts for equipment and Netware elements may also be appropriate for DC&#13;
purchases. Such procurements would be justified and procedures, documentation and prices reviewed&#13;
and cleared beforehand by the Bank. It is expected that Direct Contracting would involve about&#13;
US$300,000 in two contracting actions including purchases under a PPF. As required by the Guidelines,&#13;
all Direct Contracting documentation, awards and contracting actions would be subject to prior Bank&#13;
review and clearance. International Shopping (IS) may be authorized for readily available, off-the-shelf&#13;
purchases under US$300,000 per contract. International Shopping would be based on quotations from&#13;
at least three suppliers, from at least three different eligible countries, as indicated in the Guidelines.&#13;
International Shopping is expected to total about US$600,000 and involve three purchases averaging about&#13;
US$200,000 each. The first two IS actions would be subject to Bank prior review. All others would be&#13;
conducted on an ex-post basis during supervision missions or procurement reviews.&#13;
7.41   Local Competitve Bidding. Because they would not be attractive to foreign suppliers, some&#13;
network support equipment procurements that would be less than US$300,000 per contract would be&#13;
carried out using Local Competitive Bidding (LCB), as provided for in the Bank's Guidelines. Local&#13;
competitive bidding procedures would be established by the PMU and submitted to the Bank for review.&#13;
The four expected LCB actions are expected to total about US$700,000, and average about US$175,000&#13;
per purchase. As the Bank's Country Procurement Assessment Report has not yet been completed for&#13;
Russia and the Borrower's local competitive bidding process has not been approved by the Bank, the first&#13;
two LCB actions would be subject to Bank prior review to ensure such purchases would be carried out&#13;
in a manner consistent with relevant sections of the Guidelines.&#13;
7.42   Local Shopping. To support some regional and local tax office systems installations, it is&#13;
expected that the STS would need to initiate a few small value purchases using Local Shopping (LS)&#13;
techniques described in the Guidelines. LS purchases would complement STS-financed office upgrades&#13;
and are expected to cover contracts under US$50,000 each. These purchases would be used for small&#13;
value transactions for simple works and readily available, off-the-shelf items, such as fax machines and&#13;
office computers and printers. Local Shopping would be carried out by obtaining at least three price&#13;
quotations from different eligible suppliers. Such purchases are expected to number about twelve&#13;
transactions, averaging about US$42,000 each and totaling US$500,000 including purchases under a PPF.&#13;
The first two LS actions would be subject to Bank prior review. The other small value LS purchases&#13;
would be subject ex-post documentation reviews, with payments probably being effected by Special&#13;
Account and Statement of Expenditure.&#13;
7.43   Bank procurement supervision. In summary, ICB, DC and the first two IS, LCB and LS&#13;
purchases of automation goods would be subject to prior Bank reviews and no-objections, as provided&#13;
for in the Guidelines. Procurement of consulting services would be subject to prior Bank reviews for all&#13;
TORs, and for procedures, documentation and contracting with firms over US$100,000 and with&#13;
individuals over US$50,000. Procurements of goods and services would use the Bank's standard bidding&#13;
&#13;

and contracting documents, modified or supplemented as necessary, with Bank prior approval(s). This&#13;
procurement plan would result in the Bank's prior reviews, of approximately eighty-eight percent of total&#13;
Bank funds conmmitted for materials and equipment. In addition to reviewing TORs, Bank reviews of&#13;
contracting actions for tax administration, materials development, studies and EDP technical services&#13;
would cover an estimated eighty-eight percent of total Bank funding for technical assistance inputs.&#13;
Additional details on procurement can be found in Attachment 7.&#13;
7.44   Procurement approvals and reporting. A procurement specialist would be engaged to develop&#13;
procurement plans and establish procurement procedures. The specialist would help prepare documents&#13;
and, via consultations and site visits, guide STS staff with planning, bid packages, solicitations, bid&#13;
evaluations and reports, contracting and the PMU's periodic procurement implementation reporting&#13;
requirements. The procurement specialist would also help coordinate documentation flows needed to&#13;
secure the World Bank's clearances and "no-objections" on consultants' TORs and equipment packages&#13;
requiring prior Bank review. In addition, Bank staff would monitor procurement activities, contract&#13;
administration and project record keeping during periodic supervision missions. (See Attachment 8.)&#13;
E.    Project Accounting, Financial, Auditing and Progress Reporting&#13;
7.45  Accounting.  The Borrower would be responsible for the appropriate accounting of funds&#13;
provided by the Bank under the Loan, for reporting on the use of these funds, and for ensuring that audits&#13;
of the financial statements or reports are submitted to the Bank. Audits would be carried out by auditors&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
7.46   The Project Management Unit (on behalf of the Borrower) would establish an appropriate project&#13;
accounting system to provide information on the proper receipt and use of funds in accordance with the&#13;
Loan Agreement. The system should ensure timely and accurate accounting of all transactions under the&#13;
Loan and clear presentation of the financial informnation.&#13;
7.47   Financial Reporting. Financial reporting, to be developed and carried out by the PMU would&#13;
include a statement of receipts and payments for the reporting period since the beginning of the program.&#13;
The reporting would be in accordance with the disbursements classified and reported by the expenditure&#13;
categories agreed with the Borrower and spelled out in the Loan Agreements. Quarterly progress reports&#13;
would be submitted, including a separate section on activities under Statement of Expenditure and the&#13;
Special Account. A Project Completion Report would be submitted to the Bank by the PMU promptly&#13;
after the completion of the program, and in any event not later than six months after the Loan closing&#13;
date.&#13;
7.48   Auditing. During negotiations assurances were provided by the Government that the financial&#13;
statements and reports on the Loan (including the Special Account) would be audited annually in&#13;
accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards by independent auditors (preferably an&#13;
international accounting/auditing firm) acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
7.49   The criteria for selecting auditors would be as follows: (i) impartial and independent from the&#13;
entity to be audited; (ii) well established and reputable; (iii) experienced in the type of assignment to be&#13;
undertaken; and (iv) able to fulfill the terms of reference required with the specific timetable.&#13;

7.50   The audit report would be submitted to the Bank by the Government within six months of the end&#13;
of the reporting period, i.e. the fiscal year end. The audit would cover a review of all expenditures under&#13;
the project and supporting documentation, including customs documentation.&#13;
7.51   Progress Reporting. Quarterly progress reports covering all project activities would be prepared&#13;
by the PMU and sent to the World Bank and IMF within one month of the end of the quarter in a format&#13;
to be agreed with the Bank. The main purpose of the reports would be to provide managers with timely&#13;
information on iniplementation of Project components. It would be the responsibility of the PMU to set-&#13;
up reporting guidelines and deadlines so that it receives timely information from the Regions and the&#13;
Special Account bank(s) in order to prepare the report. The first report would be issued before the first&#13;
supervision mission. The quarterly reports would include, inter alia:&#13;
a.      Progress achieved against agreed implementation and disbursement schedules, and key&#13;
performance indicators;&#13;
b.      Status of all procurement activities and contracts;&#13;
c.      Work programs and proposed expenditures for the coming quarter; and&#13;
d.      Discussion of issues or problems, if any, in managing the project and disbursing the Loan&#13;

Special Account&#13;
7.54   The Special Account (SA) would be maintained in a commercial bank selected by the Government&#13;
and acceptable to the World Bank. This bank would be selected, from a number of acceptable banks,&#13;
on the basis of competitive bids. Selection criteria for participation in the bids are:&#13;
a.    The bank should be financially sound as demonstrated by their latest accounts, as audited&#13;
by an internationally recognized accounting firms;&#13;
b.    The bank should have a significant foreign correspondence network covering all major&#13;
currencies;&#13;
c.    The bank should have a reasonable capacity and experience for issuing letters of credit,&#13;
for making direct foreign payments and other international transactions, with appropriate&#13;
arrangements for the training and development of their staff;&#13;
d.    The bank should be capable of performing a wide range of local banking services,&#13;
including cash payments, transfers to other domestic banks, issuance of debit notes,&#13;
application of conversion rates from foreign currencies, and maintenance of adequate&#13;
accounts for the SA;&#13;
e.    The bank should preferably be a member of Swift (Society for Worldwide Interbank&#13;
Financial Telecommunications) and should routinely use or plan to use this facility to&#13;
expedite payment transfers;&#13;
f.    The bank should be willing to issue a Comfort Letter to assure that amounts deposited&#13;
in a Special Account will not be set off or otherwise seized or attached to satisfy amounts&#13;
due to the commercial bank by the borrower;&#13;
g.    The bank should be willing to maintain adequate accounts as required by the World&#13;
Bank, provide monthly bank statements to the World Bank and, any other information&#13;
considered necessary. Copies of all transactions would be routinely submitted to the&#13;
STS;&#13;
h.    The bank should be willing to charge reasonable rates for their services and provide&#13;
reasonable interest on balances held from time to time.&#13;
7.55   The maximum authorization amount to be deposited in the SA would be US$500,000. The initial&#13;
deposit would be at the start of the project implementation, US$100,000 and would be increased to&#13;
US$500,000. The SA would be opened in the name of the Borrower and would be administered by&#13;
authorized representatives of the STS. All requests for replenishment would be submitted at frequent&#13;
intervals to the Bank through the PMU. Documentation requirements for replenishment applications&#13;
would follow procedures described in the Disbursement Handbook.  These requests would be&#13;
accompanied by detailed monthly bank statements of the SA and by all other required documentation.&#13;
G.    Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
7.56   Monitoring and evaluation would proceed on several levels. Level 1 would focus on monitoring&#13;
execution of activities in relation to the project schedule. This would be done with the assistance of a&#13;
computerized tracking system.  Level 2 would focus on the delivery of project inputs, e.g.&#13;
implementation of the new tax administration system in local offices, concentrating on whether new&#13;
procedures were introduced, installation and operation of computerized systems, training conducted and&#13;
operation of the implementation teams.  Level 3 evaluation would focus on outputs in terms of&#13;
&#13;

Techniad Axnex&#13;
Russia: Tax Administration Modernization Project                                     Page 63&#13;
achievement of targets of the project in terms of (i) restructuring and procedural changes, (ii) automation&#13;
systems, (iii) staff training, and (iv) management information systems. Level 4 would deal with the effect&#13;
or impact of project outputs on compliance, the effectiveness of tax collection, fairness of the system and&#13;
tax revenues. Attachment 8 shows indicators of project monitoring and impact.&#13;
H.    Project Sustainability&#13;
7.57   The proposed project does not pose any unusual difficulties to be sustained over the long term.&#13;
It is an integral part of a long-range program of reforms which enjoys top priority with the STS and the&#13;
Government as a whole. The Government, accordingly, has fully budgeted the implementation expenses&#13;
that would be incurred by the STS and the project does not require substantially more resources for the&#13;
tax staffing budgets. In fact, an integral aim of the project is to use those existing resources more&#13;
efficiently. Adequate provisions have been made under the project for technical sustainability. Support&#13;
groups would continue at the center to provide technical support and maintenance for the systems installed&#13;
under the project. Moreover, provisions have been made for continuous training of staff to keep them&#13;
abreast of technological improvements in the system.&#13;
I.     Bank Supervision&#13;
7.58   The Bank and IMF have made a satisfactory agreement on division of responsibilities for&#13;
supervision of the project. The IMF would be responsible for providing technical assistance to the&#13;
Russian Federation related to tax policy and administration. The Bank would retain overall supervision&#13;
responsibilities and would be responsible for supervision of systems design and implementation,&#13;
procurement and disbursements. The tentative Bank supervision plan, calling for field reviews of about&#13;
6-7 staff weeks per annum, appears in Attachment 9. Bank supervision missions would be timed to&#13;
coincide with IMF review visits to ensure coordination.&#13;

A.    Benefits&#13;
8.1    The proposed project is designed to achieve a more effective and efficient tax administration in&#13;
two regions, and would prepare the way for modernization nation-wide. Increased effectiveness would&#13;
be manifested in better tax collections through automation, a national audit strategy and better&#13;
management infornation systems. The project would also contribute to increased fairness in the tax&#13;
system by enabling the application of more uniform treatment of taxpayers. Increased efficiency would&#13;
be evidenced in faster processing of tax payments and returns. The main efficiency gains would occur&#13;
over time when the STS could handle increased numbers of taxpayers and returns with little or no&#13;
increase in staffing levels. Automation would mean that the STS could cope with increased workloads&#13;
virtually within the envelope of existing resources. The project would also contribute to expansion of the&#13;
tax base through more effective registration, better information systems and better taxpayer education and&#13;
public awareness. Increased compliance would also be the result of lowering the private cost of&#13;
compliance (through simpler tax forms and elimination of the need for enterprises to visit tax offices),&#13;
increasing the cost of non-compliance (through better detection systems and more effective auditing) and&#13;
the perception of increased fairness in the system. All these factors could contribute ultimately to&#13;
increases in tax revenues.&#13;
B.    Risks&#13;
8.2    The proposed project alone cannot guarantee increased revenues without parallel action on&#13;
improving tax legislation and policies (for examnple, simplifying taxation). In addition, there is a risk that&#13;
conditions outside the project would prevent it from realizing its full benefits, e.g. the "protection" levies&#13;
extracted by organized crime that act as an unofficial tax on business revenues and tend to reduce&#13;
compliance with official taxes. All organizational changes run into resistance of varying degrees. Within&#13;
the project, full implementation of the modernization program could be compromised by lack of&#13;
acceptance of the intended reforms. For this reason the project features the "users' groups" to smooth&#13;
the acceptance of innovations. Staff training is intended to ensure proper use of the new systems. The&#13;
pace of implementation could also be affected by changes in tax legislation, changes in accounting&#13;
methods or regulations requiring changes in project software. Change has been anticipated in project&#13;
design: systems and procedures can be adapted to new regulations without major cost or delay. Other&#13;
potential risks are as follows:&#13;
a.     The training to be provided to STS staff would raise their value in the labor market. If&#13;
STS salaries and benefits are not attractive, staff turnover could become a problem,&#13;
particularly in urban areas.  This can be countered partly by offering training&#13;
opportunities to individuals remaining in the STS as part of their career development&#13;
plan, and by making advanced training a condition for promotion. In some locations the&#13;
STS may have learn to live with high staff turnover and plan for continuous training of&#13;
new staff. In this contest training should be practical, efficient and job-oriented, so that&#13;
learning and working become virtually identical. In another sense, high staff turnover&#13;
can be regarded as a positive outcome to the extent that trained former STS staff help&#13;
private business improve their accounting, auditing and tax reporting practices.&#13;
&#13;

b.     The benefits of taxpayer education are not well understood at present and could be&#13;
vulnerable to early cuts should budgetary resources become constrained.&#13;
Procurement, delivery and installation of equipment to about 110 different locations is a logistical&#13;
challenge with the risk of misplacement or improper installation of equipment. The STS intends to&#13;
minimize this risk through the inclusion of final installation in bidding documents and use of independent&#13;
agents for verification.&#13;
8.3    Overall, the risks have been minimized through the phased approach. This approach permits&#13;
adjustments in design based on the lessons from experience in the pilot project. In the final analysis,&#13;
however, the greatest risk is loss of potential revenues without the measures included in the project; the&#13;
STS would not have sufficient institutional capacity to capture new revenues as the private sector grows&#13;
and the tax base expands.&#13;

ATrACEMENT 3: DETAID STS PROECT STAFF TRAING PLAN&#13;
A. Introbduction and Summary&#13;
1.  The Tax Modernization Project introduces three simultaneous innovations in the tax system: new&#13;
organizational structures, new operating procedures (including the use of computers), and new staffing&#13;
profiles. Since these three changes widely affect the STS staff member involved in the project, training&#13;
would be required to ensure that staff members have the necessary knowledge, information and skills to&#13;
perform their jobs adequately. Given the fact that both procedures and contents are new to virtually all&#13;
staff members involved, no additional training needs analysis is required.&#13;
2.   Basic and advanced training in accounting and auditing, as well as tax-specific knowledge, are&#13;
required for most of the technical staff. Given the existing level of knowledge about accounting and&#13;
auditing, the legislative and regulatory changes, and the changes in accounting and auditing (both in&#13;
principles and practices) which would inevitably occur, further training on these issues would also be&#13;
necessary. The project, however, would limit its training activities directly related to the information and&#13;
skill associated with the modernization and automation aspects. Technical training in accounting and&#13;
auditing, tax-specific training as well as general management training would continue to be performed&#13;
by the training unit of the STS. Excluded from this training program are also the information campaigns&#13;
and training activities to be organized by the taxpayer educators, and which constitute an important&#13;
training dimension of the Tax Modernization Project.&#13;
3.  In order to ensure consistency, standardization and efficiency, most of the training would rely on&#13;
standardized training programs, manuals and materials. As a pilot project, many of the training&#13;
materials, strategies and experience accumulated during this phase would be directly useful for further&#13;
expansion of the project. In this way, a substantial part of the training efforts-particularly the&#13;
development of instructional materials and the professional development of the trainers allocated to this&#13;
project-can be considered as an R&amp;D investment in the future expansion of the project.&#13;
B.  Training Needs&#13;
4.   Annex 1 to this Attachment presents a summary of the training needs which would be addressed&#13;
during this project. As illustrated in columns one and two, the training needs for the project were derived&#13;
directly from the tasks involved in each function and the information/knowledge/sklls required for the&#13;
performance of these tasks. The level in which these needs are required varies with the nature of the&#13;
function. For example, different occupational categories would be involved with different types of&#13;
software or report writing requirements, and thus would receive different types of training, although the&#13;
title of the course would be the same.&#13;
5.   Annex 1 excludes basic and advanced training needed in areas such as accounting, auditing, tax-&#13;
specific management, for both old and new staff. Even though training in all areas is required, it should&#13;
be included under the normal training activities coordinated by the STS training unit.&#13;
&#13;

C. Training Program: Content and Duration&#13;
6.   Table 6.3 provides an overview of the structure of the training program, broken down by categories&#13;
of staff. Most of the training would be implemented through on-the-job training activities. Overall, all&#13;
the 3,500 staff members involved in the modernization project would participate in at least two training&#13;
activities (the general introduction about the reform and computer-specific training). Some groups would&#13;
be involved in 3 or more specific training activities which may last from 2 to 10 days, in the case of&#13;
formal training sessions.&#13;
7.   The actual content and duration of each training activity would vary according to each category of&#13;
staff, even though these activities may have the same name such as computer-related training or report&#13;
writing. The actual content and methodology for each training activity for each group would be presented&#13;
in more detailed by the project training unit. The number of formal training course sessions and&#13;
participants in each course would also vary according to the expansion strategy adopted. For example,&#13;
if five new local offices would be included in the program at each time, the number of participants in&#13;
each course would be determined by the number of staff members in the various occupational categories.&#13;
D. Training Strategy&#13;
1. Planning and Instructional Design&#13;
8.   Project-related training would be carefully designed by the project training unit, in order to ensure&#13;
an optimum timing of training activities. There would be specific training guidelines concerning the&#13;
contents, methodology, duration and evaluation of each training activity, for each group of participants.&#13;
Substantive investments would be made in the design and preparation of training materials.&#13;
2. Implementation: The Thrining Cycle&#13;
9.  In order to maximize its impact, training would follow the timing of project implementation. Thus,&#13;
the typical training cycle would be designed around the training needs of a given local office.&#13;
10. First, managers and the officer in charge of training technologies would be brought for a hands-on,&#13;
demonstration-cum-training workshop in a centralized location-ideally this should be close to or in an&#13;
office where modernization has already been successfully implemented. They would receive general&#13;
information/training about all the features of the modernization program and specific information about&#13;
the routines and software for which they are responsible. Managers would also be trained on techniques&#13;
related to planning training and coaching.&#13;
11. Immediately before, during or immediately after installation of new equipment and start of the&#13;
modernization process in a given agency, staff at all levels would receive the training adequate to their&#13;
respective function. This could take the form of on-the-job training, in service training or residential&#13;
training outside the local office. The decision concerning the time and location of training would depend&#13;
on the strategy adopted for expansion. In principle, staff from several offices undergoing modernization&#13;
could be pooled together to form a training group of a cost-effective size.&#13;

3. Types of Training Activities&#13;
12. There would be three main types of training activities, on-the-job training, formal courses and&#13;
special training programs.&#13;
(a) On-the-job training (OJT)&#13;
13. The majority of the training activities would be delivered through organized and carefully&#13;
implemented on-the-job training activities. Except as noted below, the great majority of training activities&#13;
would be performed through OJT. There are three major reasons for choosing OJT as the primary&#13;
method of training. One comes from the comparative advantage of Russia. The entire workforce has&#13;
advanced levels of education. The people are used to self-study, and have a fairly widespread familiarity&#13;
with technical subjects, including computers. Second, most of the training needed at the early stages of&#13;
project implementation would relate to information and operational, rather than conceptual issues, which&#13;
can be better grasped through hands-on training. The third consideration is cost-effectiveness. OJT&#13;
supported by high quality manuals and training materials can ensure a quick, national dissemination of&#13;
training while maintaining uniformly high standards.&#13;
14. OJT would be implemented under the direct responsibility of the immediate supervisor of each&#13;
individual being trained. The manager of each regional office would be ultimately responsible for&#13;
ensuring adequate training.&#13;
15. OJT would be based on a detailed job-description, carefully prepared operations manuals and,&#13;
whenever required, training guidelines and training materials. Supervisors and office managers would&#13;
receive special training on OJT techniques and specific instructions about their responsibilities. Timing&#13;
of training is also a critical variable, since individuals in each office would have to be trained just before&#13;
and during the initial weeks of project implementation.&#13;
16. Operations and other training materials would rely basically on printed and computer-based&#13;
tutorials. These materials would be developed in such a way that updates would become simple to&#13;
prepare, efficient and cost-effective. This would facilitate updating the information as well as retraining&#13;
individuals affected by changes in operations. These materials would also serve as training materials for&#13;
future expansion of the project to other offices, thus contributing to a decrease in training costs.&#13;
(b) Formal Training&#13;
17.  Table 6.4 summarizes formal training activities to be undertaken during the project. The actual&#13;
duration and content of the courses would vary according to the characteristics of the target-audience for&#13;
the various courses, as well as to the timing and speed of project implementation in new offices.&#13;
18. Formal training would be based on standardized contents, as well as carefully prepared,&#13;
standardized instructional materials, teaching methods and evaluations activities. Training would be&#13;
totally job-oriented, with emphasis placed on introducing and explaining the new practices being adopted.&#13;
Training would be planned and delivered by a group of 10 previously selected trainers to form a core&#13;
group of trainers. Additional trainers would be managers, immediate supervisors and subject-matter&#13;
experts drawn from the various regional offices.&#13;
&#13;

Page 76                                              Russia: Tax Admuiistration Modernization Projec&#13;
19. Training methods would include printed and video-materials, operations manuals, training manuals&#13;
including texts and case studies, computers and tutorials, group exercises and other simulation activities&#13;
to teach interpersonal skills. Video-tapes would be used primarily to disseminate standard and clear&#13;
information about the purpose and functioning of the project and its various components. The videotapes&#13;
would also illustrate how work is actually performed in offices which have already implemented the&#13;
changes. Tapes can also be used to record the opinions and perceptions of managers, staff and client,&#13;
in order to create a favorable climate of opinion towards the change. Preparation of training materials&#13;
may involve development of new materials, as well as adaptation an translation of existing materials from&#13;
other countries or institutions.&#13;
(c) Special Training Programs&#13;
20. In addition to OJT and formal training, two other types of training would be necessary to support&#13;
the overall training effort: training of managers and supervisors and training of the trainers.&#13;
21. Managers and supervisors would be trained in project specific activities which would include a&#13;
thorough knowledge of the reform, specific training on the systems, routines and operations under their&#13;
direct responsibility and coaching techniques. Managers and supervisors would also be trained to provide&#13;
feedback to the central training unit concerning the quality of operations and of the training manuals, so&#13;
that they can be improved as the project expands. In order to make training more realistic and concrete,&#13;
and to facilitate acceptance of the changes, managers would be trained at the same time that they visit&#13;
modernized tax offices in their respective regions, in order to know first-hand about how the reforms&#13;
work. Some managers would also be invited for study tours abroad, on the basis of criteria to be&#13;
established in the detailed training plan.&#13;
E. The Management of Training&#13;
22.  There would be 10 trainers allocated full-time for this project. In principle, two trainers would be&#13;
in charge of overall planning, supervision and evaluation, and would be located in Moscow. Four full-&#13;
time trainers would be recruited and retained in each region, and would be involved in both regional&#13;
planning and actual training delivery. It is expected that these trainers would be selected on the basis of&#13;
their professional experience and expertise in accounting and auditing, so as to serve not only as training&#13;
experts, but also as professional role models.&#13;
23. A National Training Adviser would be retained during the first 18 months of the project. One of&#13;
the major tasks of the Training Adviser would be to develop a training plan for the trainers and actually&#13;
train and coach the project trainers in training techniques, including planning, development of&#13;
instructional materials, training techniques, evaluation and related training issues. During the first two&#13;
or three months of the project all trainers would probably need to work together in Moscow. The&#13;
following table illustrates the typical training cycle of the activities of the trainers.&#13;

Russia: Tax Administration Modernization Project                                           Page 77&#13;
Typical Work Cycle&#13;
(For a given region):&#13;
1.   Identify the training targets (trainees: functions, quantities, timetable)&#13;
2.   Define training objectives for each activity or group of activities (for a group of offices)&#13;
3.   Detail training strategy&#13;
4.   Define training contents&#13;
5.   Identify/develop/adapt/translate/commnission training materials (may include participating in&#13;
the development of operations manuals)&#13;
6.   Revise/field test training materials and operations manuals (in the initial stages this can be&#13;
done in real-time, with trainees participating in implementation activities).&#13;
7.   Revise training materials&#13;
8.   Implement training program on a mass scale&#13;
24. It is expected that trainers would be involved in various activities including planning,&#13;
development/adaptation of instructional materials, commissioning, field-testing and evaluating training&#13;
materials developed by others and participating in the actual delivery of training. These 10 trainers would&#13;
also be responsible for training managers and supervisors in coaching techniques as well as working&#13;
closely with consultants and other experts to develop and field-test the operations manuals which would&#13;
serve as the basis for most of the OJT training activities.&#13;
25. Trainers would also be linked with the International Tax Training Center (ITTC) in order to&#13;
coordinate international technical assistance with their own activities, including their own training and&#13;
professional development. It is possible that the training expert would be located at the MlC, or at least&#13;
to have close relationships with the Center.&#13;
F.   The National Training Plan&#13;
26.  A by-product of the Training Adviser's work and of the activities of the trainers should be the&#13;
preparation of the National Training Program, i.e. a plan for staff training to support national&#13;
implementation of the new tax administration system.&#13;
G. Resources and Costs&#13;
27. Annex 2 to this Attachment summarizes the resources and costs involved in the training component.&#13;
Most of the expenditures would be related to training delivery, in particular for travel and&#13;
accommodations. Not included in this figure are the opportunity costs, i.e. the salaries being drawn by&#13;
the participants while being trained. Depending on the implementation strategy, offices being modernized&#13;
could be utilized for formal training activities, if space and facilities are adequate. That would minimize&#13;
the need to acquire additional computers and other equipment for training.&#13;
&#13;

28. A substantial part of the training budget would be allocated for the development of instructional&#13;
materials. Part of these resources would be spent on standardized manuals and training materials, in an&#13;
effort to maintain high standards, cost-effectiveness and efficiency as the system evolves and expands.&#13;
The initial fornatting of both operations manuals and training materials should be carefully designed, in&#13;
order to ensure standardization and to save costs in the future. A major part of these resources would&#13;
actually be used to develop new instructional materials, particularly:&#13;
a.   Videotapes. One set of videos could be used to explain the reform and provide all the&#13;
relevant information and examples, including opinions from managers and users (to be&#13;
updated as the system expands). This video, accompanied by printed materials, should&#13;
provide staff involved with a clear understanding of the entire reform, its characteristics,&#13;
benefits and how it affects each individual. Another video, or set of videos, could be used&#13;
to show how the various components of the program are implemented in other offices, and&#13;
may include actual interviews of managers, staff and clients. These videos should be used&#13;
to impart standard information as well as to motivate and mobilize people for the reform.&#13;
b.   Tutorials. Most of the OJT training would be based on carefully prepared operations and/or&#13;
training manuals. Most of the computer training and other components, such as filling out&#13;
forms and report writing could also be taught efficiently through carefully prepared tutorials&#13;
(computer-assisted instruction).  In addition to project funds, US-AID, through the&#13;
International Tax Training Centers, could provide additional expertise and resources for the&#13;
preparation of additional tutorials.&#13;
c.   Case studies and practical exercises. New training materials are required, particularly to&#13;
each new skills such as investigative auditing and human relations. Case studies, simple&#13;
simulations, and other practical activities need to be developed, taking into consideration the&#13;
lack of experience and local traditions with the use of such methods.&#13;
H.  International Cooperation&#13;
29. The success of the training program is intimately related to its ability to incorporate new training&#13;
strategies and techniques which would make training more flexible and cost-effective. Otherwise it would&#13;
be very difficult to ensure high-quality, time training to disseminate the project to the entire country.&#13;
Over time, as the project consolidates, it is expected that what has been learned would be absorbed by&#13;
the existing training unit of the STS. International cooperation is thus needed to ensure that a qualitative&#13;
change in training policies and practices occurs through a carefully planned transfer of training&#13;
technologies mediated by the 10 training experts.&#13;
30. The International Tax Training Center should serve as a bridge between the international training&#13;
community and the trainers of the STS. The Training Advisor should be located there, or at least work&#13;
in close collaboration with the ITTC and the institutions linked to it. He/she should also use the Center&#13;
to introduce Russian trainers to the international community of training and modern training practices,&#13;
and to manage the process of technology transfers and modernization of training practices.&#13;

            The overall objective of the Tax
            Administration Modernization Project is to help develop and
            install an effective and efficient national system of tax
            administration. The project will create the infrastructure
            needed to collect and process intended tax revenues at
            reasonable cost and speed from an expanding tax base. The
            specific objectives of the project are: 1) to modernize tax
            administration in two regions (Nizhny Novgorod and
            Volgograd) with about 110 local offices through
            reorganization of structures and procedures, automation and
            staff training; and 2) to assist in the institutional
            development of tax administration by building the capacity
            of the State Tax Services, preparing for nationwide
            implementation of tax administration reforms, and providing
            product management support. To achieve these objectives the
            project will finance: expert services (both Russian and
            international); staff training; acquisition of hardware and
            software; and minor improvements of offices to accommodate computerization.
