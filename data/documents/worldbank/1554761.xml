FOREWORD&#13;
This paper is one in a special series of World Bank Staff&#13;
Working Papers on population change and development.      Prepared as&#13;
background papers for the World Development Report 1984, they&#13;
provide more detailed treatment and documentation of the issues&#13;
dealt with in Part II of the Report.     The papers cover a range of&#13;
topics, including the effects of population growth and change on&#13;
economic development, the determinants of fertility and mortality,&#13;
the links between population growth and internal and international&#13;
migration, and the management, financing, and effectiveness of&#13;
family  planning   programs.    They  include   several  country  and&#13;
regional studies of fertility change and population policy.&#13;
The background papers draw on a large number of published&#13;
and unpublished studies of individual researchers, on Bank policy&#13;
analysis and research, and on reports of other organizations&#13;
working on population and development programs and issues.        The&#13;
papers   are   the   work   of   individuals   and   the  views   and&#13;
interpretations expressed in them do not necessarily coincide with&#13;
the views and interpretations of the Report itself.&#13;
I hope these detailed studies will supplement the World&#13;
Development Report: 1984 in furthering understanding of population&#13;
and  development   issues   among   students  and  practitioners   of&#13;
development.&#13;

Abstract&#13;
This paper examines whether and how international economic&#13;
relations between the industrialized and the developing countries might&#13;
accommodate the growing North-South demographic and income gaps.     Three&#13;
channels of international relations are analyzed: trade, capital move-&#13;
ments, and international migration.      The trade-offs, if any, between&#13;
trade and factor movements, and between capital movements and inter-&#13;
national migration, are also investigated.    The study combines economic&#13;
theory and historical evidence on trade and factor movements.&#13;
In examining the interrelationship between population growth&#13;
and international trade, the paper points up results from regression&#13;
analysis which indicate that the accumulation of human capital is a&#13;
necessary condition for success in exporting manufactured products.     In&#13;
relatively human capital abundant developing countries, the fact that&#13;
population and labor force are often growing rapidly compared to the&#13;
industrialized countries does not determine whether or not these&#13;
countries export manufactures, though the product composition of such&#13;
exports may be affected.    In human capital poor developing countries,&#13;
rapid population and labor force growth actually compromise their&#13;
opportunity to participate in the worldwide expansion of manufactured&#13;
exports.   For these countries, there is little or no possibility for&#13;
export growth to accommodate their rapid population growth.&#13;
The effects of population growth on factor movements between&#13;
the developing and :he industrialized countries are investWigated with&#13;
a review of labor immigration into the United States, labor immigration&#13;
into Europe, and capi'tal export from Japan. The position adopted in the&#13;
paper is that trade 'is generally to be preferred to either capital move-&#13;
ments  or labor migration.      However,   even  free  trade might   leave&#13;
disparities in factor prices and, hence, international factor movements&#13;
might be required for achieving world efficiency.      Finally, the paper&#13;
notes that the "right: type" of capital exports (a la Japan) is likely to&#13;
have a much more favorable impact on the dynamics of comparative&#13;
advantage than the "wrong type" of labor imports (a la Europe).&#13;

Condense&#13;
Ce document tente de d6terminer si (et, dans l'affirmative, com-&#13;
ment) les relations economiques internationales entre pays industrialises&#13;
et en developpement pourraient jouer un role positif du point de vue de&#13;
l'ecart croissant existant entre le Nord et le Sud en matiere de popula-&#13;
tion et de revenu. Trois modes de relations internationales sont analyses&#13;
ici : les echanges, les mouvements de capitaux et les migrations interna-&#13;
tionales. L'interaction 6ventuelle, d'une part, entre le commerce et les&#13;
mouvements de facteurs et, d'autre part, entre les mouvements de capitaux&#13;
et les migrations internationales est egalement etudi6e. L'etude s'appuie&#13;
a la fois sur la theorie economique et des donn6es precises concernant les&#13;
echanges commerciaux et les mouvements de facteurs enregistres par le&#13;
passe.&#13;
En examinant la relation mutuelle qui existe entre l'accroisse-&#13;
ment d6mographique et les echanges internationaux, le document signale les&#13;
resultats d'une analyse de regression qui indique que sans accumulation de&#13;
capital humain, il est impossible de parvenir a exporter des produits&#13;
manufactures. Dans les pays en developpement relativement riches en&#13;
capitaux, le fait que la population et la main-d'oeuvre s'accroissent&#13;
souvent plus rapidement que celles des pays industrialises n'est pas&#13;
l'element qui explique que ces pays exportent ou non des produits manufac-&#13;
tur6s, bien qu'il puisse influer sur la composition par produits de ces&#13;
exportations. Par contre, les pays en d6veloppement oil les capitaux sont&#13;
rares voient le rapide accroissement de la population et de la main-&#13;
d'oeuvre compromettre effectivement leurs chances de participer a l'expan-&#13;
sion mondiale des exportations de biens manufactures. La possibilite&#13;
qu'ont ces pays d'accroitre leurs exportations dans des proportions compa-&#13;
rables a leur rapide accroissement d6mographique est faible oui nulle.&#13;
Ce document etudie les effets de 1'accroissement d6mographique&#13;
sur les mouvements de facteurs entre pays en developpement et pays indus-&#13;
trialises en examinant l'immigration de main-d'oeuvre aux Etats-Unis et en&#13;
Europe ainsi que les exportations de capitaux du Japon. I1 en ressort&#13;
qu'il vaut mieux, en general, donner la pr6ference aux 6changes plutot&#13;
qu'aux mouvements de capitaux ou aux migrations de main-d'oeuvre.   Toute-&#13;
fois, meme le libre-6change peut laisser persister des diff6rences au&#13;
niveau des prix des facteurs et, par consequent, des mouvements de fac-&#13;
teurs internationaux sont peut-etre necessaires si l'on veut parvenir a&#13;
une certaine efficacit6 au niveau mondial.   Le document constate enfin que&#13;
le "type appropri6" d'exportations de capitaux (a la japonaise) a des&#13;
chances d'avoir une incidence beaucoup plus favorable sur la dynamique de&#13;
l'avantage comparatif que le "type erron6" d'importations de main-d'oeuvre&#13;
(comme celles que l'on observe en Europe).&#13;

Extracto&#13;
En este doctumento de trabajo se examina la cuesti6n de si las&#13;
relaciones econ6micas internacionales entre los paises industrializados y&#13;
los que estAn en proceso de desarrollo podrian ajustarse a las crecientes&#13;
diferencias demogrAficas y de ingresos entre el Norte y el Sur, y c6mo&#13;
podria ello hacerse. Se analizan tres de los cauces a traves de los cua-&#13;
les se desarrollan las; relaciones internacionales, a saber: el comercio,&#13;
los movimientos de capital y las migraciones internacionales. Se investi-&#13;
gan asimismo las compensaciones reciprocas, de haberlas, entre el comercio&#13;
y los movimientos de factores y entre los movimientos de capital y las&#13;
migraciones internacicinales. El estudio combina la teoria econ6mica y&#13;
datos hist6ricos sobre el intercambio comercial y los movimientos de&#13;
factores.&#13;
Al examinar las interrelaciones entre el crecimiento de la&#13;
poblaci6n y el comercio internacional, el estudio muestra resultados obte-&#13;
nidos mediante anAlisis de regresi6n que indican que la acumulaci6n de&#13;
capital humano es una condici6n necesaria para lograr el exito en la&#13;
exportaci6n de product:os manufacturados. En los paises en desarrollo que&#13;
tienen una abundancia relativa de capital, el hecho de que la. poblaci6n y&#13;
la fuerza de trabajo aumentan con frecuencia rApidamente en comnparaci6n&#13;
con los paises industrializados no determina el que exporten o no manufac-&#13;
turas, aunque si puede hacer que resulte afectada la composici6n por pro-&#13;
ductos de tales exportaciones. En paises en desarrollo pobres en capital,&#13;
el rapido crecimiento de la poblaci6n y la fuerza de trabajo pone en peli-&#13;
gro efectivamente su oportunidad de participar en la expansi6n mundial de&#13;
las exportaciones de productos manufacturados. En el caso de estos pai-&#13;
ses, las posibilidades de que el aumento de las exportaciones se ajuste al&#13;
rApido crecimiento de su poblaci6n son escasas o nulas.&#13;
Los efectos del crecimiento de la poblaci6n en los movimientos&#13;
de factores entre los paises en desarrollo y los industriali2zados se&#13;
investigan por medio de un examen de la inmigraci6n de mano cle obra a los&#13;
Estados Unidos, la inrmigraci6n de mano de obra a Europa y la exportaci6n&#13;
de capital del Jap6n. La postura adoptada en el presente estudio es la de&#13;
que, en general, el comercio es preferible a los movimientos de capital o&#13;
a la migraci6n de mano de obra. Ahora bien, cabe que incluso el comercio&#13;
libre deje como legado disparidades en los precios de los factores, y de&#13;
ahi que quizas los movimientos internacionales de factores se!an necesarios&#13;
para lograr la eficiencia a nivel mnundial. Por dltimo, en el. estudio se&#13;
seiiala que el "tipo acertado" de exportaciones de capital (a]. estilo del&#13;
Jap6n) es probable que tenga una repercusi6n mucho mas favorable en la&#13;
dinamica de la ventaja comparativa que el "tipo desacertado" de importa-&#13;
ciones de mano de obra (al estilo de Europa).&#13;

AcknowLedgments&#13;
The present essay contains some thoughts concerning the relationship&#13;
between population growth and international economic relations. This is&#13;
obviously a very complex topic which our short essay can only pretend to touch&#13;
on. We have found that the factor endowment theory of international trade&#13;
provides a useful framework for the analysis of the problem at hand. This&#13;
theory is appealing for the study of the international economic impacts of&#13;
population growth since it directly relates trade and factor movements to the&#13;
supply of factors of production. Hosts of writers have recently emphasized&#13;
that it is necessary to go beyond the factor endowment explanation of&#13;
comparative advantage. We share their views on the need to recognize the&#13;
importance of other elements, such as technological differences, scale&#13;
economies, and market imperfections, in shaping trade patterns. Yet, as a&#13;
first approximation, we will disregard these elements and focus almost&#13;
exclusively on factor endowments. Therefore, ours must be considered as a&#13;
ceteris paribus analysis of the issues.&#13;

I. Introduction&#13;
During the past quarter-century, world population dynamics has&#13;
undergone significant changes. Besi-des a spectacular acceleration in the&#13;
overall growth rate, the new pattern has been characterized bv sharp&#13;
differences between developing and industrialized nations. This has resulted&#13;
in a demographic gap between these nations which, by all accounts, will&#13;
continue to widen in thte forseeable future. The magnitude of the gap is&#13;
depicited in Figure 1.1 for total and working-age (20-59) population.    In the&#13;
forty year span between 1960 and 2000, the gap for total popu:Lation is&#13;
expected to grow from 1.1 billion to 3.6 billion. At the same time, the gap&#13;
for the population of working age is expected to increase from 0.4 billion to&#13;
1.7 billion.&#13;

In the recent past, great intellectual efforts have been devoted&#13;
to the study of the interaction between population dynamics and income&#13;
growth. Despite much controversy, it is usually accepted that rapid&#13;
population growth--because of its negative impact on physical and human&#13;
capital accumulation--has slowed down the rate of economic progress in&#13;
developing countries. Whatever the precise nature of the interaction, it:&#13;
remains that the growing demographic disparity has been accompanied by&#13;
enormous income differentials between developing and industrialized&#13;
countries. Given the present difference in income levels, the absolute gap in&#13;
terms of per capita income will continue to widen for some time, even if&#13;
average incomes grow faster in developing than in industrialized countries.&#13;
Our concern here is with the relationship between the demographic and&#13;
income trends described earlier and international economic interactions of&#13;
developing and industrialized nations. The purpose of this paper can be&#13;
viewed under alternative interpretations. On the one hand, it can be&#13;
interpreted as an investigation into the pattern of international economic&#13;
interactions that could result from the predicted widening demographic and&#13;
income gaps. Alternatively, it can be viewed as examining whether such&#13;
interactions between developing and industralized countries could accommodate&#13;
these gaps. In other words: given that rapid population growth in developing&#13;
countries has a detrimental effect on economic progress, can the developing&#13;
countries be rescued from this outcome by reinforcing their international&#13;
economic relations with industrialized countries. 1/&#13;
There are two channels the international system could, in principle,&#13;
rely upon\to accommodate the effects of uneven population growth rates: trade&#13;
and factor movements. Therefore, our analysis will deal with the relationship&#13;
between widening demographic and income gaps and trade, capital movements, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
international migration.   Moreover, we will examine whether there is a trade&#13;
off between trade and factor movements, and between capital movements and&#13;
international migratio:n.&#13;
A basic tenet of our study will be that changes in factor endowments&#13;
produce changes in factor costs. Accordingly, the demographic trends&#13;
described earlier will not only increase the relative labor abundance of&#13;
developing countries but also decrease the relative price of Labor in these&#13;
countries. It is via such change in the relative prices of production factors&#13;
that we plan to investigate the possibility for trade or factor movements to&#13;
accommodate the widening population and labor force gaps between developing&#13;
and industrialized countries. This will be done by combining economic theory&#13;
and historical evidence on trade and factor movements.&#13;
II. Trade&#13;
In this chapter we examine the interrelationship between population&#13;
growth and international trade. Our focus is on the following question: Can&#13;
developing countries accommodate their rapid growth of population and labor&#13;
force by means of rapid export growth? This is obviously a supply question&#13;
which relates to the possibility that lower labor costs, due to an increase in&#13;
the relative labor abundance, wouLd render developing countries more&#13;
competitive on world markets. Throughout this chapter, we will. ignore the&#13;
demand side of the relationship between demographics and trad.e which consists&#13;
of investigating the effect of population growth on developing country&#13;
imports, mostly for food products.    The chapter is divided into three&#13;
sections. In the first one we review historical trends relat:ing to the&#13;
relative importance and pattern of trade during the nineteenth and twentieth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
centuries. The second section examines the recent export record of developing&#13;
countries and attempts to relate it with certain characteristics of these&#13;
economies. The final section attempts to draw some perspectives for the&#13;
future of the issue at hand.&#13;
Some Historical Perspectives on Trade&#13;
According to Kuznets (1967), the ratio of world trade to world&#13;
product has steadily increased throughout the nineteeth century. From 3&#13;
percent in 1800, it reached 33 percent in 1913. Thereafter, the depression of&#13;
the 1930s and World War II considerably reduced the relative importance of&#13;
world trade, which reached its lowest since 1913 in the early 1950s. Since&#13;
then it has, again, steadily increased to 22 percent in 1963 and, further, to&#13;
30 percent in 1980. 2/ Thus it took about 30 years after World War II for&#13;
world trade to regain its pre-World War I importance.&#13;
Obviously, the ratio of trade to GNP varies considerably across&#13;
countries. Kuznets, and several other economists after him, have shown in&#13;
cross country studies that this ratio varies inversely with the absolute size&#13;
of GNP. However, once the effect of size is controlled for, it is found that&#13;
the ratio of trade to GNP increases with the level of GNP per capita. As&#13;
Little (1982) indicates, contrary to a common misconception, industrialized&#13;
countries are more trade-dependent than developing countries.&#13;
The works by Kuznets (1967) and Lewis (1981) indicate that, until&#13;
recently, primary products accounted for most of world commodity trade.&#13;
Between 1850 and 1937, the share of manufactures in world trade (measured at&#13;
current prices) oscillated between 36 and 39 percent. After World War II,&#13;
this share started to increase steadily, reaching 50 percent in 1960 and 61&#13;
percent in 1973. Thereafter, there was a decrease due to the oil price&#13;
increase. In 1980 the share of manufactures in total trade was 55 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

For the industrialized countries, manufactures accounted in 1980 for&#13;
73 percent of total exports and 51 percent of total imports. For developing&#13;
countries as a whole, manufactures represented 19 percent of exports and 62&#13;
percent of imports; if -raditional oil exporters are excluded, the respective&#13;
figures are 39 and 57 percent.&#13;
According to Kuznets (1967), the distribution of world commodity&#13;
trade (measured at current prices) between developing and industrialize!d&#13;
countries has changed relatively little from the 1870s to the L960s.&#13;
Industrialized countries have consistently accounted for about 70 percent of&#13;
world trade. Flows among industrialized countries have oscillated between 45&#13;
and 50 percent of world trade, while flows among developing countries have&#13;
increased their relative importance from 4 to 8 percent; trade between&#13;
developing and industrialized countries has remained at around 45 percent of&#13;
total trade. More recent figures indicate that similar proportions have&#13;
continued to prevail throughout the 1970s.&#13;
Trade and Changes in Factor Endowments&#13;
The demographic trends described in the introduction imply that the&#13;
relative labor abundance of developing countries is increasing and, therefore,&#13;
that the relative price of labor should be decreasing in these countries.&#13;
(The term "labor" used here refers to unskilled workers only.) What is the&#13;
consequence of this trend on developing country exports? Can a reduction in&#13;
the relative cost of urnskilled labor give rise to an increase in exports by&#13;
developing countries?&#13;
In order to answer these questions, one needs first to distinguish&#13;
between primary and manufactured products.    As far as primary products are&#13;
concerned, it is well known that export prospects for developing countries&#13;
depend more on growth of world demand than on the supply conditions which&#13;
prevail in these countries.   On the other hand, there seems to be a consensus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
among economists that developing country export growth for manufactured&#13;
products is based mostly on their relative competitive position. 3/&#13;
Accordingly, in the remainder of this chapter, we will focus our attention on&#13;
manufactured products which, alone, seem to have the potential for export&#13;
growth via a shift in supply conditions, such as a reduction in the relative&#13;
cost of (unskilled) labor.&#13;
During the past two decades, developing countries considered as a&#13;
group have made dramatic gains in manufactures exports. This has resulted in&#13;
the doubling of the share of manufactures in total developing country exports&#13;
from 10 percent in 1960 to 20 percent in 1980. If one excludes nonfuel&#13;
products, the corresponding figures are 13 and 44 percent, respectively.&#13;
However, developing countries are far from being a homogenous group:&#13;
performance in manufactures exports varies greatly across individual&#13;
countries. It is clear that some countries have been able to exploit their&#13;
relative advantage afforded by low costs for unskilled labor, while others&#13;
have not. We will now attempt to identify individual country characteristics&#13;
associated with manufactures export performance. For the purpose of this&#13;
study, we define export performance of a country as the value of manufactures&#13;
exports in 1980 divided by the corresponding value in 1962. 4/ The results of&#13;
this computation are reported in Table 2.1 (column 3) where countries (all&#13;
those for which data were available) have been arranged by ascending order&#13;
according to the value of manufactures exports in 1962.&#13;
There are, obviously, many factors which contribute to manufactures&#13;
export performance in developing countries. Rather than attempting to&#13;
quantify the importance of several such factors, we will examine only one&#13;
possible explanatory variable which we feel is particularly important. Having&#13;
estimated the contribution of this variable, we will then examine what other&#13;
factors might play an important role in shaping export performance.&#13;

There is widespread agreement that the accumulation of human and&#13;
physical capital is a key factor in the process of economic development. In&#13;
particuLar, Krueger (1968) found that differences in human capital endowments&#13;
contribute more than any other factor to income differences across&#13;
countries. Given that data on physical capital are not readily available for&#13;
most of the countries in our sample, we have only attempted to evaluate the&#13;
effect of human capital accumulation on export performance. This was done by&#13;
regressing the measure of export performance defined earlier on an index of&#13;
human capital, controlling for the value of manufactures exports in 1962.&#13;
Among the possible measures of human capital, it was felt that the adult&#13;
literacy rate for 1970 (a mid-point between 1962 and 1980) was the best&#13;
choice. 5/ The reason for including the value of manufactures exports at the&#13;
beginning of the period as an explanatory variable is that, for a given level&#13;
of human capital in 1970, countries with low initial exports can more easily&#13;
improve their relative position than established exporters.&#13;
The results of the regression analysis for the sub-sample of&#13;
forty-two countries for which data on Literacy were available are as follows:&#13;
log (ME 8 /ME )62  -0.073 + 1.000 Log (LR 70)   0.195 log (ME 62     R2=    4&#13;
g  80  62)  (1.018)  (0.281)            (0.120)        62    R2= D.246&#13;
where ME is the value of manufactures exports, LR is the adult literacy rate,&#13;
and the values in parentheses are the standard errors of the coefficients.&#13;
There are two implications from these results. First, the coefficient of the&#13;
human capital variable is strongly significant. Developing countries which&#13;
had accumulated sizeable human capitaL by 1970 have tended to perform better&#13;
than others in manufactures exports. This result is confirmed by splitting&#13;
the forty-two countries into a group of twenty-one high performers and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9-&#13;
twenty-one tow performers. Among the twenty-one countries beLonging t:o the&#13;
first group, nineteen had a high literacy rate in 1970 (over 50 percent) and&#13;
only two, Tunisia and the Ivory Cost, had a low one (below 50 percent). 6/ On&#13;
the other hand, among the twenty-one Low performers, seven had a high and&#13;
fourteen had a low literacy rate.    Thus, the accumulation of human capital&#13;
appears to be much more a necessary than a sufficient condition for high&#13;
manufactures export performance. Second, human capital and the other&#13;
independent variable of the model only explain 25 percent of cross-country&#13;
variations in export performance. Thus, although human capital appears to be&#13;
an important explanatory variable, several other factors are, undoubtedly,&#13;
missing in the regression analysis.&#13;
In order to gain some insight on missing explanatory variables, we&#13;
have examined the residuals of the regression. Using two standard deviations&#13;
as the cutting line, we find that thirteen residuals lie outside the usual&#13;
bounds, six on the positive side and seven on the negative side. The six&#13;
countries for which the actual export performance value much exceeds the&#13;
fitted value are:   Brazil, Turkey, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Indonesia, and The&#13;
Republic of Korea.   The seven countries with a fitted value mach exceeding the&#13;
observed value are: Algeria, Bolivia, Ethiopia, Paraguay, Venezuela,&#13;
Madagascar, and Papua New Guinea. One factor which differs between the two&#13;
country groups is trade policy. On the whole, overachievers in terms of&#13;
export performance have been countries with outward-oriented trade policies&#13;
(especially during the 1970s), while underachievers have tended to adopt&#13;
inward-looking policies. Other economic, social, or political factors have,&#13;
no doubt, aLso pLayed a role in determining the degree of export success.&#13;
The conclusion which emerges from the regression analysis is that the&#13;
accumulation of human capital appears to be a necessary condition for success&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
in exporting manufactured products. Had the data been available, it would&#13;
probably have shown that the accumulation of physical capital is another key&#13;
factor. What this means is that only in countries enjoying sufficient&#13;
relative (human and, probably, physical) capital endowments could one expect a&#13;
change in supply conditions (other than the accumulation of capital) to have&#13;
an impact on manufactures exports. Thus in relatively capital abundant, high&#13;
income developing countries, the fact that population and labor force are&#13;
often growing relatively rapidly compared to industrialized countries should&#13;
not determine whether or not they export manufactures, but rather it should&#13;
affect the extent and product composition of these exports. On the other&#13;
hand, in low-income, capital-poor countries, rapid population and labor force&#13;
growth (by reducing the possibility for human and physical capital&#13;
accumulation) actually compromises the opportunity to participate in the&#13;
expansion of manufactures exports. For these countries, there is little or no&#13;
possibility for export growth to accommodate their rapid population growth.&#13;
For successful manufactures exporters, international differences in&#13;
relative rates of accumulation for the various factors of production can be&#13;
expected to modify their pattern of trade because of the induced changes in&#13;
factor prices. Several recent empirical studies tend to confirm this&#13;
prediction. The case of Japan is particularly illuminating. In the span of&#13;
only thirty years, this country has emerged from the group of developing&#13;
countries to become one of the world's most industrialized nations. From a&#13;
per capita GNP level lower than that of Brazil, Chile, and Malaysia in 11952,&#13;
Japan is now on equal footing with most of the other OECD countries. 7/&#13;
Simultaneously to this rapid growth of income, Japan has experienced a deep&#13;
transformation in her factor endowment position. Still considered a labor&#13;
abundant country in the 1950s, rapid (physical and human) capital accumuLation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and a drastic reduction in population growth led to "labor shortages" during&#13;
the following decade. "Cheap labor" soon became a thing of the past. 8/&#13;
In a recent study, Peter Heller (1976) has investigated whether&#13;
Japan's shift in factor endowments toward a capital abundant position has&#13;
resulted in a change in her trade pattern as predicted by theory. With the&#13;
help of input-output coefficients, Heller has computed the direct and indirect&#13;
requirements for labor, capital and skilled labor associated with Japan's&#13;
trade structure. His results indicate that between 1955 and 1968 the capital&#13;
and skill intensity of her exports have greatly increased. 9/ This leads him&#13;
to conclude that the change in Japan's factor endowment has strongly altered&#13;
the composition of her exports toward capital and skill intensive sectors.&#13;
The relationship between the changing pattern of comparative&#13;
advantage and the accumulation of factors of production has been further&#13;
explored by Balassa (1979) in a cross-section study covering thirty-six&#13;
countries. Like Heller (1976) this study distinguishes three factors: labor,&#13;
physical capital and human capital. Balassa uses a two stage procedure. In&#13;
the first stage, regression equations are estimated, separately for each&#13;
country, relating a measure of export performance in nearly 200 product&#13;
categories to their physical and human capital intensity. The second stage&#13;
involves regressing the estimated coefficients from the previous stage on&#13;
country characteristics refLecting factor endowments.&#13;
Balassa finds that intercountry differences in the pattern of exports&#13;
can be largely explained by differences in physical and human capital&#13;
abundance. He concludes that this result supports a 'stages' approach to&#13;
comparative advantage, according to which the accumulation of physical and&#13;
human capital leads to changes in the structure of exports. Implicit here is&#13;
the fact that the abuncdance and accumulation of capial are measured relative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
to labor which, in turn, is directly linked to population. Balassa&#13;
illustrates his approach with the case of Japan, which has lost its&#13;
comparative advantage in certain products to the newly industrializing&#13;
countries (NICs). He predicts that, in turn, these countries might be&#13;
supplanted by countries at lower levels of relative capital accumulation for&#13;
unskilled labor intensive products.&#13;
A recent study by Havrylyshyn and Alikhani (1982) seems to confirm&#13;
Balassa's prediction. The authors have investigated the exports during the&#13;
seventies of non-NIC developing countries which have emerged as new exporting&#13;
countries (NECs). They find that the NECs are basing their rapid export&#13;
expansion on similar products as did the NICs earlier on. The NECs, which are&#13;
generally more labor abundant than the NICs, tend to have a comparative&#13;
advantage in unskilled labor intensive products. On the other hand, as a&#13;
result of their capital accumulation, the NICs have tended to shift their&#13;
comparative advantage toward more capital and skill intensive commodities.&#13;
Future Prospects&#13;
The previous sections provide the historical and analytical&#13;
background for assessing whether world trade can accommodate the widening&#13;
demographic gap between developing and industrialized nations. This section&#13;
concludes that, for developing countries in general, the detrimental effects&#13;
of rapid population growth cannot be mitigated by increased exports.&#13;
Nevertheless, for certain developing countries that have already managed to&#13;
accumulate sizeable stocks of human and physical capital, fuller participation&#13;
in world trade can contribute toward absorbing relatively rapid population&#13;
increases without compromising their chances for economic progress.&#13;
Despite a prolonged duration, the current recession of the world&#13;
economy has not significantly affected the ratio of world trade to world&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
product. Between 1980 and 1982, this ratio has decreased by merely one&#13;
percentage point, down to 29 percent. During the same period, the reLative&#13;
importance of manufactures in world trade has continued to increase. On the&#13;
whole, the share of developing countries in world manufactures exports has&#13;
also continued to rise.&#13;
During the decade ahead, world trade can be expected to grow slower&#13;
than before the mid-1970s, but its importance relative to world product: should&#13;
remain around 30 percent. For deveLoping countries taken as a whole, trade&#13;
should continue to grow faster than GNP and at a more rapid rate than in&#13;
industrialized countries. At the same time, there will remain great&#13;
disparities in export performance among these countries.&#13;
In low income countries, especially in Africa, the lack of human and&#13;
physical capital will continue to restrain the growth of manufactured product&#13;
exports. This situation can be expected to further worsen due to the rapid&#13;
growth of population. Thus for these countries there is little hope for&#13;
exports to accommodate their population pressures.&#13;
The situation in other developing countries is somewhat different.&#13;
In these countries, there is sufficient human and physical capital to permit a&#13;
rapid expansion of manufactures exports. For these countries, the successful&#13;
absorption of new entrants into the labor force seems to be possible provided&#13;
an appropriate economic environment exists. According to a recent study on&#13;
trade and employment in developing countries, this would imply a combination&#13;
of an outward-oriented trade strategy and a realignment in factor market&#13;
incentives. Within this framework, an export strategy based on labor&#13;
intensive products would relieve these countries from (part of) their&#13;
demographic pressures. 10/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
The possibility for exports from developing countries to absorb some&#13;
of the new labor force entrants crucially depends upon their access to foreign&#13;
markets, especially in the industrialized countries, which are their main&#13;
customers. Despite the rise in protectionist pressures in industrialized&#13;
countries in recent years, it seems that market penetration by developing&#13;
countries for manufactured products has continued to increase, albeit at a&#13;
reduced pace. Nevertheless, there is some fear that, as large developing&#13;
countries begin to follow the strategy of labor intensive exports adopted&#13;
earlier by smaller countries, they "would encounter sharp protective&#13;
resistance to the resulting flood of export" [Cline 19821. There are several&#13;
reasons why this gloomy outcome might not materialize. First, large countries&#13;
tend to have large domestic markets and, hence, relatively low export to&#13;
production ratios. For developing countries, this relationship is less&#13;
straightforward as large countries (in terms of population, for instance)&#13;
might have relatively small domestic markets due to low per capita incomes.&#13;
In this case, exports might be critical for the successful establishment of&#13;
certain manufactured products, unless the domestic market is expanded--for&#13;
instance by improving conditions in the agricultural sector. Second,&#13;
industrialized countries are not the only foreign market for manufactures&#13;
exports from developing countries. On the contrary, developing countries&#13;
themselves account for a sizeable share (around 30 percent) of those exports,&#13;
and it might be expected to increase in the future along with income gains.&#13;
Third, if one accepts the "stages" approach to comparative advantage outlined&#13;
earlier, there will be room for new entrants (even large ones) in the market&#13;
for labor intensive exports. As the present dominant countries (that is, the&#13;
Southeast Asian NICs) accumulate further human and physical capital, they can&#13;
be expected to lose their comparative advantage in labor intensive products in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
favor of countries with relatively less capital endowments. Finally, it is&#13;
important to note that the possibility for countries to successfully enter the&#13;
market for labor intensive products and supplant the present dominant nations&#13;
depends not only upon their own policies but also upon the policies of&#13;
industrialized countries. In the case of textiles, for instance, it has been&#13;
noted that the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) protects not only producers in&#13;
industrialized countries; but also the present leading developing country&#13;
suppliers for whom rapi(I wage increases threaten the competitiveness of&#13;
textiles exports. ll/&#13;
III. Factor Movements&#13;
In the previous chapter we have seen how changes in factor endowments&#13;
(particularly populationi growth) tend to affect the pattern of trade.&#13;
Throughout our analysis, we have left aside the possibility of international&#13;
factor movements. Here we will adopt: the opposite approach and, focus entirely&#13;
on capital and labor movements across countries. We will take for granted&#13;
differences in factor prices across countries and examine their effects on&#13;
factor movements as well as the choice between alternative formis of&#13;
international factor mobility. Our piecemeal procedure obviously serves a&#13;
purely academic purpose since trade and factor movements influence each other&#13;
in a very direct fashion. A more realistic approach integrating trade and&#13;
factor mobility will, nevertheless, have to await the next chapter.&#13;
As we have seen earlier, the Heckscher-Ohlin theory predicts a&#13;
negative correlation between the price and supply of factors of production.&#13;
Ceteris paribus, the reward of a factor that is relatively abundant in a&#13;
particular country will tend to be relatively low in that country. Countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
with different factor endowments will therefore tend to have different factor&#13;
rewards. Abstracting from trade, international factor price different;ials can&#13;
be expected to induce international factor movements. Since, in fact, factors&#13;
of production are only partially mobile, there will be a tendency for the more&#13;
mobile one to leave low reward places and go to high reward places where it is&#13;
in short supply. 12/ And indeed, labor has usually moved from poor to rich&#13;
capital or natural resource countries while capital has moved toward either&#13;
labor or natural resource rich countries.&#13;
Our enquiry about the effects of population growth on factor&#13;
movements between developing and industrialized countries begins with a review&#13;
of the immigration of labor to the United States. We will then discuss the&#13;
policy of labor import of European countries which will be contrasted with&#13;
Japan's policy of capital export.&#13;
The Case of the United States&#13;
In this section we review the immigration experience of the United&#13;
States. We begin with a brief historical description and then discuss the&#13;
economic effects of this migration.&#13;
A. From Colonial Times to the 1920s&#13;
During the three centuries that followed Columbus' discovery of&#13;
America, immigration to the continent remained a rare occurrence. By 1800&#13;
there were only four million inhabitants of European origin in the United&#13;
States. 13/ During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries more tllan 60&#13;
million Europeans left their countries for overseas destinations, mostly in&#13;
the direction of the United States. The major factors behind this&#13;
unprecedented migration are (i) Europe's population explosion caused mainly&#13;
by declining death rates; (ii) the Industrial Revolution, which initially&#13;
brought rising inequality and pauperisation of certain groups; (iii) untapped&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
natural resources overseas; and (iv) the invention of the steamship, which&#13;
made its first Atlantic journey in 1819. 14/ With reduced transportation&#13;
costs, migration proceeded on the basis of large disparities in wages and&#13;
rents between the two con,tinents created in part by the large supply of labor&#13;
(the mobile factor) in Europe and the enormous availability of good arabLe&#13;
land (the immobile factor) in the United States. 15/&#13;
Around 1880 a break occurred in the pattern of immigration. As the&#13;
economic conditions and population pressure improved in Northern and Western&#13;
Europe, the new migrants came more and more from Southern and Eastern European&#13;
countries. At the same time, the industrialization process of the American&#13;
economy changed the destination of migrants from rural to urban settlements.&#13;
B. After the 1920s' Quotas&#13;
Until after Worl]d War I, admission of Europeans into the United&#13;
States was essentially unrestricted. 16/ Adverse economic conditions and fear&#13;
of a change in the ethnic composition of the population led, in the early&#13;
1920s, to the imposition of quotas limiting the number and national origin of&#13;
migrants.&#13;
One of the consequences of the curtailment of European migration was&#13;
the first large-scale wave of Mexican labor into the United States. Since&#13;
then, the rapid Mexican population growth, the wide wage disparity, the active&#13;
recruitment by private United States employers, and the easiness of crossing&#13;
the border have all combined to produce a massive flow of legal and mostly&#13;
illegal migrants from Mexico. 17/ Recently, a sizeable number of undocumented&#13;
workers from other Latin American and Caribbean countries have also migrated&#13;
to the United States.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
C. Economic effects&#13;
There has always been a battle in the Unit'ed States between opponents&#13;
and proponents of immigration barriers. Although philosophical considerations&#13;
have no doubt played a role, the split has been mainly between gainers and&#13;
losers--or, at least, between those perceiving themselves as such--from new&#13;
labor inflows. Economists have participated in the debate by attempting to&#13;
evaluate the economic effects of migration. They distinguish between static&#13;
and dynamic effects.&#13;
The major static effect concerns the distribution of income among the&#13;
various factors of production. With a static framework, this issue hinges&#13;
essentially on whether migrants are substitutes for or complements to other&#13;
factors. The theoretical argument has generally been that labor loses and&#13;
capital gains from increased labor migration. In a recent study, J. B.&#13;
Grossman (1982) has examined the degree of substitutabiLity between migrant&#13;
workers and other factors in the context of the United States economy. Using&#13;
cross-section data for 1970, she estimates a translog production functiorn from&#13;
which a measure of factor substitutability can be derived. Her results&#13;
indicate that foreign-born workers are complementary with capital but&#13;
substitutes for native workers with either native or foreign-born parents.&#13;
Therefore an inflow of immigrants increases the return to capital and&#13;
decreases wages (alternatively it might increase unemployment in case of&#13;
downwardly inflexible wages) as theoretically predicted. If all wages are&#13;
flexible, Grossman estimates that a 10 percent increase in the number of&#13;
immigrants employed in the United States would reduce wages of natives by I&#13;
percent and of other immigrants by more than 2 percent; the return to capital&#13;
would increase by more than 4 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
The distributional impact of immigration has also been examined by&#13;
Williamson (1980) in a study of the period between the 1830s and the 1960s.&#13;
The core of the study is a general equilibrium model with three sectors&#13;
(agriculture, industry and services) and four factors of production (land,&#13;
capital, unskilled labor, and skilled labor). SimuLations of the model&#13;
produce the expected negative relationship between migration and wages ol-&#13;
competing (unskilled) labor. Williamson's results indicate, however, that&#13;
nigration has had a much smaller impact on American income distribution than&#13;
farmland growth (during the 19th century), capital accumulation, and&#13;
technological progress.   A counter-factual simulation pegging these three&#13;
factors at their historical levels and allowing (legal) migration between 1929&#13;
and 1966 to continue at its pre quotas rate indicates that real wage growth&#13;
among the unskilled would have been 20 percent below its historical level..&#13;
The static analysis might have either overstated or und,erestimated&#13;
the impact of immigration on income distribution (or on any other&#13;
nagnitude). There might in fact be dynamic effects induced by the impact of&#13;
migration on factors such as capital accumulation and technological progress,&#13;
which were previously exogenous. KindLeberger (1967) has argued that mass&#13;
immigration in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century has meant that&#13;
"wage rates for common labor were held down, profits were maintained, and&#13;
growth through high rates of investment proceeded." This view is also shared&#13;
by Williamson (1980), who incorporates it into his model. As fa-r as&#13;
technological progress is concerned, Habakkuk's (1962) thesis is that the&#13;
relative scarcity of labbr in the United States in the nineteenth century has&#13;
stimulated labor-saving innovation. This would imply that mass immigration&#13;
has reduced the labor saving bias of Anerican technological prog-ress. More&#13;
recently, Simon (1980) has argued that the increase in the rate of total&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
factor productivity growth is the most important long-run effect of&#13;
immigration. His argument rests essentially upon greater economies of&#13;
scale. As usual, dynamic effects are difficult to document and highly&#13;
speculative. In fact, we will see in the next section that some of the above&#13;
arguments are far from being universally shared. In any event, as we have&#13;
already noted, dynamic effects mostly lie beyond the scope of this paper.&#13;
The Case of Europe&#13;
A. The "Guestworker" Program&#13;
Historically, Western Europe has been, on balance, a Land of&#13;
emigration. This trend was reversed in the early 1960s when its rapidly&#13;
growing economy started to welcome foreign workers. The main feature of this&#13;
new phenomenon has been the policy pursued by the countries of immigration.&#13;
In most of them, guestworker programs were set up that systematically&#13;
recruited foreign workers on a temporary basis in order to fill particular&#13;
jobs for which there was a "shortage" of domestic workers. After 1960, more&#13;
than 20 million foreigners, almost all from developing Mediterranean&#13;
countries, had worked or lived in Western Europe for at least some time. By&#13;
1973, about 7 million alien workers (accompanied by about as many dependents)&#13;
accounted for more than 10 percent of Europe's labor force. Since then the&#13;
recession has halted guestworker programs, but, despite voluntary and&#13;
involuntary departures, the number of migrant workers has not decreased by&#13;
more than 20 percent compared to its 1973 peak level (the number of dependents&#13;
has probably, in fact, increased).&#13;
Several factors characterize contemporary European migration. First,&#13;
except for intra-EEC labor movements (mostly from Italy), international&#13;
migration is regulated by a system of labor permits granted by a governmental&#13;
agency. Second, employers in the countries of immigration have actively&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
recruited foreign workers either directly or through official channels.&#13;
(Until the mid 1970s Germany maintained official recruiting off-ices in major&#13;
source countries.)   In Eact, labor permits have usually been granted to&#13;
employers who then have recruited immigrants. Third, differentials in&#13;
expected earnings between Western Europe and the Mediterranean countries and&#13;
population pressures in these countries have been such that labor permits have&#13;
constituted an actual binding constraint on immigration. Thus it can be said&#13;
that Western European countries have faced an almost unlimited supply of&#13;
workers from the Mediterranean Basin at the going wages.&#13;
B.  Economic Effects.&#13;
Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, the major rationale behind the&#13;
immigration policy was the notion of "labor shortage." In economic terms, a&#13;
shortage is the sign of a disequilibrium which requires an adjustment. This&#13;
adjustment can be in terms of either a quantity or a price change. A policy&#13;
of labor immigration is a quantity adjustment aimed at relieving a labor&#13;
shortage which prevails at a given wage. On the other hand, a price&#13;
adjustment would imply increasing the wage rate. 18/ Obviously, in practice&#13;
the acutal adjustment is a combination of both price and quantity&#13;
adjustments. These two forms of adjustment have different static (income&#13;
distribution) and dynamic (accumulation and technological progress) effects.&#13;
The distributionaL effect of immigration observed earLier for the&#13;
United States seems to hold also in the European case. Several authors have&#13;
found that an increase in the employment of foreign workers has a dampening&#13;
effect on money wages. See, for instance, Bain and Pauga (1972) and Garbers&#13;
and Blankart (1973).&#13;
The discussion of the dynamic effects of immigration is much more&#13;
controverted. Most economists have accepted Kindleberger's (1967) argument,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
according to which immigration leads to lower wages, higher profits, and hence&#13;
higher investment. On the other hand, Mishan and Needleman (1966) have argued&#13;
that the arrival of new immigrants induces social capital expenditures which&#13;
reduce the capital available for industrial investment and may even cause a&#13;
decline in the absolute industrial capital stock. The latter view has been&#13;
rejected by Castles and Kosack (1973) and others. 19/ As far as technological&#13;
progress is concerned, no one seems to have argued, as did Simon (1980), that&#13;
European immigration has had a beneficial effect via greater economies of&#13;
scale. On the other hand, several economists from the Kiel Institute for&#13;
World Economy--for example, Hiemenz and Schatz (1979)--have argued that, by&#13;
reducing the scarcity of labor, immigration has reduced the rate of labor&#13;
saving innovation of the German economy. A wage adjustment would probably&#13;
have had the opposite result.&#13;
The Case of Japan&#13;
A.  The "Invest Abroad" Program&#13;
Shortly after European countries, Japan "began to experience labor&#13;
shortages in the mid-1960s" (Ozawa 1979a, p. 80). Japan and Europe, both&#13;
threatened with a slowdown of economic growth by the exhaustion of their labor&#13;
surplus, reacted in almost opposite fashions. While authorities in Germany&#13;
and elsewhere were organizing guestworker programs and setting up labor&#13;
recruiting offices in Mediterranean countries, the Japanese government was&#13;
mounting a large scale "invest abroad" program and establishing offices in&#13;
developing countries in order to organize the search of investment&#13;
opportunities.&#13;
Obviously, it is much more likely that Europe's import of labor was&#13;
motivated by labor shortages than is the case for Japan's export of capital.&#13;
Yet, there seems to be a consensus that the change in this country's relative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
resource endowments was indeed a major incentive for investing abroad en&#13;
masse, at least in the manufacturing sector. As Ozawa (1979b) writes: "As a&#13;
way to escape from the strained labor market at home Japanese manufacturers&#13;
began to look for labor in such neighboring countries as Hong Kong, Singapore,&#13;
South Korea, and Taiwan." (p.80) 20/&#13;
Historically, outward direct investment by Japanese firms have been&#13;
s-trictly controlled. Towa.rd the end of the 1960s various measures were taken&#13;
to progressively encourage overseas investments. In principle, these were&#13;
completely liberalized in 1972. As a result of such measures, Japan's direct&#13;
'oreign investments experienced an exceptionally rapid growth. F'rom only $1.5&#13;
billion for the period 1951-67, the cumulative value of overseas investments&#13;
approved by the government went to $15.9 billion by 1976 and reached $36.5&#13;
billion by 1980.   Manufacturing investments, which represent about 40 percent&#13;
of the total, are concentrated in developing countries, particularly in&#13;
Asia.&#13;
B. Economic effects&#13;
This author is not aware of any study of the effect of outward direct&#13;
investments on Japan's income distribution. It seems likely that, ceteris&#13;
paribus, they have had the same qualitative effect on wages and capital&#13;
rentals as an inflow of additional labor. The dynamic effects are much more&#13;
difficult to predict at this stage. In our next chapter we will, come back to&#13;
this issue when the effects of factor mobility on the international structure&#13;
of production will be taken into account.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
Whether spontaneous or organized, factor movements have usually&#13;
occurred in response to factor price differentials, themselves related, at&#13;
least in part, to differences in factor endowments. In the examples we have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
reviewed earlier, labor has moved from relatively labor abundant countries&#13;
(Europe in the nineteenth century, Mexico and Mediterranean countries in the&#13;
recent past) to countries relatively well endowed with either natural&#13;
resources (America in the nineteenth century) or capital (contemporary America&#13;
and Western Europe). 21/ Capital has usually gone in the opposite direction,&#13;
as in the case of Japan.&#13;
During the twentieth century, potential factor movements have usually&#13;
been severely controlled by national policies. Especially in the case of&#13;
labor migration, it is the rich industrialized nations that have erected&#13;
barriers against the citizens from poor developing countries. Only when the&#13;
former found it advantageous (like Europe in the 1960s and early 1970s or the&#13;
United States when it recruited Mexican labor from 1943 to 1965 under the&#13;
bracero program) was it claimed that "migration, like mercy, blesses him that&#13;
gives and him that takes" (Kindleberger 1967, p. 202).&#13;
IV. Population Growth, Trade, and Factor Mobility&#13;
Ceteris paribus, countries in which the rate of population growth is&#13;
high compared with the accumulation rates of other factors will tend to have&#13;
low wages relative to the return of the other factors. As we have seen in the&#13;
previous two chapters, such countries will accordingly tend to (i) export&#13;
products that use labor relatively intensively and import products that use&#13;
labor relatively unintensively; and/or (ii) export labor and/or import other&#13;
factors. Our previous discussion has indicated that each of these&#13;
alternatives has actually occurred, but so far we have analyzed them as if&#13;
they were independent of one another. In this chapter we will attempt tco&#13;
study their interrelationship.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Despite the existence of large international flows of labor and&#13;
capital during their era, most nineteenth century exponents of ini:ernational&#13;
trade theory postulated international immobility (and complete inLernal&#13;
mtobility) for all factors of production. The celebrated 1919 paper by Eli&#13;
Feckscher represents probably the first major departure from the previous&#13;
crthodoxy and effort at integrating trade and international factor mobility.&#13;
One of Heckscher's contributions was to show that, under certain conditions,&#13;
commodity trade alone leads to full factor price equalization, which implies&#13;
t:he elimination of the incentive or need for factor mobility.&#13;
The Factor Price Equalization Theorem formally established by Lerner&#13;
(1953) and Samuelson (1943) for the two-good, two-factor, two-country case&#13;
3hows that commodity price equalization through trade leads to full&#13;
equalization of the prices of the (assumed) completely immobile factors if (a)&#13;
countries have identical technologies, (b) countries are incompletely&#13;
specialized, and (c) factor intensity reversals are excluded (that is,&#13;
commodities can be unambiguously classified in terms of factor intensity).&#13;
Attempts at generalizing the Theorem to many goods and many factors have&#13;
produced mixed results. In particular, Samuelson (1953) has shown that full&#13;
factor price equalization cannot occur if the number of factor exceeds the&#13;
number of goods, but partial equalization is not excluded.&#13;
In reality, factor prices are obviously far from being equalized&#13;
internationally. One possible argument is simply that free trade does not in&#13;
fact prevail and therefore that commodity prices are not equalized. On the&#13;
other hand, many authors have rejected the usefulness of the Factor Price&#13;
Equalization Theorem on :he ground that its assumptions are unrealistic.&#13;
These assumptions require not only internationally identical technologies but&#13;
also that actual techniques of production are everywhere the sarne. However,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
with substantial differences in factor endowments, countries will specialize&#13;
their production and the techniques of production will necessarily differ&#13;
across countries. Heckscher himself had noted this possibility and indicated&#13;
that, in fact, it provided the explanation for the nineteenth century&#13;
emigration from Europe to America:&#13;
The situation of the United States in the period before&#13;
the large European immigration may be considered once&#13;
again ... The country had enormous riches of good arable&#13;
land but a very small population. When trade with Europe&#13;
became possible through improved transportation, it was&#13;
obvious that exports of products using land would be&#13;
exchanged for imports of products using labor. The&#13;
scarcity of labor in the United States was so great that&#13;
there were not sufficient workers to cultivate all the&#13;
land which could have been used advantageously for the&#13;
export of wheat to Europe; even to the extent that the&#13;
land was cultivated, this was done largely by the&#13;
substitution of land for labor, that is, to use a common&#13;
phrase by extensive cultivation. As a result, rents were&#13;
low and wages were high in the United States, compared&#13;
with the rest of the world, and trade alone could not&#13;
level out these discrepancies. Apart from costs of&#13;
transportation, trade must equalize the prices of a given&#13;
product throughout the world. But when a given product&#13;
is produced by different quantities of each factor of&#13;
production in the United States and Europe, then it is&#13;
not only possible, but necessary, that the relative and&#13;
absolute prices of the factors of production must differ&#13;
in the two exchanging countries ... On this basis the&#13;
emigration of Europeans to the United States is easily&#13;
explained (1919, pp. 290-1).&#13;
Thus, the wide disparity in factor endowment ratios made for differences in&#13;
factor prices and hence provided an incentive and a need for international&#13;
factor mobility.&#13;
Even if some of the assumptions of the theorem are violated, trade&#13;
alone might still result, as in Heckscher's example, in the partial&#13;
equalization of factor prices. This viewpoint was in fact shared by Ohlin,&#13;
who in his 1933 treatise has indicated that free trade only implies a tendency&#13;
toward equalization. Once again it is Samuelson who formally establisheld this&#13;
proposition. In a paper entitled "Ohlin was right", Samuelson (1971) has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
shown that, for the so-called Richardo--Viner model, where there are n goods, n&#13;
sector-specific factors, and one factor that is freely mobile across all&#13;
sectors, complete commodity price equalization only tends to equalize factor&#13;
prices internationally. Note that this model can be viewed as a short-run&#13;
version of the usual two factor Heckscher-Ohlin model when one factor is&#13;
temporarily immobile across sectors. We will return to the&#13;
Ricardo-Viner model later on.&#13;
In conclusion, as long as one accepts that differences in factor&#13;
endowments form the basi:3 for trade, theory can reasonably be made to predict&#13;
that trade reduces factor price discrepancies (although it coulcl instead&#13;
predict the opposite result as, for instance, if there were factor intensity&#13;
reversals).   What this implies is that trade can be considered as a (partial)&#13;
substitute for factor movements in the sense that an increase in the volume of&#13;
trade reduces international differences in factor prices and hence the&#13;
incentive for factor movements.&#13;
As long as impcrtant reward differentials exist, generated by either&#13;
the presence of trade re!strictions or other factors, there will be an&#13;
incentive and a need for factor movements. The incentive concerns individual&#13;
factor owners who choose the location of employment of their factors that&#13;
gives the highest reward. These private considerations coincicle with global&#13;
welfare since factor movements are also a need if world income is to be&#13;
maximized.&#13;
Since factor prices differ sharply, especially between industrialized&#13;
and developing countries, increased factor movements can be expected to&#13;
improve world efficiency. Yet, as we have seen in Chapter 3, such movements&#13;
are usually restricted by national governments. The reason is obviousLy that&#13;
governments serve eithetr their country's national interest or particular&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
national constituencies rather than the global interest. It is in this&#13;
perspective that actual choices between trade and factor mobility or between&#13;
alternative forms of such mobility have to be examined.&#13;
The Choice Between Labor and Capital Mobility: Europe versus Japan&#13;
We have seen earlier that, faced with "labor shortages", Europe&#13;
decided to import labor while Japan chose to export capital. In this section&#13;
we will further examine the experience of these two economies and attempt to&#13;
relate it to their pattern of trade with deveLoping countries.&#13;
A. Europe&#13;
The description of the guestworker program given earlier impLies that&#13;
the number and sectoral allocation of foreign workers in Europe are&#13;
essentially the result of the action of employers in these countries. In his&#13;
recent study on migrant labor and industrial societies, Piore (1979) notes&#13;
that declining industries (for example, textiles, garments, and shoes) appear&#13;
to be consistent employers of immigrants. Furthermore, he observes that "the&#13;
industries where migrants are concentrated ... are under very intensive&#13;
competitive pressure from abroad ... and, if migration was curtailed they&#13;
would no longer survive domestically and the goods they produce would be&#13;
imported." These facts suggest that immigration policies have been usled by&#13;
European employers in structurally weak sectors as a means of remaining&#13;
competitive. Indeed, one way for industries to resist the competition from&#13;
labor-abundant developing countries is to try reducing their labor costs.&#13;
Obtaining labor permits for immigrant workers offers precisely this&#13;
possibility. (Obviously, another way would be to seek the protection of trade&#13;
barriers.)&#13;
Recently, Bhagwati (1982) and Sapir (1983) have used theoretical&#13;
models to investigate the relationship, in a capital-abundant economy such as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 29 -&#13;
Germany, between trade competition and immigration from labor-abundant&#13;
countries. In his paper, Sapir shows how a shift in comparative advantage in&#13;
favor of developing countries can lead to labor immigration within the context&#13;
of a Ricardo-Viner model with two sectors and three factors (two sector-&#13;
specific types of capital and labor). The key here is that immigration can be&#13;
viewed as a way to redistribute income in favor of the owners of capital in&#13;
the labor intensive sector who are injured by the shift in comparative&#13;
advantage due to the immobility (across sectors) of their capital. In this&#13;
model, domestic (German) workers lose from an inflow of foreign workers, but&#13;
it is not difficult to see why, in fact, German and other Europe!an workers&#13;
accepted the guestworker policy until 1973. First, the growth rate of the&#13;
economy and the demand for labor were sufficiently buoyant to ensure that the&#13;
added supply of labor did not prevent wage rates from continuing to rise--&#13;
albeit at probably a slower pace than otherwise. Second, only German workers&#13;
competing with foreign workers are likely to have been hurt, others might in&#13;
fact have gained. This is especially the case since guestworker programs in&#13;
general prevented or, at least, restricted immigrant labor from moving either&#13;
across sectors or up thE skill ladder. Such a segmentation of the labor&#13;
market was probably an important factor. After 1973, the demand conditions&#13;
drastically changed in the labor market and the opposition of labor to further&#13;
recruitment of foreign workers dominated (politically) the ever-present desire&#13;
of employers for an abundant supply condition.&#13;
In the Bhagwati-Sapir analysis, the immigration policy is the result&#13;
of a shift in comparative advantage in favor of developing countries for labor&#13;
intensive industries. rhis policy is therefore aimed at resist-ing a&#13;
structural adjustment, implying a redistribution of certain (labor-intensive)&#13;
activities in favor of developing countries. In their models, if immigration&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
were not allowed, the shift in comparative advantage would have implied a&#13;
process of structural adjustment involving a continuous decrease in the&#13;
production of labor intensive goods and an increase in the production of&#13;
capital intensive goods. Therefore, given the relative factor endowments of&#13;
industrialized and developing countries, the European type of labor migration&#13;
has substituted for (i.e. decreased) the Heckscher-Ohlin trade between these&#13;
two regions.&#13;
The fact that the emigration of labor from developing Mediteranean to&#13;
industrialized European countries has been a substitute for trade and&#13;
therefore a factor reducing the pressure for structural adjustment has been&#13;
examined by Bourguignon and Gallais-Hamonno (1977) and Hiemenz and Schatz&#13;
(1977). Both these works have also insisted that protection against countries&#13;
with an abundant supply of labor has reinforced the effect that immigration&#13;
has had on structural adjustment in Europe.&#13;
B. Japan&#13;
Quite to the contrary, Japan's policies seem to have been aimed at&#13;
accelerating the process of structural adjustment. This is the case, in&#13;
particular, of her invest abroad program. Japan's manufacturing investments&#13;
differ from American and European investments not only by the fact that they&#13;
are much more concentrated in developing countries, but also by their sectoral&#13;
composition. In Asia, where most Japanese investments in developing countries&#13;
are located, more than 50 percent are in textiles, electrical appliances and&#13;
other labor intensive activities.&#13;
As Nayyar (1978) has indicated in his study of multinational&#13;
corporations, Japanese overseas investments have been largely export oriented,&#13;
one of their primary functions being often exports back to Japan. Kiyoshi&#13;
Kojima has written extensively on the nature of Japanese direct foreign&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
investment, which he contrasts to American or European investment. His&#13;
zinalysis of "Japanese type, trade oriented" investment is based upon factor&#13;
endowments as determinants of comparative advantage. Kojima argues that&#13;
Japan's manufacturing investments in Asia have been undertaken in industries&#13;
becoming comparatively disadvantageous in Japan (due to a rapid change in her&#13;
iactor endowments) and which had the potential of becoming comparatively&#13;
aidvantageous in the host country. In his recent collection of essays, Kojima&#13;
:1978) describes how this process has operated in the case of textiles:&#13;
As the economic growth in Japan accelerated, wages&#13;
increased. This made it more costly to produce labor&#13;
intensive commodities. Therefore, since the wage rate in&#13;
Korea, for instance, is one-third or even a quarter of&#13;
that in Japan and labor efficiency is high, Japanese&#13;
capital, superior technology and management skill entered&#13;
Korea to create a textile industry ... As Korea was&#13;
originally abundant in cheap labor, it potentially&#13;
possessed comparative advantage in the production of such&#13;
labor intensive manufactures. (p. 16)&#13;
Turning around the Ricardo-Viner model of Sapir (1983), it can easily&#13;
be seen how the inflow of foreign capital can increase and, hence, complement&#13;
the Heckscher-Ohlin trade between industrialized and developing zountries.&#13;
Indeed, assume now that, instead of importing labor, the labor-intensive&#13;
sector in the industrialized country which suffers a shift in comparative&#13;
advantage decides to reduce its activity in that country by exporting some of&#13;
its capital to a labor-abundant economy. With sector-specific capital, the&#13;
inflow of foreign capital. in the labor-intensive sector of the host country&#13;
results in an increase of production for that sector and a decrease for the&#13;
capital-intensive sector. Hence, this type of capital migration is trade&#13;
oriented since the labor abundant country will not export more of the labor-&#13;
intensive commodity and vice versa for the capital-abundant country.&#13;
In this model, workers in the home country (Japan) lose from an&#13;
outflow of capital just Like German workers were losing previously from an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
inflow of foreign workers, but again it is not too difficult to see why they&#13;
accepted the invest abroad policy. First, the rate of capital accumulation&#13;
and technological progress in Japan are sufficiently rapid to ensure that the&#13;
outflow of capital does not produce a substantial slow down in the growth of&#13;
wages. Second, the structural adjustment of the economy is viewed by all&#13;
parties as a necessary process and is prepared accordingly. In a sense it&#13;
could be said that the rate of time preference appears to be lower in Japan&#13;
than in Europe, where the guestworker program seems to have been set up&#13;
bearing in mind only a short-term horizon. As Franko and Stephenson (1982)&#13;
note:&#13;
While the Europeans have attempted with greater or lesser&#13;
success to adapt to the process of change, Japanese&#13;
companies have generally promoted it ... Perhaps most&#13;
distinctively of all, they have [done this by carrying]&#13;
out a programme of active, export oriented foreign&#13;
investment in those sectors (synthetic fibres and TVs)&#13;
where the competitive edge has passed to lower-cost, NIC&#13;
suppliers.&#13;
V. Conclusion: The Choices&#13;
If one theme runs throughout this essay it is that population growth&#13;
and changes in other factor endowments generate pressures to reorganize the&#13;
international division of labor and/or relocate factors of production.&#13;
Although such a process is desirable from the viewpoint of global efficiency,&#13;
it is likely that nation-states will continue to resist it for the benefit of&#13;
either a country as a whole (in the case of large countries enjoying monopoly&#13;
power) or powerful groups of citizens.&#13;
Freer trade and the implied reorganization of the international&#13;
division of labor along the lines described in Chapter 2 would probably result&#13;
in a tendency for international factor prices to move closer to one another.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
Leaving aside the (politically remote) possibility of international&#13;
compensation based on the gain in efficiency for the world economy, this&#13;
tendency would mean, ceteris paribus, lower wages and higher rentals in&#13;
inrdustrialized countries as. well as higher wages and lower rentals in&#13;
developing countries. (Obviously, these static effects might themselves&#13;
induce dynamic effects of a quite different nature.)     However, the experience&#13;
oi the past three decades with a rapid expansion of world trade suggests that,&#13;
even with freer trade, several factors (including wide international&#13;
d:.fferences in relative factor endowments) will continue to cause factor&#13;
p-ices to remain relatively far apart between industrialized and developing&#13;
countries. Whether or not such differences will persist in being sufficiently&#13;
large to induce pressures on factor movements remains to be seen. Indeed,&#13;
daspite considerable international flows in the recent past, factors of&#13;
production tend to be subjected to great inertia. This is especially the case&#13;
for labor but applies to capital as well.. For labor, not only wage&#13;
differentials but also absolute wage levels seem to influence the desire to&#13;
migrate.  This is exemplified by the case of Italy where, despite the&#13;
persistence of wide wage differentials with other EEC countries to which&#13;
Italian labor could freely migrate, the income level seems now su:-ficient to&#13;
reduce such migration considerably. On the other hand, for capital, the risk&#13;
factor (new environment, possiblity of expropriation, etc.), especially in&#13;
developing countries, acts as a strong deterrent against more important&#13;
foreign direct investment.   In Japan, more than in either America or Europe,&#13;
t.he government has reacted against this factor by encouraging joint ventures&#13;
with local firms and participating in the financing of overseas investment.&#13;
In the author's view, to the extent that it can accomplish what&#13;
factor movements do, trade! ought, probably, to be preferred to either labor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
migration or capital movement. One reason for this is that, as Diaz-Alejandro&#13;
and Helleiner (1982) put it, while "trade in goods can be quite unintrusive,&#13;
... many cultures, however, find the intimacy with foreigners involved in&#13;
factor movements ... too high a price to pay for the economic gains that those&#13;
transactions may generate." The recent problems related to the large-scale&#13;
presence of migrant workers in Europe illustrate this point sufficiently&#13;
clearly. Another reason is that individual trade flows can more or less&#13;
easily be turned on and off, while inflows of foreign labor or capital can&#13;
hardly be reversed. With trade a country acquires the service of factors of&#13;
production, while with labor or capital movements it acquires also those&#13;
factors themselves.&#13;
If disparities in factor prices render international mobility&#13;
inevitable, what form should it take? To begin with, if natural resources are&#13;
the cause of such disparity (as in oil-rich countries or in nineteenth century&#13;
America), it is quite obvious that it is (at least partially) mobile factors&#13;
such as labor and capital that have to move. Besides the previous case, there&#13;
might be certain circumstances under which labor and capital flows take the&#13;
same direction. This could be true if investment conditions in a low-income&#13;
location were particularly unfavorable due, for instance, to the lack of&#13;
infrastructure. Ohlin (1977) cites the case of Italy after World War I where&#13;
considerable amounts of capital and labor flowed from the south to the&#13;
north. In general, however, labor migration and capital movements can be&#13;
regarded as substitutes for one another. The choice between these two forms&#13;
of factor mobility involves several considerations. First, there is an&#13;
asymmetry between capital and labor movements in the sense that, usually, only&#13;
in the latter case does the factor of production move with its service.&#13;
Therefore in this case, as Bhagwati (1979) has argued, one needs to worry&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
ajout which country's welfare migrants need to be included in. Welfare&#13;
c mparisons of the choice between capital and labor mobility could produce&#13;
different results depending on which country's welfare criterion migrants&#13;
belong to (see, for instance, Bhagwati and Srinivasan (1983) and Wong&#13;
(1983)). Second, there is another asymmetry arising from the undesirable&#13;
social effects of labor migration, especially in the case of guestworker&#13;
Trograms. On this account, capital movements are more desirable than labor&#13;
migration.  Finally, as we have seen in the case of Europe and Japan, the&#13;
' right type" of capital exports (a la Japan) is likely to have much more&#13;
ifavorable repercussions on the dynamics of comparative advantage than the&#13;
"wrong type" of labor imports (a la Europe).&#13;

            This paper examines whether and how
            international economic relations between the industrialized
            and the developing countries might accommodate the growing
            North-South demographic and income gaps. Three channels of
            international relations are analyzed: trade, capital
            movements, and international migration. The trade-offs, if
            any, between trade and factor movements, and between capital
            movements and international migration, are also
            investigated. The study combines economic theory and
            historical evidence on trade and factor movements.
