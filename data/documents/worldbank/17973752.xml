Note: Marie Linahan wrote to Karl O. Lawrence of the Bank Archives in 1991 that,&#13;
as she had mentioned to him in an earlier telephone conversation, â&#128;&#156;because of the&#13;
many changes I wished to make in the transcript, I was retyping it.â&#128;? This transcript&#13;
is Ms. Linahanâ&#128;&#153;s typed version.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: This is Robert Oliver about to conduct a conversation with Ms. Marie&#13;
Linahan on July 19, 1986. It's a pleasure to be here, and may I ask at the outset if you&#13;
would say a word about your career, about yourself and about how you came to the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: I was born and raised in Binghamton, New York. After graduating from&#13;
high school I worked as a stenographer in a law office in that city. It was a small firm,&#13;
but a good one, and I learned a great deal in the two years spent in their employ. In&#13;
1928 I wanted to move to New York and through an uncle I got a job with a lawyer&#13;
who was a friend of his. After about a year I applied and obtained a position as a&#13;
stenographer with the Wall Street law firm of Davis, Polk, Wardwell, Gardiner and&#13;
Reed. After a few months I was assigned to Mr. Whitney Debevoise, one of the&#13;
young lawyers. He shared an office with Mr. William Stevenson. In 1931, Mr.&#13;
Debevoise and Mr. Stevenson decided to start their own law firm and invited me to&#13;
join them. I worked there for 15 years.&#13;
&#13;
After the war I became "disenchanted" with living in New York City. There had been&#13;
many changes in the Debevoise firm and Mr. Stevenson had left to become president&#13;
of Oberlin College. In February of 1947 I visited Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson in Oberlin,&#13;
Ohio. I mentioned to them that I was thinking of moving to Washington where my&#13;
sister lived. At that time, Mr. Drew Pearson had a news program on the radio every&#13;
Saturday night. He had predicted that Mr. John McCloy would become president of&#13;
the World Bank. I said I was considering applying for a job as I thought it might be&#13;
an interesting place to work. Mr. Stevenson said he would write him a letter&#13;
recommending me. I told Mr. Stevenson that I was planning to visit my sister in&#13;
Washington in March and gave him her address. When I arrived at my sister's there&#13;
was a message to call Mr. McCloy's office, which I did and arranged for an&#13;
appointment with Mr. McCloy and the personnel officer. About ten days later I was&#13;
pleased to receive a message from the personnel officer offering me an assignment as&#13;
a secretary in Mr. McCloyâ&#128;&#153;s office.&#13;
&#13;
It was necessary to have two secretaries in the president's office of the Bank. When&#13;
Mr. McCloy took over in March 1947 Miss Patricia Dermody was assigned to him.&#13;
She had been working for Mr. Eugene Meyer until his resignation. Mr. Ray Barnett,&#13;
who was secretary to Mr. McCloy in his New York law firm, became the other&#13;
secretary on a temporary basis. For family reasons Ray did not want to move to&#13;
Washington. It was fortunate for me to have applied for a job at this particular time.&#13;
Ray was also fortunate as he was assigned to the World Bank's New York office&#13;
which opened in April of 1947.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Marie Linahan&#13;
                             July 19, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Pat and I worked well together. She was familiar with the Washington scene and I&#13;
had some knowledge of banks and law offices in New York. We shared the overtime.&#13;
&#13;
I think Mr. McCloy was quite interested in the purpose of the World Bank and&#13;
enjoyed meeting international figures. He also liked the people coming to work at the&#13;
Bank. They were from many countries and were of high caliber. When he became&#13;
President there were fewer than 300 employees. He was pleased with favorable&#13;
publicity for the Bank, especially when joint annual meetings of the Bank and Fund&#13;
were held and many international bankers attended. It was a surprise when he&#13;
resigned in 1949 to become the U.S. High Commissioner to Germany. I was thrilled&#13;
to be working the Saturday morning when President Truman telephoned to ask Mr.&#13;
McCloy to come to see him at the White House. He instructed Mr. McCloy to walk&#13;
and to take the East Entrance. This was because there had been a great deal of talk as&#13;
to whether or not Mr. McCloy would become the High Commissioner. When Mr.&#13;
McCloy returned to the office he dictated a memorandum regarding the meeting and&#13;
his acceptance of the job in Germany.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Was it commonplace for you and Mr. McCloy to be working on a&#13;
Saturday in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: Yes. When he was in Washington, Mr. McCloy went to the office on&#13;
Saturdays and some Holidays, and either Pat Dermody or I worked.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did Mr. Black follow the same practice?&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: No. Not as much. He preferred to leave the office by 6:00 P.M. but very&#13;
often it would be later. It depended upon his schedule. He worked some weekends.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Do you know whether Mr. McCloy had difficulty deciding on becoming&#13;
High Commissioner to Germany rather than staying with the World Bank? Did he&#13;
think that High Commissioner was a more important job? Or was it just that the&#13;
President had asked him?&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: I think he was pleased to have been offered such a challenging job.&#13;
Before accepting I am sure he gave it considerable thought.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: There was also speculation, I am told, at that time--this would be '49--that&#13;
Mr. McCloy might possibly be a candidate for the Republican presidential&#13;
nomination. Were you ever aware of that?&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: No. I was not. He spoke about meeting General Eisenhower on a train&#13;
when he was on a trip to New York. And I heard him say he thought that General&#13;
Eisenhower would make a good president.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Let us move into the period when Mr. Black was president. What kind of&#13;
&#13;
                                  Marie Linahan&#13;
                            July 19, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
highlights shall we relate in connection with Mr. Black's long and illustrious&#13;
presidency of the Bank? Let me ask at the outset, I suppose that you simply stayed in&#13;
the president's office as a secretary when Mr. Black moved in?&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: That's right. Pat Dermody went to Germany with Mr. McCloy and Mrs.&#13;
Jean Costello moved to the president's office. She was secretary while Mr. Black was&#13;
the Bank's U.S. Executive Director. She stayed about a year. She left the Bank&#13;
because her husband was transferred out of the area. Miss Constance Ladue replaced&#13;
her, and we worked together until Mr. Black retired in December 1962.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, bond sales were surely important and Mr. Black's becoming&#13;
president must have made it easier to sell Bank bonds because of his familiarity with&#13;
the bond market.&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: He made a great many telephone calls to bankers. I don't feel qualified&#13;
to comment on bond sales.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Do you happen to remember the circumstances which led the Bank to&#13;
choose Morgan Stanley and First Boston as its major agents for marketing Bank&#13;
bonds? Do you remember the names of people in New York--I'm wondering&#13;
specifically, of course, whether George Woods had a hand in this.&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: I don't know the answers to these questions. I know that Mr. Woods of&#13;
First Boston and Mr. John Young of Morgan Stanley were in frequent communication&#13;
with Mr. Black.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: The names are not so important as the processes.&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: I wasn't familiar with the processes.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You may remember Mr. William Bennett.&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: I remember him very well. I understand he was a great help in bond&#13;
matters, especially in dealing with New York bankers.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Having introduced the name, George Woods, would you just say a bit&#13;
about the relationship between Mr. Black and Mr. Woods. I think Mr. Black talked to&#13;
Mr. Woods frequently, not only about the bond market but projects and that sort of&#13;
thing.&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: Mr. Black had frequent telephone conversations and meetings with Mr.&#13;
Woods about many matters. Mr. Woods seemed to be interested in going on missions&#13;
abroad. I remember he went to India and Egypt.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Maybe you'd say a word about Mr. Black's personality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Marie Linahan&#13;
                            July 19, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: He was thoughtful and friendly, a true Southern gentleman. He was&#13;
well liked by the staff. In the early days of the Bank at the annual picnics he would&#13;
take part in the sports, playing baseball, running in races, etc. Mrs. Black and he&#13;
attended the Christmas parties and took part in the festivities. He was a really good&#13;
diplomat. I understand that at some business conferences there might be arguments&#13;
and, although he would get his points across, the meetings would end on a friendly&#13;
note after he would tell a joke.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You've been talking about Mr. Black's outgoing personality and his&#13;
ability to tell a joke at the right moment to liven people up if they became too serious.&#13;
Can you contrast Mr. Black in this regard with Mr. Woods?&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: Mr. Woods was friendly but more reserved than Mr. Black. He had&#13;
lived in the New York area most of his life, whereas Mr. Black was raised in the&#13;
South. Mr. Woods was diplomatic and realized it was important in dealing with&#13;
international figures.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: He probably didn't have the same sense of humor; the ability to tell a&#13;
story at just the right moment.&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: Well, I think he could tell a good story, but I don't know of any&#13;
particular incidents.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Before we leave the subject of Black and Woods would you say that Mr.&#13;
Black talked to Mr. Woods frequently when Mr. Black was president? Was Mr.&#13;
Woods a major counselor, so to speak?&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: I think he was, especially regarding the bond market. And I think Mr.&#13;
Black welcomed hearing Mr. Woods's opinions regarding India, for instance, and the&#13;
Suez Canal negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: In those days, when Mr. Black was in Washington and not traveling,&#13;
would you characterize his days? Would he be on the telephone a great deal and at&#13;
meetings? Would this comprise his day?&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: He would check the mail and dictate letters and memos; meet with top&#13;
staff; attend board meetings of executive directors. He also had many appointments&#13;
and telephone conversations with persons who were not affiliated with the Bank.&#13;
With regard to executive directors, - If Mr. Black wanted to take up a special&#13;
matter at a board meeting he might call individual directors to his office before the&#13;
formal meeting to get their views on what he was going to propose. I believe Mr.&#13;
Woods did the same.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Mr. Black was particularly adept, I think, at working with the executive&#13;
directors and maintaining their confidence and support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Marie Linahan&#13;
                             July 19, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: I believe he was.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did Mr. Black entertain the executive directors in his own home?&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: Yes, from time to time.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: How about members of the staff? Would you say just a word about Mr.&#13;
Black's social relationship with his staff?&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: He would invite different members of his staff to dinner parties when he&#13;
would be entertaining international figures. For instance, whenever Prime Minister of&#13;
Australia Menzies came to Washington Mr. Black had a dinner party for him and&#13;
members of the staff who were involved in Australian projects would be invited.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Which staff members would you say Mr. Black relied upon the most, so&#13;
to speak?&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: In the early days he relied on Mr. Robert Garner, the vice-president who&#13;
became the head of the International Finance Corporationn. After that he relied on Sir&#13;
William Iliff, Mr. Davidson Sommers, Mr. Burke Knapp, and Mr. Harold Graves. He&#13;
would also listen to the heads of the different departments and to loan officers who&#13;
would be in charge of special projects.&#13;
&#13;
In 1959 Mr. Black felt the need of a personal assistant who would be free to travel&#13;
with him on short, as well as, long trips abroad. So Nicholas Gibbs joined the&#13;
President's Office. His duties were to check on travel arrangements and schedules,&#13;
tickets, hotel reservations, expenses, all that sort of thing. When he was in&#13;
Washington, between trips, he assisted Mr. Black in various ways. After about a year&#13;
Mr. Gibbs took another job in the Bank. He was replaced by Mr. Joseph Verner Reed&#13;
who stayed until Mr. Black retired the end of 1962.&#13;
&#13;
When Mr. Woods became president in 1963, Mr. George Wishart became his&#13;
personal assistant. He was a great help to Mr. Woods not only in arranging travel but&#13;
in taking charge of answering mail and overseeing the affairs of the President's&#13;
Office. Miss Bernadette Schmitt, who was secretary to Mr. Woods at First Boston,&#13;
moved from New York to join the Bank and continue to act as his secretary.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, I think now it's appropriate for me to ask if you would say a word&#13;
about some of the trips you had the opportunity of going on with Mr. Black.&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: It was a long time ago and I no longer have records, but if you will bear&#13;
with me I sha1l mention the places and incidents which made the most impression on&#13;
me.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I think you were about to say that in India you tried to keep a diary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Marie Linahan&#13;
                            July 19, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: Yes. However, I didn't do a very good job. I was busy and jotted things&#13;
down when I had a chance.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And this is the diary you are now showing me.&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: Yes. I'd be glad to have you take it if you would like to have it.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: To keep or to look at?&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: To look at.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It seems to me that at some point the archives of the Bank might be very&#13;
happy to have that.&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: Oh. I don't think I'd want to give it to them.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: All right. I understand. But it's interesting to note that you have it.&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: Mr. Black liked to have Mrs. Black join him on trips abroad of more&#13;
than a week or two. As Mrs. Black wanted to have a secretary along, Constance&#13;
Ladue and I alternated trips. I felt very fortunate to draw three very interesting ones:&#13;
1952 - Around the world, two months; 1958 - East Africa and Cairo, five weeks;&#13;
1960 - West and North Africa, four weeks.&#13;
&#13;
In January 1952 our first stop was London. After about three days, we flew to&#13;
Bahrain where we stayed at the home of Mr. and Firs Max Thornberg located on an&#13;
island in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Thornberg was an advisor on oil to the Sheik. He&#13;
arranged for an appointment for Mr. Black with the Sheik at the Palace and Mrs.&#13;
Thornberg, Mrs. Black and I were delighted to tag along. We next went to Karachi,&#13;
Pakistan, staying at the Governor General's house. The Aga Khan was on a visit to&#13;
that city and Mr. Black had an appointment with him. Our next stops in Pakistan were&#13;
in Lahore and Peshawar. One day while Mr. Black was busy, Mrs. Black and I&#13;
were taken by auto over the Khyber Pass to the Afghanistan border. It was a thrilling&#13;
experience that Mr. Black said he was sorry to miss.&#13;
&#13;
From Pakistan we went to New Delhi, India, where we stayed in the mansion&#13;
formerly occupied by Viceroy Mountbatten. Mr. Black was extremely busy with&#13;
appointments, among them with Prime Minister Nehru. While in New Delhi, our&#13;
party was invited to lunch by Mr. G. D. Birla, a wealthy industrialist who was a&#13;
follower of Mahatma Gandhi. It was on the grounds of Birla House that Gandhi was&#13;
shot. We saw the site, where fresh flowers were kept. This was in 1952. I understand&#13;
that since then a monument has been erected.&#13;
&#13;
Our next stop was Calcutta. While there Mr. Leonard Rist and Mr. Joseph Rucinski&#13;
mentioned they were interested in going to Darjeeling. I said I'd like to see Mt.&#13;
Everest. Mr. and Mrs. Black did not wish to go but didn't object to our taking the trip.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Marie Linahan&#13;
                             July 19, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It was a rugged excursion. We stayed overnight in an "ancient" hotel. Got up at 4:00&#13;
A.M. to go by Jeep up Tiger Hill to see the sun rise on Kunchinjunga (spelling?). We&#13;
were about 10,000 feet above sea level. It was a thrill to watch the outline of the&#13;
snow-capped mountains come out of the darkness and to know we were looking at the&#13;
highest peaks in the world. I tried to see Mt. Everest but it was a dim view as it was&#13;
several miles distant.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Very interesting. Your mentioning Leonard Rist being a member of the&#13;
party leads me to ask: Did Mr. Black usually take with him on his travels several staff&#13;
people?&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: Yes he did. On this particular trip the members of our party, besides Mr.&#13;
and Mrs. Black and me, were: Mr. Leonard Rist, French, the director of the economic&#13;
department; Mr. Harold Graves, American, the director of public relations; and Mr.&#13;
Joseph Rucinski, a loan officer. Mr. Lars Bengston was in Pakiston and India part of&#13;
the time. Mr. Raymond Cope was with group in Australia.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did wives of staff members sometimes go along?&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: Not very often. Mrs. Michael Lejeune went on the trip to Africa in 1958&#13;
and Mrs. Siem Aldewereld joined us for part of the 1960 trip. I believe they were&#13;
entitled to go because their husbands had been away from home for long periods of&#13;
time working on special projects.&#13;
&#13;
Other places we visited in India were Jaipur, Taj Mahal, Bombay and the Kans Grass&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
After India we went to Ceylon and Thailand. Then to Australia. After a stop in&#13;
Sydney we went to Canberra where Mr. and Mrs. Black stayed at the home of Prime&#13;
Minister and Mrs. Menzies. While in Australia our group spent a weekend at a&#13;
sheep station where we had fun riding in jeeps and watching kangaroos and foxes&#13;
being chased. At that time the Bank was interested in Australian projects but I don't&#13;
remember what they were.&#13;
&#13;
The last country on our itinerary was New Zealand where the Bank was interested in&#13;
a forestry project. There were meetings in Wellington and Auckland. Before leaving&#13;
for the long flight (It was before jet travel.) to Honolulu, we were happy to have a few&#13;
days to rest at a fishing lodge.&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: In Honolulu Mr. Black worked on a speech he was to give in San&#13;
Francisco.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sounds like you accomplished quite a lot.&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: I think Mr. Black felt the trip was a success. For me it was a great&#13;
privilege to have traveled with the group and to have been around the world. We were&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                         8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
in San Francisco for three or four days before flying home.&#13;
&#13;
                             --------------------&#13;
&#13;
I don't remember the itinerary for the trip to East Africa and Cairo in the spring of&#13;
1958. Mrs. Black was not feeling well so did not go on this trip. Other than Mr. Black&#13;
and me there were Mr. and Mrs. Michael Lejeune and Mr. Nathaniel McKitterick.&#13;
Places we visited were: Leopoldville, Belgian Congo; Johannesburg,&#13;
Pretoria and Kruger Park, South Africa; Salsbury and Kariba, Southern Rhodesia;&#13;
Lusaka, Northern Rhodesia; Arusha, Tankanyika; Nairobi, Kenya; Entebbe, Uganda;&#13;
Khartoun, Sudan; and Cairo, Egypt. There were business meetings and social affairs&#13;
all along the way.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Black was particularly interested in Kariba because of the Bank's part in the dam&#13;
project. There were about 10,000 persons living in the town, most of whom had&#13;
moved there less than three years before our visit. It was amazing to me to see what&#13;
had been done in such a short time to establish a town for people involved in the&#13;
Kariba Dam project. We were taken on what seemed to me to be a thorough&#13;
inspection tour.&#13;
&#13;
In Johannesburg there was a dinner party at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Harry&#13;
Oppenheimer. Mr. Black expressed interest in visiting a gold mine. We were&#13;
surprised when it was arranged for our party to have a tour of a mine the next&#13;
morning. What a fascinating experience!&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You were telling earlier about a meeting of Mr. Black and Mr. Woods in&#13;
Egypt at the time of the Suez negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: Yes. When Mr. Black arrived at the airport in Cairo in April 1958, he&#13;
was met by General Raymond Wheeler, Sir William Iliff and Mr. George Woods, as&#13;
well as members of the press. There was a short press conference before Mr. Black&#13;
left for his hotel. Mr. Black had many talks with General Wheeler, Sir William Iliff&#13;
and Mr. Woods before and after his two meetings with President Nasser. I heard of an&#13;
incident that happened at one of the meetings.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: The incident?&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: Yes. I believe Mr. Black became quite friendly with President Nasser&#13;
and took his picture with a Polaroid camera. President Nasser was fascinated to see&#13;
the immediate result of the flash. So Mr. Black gave him the camera.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I think Mr. Black had the marvelous diplomatic capability of being&#13;
warm and outgoing in thinking of things like that to do with dignitaries.&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: Members of the press were on Mr. Black's trail in Cairo and kept&#13;
calling on the 'phone for appointments and some of them even waited in the lobby of&#13;

the hotel to try to see him on his way in or out. However, no statements were given to&#13;
them until the press conference held at ll:00 P.M. the night before he left Cairo.&#13;
It was held in the United Nations Information Center. General Wheeler also made a&#13;
statement to the press.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Black flew to London the next day. Mrs. Black joined him there. After a few days&#13;
Mr. and Mrs. Black, General Wheeler, Nat McKitterick and myself boarded the&#13;
Queen Elizabeth for a delightful sea voyage home. Mr. and Mrs. Lejeune were&#13;
anxious to see their children so they flew back to Washington.&#13;
&#13;
In the spring of 1960, Mr. Black took another trip to Africa. The party consisted of&#13;
Mr. and Mrs. Black, Mr. John Williams, Mr. Nicholas Gibbs, and me. Mr. and Mrs.&#13;
Siem Aldewereld were with us in Khartoun and in Southern Rhodesia. Mr. William&#13;
Diamond saw Mr. Black in Nigeria.&#13;
&#13;
To the best of my recollections the countries visited were: Sudan, Southern Rhodesia,&#13;
Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Mauritania, Tunisia and Morocco.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Black's purpose for visiting Southern Rhodesia again (he was there in 1958) was&#13;
to be present at the dedication of Kariba Dam. The Queen Mother was the honored&#13;
guest and was one of the speakers. Mr. Black had a private meeting with her.&#13;
&#13;
In Morocco Mr. Black was very busy. He had many meetings with government&#13;
officials. He called on the King, who was in poor health, and on the Crown Prince,&#13;
who is the present King Hassan. The Crown Prince hosted a dinner at the Palace in&#13;
honor of Mr. and Mrs. Black. It was â&#128;&#156;fabulous!â&#128;? I was happy to have been invited.&#13;
&#13;
Compared to the trip two years before, I noticed a great change in the attitudes of&#13;
Native Africans toward white persons, especially at airports. In 1958 attendants were&#13;
courteous and pleasant. This was not apparent in 1960. I don't think of any other&#13;
experiences on this trip that would be of special interest to you.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well thank you so much for your time today and your gracious interview.&#13;
It's been a great pleasure for me and I know the archives will benefit from having&#13;
your recollections. If you care to add to them when you get the typed transcript, I&#13;
surely hope you will.&#13;
&#13;
LINAHAN: I will.&#13;
