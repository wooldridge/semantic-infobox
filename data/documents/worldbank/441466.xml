Cross-subsidies normally run from interna-&#13;

and from business to residential service. Ironi-&#13;

effect of postponing new entry indefinitely  the idea that low, subsidized local telephone&#13;

rates is not to postpone new entry but to au-   suffering from chronic unmet demand for tele-&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
phone service, the key problem is inadequate   Cream skimming&#13;
supply (inadequate investment and inefficient&#13;
investment and operations), not inadequate   "Cream skimming," together with its cousin&#13;
demand. Furthermore, the lower costs and in-   "cherry picking," is the argument that new en-&#13;
creased innovation in service provision that  trants in telecommunications are likely to focus&#13;
result from a competitive market are likely in   on the most profitable parts of the market-&#13;
the long run to be at least as important as sub-   typically international and national long-distance&#13;
sidies in improving the affordability of tele-   and local business telephone service-or on the&#13;
phone service. In addition, there is evidence   largest customers in these market segments. As&#13;
from some countries that household subscrib-   a result, it is argued that a cross-subsidy scheme&#13;
ers who lose telephone service when they can-   would not be sustainable in the face of "cream&#13;
not afford to pay for it do so because of the   skimming" new entrants and that politicians&#13;
high-priced long-distance service component   would not be comfortable with the resultant rate&#13;
of their bill.2 Third, assumptions about the un-&#13;

one operator can be profitable for others and   been used to justfy the worst of all&#13;
therefore may not need to be cross-subsidized&#13;
at all.                                    possible economic outcomes in the&#13;
Cross-subsidies raise some complex issues. The&#13;
argument for them assumes that the scale Of   sector-a monopoly on a service that is&#13;
cross-subsidy required is very large. But a study   notprovided at all or notprovided to&#13;
in Australia found the required subsidy to be    is-           ar                                any&#13;
quite small.3 The argument also assumes, incor-   adequate standard.&#13;
rectly, that monopoly is required for cross-&#13;
subsidy to be possible. That is clearly wrong-&#13;
there are many examples of cross-subsidies   rebalancing, involving possibly unpopular in-&#13;
coexisting with competitive markets for telecom-   creases in local network access subscription&#13;
munications services. Also wrong is the assump-   charges. The discussion of this issue is then&#13;
tion that subsidies must be cross-subsidies,   essentially the same as the cross-subsidy dis-&#13;
between large groups of customers within the   cussion above. The cherry picking argument as-&#13;
telecommunications sector, and effectively ad-   sumes that in a competitive telecommunications&#13;
ministered by the monopolist. If subsidies are   services market, corporate customers are the&#13;
required to achieve political goals, direct, tar-   most profitable. This is not always the case. In&#13;
geted ones may be more appropriate. An im-   the United Kingdom and the United States, for&#13;
portant concern is that both cross-subsidies and   example, this market segment has one of the&#13;

            the catchphrases used by many telecom executives, civil
