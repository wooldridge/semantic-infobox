Reducing&#13;
the Cost of Water&#13;
and Sewerage&#13;
&#13;
In order to improve the affordability of water      Conventional system and condominial system&#13;
and sewerage connections to poor households,&#13;
the El Alto Pilot Project made use of cost-                                         Household&#13;

&#13;
developed in Brazil, and enlisted community&#13;
participation in the construction of the networks.&#13;
This approach succeeded in reducing connection&#13;
costs by around 40%.                                                                              Condominial&#13;

&#13;
Condominial network designs for water and&#13;
sewerage services were pioneered in Brazil              Conventional               Condominial&#13;
during the 1980s (Watson, 1995; Bakalian&#13;
et al., 1994). They involve routing water and&#13;
sewerage networks across pavements and&#13;
yards instead of down the middle of streets&#13;
(see diagram). What effectively happens is&#13;
that instead of giving each individual house&#13;
a connection to the trunk line, each block         and sewerage. Savings in the volume of soil&#13;
&#13;
of houses has a single connection to the           excavation as a result of shallower trenches&#13;

&#13;
building that has been laid on its side).          sewerage. These physical savings translate&#13;
&#13;
    For a number of reasons, this approach         into overall financial savings of the order of&#13;

substantially reduces the cost of network          24% for the sewerage service and 40% for&#13;

    Second, the design requires a narrower&#13;

    Third, pipes can be buried at a shallower&#13;
depth because there is no need to protect                                                                                 BOLIVIA-&#13;

    In the El Alto Pilot Project, the use of&#13;
condominial designs led to 10-20% savings                                                                                         OTAL&#13;

                                              costs are added to the network expansion&#13;
                                              costs, the overall cost saving achieved falls&#13;
                                              from 50% to around 40% for both the water&#13;
                                              and sewerage services.&#13;
                                                  Furthermore, there is some evidence to&#13;
                                              suggest that community participation, by&#13;
                                              building acceptance, serves to increase the&#13;
                                              proportion of households that connect to&#13;
                                              the sewerage network. The average&#13;
                                              connection rate was 75% in the various&#13;
                                              neighborhoods covered by the project, and&#13;

                                              covered by the project. The scarcity of&#13;
                                              information on non-project neighborhoods&#13;

Reaping the&#13;
Benefits of Water&#13;
and Sewerage&#13;
&#13;
Connecting a dwelling to water and&#13;
sewerage networks is in itself no guarantee&#13;
that the residents will actually reap the full&#13;
benefits of these services. This will only&#13;
happen if the household makes complemen-&#13;
tary investments in sanitary installations&#13;
(such as toilet, sink, shower), and household&#13;
members learn to change their hygiene&#13;
practices. These changes can be both costly&#13;
and difficult for the families in cultural terms.&#13;
    In the case of El Alto, households who&#13;
built their own bathrooms spent on avera-&#13;
ge about US$400 on materials and gave&#13;
16 days of their own labor. It is important&#13;
to note that these costs are substantial&#13;
compared with the costs of connecting to&#13;
the water and sewerage networks, which&#13;
come to a combined total of US$311. They&#13;
are also very high in relation to the average&#13;
monthly household income in El Alto which&#13;
stands at US$122.&#13;
    The adjustment to modern hygiene&#13;
practices also proved to be particularly&#13;
difficult for households in El Alto because&#13;
of a variety of cultural and geographical&#13;
factors. The city has been created largely&#13;
as a result of recent rural-urban migration,&#13;
and consequently people have had limited&#13;
exposure to modern sanitation practices.&#13;
Furthermore, due to the high altitude of the&#13;
city (4,100 meters above sea level) overnight&#13;
temperatures throughout the year drop to&#13;
freezing. This means that people are&#13;
unwilling to shower without hot water, which&#13;
can be prohibitively expensive.                   education and a micro-credit line to assist&#13;
    In the El Alto Pilot Project, these problems  households in spreading the costs of&#13;
were addressed by providing hygiene               bathroom construction.&#13;

                            intended to provide both technical and&#13;
                            (equally important) moral support for&#13;
                            households to adopt modern hygiene&#13;
                            practices, in particular by helping them to&#13;
                            construct their own bathrooms and&#13;
                            associated facilities. The component com-&#13;
                            prised two half-day workshops, followed up&#13;
                            by about four hours of personal visits to&#13;
                            each participating household. The social&#13;

El Alto Pilot Project provided households with&#13;
general information about the micro-credit&#13;
line, while Caja Los Andes representatives&#13;
visited the project sites once a week to&#13;
process applications.&#13;
   About a quarter of households applied&#13;
for credit, and three-quarters of these had&#13;
their applications approved. The average&#13;
value of credits was US$406, with a 32-&#13;
month term. At an interest rate of 1.92%&#13;
per month, this represents a monthly&#13;
repayment of US$14.21 or about 6.2% of&#13;

are a number of possible explanations for&#13;

unwillingness of households to get into debt&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This field note reports lessons from a
            recently concluded pilot project in the city of El Alto,
            Bolivia. The project aimed to find innovative ways of
            reducing the cost of providing water and sewerage
            connections to poor households, while at the same time
            ensuring that they reap the full benefits of these services.
            The results are encouraging. First, costs of both water and
            sewerage connections were reduced by around 40%. This was
            achieved by adopting a condominal network design (that
            connects groups of houses to the main supply rather than
            each individual home) and using volunteers from the
            community to carry out construction. Second, hygiene
            education resulted in an increase in the number of people
            installing bathrooms. The percentage of households who put
            in bathrooms (at75 percent) was twice that among people who
            did not receive training (35 percent). Water consumption
            also rose among these households by 30 percent, compared to
            what they used prior to education. Micro credits had a small
            effect in encouraging people to install bathrooms but did
            not succeed in reaching the poorest households and were thus
            eventually discontinued.
