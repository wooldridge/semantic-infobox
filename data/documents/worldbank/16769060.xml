            Scaling up rural sanitation : partnering on
            the road towards achieving total sanitation in East Africa
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In 2000, the United Nations Development
            Program set a Millennium Development Goal (MDG) to reduce,
            by half, the number of people without access to basic
            sanitation by 2015. In 2008, when projections showed that
            countries in Africa were unlikely to reach this target,
            delegates from 32 African countries drafted and signed the
            eThekwini Declaration and AfricaSan action plan to renew
            commitments and identify strategic actions. At the East
            Africa Sanitation Conference held March 2010, analysis of
            progress to date showed that most countries had national
            sanitation policies and plans, an encouraging sign, but that
            poor coordination, particularly at district level, continued
            to hamper improvements and that budget allocations for
            sanitation remained far below the target of 0.5 percent of
            Gross National Product (GNP) recommended in the eThekwini declaration.
