ECONOMIC MOTIVATION VERSUS CITY LIGHTS:&#13;
TESTING HYPOTHESES ABOUT INTER-CHANGWAT MIGRATION IN THAILAND&#13;
This paper is an expansion of the migration analysis done as part of the&#13;
Basic Economic Mission to Thailand and contained in Working Paper No.337. In&#13;
that paper net and gross, in and out migration were studied. In the current&#13;
paper the analysis is extended to include the direction as well as level of&#13;
migration flows between provinces (changwats) and this analysis is integrated&#13;
with that of others who have done migration research in Thailand.&#13;
The models tested here are of the gravity flow variety. They are tested&#13;
in two basic forms. The first is based on the assumption that it is only&#13;
the characteristics of the destination relative to the origin that matter.&#13;
The second is unconst-.ained and allows one to examine the characteristics&#13;
of origin and destinations separately.   While a number of questions remain&#13;
unanswered it is very clear from this analysis that:&#13;
(1) economic factors predominate over the non-economic attraction of urban&#13;
areas;&#13;
(2) the economic condlitions (income per capita, unemployment, and land scarcity)&#13;
in destinations relative to origins have significant relationships' in&#13;
the hypothesized direction;&#13;
(3) male and female migration streams respond to per capita income and unemploy-&#13;
ment in the same way. Males, however, are more responsive than females&#13;
to the scarcity or availability of farmland;&#13;
(4) migration to and from Bangkok tends to respond in a very similar manner&#13;
to relative income and the availability of farmland as migration to and&#13;
from other areas;&#13;
(5) in the unconstrained model, conditions in the area of destination all&#13;
have significant relationships of the hypothesized signs;&#13;
(6) conditions in the areas of origin play a far more complex role, since&#13;
conditions at l:he area of origin determine not only the push to migrate,&#13;
but also the ability to afford to migrate. For example, in all specifica-&#13;
tions the higher the per capita income in the sending area, the higher&#13;
the outflow of migrants;&#13;
(7) the sign and significance of other economic variables in the origin&#13;
vary depending on the specifications.&#13;
The major conclusion of policy relevance from this paper is that the&#13;
level of migration will increase as economic development proceeds, but the&#13;
direction of movement will depend on the relative economic opportunities in&#13;
various changwats. It: is the latter that might be most susceptible to policy&#13;
manipulation.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Although Thailand's population cannot be described as highly mo-&#13;
bile, both the upward trend in migration rates and the rapid growth in&#13;
the urban population have become a cause of some concern in the last two&#13;
or three decades.  Between 1955-1960 and 1965-1970 the rate of migration&#13;
between changwats (provinces)-/ increased by almost two-thirds.   Even&#13;
though both of these periods were characterized by a high degree of resi-&#13;
dential stability, particularly in rural areas, over three million per-&#13;
sons changed their place of residence (village or municipal area) at least&#13;
once in the latter per-iod, and about half of them moved across changwat&#13;
boundaries (Arnold and Boonpratuang, 1976).&#13;
The single most popular destination for inter-changwat migrants&#13;
continues to be Bangkok, which has grown rapidly to a metropolis of&#13;
more than four million residents. With over half of the country's urban&#13;
population and a population size more than forty times that of the next&#13;
largest city (Chiang Mai), Bangkok provides one of the most striking ex-&#13;
amples of urban primacy in the world (Piampiti, 1979). The rapid in-&#13;
crease in Bangkok's population has exacerbated a whole range of social&#13;
and economic problems in the capital city and has put a severe strain&#13;
on the government's ability to provide adequate public services to Bang-&#13;
kok's residents. In addition, the large influx of seasonal migrants&#13;
who augment Bangkok's permanent population during the agricultural slack&#13;
season further complicates government planning in this area.&#13;
Most urban population growth in Thailand is attributable to natural&#13;
increase, but Goldstein and his colleagues (n.d.: 692) have estimated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
that about forty percent of urban growth between 1970 and 1975 was due&#13;
to migration. As fertility rates continue to decrease, and as the urban&#13;
population of Thailand continues to expand, migration will continue to be&#13;
a major component, if not the major component, in the expansion of Thailand's&#13;
cities for the rest of this century.&#13;
Although migration to Thailand's cities, especially to Bangkcok, was&#13;
undoubtedly the factor that initially aroused an awareness of migra-&#13;
tion problems among policy makers and the public (Prachuabmoh and Tirasa-&#13;
wat, 1974), urbanward migration constitutes only a minor proportion of&#13;
all migration in Thailand. In fact, in the period 1965-1970, 72 percent&#13;
of all changes of residence took place entirely between nonmunicipal&#13;
areas (Arnold and Boonpratuang, 1976: 9). In the past, migration of this&#13;
type was often motivated by a search for new agricultural land, as rapid&#13;
population growth put increasing pressure on previously cultivated land.&#13;
Farmers have been faced with the prospect of cultivating more and more&#13;
marginal, inaccessible land. The vanishing frontier has become a mat-&#13;
ter of major concern in Thailand because the population continues to&#13;
grow rapidly (at over two percent per year) despite an impressive&#13;
decline in fertility rates throughout the country during the 1970s.   Un-&#13;
der these circumstances, if migration rates continue to increase in&#13;
Thailand (as most theoretical migration models and our analysis sug-&#13;
gest), population movement will become-an increasingly important con-&#13;
sideration in development planning.&#13;
The importance of internal migration has been explicitly recognized&#13;
in the Fourth National Economic and Social Development Plan (1977-1981),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
which is the first plan to include programs on population redistribu-&#13;
tion and human settlements. The plan seeks to redirect migrants to ur-&#13;
ban "growth poles" and to encourage migrants to move out of the Bangkok&#13;
Metropolitan Area by:&#13;
(a) controlling urban land use on the periphery of Bangkok;&#13;
(b) developing urban infrastructure (public utilities, educational&#13;
and health services, housing) in urban centers outside Bangkok;&#13;
(c) creating urban employment opportunities outside Bangkok by of-&#13;
fering monetary incentives to attract industries, commerce,&#13;
and services to regional centers and by establishing industrial&#13;
estates and export-processing zones; and&#13;
(d)  accelerating regional and rural development so that regional&#13;
urban centers will have local sources of raw materials and&#13;
marketing outLets for their products (Piampiti, 1979).&#13;
These policies are designed to affect: primarily the pull of urban areas&#13;
rather than the factors pushing migrants from rural areas. Similar&#13;
programs have met with only limited success in some settings, and it is&#13;
too early to assess the:ir impact in Thailand (Rhoda, 1979). But, as&#13;
in many places, the programs were formulated in the absence of satisfac-&#13;
tory information about either the causes or the consequences of inter-&#13;
nal migration.&#13;
This paper attempts; to shed some additional light on the determinants&#13;
of internal migration by means of a regression analysis of economic,&#13;
social, and demographic factors that are related to migration flows&#13;
at the changwat level. Data are taken primarily from the 1970 Popula-&#13;
tion and Housing Census. It is hoped that this analysis, together with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
the results of microlevel studies, will assist policy makers in design-&#13;
ing migration-related policies and programs.    First, the results should&#13;
help in predicting future migration flows. Inputs of this type are cru-&#13;
cial for population projections on which economic and social development&#13;
plans are based.2- Second, findings on the determinants of migration&#13;
can be used to formulate plans for altering migration streams according&#13;
to the goverrnent's goals.&#13;
The next section of the paper reviews some of the major theoretical&#13;
models of migration and the hypotheses that are derived from them. It&#13;
is followed by discussions of previous research on migration in Thailand&#13;
and the methodology and results of the current study. The final sec-&#13;
tion interprets some oE the major results in the Thai context and out-&#13;
lines some policy implications that follow from the analysis.&#13;
II. THEORETICAL MODELS OF MIGRATION&#13;
Migration can be studied from several perspectives and at different&#13;
levels of analysis. One can examine migration at the aggregate or the&#13;
individual level. At t:he aggregate level, the characteristics of the&#13;
region can be studied, whereas at the individual level, the characteris-&#13;
tics of the individuals who actually move may be analyzed. Although it&#13;
is possible to analyze the regional factors affecting migration choices&#13;
of individuals, it is much riskier to use regional data to make assump-&#13;
tions about the individuals who migrate.3/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
In the present context, we shall focus on aggregate migration flows&#13;
rather than individual migration. This focus is quite useful both for&#13;
predictions of the magnitudes of the migration flows and for policy, but&#13;
it cannot be used to determine the characteristics of the individual&#13;
migrants or therefore the compositional changes of sending or receiving&#13;
areas. In addition, we shall concentrate our analysis and thus our dis-&#13;
cussion of models on gross migration from one region to another.-/ This&#13;
approach involves the study of the volume of movement and the charac-&#13;
teristics of both the sending and receiving regions.&#13;
The most elementary model of gross migration between areas is based&#13;
on a simple analogy to the law of gravity.   That is, the flow (gravity)&#13;
between two areas (bodiLes) is directly proportional to the size of the&#13;
two regions (mass of the two bodies) and inversely proportional to the&#13;
distance between them (Zipf, 1946).&#13;
a1 a2,&#13;
M. . = k P  j&#13;
ij     ~a&#13;
(D ij) 3&#13;
where Mij is gross migration from area i to area j; Pi is the population&#13;
of area i; P. is the population of j; Dij is the distance between i and&#13;
j; and a and kc are constants. One major advantage of this simple formu-&#13;
lation is that it is multiplicative and can be estimated by a simple&#13;
log linear equation:&#13;
log Mij.   log k + a1 log Pi + a. log P. -     og D&#13;
~~.  2      a3logD..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
The gravity model is, of course, largely devoid of behavioral con-&#13;
tent and does not explain which decision or policy variables affect the&#13;
volume or direction of migration. Since these factors alone are quite&#13;
powerful in explaining migration, however, it is necessary to include&#13;
this mechanistic core in any behavioral model of gross migration to avoid&#13;
spurious results. A mtmber of models have been developed that attempt&#13;
to modify the gravity model to incorporate more interesting causal fac-&#13;
tors. Before examining these models, we shall review the theories of&#13;
the behavioral factors that determine gross migration.&#13;
Ravenstein's laws of migration, published in 1885, represent the&#13;
first attempt to describe migration in terms of demographic, social,&#13;
economic and geographic. characteristics of the flow. Ravenstein did&#13;
not attempt to develop a behavioral model of the factors determining&#13;
migration, but he did identify the variables that probably should be in-&#13;
cluded in such a model. He observed different behavior for urban and&#13;
rural residents and for males and females. He also stressed the impor-&#13;
tance of distance, level of development, and economic motivations for&#13;
migration.&#13;
In his 1966 paper, Lee developed a schematic model of the factors&#13;
determining the flow of migrants from i to j. This schema identifies&#13;
the important factors in the area of origin and the area of destination&#13;
and the intervening obstacles between the two. Factors characteristic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
of the sending region are high unemployment, low wages, poor climate and&#13;
topology, and lack of :recreational, educational and community facilities.&#13;
Factors associated withl the area of destination are high wages, low&#13;
unemployment, good clirnate, and so forth. Intervening variables include the&#13;
distance and the costs of moving. Various researchers have added inter-&#13;
vening opportunities between i and j as determinants of the flow be-&#13;
tween i and j (Stouffer, 1966).&#13;
Although all these factors characterize regions, a large number&#13;
of factors determining the migration of particular individuals have also&#13;
been discussed in the literature. Some of these are age (or stage in&#13;
the life cycle), sex, individual knowledge about the area of destination,&#13;
and personality traits. Whether these factors have aggregate counter-&#13;
parts is less certain. Human capital models of migration have concen-&#13;
trated on the cost and returns to individuals, but the variables used&#13;
do not differ substantially from those used by demographers and sociolo-&#13;
gists (Sjaastad, 1962).&#13;
A major alteration of the individual model of migration decision&#13;
making is Toda:ro's postulate that migration responds to differences in&#13;
expected rather than actual earnings (Todaro, 1969; Harris and Todaro,&#13;
1970). Expected gains are measured by the difference in real incomes&#13;
between work opportunities in sending and receiving regions and the&#13;
probability of the new rnigrant's obtaining a job in the area of destina-&#13;
tion. At the regional Level, this would imply that emphasis needs to&#13;
be given to both unemployment and wage or income levels. The exact&#13;
specification of the int:eraction of t.hese two variables would depend&#13;
on how expectations are formed by different individuals and how such&#13;
individuals are distributed in the two populations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
The primary impori;ance given to economic factors is common to most&#13;
theories of migration. The major exception is the role of cities per&#13;
se in attracting migrants. It has often been hypothesized that this ef-&#13;
fect is important independent of the economic opportunities offered by&#13;
cities. This is referred to as the "city lights" hypothesis.-/&#13;
As Lowry (1966) and others have shown, economic characteristics of&#13;
sending and receiving areas can be introduced into the gravity model in&#13;
al a2  a4&#13;
several ways.   A simple formulation might be M..    k  i     Ei  where E.&#13;
13     a3    a5&#13;
represents a summary measure of economic               D  3   E.5&#13;
opportunities in the i    region.  This could be estimated in one of two&#13;
ways, either as:&#13;
logij = log k + a1 log P. +     2 lg       -a3 log D.j + a4 log (E./Ej), if&#13;
a4 = -a5 or alternatively as:&#13;
log M.= log k-i-a1 log Pi + a2 log Pj + a3 log Dij + a4 log E      + a  log E&#13;
where there is; no restriction that a4 = -a5.&#13;
In the relative formulation, it is assumed that economic conditions&#13;
in the sending region relative to those of the destination affect the&#13;
flow of migrants; the alternative specification allows for separate&#13;
and possibly different effects of origin and destination characteristics.&#13;
The second specification makes it easier to assess the separate impor-&#13;
tance of push and pull factors in determining migration.    In our analysis&#13;
we shall test both models.&#13;
III. PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON INTER-CHANGWAT MIGRATION FLOWS IN THAILAND&#13;
It is only within the last two decades that an active interest has&#13;
been taken in documenting migration flows in Thailand and in examining&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9.-&#13;
the characteristics of migrants and the determinants of migration. Some&#13;
specialized surveys of migration from Northeastern Thailand to Bangkok&#13;
were published in the early 1960s (Textor, 1960; Meinkoth, 1962), and&#13;
the 1954 National Demographic and Social Survey provided some information&#13;
on the characteristics of migrants (Wichiencharoen, 1960). However, a&#13;
substantial amount of migration research was not undertaken until the&#13;
1960 census data became available.&#13;
Ng (1969, 1970) noted the complexity of the spatial pattern of mi-&#13;
gration streams in Thailand and pointed out the inadequacy of using the&#13;
normal four regional designations to study migratory movements. He there-&#13;
fore developed a set of ten "migration regions" based on 1960 census&#13;
data to describe clusters of administrative units that were characterized&#13;
by a substantial mutual. exchange of migrants. Within each region, the&#13;
population tended to move away from the center of high population den-&#13;
sity into more sparsely populated areas. This pattern led Ng to con-&#13;
clude that intraregional moves in the 1950s were determined largely by&#13;
the availability of agricultural opportunities. Our results show that&#13;
the availability of land is still an important determinant of migration.&#13;
Goldstein (1973) used a sample tape from the 1960 census to study&#13;
the characteristics of migrants, particularly the fertility behavior&#13;
of migrants and nonmigrants. Data on migration from the 1960 census&#13;
were also used in a stLLdy of migration patterns by Chapman and Allen&#13;
(1965), in a report to the Thai government by the International Labor&#13;
Office (1965), and in EL succession of masters' theses written by Thai&#13;
students (e.g., Siripal;, 1965; Chamratrithirong, 1973). Many of these&#13;
studies were mainly descriptions of migration patterns and the charac-&#13;
teristics of migrants, but some also attempted to identify the major&#13;
determinants (or at least the correlates) of migration flows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
Prachuabmoh and Tirasawat (1974) reviewed migration studies from 1947&#13;
to 1972 and summarized the major results of those studies. The au-&#13;
thors concluded that economic factors were the most important motives&#13;
for migration in Thailand and that push and pull factors were both im-&#13;
portant determinants oi migration.&#13;
The National LongiLtudinal Survey of Social, Economic, and Demogra-&#13;
phic Change also spawned several migration publications (Goldstein et&#13;
al., 1974; Goldstein and Pitaktepsombati, 1974; Tirasawat, 1977).&#13;
In addition, several st:udies focusing on particular aspects of migra-&#13;
tion, such as migration to Bangkok or other specific locations (Thai-&#13;
land, National Statistical Office, 1979; Sternstein, 1977; Piampiti,&#13;
1976) and female migration (Arnold and Piampiti, 1979; Piampiti, n.d.),&#13;
have appeared in the last few years. But more general studies of the&#13;
areal determinants of miigration on a national basis have relied mostly&#13;
on 1970 census data. At least four Ph.D. theses by Thai students have&#13;
explored the determinants of migration on a macrolevel with 1970 cen-&#13;
sus data (Prasartkul, 1977; Srisawas, 1977; Chamratrithirong, 1976;&#13;
Garnjana-Goonchorn, 1974). These studies differ substantially in a&#13;
number of key respects, including the type of model proposed, the mea-&#13;
sures of migration used, the provinces included in the calculations,&#13;
and the method of analysis applied to the data. These variations have&#13;
resulted in substantially different findings and somewhat different&#13;
conclusions.&#13;
The study by Garnjana-Goonchorn covers migration to the Bangkok&#13;
metropolitan area, whereas the other three studies include all 71&#13;
changwats (except for Bangkok and Thon Buri in some cases). Srisawas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-.11-&#13;
used the life table survival method to estimate net migration rates for&#13;
1960-70; the other three studies are based on five-year migration data&#13;
for 1965-70. All the authors used multiple regression to study inter-&#13;
changwat migration flows except for Chamratrithirong, who employed cor-&#13;
relation analysis. Because the census publications include only limited&#13;
information on the types of independent variables that are hypothesized&#13;
to influence migration., and because the scope and quality of alterna-&#13;
tive data sources are inadequate for this purpose, the researchers had&#13;
to be quite resourcefujl in finding data that were suitable for testing&#13;
their models. The three studies that used regression analysis all in-&#13;
corporated the standarcl gravity variables in their models; they also&#13;
included some economic variables, although the precise economic variables&#13;
selected were quite diverse (unemployment, income, population or land&#13;
pressure, socioeconomic development).&#13;
The gravity variabtles were generally found to be highly significant,&#13;
and the relationships were in the expected direction. The effect of dis-&#13;
tance, however, does nct appear to be linear. Both Chamratrithirong&#13;
and Prasartkul found support for the "critical distance" thesis, at&#13;
least in the case of migration to and from Bangkok. The negative ef-&#13;
fect of distance on migration was strong up to about 250-300 kilometers&#13;
from Bangkok but insignificant beyond that point. In addition, there&#13;
was a slight decrease in the significance of the distance effect on&#13;
migration to Bangkok between 1955-60 and 1965-70, probably due to the&#13;
availability of better transportation in the latter period (Prasartkul,&#13;
1977; Chamratrithirong, 1976).&#13;

The significance of economic factors in migration varied con-&#13;
siderably from one study to another. Overall, the weakest results were&#13;
obtained by Srisawas (1977), who found that the level of development,&#13;
educational attainment of an area, and degree of accessibility were&#13;
all unrelated to the volume of migration. The only significant effect&#13;
found was a negative eiffect of density on net migration, and the level&#13;
of explanation for the complete model was relatively low (R2 = .199).&#13;
The author attributes 1:he poor results to weaknesses in measurement&#13;
procedures and suggests that it would be better to use a measure of&#13;
population pressure on arable agricultural land or land in cultivation&#13;
than a simple density measure. Chamratrithirong (1976), on the other&#13;
hand, found the level of socioeconomic development to be highly correlated&#13;
with migration flows. His measure of development (the proportion of the&#13;
economically active population in the primary sector) was posivively related&#13;
to in-migration, out-migration, and gross migration for both females and&#13;
males. He stressed the importance of physical and cultural facilitating&#13;
factors rather than "push" factors in explaining migration flows:&#13;
On the one hand, it is clear that push factors account for&#13;
a great number of out-migrants from the poorer provinces.&#13;
However, when the analysis shifts from the numbers of mi-&#13;
grants to migration rates, the characteristics of the more&#13;
developed provinces seem to facilitate moves. This is par-&#13;
ticularly visible in the case of out-migration to Greater&#13;
Bangkok. It appears that areas which have the more modern&#13;
characteristics, also have populations which are more likely&#13;
to migrate to the capital city (pp. 173-5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
These results support Davisks thesis of "relative deprivation" since&#13;
migration does not seemn to be directly stimulated by poverty.&#13;
Prasartkul (1977) emphasized the effect of "pull" factors on mi-&#13;
gration. In general, conditions at the destination gave a better fit&#13;
than conditions at the origin. Population pressure was found to be more&#13;
important at the destination than at the origin.   Migrants tended to move&#13;
from changwats with low employment rates to those with high employment&#13;
rates, and more migrant:s moved to changwats with high rates of business&#13;
investment and a low degree of social structural disequilibrium. The&#13;
results, however, were highly dependent on the particular model tested.&#13;
The additive model explained only 25 percent of the variance and almost&#13;
all characteristics were insignificant. The multiplicative model, on&#13;
the other hand, explained 60 percent of the variance, but even with this&#13;
model, the socioeconomic and demographic variables by themselves were not&#13;
2&#13;
very effective (R = .08).&#13;
The best overall level of explanation was obtained by Garnjana-&#13;
Goonchorn (1974) for migration to the Bangkok Metropolitan Area.    Once&#13;
again, the choice of models is crucial. The log linear form explained&#13;
2                                2&#13;
more of the variance (R   = .85) than the linear form (R   = .61), and&#13;
the explanatory power was slightly better for females than for males in&#13;
both cases. The neoclassical economic variables (average monthly earn-&#13;
ings and unemployment) were significant in the linear model but not in&#13;
the log linear form. Finally, a set of variables added to measure in-&#13;
tervening opportunities was found to be insignificant in the linear&#13;
model and onlY Dartlv successful in the lo2 linear model.&#13;

The present study builds upon the work summarized above, makes modi-&#13;
fications to overcome some of the problems identified in those studies,&#13;
and expands the analysis into new areas. Our analysis differs from some&#13;
or all of the previous studies in the following important ways:&#13;
(a)  All nonzero inter-changwat migration streams are included in&#13;
the analysis. Other studies rely on the published census&#13;
volLumes which do not print data for small migration streams.&#13;
The present study is based on complete data for all migration&#13;
flows from the unpublished 71 x 71 matrix of migration for&#13;
Thailand. (Since Bangkok and Thon Buri are combined, the analy-&#13;
sis uses n 70 x 70 matrix.)&#13;
(b) The analysis is conducted for all changwats together and for&#13;
Bangkok and non-Bangkok migration separately.&#13;
(c)  Female and male migration streams are analyzed separately and&#13;
the data are also pooled.&#13;
(d) Interaction effects are included in the equations.&#13;
(e)  Both the relative and expanded gravity models are tested.&#13;
(f) Some of the key variables are measured differently from other&#13;
studies. In :particular, land pressure is measured by propor-&#13;
tion of land farmed rather than simply density and unemploy-&#13;
ment includes those waiting for agricultural employ.ment at the&#13;
time of the census.&#13;
Probably the greatest departure from the previous studies is the choice&#13;
and measurement: of variables included in the model. A detailed description&#13;
of the variables in the model and the results of the analysis are presented&#13;
in the next section.&#13;

IV. THE ANALYSIS&#13;
The data for this analysis were obtained primarily from the 1970&#13;
census of population. Interprovincial migration is measured by the num-&#13;
ber of people who had lived in their 1970 place of residence for less than&#13;
five years and whose previous place of residence was a different changwat.-&#13;
The study includes all combinations of origin and destination in which&#13;
there was at least one person who migrated from one changwat to another.&#13;
It is necessary to exc:Lude those combinations where there were no migrants&#13;
in order to use a log specification. It is unlikely that this exclusion&#13;
will cause serious bias since only 1.6 percent of the possible combina-&#13;
tions have no migration.  Other studies, however, which have relied on&#13;
published data may be subject to serious bias, since published data ex-&#13;
clude migration flows cf less than thirty persons which results in the&#13;
delet:ion of forty percent of the flows.&#13;
In this paper, the economic variables included in the analysis are&#13;
those most relevant to the Thai environment. To adapt the model to the&#13;
Thai context, it is necessary to recognize the importance of rural-to-&#13;
rural migration. Therefore, the availability of farmland has been added&#13;
to the standard economiz variables of income and unemployment. In ad-&#13;
dition, the proportion of population living in urban areas was added&#13;
to test the city lights hypothesis. Ideally, we would wish to measure&#13;
our independent variables at the beginning or middle of the 1965-70&#13;
period since we want to examine their causal effect on migration and&#13;
ignore the possibility that migration may have in fact affected the&#13;
level of the independent variables.  For income and proportion of land&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
fanmed, it was possible to obtain figures for 1967 and 1961/62, respec-&#13;
tively, but measures oF unemployment and urbanization were obtained from&#13;
the 1970 census.- This might lead to a bias in the coefficients of these&#13;
8/&#13;
variables,-   but given the relatively small magnitude of migration overall&#13;
we do not expect this b)ias to be large.-/&#13;
Thus the model to be tested is:&#13;
aL  a2     a4 a  6 a8 aR &#13;
M.    k    pi    .    Ii u.   F.8 UR'0&#13;
lj                    1 &#13;
a3       a Ia  7 a9     11&#13;
D.  ~  I.   U.  F.  UR.&#13;
:Lj       j   j   j     J&#13;
where Ii and I. represent per capita. income in area of origin i and area&#13;
of destination j, Ui and Uj represent unemployment (including those wait-&#13;
ing for agricultural work), F. and Fj represent the proportion of land&#13;
farmed, and URi and URj represent the proportions of the population&#13;
urban.     For the relative model we restrict the coefficients so that&#13;
a4    a5, a6     a7, a8     a9 and alo    a11&#13;
The log linear formulation of the relative model implies that:&#13;
(a)  the.coefficient on Ii/I. should be negative, since the higher&#13;
the income ir! the sending area relative to the receiving&#13;
area, the less attractive migration should appear.&#13;
(b)  the coefficient on Ui/U. should be positive, since higher&#13;
unemployment in the origin than the destination should en-&#13;
courage migration;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
(c)  the coefficient on Fi/F. should be positive, since the more&#13;
land already farmed in i relative to j, the greater the oppor-&#13;
tunities for homesteading new land in j relative to i (a major&#13;
factor in rural-to-rural migration);&#13;
(d)  the coefficient on URi/UR. can be expected to be negative if&#13;
urbanization per se is attractive to migrants independent of&#13;
its effects on economic opportunities;&#13;
(e) Pi and P. should have positive coefficients equal to 1;&#13;
(f) D.. should have a negative coefficient.&#13;
In the expanded model, the coefficients are unrestricted and their&#13;
signs are less certain. If only the relative values and not the absolute&#13;
values of the variables matter, then all variables in i will have the same&#13;
sign as in the relative model, and all variables in j will have the oppo-&#13;
site sign since they appear in the denominator of the ratio.    For example,&#13;
I. would have a negative sign and I. would have a positive sign. These&#13;
1                                  J&#13;
are the coefficients hypothesized by Todaro in a recent paper (Todaro, 1980).&#13;
If the origin and destination variables play independent roles, the signs&#13;
need not follow this simple pattern.&#13;
As suggested by Ravenstein, the importance of these factors may dif-&#13;
fer for male and female migrants. Therefore, the above models were&#13;
tested for differences in the behavior of males and females with respect&#13;
to these variables. In addition, in the context of Thailand, Bangkok&#13;
plays a very unique role, and the migration flows involving Bangkok may&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
exhibit behavior quite different from those of the other regions. There-&#13;
fore, the models were also tested separately for Bangkok and non-Bangkok&#13;
migration.&#13;
The Relative Model&#13;
The simple formulation of the model to be tested is specified by&#13;
log M. = log k + a log P. + a log P    + alog Dij + a+&#13;
Uj            1     1     2g    i                           Iag.  a4o  ''*&#13;
a6log (U./U.) + a,3log (Fi/F1 ) 4 a10log (URi/UR.)&#13;
The results of this specification for total gross migration from i to j&#13;
are given in the first column of Table 1, and the results for females,&#13;
males, and a pooling of males and females are given in columns 2, 3, and&#13;
4.1-/ The first four c:olumns show that the model explains approximately&#13;
60 percent of the variation in each group, and that all variables are&#13;
statistically significant and of the hypothesized sign with the exception&#13;
of urbanization, which has the opposite sign. This would imply that ur-&#13;
banization per se is nct an attracting force once one controls for the&#13;
economic attractiveness of the changwat. This point will be explored more&#13;
fully later.&#13;
The gravity variables of population size and distanceL-J have the&#13;
greatest explanatory power as measured by beta coefficients (not shown),&#13;
followed by relative income, relative unemployment and relative proportion&#13;

of land farmed in that order.    The perverse urbanization variable has the&#13;
least explanatory power. Thus the purely economic variables perform at&#13;
a level between that oF the simple gravity model and the more impression-&#13;
istic taste for (or distaste for) urbanization.&#13;
Separate equations for male and female migration appear to be re-&#13;
markably similar in explanatory power and the size of the coefficients.L2/&#13;
Only for the relative availability of farmland is there much difference.&#13;
This is confirmed in column 5, where an interaction dummy variable for&#13;
which male equals 1 was multiplied by each of the explanatory variables.&#13;
None of the interactiorL terms is significant except that for farmland.&#13;
This coefficient indicates that males are significantly more likely than&#13;
females to migrate from areas of relatively high proportion land farmed&#13;
to areas of greater availability of farmland.&#13;
The Expanded Model&#13;
In this section, we shall address the question of whether conditions&#13;
in origins and destinations play a symmetrical role in determining migra-&#13;
tion. A first test of this question can best be addressed by running a&#13;
less restricted test of the basic model:&#13;
log Mij1 = log k + alog P   +           + aog Dij + a        I  + alog &#13;

The signs of the coefficents that would prevail if the variables have a&#13;
symmetrical role in origin and destination are shown in the margin of&#13;

In the expanded model, the adjusted R2's are slightly higher than&#13;
those in the relative model.  The gravity variables are all significant&#13;
(as in the relative model) and have the predicted signs. In addition,&#13;
the population coefficients are all close to one, as hypothesized. The&#13;
economic variables (income, unemployment, and farmland) are all signifi-&#13;
cant and of the hypotlhesized s'igns onl' in the areas of destination.&#13;
Urbanization in the destination is significant but has a negative sign,&#13;
opposite from that hypothesized by the city lights theory.&#13;
The coefficients of the economic variables in the regions of origin&#13;
are not all significan1., but when they are they have signs opposite to&#13;
what would be implied by the relative model. The signs for urbanization&#13;
in both the sending and receiving regions, when significant, are opposite&#13;
to those hypothesized. The interaction terms indicate that males are sig-&#13;
nificantly more likely than females to avoid destinations of high unem-&#13;
ployment and urbanization and more likely to leave areas with a high&#13;
proportion of land farmed and high unemployment.&#13;
A possible interpretation of the effect of the economic conditions&#13;
in sending and receiving areas is that while migrants flow to areas of&#13;
relatively better econcmic circumstances, more of those in changwats&#13;
with better than average economic circumstances can afford to move. 5/&#13;
This hypothesis has been suggested for Thailand by Chamratrithirong (1976)&#13;
and by researchers who have studied migration in other countries. -/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
This would imply that economic development will increase the overall level&#13;
of migration while differential levels and differential growth rates will&#13;
determine the direction of flow.&#13;
Push and Pull Factors in Migration&#13;
The gravity model of flows from i to j makes it somewhat difficult&#13;
to assess the differential importance of factors at origin and destination,&#13;
because it implicitly assumes that a joint decision is made about whether&#13;
or not to migrate and where to go. It may be, however, that these de-&#13;
cisions are more or less separate. Conditions at the origin might well&#13;
push people from a region, and it is only after such push factors trigger&#13;
migration that conditions in various destinations are reviewed to determine&#13;
where people go.&#13;
To further explore the effects of changwat characteristics at origin&#13;
and destination, two separate regressions were run. The total migration&#13;
to a changwat from all others was regressed on the characteristics of&#13;
that changwat. Then the total migration from a changwat was regressed on&#13;
the characteristics of that changwat.&#13;
The results for in-migration are as follows: -/&#13;
log M. = -9.39 + 1.02 log P. + 0.93 log I. -0.04 log U. -0.11 log Fj&#13;
(8.71)     3  (4.44)     J (0.29)      J (1.56)&#13;
2&#13;
-0.34 log UR.; r   = .54, N = 70&#13;
(1.77)      J&#13;
Of the economic variables, only income has a significant effect in&#13;
determining the total volume of in-migration. These results are virtually&#13;
identical for males and females.&#13;
The results for the province of origin are more interesting and have&#13;
2&#13;
a much higher R&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
log M. = -4.24 + 0.78 log P. + 0.25 log I. + 0.29 log U. + 0.32 log F. +&#13;
1          (12.33)    1   (2.23)     1  (4.21)     1  (8.82)&#13;
0.12 log URi; -2    .87, N = 70&#13;
(1.17)&#13;
The economic variables all have a significant relationship with out-&#13;
flow, and the signs are extremely interesting. Income is positively as-&#13;
sociated with outflow supporting the ability to afford migration hypothe-&#13;
16/&#13;
sis.-Unemployment, however, has a sign that conforms to the initial&#13;
hypothesis and has more explanatory power (a higher beta value) than in-&#13;
come. Thus the higher the unemployment in an area, the greater the out-&#13;
flow of migration. Even stronger is the relationship of farmland to out-&#13;
migration: the greater the proportion of land farmed, the greater the out-&#13;
flow. Again, the results are virtually identical for males and females.&#13;
Thus, the ability to afford migration hypothesis and the push fac-&#13;
tors of high unemployment and especially limited farmland explain the&#13;
level of out-migration from a changwat, whereas income seems of primary&#13;
importance in explaining the level of inflow.&#13;
It is interesting to note that the relative model of the specific&#13;
flows from i to j yields the best prediction of signs, while the absolute&#13;
model yields expected signs for the destination variables only but gives&#13;
slightly higher adjusted R2 's. But wvhen total levels of migration to&#13;
or from a changwat are examined, the characteristics of the origin have&#13;
a much higher explanatory power. This would seem to imply that migra-&#13;
tion levels are more a push than a pull phenomenon, but once in motion,&#13;
it is the characteristics of the potential destination relative to the&#13;
origin that determine where migrants will go.   This gives a clear policy&#13;
implication: if one wants to reduce migration, one must concentrate on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
the conditions at the origin, but if the only problem is where the mi-&#13;
grants are going, one must alter the characteristics of alternative des-&#13;
tinations.&#13;
Bangkok as a Special Ca_e&#13;
Although the anomalous effect of the characteristics of origin on&#13;
migration flows has a tentative explanation, the perverse behavior of&#13;
urbanization is more d:ifficult to explain. As mentioned earlier, if mi-&#13;
gration causes higher urbanization in the destination and lower in the&#13;
origin, any simultaneous equation bias that exists would tend to strengthen&#13;
the coefficients in the hypothesized direction and thus cannot explain&#13;
the perverse results.&#13;
Part of the explarnation for the unexpected behavior of urbanization&#13;
may result from the fact that Bangkok plays a unique role in migration be-&#13;
havior in Thailand. The Longitudinal Study has shown differences in the&#13;
characteristics of those who migrate to Bangkok and those who migrate to&#13;
other urban areas (Goldstein et al., 1974). These differences might well&#13;
be reflected in different relationships between origin and destination&#13;
characteristics in migration to Bangkok and to other areas. Bangkok&#13;
may cause statistical problems as well because it is very much an outlier&#13;
on urbanization. In 1970, for exampLe, 81 percent of its population was&#13;
urban, whereas Phuket, the next most urban area, was only 34 percent&#13;
urban.-/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
Therefore, to separate the effect of Bangkok from that of other&#13;
areas, the previous an,alysis was replicated first for all migration flows&#13;
in which neither origin nor destination was Bangkok, then for flows in&#13;
which Bangkok was either the origin or destination.&#13;
Table 3 shows the results for the relative model. The results for&#13;
the non-Bangkok areas are essentially the same as those for the total&#13;
sample, but the coefficients are less significant owing at least in part&#13;
to the smaller sample size (138 cases for Bangkok versus 4,556 cases for&#13;
non-Bangkok). In particular, unemployment and urbanization are not signi-&#13;
ficant. The interaction terms show that in Bangkok males are signifi-&#13;
cantly more likely thanl females to respond to the relative scarcity of&#13;
farmland.&#13;
In the expanded model, the non-Bangkok results are again identical&#13;
to those for the total sample in both sign and significance. In Bangkok,&#13;
in addition to the gravrity variables, unemployment and income at destina-&#13;
tion have significant coefficients with the hypothesized signs, but farm-&#13;
land at destination is not significant, contrary to all other results.&#13;
It seems reasonable that few people migrate to Bangkok for its farming&#13;
opportunities, but this result also implies that those leaving Bangkok do&#13;
not tend to go to areas of high farming opportunities.- v&#13;
It is also interesting to note that the proportion of land farmed&#13;
at origin has a significantly positive effect on migration. Although this&#13;
was hypothesized to be the case, the coefficient for this variable for&#13;
&#13;

the total and the non-.Bangkok sample is significantly negative. This re-&#13;
sult might mean that migration to Bangkok, more so than to other areas,&#13;
is the result of diminishing agricultural opportunities in the rural sec-&#13;
tor. Alternatively, it may be a statistical artifact resulting from com-&#13;
bining migration to and from Bangkok in the same analysis.&#13;
We can test these alternatives by separating the analysis of the&#13;
two migration streams to Bangkok. The following relationship is found&#13;
between the inflow and the characteristics of the sending areas.&#13;

Of the economic variables, only the proportion of land farmed in the send-&#13;
ing area is significant. This is further evidence of the role of scarcity&#13;
of agricultural opportunities in stimulating migration to Bangkok.&#13;
These results are quite similar to those found for in-migration for&#13;
all areas combined. One major difference between Bangkok and the total&#13;
sample, however, is that for the total sample there was no difference&#13;
between the determinants of in- and out-migration for males and females.&#13;
Separate equations for male and female migration into Bangkok, however,&#13;
show that although scarcity of land is significant for both males and&#13;
females, the effect of such scarcity on males is significantly greater.&#13;
The coefficient for females is 0.26; for males, it is 0.37. For the&#13;
total sample, the coefficient was 0.32 (.31 for females and .32 for&#13;
males).&#13;
V. SUMMARY AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS&#13;
As fertility rates continue to decline in Thailand, attention is in-&#13;
creasingly being turned toward an examination of migration as an impor-&#13;
tant feature of demographic change and one that will undoubtedly have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31-&#13;
a major impact on the individual and collective welfare of Thailand's&#13;
population in the fut:ure. The rapid and unplanned growth of Bangkok&#13;
has highlighted some of the major problems associated with large-scale&#13;
migration and stimulated the government to include explicit population&#13;
redistribution policies and programs in the Fourth National Economic&#13;
and Social Development Plan (1977-1981).&#13;
The multivariate analysis undertaken in this paper has identified&#13;
some important factors that were associated with migration to Bangkok&#13;
and to all other provinces in Thailand in the 1965-1970 period. The&#13;
analysis presented above indicates that:&#13;
(a) The usual gravity variables (population at origin and destina-&#13;
tion and distance between (hangwats) are of paramount impor-&#13;
tance, but ecDnomic determinants of migration are also highly&#13;
significant.&#13;
(b) Economic factors predominate over the attraction of urban areas&#13;
per se as determinants of migration.&#13;
(c) The economic conditions in areas of destination relative to&#13;
those in areas of origin have significant effects in the direc-&#13;
tion hypothesized: the higher the per capita income, the lower&#13;
the unemployment, and the lower the proportion of land farmed&#13;
in the destination relative to the origin, the greater the flow&#13;
of migration between areas,holding population size and distance&#13;
constant. The expanded model also indicates that migrants&#13;
move to areas of relatively high income, low unemployment and&#13;
easy availability of farmland.&#13;
(d) Male and female migration streams seem to respond to per capita&#13;
income and unemployment in the same way. Males, however, are more&#13;
responsive than females to the scarcity or availability of farmland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
(e) Migration to and from Bangkok, and migration to and from other&#13;
areas respond similarly to relative income and the availability&#13;
of farmland. In addition, the coefficients for relative&#13;
unemployment are very similar for Bangkok and non-Bangkok migra-&#13;
tion streams, but the significance level is lower, probably be-&#13;
cause of the smaller number of cases in the Bangkok sample.&#13;
Thus, it is clear that the relative model predicts significant signs&#13;
very well, and that economic factors are far more important than the at-&#13;
traction of city lights. The separate roles of push and pull factors&#13;
are less clear.  Characteristics in the areas of destination have signi-&#13;
ficant effects in the direction implied by the relative model, but charac-&#13;
teristics in the areas of origin play a more complex role. Although higher&#13;
income in areas of destination served as a drawing card-for migrants,&#13;
higher income in areas of origin served as a stimulus to out-migration,&#13;
because people in the poorest changwats may not have had sufficient finan-&#13;
cial resources to support a move. This implies that the ability to afford&#13;
migration plans an important role in mobility in Thailand.&#13;
The scarcity of farmland in the region of origin has an unclear ef-&#13;
fect except in migration streams involving Bangkok, where it is an impor-&#13;
tant push factor, especially for males. For migration streams not involv-&#13;
ing Bangkok and for the sample as a whole, farmland in the province of&#13;
origin shows different signs depending on the specification used. If&#13;
one looks at the total migration from a province, scarcity of farmland&#13;
is a highly significant push factor. However, in testing the expanded&#13;
version of the gravity model where the dependent variable is the flow be-&#13;
tween two provinces, weD find a greater flow of migrants from areas of&#13;
less land scarcity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
This anomalous result for farmland may result either from measure-&#13;
ment problems (farm opportunities are not well captured by the proportion&#13;
of land farmed) or from the fact that our modeling has not captured the&#13;
essence of the decision-making process. Unfortunately, to test more so-&#13;
phisticated models of migration decision making, individual rather than&#13;
aggregate data are needed.&#13;
These findings suggest several implications about the future course&#13;
of migration in Thailand and possible policies to cope with any undesirable&#13;
effects of population movements. There is reason to believe that Thailand&#13;
will continue its pattern of increasing migration as development proceeds.&#13;
The impetus for migration to Bangkok and other urban areas is likely to&#13;
increase as uncultivated arable land becomes more and more scarce. Over-&#13;
all, inequalities in the income distribution among changwats will continue&#13;
to draw migrants to more prosperous areas of the country.&#13;
Our analysis indicates that the usual recommendation of&#13;
rural development projects may not dliscourage migration to Bang-&#13;
kok or other relatively developed areas of Thailand. The effects of&#13;
rural development projects on migration are by no means unambiguous. -/&#13;
For example, mechanization of agriculture can result in an increased&#13;
standard of living for some rural residents, but it may also provide an&#13;
impetus to out-migration by simultaneously reducing the number of farm&#13;
jobs and augmenting the ability of farmers to afford migration. This&#13;
does not mean that the government should not pursue rural development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
policies,, but it is important to consider the possible differential effects&#13;
of employment: creationi versus income generation on migration.&#13;
In fact, measures to restrict further expansion of income and em-&#13;
ployment opportunities in areas of destination may be more effective&#13;
in curtailing undesirable population flows than efforts to develop rural&#13;
areas. This end could be accomplished, for example, by limiting increases&#13;
in minimum wages in Bangkok and other crowded areas and restricting de-&#13;
velopment of factories in congested areas. Measures of this type are&#13;
likely to be only part:ly successful, however, since a large proportion of&#13;
jobs available to migrants are in the service sector and are often not sub-&#13;
20/&#13;
ject to minimum wage regulation or other types of government controls.-O&#13;
Whatever migration-related policies and programs are ultimately&#13;
adopted, both the number of migrants and migration rates will probably&#13;
continue to increase. Therefore, it would be wise to try to project the&#13;
direction and magnitude of migration flows in order to adjust for such&#13;
changes in development plans. The relationships established in the mi-&#13;
gration regressions above can be useful in constructing population pro-&#13;
jections at the changwat level. Such projections can help in long-range&#13;
planning for the provision of public services and in establishing the need&#13;
for government programs for migrants.&#13;
The trend in migration in Thailand also highlights the neecl for&#13;
studies of the effects of migration on both origin and destination&#13;
areas. Present policies take into account some of the disadvantages of&#13;
migration, such as the strain on urban public services and the brain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-&#13;
drain from rural areas.  But little is known about the possible advan-&#13;
tages of population movements. To what extent do migrants act as cata-&#13;
lysts for the dispersal of modern ideas? Are remittance flows from mi-&#13;
grants a major factor in aiding rural development? This paper has con-&#13;
tributed to an understanding of the causes of internal migration in&#13;
Thailand, but much more must be known about the consequences of migra-&#13;
tion to reach a more complete understanding of population movement and to&#13;
provide more effective input into the policy-making process.&#13;

FOOTNOTES&#13;
1/  In 1970, there were 71 changwats in Thailand with an average population&#13;
of about 500,000 persons.&#13;
2/ Although the National Economic and Social Development Board has often&#13;
expressed the need. for population projections for individual changwats,&#13;
the production of such projections has been hampered by a lack of&#13;
reliable and timely data on fertility, mortality, and especially&#13;
migration at the changwat level.&#13;
3/  For example, it may be that areas of very low educational attainment&#13;
may be the ones with the greatest out-migration. But within those areas&#13;
it might be the most educated individuals who migrate.&#13;
4/ Net migration between regions is more difficult to incorporate in the&#13;
gravity models presented below since the dependent variable can take&#13;
on negative as well as positive values, and the gravity model requires&#13;
taking the log of the dependent variable.&#13;
5/ The importance of the "bright l:Lghts" hypothesis is stressed, for&#13;
example, in May and Skeldon (1977).&#13;
6/ These data include very little temporary migration, since the census&#13;
was a de Jure one and permanent residence was recorded as current&#13;
residence.. People away from home for several months were not counted&#13;
as migrants.&#13;
7/  Ihe measures of land farmed and unemployment are not ideal.    Theoretically&#13;
we would want to include a measure of land quality as well as availability,&#13;
but an adequate measure of quality could not be found. The unemployment&#13;
variable :Lncludes those waiting for the farm season. This variable is&#13;
highly negatively correlated with urbanization, but standard unemployment&#13;
rates are extremely low.&#13;
8/  For urbanization, which we expect to increase inflow and reduce outflow,&#13;
if the city lights hypothesis is correct, we would anticipate that if&#13;
migration is focused on urban areas, then migration would increase&#13;
the proportion urban in 1970 and the observed relationship between&#13;
migration and urbanization would overstate the effect of urbanization&#13;
on migration. For unemployment, which should reduce inflow and increase&#13;
outflow, if migrati:on increases unemployment at the destination and&#13;
reduces unemployment at the origin, the unemployment coefficients would&#13;
underestimate the effect of unemployment on migration.&#13;
9/ Between 1965 and 1970 only five percent of the population five years of&#13;
age and over moved across changwat boundaries.&#13;
10/ The "total," "male," and "female" regressions have 70 x 69 observations&#13;
on gross migration (less any migration streams that equal zero). The&#13;
pooled sample has twice as many observations, since both male and female&#13;
flows are included as separate observations.&#13;

urban migration." If the projects are employment creating, they may&#13;
reduce migration out of an area, but this possibility is only supported&#13;
in the total outmigration formulation and not in the directional analysis&#13;
of Tables 2 and 4.&#13;
20/ According to the Survey of Migration in Bangkok Metropolis (Thailand,&#13;
NSO, 1979), 43 percent of recent migrants working in Bangkok were employed&#13;
in service industries.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The models tested here are of the
            gravity flow variety. They are tested in two basic forms,
            one constrained and one unconstrained. It is very clear from
            this analysis that: (1) economic factors predominate over
            the non-economic attraction of urban areas; (2) the economic
            conditions in destinations relative to origins have
            significant relationships in the hypothesized direction; (3)
            male and female migration streams respond to per capita
            income and unemployment in the same way but males are more
            responsive to the scarcity or availability of farmland; (4)
            migration to and from Bangkok tends to respond in a very
            similar manner to relative income and the availability of
            farmland as migration to and from other areas; (5) in the
            unconstrained model, conditions in the area of destination
            all have significant relationships of the hypothesized
            signs; (6) conditions in the areas of origin play a far more
            complex role, since conditions at the area of origin
            determine not only the push to migrate, but also the ability
            to afford to migrate; (7) the sign and significance of other
            economic variables in the origin vary depending on the specifications.
