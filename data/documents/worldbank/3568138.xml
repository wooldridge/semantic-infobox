&#13;
&#13;
Macroeconomic Performance&#13;
&#13;
1.       Since the mid-l990s, Tanzania has made substantial progress inmacroeconomic&#13;
stabilization and structural reforms of the economy. At the beginning o fthe reform process,&#13;
economic growth was slow to gain momentum, but over the last five years or so ithas averaged&#13;
more than five percent. The positive development continued into 2002 when real gross domestic&#13;
product (GDP) grew by about 6.3 percent. As a result o f the impact o f the drought on agriculture,&#13;
real growth in2003 i s projectedat 5.5 percent.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Inflationremainedbelow five percent in2003. Annual inflationdeclinedto 4.4 percent at&#13;
end-2002 (from 4.9 percent in2001), but increased slightlyto 4.8 percent by February 2004, due&#13;
to food shortages.Non-food price inflation declinedrapidly from a peak o f 9.6 percent inJanuary&#13;
2003 to 0.6 percent by December 2003.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Higherreal growth inthe agricultural sector (which accounts for almost halfof GDP) has&#13;
been accomplished through the liberalizationof marketingstructures, as well as o f agricultural&#13;
prices and the foreign exchangeregime. Fiscal consolidationhas beencentral to the success in&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization. Insupport of Tanzania's reform program, donors have provided&#13;
sizable financial assistanceand this has almost eliminated the Government's domestic financing&#13;
needs. This has again led to lower interest rates and stimulated private sector growth.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Fiscal developments inFY2002/03 were characterized bybetter than projectedrevenue&#13;
performance, as well as higher-than-expected expenditure. Revenue exceededprojectionsby 0.3&#13;
percent of GDP on account of buoyant revenue from Value Added Tax and income tax. Total&#13;
expenditure exceededprojectionsby 1.2 percent o f GDP, due to a higher than projectedend-of-&#13;
year catch up inrecurrent expenditures and the upwardrevision o f development expenditures&#13;
financed with foreign grants. Through January o f FY 2003/04, revenue exceededprojectionsby&#13;
0.2 percent of GDP, as tax revenue continued to be strong, partly as a result of the&#13;
implementationo f measuresto curtail smugglingo fpetroleum imports, and the impact of strong&#13;
collections of income tax. Duringthe same period, actual expenditure was 0.9 percent of GDP, or&#13;
below projections, reflecting lower-than-programmed interest payments, as well as lower-than-&#13;
projectedforeign and domestically-financed development expenditure. InFebruary 2004,&#13;
Parliament passeda supplementary budget which covers additional drought relatedexpenditures&#13;
inthe power sector, for restockingthe strategic grainreserve, andfor the purchase ofanew&#13;
government aircraft. The additional expenditure o f about TShl87 billion is to be financed&#13;
through a combination of higher than budgetedprogram support inflows, lower than budgeted&#13;
debt service payments and from a drawdownofreserves from the BankofTanzania.&#13;
&#13;
5.       The discussion of the macroeconomic framework inthe last Poverty ReductionStrategy&#13;
ProgressReportpoints out that despite strong revenue performance, a major challenge remains to&#13;
raise the revenue to GDP ratio. The projectedmedium-term revenue targets are achievable, with&#13;
implementationo f a comprehensive strategy for reform o f tax administration andpolicy. Inthis&#13;
respect, the report notes appropriately the importance of eliminating exemptions, as well as of a&#13;
review of tax laws. To improve tax administration, the Government is reorganizing the Tanzania&#13;
Revenue Authority.&#13;
&#13;
6.       Through December 2003, the Bank o f Tanzania (BOT)maintained a tight stancewith&#13;
respect to monetary policy with a view to meetingthe established reserve money targets. Reserve&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TanzaniaEmergency Power SupplyProject              5&#13;
T e c h c a l Annex&#13;
&#13;
money and net domestic assets of the BOTremainedsignificantly below the December 2003&#13;
targets, as the BOTmore stringently enforced a standingrequirement for commercial banks to&#13;
expeditiously transfer to the BOTtax revenue heldby the Tanzania Revenue Authority inbank&#13;
accounts, and inaddition, actively engagedinopen market operations. As a result of these&#13;
actions, money supply growth at end-December 2003 remainedbelow projections bymore than 4&#13;
percentage points. The liquidity squeeze inSeptember2003 resultedinsome commercial banks&#13;
being unable to meet reserve requirements, and ledto temporarily highinterest rates on the&#13;
interbank market. InOctober 2003, the liquiditysituation loosenedas aresult of the BOT'S&#13;
injection of liquidityand a drawdownof deposits by the Government. Through December 2003,&#13;
credit to the private sector increasedby 43 percent, which was significantly above projections,&#13;
fueled inpart by increasedcompetition inthe banking system and the reduction ininterest rate&#13;
spreads.&#13;
&#13;
7.          Tanzania's overall balance o fpayments position improved in2002/2003 becauseof larger&#13;
inflows of donor assistanceand the impact o f debt reliefunder the Heavily IndebtedPoor&#13;
Country Initiative. However, the current account deficit, excluding officialtransfers, widened&#13;
slightly. There was a strong increaseinnon-traditional exports, mainly gold, combinedwith a&#13;
moderate improvement intraditional exports, reversing a declining trend. Through the first half&#13;
o f 2003/04, balance o f payments developments remainedinline with projections, as imports,&#13;
notably petroleum imports, acceleratedand export growth was inline with expectations.&#13;
International reserves substantially exceededprojections due to increasesof donor inflows and&#13;
exports ofnon-traditional commodities and services. The exchange rate against the US.dollar&#13;
depreciated to TShl110 per dollar by endJanuary, and has since remainedstable. Inreal effective&#13;
terms, it depreciated by about 2 percent, which combined with a modest recovery o f the terms o f&#13;
trade, improved the environment for exports. The exchangerate i s now close to what the&#13;
InternationalMonetary Fundhas estimated as an equilibriumreal exchange.&#13;
&#13;
8.           The Government has made further progress inimplementingreforms inthe public&#13;
enterprise sector. At end 2002, a concession for the Dar es SalaamWater and SewerageAuthority&#13;
was granted to a British-German consortium. Meanwhile, the financial position and managerial&#13;
capacity of TANESCO have continuedto improve following the introductiono f anew&#13;
management team inmid-2002. The sale of 49 percent o f Air Tanzania to South African Airways&#13;
was completed inNovember 2002. InDecember 2003, Government offered49 percent o f the&#13;
shares of the National Microfinance Bank for sale to an investor consortium ledby a commercial&#13;
bank and consisting o f micro-finance institutions. This will be followed by the sale o f a further&#13;
21percent o f shares to domestic investors.&#13;
&#13;
The 2003 Drought&#13;
&#13;
9.           In2003,boththelongrains(March-May) andtheshortrains(October -December)&#13;
failed inlarge areas o f the country. Data indicates that water inflows to the overall hydropower&#13;
system were two thirds of the average inflow over the past 25 years. The 2003 inflow to the&#13;
MteraReservoir, the most important reservoir inTanzania's hydropower system, wasjust 40% o f&#13;
the 60-year average inflow.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
10.       Imuact of the Drought on Food Security Followingthe poor longrains in2003, an&#13;
assessment was conducted by the Ministryo f Agriculture and Food Security inJuly in&#13;
conjunctionwith a multi-agency Food Security InformationTeam. The team identified47&#13;
districts, mostly inthe central and northern areas with apopulationof 2 million, as being inneed&#13;
o f food assistance, with a corresponding food assistancerequirement of 77,500 million tons. In&#13;
August 2003, the Government launched anappeal for food aid.&#13;
&#13;
11,       The situationas ofMarch2004 continuedto reflect the on-going impact ofthe 2003&#13;
drought. Harvestingof the 2003/04 short Vuli season cereal crops inthe bi-modal rainfall areas i s&#13;
almost complete. The overall outlook i s poor due to inadequaterainfall. Ina few of the highland&#13;
areas inthe Kilimanjaro Region, crops such as maize and beans were reported to be ingood&#13;
condition. The aggregate 2003/04 productiono f cereals has been forecast at about 4 milliontons,&#13;
or about 11percent below the previous marketingyear and 5 percent below the average for the&#13;
previous five years. Below normal rainfall has also affected pasture conditions and raisedalarms&#13;
concerning livestockproductivity, thoughrecent rainfall has raisedhopes for some recovery.&#13;
&#13;
12.       Reflecting low supply, maize prices continuedto rise inseveral markets, aggravating the&#13;
food-security situation. Sharp increasesinmaize prices were notedparticularly inthe southem&#13;
highlands and central Tanzania.&#13;
&#13;
13.       Serious food shortageswere reportedinseveralregions, includingDodoma, Shinyanga,&#13;
Singida, Manyara, Lindi, Coast andMorogoro. Also, there are pockets o f food insecurity in&#13;
Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Mwanza, Mara andTabora Regions, where crops failed due to&#13;
drought. The Food Security InformationTeam andWorld Food Programprioritized 24 districts in&#13;
10 regions to receive available food aid.&#13;
&#13;
14.       Impact of the Drought on the Power Sector. In2002, TANESCO generated 97% of its&#13;
grid-based electricity requirements from hydropower sources. (See Demand and Supply&#13;
Characteristics, paragraphs 18-20 for full descriptionofthe power system). Despite the poor&#13;
inflows in2003, TANESCO maintained a highlevel of hydropower generation through the first&#13;
halfof 2003, meeting 83% of the annual loadwith hydro power generation. The continuedhigh&#13;
level of hydro output in2003 was achieved by "mining" the Mtera reservoir. The effect was that&#13;
the Mtera reservoirwas severely depleted, and by the beginning of February2004, the reservoir&#13;
level was at 690.31meters above sea level, or only 0.3 lmabove the minimumlevelrequired for&#13;
generation'.&#13;
&#13;
15.       Evenwith the drawdown onthe Mterareservoir, TANESCO beganpurchasingelectricity&#13;
from the lOOMWIPTLPower Plant inJuly 2003 at a capacity factor of about 90%. TANESCO&#13;
had to postpone its capital works programto divert funds to cover the cost o f the additional&#13;
thermal generation. Followingthe poor (October-December) short rains in2003, the declining&#13;
reservoir level at Mtera forced TANESCO to negotiate with Songas, the private operator o fthe&#13;
Ubungo Power Plant, to operate two o f the refurbishedUbungo gas turbine unitson expensive Jet&#13;
A1 fuel startinginDecember 2003. Havingexhaustedits cashreserves, inNovember 2003&#13;
TANESCO requested financial assistance from the Government. Since then, the Government&#13;
provided a cashinfusiono f about US$43 million equivalent, o f which US$15 millionwas to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
`As of  May 3,2004 (effectively the endofthe rainy season), the reservoir level at Mterahadrisen to 2.76&#13;
meters above the minimumlevel. A level of 6.5 meters above the minimumlevel wouldbe requiredto&#13;
fully utilize the capacity ofthe Mtera andKidatuhydropowerfacilities.&#13;

Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
reconcile outstanding Government electricity accountsreceivable before 20022. Since December&#13;
2003, TANESCO has beenspending about US$8 millionper month(compared withmonthly&#13;
revenues ofUS$15 million) on imported Jet A1 fuel to run80MW at the Ubungo Power Plant&#13;
andto purchase energy from the IPTLPower Plant.&#13;
&#13;
 16.      Because o fthe depletiono f the Mterareservoir during2003, generation from the Mtera&#13;
and downstream Kidatu Power Stations will be limitedin2004. The overall contributionto&#13;
power generation from the hydro power plants in2004 i s expectedto meetjust 54% of the&#13;
demand, resultinginsubstantially higher-than-average reliance on thermal generation ifsevere&#13;
load-shedding i s to be avoided. Furthermore, TANESCO will start 2005 with a very low level o f&#13;
water inthe Mterareservoir. Inorder to replenishthe Mtera reservoir, heavy reliance on thermal&#13;
generation will continue through 2005 even under optimistic rainfall scenarios.&#13;
&#13;
 17.      TANESCO i s now unable to pay for fuel for the extra thermal generation that i s needed&#13;
to make up for the reducedhydropower output in2004, and there is a shortage o f thermalpower&#13;
generation capacity. About 36MW of new thermal power capacity isrequired inOctober 2004,&#13;
with a second36MW neededinearly 2005. Private financing is envisaged for the new thermal&#13;
capacity and negotiations with a private sponsor, Songas, are under way. The Govemment,&#13;
TANESCO and IDAhave mapped out the actions needed, including the proposed IDA support,&#13;
privately-financed new thermal capacity and measuresto improve TANESCO's revenues, aimed&#13;
at addressingthe emergency situation in2004 and ensuringthat no further emergency assistance&#13;
would berequired in2005.&#13;
&#13;
Status of the Power Sector&#13;
&#13;
18.       Demand and Supply Characteristics. TANESCO's peak demand o f 506MW occurred in&#13;
December 2003. During2003, a total of 3,066GWh was generated, with a monthly demand low&#13;
o f 233GWh inFebruaryand a highof 275GWh inDecember.&#13;
&#13;
 19.      TANESCO's interconnected grid system has an installedcapacity o f 773MW, of which&#13;
 557MW (70%) is hydropower. TANESCO has dispatched hydropower aheado f thermal&#13;
 generation because of the lower variable energy costs. Inanon-drought year, most of the&#13;
 electricity (97% in2002) i s generated from hydropower. The table below summarizes the&#13;
 characteristics o fTANESCO's existinggeneration plant. TANESCO also operates about 30MW&#13;
 o f thermal generation inisolatedareas not connected to the grid.&#13;

&#13;
20.      TANESCO's largest hydropower complex, the MteraandKidatuDams, i s on the Great&#13;
Ruaha River. The Mtera dami s the most important reservoir inthe power system providing over-&#13;
year storage capability. Also, it regulates the outflows to maintain the water level for the&#13;
downstream Kidatuhydropower plant. Thermal generation inTanzania currently relies on&#13;
importedHeavy FuelOil (HFO), Jet A1 (aviation) fuel and Automotive Gas Oil. Concerning&#13;
thermal generation, the Songo Songo gas infrastructurefacilities, supported under Credit 3569-&#13;
TA, are expected to be commissioned around July 1,2004, at which time the ownership ofthe&#13;
Ubungo Power Plant will be transferred to Songas (the private gas and power company) andrun&#13;
on indigenous gas insteadof Jet A1 fuel. In 1995, agreementswere also signed with private&#13;
Malaysian investors for the constructionof the lOOMW diesel IPTL Power Plant located at&#13;
Tegeta. InApril 1998 duringthe constructionphase, TANESCO issued anotice o f default to the&#13;
private investors because, inits view, project costs were inflated. After several rounds o f&#13;
negotiations when the differences between the partiesremainedunresolved, TANESCO submitted&#13;
the matter to the InternationalCenter for Settlement of InvestmentDisputes (ICSID) inNovember&#13;
1998. InJuly 2001, the arbitration panel issued its final rulingonthe case based on the evidence&#13;
that hadbeenpresented.As a result of the arbitrationproceedings, the final capital cost o f the&#13;
plant, for the purposes of calculation of the tariff, was reduced by 25 percent. The IPTL Power&#13;
Plant was subsequently commissioned inFebruary 2002 and operates on HFO.&#13;
&#13;
 21.      Govemment's Power Sector Reform Program. Power sector reformhas been on the&#13;
 Government's agenda for several years andmucho f the preparatory work has been completed.&#13;
 An electricity sectorreform act hasbeendrafted to facilitate the development andpromotionof,&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Tanzania EmergencyPower Supply Project           9&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
and increasedprivate sector participation in, the expansion of electricity services. The analysis of&#13;
possible market structureshas been completed and work i s on-going to define the market rules&#13;
and to establish a regulatory agency. The Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority&#13;
(EWURA)will beresponsible for the electricity, gas, water and seweragesectors.&#13;
&#13;
22.      Against this backdrop, there has been significant progress inimproving the performance&#13;
of TANESCO and ineffecting a financial turn-around inthe power sector, bothpre-requisites for&#13;
further privateparticipation. InMay 2002, NetGroupof SouthAfrica was awarded atwo year&#13;
Management Contract for TANESCO. The achievements o fthe performance basedmanagement&#13;
contract over the past 2 years have beensignificant (see paragraphs 25-28). Inview of&#13;
internationalmarket conditions, however, andthe need for further improvementsinTANESCO's&#13;
operational performance and its financial situationbeforesuccessful privatization would be&#13;
feasible, the Government has decided to extend the performance-based Management Contract for&#13;
around 3-5 years. The new contract would be basedonrevisedperformance incentives aimed at&#13;
reducing losses, increasing connections (after the emergency period), investing insystem&#13;
rehabilitation, and the functional unbundling(ring fencing) o f generation, transmission and&#13;
distribution. A decision on the timingfor launching private participationfor the concessioning o f&#13;
TANESCO would be basedon future internationalmarket conditions and completion o f&#13;
necessaryreforms.&#13;
&#13;
23.      Recognizingthat continuedsignificant Government subsidies for the power sector have&#13;
constrainedTanzania's poverty reduction agenda, the Government, with assistance from the&#13;
donor community including IDA, has laid out a 2-year plan to complete the transformation of&#13;
TANESCO from a recipient o f Government subsidy, to a commercial entity. The plan includes&#13;
extension o fthe Management Contract with appropriate incentives to achieve the performance&#13;
improvements notedabove, implementation o f a power sector debt restructuringplanto clean up&#13;
TANESCO's balance sheet inpreparationfor privatization, andtariff adjustments. A three month&#13;
extension to the existingmanagement contract has been granted to permit adequatetime to&#13;
formulate the scope andperformance benchmarks for the next phase of the 3-5 year Management&#13;
Contract.&#13;
&#13;
24.      Effective May 1,2004, TANESCO's Board of Directors approved a tariff increase of&#13;
4.3%, basedinpart on lowering the lifeline tariffblock from 100kwhto 50 kwhper month.&#13;
TANESCO will continue to review the level o f tariffs on a six monthbasis, andwill modify tariff&#13;
levels up to 5% bi-annually, which is withinthe authority of TANESCO's Boardof Directors. A&#13;
comprehensive tariff study i s proposed for financing under Credit 3569-TA. This study will&#13;
update estimateso f the longruncost o fpower supply, propose a mechanism for indexing o f&#13;
tariffs, and examine other measures(e.g. time o f day tariffs, a quota mechanismfor application in&#13;
the event of future supply shortfalls, and application of geographically differentiated tariffs), to&#13;
ensure that price signals to consumers encourage the efficient use o f electricity and that tariffs are&#13;
maintainedat a levelnecessaryto ensure financial sustainability o f the power sector.&#13;
&#13;
25.      TANESCO's Financial and OperationalPerformance and Prospects. Following a&#13;
competitive selection process, inMay 2002 the Government appointed NetGroup Solutions&#13;
(South Africa) to manageTANESCO under a two-year perfonnance-based management contract,&#13;
withTrust Fundsupport from the Swedish InternationalDevelopmentAssociation (SIDA). Under&#13;
the leadership o f the new management team andwith support from the Government,&#13;
TANESCO's operational and financial performance have improved significantly over the past&#13;
two years. Since May 2002: (i)    TANESCO's billing collectionrate (excluding settlement o f&#13;
prior Government arrears) improved from 76% to 92%; (ii)      staff numberswere reducedby 1,428&#13;
to 4,991 employees; (iii) TANESCOpaid down TSh33 billion of outstanding commercial debt;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
(iv) system lossesdeclined from 27% to 24%; (v) administrationand overhead costs were&#13;
reducedby about 20% andTANESCO has obtained more competitive prices from suppliers ;and&#13;
(vi) TANESCO hasanimprovedcredit rating inthe market, which enabledTANESCO to access&#13;
the domestic capital market. The resultingimprovements incash inflows enabled TANESCO to&#13;
finance: (i)  staff redundancy costs of TSh22 billion, (ii)efficiency improvement costs of TSh7.5&#13;
billion, and (iii) capital investments of TShl1.3 billion. NetGroup's efforts to train and empower&#13;
TANESCOstaffhave dramatically improvedmorale andproductivity. When the Management&#13;
Contractor first entered TANESCO, it was under police protection. Now, two years later with the&#13;
contract up for renewal, TANESCO staffhave publicly supported an extension.&#13;
&#13;
26.      System lossesremain at a relatively highlevel, inpart due to systemoverloadand lack o f&#13;
fundsto implementreliefprojects suchasreplacement offaulty meters. Itis plannedthat funds&#13;
available under Credit 3569-TA would be made available to address urgent distributionand&#13;
transmission constraints.&#13;

29.      Inspite oftheseimprovements, TANESCO's financial situationcontinues to beweak.&#13;
The 2003 drought had a negative impact onTANESCO's financial situationbecausethe cost of&#13;
imported fuel for thermal generation alternatives to hydropower has been very highcompared to&#13;
TANESCO's present tariff. TANESCO's current operational requirements cannot be met from&#13;
its presentrevenues. According to the latest estimates for 2004 under the probablehydro&#13;
scenario, TANESCO's cash shortfall at the operating level is expected to be around TSh23 billion&#13;
(US$20 million equivalent).&#13;

by 30% from US$0.095 per kwhin 1999, to US$0.066 per kwhin2003. This is highly&#13;
significant since 65% to 70% o f TANESCO's revenue requirements, even ina non-drought year,&#13;
are foreign exchange dependent. TANESCO's tariffneedsto be adjusted to correct the erosion of&#13;
tariffs over the past five years and narrow the gap between the cost of service andrevenues.&#13;
&#13;
31.      Further to the May 2004 4.3% tariff adjustment, TANESCO's fundingrequirements&#13;
duringthe 2004/05 periodwill haveto bemetthrough a combination ofmeasures, including: (i)&#13;

Government's Responseto PastDroughts&#13;
&#13;
32.      There have beenseveral major shortages of electricity inTanzania duringthe last decade.&#13;
In1994, TANESCOwas unable to supply about lOOMWofload, which was equivalent to about&#13;
one thirdo f maximum demand inthe interconnected system at that time. In 1997, TANESCO&#13;
shed about 50MW of load. Load sheddingo f about 30 percent or 90MW occurred again in&#13;
November and December 2000. Ineach case, load-shedding hasbeenprecipitatedbypoor&#13;
rainfallinTanzania's predominantly hydroelectric system, highlightingTanzania's over-reliance&#13;
on hydropower and inadequate or unaffordable thermal power generation. Initially, the&#13;
Government's responseto past droughts was to install thermal generation operating on imported&#13;
liquidfuel. About 37MW ofthermal generation was installedin 1994, anadditional 75MW of&#13;
thermal generation in 1995, and the 1OOMW IPTLthermal Power Plant was commissioned in&#13;
2002. However, the highcost o f energy charges from these plantsrelative to TANESCO's&#13;
revenues has limitedthe success o f this approach. The current emergency situation i s a case in&#13;
point: inaddition to a thermal capacity shortage, TANESCO is facing an energy shortage as it i s&#13;
unable to afford the cost o frunningthe Ubungo Power Plant gas turbines on Jet A1 fuel and the&#13;
energy charges from the IPTLPower Plant.&#13;

&#13;
33.       Recognizingthis over dependenceon hydropower, the Government undertookthe&#13;
diversificationo f Tanzania's electricity generation sourcesby soliciting private sponsors to&#13;
develop indigenous natural gas resource as part of the World Bank-assisted Songo Songo Gas&#13;
Development and Power Generation Project (Credit 3569-TA). The gas infrastructuresystem and&#13;
conversion of the Ubungo Power Plant to gas-firing i s scheduled for commissioning around July&#13;
1,2004. The availability o f gas will significantly reduce the energy charges for thermal power&#13;
generation and the consequentdrain on TANESCO's cash flow.&#13;
&#13;
The TANESCO/ GovernmentEmergencyPlanfor the Power Sector&#13;
&#13;
34.       When the October-December short rains in2003 didnot materialize, TANESCO&#13;
considered the potential sources o f generation shown inthe table below, together with their unit&#13;
costs, with the objective o fprocuring the least cost options to make up for the reduced&#13;
hydropower output expected in2004. The option of utilizingthe dead storage of the Mtera&#13;
reservoir for power generation at the downstream KidatuPower Plant was considered and&#13;
rejected since it has bothnegative environmental and longterm power generation consequences.&#13;

    * About   US$O.O7ikWh o fthis total amount i s the (variable) energy charge consisting o f variable operating costs&#13;
   and fuel. Inconsidering the least cost options for replacingreduced hydro output, it is the energy charge that is of&#13;
    interest, since the (fixed) capacity payment i s on a take-or-pay basis, and must be paid whether or not electricity is&#13;
   generated.&#13;
&#13;
35.       The TANESCO / Government planfor the remainder of2004 andearly 2005 is described&#13;
below3. Without a combination of all of these actions in2004 and early 2005, the emergency&#13;
situation could persist for a muchlonger period.&#13;
&#13;
          The IPTLPowerPlant willrunat maximumoutput untilgas becomes available inearly&#13;
          July 2004. Duringthis period, the gas turbines at the Ubungo Power Plantwould berun&#13;
          on Jet A1 fuel and would balance the generation shortfall. After commissioning o f the&#13;
          Songo Songo Gas Development and Power Generation Project (Credit 3569-TA)&#13;
          scheduled for aroundJuly 1,2004, the Ubungo Power Plantwill runon gas at maximum&#13;
          capacity utilization, and the IPTLPower Plant will make up the balance o f generation&#13;
          required;&#13;
&#13;
          Privately-financednew gas-basedthermalpower generation capacity will be&#13;
          commissioned inOctober 2004 andJanuary 2005, at which point the more expensive&#13;
          thermal generation plant (IPTL) will be dispatched last (see paragraphs 37 and 38);&#13;

&#13;
 37.      Part of the solution to the current emergency i s to install as quickly as possible new&#13;
 natural gas-basedthermal generation. This additional gas-fired generation i s also an important&#13;
 part of the planto mitigate against future droughts. TANESCO i s targeting commissioning of a&#13;
 gas turbine (36MW) at the Ubungo Power Plant by October 2004 and an additional 36MW gas&#13;
 turbine by January 2005. Boththese gas turbines are proposedto be financed, owned and&#13;
 operated by Songas, the private sector gas and power company established under Credit 3569-&#13;
 TA.&#13;
&#13;
 38.      Under the current contractual arrangementswith Songas (which has first right of refusal&#13;
 to install upto 60MW at the Ubungo Power Plant under project financing arrangements&#13;
 satisfactory to the Govemment), TANESCOhas requested Songasto finance and install two&#13;
 additional gas turbines (2x36MW) under open book arrangements. It is the intention of the&#13;
 parties to work within the existinglegal and commercial framework with regardto the existing&#13;
 Songo ContractualAgreements. As such, no additional credit enhancement (guarantees or&#13;
 increase inthe liquidityfacility) i s envisaged. Technical assistanceunder Credit 3569-TA is&#13;
 being providedto assist TANESCO and the Government to assessthe commercial bank financing&#13;
 arrangements for the 2x36MW units, including financing from the local market.&#13;

&#13;
 39.      Even with 2x36MW ofnew gas turbines inoperationby early 2005, the IPTLPower&#13;
 Plant will continue to be runat a highcapacity factor in2005. Giventhe impact o f the significant&#13;
 cost of runningthe IPTLPower Plant on imported fuel (approximately US$4.1 millionper month&#13;
 at a 90% load factor), the economic and financial assessment supports converting the existing&#13;
 10x1OMW medium speed diesel generators at Tegeta to natural gas-firing. The Govemment has&#13;
 requested IDA assistance for financing boththe conversioncost and the cost of extendinga gas&#13;

44.      Privatization and Private Sector Development Proiect (IDA Credit 3304-TA). In&#13;
September 2001, the Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform Commission (PSRC) awarded two&#13;
power sector consultancy contracts financed under Credit 3304-TA. Mercados Energeticos was&#13;
retainedto review andrecommend anew structure for the power sector, and to develop&#13;
appropriate trading arrangements and a regulatoryregime. The consultants' recommendations&#13;
includedthe unbundlingo fTANESCO into two distribution companies, three generation&#13;
companies and atransmission company. A SystemOperator and MarketAdministrator would be&#13;
locatedwithin the transmission company, with provisions to make it independent interms of&#13;
operational decisions and financial issues. Inrecognition o f the current investor climate andneed&#13;
to consolidate the gains from TANESCO's improvedtechnical and financial performance, in&#13;
early 2004 the Govemment decided to extend the existing performance-based management&#13;
contract for another 3-5 years, rather than pushingforward with full restructuring and&#13;
privatization inthe face o f the current low global investor interest indeveloping country power&#13;
systems. Inthe interim,the Management Contractor will establishring-fenced functional&#13;
business units within TANESCO, and undertake other efficiency improvementsincluding&#13;
necessarydistribution and transmission rehabilitation and reinforcement investments, as a prelude&#13;
to proceedingwith privatization.&#13;

&#13;
46.      A review ofthe existingIDAportfolio inthe power sector for Tanzania was undertaken&#13;
and the possibility o f usingsavings available under the Songo Songo Gas Development and&#13;
Power Generation Project (Credit 3569-TA) was considered. Use o f a portion o f these savings i s&#13;
proposed for the conversiono f the IPTLPower Plant to gas-firing. (See paragraph 39). However,&#13;
the preparation o f a stand-alone operationon an emergency basis, was deemed as a more&#13;
appropriate instrumentto support the Government's overall emergency power supply plan, for the&#13;
following reasons: InSeptember 2003, the Government had formally requested IDA to&#13;
restructure Credit 3569-TA insupport of urgentTANESCO transmission and distribution&#13;
rehabilitation requirements to prevent chronic system failures. A number o f technical/economic,&#13;
environmental/social and financial studies are currently under way inthis regard. While usingall&#13;
the cost savings to finance TANESCO's emergency power generation needscouldbeviewedas&#13;
efficient inthe short term, this would compromise system reliability inthe short to mediumterm.&#13;
Secondly, the cost savings were considered a means o f underpinning the power sector policy&#13;
dialogue on improving TANESCO's performance, industryrestructuring, financial restructuring&#13;
and establishing a functioning regulatory body.&#13;

                                    a&#13;
monitoring framework; and (iii)    the inclusionof mitigative measures to preventrepeated&#13;
disasters. These lessonshavebeentaken into account through a simpleproject design with few&#13;
contracts, rapid preparation and appraisal, completion o fbiddocuments and procurement&#13;
procedures, a dedicated implementationunit involvingTANESCO's senior management, and a&#13;
clear set o f mitigation steps to ensurethat futuredroughts do not leadto apower sector&#13;
emergency.&#13;
&#13;
Rationale for IDA lnvolvement&#13;
&#13;
48.      Without IDA'Ssupport, TANESCO would be unable to pay for fuel and emergency&#13;
generation capacity whichwould result insevere load-shedding and economic disruption.&#13;
Empirical evidence from previous load-shedding episodes inTanzania clearly demonstratesthe&#13;
significant negative economic impact o f severe load-shedding. Support from the donor&#13;
community was sought, and EIBindicated its interest to participateinthe private sector&#13;
transaction for financing o fthe 2x36MW gas turbines. Donors interested inthe energy sector&#13;
indicated their preference to fundinvestments rather than consumables like fuel. Other donors&#13;
indicated that they would continue to concentrate onproviding budgetary support basedon the&#13;
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper which focuses on the social sectors.&#13;
&#13;
Eligibility for ProcessingUnder OP/BP 8.50 on Emergency Recovery Assistance&#13;
&#13;
49.      According to the OPlBP8.50 on Emergency Recovery Assistance, the Bank considers the&#13;
criteria listedbelow indecidingwhether to provide an Emergency Recovery credit`loan. The&#13;
following paragraphs detail how the proposed Tanzania Emergency Power Supply Project meets&#13;
each o f these criteria.&#13;
&#13;
       Impact on economic priorities and investmentprograms. Without assistanceincovering&#13;
       the incrementalcost of imported fuel and energy purchases, there will be loadsheddingo f&#13;
       about 27% o f projectedenergy requirements in2004. The economic impact is estimated to&#13;
       be equivalent to as muchas 6% o f GDP. On a monthly basis, the level o f assistance&#13;
       requiredby TANESCO to avoid load-shedding would be about 8% of total monthly&#13;
       Government revenues. Since November 2003, the Government has provided a cash&#13;
       infusion of US$43 millionequivalent, o f which about US$15 millionwas to reconcile&#13;
       outstanding Government electricity accounts receivable before 2002. The Government&#13;
       will be providing anadditionalUS$23 million inbudgetary support for emergency&#13;
       assistanceduring2004. Without IDA support, there would be a need for further&#13;
       Government budgetary allocations which would result ina significant reductionin&#13;
       spending on other economic priorities and investmentprograms, including the poverty&#13;
       agenda. Support from the donor community was sought for the proposedproject, but has&#13;
       not been forthcoming.&#13;
&#13;
   0   Frequency. For recurring events, such as annual flooding a regular investment loan i s&#13;
       more appropriate. Though droughts do occur periodically inEast Africa, the situationin&#13;
       Tanzania is not an annual occurrence. While the availability o f water varies from year to&#13;
       year, water inflows into Tanzania's hydropower systemduring2003 and untilnow, were&#13;
       less than halfo f the annual 40-year average inflows. Data indicates that water inflows to&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Tanzania EmergencyPower Supply Project            17&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
       the overall hydropower system were two thirds of the average inflow over the past 25&#13;
       years. The 2003 inflow to the Mtera Reservoir, the most important reservoir inTanzania's&#13;
       hydropower system, wasjust 40% of the 60-year average inflow.&#13;
&#13;
   e   regular investment project may be preferable. In2003, boththe longrains (March - May)&#13;
        Urgency. For slow on-set disasterssuch as a drought, the more thoroughpreparation of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       rains in2003 been good, the impact of the March - May drought would have been greatly&#13;
       and the short rains (October - December) failed insome parts o f the country. Hadthe short&#13;
&#13;
       reduced. Hence the full extent of the emergency was only apparent at the end of 2003, and&#13;
       shortly thereafter the Government requestedemergency assistance fiom IDA.&#13;
&#13;
   e   Prospectsfor reducing hazardsfrom similar natural disasters in thefuture. The&#13;
       combination of: (i) availability of indigenous natural gas to replace expensive&#13;
                            the&#13;
       imported fuel; (ii) the installation of adequate gas-based thermal generation withinthe next&#13;
       year; (iii)revisedoperational practices to better managethe Mtera reservoir and the&#13;
       operations of other hydropower plants for optimal dispatch o f the mixedhydrokhermal&#13;
       system; and (iv) steps to improve the financial sustainability inthe power sector, will&#13;
       position the power supply systeminTanzania to withstand future droughts without&#13;
       emergency assistanceor severe load-shedding. All of these measures are to be addressed&#13;
       as part of the emergency operationand / or as part of the proposed restructuringof Credit&#13;
       3569-TA.&#13;
&#13;
   e   Expected economic benejh The major economic benefit o f the proposed project i s the&#13;
       avoidance of severe load-shedding and the consequentnegative impact on the overall&#13;
       economy and delivery o f social services. The project will benefitnot only electricity&#13;
       customers, but also those employed inthe formal and informal services who would lose&#13;
       jobs and income due to the economic impact o f significant power supply interruptions.&#13;
       Social service users will also benefit as apotentially major disruption to provision o f these&#13;
       services will be avoided.&#13;

Project Objectives&#13;
&#13;
50.      The proposed project would assist the Government inimplementingits emergency&#13;
measuresto avert a prolongedperiod o f severe load-shedding which threatens to cripple&#13;
economic activities and hinder the delivery of social services.&#13;
&#13;
Project Description&#13;
&#13;
51.      The proposedproject would provide funds to assist TANESCOandthe Government to&#13;
meet the incremental power supplycosts attributable to the 2003 drought. Itwould finance fuel&#13;
and energy purchasesto maintain power supply at a level sufficient to prevent a severe&#13;
contractionof the economy and inthe provision o f social services.&#13;
&#13;
52.      IDA'Sproposed financial contributionwould cover the following incrementalvariable&#13;
costs directly relatedto the drought: (i)  the fuel costs o frunningthe Ubungo Power Plant on Jet&#13;
A1 fuel throughearly July 2004 when the Ubungo Power Plantwill be commissioned runningon&#13;
indigenous natural gas; and (ii) the cost ofpurchasingelectricity (kwh)producedf?om the PTL&#13;
Power Plant operating on HFO through February2005. The combination o f the May 1,2004&#13;

&#13;
tariff increase, subsequentbi-annual tariff adjustments as necessary, the proposed IDA credit and&#13;
Government support through 2004, will ensurethat TANESCO will be able to generate adequate&#13;
power to avoid severe load shedding. The tariff projections take into account the need for&#13;
TANESCO to cover the capacity and energy payments for the proposed new 2x36MW to be&#13;
developed, constructed, commissioned and ownedby the private sector (Songas).&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 On-lendingArrangements&#13;
&#13;
55.      Because o f the emergency nature of this proposed project, as opposed to an investment&#13;
operation, the proposedIDA credit to the Government would beprovidedto TANESCO on a&#13;
grant basis, rather than being on-lent. Thejustification for this approach is that as a commercially&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Tanzania Emergency Power Supply Project           19&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
operating company, TANESCO would either load shedor charge a tariffto fully recover the costs&#13;
o f supplyingelectricity duringthe emergency. This would require nearlya doubling of the&#13;
present tariff which would not be affordable to consumers even over the short-term emergency&#13;
period. To avoid the negative economic consequencesof load shedding, the Government i s&#13;
providing assistanceto TANESCO to permit it to supply electricity at a level exceeding that&#13;
which would be commercially feasible. Onthis basis, repayment o f these funds would unfairly&#13;
penalize TANESCO. TANESCO would enter into a Subsidiary FinancingAgreement with the&#13;
Government, setting out the terms under which the Government will make the IDA funds&#13;
available.&#13;
&#13;
Benefits&#13;
&#13;
56.       The avoidance of severe load-shedding and the conseauent negative impact on the overall&#13;
economy and delivew of social services will directly benefit not only electricity customers, but&#13;
also those employed inthe formal and informal services who would losejobs and income due to&#13;
the economic impact of significant power supply interruptions. Social service users will also&#13;
benefit as a potentially major disruption to provision of these services will be avoided.&#13;
&#13;
57.       Maintaining the current momentumo f the power sector reformurogram. Both severe&#13;
load-shedding andmassive tariff increases(i.e. a surcharge to fully cover all additionalthermal&#13;
generation costs) couldjeopardize the sector reformprogram. Under the leadership o f the new&#13;
TANESCO management and with cooperation o f the Government, there have beensubstantial&#13;
improvementsinTANESCO's financial and operational performance inthe last 2 years. There&#13;
has also been a significant change inTANESCO staffperceptionof this first step inthe reform&#13;
process, as described inparagraph25. However, public support for the reformprocess,&#13;
 specifically the current and any futureprivate participationinthe power sector, couldbe&#13;
underminedifthere is the perceptionthat the reformprocess hasresultedineither huge load-&#13;
 sheddingor huge tariff increases.&#13;
&#13;
Risks&#13;
&#13;
 58.      Delays inExecution of the Government's Emergency Power Promam. There i s a riskof&#13;
 delays innegotiating with Songas, arranging the financing for, andinstalling and commissioning&#13;
 a 36MW gas turbine inOctober 2004 and the second 36MW gas turbine inJanuary 2005. To&#13;
mitigate against this risk,legal, technical andproject finance (merchant banking) assistanceto the&#13;
 Government andTANESCO is beingprovided underCredit 3569-TA. There i s also arisk of&#13;
 delays inconverting the IPTLPower Plant to gas-firing, thus continuingthe financial drain on&#13;
 TANESCO o fpaying for imported fuel. Legal andtechnical assistancewill also be provided to&#13;
 assist the Government and TANESCO inreviewing the contractual arrangements, securing the&#13;
 Government's interest inthe enhancedIPTL Power Plant and ensuring proper oversight o f the&#13;
 technical aspects o f the conversion. Finally, there is a riskthat there couldbe further delays in&#13;
 commissioning o f the Songo Songo Project gas infrastructure system. Intensive Songas&#13;
 management oversight and close monitoringbythe MEM's Project MonitoringUnit should&#13;
 mitigate against further slippages inthe commissioning date o f the gas processing plant, pipeline&#13;
 and Ubungo Power Plant runningon indigenous gas. Also, the project includes a contingency o f&#13;
 one additional monthof financing for Jet A1 fuel which would be available to TANESCO ifthe&#13;
 gas supply i s delayed through July.&#13;
&#13;
 59.      Continuationo fthe Emergency into 2005 due to Failure o f Government or TANESCO to&#13;
 Take RequiredSteus. The Government and TANESCO prepared a comprehensive emergency&#13;
 power supply plan andhave already taken anumber o f important steps to enable TANESCO to&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Tanzania Emergency Power Supply Project            20&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
transition out o f the emergency power supply phaseinto anormal planningmode (see paragraphs&#13;
34-42).&#13;
&#13;
60.      PotentialRemtational Risk. The IPTLPower Plant transaction was a deviation from the&#13;
least cost generation expansion plan and was the subject of international arbitration proceedings,&#13;
the outcome of which was a reductioninfinal project capital costs used inthe calculation of the&#13;
plant tariff, by about 25%. The proposedproject would finance energy purchases from this&#13;
thermal plant. Also, financing the conversion o f this plant from HFOto gas-firing is proposed&#13;
with savings from Credit 3569-TA (see paragraph39). Inthe current circumstances, the purchase&#13;
of electricity from this plant is the least cost option for meetingthe load. Onbalance, this&#13;
practical consideration outweighs considerations of the history o f the transaction. Furthermore,&#13;
the IPTLPower Plant will be inoperation, with TANESCO obligated to pay capacity charges for&#13;
the next 17.5 years. Thus, it makes economic and financial sense to reduce the costs of electricity&#13;
to energy users, by convertingthe plant to gas-firing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                      IV: STUDIESAND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
&#13;
61. The following studies and technical assistancewould be financed under Credit 3569-TA7to&#13;
support the Government's strategy for addressing the current emergency and for ensuring that the&#13;
power sector i s positionedto withstand future droughts without requiring emergency assistance&#13;
from the Government:&#13;
&#13;
    0    Once the gas infrastructure facilities are commissioned and adequate gas-basedthermal&#13;
         generation capacity ininstalled, TANESCO will revise its hydropower operating regime&#13;
         includingthe management o f the Mtera reservoir. This will includethe provisiono f&#13;
         technical assistanceand softwarekardware requirements.&#13;
&#13;
    0    TANESCO will retain a consultant to carry out a rapid assessment o fpractical electricity&#13;
         demand management measureswhich couldrealisticallybe implementedby TANESCO&#13;
         inthe short term.&#13;
&#13;
    0    A comprehensive tariff study isproposed. This study will update estimates ofthe long&#13;
         runcost ofpower supply, propose amechanism for indexingoftariffs, andexamine other&#13;
         measures (e.g. time o f day tariffs, a quota mechanism for application inthe event of&#13;
         future supply shortfalls, and application of geographically differentiated tariffs), to ensure&#13;
         that price signals to consumers encouragethe efficient use of electricity and that tariffs&#13;
         are maintainedat a levelnecessaryto ensure financial sustainability o f the power sector.&#13;

charge made up of fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs) producedby the IPTL&#13;
Power Plant, excluding any applicable duties, taxes and levies4.&#13;
&#13;
64.          Procurement of Jet A1 fuel will follow InternationalCompetitive Bidding (ICB)&#13;
procedures (allowing at least 15 days biddingperiod with publicationinthe nationalnewspapers,&#13;
the UnitedNations Development Business and dgMarket). The fifteen-day biddingperiod with&#13;
the publication innationalnewspapers, the UnitedNations Development Business and dgMarket&#13;
i s an exception, considering the emergency nature of this project. The two contracts under the&#13;
proposed project will be subject to IDA'Sprior review.&#13;
&#13;
65.          Tanzania has sufficient local fuel suppliers o f Jet A1 fuel with storage and distribution&#13;
capabilities, which can meet TANESCO's demand on emergency basis. TANESCO requires this&#13;
fuel untilJuly 2004, when the gas infrastructure system i s expected to provide gas for runningthe&#13;
Ubungo Power Plant. TANESCO confirmed that local fuel suppliers could supply any quantity&#13;
o f Jet A1 fuel, but on certain occasions some dealershave failed to meet quality interms o f&#13;
specifications, specifically elements such as sulfur and alkaline are sometimes found to be out o f&#13;
specifiedrange. TANESCO normally uses a laboratory of the Tanzania InvestmentResearch&#13;
Development Organizationto confirm the quality of the consignment. It takes a day to obtain the&#13;
results, and the cost of these tests i s sharedequally between the supplier and TANESCO.&#13;
&#13;
66.          Onthe basis ofthe formal procurement capacity assessmentconducted duringproject&#13;
appraisal, TANESCO has acceptableprocurement capacity, andthus the procurement risk for this&#13;
project i s consideredto be average. A procurement plan for the project executionperiod (through&#13;
February2005) was discussedandreviewedby IDA. Audits ofprocurement anddisbursementof&#13;
IDA funds will beundertakenon amonthly basis by internalauditors. Externalaudits ofthe&#13;
project accounts will be undertaken after 4 months from credit effectiveness and at the&#13;
completion o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
&#13;
67.          The project completion date is February28, 2005 andthe closing date is August 31,&#13;
2005. IDA will disburse against eligible payments upto the allocation of the CreditProceeds&#13;
limit specifiedinSchedule 1ofthe Development Credit Agreement. All applications to withdraw&#13;
proceeds from the Credit Account will be fully documented.&#13;
&#13;
68.          To facilitate disbursements under the project, TANESCO will establish a Special&#13;
Account with an authorized allocation o f US$4.5 million.&#13;
&#13;
69.          Ifthe water levelintheMteraReservoirweretoreach696.5 metersabove sealevelat&#13;
any point intime duringthe execution o f the proposedproject, the emergency power situation&#13;
would be deemed to have ended, and disbursements of IDA funds to addressthe emergency&#13;

FinancialManagementAssessment,Auditing andReporting Requirements&#13;
&#13;
70.      Accounting Systems,Policies and Procedures. TANESCO's financial management&#13;
systemhas been designedto support management inits deployment o f resources to ensure the&#13;
efficient and effective applicationof these resourcesinthe delivery of outputs and inthe&#13;
achievement o f desired outcomes. Dueto the nature of the transactions andthe emergency nature&#13;
of the proposedproject, monthly FinancialMonitoring Reports would be prepared andwould&#13;
integrate project accounting, procurement, contract management, disbursements and the audit of&#13;
physicalprogress under each o f the contracts.&#13;
&#13;
71.       Management Reporting (Financial Monitoring Reports). Monthly management reports&#13;
would beproducedand would serve as Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) requiredby IDA.&#13;
They will be subject to internal audit on a monthly basis. The contents of these reports would&#13;
cover the followingaspects: FinancialReports (Sources andUses of FundsbyFundingSource,&#13;
Uses of Fundsby Project ActivityKomponent); a PhysicalProgress (Output Monitoring) report;&#13;
and a Procurement and Disbursementreport. Duringnegotiations, IDA reviewed and agreedwith&#13;
TANESCO the format and content of the FMR, which will also serve as the monthly progress&#13;
report.&#13;
&#13;
72.      TANESCOEntity Financial Statements. The Tanzanian Companies Ordinance, (CAP&#13;
212) requires companies to prepare its financial statementswithin six months after the financial&#13;
year-end and inaccordancewith Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (which inter alia&#13;
includes the application o fthe accrual basis o frecognition of transactions). TANESCO will&#13;
submit its audited entity financial statementsto IDAwithin six monthsafter the endof the&#13;
financial year.&#13;
&#13;
73.      Project Financial Statements. Because of the short duration o f the proposed project,&#13;
TANESCO has agreedto submit a set o f audited interim project financial statementsfor the first&#13;
4 months o f the project, and a final set of audited project financial statements for the entire period&#13;
o f the project, within45 days after the end of the respective reporting dates.&#13;
&#13;
74.      Internal Audit. An InternalAudit Directorateexists at TANESCO headquarterswith&#13;
independent dual reporting to the Managing Director and respective auditees. The Internal Audit&#13;
Directoratehas sufficient capacity and i s well staffed. To improve quality andtimeliness of&#13;
follow-up, responsesto audit queries are requiredto be submitteddirectly to the Managing&#13;
Director. The Internal Audit Directorate concentrateson corporate governance and testing&#13;
compliance with financial regulations. The Director of Internal Audit would be responsible for&#13;
ensuring that the monthly FMRs are subjected to internal audit and that the report will be&#13;
providedto the Managing Director within 30 days subsequent to eachmonthly reporting date, and&#13;
copiedto IDA.&#13;
&#13;
75.      ExternalAudit. The external audit for boththe TANESCO entity financial statementsas&#13;
well as the Project Financial Statements, will be carried out by PriceWaterhouseCoopers,&#13;
TANESCO's current appointedauditors. TANESCO will have its entity financial statements&#13;
audited within six months after the end o f the financial year. Two audits will be carried out on&#13;
the Project Financial Statements, namely four months after the project has become effective and&#13;
another one at the endo f the project. Due to the nature o f the proposed project, these audit&#13;
reports would be required within45 days subsequentto the reportingperiods. This means that&#13;
the normal legalrequirement o f IDA for submission ofthe audit report within six months of the&#13;
endofthe financial year will not be applicable. The costs incurred for the audit will beborneby&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Tanzania Emergency Power Supply Project             24&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
TANESCO through its normal operating budget. Duringnegotiations, the terms ofreference for&#13;
the external auditor were discussedand agreed.&#13;
&#13;
76.      FinancialManagement Risk. An evaluation o fTANESCO's financial management&#13;
system was undertaken, and indicates that the financial management arrangements for the&#13;
proposed project would satisfy IDA'Sminimumrequirements. Hence, the project financial&#13;
management riski s assessedas beingnegligible.&#13;
&#13;
Retroactive Financing&#13;
&#13;
77.      The proposed credit would provide for retroactive financing inthe amount of US$8.8&#13;
million, equivalentto 20% of the proposed credit amount, to finance fuel and kWhexpenditures&#13;
incurredbefore effectiveness of the proposed credit.&#13;
&#13;
Environmental and SocialImpact&#13;
&#13;
78,      An environmentalaudit ofthe project sites hasbeen completed byTANESCO, for which&#13;
Terms of Reference were reviewedand approvedby IDA'. TANESCO has built up its capacity&#13;
to undertake environmental audits and environmental impact assessments and has carried out&#13;
similar assessments for SIDA. The objectives of the environmental audit are to assist the&#13;
Government to determine the environmental liabilities and the need for remedial actions&#13;
necessaryto bringthe facilities into compliance with Tanzanian Law andWorld Bank Safeguard&#13;
Policies and environmental guidelines, and to protect the healtho f workers and the general public&#13;
livinginthe area andthe environment. There i s no resettlement since theproposedproject&#13;
involves existing generation sites. The sites impactedbythe proposed project include: (i)          the&#13;
IPTLPower Plant (100MW); and (ii) UbungoPower Plant (112MW), bothlocated inthe&#13;
                                          the&#13;
outslurts o f Dar es Salaam. An Environmental ImpactAssessment and EnvironmentalAudit have&#13;
already been carried out at the Ubungo Power Plant under Credits3569-TA and 2489-TA, and a&#13;
summary of air quality monitoringi s preparedmonthly by Songas. Similarly, reports on the&#13;
environmentalaspectsof the IPTLPower Plant, including air emissions, are prepared periodically&#13;
byTANESCO. TANESCO's environmental unithas carriedout the environmentalaudit, which&#13;
has beenreviewed and found satisfactory to IDA. The draft Environmentalaudit was issued to&#13;
the InfoShop on May 7,2004 and has beenmade available inTanzania at TANESCO's Corporate&#13;
Headquarters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   VI: FINANCIAL AND ECONOMICJUSTIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Severe Load-Shedding&#13;
&#13;
 79.     Without assistance incovering the cost of importedfuel and energy purchases,&#13;
TANESCO would load shed about 891 GWhduringMarch-December 2004, equivalent to about&#13;
27% ofprojected energy requirements in2004, or US$55 million inlost revenues to TANESCO.&#13;
Byone estimate, the cost ofthis unservedenergy to the economy couldbe as highas US$550&#13;
million, or 6% of GDP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
* At thetime of undertaking the Environmental Audit, the possibility of including diesel generators, to be&#13;
leasedfrom Geita Gold Mining Ltd. and installed at TANESCO's Mwanza site, was under consideration&#13;
and an assessmentof the Mwanza site was included inthe Environmental Audit. Since then, based on a&#13;
review o f the hydropower situation it has been determined that leased generationat Mwanza will not be&#13;
needed. Hence, financing for t h ~ component has been dropped from the proposedproject.&#13;
                                   s&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Tanzania Emergency Power Supply Project           25&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
80.      Although it i s difficult to determine exactly the cost of unservedenergy, there is&#13;
empirical evidence from Tanzania to show the impact of load shedding due to previous droughts.&#13;
For example from the 1994Economic Survey, it is documented that there was a 3.8% decline in&#13;
industrial growth mainly becauseof electricity shortages and subsequentloadshedding that&#13;
started inSeptember 1994. Itwas also notedthat other services such as hotels, hospitals, and&#13;
shops were adversely affected and forced to buy diesel generatorsto meet their demands. In 1997,&#13;
the overall rate of economic growth dropped to 3.3% from 4.2% inthe previous year, on account&#13;
o f electricity shortages. Recent surveys (including the draft 2004 Investment Climate&#13;
Assessment), indicate that inadequate electricity supply i s already one o f the major constraints&#13;
faced by industryinTanzania and is also a major impediment to the start-up of new businesses.&#13;
It is clear that load shedding on the scale projectedwithout IDA support would have a very&#13;
negative impact on the economy.&#13;
&#13;
FinancialImplications&#13;

                                 MethodologyandAssumptions&#13;
    For CalculatingIncrementalThermalEnergyRequirementDueto the 2003 Drought&#13;
&#13;
A1.l TANESCO and IDAtogether developed a model to estimate the additional thermal&#13;
electricity generation that would be requiredin2004 and 2005 as aresult of the impact of the&#13;
2003 drought. This "incremental energy requirement due to drought" is defined as electricity&#13;
from thermal generation that would berequired, over and above the thermal generation that&#13;
TANESCO would require givennormal hydrology and normal hydropower output.&#13;
&#13;
A1.2     Data was obtained from TANESCO's records and usingTANESCO's SYSIMmodel.&#13;
Basedonhydrological data for the 1980-2003 period, it was agreedthat the inflow data for 2001&#13;
and 2002 fairly represent `normal', non-drought inflow patterns inTanzania's hydropower&#13;
catchment areas. Basedupon this inflow data, the average energy actually generatedmonthby&#13;
month from the hydropower plants in2001 and 2002 fairly represents the energy that could be&#13;
expected from hydropower generation inanormal, non-droughtyear.                            *&#13;
&#13;
Al.3     Figure Al.1shows thisnormal hydropower generation, as defined above, as aportion of&#13;
the actual total electricity demand in2003. The difference betweenthe normal hydropower&#13;
output and the total demand is met by thermal generation, primarily from the IPTLPower Plant&#13;
with a small contribution from a generator at amine feeding the main grid. The combinationof&#13;
the IPTL and other thermal generation i s the level of thermal generation (i.e. the number of GWh&#13;
each monthproduced from thermal power plants) that would be expected ina normal, non-&#13;
drought year.&#13;
&#13;
A1.4     FigureA1.2 shows the actual hydropower generation in2003 as a fraction ofthe actual&#13;
total electricity demand in2003. Comparing these two graphs, it is apparent that in2003 there&#13;
was lesshydropower generation andmore thermal power generation than inanon-drought year.&#13;
This is demonstrated bythe larger contributionfrom the IPTLPower Plant, andthe addition of&#13;
two additional sources of thermal generation - grid-connected diesel (diesel) generation and the&#13;
operationof two of the Ubungo Gas Turbines on Jet A1 fuel (GT Jet fuel) - inDecember 2003.&#13;
Interestingly, the number of GWhgeneratedfrom hydropower in2003 i s only slightlylower than&#13;
ina `normal' year. The effect ofmaintainingarelatively highoutput fromhydropower despite the&#13;
2003 drought was that the Mtera reservoir was fully depleted over the period. By the endof 2003&#13;
the reservoirlevel was within centimeters o f shut-down level.&#13;
&#13;
Al.5     The poor finishto 2003 interms o f water reserves inthe Mtera reservoir inevitably meant&#13;
that TANESCO began 2004 with a greatly reduced potential for hydropower generation from&#13;
Mteraandthe downstream KidatuPower Plant. Figure A1.3: "Emergency Power Generation&#13;
Plan-Total Generation Requirement" shows the projected generation, by source, that would be&#13;
requiredto meet the demand in2004. Note that the hydropower generation i s significantly lower&#13;
than that for a "normal" year, reflecting the fact that output from Mtera and the downstream&#13;
Kidatuwill be limitedbecause of the low starting level o f the Mtera Reservoir.&#13;
&#13;
Al.6     FigureAl.3 shows the IPTLPower Plant (IPTL) runningat maximumoutput inthe first&#13;
halfo f the year, untilgas becomes available inearly July 2004. UntilJuly, the gas turbines at the&#13;
Ubungo Power Plant will balance the shortfall runningon Jet A1 fuel (GTJet fuel), with a small&#13;
contribution from grid connected diesel (diesel) generation. After commissioning o f the Songo&#13;
Songo Gas Development and Power Generation Project (Credit 3569-TA) scheduled for around&#13;
July 1,2004, Songas will assume ownership of the gas turbines at the Ubungo Facility. These&#13;
four existing gas turbines will runonnatural gas (GT Gas) at maximumcapacity utilization, and&#13;
the IPTLPower Plant will make up the balance. The figure shows that by October, maximum&#13;

output fi-om IPTLand the four existing Songas gas turbines wouldbe insufficient to meetthe&#13;
demand as hydropower output falls off duringthe dry season. TANESCO i s targeting&#13;

inOctober 2004.&#13;

Emergency" shows the impliedincremental thermal power generation for 2004 - i.e. the&#13;
         Figure Al.4 "Emergency Power Generation Plan-IncrementalRequirement Due to&#13;
&#13;
difference betweenthe thermal power generation requirement to meet the actual load, and the&#13;
thermal generation that would havebeenrequired ina normal rainfall year. The proposed IDA&#13;
Emergency Power SupplyProjectwould finance the incrementalthermal generation from the&#13;
IPTLPower Plant, andJet A1 fuel for the incrementalpower generation from the gas turbines&#13;
runningon Jet fuel.&#13;
&#13;
Al.8     A similar approachwas usedto project the incrementalthermal energy requirementsfor&#13;
2005. These projections show the need for a secondnew 36MW gas turbine inJanuary 2005.&#13;
Boththese additional gas turbines are proposed to be financed, owned and operated by Songas,&#13;
theprivate sector gas andpower company, established under Credit3569-TA. Evenwith&#13;
2x36MW ofnew gas turbines inoperation inearly 2005, the IPTLPower Plant will continue to&#13;
be runat a highcapacity factor in2005, inorder to allow the Mterareservoir to recover. Given&#13;
the impact o fthe significant cost o frunningthe IPTLPower Plant on imported fuel&#13;
(approximately US$4.1 million per month at a 90% load factor), the economic and financial&#13;
assessment supports converting the existingWartsila 38 lOxlOMW mediumspeeddiesel&#13;
generators to naturalgas-firing. Once the additional 2x36MW gas turbines have been installed,&#13;
one by one the generating units o f the IPTLPower Plant would be taken off-line for conversionin&#13;
a phasedmanner, to avoidreducing available capacity below a levelneededto meet demand.&#13;

            Tanzania - Emergency Power Supply Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Emergency Power
            Supply Project is to assist the Government implement its
            emergency measures to avert a prolonged period of severe
            load-shedding, which would cripple economic activities, and
            hinder the delivery of social services. The project will
            provide funds to cover the incremental power supply costs,
            attributable to the 2003 drought. Specifically, the
            International Development Association's (IDA) financial
            contribution, will cover the incremental costs of fuel for
            running the Ubungo Power Plant on Jet A1 fuel through July
            2004, when the Plant will be commissioned to operate on
            indigenous gas, and, the costs due to the purchase of
            electricity produced from the Independent Power Tanzania
            Ltd. (IPTL) Power Plant, operating on heavy fuel oil,
            through February 2005. Given the circumstances, the project
            will assist in avoiding severe load-shedding, and the
            consequent negative impact on the overall economy, and
            delivery of social services. This will benefit not only
            electricity customers, but also those employed in the formal
            and informal services, who would otherwise, lose jobs and
            income due to the economic impact of significant power
            supply interruptions. Moreover, the project will help
            maintain the current momentum of the power sector reform
            program. Both severe load-shedding, and massive tariff
            increases (i.e., a surcharge to fully cover all additional
            thermal generation costs) could jeopardize the sector reform program.
