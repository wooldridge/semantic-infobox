A. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Housing and Municipal Service Allowance Program&#13;
1.    The present govermnent moved to increase housing rents and municipal service tariffs and&#13;
improve recovery of service delivery costs as part of its economic reform program. The Government&#13;
issued Cabinet of Minister's Decree No. 733 in October 1994 increasing tariffs for housing, water&#13;
and sewerage, hot water, heating and gas in stages in order to improve recovery of production costs&#13;
to 20% immediately and eventually to 60% by July 1995. Implementation of the decree has been&#13;
delayed somewhat but the Government moved to implement 60% cost recovery in January 1996. The&#13;
Government is scheduling further rents and tariffs increases to reach 80% cost recovery in September&#13;
1996 and 100% in January 1997. This was the first step in dismantling a system of direct&#13;
government assistance to housing maintenance enterprises (Zheks) and water, heat and other&#13;
municipal service enterprises and reducing these enterprises reliance on the government budget.&#13;
2.    The rapid increase in cost recovery is not sustainable without some measures to protect the&#13;
poor who could not afford to pay. Housing and municipal services were highly subsidized under&#13;
central planning. Households generally paid less than 5% of monthly income for housing and&#13;
municipal services (compared to close to 30% in market economies). President Kuchma in his speech&#13;
to the legislature introducing the economic reform program stated that people should have to pay no&#13;
more than 15% of their income for housing and municipal services.&#13;
3.    The Government introduced the Housing and Municipal Service Allowance Program&#13;
(HMSAP) in February 1995 (through Cabinet of Ministers Decree No. 89, issued on February 4,&#13;
1995) which allowed families whose monthly payments for housing, housing maintenance, water and&#13;
sewerage, hot water and heating, and garbage and liquid waste collection, exceeded 15% of monthly&#13;
income to apply for an allowance equal to the difference. Subsequently, the costs of liquid and solid&#13;
fuels and electricity were included. This is a key step in that it moves the government away from&#13;
providing budgetary assistance directly to producers but shifts assistance to the consumer. The&#13;
program is targeted towards the poor: i.e. a poor family will receive more government assistance&#13;
compared with a more affluent family with the same housing and municipal service costs (because&#13;
housing and municipal service payments will account for a larger proportion of a poor family's&#13;
monthly income). It was reviewed positively as part of the social safety net analysis under the&#13;
Ukraine Poverty Assessment (Report No. 15602-UA) completed in June 1996.&#13;
4.    HMSAP started implementation in May 1995 when 754 administrative offices were opened&#13;
nationwide to receive and process applications. The Ministry of Social Protection (MSP) is&#13;
responsible for HMSAP and oversees the program through regional (oblast) Social Protection&#13;
Departments; the HMSAP administrative offices are under the jurisdiction of the local governments'.&#13;
Under the program, families are required to provide documentation on incomes and monthly&#13;
payments for housing and municipal services to their local administrative office. When the documents&#13;
are processed, a family's monthly payments are adjusted so that they only pay 15% of income and the&#13;
difference (between the family's reduced payment and the original bill) is paid by the local&#13;
government to the Zheks and other municipal service enterprises. As of March 1996, 3.2 million&#13;
households had been granted allowances averaging Krb 3.0 million (about US$16) per month per&#13;
household.&#13;
1/ The local HMSAP administrative offices are subordinated to the local government (district) and the Ministry of&#13;
Social Protection. This reflects the fact that local governments in the Former Soviet Union were defacto local arms&#13;
of the national government. Although separate, the sector departments within the local governments maintain strong&#13;
links with the mother agency in the national government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
5.    The number of participants in HMSAP is expected to grow as the cost recovery for rent and&#13;
municipal services is increased during 1996. The number of applicants has increased significantly&#13;
following the increase in rents and tariffs in January 1996. The number of households granted&#13;
allowances every month has increased from around 150,000 per month between May and September&#13;
1995, to about 290,000 between October 1995 and January 1996, to 670,000 in February 1996 and to&#13;
830,000 in March 1996. It is estimated that 4.6 million families may be enrolled in the program by&#13;
October 1996, an increase of 1.4 million families (or 44%) following the anticipated increase in the&#13;
rents and tariffs in September 1996.&#13;
6.    The HMSAP administrative offices will be hard pressed to cope with the increase in&#13;
applicants and participants. Although some offices have started to automate the processing (with&#13;
computers obtained through USAID or acquired with their own funds), most administrative offices&#13;
process applications manually. Already there is widespread dissatisfaction with the amount of&#13;
documentation required, the cumbersome bureaucracy and time required to apply for and receive the&#13;
allowances. In addition, the subsidies need to be recalculated every time there is an increase in rents&#13;
or tariffs. The HMSAP administrative offices are required to submit reports to the Ministry of&#13;
Finance and the Ministry of Statistic but these are submitted late since they are produced manually.&#13;
The Government is proposing to address these issues through simplification of the application process&#13;
and automation of administration.&#13;
7.    USAID, through their consultants, has been active in assisting the Government develop the&#13;
HMSAP. They have been involved with the Cabinet of Ministers, MSP and the State Committee on&#13;
Housing and Municipal Economy in the design and monitoring of the program. Pilot efforts to&#13;
computerize the administration of the program have been carried out in several local HMSAP&#13;
administrative offices and the necessary software developed and transferred to the government.&#13;
USAID assisted the government carry out the overall assessment of their computerization needs and is&#13;
providing some (but not all) of the required equipment.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
8.    Housing and municipal pricing reform is critical to Bank operations in Ukraine. Rationalizing&#13;
public expenditures and improving the efficiency of public service provision is a key element in the&#13;
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy. The Bank is carrying out projects in housing (Ukraine Housing&#13;
Project - Loan 3985-UA, approved in March 1996) and is proposing projects in water supply and&#13;
sewerage, heating and urban transport. Increased cost recovery for these (and other municipal&#13;
services) is essential if the service providers are to achieve financial autonomy and if prices are to be&#13;
used to reflect consumers' willingness to pay and provide suppliers with incentives to reduce waste&#13;
and improve efficiency in service delivery. Incomes will not be increasing as rapidly as the rents and&#13;
municipal services prices. HMSAP is critical if the government's housing and municipal service&#13;
pricing reforms are to be sustainable.&#13;
9.    The Bank is encouraging the government to move assistance from direct budgetary support of&#13;
housing maintenance enterprises, water supply enterprises and other municipal service providers to&#13;
assistance targeted towards the poor. Some government assistance is needed to assist low income&#13;
households meet shelter, water and other basic needs. This can be better achieved through programs&#13;
targeted to the poor and linked to a family's ability to pay. HMSAP is a move in this direction.&#13;
Bank involvement with the program will provide an opportunity to further the dialogue with the&#13;
government on developing a social safety net in Ukraine.&#13;
10.   Finally, time is of essence. The number of HMSAP applications and hence program&#13;
participants are expected to increase significantly during 1996 and 1997 if the government proceeds to&#13;
increase rent and municipal service tariffs to achieve 80% and eventually 100% cost recovery levels.&#13;
USAID is providing the government with assistance to meet part of the overall computerization needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
While it is possible for other donors to fill the financing gap, the proposed amount, close to US$3.0&#13;
million, may be significantly large that it cannot be accommodated within existing programs. It may&#13;
not be possible for donors to make funds available within 1996 or early 1997, especially if additional&#13;
approvals are to be sought. The Government has turned to the Bank to fill the gap.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
11.    The proposed Housing and Municipal Services Allowance Computerization Project aims to&#13;
improve the administration of HMSAP by: (a) automating the processing of applications and data in&#13;
the administrative offices; and (b) piloting a system to electronically link the local HMSAP&#13;
administrative offices, regional offices and MSP and monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the&#13;
program. The summary of project objectives and key performance indicators is provided in Schedule&#13;
1.&#13;
System Needs&#13;
12.    The HMSAP administrative offices perform a variety of administrative functions which can&#13;
benefit from automation. The administrative offices receive application forms, verify their&#13;
completeness and accuracy, calculate the amount of allowance (government assistance) granted and&#13;
notify the applicants about the decisions on their applications. Each month, they estimate the total&#13;
value of allowances granted to families within the jurisdiction of their office and allocate this value&#13;
among the Zheks and municipal service enterprises within the area. They maintain records of&#13;
applicants and amounts of allowance granted and prepare monthly reports for the Ministry of Finance&#13;
(value of allowances granted) and the Ministry of Statistics (the number of allowances granted, the&#13;
size of families receiving subsidies and the type of ownership of the home). They recalculate the&#13;
allowances when prices of any municipal services are raised (which happens nearly every month in&#13;
most cities2) and, every six months, recertify participants by verifying updated information. In&#13;
addition, they maintain separate records of families that enrolled in the program with outstanding&#13;
debts for prior month, who are repaying their debts during the six months for which they have been&#13;
granted an allowance.&#13;
13.   It is estimated that one computer is needed for every 40,000 people living in an urban district&#13;
(city rayon), or 25 computers for every one million people in urban areas. A HMSAP administrative&#13;
office in a typical urban district with about 70,000-80,000 people is expected to handle a caseload of&#13;
between 8,000 to 12,000 families. Based on existing levels of activity, this would translate into a&#13;
monthly workload of about 4,000 to 5,000 applications broken down into about 1,000 new applicants,&#13;
about 2,000 families applying for recertification, and about 2,000 families requesting change in&#13;
allowance due to changing economic circumstances. In addition, there is the need to recalculate&#13;
allowances if rents or tariffs are changed, calculate the amounts due to the Zheks and other service&#13;
providers, compute about 250 debt (outstanding payments) repayment schedules and prepare&#13;
monitoring reports. In the future, this could include 50-100 audits of applicant files. Based on those&#13;
pilot offices where computers have been installed, an average operator can process about 100&#13;
applications per day (one every five minutes) or 2,200 a month. Therefore, an administrative office&#13;
in an urban district with 70,000-80,000 people would need two computers and two full time operators&#13;
for those computers.&#13;
2/ The minimum overall rate at which tariffs must be set relative to the costs of production is set by the Cabinet of&#13;
Ministers. Actual tariffs in each locality are set by the regional (oblast) governments. Local utilities, such as&#13;
heating companies and water suppliers, may also request tariff increases to cover the impacts of inflation. The result&#13;
is frequent tariff changes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
14.   Approximately 1,000 computers are estimated to be needed nationwide to complete&#13;
automation of the administration of HMSAP. Local HMSAP offices in the larger urban districts will&#13;
require multiple computers which would be linked together through a local network. Offices in&#13;
smaller cities and towns which require one or two computers will be provided stand alone systems&#13;
with their own printers. It is estimated that about 1,600 computers will be needed to computerize the&#13;
HMSAP. There are approximately 200 computers already in use and another 350 computers are&#13;
being provided by September 1996 through USAID. The project will be providing about 800&#13;
computers or 80% of the estimated needs, taking into consideration the possibility that some local&#13;
governments would purchase some computers on their own. All HMSAP offices will be&#13;
computerized at the completion of the project.&#13;
15.   Software to be used on the computers is already available. USAID consultants have designed&#13;
and developed a micro-based system in Clarion programming and database management language to&#13;
run in a single-user or multi-user platform that calculates and handles allowances and meets most of&#13;
the HMSAP information requirements. The program has been piloted and refined in an operational&#13;
context in several local HMSAP administrative offices and has been transferred to the government.&#13;
Additional refinement need to be made to software from time to time to incorporate changes to the&#13;
HMSAP as mandated by the government and administrative improvements, such as linking the&#13;
HMSAP with the database on pensioners and cost information from the Zheks.&#13;
16.   The regional (oblast) governments are responsible for managing HMSAP in their jurisdiction&#13;
and the local HMSAP administrative offices report to the regional government. However, these&#13;
regional governments lack regular and timely reporting on the program which would allow them to&#13;
identify and address problems as they occur and assess the effectiveness of different local offices.&#13;
The current reporting system, where information, in many cases prepared manually, is transmitted&#13;
first to the Ministry of Statistics and the Ministry of Finance, does not provide government policy&#13;
makers with up to date information on progress on HMSAP. In addition, MSP is interested in&#13;
developing information on regional differences in participation rates, levels of assistance and other&#13;
management information.&#13;
17.   Aware of the need for better management information, MSP is developing management&#13;
information systems with the assistance from USAID. The information needs and software has been&#13;
developed for a pilot national program to link local HMSAP office electronically with MSP through&#13;
the use of modems to provide more up to date and detailed reporting on, among others, the number&#13;
of beneficiaries, their characteristic and provision of allowances. MSP and the Kiev City&#13;
Administration are proposing to create a pilot regional management information system that would&#13;
allow regional HMSAP administrators to obtain accurate and up-to-date information on, among&#13;
others, the housing and municipal service allowance expenditures, staffing levels by office, the levels&#13;
of assistance provided to different Zheks and municipal service providers, appeals of decisions by&#13;
applicants, average time between submission of an application and notification to applicants,&#13;
calculation errors made by office staff, etc. USAID consultants are already developing a network&#13;
connecting local HMSAP offices with the head office for the Kiev City Administration which is&#13;
expected to be completed by September 1996.&#13;

Project Description, Costs and Financing&#13;
18.   The proposed project will be include the installation of hardware and training of staff in&#13;
system operations and will consist of:&#13;
a.   Automation of Data Processing in HMSAP Administrative Offices (US$2.47 million&#13;
equivalent): Installation of around 800 workstations (monitor, computer and key board)&#13;
with Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) units, around 500 printers and diskettes and&#13;
other initial consumables in HMSAP administrative offices nationwide.&#13;
b.   Management Information System (US$158,000 equivalent): Installation of 5&#13;
workstations with UPS, modems with communications software, and initial consumables&#13;
in MSP; installation of 27 workstations with UPS, modems with communications&#13;
software, and initial consumables in regional (oblast) HMSAP offices; and installation of&#13;
80 modems and communication software in selected local HMSAP administrative&#13;
offices.&#13;
c.   Training and Technical Support (US$230,000 equivalent): Provision of 10 workstations&#13;
with UPS, 10 printers and initial consumables for the MSP computer training center;&#13;
classroom and onsite training and follow-up assistance on software use for local&#13;
HMSAP administrative offices; and additional software development.&#13;
d.   Project Administration. Monitoring and Evaluation (US$142,000 equivalent):&#13;
Assistance for overall project administration; a study to evaluate the effectiveness of&#13;
HMSAP, including the impact of automation, and recommendations on additional&#13;
actions required.&#13;
The computers would be powered by Pentium 100 Megahertz microprocessors and contain a&#13;
minimum of 8 MB RAM and 1 GB storage hard drive. Because of the unreliability of the power&#13;
supply, each computer would be backed up with a UPS unit which would allow operators to store all&#13;
data and exit the system in the event of a unexpected power cut.&#13;
19.    Consultant assistance will be needed to oversee project implementation, conduct training,&#13;
provide technical support and carry out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the HMSAP including the&#13;
impact of computerization. Proper training of operators and provision of technical support is essential&#13;
for project sustainability. The training will be carried out in two steps: (a) formal training in the&#13;
MSP's computer training center in Kiev prior to the delivery of the equipment, where key staff from&#13;
the local HMSAP administrative offices will become familiar with the equipment and software to be&#13;
provided through the project; and (b) on the job training where operators in the local offices will be&#13;
trained in the use of the software immediately after installation in their offices. Consultants will also&#13;
provide advisory and technical support to local HMSAP offices. The training and technical support&#13;
plan is provided in Schedule 2. After the computers have been installed, an assessment will be&#13;
carried out of the impact of automation. However, computerization is only the means to facilitate&#13;
HMSAP achieve its program objectives. Therefore, the project evaluation study will include an&#13;
assessment of HMSAP on households and municipal service enterprises. In addition to providing the&#13;
basis for the project operation plan and implementation completion report, this evaluation is critical in&#13;
developing the follow up actions needed to improve targeting of government assistance to the poor&#13;
and strengthen the social safety. During negotiations, the terms of reference of the evaluation were&#13;
discussed and it was agreed that the study will be completed by December 31, 1997.&#13;
20.   The total project cost is estimated to be US$3.0 million equivalent of which US$2.9 million&#13;
equivalent (or 97% of total cost) is estimated to be the foreign exchange requirement. A Bank loan of&#13;
US$2.6 million will finance 100% of the foreign exchange requirements. The Bank loan will finance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
the purchase of equipment for the HMSAP office automation and management information system&#13;
components and consultancies for project implementation. The remaining costs, US$400,000&#13;
equivalent will be provided by: (a) USAID, US$300,000 equivalent, from its ongoing assistance&#13;
program with the MSP for training, technical support and evaluation; and (b) the local government,&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent, for wiring and additional renovations that need to be carried out in the local&#13;
HMSAP offices to accommodate the equipment. The estimated costs and financing plan are&#13;
summarized in Table 1. These estimates do not include the cost of the use of the MSP training&#13;
facility in Kiev for formal training which will be borne by MSP. It was agreed during negotiations&#13;
that the Government will mobilize the necessary funding from alternative sources should USAID not&#13;
be able to finance all the training, technical support and evaluation requirements. This is agreement is&#13;
reflected in the Loan Agreement.&#13;
21.   The loan will be made to the Government of Ukraine at the Bank's standard terms and&#13;
conditions. The equipment will remain the property of the national government and will be rented to&#13;
the local HMSAP administrative office which are under the jurisdiction of the local governments.&#13;
This will ensure consistency with the USAID program and facilitate the administration of the Bank&#13;
loan&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
22.   The benefits are faster processing of allowance applications and faster computation of&#13;
payments to be made at the end of each month to housing maintenance, water and other enterprises.&#13;
Financial benefits are the additional costs that the Government would avoid incurring to met the&#13;
increase in administrative workload following the rapid growth of applications. Without&#13;
computerization, it is estimated that the staff of the local HMSAP administrative offices may need to&#13;
be increased by 2,000 at an estimated cost of Krb 250 billion (about US$1.3 million) per annum.&#13;
23.   Over the longer term, automation of administration and introduction of management&#13;
information systems is critical to the success of HMSAP. The allowance program, in turn, will result&#13;
in overall budgetary savings, reduction in the public sector deficit and targeting of government&#13;
assistance toward the poor and truly needy. In 1994, consumers were estimated to be paying less&#13;
than 5% of housing maintenance and municipal service production costs. The bulk of these costs&#13;
were borne by the government budget; government budgetary assistance for housing and municipal&#13;
service suppliers was estimated to be approximately 4.4% of GDP and 8% of total government&#13;
expenditures. Increase in cost recovery and shift of government assistance from service suppliers to&#13;
needy consumers (i.e. poor households) will result in a reduction in government assistance as those&#13;
who are able to pay are asked bear a larger share of the cost of production compared to the poor who&#13;
cannot afford to pay. In 1995, payments by households are estimated to have increased to around&#13;
36% of housing and municipal service expenditures. As incomes increase, the overall level of&#13;
government assistance for housing and municipal services is projected to decrease.&#13;
Proiect Risks&#13;
24.   HMSAP is a program still in development and further changes are expected. One of the&#13;
issues is the complexity of the administrative process, especially the amount of information that has to&#13;
be collected by applicants and then has to be processed by the local administrative office. MSP is&#13;
reviewing ways to simplify the application process which would lead to changes in the way&#13;
information is processed; e.g. linking the HMSAP and pension databases so that pensioners need not&#13;
obtain separate documentation on their eligibility or pension amounts. The developers of the software&#13;
were aware of the potential changes and the software is designed to be flexible and accommodate&#13;
modifications to the information requirements and administrative procedures. Therefore, anticipated&#13;
changes in the application process would not result in the system being made obsolete.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
25.   The installation of the equipment wtil be a logistical challenge. When combined with the&#13;
USAID program, there will be close to 700 computers being installed in several hundred local&#13;
HMSAP administrative offices nationwide. Office space will have to be provided, provision made&#13;
that power supply and access to telephone lines (for faxes and modem) is adequate, delivery and&#13;
installation scheduled, software loaded on to the computers and training provided. The phasing of&#13;
installation, delivery and training were reviewed in detail during appraisal and contracting&#13;
arrangements were structured accordingly. A detailed implementation plan will be developed to&#13;
assure proper coordination (para. 29).&#13;
26.   While both the Bank and government are interested in proceeding very quickly with the&#13;
purchase of equipment given the anticipated increase in applications for HMSAP allowances, the&#13;
formal government approval process for foreign borrowings has lead to delays in past loans.&#13;
Although the loan amount is small, the legislature (the Supreme Rada) would most likely be required&#13;
to approve this loan before it can be declared effective. The government has been quick in processing&#13;
the original request for Bank assistance. Ways to minimize the start up time were discussed with the&#13;
Government during appraisal and negotiations are part of the overall implementation schedule and&#13;
clear benchmarks established and agreed to monitor progress (Schedule 3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
B. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND JIMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Organization and Management&#13;
27.   MSP will be responsible for project implementation. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU),&#13;
consisting of three persons (a project manager, information technology specialist, secretary), will be&#13;
established within MSP. The PIU will be responsible for: (a) phasing and coordination of purchase&#13;
and installation of equipment and organization of training and follow up assistance; (b) purchase of&#13;
computers, printers and other equipment; (c) maintaining project accounts and monitoring overall&#13;
project implementation; (d) overseeing preparation of the evaluation report; and (e) coordination with&#13;
the Bank. The training and technical support consultants will provide assistance with software&#13;
installation, operator training and software trouble shooting and support. A procurement consultant&#13;
will assist MSP conduct the tendering of the equipment contracts and oversee delivery of equipment.&#13;
28.   Under the overall coordination of the PIU, implementation will be carried out as follows:&#13;
a.   Site Preparation: Local governments will be responsible for providing: adequate space&#13;
with security and ventilation (temperature control); desks and other office furniture; and&#13;
access to electricity and telephone line where modems are to be installed.&#13;
b.   Delivery of Equipment: The contractor (selected through competitive bid) will be&#13;
responsible for delivery of equipment to Kiev (for testing and installation of application&#13;
software) and subsequently to the local HMSAP offices. In case of network systems,&#13;
the contractor will be responsible for hook-up.&#13;
c.  Installation of Application Software and Set-up of Network Systems: The technical&#13;
support consultants will be responsible for installation of software and site testing of&#13;
network systems.&#13;
d.   Training: (i) General Training: MSP (with assistance from the technical support&#13;
consultants) will be responsible for carrying out training on HMSAP and initial&#13;
orientation of the application software; (ii) the technical support consultants will be&#13;
responsible for on-site training for local HMSAP staff.&#13;
e.   Follow-Up Support: The technical support consultants will be responsible for resolving&#13;
applications software problems and carrying out additional enhancements to the&#13;
application software.&#13;
The implementation plan and key benchmarks for monitoring implementation progress are presented&#13;
in Schedule 3.&#13;
29.   Proper coordination of training and technical support with the delivery of the equipment is&#13;
essential for the success of the project. It was agreed during negotiations that MSP will prepare a&#13;
detailed plan for scheduling training, technical support and equipment delivery by November 1, 1996.&#13;
This understanding is reflected in the Loan Agreement.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
30.   The procurement of goods under Bank financed components would be procured in accordance&#13;
with the Bank/IDA procurement guidelines. The project components not financed by the Bank would&#13;
be procured in accordance with the national regulations or the cofinancing institutions procurement&#13;
regulations. The project elements, their estimated cost and procurement methods are sunmuarized in&#13;
Table 1 of Schedule 4. A procurement plan detailing packaging and estimated schedules of the major&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
procurement actions is presented in Table 2 of Schedule 4. All other procurement information,&#13;
including capability of the implementing agency, estimated dates for publication of the General&#13;
Procurement Notice and the Bank's review process is presented in Table 3 of Schedule 4.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
31.    The Bank loan will finance: (a) 100% of foreign and local ex-factory expenditures and 75%&#13;
of local expenditures for items procured locally; and (b) 100% of consultant services. Direct&#13;
payments would be made to suppliers of equipment based on the contract. All equipment delivery,&#13;
consultant contracts and disbursement are expected to be completed by December 31, 1997. June 30,&#13;
1998 is proposed for loan closing.&#13;
Accounts, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
32.    Since the project will consist of a limited number of contracts3, the monitoring and&#13;
supervision requirements will be minimal. MSP through the PIU will maintain project accounts and&#13;
arrange for project audits. No mid-term evaluation is planned. An evaluation will be carried out of&#13;
the HMSAP program, including the impact of automation at the conclusion of the project.&#13;
3/ The project is expected to consist of four contracts: one goods contracts for the purchase of computers and&#13;
related equipment and three consultant contracts (training and technical support, project implementation and&#13;
evaluation study).&#13;

SCHEDULE 2&#13;
UKRAINE&#13;
SOCIAL PROTECTION SUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
Training and Technical Support Plan&#13;
Background&#13;
1.     A training program has already been developed based on the pilot Housing and Municipal&#13;
Service Allowance Program (HMSAP) office automation carried out by the USAID consultants&#13;
(Padco). The existing training program is targeted for training the trainers from local staff of the&#13;
local administrative offices who would be responsible for supervising and/or operating the equipment&#13;
and software in their respective offices.&#13;
2.      The pilot program has shown that there is an adequate supply of personnel in most urban&#13;
HMSAP administrative offices who have some knowledge of computers and can be readily trained in&#13;
the use of equipment and software to be provided through the project.&#13;
3.     The existing training has been designed to consist of two stages. First, key personnel from&#13;
regional offices and local administrative offices are provided with a basic training in the use of&#13;
computers and the software in Kiev prior to installation of equipment and software in their respective&#13;
offices. The training session takes one week (five working days) and involves about 25 trainees (to&#13;
be trainers)4. The Ministry of Social Protection (MSP) has a training facility in Kiev that includes&#13;
adequate space for the temporary installation of 6 computers as well as dormitories and dining&#13;
facilities for low cost accommodation of trainees. A manual for users of the subsidy software&#13;
program has also been developed and is being used as the basis for training. Participants receive&#13;
sufficient copies of the manual to supply all computer staff in their offices and they are provided with&#13;
additional materials that explain the basics of using the computer systems.&#13;
4.      This formal training session is followed by on-site training at the local office as needed. On-&#13;
site training sessions are provided by the computer system technicians of the Padco's Technical&#13;
Support Office5. These technicians are familiar with the use of computer systems (operating software,&#13;
HMSAP and MIS application software, and other office technology equipment). Each Padco&#13;
technician can provide the overall technical support by telephone/fax and/or site visits of 20 to 30&#13;
local subsidy administrative offices. Specifically, these technicians are responsible for:&#13;
a.    On-site training of local staff in the use of computer systems, as requested by the local&#13;
offices;&#13;
4/ The one week course includes training in the use of the computers and the HMSAP administration software.&#13;
MSP also offers a two week course that includes one week training on the legal basis for and administrative aspects&#13;
of HMSAP and one week on the computers.&#13;
51-l Technical Support Office is currently being managed by Padco. At present, it consists of 18 computer system&#13;
technicians, 6 of them are located in Kiev and the other 12 technicians are assigned in 6 regions (Oblasts) where the&#13;
pilot HMSAP automation is being carried out.. It is anticipated that 14 additional computer system technicians would&#13;
be required to support the upcoming nationwide system of HMSAP. In addition to the Technical Support Office,&#13;
Padco also has an Application Software Development Office in Kiev, consisting of 6 systems analysts and&#13;
programmers who are responsible for the development and maintenance of application software for HMSAP and MIS&#13;
systems. In order to provide adequate services in the ongoing new application software development and&#13;
maintenance of the existing application software in use, it is anticipated that 5 additional systems analysts and&#13;
programmers would be required during the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
b.   Customizing software to meet the specific requirements of local offices, where&#13;
applicable;&#13;
c.   Provision of technical guidance associated with overall computer system administration&#13;
functions, particularly in the areas of computer system security and routine data back-up&#13;
and recovery; and&#13;
d.   Identification of administrative and/or technical problems and preparation of feedback&#13;
on additional training requirements and application software system enhancements that&#13;
may be incorporated into future training program and the new release of application&#13;
software.&#13;
In addition, these technicians also assist the local offices in dealing with the work tasks associated&#13;
with the computer systems installation (e.g., cabling and connection of computer network systems,&#13;
installation of the required operating and application software products) and developing long term&#13;
contracts for computer assistance. While the equipment vendors are expected to provide warranties&#13;
for equipment they have supplied, the local offices may also need help with various technical&#13;
problems related to the use of software and equipment. In most urban areas, there are private&#13;
enterprises that provide technical computer support. The process of installing equipment and training&#13;
staff is designed to ensure that, when the technical specialist leaves, local office staff will be able not&#13;
only to operate the equipment and use the software, but will also know how to ensure the continued&#13;
effective use of the equipment.&#13;
5.    USAID consultants (Padco) presently provide telephone/fax consultation to local HMSAP&#13;
administrative offices on computer hardware and software issues. During the project, the MSP is&#13;
expected to establish "a technical advisory hotline" initially in Kiev to provide advise, as needed, to&#13;
the local administrative offices.&#13;
Equipment to be Provided under the Bank Project&#13;
6.    The Social Protection Support Project will provide additional equipment to the MSP and the&#13;
regional (oblast) and local HMSAP administrative offices to complete the automation of program&#13;
administration and introduce a management information system. The project will include the&#13;
following equipment:&#13;
a.   Automation of Data Processing in HMSAP Administrative Offices. Installation of about&#13;
800 workstations (PCs stand-alone and peer-to-peer networks) with Uninterrupted Power&#13;
Supply (UPS) units, and about 500 printers in HMSAP administrative offices&#13;
nationwide;&#13;
b.   Management Information System (MIS). Installation of 5 workstations with UPS,&#13;
printers, modems and communications software MSP; installation of 27 workstations&#13;
with UPS units, modems and communications software, and printers in 27 oblast&#13;
administrative offices; and installation of about 80 modems with communications&#13;
software in around 80 selected local HMSAP administrative offices;&#13;
c.   Training. Provision of 10 workstations with UPS units and printers for the MSP&#13;
computer training center.&#13;
The equipment will complement and be compatable to the equipment provided through the USAID&#13;
pilot program and will utilize the same software. The equipment is expected to be delivered during&#13;
the first half of 1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
Training and Technical Support Under the Project&#13;
7.     Provision of training and technical support will be critical to the successful implementation of&#13;
the nationwide automation program. USAID will expand its technical support and training to include&#13;
computers and equipment being financed through the Bank loan. This assistance would be a&#13;
continuation of the support currently being provided by USAID and is expected to include:&#13;
a.   Assistance in the preparation of designated offices to ensure the readiness and suitability&#13;
of facilities for the installation of computer systems and other office technology&#13;
equipment;&#13;
b.   Acceptance testings for all computer systems and office technology equipment that are&#13;
delivered by the selected supplier;&#13;
c.   Installation and testing of HMSAP and MIS application software systems for all&#13;
designated local, regional, and headquarters offices;&#13;
d.   Formal and on-site training sessions for computer operators and end users as established&#13;
in the MSP training program;&#13;
e.   Additional system development and up-dating of documentation (technical system&#13;
design, user's manual, installation manual, and training documents);&#13;
f.   Assistance to MSP in the establishment of and staffing for "a technical advisory hotline"&#13;
to provide the day-to-day operational guidance to the user community;&#13;
g.   On-the-job training in all aspects of computing to all designated MSP computer system&#13;
technicians so that they will be able to take over the operational support of the&#13;
automated systems at the end of this contract.&#13;
This will be an expansion of the existing support under the USAID pilot project to all remaining local&#13;
HMSAP administrative offices.&#13;
8.     The existing training program has proven to be cost effective and successful and would be&#13;
used to train staff from the HMSAP offices supported by the Bank project. MSP with the assistance&#13;
of USAID consultants would continue to organize and finance the training of trainers in Kiev of about&#13;
300 additional staff in local offices from all 24 Oblasts throughout the country. Upon completion of&#13;
the formal training sessions, these trainees, supported by the field computer system technicians&#13;
designated to their respective regions will become the trainers in formal and on-site training sessions&#13;
for the remaining staff in their own local offices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
9.    To complete the required training program for HMSAP and MIS in a timely manner, the&#13;
MSP would need to organize and carry out six additional formal training sessions in the Kiev training&#13;
facilities according to the following tentative schedules:&#13;
Session #           No. of Trainees      Start Date    End Date&#13;
(25 per class)&#13;
1                   50                    1/13/97             1/17/97&#13;
2                   50                    1/27/97             1/31/97&#13;
3                   50                   2/10/97             2/14/97&#13;
4                   50                    2/24/97             2/28/97&#13;
5                   50                    3/10/97             3/14/97&#13;
6                   50                    3/24/97             3/28/97&#13;
It should be noted that the delivery and installation of the computer systems, under the project&#13;
financing, in the designated local offices are anticipated to occur from about March 3 to June 16,&#13;
1997. Therefore, on-site training sessions, if required, would need to be established for each local&#13;
office in accordance with the anticipated completion date of computer system installation and&#13;
acceptance testings.&#13;
10.   MSP would take over the training and technical support functions once the USAID assistance&#13;
is completed. Transfer of expertise and knowledge from the USAID consultants to MSP will be an&#13;
important part of the training and technical assistance plan. MSP is expected to designate about 20&#13;
computer system technicians to work with and be trained by the USAID consultants during the&#13;
project.&#13;
11.   A detailed plan would be prepared to assure proper coordination of the delivery of equipment,&#13;
formal and on-the-job training and technical support by November 1, 1996 or when the tender&#13;
documents and delivery schedule of the equipment have been prepared.&#13;
