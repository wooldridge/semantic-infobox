INTERNATIONAL ADJUSTMENT IN THE 1980s&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report 1981&#13;
This paper is addressed to the adjustment problems facing the&#13;
world economy in the next decade, with particular reference to the situation&#13;
and prospects of the non-oil developing countries (NDCs). The NDCs grew&#13;
faster than the industrial countries (ICs) during the 1950s and 1960s in&#13;
aggregate GNP, though not in GNP per head. More strikingly, the NDCs&#13;
maintained their growth rates in the 1970s (albeit at the cost of higher&#13;
inflation), whereas the performance of the ICs deteriorated markedly on all&#13;
fronts. In the ICs, growth rates of GNP declined by more than a third,&#13;
unemployment nearly doubled, and inflation more than trebled.&#13;
Over the next five years, the crucial determinant of NDC growth will&#13;
be IC growth. If the ICs stagnate, it will be difficult to avoid a slowing&#13;
down of NDC growth. But the harshness of this effect can be mitigated by&#13;
active steps to promote recycling of funds through international public&#13;
institutions. In a deflationary atmosphere, the imperfections of the capital&#13;
market would be exacerbated, and left to itself the market is likely to perform&#13;
below tolerable levels of efficiency.&#13;

I. The International Conjuncture&#13;
This paper is addressed to the adjustment problems facing the&#13;
world economy in the next decade, with particular reference to the situation&#13;
and prospects of the non-oil developing countries (NDCs). The NDCs grew&#13;
faster than the industrial countries (ICs) during the 1950s and 1960s in&#13;
aggregate GNP, though not in GNP per head. More strikingly, the NDCs&#13;
maintained their growth rates in the 1970s (albeit at the cost of higher&#13;
inflation), whereas the performance of the ICs deteriorated markedly on all&#13;
fronts. In the ICs, growth rates of GNP declined by more than a third,&#13;
unemployment nearly doubled, and inflation more than trebled.&#13;
The price of crude oil has played a spectacular part in recent&#13;
economic developments: it quadrupled in 1973, doubled in 1979/80, and much of&#13;
the analysis of this paper will be concerned with the problems of adjustment&#13;
to this recent increase. It is important to bear in mind, however, that the&#13;
oil price increase was far from being the only or even the most important&#13;
factor underlying the mediocre performance of the ICs in the 1970s. First,&#13;
there was a fall in the rate of growth of maximum or potential output in the&#13;
ICs, only a small part of which can be explained by the rise in the real cost&#13;
of energy. There were a variety of other contributory factors such as the&#13;
deceleration in the rate of technological progress in the United States&#13;
combined with "technological catching-up" by Europe and Japan, the exhaustion&#13;
of economies from sectoral reallocation of labor, the increased emphasis on&#13;
conservation and extramarket aspects of welfare, and, more controversial, the&#13;
distortions caused by floating rates and increased protectionism. Second, the&#13;
oil price increase cannot explain the prolonged nature of the stagflation that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
ensued. Inflation had of course been accelerating prior to 1973, largely&#13;
owing to irresponsible monetary policies in the ICs, particularly in the&#13;
United States, and IC governments had already begun to respond with restrictive&#13;
policies. The oil price increase simultaneously reduced demand, increased&#13;
costs, and created foreign deficits; IC.governments concentrated on the last&#13;
two effects and responded with further doses of deflation. The effectiveness&#13;
of this response was, however, blunted by the "structural" worsening of the&#13;
inflation/unemployment tradeoff caused by fundamental factors affecting labor&#13;
markets, such as increased participation rates, increased unemployment&#13;
Insurance, increased trade union power, and real wage resistance, the last&#13;
two factors being partly a reflection of sharper disagreement about the just&#13;
distribution of the national product. There are some who would also attribute&#13;
part of the blame for the worsening tradeoff to the collapse of the Bretton&#13;
Woods system and the advent of floating rates. Third, it is also clear that&#13;
the severity of the recession in the mid-1970s cannot be explained by&#13;
'tsupply side" factors alone. It seems clear, in retrospect, that deflationary&#13;
policies overshot the mark since they were pursued in an uncoordinated manner,&#13;
even by countries in strong balance-of-payments positions, with little regard&#13;
to the fact that other countries were pursuing simultaneous deflation.&#13;
In contrast to the ICs, the NDCs, with the exception of some low-&#13;
income African countries, performed remarkably well during the 1970s. It is&#13;
of course true that, although the international environment was hostile to&#13;
them in many respects, it was reasonably benign as far as capital flows were&#13;
concerned. Both concessional and commercial flows of capital to the NDCs&#13;
expanded rapidly. The criticism that growth was maintained by excessive&#13;
borrowing is, in general, unfounded if the evolution of debt/GNP and debt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
service/exports ratios are anything to go by. 1/ Data collected 'by the&#13;
World Bank show only a modest increase in the ratio of "public and publicly-&#13;
guaranteed long-term external debt" to exports of goods and services for all&#13;
NDCs, from 70 percent in 1973 to 78.5 percent in 1979. The analogous debt/GDP&#13;
ratio rose from 13 percent in 1973 to 18 percent in 1979. The ratio of debt&#13;
service payments to exports of goods and services rose from 9 percent in 1973&#13;
to 13 percent in 1979. Historically, these ratios do not look at all alarming.&#13;
Sir Arthur Lewis quotes a figure of 2.25 percent for the ratio of total debt&#13;
to exports for the low-debt capital-importing countries (China, Japan, India)&#13;
in 1913, 4.8 for Australia, 5.2 for Latin America, and 8.6 for Canada.&#13;
(Lewis's figures are not directly comparable since they include private debt&#13;
in the numerator and exclude exports of services in the denominator; neverthe-&#13;
less, the orders of magnitude suffice to make the point.) Again, Lewis cites&#13;
a figure of 60 percent for the debt service/exports ratio for Argentina in&#13;
1890. This is not to deny that particular countries (e.g., Brazil, Mexico)&#13;
face debt problems (though even in their case, it is only the debt service/&#13;
exports ratio that looks high by historical standards, not the debt/exports&#13;
ratio), and that the capital market may take a less sanguine view about these&#13;
ratios than economic historians. (The reasons and remedies for this&#13;
phenomenon are discussed later in the paper.)&#13;
The NDCs' economic performance is significant because it puts&#13;
to rest the notion that they suffer from a general lack of "absorptive&#13;
capacity." There is a presumption in economic theory based on the principle&#13;
1/   For drawing my attention to the historical facts, I am indebted to&#13;
J. Williamson, The Why and How of Funding LDC Debt, 1980 (Mimeo).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

of diminishing returns that capital should flow from capital-rich to capital-&#13;
poor countries, a presumption which is sometimes attacked on the ground that&#13;
"differences in production functions" reverse the implied direction of varia-&#13;
tion in the rate of return to capital. The experience of the 1970s, on&#13;
balance, suggests that this is a non-problem and that "lack of absorptive&#13;
capacity" is in fact more likely to afflict the ICs than the NDCs. The&#13;
general "world efficiency" argument in favor of increased capital flows from&#13;
the ICs and the capital-surplus oil-exporting countries (OECs), whose surpluses&#13;
are quite evidently far in excess of their investment possibilities, to those&#13;
NDCs which already possess adequate stocks of social overhead capital and&#13;
skilled labor is, therefore, reinforced. It must be admitted, however,&#13;
that economic growth in some (though by no means all) low-income NDCs requires&#13;
substantial investment in infrastructure and social overhead capital, which&#13;
cannot plausibly be undertaken on the basis of inflows of commercial capital&#13;
since the return on such investment cannot, by its nature, be fully appro-&#13;
priated by investors. Capital flows to these countries must inevitably find&#13;
their justification--to some extent, and for the moment--in international&#13;
altruism.&#13;
The long-run desirability of increased capital flows toward the&#13;
NDCs does not, of course, diminish the need for adjustment by all countries,&#13;
including the NDCs, to the recent oil price increase, and it is to this&#13;
question that we now turn.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

II   Analysis of the Impact of the Oil Price Increase&#13;
The purpose of this section is to analyze the implications of the&#13;
oil price increase. For simplicity, the world is divided into three groupings:&#13;
members of the capital-surplus oil-exporting countries (OECs), industrial&#13;
countries (ICs) and non-oil developing countries (NDCs). 1/ To start, we&#13;
assume perfectly functioning markets; we then introduce various distortions,&#13;
in each case examining the likely impact on the NDCs.&#13;
World Economy without Distortions&#13;
Suppose all markets in all countries work perfectly or are made to&#13;
work perfectly by national governments. Assume, further, that national&#13;
economic policies are perfectly coordinated to achieve world efficiency&#13;
(subject, of course, to the constraint imposed by the oil price increase).&#13;
The primary implication of a permanent and effective increase in the price of&#13;
oil is then seen transparently to be (a) a reduction in world real income, and&#13;
(b) a redistribution of world income toward the OECs. The reduction in world&#13;
income is the result of users of oil and oil-substitutes having to pay prices&#13;
which are higher than the marginal cost of oil production. (Of course, the&#13;
high price of oil imposed by OECs may be "efficient" in the sense that it&#13;
correctly reflects the future scarcity of energy which is systematically&#13;
underestimated by the market. If that is so, there cannot be said to be a&#13;
loss of world income.) More important, there is a redistribution of world&#13;
income toward the OEC. This redistribution is, however, compatible with many&#13;
different time-patterns of real expenditure changes in OEC and non-OEC;&#13;
these different desired time-patterns are brought into consistency through&#13;
current account surpluses in OECs and the counterpart current account deficits&#13;
1/   Thus, the capital-deficit oil-exporting developing countries are&#13;
excluded from the analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
in non-OECs. At one extreme, we could have zero current account balance with&#13;
OECs taking their real income increase, as and when it occurs, in the form of&#13;
increased consumption and domestic investment, and non-OECs, as a whole1 taking&#13;
a corresponding immediate cut in real expenditure and standard of living. At&#13;
the other extreme, OECs may not increase their consumption or domestic invest-&#13;
ment at all, in which case the entire real income increase of the OECs would&#13;
accrue as (future) returns to increased holdings of non-OEC financial assets.&#13;
The actual outcome is obviously likely to be between the extremes. The OECs&#13;
would wish to take their real income increase partly in increased current&#13;
consumption, partly in increased current domestic investment, and partly in&#13;
foreign lending, the latter two being ways of increasing future or "permanent"&#13;
consumption above its previous trend, as contrasted with squandering the real&#13;
income increase entirely in an immediate consumption splurge. Indeed, since&#13;
the "high earners" among the OECs also happen to be the "low absorbers," OECs&#13;
can be expected to be biased in favor of substantial foreign lending, though&#13;
it must be remembered here that they do have the further option of leaving oil&#13;
in the ground. This gives the non-OEC world the opportunity to avoid taking&#13;
its real income loss entirely as reduced current consumption or domestic&#13;
investment; it can borrow from the OECs to sustain one or the other, or both&#13;
to some degree, depending on its preference between present and future consump-&#13;
tion on the one hand, and the rate of return which can be earned on domestic&#13;
investment on the other. Why can domestic investment on the basis of borrow-&#13;
ing from OECs make sense even in this world of perfect markets where one can&#13;
expect that all profitable investments would have already been carried out?&#13;
The answer is, of course, that the redistribution of world income toward OECs&#13;
leads to an increase in the world propensity to save, which brings down the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
world rate of interest. This will make extra investment in non-OECs profit-&#13;
able; there is, in any case, a prima facie case for investment in oil-&#13;
substitutes. (Note here that if we depart from our assumptions and suppose&#13;
that there is a backlog of unexploited investment opportunities with high&#13;
rates of return in the non-QEC world, the "burden of adjustment" on non-OECs&#13;
is considerably lightened since more can prudently be borrowed from OECs. We&#13;
return to this point later.)&#13;
What are the implications of this model for the distribution of the&#13;
burden of adjustment within the non-OEC world? At the macroeconomic level,&#13;
each country can enjoy full utilization of resources. The present worth of&#13;
the cut in real expenditure that each country has to bear depends on the case&#13;
with which it can do without imported oil. The less flexible it is in this&#13;
respect, and in the ability to reallocate resources and compete on world&#13;
markets generally, the greater the sacrifice of real expenditure it has to&#13;
make, now or in the future, to adjust its balance of payments on current&#13;
account. The feasible time-pattern of the real expenditure cut depends on the&#13;
ease with which it can attract capital flows from OECs, directly or though the&#13;
intermediation of the capital market, which may.itself be related to the&#13;
flexibility mentioned above. To the extent that the economy cannot attract&#13;
capital flows, it has to suffer its real expenditure cut now, rather than&#13;
later, before production or consumption elasticities have had time to operate.&#13;
These considerations suggest the following implications for the&#13;
NDCs, even under the assumptions of perfect markets and perfect coordination&#13;
of national policies.&#13;
*   There is no presumption that the NDCs will, in general, be less&#13;
flexible than the ICs, or that they will, in general, be starved of capital&#13;
inflows. Nevertheless, there is a sense in which even a real expenditure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
cut spread uniformly across all countries bears unfairly on the NDCs since&#13;
they have much lower per capita incomes than the ICs. This is, of course, a&#13;
moral point, unrelated to the maximization of world efficiency.&#13;
*         Even on the strong assumptions of this model, there is a presumption&#13;
that a sub-set of NDCs would suffer a disproportionately heavy immediate cut&#13;
in real expenditure; namely, the NDCs with fundamentally weak economies,&#13;
highly immobile resources, low levels of technology and infrastructure,&#13;
undiversified productive structures, and low elasticities of demand for&#13;
exports and imports (e.g., the low-income NDCs in Africa?). Such economies&#13;
are at a double disadvantage in that they are inflexible and cannot attract&#13;
commercial capital. The inflexibility requires the real expenditure cut to be&#13;
large; the inability to attract capital requires it to be immediate. In&#13;
such economies, international altruism has, of course, a particularly important&#13;
part to play.&#13;
The above analysis highlights the basic implications of the oil&#13;
price increase on very favorable assumptions. We now proceed to relax these&#13;
assumptions.&#13;
Immobile Factors, Inflexible Prices, and Real Income Resistance&#13;
We were considering above a world of smooth adjustment. Adjustment&#13;
may not be smooth because of price rigidities and inflexibility in the economic&#13;
structure. As seen above, the response to the oil price rise in each country&#13;
requires some current account adjustment, the timing and extent of the adjust-&#13;
ment being dependent on the magnitude and timing of capital flows. The&#13;
current account adjustment requires both microeconomic and macroeconomic&#13;
changes. At the microeconomic level, there have to be switches in production&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
toward oil and its substitutes, in techniques of production away from oil-&#13;
intensive methods, and in consumption away from oil and its complements.&#13;
These adjustments require changes in relative prices; in general, a resource&#13;
shift towards capital-intensive energy production is likely to involve a&#13;
reduction in the real wage. At the macroeconomic level, the maintenance of&#13;
internal balance combined with current account adjustment involves a shift of&#13;
resources out of producing nontraded goods into traded goods, and a shift of&#13;
consumption in the opposite direction combined with the appropriate demand-&#13;
management policy. In general, these changes require either a reduction of&#13;
money incomes and of prices of nontraded goods relative to prices of traded&#13;
goods or an increase in the prices of traded goods relative to money incomes&#13;
and prices of nontraded goods. The former is commonly agreed to be impossible&#13;
in the real world: an effort to adjust in that way is liable to lead to a&#13;
multiplier reduction in output, employment, and real expenditure. The&#13;
standard prescription for current account adjustment, therefore, is currency&#13;
depreciation coupled with demand management.&#13;
The impact effect of currency depreciation is favorable in that&#13;
it raises the prices of traded goods relative to other prices, but the&#13;
effectiveness of the depreciation depends upon whether the relative price&#13;
change can be made to stick over the fairly long period of time required to&#13;
make the current account respond. Two major changes are involved: (a) on the&#13;
reasonable assumption that nontraded goods are labor intensive compared to&#13;
traded goods, the real wage has to fall if the composition of output is to&#13;
shift towards traded goods; and (b) since the real expenditure reduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
cannot be avoided, it has to be borne by somebody, and, unless real profit&#13;
margins can be squeezed, the cut has to fall on the real incomes of workers.&#13;
If these changes in real prices and/or real incomes are resisted, depreciation&#13;
cannot work. Such resistance can, in fact, lead to inflation as the natural&#13;
result of the economy's attempt to impose the real expenditure cut on one or&#13;
another group. Prolonged real income resistance leads to an inflationary&#13;
spiral which governments may then have to break by severe deflationary policies.&#13;
Currency depreciation, therefore, is by no means a panacea. In practice,&#13;
current account adjustment may often involve reductions in output and, hence,&#13;
reductions in real expenditure greater than would be necessary if output could&#13;
be kept constant.&#13;
The following comments are in order on the application of this&#13;
discussion to the ICs and the NDCs.&#13;
*         Current account adjustment to the oil price rise requires various&#13;
changes in relative prices. To put these changes into effect may require&#13;
government action (or inaction). For example, the rise in the price of oil&#13;
must be allowed to pass through to the prices of oil-related products.&#13;
Governments can prevent this happening by changes in tax policy with regard to&#13;
these products. To take another example, the government could undo some of&#13;
the effects of a depreciation-induced increase in the relative price of traded&#13;
to nontraded goods by increasing effective subsidies to maintaining the size&#13;
of central and local government administration.&#13;
*    The macroeconomic and microeconomic changes involve, in general, a&#13;
reduction in the real wage and in real factor incomes. This reduction&#13;

can be prevented by powerful trade unions and by oligopolistic industries.&#13;
The problem is likely to be more serious in open economies in which the ratio&#13;
of traded goods to GNP is high and, therefore, the effect of exchange depre-&#13;
ciation on the cost of living is highly visible.&#13;
*         Moderate flexibility of real prices is necessary for resource&#13;
allocation, but it may not be sufficient unless supplies and demands respond&#13;
adequately. Obviously, the role of the government is crucial in creating an&#13;
economic climate in which such responses can occur.&#13;
Real income resistance could obviously hamper adjustment in any&#13;
economy, but it would appear to be particularly related to rigidities in the&#13;
labor market which are characteristic of some of the ICs. In most (though not&#13;
all) NDCs, trade unions are not powerful enough to secure full and immediate&#13;
compensation for exchange rate changes. In the NDCs, adjustment is more&#13;
likely to be obstructed by inflexibilities in the economic structure, sometimes&#13;
created by government policy. For example, a policy of industrialization&#13;
behind high protective barriers--particularly if protection is in the form of&#13;
quantitative controls--can create an economic structure which is rather&#13;
insensitive to exchange rate changes because many goods which are tradeable in&#13;
effect become nontraded. Of course, the NDCs differ considerably in their&#13;
degree of insulation from world market forces. Inflexibilities in economic&#13;
structure are not necessarily related to government policy. We have already&#13;
referred to the special case of some low-income NDCs where the inflexibility&#13;
is of a more fundamental nature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Apart from the low-income NDCs, however, there is no particular&#13;
reason to believe that the adjustment problems of NDCs are more serious than&#13;
those of the ICs as a result of internal inflexibilities. The main reason for&#13;
the greater harshness of adjustment in the NDCs are twofold. (a) As argued&#13;
above, the ICs tend, even when exchange rate changes are possible, to adjust&#13;
by deflationary policies. This adds considerably to the difficulty of&#13;
adjusting to the oil price increase. The greater economic weight of the ICs&#13;
in the world economy means that their policies affect the NDCs far more than&#13;
the latter affect the former. (b) More immediate current account adjustment&#13;
is forced on to the NDCs compared to the ICs because the latter are more easily&#13;
able to attract capital inflows. This is partly because of the imperfect&#13;
nature of the world capital market. It is to these two issues that we now turn.&#13;
Inappropriate National Macroeconomic Policies&#13;
International equilibrium requires that OECs' desired current&#13;
account surplus should equal non-OECs' desired current account deficit.     If&#13;
the two are incompatible, then the equilibration may be achieved by a decline&#13;
in world income and growth. Incompatibility could arise in the following way.&#13;
Assume a given non-OEC growth rate. Assume that this implies, given the&#13;
development plans of the OECs, a current account surplus of specified magnitude&#13;
for the OECs. Now the given non-OEC growth rate could be distributed between ICs&#13;
ICs and NDCs in many different ways, implying also different distributions of&#13;
current account deficits. Whether the assumed non-OEC growth rate can be&#13;
realized clearly depends on (a) whether the distribution of growth rates and&#13;
current account deficits between ICs and NDCs is regarded as satisfactory&#13;
by the countries concerned; and (b) whether the capital market efficiently&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
provides the financing required to cover these deficits. (Note that the&#13;
assumption that the OEC surplus is fixed independently of the distribution of&#13;
growth rates within the OECs is too simple. But relaxing it does not affect&#13;
the main point.)&#13;
Suppose that the ICs (or some of the principal ICs) wish to have&#13;
smaller current account deficits than they find themselves with and therefore&#13;
pursue deflationary policies. Maintenance of the assumed non-OEC growth rate&#13;
requires that the NDCs grow faster and run bigger deficits. If the NDCs are&#13;
not willing to do this or if the capital market will not allow them to do&#13;
this, they too are forced into deflationary policies which then react back on&#13;
to the ICs. The outcome of the process is a decline in non-OEC growth. In&#13;
principle, a perfectly functioning capital market could be of considerable&#13;
help in preventing this outcome through the mechanism of interest rate changes.&#13;
But the capital market may not function perfectly, and even if prices in the&#13;
capital market are flexible, the mechanisms may not work with sufficient speed&#13;
to prevent aggregate income changes. There is, therefore, some danger that if&#13;
the ICs deflate in order to reduce current account deficits, the deficits will&#13;
be "passed on" to the NDCs, which would be forced to deflate in turn, if the&#13;
capital market regards increased NDC deficits as unsustainable.&#13;
In the above argument, we concentrated on the failure to achieve&#13;
a given non-OEC growth. The argument can be extended to attempts to change&#13;
total non-OEC growth, with either (a) constant shares of ICs and NDCs in&#13;
overall growth, or (b) changes in these shares. In both these cases changes&#13;
in the OEC surplus cannot be assumed away, but the essentials of the argument&#13;
remain the same. For example, an increase in total non-OEC growth would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
require an increase in the OECs' current account surplus and in non-OECs'&#13;
current account deficit. This may not be realized if the surplus cannot be&#13;
efficiently recycled or if the OECs and non-OECs are not content with the&#13;
changes. Turning to case (b), consider the possibility of increasing NDC&#13;
growth, keeping IC growth constant. This would require an increased NDC&#13;
deficit vis-a-vis the OECs which has to be financed by the increased OEC sur-&#13;
plus. But it also implies an increase in NDC current deficit with ICs and&#13;
therefore a reduction in the overall current deficit of the ICs. If the ICs&#13;
are not willing to see output rise or to transfer a larger part of current&#13;
output to the NDCs, as would be implied by the increased NDC deficit with ICs,&#13;
then the IC exchange rates would appreciate, NDC terms of trade would worsen,&#13;
and NDCs would not succeed in raising their growth rate.&#13;
Imperfections of the World Capital Market&#13;
Perhaps the most important reason why the oil price increase is&#13;
actually or potentially very damaging to the economic prospects of the NDCs&#13;
(and more damaging than it is to the ICs) is the imperfection of the world&#13;
capital market. Of course, there is no denying the fact that during the 1970s&#13;
the capital market did perform with remarkable flexibility, much more so than&#13;
had been feared or expected. Nevertheless, its performance can be faulted for&#13;
a number of reasons which may come to have even more relevance in the 1980s.&#13;
Needless to say, the imperfections of the capital market have existed long&#13;
before the oil crisis; they just make it more difficult to handle. It should&#13;
also be added that many of the judgments in this area are highly controversial&#13;
and that very little empirical work has been done on these issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
The presumption underlying criticisms of the world capital market&#13;
is that all countries, including the rich countries, would be better off with&#13;
increased flows to the NDCs than without. In other words, the criticism is&#13;
not that the capital market is not altruistic, but that it does not measure up&#13;
to its own criterion of maximizing world efficiency. The argument assumes,&#13;
not uncontroversially, that the NDCs have substantial unexploited "capacity to&#13;
absorb," that is, the rate of return on the extra capital flows would be high&#13;
enough to permit repayment of the loans in the long run at market rates of&#13;
interest. This misallocation of world capital occurs not merely as a long-run&#13;
matter, but also in the matter of medium-run, balance-of-payments finance for&#13;
adjusting to the oil shock. Current account adjustment is of course ultimately&#13;
required, but that statement leaves open what the speed of adjustment should&#13;
be. Slow adjustment is less painful and less disruptive of growth, and given&#13;
favorable circumstances, deficit countries can repay the loans contracted at&#13;
market rates. The claim in favor of public intervention in the world capital&#13;
market is that these favorable circumstances exist, especially in view of the&#13;
unexploited investment opportunities in capital-poor countries.&#13;
One manifestation of capital market imperfection is the country&#13;
distribution of capital flows. For example, if we look at gross Euromarket&#13;
lending to the NDCs in 1979, about 60 percent of it is accounted for by only&#13;
four countries--Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and South Korea. The position is&#13;
even more dramatic if we look at net lending by the banks. (Net lending is&#13;
clearly different from gross lending because the NDCs are depositors as well&#13;
as borrowers from the Eurobanks.) The same four countries accounted for more&#13;
than 90 percent of net lending to the NDCs in the same year. Indeed, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
low-income NDCs turn out to have been net lenders to the Eurobanks in 1979. 1/&#13;
Even if we assume (not necessarily correctly) that the rate of return on&#13;
capital is too low in the low-income NDCs, it is difficult to believe that it&#13;
is so low in the middle-income NDCs as to justify such a skewed distribution&#13;
of capital flows. Another manifestation of capital market imperfections,&#13;
apart from actual or threatened shortage of the quantity of capital flows&#13;
towards capital-poor countries, is the maturity distributidn of the capital&#13;
flows, which is overwhelmingly biased towards short- and medium-term loans.&#13;
Since development is a long-term process (it is not realistic to expect a net&#13;
reverse transfer of capital from the NDCs for at least fifty years), loans&#13;
which have to be rolled over frequently are unsuitable since the ease of&#13;
obtaining the rollovers is sensitive to random changes in a country's payments&#13;
position which alter the market's perception of its creditworthiness.&#13;
The significance of these difficulties is that they result in the&#13;
growth rate in the NDCs (and therefore in the world economy as well) being&#13;
lower than it need be. If the NDCs face a shortage in the supply of finance&#13;
or excessively hard terms, they are forced to cut back their development&#13;
programs; this is so a fortiori if the ICs are pursuing restrictive and&#13;
protective policies. The adjustment in real expenditure has to be immediate,&#13;
painful, and disruptive. There is also a non-zero probability of interruptions&#13;
in the supply of capital leading to defaults by the NDCs and thence to a major&#13;
collapse of the world credit structure.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
We now discuss briefly possible reasons for world capital market&#13;
failures which are reflected in lending to the NDCs, which is deficient in&#13;
quantity, excessively short-term in maturity, and excessively concentrated&#13;
in country-distribution.&#13;
*         The excessive concentration of private lending to the NDCs is&#13;
arguably the result partly of ignorance and partly of excessive risk-aversion.&#13;
Capital market institutions do not know enough about the economies of NDCs to&#13;
be able to lend to them with confidence. Otherwise, it is difficult to&#13;
explain why, even among the middle-income NDCs, lending is so skewed.&#13;
*         Some of the deficiency in the quantity of capital flows could&#13;
perhaps be explained by official regulation and interference on both sides of&#13;
the market. Lender governments may prefer to lend to some countries rather&#13;
than others for non-commercial reasons. They may also impose constraints on&#13;
the activities of financial institutions, such as the regulations in the&#13;
United States restricting the proportion of a bank's capital that can be at&#13;
risk to any single sovereign borrower. Many IC governments also imposed&#13;
constraints on access to their capital markets, sometimes for balance-of-&#13;
payments reasons: at other times the restrictions are aimed at protecting&#13;
depositors, but end up discriminating against NDC borrowers who cannot fulfil&#13;
various cumbersome conditions. Restrictions imposed by borrower governments&#13;
may also limit capital flows. For example, borrower governments may directly&#13;
or indirectly limit borrowing by the nation below what it could and should be&#13;
on economic criteria because they wish to be autarkic, or because they take&#13;
an unduly pessimistic view about the difficulty of servicing the debt. It is&#13;
difficult to believe that official intervention on either side of the market&#13;
is a major source of deficiencies in capital flows. As far as the lending&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
side is concerned, offshore markets are relatively free of official interven-&#13;
tion. Moreover, some supervision over the international activities of banks&#13;
cannot be regarded as necessarily producing inefficiency.&#13;
As far as the borrowing side is concerned, some governments, such&#13;
as India, may well have been reticent about borrowing in the world capital&#13;
market. But the NDCs' need for finance has been, and is, so acute that it&#13;
is difficult to ascribe much significance to this phenomenon.&#13;
*         The ability of international borrowers, particularly sovereign&#13;
governments, to default on loans creates an "adverse selection problem" which&#13;
is a major source of market imperfection and limits capital flows to the NDCs.&#13;
The problem arises from the fact that the allocation of credit cannot be left&#13;
to the interest rate mechanism since "dishonest borrowers" would borrow as&#13;
much as possible regardless of interest rates and default at a suitable&#13;
moment from their standpoint. Faced with such a problem, compounded by&#13;
sovereign risk, international banks can be expected to protect themselves by&#13;
rationing credit to all borrowers. The maximum safe level for lending to a&#13;
particular country would be such that the total benefit of default (which&#13;
varies positively with the size of the debt) just equals the total cost of&#13;
default (which arises from the exclusion from future borrowing and hence&#13;
inability to use borrowing to smooth future variations in income and&#13;
consumption). 1/&#13;

Review of Economic Studies, 1981.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
*         In contrast to the thrust of the immediately preceding point, it has&#13;
sometimes been alleged that the world capital market is subject to what&#13;
is known in the insurance literature as a "moral hazard problem." The idea is&#13;
that international public institutions and even national governments provide&#13;
an implicit guarantee which ensures that a sovereign borrower will not be&#13;
bankrupted or at least that bank lending to a bankrupt borrower will be bailed&#13;
out. This leads to excessive lending to the NDCs. I do not myself believe&#13;
that the significance of this point is very great. There is certainly some&#13;
evidence to suggest that banks have increased lending to some countries much&#13;
too rapidly at certain times. But the evidence also suggests extremely rapid&#13;
withdrawal of such lending as soon as servicing difficulties appear, which does&#13;
not accord with the theory that banks believe in the existence of a giant,&#13;
invisible international insurance system. 1/ Bank lending would appear to&#13;
be occasionally erratic, rather than excessive.&#13;
*         A further shortcoming of the market is its insufficient flexibility&#13;
in dealing with the problems created by inflation. Inflation has destroyed&#13;
the market for genuinely long-term loans. (Loans of more than ten years'&#13;
maturity are now insignificant in magnitude, a contrast from the pre-First&#13;
World War situation.) It is natural that fixed, nominal-interest, long-term&#13;
loans should decline during a period of high inflation. High inflation tends&#13;
to be variable inflation; a fixed-rate loan imposes heavy losses on borrowers&#13;
or lenders if the rate of inflation changes. The market answer to this&#13;

Occasional Paper no. 3, by B. Nowzad, R. Williams, et al.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
problem has been the floating interest loan. From the lender's point of view,&#13;
this seems perfectly satisfactory. From the borrower's point of view, however,&#13;
it is less than satisfactory because a high rate of inflation with a compensat-&#13;
ing increase in the rate of interest creates a cash flow problem for him in&#13;
the early years of the loan. If a high nominal interest rate is combined with&#13;
short maturity, real amortization per year--and therefore, the debt service/&#13;
exports ratio--can reach very high levels indeed even if the debt/exports&#13;
ratio and the debt/GNP ratio remain moderate.&#13;
The danger in this situation arises from the fact that a random&#13;
adverse change in the borrower's circumstances can cause a panic that lenders&#13;
will pull out. 1/   In fact, short maturities do not improve the lenders'&#13;
collective position either. Each particular lender may feel he can foreclose&#13;
if the borrowing country appears to be in trouble, but the average lender is&#13;
no more secure since a number of foreclosures would make the country bankrupt.&#13;
The theoretical solution to this problem is of course indexed loans, and the&#13;
market can be criticized for being insufficiently flexible to introduce such&#13;
an innovation fully or partially.&#13;
The above discussion focuses on a crucial point, namely that the&#13;
short-term nature of loans would not matter if there were greater certainty&#13;
that they would be rolled over. Perhaps the most important criticism of the&#13;
capital market is that it can easily create panic and uncertainty about&#13;
rollovers, and this probably arises out of a deep-seated propensity on the&#13;
part of financial market institutions to employ inappropriate criteria in&#13;
assessing risk. Economists are accustomed to assessing ability to repay by&#13;

checking whether the present value of assets exceeds the present value of&#13;
liabilities and, at the margin, whether the present value of the extra&#13;
investment discounted at the market rate of interest exceeds zero. This&#13;
measure has no necessary relationship with the usual debt ratios. On the one&#13;
hand, for example, a country with a high debt service ratio may pass the&#13;
present value criterion even if it has to borrow to meet its debt service&#13;
payments in the short-run. (Conversely, a low debt service ratio is not&#13;
necessarily an indication of positive present value.) Banks, on the other&#13;
hand, are apt to focus on a borrower's cash flow situation, in addition to or&#13;
instead of his net present value position. A borrower has a cash problem if&#13;
he cannot meet his payments obligations on schedule; at the international&#13;
level, this means not being able to make interest and amortization payments on&#13;
schedule. Economists tend to assume that it is the ability to pay interest&#13;
which is crucial since it is an indicator of whether revenues exceed costs&#13;
inter-temporally; the amortization can be covered by borrowing in a perfect&#13;
capital market. However, capital markets are far from perfect in this sense;&#13;
many of the debt problems of the NDCs stem from the fact that their liquidity&#13;
difficulties--many of them imposed on them by recession in or protectionism by&#13;
the ICs--threaten to disrupt their borrowing programs even if they are credit-&#13;
worthy over the long run.&#13;

III. Assessment of Some Relevant Factors Affecting the Impact of the&#13;
Second Oil Price Increase on the NDCs&#13;
The oil price increase of 1973 was handled relatively smoothly.&#13;
The important question is whether this has generated a false sense of&#13;
security. Is the situation likely to be materially different this time&#13;
round?&#13;
OEC Behavior&#13;
NDC financing and adjustment problems are likely to be worse&#13;
in comparison with the first oil price increase for the following reasons:&#13;
*         The last time, the OECs allowed the real price of oil to fall over&#13;
the years. This time, the OECs are likely to take a much more aggressive&#13;
attitude towards oil pricing.and supplies in order to prevent their terms-of-&#13;
trade improvement being eroded by inflation in the ICs. The extent to which&#13;
oil prices can be increased obviously depends on political and military&#13;
developments in the Middle East. The OECs have learned, however, that since&#13;
the spot market registers any expected scarcity promptly and sharply they&#13;
can, to some extent, appear to be following a lead given by the market. Saudi&#13;
Arabia, with its large reserves, plays a dovish role within the OECs, but it&#13;
can do so only if it is producing below its full capacity. If some oil&#13;
sources in the Middle East are interrupted for political reasons and the Saudi&#13;
Arabian production slack vanishes, Saudi Arabia will cease to be able to&#13;
moderate the price.&#13;
*         OECs may be more cautious about internal spending programs this&#13;
time. Last time, there was a fantastic growth in OEC imports, though it was&#13;
noticeable that the OEC surplus declined sharply in 1977-78 when OEC export&#13;
revenue growth slowed down.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
*          Underlying the optimistic assessment of the oil price rise is&#13;
the feeling that OECs have to place the surpluses with the world capital market&#13;
so that there cannot be a financing problem. Leaving aside the objection that&#13;
if the capital market does not recycle the surpluses, surpluses could be&#13;
eroded by deflation, there is the further point that OECs have another option:&#13;
leaving oil in the ground. Optimal portfolio management on the part of the&#13;
OECs clearly requires that this option should be explicitly considered.&#13;
The real return that OECs have earned on their financial assets&#13;
during the 1970s has Anot been above zero. Clearly, OECs may take the view that&#13;
it is more profitable to leave oil in the ground. Ironically, the effect of&#13;
such a supply restriction would be to raise the oil price and to increase the&#13;
OEC surplus--unless the production cut is taken entirely by the low absorbers&#13;
and the expenditure of the high absorbers increases pari passu with their&#13;
increased export revenue. Thus, the OECs would appear to have the possibility&#13;
of having their cake and eating it too; by making such a move they could&#13;
increase their surpluses and conserve more of their wealthl Obviously, the&#13;
OECs could not pursue this strategy. The long-run elasticity of demand for oil&#13;
has to be watched: the low absorbers who have the oil reserves stand to lose&#13;
most by substitution against oil. Moreover, raising the oil price sufficiently&#13;
to cause real dislocation in the ICs with the possibility of a massive defla-&#13;
tion is hardly likely to promote the OECs' economic interests, quite apart from&#13;
inviting military retaliation. Nevertheless, a more aggressive supply manage-&#13;
ment policy than hitherto can surely be expected from the OECs in the 1980s,&#13;
unless a price agreement with the OECs can be engineered in return for a more&#13;
assured return to OEC financial assets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
Even with feasible economies in oil consumption, the prognosis&#13;
must be that the oil market will remain tight in the 1980s and that OEC&#13;
surpluses will be more resistant than they were. Of course, OEC surpluses&#13;
could be eroded by a prolonged recession in the ICs or by a world recession&#13;
caused by recycling difficulties; both these possibilities would bear very&#13;
harshly on the NDCs.&#13;
IC Behavior&#13;
Reflection on the likely possibilities concerning economic policy&#13;
in the ICs does not provide much comfort for NDC prospects.&#13;
*         It seems very unlikely that the larger Organisation for Economic&#13;
Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries will grow any faster over the next&#13;
five years than they did over the previous seven. In fact, it is difficult to&#13;
see them growing faster than at about 2 percent per annum. To begin with,&#13;
there may be some long-run structural factors involved, reducing the growth&#13;
rate of potential output. In the main, the explanation is to be found in the&#13;
restrictive policy stance of IC governments. Inflation in the ICs is proving&#13;
resistant to policy cure and, though slow growth of productivity, particularly&#13;
in the United States, is a contributing factor to this failure, the only short-&#13;
term remedy that governments are choosing to employ is monetary deceleration&#13;
and restrictive demand management. The political tolerance of unemployment&#13;
has also increased.   At the same time, the attitude toward energy price&#13;
increases has changed. After the first oil price rise, some IC governments&#13;
resisted its deflationary impact by partially de-taxing in real terms. Now&#13;
there is much greater readiness to let the deflationary impact of the oil&#13;
price rise pass through. There is also wide-spread disenchantment with&#13;
exchange rate depreciation as an adjustment device in that it is seen to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
encourage inflation: on the contrary, there is a tilt towards a belief in the&#13;
"virtuous circle" engendered by monetary restriction and exchange appreciation.&#13;
While the IC countries will probably grow at around 2 percent per&#13;
annum, they are nevertheless expected to run current account deficits for&#13;
longer. However, these current deficits will be almost entirely attributable&#13;
to the fact that the real oil price will be rising; that is, they will not&#13;
reflect increased NDC exports or reduced NDC current deficits. The probable&#13;
scenario is that the ICs will grow more slowly but run bigger deficits and&#13;
that the NDCs, if they are not to reduce their growth rates sharply, will have&#13;
to run bigger deficits.&#13;
Developments in international liquidity creation are crucial to&#13;
whether the NDCs will be able to run current account deficits of adequate&#13;
magnitude. The reason is that the recycling of OEC surpluses through the&#13;
Western banking system to the NDCs involves creating international liquidity.&#13;
The mechanism is that on the one hand short-term OEC deposits in Euromarkets&#13;
are counted as part of OEC reserves; on the other hand, longer-term borrowing&#13;
by the NDCs from the market also adds to their reserves or enables them to&#13;
finance deficits without reducing their reserves. The posture of monetary&#13;
policy of the OECD countries, particularly the United States, is crucial to&#13;
this whole process. If monetary policy in the United States is tight, funds&#13;
are pulled into the United States, and its current deficit could be covered by&#13;
capital inflows rather than by an increase in its liabilities to foreign&#13;
official agencies. The real counterpart of this is that the relative profit-&#13;
ability of lending to the United States would increase, the supply of lending&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
to NDCs (and hence world liquidity) would decrease, and therefore the NDCs- ex&#13;
ante deficits would not materialize ex post and they would be forced to grow&#13;
more slowly. During the years 1973-79, monetary policy in the OECD countries&#13;
was relatively easy; there was no nominal money contraction, and governments&#13;
followed stop-go policies. Since 1979, United States monetary restriction has&#13;
increased sharply in severity, and most OECD governments intend to maintain the&#13;
severity over a substantial length of time in order to combat inflation.&#13;
Likelihood of a Recycling Problem in the 1980s&#13;
A "recycling problem" can exist only in relation to certain&#13;
specified objectives. In an ex post sense, there is obviously no recycling&#13;
problem because growth rates and capacity utilization adjust to whatever&#13;
capital flows are forthcoming. To answer such a question definitely, a&#13;
reliable quantitative model is obviously necessary. All we can do here is&#13;
comment on the results of the model underlying the World Bank's World Develop-&#13;
ment Report 1980, hereafter referred to as WDR III. The accompanying table&#13;
summarizes the results. (This table is the same as Table SA.7, page 101,&#13;
World Department Report 1980.) The following comments are warranted.&#13;
*         The table is constructed on the basis of "high-case" assumptions,&#13;
viz., per annum GNP growth of 3.3 percent and 4.0 percent for the ICs between&#13;
1980-85 and 1985-90 respectively, and 4.7 percent and 5.5 percent for the NDCs&#13;
for the same periods. Even accepting these assumptions, there are the following&#13;
notable features.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
*         As far as the low-income NDCs are concerned, these growth rates&#13;
of GNP require an increase of 123 percent in annual net inflows of medium- and&#13;
long-term capital (MLT) at current prices from public sources comparing 1985&#13;
with 1980; in 1990, the increase would have to be 27 percent. At constant&#13;
prices, the increase has to be approximately 75 percent by 1985 and about 175&#13;
percent by 1990. These increases imply both a much more rapid growth of the&#13;
concessional component of public capital than hitherto (leading to a somewhat&#13;
higher ODA/GNP ratio for the ICs) and a redistribution of official development&#13;
assistance (ODA) flows toward the low-income countries. It is not at all&#13;
clear that the present aid climate (influenced to some extent by the outcome&#13;
of the United States presidential elections) is favorable to such a development.&#13;
The figures for private flows to the low-income countries show quite a sharp&#13;
increase in real terms between 1985-90.&#13;
*         Turning to the middle-income NDCs, the table implies an increase in&#13;
annual net public MLT capital flows in real terms of about 25 percent by 1985&#13;
and about 65 percent by 1990. The remarks made above about ODA flows apply&#13;
mutatis mutandis in this case. The figures also show a decline in annual net&#13;
private flows in real terms over the same periods. Given the prevailing&#13;
uncertainties about the supply of private finance, this seems very encouraging.&#13;
However, it must be realized that these are net figures and that in gross&#13;
terms private capital flows almost certainly have to increase in real terms&#13;
over the two periods. (The calculation depends on the allocation of the total&#13;
amortization payments figure between public and private capital amortization.&#13;
If the allocation is done in the same proportion as the net capital flow&#13;
figures, the above statement is certainly true.) Here, our earlier discus-&#13;
sion about rollovers and liquidity constraints is relevant.&#13;

*         In fact, the high-case assumptions look much too optimistic.    Indeed,&#13;
even the low-case assumptions are unlikely to be fulfilled as far as the ICs&#13;
are concerned. (The low-case assumption is that the ICs will grow at about 3&#13;
percent per annum in both periods.) It is quite probable that the ICs will&#13;
grow at no higher than about 2 percent per annum during 1980-85, for the&#13;
reasons given earlier. This would change the figures in the table drastically.&#13;
It would mean much lower export growth for the NDCs and therefore much higher&#13;
current account deficits for them if they are to keep growing at high-case&#13;
rates. Moreover, high-case aid projections are then most unlikely to be&#13;
fulfilled, which means that much greater burden would be thrown on to private&#13;
capital flows. Unless the capital market functions in such a way as to&#13;
maintain the willingness of the OECs to lend and the NDCS to borrow much&#13;
larger sums of money than implied by the table, the NDCs will not be able to&#13;
achieve high-case growth rates. A fortiori, these remarks apply if growth&#13;
rates even higher than high-case growth rates are postulated for the NDCs on&#13;
humanitarian grounds.&#13;
*         Concern has also been expressed that adequate recycling may not&#13;
take place because banks are undercapitalized and are overexposed in some&#13;
countries as judged by certain regulations and rules of thumb. While this&#13;
concern can be exaggerated, the probability of its coming true is obviously&#13;
greater than zero. The main danger here is that with high and positive real&#13;
interest rates and low growth in the ICs, the debt-service ratios of the&#13;
NDCs will worsen and lead to banks becoming unwilling to lend.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
The Desirability of Rapid IC Growth from the NDC Viewpoint&#13;
It is evident from our previous discussion that, from the point of&#13;
view of the NDCs, the ICs should grow rapidly. We now discuss some objections&#13;
to this conclusion.&#13;
*         It is sometimes contended that while rapid IC growth increases&#13;
NDC exports and therefore reduces NDC current deficits and NDC financing&#13;
needs, it also increases IC deficits and increases IC financing needs. IC&#13;
financing needs create greater "competition for funds" in capital markets,&#13;
and this unfavorable monetary effect may outweigh the favorable real effect&#13;
through increased NDC exports. While NDC financing needs are reduced for a&#13;
given growth rate, the availability of funds may be reduced even more because&#13;
of competitition from the ICs. This objection is invalid in its simple form&#13;
because it assumes a fixed OEC surplus. The OEC surplus would be higher with&#13;
more rapid IC growth, thereby increasing the flow of funds through the capital&#13;
market.&#13;
*         A different objection is that slower growth by the ICs, and hence&#13;
bigger deficits for the NDCs, does not matter because the deficits will be&#13;
financed: and if the financing is available, it is contended, bigger deficits&#13;
for the NDCs are better than smaller deficits. Consider this objection in two&#13;
steps, depending on whether the financing is on the basis of concessional aid&#13;
or on commercial terms.&#13;
*         If financing is in the form of concessional aid, the argument&#13;
becomes simply the old "trade-versus-aid" issue in a different guise. Of&#13;
course, if aid is available to fill a larger current deficit, it is better&#13;
than increased exports and a smaller current deficit, since the resources&#13;
which were used to produce exports could be diverted to increase domestic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
consumption or investment. Even this argument, however, is subject to the&#13;
objection that export growth may in many instances be a much cheaper way of&#13;
transforming available resources into desired resources than home-biased&#13;
methods of transformation. Primary products for which export demand has&#13;
declined could not easily be switched towards home use. Of course, in theory,&#13;
if *the aid is available as a pure grant, then it is worth accepting it in&#13;
preference to increased exports so long as there is a positive return to the&#13;
resources saved in export production. But making use of increased aid has its&#13;
own problems and indeed may even have some negative effects. The most important&#13;
point is, of course, that the increased current deficits of the NDCs caused&#13;
by slower IC growth are most unlikely to be filled by concessional aid.&#13;
Indeed, in many NDCs with relatively high saving rates, the likelihood is that&#13;
if export growth fell, savings would be "wasted" in the short run and would&#13;
not occur ex post. (The distinction between the saving gap and the foreign&#13;
exchange gap has probably more relevance now than when it was first formulated.)&#13;
*         If financing is on commercial terms, the case for NDCs acquiring&#13;
resources through trade becomes stronger because the borrowing has to be&#13;
serviced. If markets work efficiently, it could be said that, at the margin,&#13;
the return to using resources from export production would equal the return to&#13;
using resources for home use, so that extra borrowing would not alter the&#13;
position. However, the return to resources used in home production may&#13;
fall very sharply, making borrowing unprofitable. Moreover, many NDCs cannot&#13;
borrow at market rates or are faced with capital rationing. Even if they have&#13;
access to capital markets, they may face rollover difficulties when they have&#13;
larger current deficits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
The basic point can be put as follows. Increases in NDC growth&#13;
will result in much bigger NDC current account deficits if the ICs are&#13;
stagnant than if the ICs are growing fast. The reason is that either&#13;
case involves a higher NDC current deficit with OECs, but NDCs' current&#13;
deficit with ICs is higher in the former case than in the latter. If we add&#13;
to this the fact that stagnation in IC growth tends to worsen NDC terms of&#13;
trade, it is really quite clear that maintaining high rates of growth in the&#13;
NDCs would involve a much higher ratio of current account deficits to GNP if&#13;
the ICs are stagnant than if the ICs are growing. The significance of this&#13;
point is, of course, that the higher the rates of current account deficit to&#13;
GNP, the greater the financing difficulties are likely to be, especially with&#13;
imperfect capital markets, and hence the greater the chance of the assumed&#13;
growth rate not being realized.&#13;
A further point needs to be made in the context of recent discus-&#13;
sion of "massive transfers" to the NDCs. Whether massive transfers refer to&#13;
aid or commercial capital flows, it should be noted that stagnation and low&#13;
growth in the ICs make massive transfers virtually impossible. The reason is&#13;
that increased NDC growth would lead to increased demand, not merely for oil&#13;
from the OEC but for other goods from the ICs. In order to satisfy this demand,&#13;
the ICs would have to run a current account surplus with the NDCs by cutting&#13;
current real expenditure. Such a cut is very difficult to undertake in&#13;
economies where the standard of living is growing very slowly.&#13;
In the longer run, the connection between IC growth and NDC growth&#13;
can be loosened if the collective import propensity of the NDCs can be&#13;
lowered by a significant expansion of intra-NDC trade. In the near-term,&#13;
however, this is not a plausible escape-route.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
*         There is one objection to the recommendation of higher IC growth&#13;
which must be taken seriously: it is that it would lead to further increases&#13;
in the oil price which would make the problems of NDCs worse. There is no&#13;
doubt that if the effect on the oil price is very large, the unfavorable&#13;
impact on the NDCs would outweigh the favorable impact from higher IC growth.&#13;
This scenario is probably too gloomy, but it underlines the need to come to an&#13;
agreement with the OECs about the manner in which real prices should rise over&#13;
the next decade.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
IV. International Public Intervention&#13;
The case for international public intervention has two distinct&#13;
strands, one based on altruism, the other on self-interest.&#13;
*         The altruistic case is simply the moral argument for redistri-&#13;
bution from rich to poor countries. An internationally agreed target rate of&#13;
growth of living standards in the poor countries (the NDCs) would imply that&#13;
aid flows should be forthcoming on a certain scale. On this argument, it&#13;
would follow that if the prospects of the NDCs worsen because of the oil price&#13;
increase, aid flows to the NDCs should increase.&#13;
*         The argument of self-interest is that all countries, including&#13;
the rich ICs, would be better off if the failures of international markets,&#13;
specifically international capital markets, could be offset. Two sub-cases&#13;
may be distinguished. (a) International coordination of demand-management&#13;
policy may be required to prevent a world recession or world inflation&#13;
which is to nobody's benefit. Specifically, demand-management policy in the&#13;
ICs is of key importance for the world economy because of their economic&#13;
weight. (b) Some international intervention may be required to affect the&#13;
nature and direction of capital flows both to prevent world recession/inflation&#13;
and to allocate the world's capital stock efficiently. Specifically, in the&#13;
context of this paper, it could be argued that for any given IC growth rate,&#13;
the volume of capital flows to the NDCs should be increased and their maturity&#13;
lengthened in order to maximize world efficiency. This argument is, in&#13;
principle, quite separate from the aid argument; the capital flows are&#13;
at market interest rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
We now discuss these arguments in turn. The separation is for&#13;
analytical purposes. Many suggested methods of intervening in world capital&#13;
markets have aspects which would fall under more than one category.&#13;
International Redistribution from Rich to Poor Countries&#13;
*         As is well known, ODA from the ICs is currently about one-third&#13;
of 1 percent of GNP. The OEC aid record is much better, though it has&#13;
worsened recently. At least as far as the low-income NDCs are concerned, the&#13;
moral case for an increase in aid to preserve living standards is surely&#13;
overwhelming. What is more, the absolute amounts that would be required to&#13;
cover the increased "oil deficits" of the low-income NDCs are trivially&#13;
small in terms of IC or OEC capacity to pay.&#13;
There is also some scope for redistributing existing aid flows&#13;
toward the low-income NDCs. But it would not be easy because it would have to&#13;
be done largely through changing the political preferences of the large donors&#13;
such as the United States. Most of the smaller donors already give more than&#13;
two-thirds of their aid to the low-income NDCs. Moreover, it must be&#13;
remembered that a significant proportion of the aid which goes to the middle-&#13;
income NDCs is directed to countries at the lower end of the middle-income&#13;
scale. Thus, effective international redistribution at the present time is&#13;
more a matter of increasing aid flows than of reallocating existing aid&#13;
flows.&#13;
*         Aid can be increased in many ways, some more explicit than others.&#13;
The operations of the existing multilateral international institutions are to&#13;
be seen mainly as improving the efficiency of the world capital market, but&#13;
their lending does have some redistributive element. This is particularly&#13;
true of regular International Monetary Fund (IMF) lending which contains some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
subsidy in comparison with market rates though the beneficiaries of the&#13;
subsidy are of course all Fund borrowers, not just the NDCs. The Special&#13;
Drawing Rights (SDR) creation by the Fund also involves an element of subsidy&#13;
to net users of SDR (who are mainly NDCs), even though the interest rate on&#13;
the SDR is now (almost certainly) going to be raised to bring it in line with&#13;
market deposit rates. This is because market lending rates are higher than&#13;
deposit rates, particularly for the NDCs.&#13;
It must be mentioned here that the process of international liquidity&#13;
creation, heretofore, has involved some "reverse resource transfer" from the&#13;
NDCs to the ICs. As is well known, an overwhelming proportion of the nongold&#13;
increase in international liquidity has consisted of the monetary liabilities&#13;
of the major ICs, principally the United States. In so far as this increase&#13;
can be directly related to the balance-of-payments deficits of the ICs, there&#13;
was a resource transfer toward them since the productivity of the extra&#13;
investment made possible by the deficits exceeded the interest rate on the&#13;
liabilities incurred in financing the deficits, especially during a period&#13;
when real interest rates were negative. Of course, insofar as the increase in&#13;
nongold reserves is the result of Euromarket activity, the matter is more&#13;
complicated. Just as evidently, there has been reverse resource transfer to&#13;
the ICs as a result of the massive increase in the value of the gold component&#13;
of the reserves. Of course, the extent of realizable wealth transfer is&#13;
uncertain because sales of gold by monetary authorities would drive down the&#13;
price of gold to an unpredictable extent.&#13;
The SDR link was envisaged as a modest attempt to distribute the&#13;
seignorage from international liquidity creation to the developing countries,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
but it did not see the light of day. Of course, the resource transfer in the&#13;
SDR link depends crucially upon keeping the SDR interest rate below market&#13;
borrowing rates, a requirement which conflicts with the need to have a&#13;
competitive interest rate on the SDR in order to promote its acceptability to&#13;
net holders. The resource transfer aspect has become much diluted by the&#13;
recent decision to increase the SDR interest rate. As mentioned above,&#13;
however, some subsidy, and therefore some resource transfer, is still embodied&#13;
in the SDR, and an SDR link therefore remains important from the NDC point of&#13;
view.&#13;
The really important feature of the SDR, and a fortiori of the&#13;
SDR link for the NDCs, is that it provides a fiduciary reserve asset which,&#13;
though liable to an interest cost if spent, does not have to be refinanced.&#13;
It thus can play an important role in the recycling process when the capital&#13;
market is imperfect. We return to this question in a later section.&#13;
*         Interest subsidies, as a method of aid transfer, are of some&#13;
importance   In principle, a direct grant to a country should serve just as&#13;
well as an interest subsidy because the recipient country would have the&#13;
option of raising market loans, using the grant to make up the difference&#13;
between the market rate of interest and the rate it can afford to pay. In&#13;
practice, interest subsidies may have some advantages over direct grants.&#13;
One advantage, though the recipient may not regard it as such, is that the&#13;
donors can tie interest subsidies to loans which have some conditionality&#13;
attached to them or which have to be used for purposes the donors regard as&#13;
productive. Examples of such tying would be interest subsidies on extended&#13;
fund facility (EFF) loans, or on World Bank lending of the Third Window&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
type, or interest subsidies on SDRs with IMF conditionality attached. Of&#13;
course, such tying cannot be foolproof because recipient countries can switch&#13;
other funds in their possession to desired purposes. Another advantage of&#13;
interest subsidies, particularly on market loans to developing countries (LDCs)&#13;
is that they encourage mutual familiarity between the LDCs and the world&#13;
capital market.&#13;
Interest subsidies could be disbursed in a number of different&#13;
ways: (a) to recipient countries directly, (b) to multilateral official&#13;
institutions to enable them to lend at low rates but borrow at market rates,&#13;
and (c) to private sector banks to enable them to make loans at low rates.&#13;
The last-mentioned method has the advantage from the donor governments point&#13;
of view in that donors can preserve greater say over loan allocations than is&#13;
possible through multilateral disbursement.&#13;
It must be appreciated that interest subsidies are relatively&#13;
expensive and require either an assured annual stream of income or a capi-&#13;
talized lump sum set aside for the purpose. The cost of giving interest&#13;
subsidies can be illustrated by the fact that a lump-sum, interest-subsidy&#13;
fund of US$100 would be required to enable $300 to be lent for twenty-five&#13;
years at 4 percent if the market rate of interest is 8 percent. Interest sub-&#13;
sidies may have other disadvantages: (a) part of the benefit of the interest&#13;
subsidies may accrue to the intermediaries since interest rates may be pushed&#13;
up by the increased demand for loans: and (b) interest subsidies may give the&#13;
wrong signals from the point of view of resource allocation, unless the recip-&#13;
ient government uses shadow prices for capital in evaluating government pro-&#13;
jects and passes on the interest subsidy to private sector firms as a grant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
rather than as a change in the price of capital. In spite of the problems&#13;
raised by interest subsidies, it may be easier to raise money for interest&#13;
subsidies than for direct grants if donor governments or multilateral institu-&#13;
tions can, in return, acquire some influence over the recipients' economic&#13;
policies. So long as this influence is not expressed in a narrow, rigid, or&#13;
ideologically simplistic manner, it may be beneficial for international&#13;
adjustment.&#13;
Are there any possible sources for an interest-subsidy fund,&#13;
apart from voluntary contributions by governments? (Voluntary contributions&#13;
raise the question of additionality of aid in a quite direct way.) One&#13;
possibility, which has been canvassed by the Brandt Commission Report, 1/ is&#13;
additional gold sales by the IMF, whose gold holdings amount to approximately&#13;
100 million ounces. The sale of, say, 10 million ounces could easily create a&#13;
fund of US$3 billion. Another possible source is the proceeds of repayments of&#13;
IMF Trust Fund loans. The Trust Fund has disbursed more than US$3 billion;&#13;
however, the repayments on these loans will not reach sizable proportions till&#13;
the mid-1980s. Turning to the World Bank, its profits during fiscal years 1979&#13;
and 1980 were $400 million and $600 million, respectively. There are other&#13;
potential calls on these profits, but a part could obviously be used for the&#13;
provision of interest subsidies. Repayments of past International Development&#13;
Association (IDA) loans constitute another source for an interest-subsidy&#13;
fund. It must be noted that these schemes would principally benefit the&#13;
"blend countries" that is, those which currently receive a mixture of Inter-&#13;
national Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and IDA loans. The&#13;

poorest countries could not afford to borrow from the IBRD with interest rate&#13;
subsidies in the feasible range.&#13;
International Demand Management&#13;
From the NDCs point of view, demand expansion and higher growth&#13;
in the ICs enables the NDCs to either (a) grow faster without increasing their&#13;
current account deficits; or (b) have a smaller current deficit for any&#13;
specified growth rate. Either way, financing of NDC their current account&#13;
deficits would be easier because the ratio of current account deficit to GNP&#13;
would be lower, implying a higher probability that the current account deficits&#13;
are sustainable.&#13;
Naturally, the ICs cannot determine their appropriate internal&#13;
pressure of demand solely with reference to NDC interests. They will be&#13;
concerned to prevent inflation and to achieve adequate current account&#13;
adjustment. (World inflation also harms the NDCs.) A crucial question,&#13;
therefore, is whether the prevailing unemployment and slack in the ICs can&#13;
plausibly be justified as being required by the prevailing "natural rate of&#13;
unemployment," plus the margin required to bring down inflation gradually.&#13;
Many people believe that (i) currently unemployment is excessive on this&#13;
criterion; (ii) inflation is not amenable to demand reduction policies without&#13;
an intolerable amount of waste; and (iii) that the only long-run method of&#13;
achieving satisfactory economic performance is to radically reform the wage&#13;
bargaining process    It may be right to expand demand even taking a narrow IC&#13;
standpoint. Two further comments are in order:&#13;
*         While the ICs are bound to fix their internal pressure of demand&#13;
primarily with regard to their own objectives, they should, arguably, pay some&#13;
attention to the requirements of international adjustment. This is simply a&#13;
version of the old "symmetry" argument according to which equitable sharing of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
the burden of adjustment requires that surplus countries should expand and&#13;
deficit countries contract real expenditure. Of course, this rule has to be&#13;
modified in the present context because the OECs have a structural surplus in&#13;
the sense that their absorptive capacity is too low to permit productive use&#13;
of their surplus in the short run. They have perforce to lend most of it.&#13;
However, there is a case, in the interests of international adjustment, for&#13;
the ICs running bigger deficits than they would find unilaterally optimal.&#13;
*         If the ICs expand, a plausible argument can be constructed for&#13;
the view that it should be done by coordinated agreement. A single IC expanding&#13;
on its own is much more likely to face a depreciation-inflation spiral than a&#13;
group of major ICs doing it together.&#13;
In the context of capital flows to the NDCs, the relevant question&#13;
is whether an increase in such flows could set off a virtuous Keynesian&#13;
reflationary circle. But if such a possibility exists, why go about it in&#13;
such a roundabout way? Could IC governments not initiate expansion directly?&#13;
Even if a single IC government were to fear a depreciation-inflation spiral,&#13;
collective expansion by the ICs may be able to prevent that. It has certainly&#13;
more chance of doing so than an expansion generated in the NDCs, since the ICs&#13;
trade principally with each other. Of course, the reason the IC governments&#13;
do not expand is that they believe that increasing the pressure of demand&#13;
would make it impossible to bring inflation down. Now, they may be wrong in&#13;
this belief--and it is very probably true that unemployment in the ICs is&#13;
excessively high--but that does not mean they can be bamboozled into letting&#13;
the pressure of demand increase if the demand comes from the NDCs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
It follows, therefore, that there is very little, if anything, in&#13;
the international Keynesian argument for increased capital flows to the&#13;
NDCs. It is probably right to say that the ICs should expand, not merely&#13;
in the interest of the NDCs but in their own interest, but that can only be&#13;
done by persuading IC governments of the truth of this point of view.&#13;
International Capital Market Intervention&#13;
Even if there were agreement about the distribution and magnitude&#13;
of current account surpluses and deficits required in the world economy to&#13;
achieve feasible employment and growth targets, international capital market&#13;
intervention may be necessary to overcome market failures which could prevent&#13;
the achievement of the feasible outcome. We have discussed the possible&#13;
market failures in an earlier section; they are not the product of the oil&#13;
price increase, though it does underline the need to overcome them. We begin&#13;
by discussing briefly the traditional operations of the IMF and the World Bank&#13;
which are at present the international community's principal instruments for&#13;
correcting capital market failures. We then discuss various issues connected&#13;
with international capital market intervention, including the merits of some&#13;
new proposals.&#13;
The IMF&#13;
On even a cursory examination, two facts stand out. First, the Fund&#13;
has been a relatively minor source of balance-of-payments financing. (The&#13;
peak of Fund financing was in 1975, when Fund lending constituted about 5&#13;
percent of the total financial transfer to the NDCs. In 1978 and 1979, the&#13;
Fund-s net contribution was actually negative. In 1980, however, Fund lending&#13;
expanded rapidly.) Second, most of the borrowing from the Fund has been&#13;
through its low-conditionality facilities. These two facts suggest that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
Fund's mix of volume and conditionality of lending has left something to be&#13;
desired. We now comment briefly'on each of these.&#13;
NDC quotas amount to SDR19 billion. Theoretically, this implies&#13;
access to the Fund of more than SDR120 billion if all Fund facilities are&#13;
added together. That is, however, an enormous overstatement for several&#13;
reasons:&#13;
*         Usable, convertible currencies at the disposal of the Fund amount&#13;
to SDR43 billion, inclusive of the supplementary financing facility (SFF), and&#13;
to SDR35 billion if the SFF is discontinued.&#13;
*         The Fund's holdings of currencies will also be needed for lending&#13;
to ICs during the next few years, and some convertible currencies may become&#13;
unavailable for use since the relevant countries have deficit positions.&#13;
Moreover, it is difficult to imagine the Fund being fully loaned up. Hence,&#13;
it is difficult to imagine Fund liquid resources available for lending to NDCs&#13;
being larger than say half of the convertible currencies at the Fund's&#13;
disposal; that is, a maximum of SDR23 billion if the SFF is continued, and&#13;
SDR18 billion if the SFF is discontinued.&#13;
Thus, realistic total access of the NDCs to Fund credit is say&#13;
about SDR20 billion (unless augmented by further Fund borrowing), while the&#13;
annual current account deficit of the NDCs is expected to be three times as&#13;
large in 1980, and will be even larger in later years. Allowing for the&#13;
continuation of ODA flows, that still leaves a cumulative deficit, as estimated&#13;
by the World Bank, of about SDR250 billion over 1980-85 to be covered by&#13;
non-ODA flows. Indeed, the financing gap to be covered could be larger if&#13;
World Bank projections of IC growth turn out to be overestimates, as they&#13;
almost certainly will, and if there is a consequential effect on NDC exports&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
and terms of trade. In such a situation, the Fund could be very short of&#13;
lendable resources at a time when the world capital market would be least&#13;
able to cope. The "last resort" nature of the Fund means that it should be&#13;
able to increase lending quickly and in substantial amounts. The situation&#13;
has been somewhat improved by the IMF's recent decision to borrow 6-7 billion&#13;
SDR per year for the purpose of relending. If the financing gap of the NDCs,&#13;
net of ODA, is SDR250 billion, this means that the Fund could potentially&#13;
fill about SDR50 billion of it. (The basis of Fund lending could be made&#13;
even more secure by advancing the Eighth Review of quotas.)&#13;
Fund Conditionality&#13;
The Fund's typical low-conditionality facility is the compensatory&#13;
financing facility (CFF), which can be drawn upon to finance deficits related&#13;
to export shortfalls which are temporary and caused by factors beyond the&#13;
government's control. Of these three criteria, only government responsibility&#13;
has any relevance for the degree of conditionality, and even that criterion,&#13;
strictly speaking, should relate to the likelihood of future irresponsibility&#13;
by the government. Evidently, deficits that are wholly outside the government's&#13;
control can be caused by nonreversible, permanent changes; that is, by a&#13;
permanent rise in the import cost of oil. Under such circumstances, why&#13;
should low-conditionality financing not be provided in generous amounts?&#13;
(Obviously, if the change causing the deficit is permanent, the financing&#13;
would have to taper off over time.) These remarks are directly applicable to&#13;
the high-conditionality EFF (extended fund facility), which is the Fund's&#13;
answer to the phenomenon of structural balance-of-payments deficits.&#13;
It must be admitted, of course, that making government responsibility&#13;
for payments deficits the sole criterion for the degree of conditionality&#13;
would be difficult because it could be politically very s,ensitive, quite apart&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
from the fact that most real-life deficits cannot be neatly categorized as&#13;
caused by factors within or beyond the control of the government. However, it&#13;
is important to get the principle right before it is applied. At present,&#13;
the Fund's principle according to which the degree of conditionality is&#13;
related to the amounts borrowed and to the permanence or otherwise of the&#13;
deficits, serves to keep countries away from the Fund until private finance&#13;
has dried up and they are in desperate straits.&#13;
A related issue is the form of conditionality. Even when the&#13;
conditionality is tough, it is counterproductive to encapsulate it in rigid&#13;
or mechanical formulas.&#13;
Recasting--not necessarily diluting--Fund conditionality is one of&#13;
the major reforms required in present circumstances. These could go alongside&#13;
with (a) further liberalization of the CFF, making drawings available for&#13;
shortfalls lasting more than a year, calculating shortfalls in real terms, and&#13;
allowing drawings for shortfalls caused by rising import prices and (b)&#13;
further liberalization of the EFF by extending the financing period from three&#13;
to six years and the repayment period from ten to fifteen years. Unfortunately,&#13;
no really stable and significant increase in the Fund's lending potential is&#13;
possible without an increase in quotas.&#13;
To make balance-of-payments adjustment in present circumstances&#13;
less painful for the low-income NDCs, an interest-subsidy scheme could be&#13;
applied to the EFF. As discussed above, the money could be raised either&#13;
through direct budgetary contributions by member countries or through further&#13;
gold sales by the IMF. Both require international altruism; the latter route&#13;
would require altruism within the NDCs as well, since the middle-income NDCs&#13;
would have to forgo their share of the profit on gold sales.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
SDR Creation&#13;
It has become intellectually fashionable to downgrade the role of&#13;
the Fund in creating international liquidity in the current international&#13;
environment characterized by managed floating rates and high capital mobility.&#13;
It is recognized that governments have a well-founded reluctance to practice&#13;
clean floating and that floating has not reduced and has probably increased&#13;
the demand for reserves. But it is argued that any country which wishes to&#13;
acquire reserves can do so at the cost of some depreciation in its exchange&#13;
rate by intervening in the foreign exchange market; alternatively, it can&#13;
acquire reserves through foreign borrowing. From the NDC point of view,&#13;
however, receiving an issue of SDRs has many advantages over acquiring&#13;
reserves by the above methods. Acquiring reserves through exchange market&#13;
intervention can be a tricky business if the demand for foreign exchange is&#13;
relatively inelastic; the exchange rate may have to drop substantially with&#13;
severe domestic consequences. Some NDCs are denied the option of acquiring&#13;
reserves by borrowing: in this respect many of the ICs are luckier in that&#13;
they can accumulate reserves by simple changes in monetary policy.&#13;
Even for those NDCs which can borrow, however, there is the dis-&#13;
advantage that the loans not only have to be serviced but amortized. As we&#13;
have already seen, in an imperfect capital market, refinancing is always a&#13;
somewhat uncertain matter. SDRs, on the other hand, have the enormous&#13;
advantage that while net users have to pay interest (soon to equal market&#13;
rates) on them, they do not have to be amortized. (This is subject to certain&#13;
reconstitution requirements and acceptance limits which certainly should be&#13;
relaxed. Now that the SDR interest rate has been altered to equality with the&#13;
market rate, there should be no problem in doing so.) It should be noted that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
the value of world trade and the value of payments imbalances have gone up&#13;
sharply compared with what was predicted when the decisions concerning SDR&#13;
allocations in the third basic period (SDR4 billion per year from 1979-82)&#13;
were made. It is further expected that payments imbalances will continue to&#13;
be very large for several years beyond 1982. International liquidity will&#13;
obviously have to increase to accommodate these developments, and for the&#13;
reasons given above, there are good reasons why the share of SDRs in&#13;
international liquidity should be at least maintained and preferably increased.&#13;
On this basis, there is a good case for increasing the supply of SDRs by SDR6&#13;
billion to SDR10 billion per annum over the next few years. The often&#13;
expressed fear that SDR creation would be inflationary has little justification&#13;
since the SDRs would largely be substituted for currency reserves which would&#13;
be created in any case.&#13;
Going further, there is a good case at the moment for the SDR link,&#13;
that is, for allocating the whole of the increase in SDRs to NDCs or, at any&#13;
rate, allocating SDRs to the NDCs'in a higher proportion than implied by their&#13;
quotas. The case does not rest on increasing aid through the SDR link; as&#13;
seen above, this aspect of the SDR link is now much attenuated. The case is&#13;
simply that SDR creation is probably a more efficient recycling device for the&#13;
NDCs, especially the low-income NDCs, than foreign borrowing, since NDC&#13;
access to the capital market is both limited and subject to uncertainties of&#13;
refinancing. The surplus countries do not stand to lose by the SDR link since&#13;
the interest on excess holdings of SDRs is now fully competitive with the&#13;
market rate.&#13;
It is thus clear that the Fund could play an important role in&#13;
recycling during the 1980s through its conditional credit facilities and&#13;
through its creation of reserve assets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
The World Bank&#13;
In 1979, the Bank's total net disbursements were about US$3.8 billion&#13;
(IBRD $2.6 billion and IDA $1.2 billion) compared with net disbursements to the&#13;
NDCs from all sources of about US$65 billion. The maturity structure of IBRD&#13;
loans is reasonably good, on average about ten years. IDA gives genuinely&#13;
long-term loans. An important feature of Bank lending is its project-oriented&#13;
and hence slow-disbursing character.&#13;
Under its Articles, the Bank is empowered to make "program loans"&#13;
which can be disbursed quickly. In the last three years, these have&#13;
constituted only about 4 percent of Bank lending. But in the present climate&#13;
of uncertainty about the scale of private finance, there is an obvious&#13;
attraction in the idea of increasing such "structural adjustment loans." They&#13;
would be especially useful if used in conjunction with loans from the Fund's&#13;
EFF to enable well-articulated adjustment and growth strategies lasting&#13;
several years.&#13;
There are two difficulties with expansion of structural adjustment&#13;
loans. One difficulty, which is often mentioned, is the lack of expertise&#13;
in the Bank to evaluate structural adjustment programs. This is most&#13;
implausible. There is certainly no reason to believe that the Bank is not&#13;
equipped for the task, at any rate in comparison with other international&#13;
public agencies. The other and major difficulty undoubtedly concerns resource&#13;
availability. Expansion could only be at the expense of the.Bank's valuable&#13;
project-lending activities. The increase in the Bank's capital does, however,&#13;
open up an opportunity in this respect. Bank sources have indicated that it&#13;
should be easily possible to increase structural adjustment lending to US$1&#13;
billion per annum. In quantitative terms, this is a small sum, but it could&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
have a large impact, if directed to the right places, by improving the&#13;
creditworthiness of the recipient countries and thereby improving the&#13;
prospects for private lending.&#13;
Another suggestion which has often been voiced concerns the possi-&#13;
bility of Bank cofinancing with the private sector. In principle, access to&#13;
World Bank's project preparation and supervision should make private banks,&#13;
which are often not very well informed about the NDCs, interested in&#13;
cofinancing. This could increase the quantity and improve the maturity of&#13;
private capital flows.&#13;
So far, private cofinancing with the Bank has been very small,&#13;
about US$0.5 billion in 1979. Bank involvement does involve problems for both&#13;
borrowers and colenders. The cost of Bank project preparation and supervision&#13;
has to be covered, and Bank methods and project preparation are often different&#13;
and more exacting than those of private banks. Ultimately, whether cofinancing&#13;
results in "additionality" of capital flow depends on whether private banks&#13;
perceive Bank involvement as reducing their risks significantly. It has been&#13;
suggested that one way to reduce private risks is to strengthen the cross-&#13;
default clause so that a default against the colender is counted as a default&#13;
against the World Bank. There are, however, political limits to how much&#13;
strengthening of the cross-default clause the World Bank can realistically&#13;
entertain. On balance, it is very doubtful whether cofinancing would produce&#13;
additionality in the absence of a World Bank guarantee of the loans.&#13;
It can be expected that World Bank guarantees of private loans&#13;
would result in a net-addition to capital flows. The difficulty is that&#13;
under the World Bank's Articles of Agreement, Bank guarantees count fully&#13;
against its lending limit, so guarantees could only be at the expense of other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
lending. One possibility in this context is the extension of partial&#13;
guarantees which may suffice to attract new lenders who have so far been put&#13;
off by the credit risk of lending to the NDCs, but who do not face the&#13;
possible problem of having already accumulated a substantial amount of NDC&#13;
debt in their portfolio.&#13;
It is evident, however that the Bank can make a quantitatively&#13;
significant difference in the working of the world capital market only if its&#13;
overall lending capacity is significantly increased. The Bank has recently&#13;
had a capital increase, expanding its lending capacity to US$80 billion which&#13;
will permit it to increase its lending in real terms by 5 percent per annum&#13;
over the next five years. Some of this could be set aside for a partial&#13;
guarantee-cum-cofinancing program and for structural assistance lending. If&#13;
the Bank secures agreement of member countries for (say) a change in its&#13;
gearing ratio to 1:2, then the potential for such new departures by the Bank&#13;
would obviously be significantly increased.&#13;
At the moment, the Bank/Fund relationship is muddied by demarca-&#13;
tion disputes. In the context of structural assistance lending, the world&#13;
community would clearly profit from Bank/Fund cooperation. Guidelines for&#13;
such cooperation should be established as a matter of urgency. There is an&#13;
important problem concealed here. If the Bank moves out of its traditional&#13;
role of project lending into structural assistance lending, the question is&#13;
bound to arise regarding the conditionality that should be attached to such&#13;
lending; whether it should be additional to Fund conditionality and whether&#13;
the conditionality should be more or less soft than Fund conditionality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
An overview of Fund/Bank activities does make it clear, however,&#13;
that no substantial changes can be made in the working of the world capital&#13;
market without an increase in the resources of these institutions and some&#13;
changes in their functioning. Some people believe that these changes&#13;
are best achieved by setting up new institutions. The issues involved in&#13;
greater public activity in the world capital market are briefly discussed&#13;
below under separate headings.&#13;
Nature of Public Intervention&#13;
There are two important underlying questions concerning the nature&#13;
of international public intervention: (a) whether public intervention should&#13;
operate indirectly through private market institutions or whether it should&#13;
operate directly through public institutions; and (b) in either case, what the&#13;
intervention should seek to achieve. Consider (b) first, assuming as far as&#13;
question (a) goes that intervention is to work through the private market.&#13;
The form that public intervention should take evidently depends upon the&#13;
source of the imperfection. If the distortion consists of inadequate flows of&#13;
capital due to lack of information, public intervention should clearly seek to&#13;
make more information available. If the distortion consists of inadequate&#13;
flows of capital arising from excessive private risk aversion, public interven-&#13;
tion should take the form of a subsidy to private lending, a proposal which is&#13;
politically unpromising. If the distortion arises from the adverse selection&#13;
problem, there are two possible directions in which desirable public interven-&#13;
tion could go.&#13;
One route would be to set up an international insurance agency which&#13;
would insure private sector loans to the NDCs on payment of a premium. A&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
successful operation of this kind would be able to increase lending without an&#13;
increase in interest rates because the increased cost to the lender in the&#13;
form of the insurance premium would be offset by a reduction in cost owing to&#13;
reduced risk. It is difficult, however, to believe that such an institution&#13;
could work entirely on the basis of insurance premiums; it will probably&#13;
require IC and OEC governments to make contributions, mostly callable but&#13;
partly paid-in, to set up a guarantee fund. Obviously, once the institution&#13;
gets going it could take up insurance business considerably in excess of the&#13;
guarantees. An insurance-guarantee scheme of this kind creates two different&#13;
problems. (i) The problem of "moral hazard" which consists in the availability&#13;
of guarantees inducing behavior which leads to increased incidence of the&#13;
hazard being guarded against; this problem can be met, to some extent, by&#13;
making the guarantees partial, by restricting insurance claims only to&#13;
contingencies arising out of uncontrollable events, and by making the con-&#13;
tinuation of insurance subject to certain performance criteria. (ii) The&#13;
switching problem, meaning that a guarantee scheme, which is small in&#13;
relation to existing capital flows, could simply lead to substitution of&#13;
guaranteed for unguaranteed loans without any additionality; it is doubtful&#13;
if additionality can be secured unless the guarantee fund is sizable.&#13;
A different route, which has sometimes been suggested as response&#13;
to the adverse selection problem, is to impose severe penalties on governments&#13;
which default, in the form of exclusion from future borrowing or economic&#13;
retaliation of other varieties. 1/ The object of the penalties is to reduce&#13;

the incentive to default, to mitigate the "dishonest borrower problem," and&#13;
thereby to increase private capital flows. This proposal envisages inter-&#13;
national public institutions operating a monitoring and penalty-imposing&#13;
machine. Apart from the political problems that such a proposal would involve,&#13;
it is not even clear that the proposal in its crude form is economically&#13;
efficient. Imposing penalties cannot have a positive effect when defaults are&#13;
caused by uncontrollable events.&#13;
The last distortion of the world capital market which we shall&#13;
consider is its insufficient flexibility in dealing with inflation and the&#13;
cash flow problem which it imposes on borrowers. The solution to this problem&#13;
could lie in financial innovation through the introduction of indexed bonds. 1/&#13;
It is not clear how such an introduction can be achieved without international&#13;
public institutions taking an active role. This proposal is discussed further&#13;
below.&#13;
Turning to question (a), the foregoing discussion makes clear that&#13;
public intervention has to take the form of a judicious mixture of financial&#13;
provision, financial innovation, setting of performance criteria, and monitor-&#13;
ing of economic performance. The presumption must be that these tasks are&#13;
sometimes more efficiently performed by public institutions directly than by&#13;
indirect support to private institutions. Hence, expansion of public lending&#13;
is desirable along with the growth of private lending. This provides the&#13;
rationale for the existence and extension of the Fund and the World Bank's&#13;
activities, as already discussed. Some people have argued that a new&#13;
international public institution should be set up, and we now discuss this&#13;
issue.&#13;

New versus Old Intermediaries&#13;
Whether the increased recycling should be carried out by a new&#13;
public institution is a source of controversy. Certainly, one of the simplest&#13;
ways to achieve increased recycling would be through traditional institutions,&#13;
say, by increasing IMF quotas and IBRD capital. If, in addition, the IMF&#13;
entered the market directly and the World Bank were to change its gearing&#13;
ratio, quite sizable funds would be unlocked. If the political will were&#13;
present, these changes could be achieved fairly swiftly, probably faster than&#13;
getting a new institution off the ground. Moreover, there are arguably&#13;
significant economies in extending the present institutions rather than&#13;
setting up new ones, in view of the fact that the existing institutions have&#13;
already built up a stock of relevant expertise.&#13;
The case against the traditional institutions is that (a) they&#13;
might be stuck in old grooves--the IMF in short-term lending and the World Bank&#13;
in project lending--from which they would find it difficult to escape; and&#13;
(b) they have a decision-making structure which is heavily weighted in favor&#13;
of the ICs. Taking (a) first, it must be noted that there have recently been&#13;
several new initiatives in the Fund and the Bank which show a willingness to&#13;
be flexible: the Fund in the direction of giving longer-term loans with less&#13;
rigid conditionality and the Bank in the direction of giving program loans.&#13;
Perhaps the complaint has fundamentally to do with the conditionality provisions.&#13;
But even in a new institution, the creditors would be unlikely to put up any&#13;
money if the conditionality were too soft. Certainly, it seems unrealistic to&#13;
expect that creditors would be willing to lend large sums to the NDCs at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
equivalent of IMF first credit-tranche conditionality. Turning to (b), it is&#13;
certainly possible to imagine a new institution with a different voting&#13;
structure, along the lines, for example, of the International Fund for&#13;
Agricultural Development, in which voting power is equally divided between IC,&#13;
OEC, and NDC governments but decisions on some issues require bigger&#13;
majorities than on other issues. The question is, what are the chances of IC&#13;
governments' being willing to contribute to a new institution with substantial&#13;
capital and a "radical" voting structure, if the presumption is that it is in&#13;
business to make loans to the NDCs with soft conditionality? The chances of&#13;
getting such an institution off the ground really depend on whether the OECs&#13;
are willing to put up most of the money. There may perhaps be greater likeli-&#13;
hood of persuading the IC governments to contribute to setting up an affiliate&#13;
of the Bank or the Fund with a modified voting structure. Relevant possibil-&#13;
ities include the Bank's proposed "energy affiliate" and what has been termed&#13;
the "Bank's Bank" which would operate much along the lines of a commercial&#13;
bank.&#13;
Terms of Borrowing and Lending&#13;
One of the important issues is whether to offer indexed bonds&#13;
to ultimate lenders. Proponents of indexation believe that such a move would&#13;
increase loan maturities and reduce borrowers' cash flow problems. Moreover,&#13;
it is claimed, unless OECs are offered indexed assets, they may choose to&#13;
leave more oil in the ground, which would affect both the ICs and the NDCs&#13;
adversely. Of course, OECs have had this option all along, but, it can be&#13;
argued, inflationary expectations have now caught up with reality. Offering&#13;
OEC lenders indexed assets may make sense in exchange for an agreement that&#13;
the real price of oil would rise very moderately and predictably; otherwise,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
it plainly would not make sense. Even if full indexation is considered to be&#13;
too radical, there is a case for going at least part of the way by offering&#13;
assets which offer some protection against exchange risk. The IMF, for&#13;
example, is intending to borrow on the basis of SDR-denominated assets.&#13;
As discussed above, another issue which any intermediary, old or&#13;
new, seeking to increase lending to the NDCs would have to face is the&#13;
conditionality that should be attached to the loans. The intermediary's&#13;
borrowing capacity does depend on the confidence that ultimate lenders feel in&#13;
the security of their loans. Neither the governments putting up the guarantees&#13;
nor market institutions buying the intermediary's liabilities are likely to&#13;
feel such confidence unless they are convinced that there is some monitoring&#13;
of the adjustment efforts of the ultimate borrowers.&#13;
A quite separate way of attracting ultimate lenders would be to&#13;
offer them higher-risk but also higher-return assets; that is, by equity&#13;
features in the assets they are offered. This idea does not look terribly&#13;
promising. To begin with, recent events have cast doubt on the idea that&#13;
equities keep pace with inflation    Moreover, the OECs are not likely to&#13;
be attracted by the political implications of being involved in equity&#13;
investments. There may possibly be some mileage in bilateral deals between&#13;
individual NDC and OEC countries on this basis, but the political and&#13;
administrative complications involved in setting up an "international&#13;
investment trust" seem far too great. In any case, such an enterprise could&#13;
not get off the ground without a guarantee fund, and contributions to such a&#13;
fund seem extremely unlikely.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
V. Conclusion&#13;
Contributions toward paid-in and callable capital for the multi-&#13;
lateral lending institutions have to come largely from IC and OEC governments.&#13;
But there is some hope that borrowing in the market could tap sources which&#13;
have so far not been involved. For example, insurance companies have long-&#13;
term liabilities and might be interested in long-term assets if the return is&#13;
secure. A wider spread of ultimate borrowers would also be desirable. It&#13;
would probably be difficult to achieve this without conditionality provisions&#13;
which lenders regard as satisfactory.&#13;
Over the next five years, the crucial determinant of NDC growth&#13;
will be IC growth. If the ICs stagnate, it will be difficult to avoid a&#13;
slowing down of NDC growth. But the harshness of this effect can be mitigated&#13;
by active steps to promote recycling of funds through international public&#13;
institutions. In a deflationary atmosphere, the imperfections of the world&#13;
capital market would be exacerbated, and left to itself, it is likely to&#13;
perform below tolerable levels of efficiency.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This paper is addressed to the
            adjustment problems facing the world economy in the next
            decade, with particular reference to the situation and
            prospects of the non-oil developing countries (NDCs). The
            NDCs grew faster that the industrial countries (ICs) during
            the 1950s and 1960s in aggregate GNP, though not in GNP per
            head. More strikingly, the NDCs maintained their growth
            rates in the 1970s (albeit at the cost of higher inflation),
            whereas the performance of the ICs deteriorated markedly on
            all fronts. In the ICs, growth rates of GNP declined by more
            than a third, unemployment nearly doubled, and inflation
            more than trebled. Over the next five years, the crucial
            determinant of NDC growth will be IC growth. If the ICs
            stagnate, it will be difficult to avoid a slowing down of
            NDC growth. But the harshness of this effect can be
            mitigated by active steps to promote recycling of funds
            through international public institutions. In a deflationary
            atmosphere, the imperfections of the capital market would be
            exacerbated, and left to itself the market is likely to
            perform below tolerable levels of efficiency.
