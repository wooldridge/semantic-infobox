Development of Competitive Natural Gas&#13;
Markets in the United States&#13;
AndrejJufris     The United States enjoys a highly competitive natural gas market and an increasingly efficient&#13;
market for pipeline transportation. Consumers have benefited from changes to both the structure&#13;
and regulation of the industry in the past ten to fifteen years. These changes have lowered natural&#13;
gas prices and broadened the range of services offered by gas companies. This Note reviews the&#13;
forces driving the regulatory changes and the effects of the changes on the functioning of gas&#13;
markets. It also provides an overview of natural gas trading mechanisms in the United States. The&#13;
focus is primarily on the wholesale natural gas market, the market most affected by deregulation.&#13;

            Development of competitive natural gas
            markets in the United States
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The United States has the world's
            largest natural gas market. Fifteen years of deregulation
            have delivered significant gains to consumers in the form of
            lower prices and more services. The experience shows that
            liberalizing wholesale gas prices and the bulk supply of
            natural gas frees market forces in segments where
            competition is feasible. But regulators must focus on
            improving the regulation of pipeline transportation and
            minimizing its distortive effect on competitive gas markets.
            Introducing flexibility into pricing and other conditions of
            transportaion contracts such as delivery locations or the
            balancing of gas shipments and standardizing pipeline
            operations promote more efficient use of pipelines and
            benefit all industry participants. The U.S. experience also
            shows the important role of gas marketers and spot markets
            in increasing the efficiency of gas transactions and prices.
            Deregulation of the U.S. gas industry is far from complete,
            however. The most important task, and the biggest challenge
            for regulators, remains the deregulation of retail gas
            markets in individual states.
