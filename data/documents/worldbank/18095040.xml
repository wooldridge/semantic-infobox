regulations affecting the business of agriculture in countries around the world.&#13;
(b) The Agribusiness Deep Dives will support the development of indicators to examine a broader range of&#13;
factors affecting agricultural productivity, market access, and the policy environment for agriculture. The&#13;
deep dives will enrich the Doing Business in Agriculture indicators and help interpret them.&#13;

indicators; building data collection network; tracking the number of regulations reforms which are&#13;
directly influenced and inspired by the indicators; and preparing reports on the six key areas of&#13;
analysis mentioned above.&#13;
(c)    Analysis and assessment to develop outcome measures: Conduct analysis and assessment for the&#13;
design and implementation of outcome indicators and measures in the area of agribusiness, to&#13;
complement the Doing Business in Agriculture and the Deep Dives methodological approaches.&#13;

3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be&#13;

including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to&#13;

finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the&#13;
