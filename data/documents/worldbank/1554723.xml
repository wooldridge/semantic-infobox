ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper compares China's transport indicators with those of&#13;
other countries and attempts to define prospects for the future&#13;
development of transport in China. The share of transport in the&#13;
economy is briefly discussed, followed in Chapter II by an analysis of&#13;
the factors contributing to the high freight-transport intensity that&#13;
characterizes China's transport sector. These factors are country size&#13;
and resource location; the structure of the economy and, in particular,&#13;
the small role of the service sector in China; the degree of processing&#13;
of raw materials; and the administrative structure and vertical&#13;
integration of industry which often results in circuitous routings and&#13;
excessive transport. The chapter concludes with a discussion of average&#13;
transport distance and modal split.&#13;
In contrast to freight, passenger traffic volumes are low, as&#13;
is personal mobility, in comparison with other countries in the same&#13;
income range (Chapter III). This is also partly because capital invest-&#13;
ments in the transport sector have been small, with priority given to&#13;
freight movement. Investment levels are discussed in Chapter IV,&#13;
together with their productivity. The low share of total energy&#13;
consumed in the transport sector in China in comparison with other&#13;
countries is discussed in Chapter V, as is the fuel consumption of rail-&#13;
ways and road vehicles. The final chapter draws conclusions from the&#13;
foregoing analyses and identifies some of the principal issues in the&#13;
sector that China will face to the end of the century.&#13;

EXTRACTO&#13;
En el presente documento se comparan los indicadores del transporte&#13;
en China con los de otros paises y se intenta definir las perspectivas&#13;
existentes para el futuro desarrollo del sector en el pais. Se hace un&#13;
breve examen de la participaci6n del transporte en la economia, seguido,&#13;
en el Capitulo II, de un analisis de los factores que contribuyen a la&#13;
gran intensidad del transporte de carga que caracteriza al sector en ese&#13;
pais. Esos factores son las dimensiones del pais y la ubicaci6n de los&#13;
recursos; la estructura de la economia y, en particular, la pequeiia fun-&#13;
ci6n que desempenia el sector de servicios en China; el grado de elabora-&#13;
ci6n de las materias primas y, por ultimo, la estructura administrativa y&#13;
la integraci6n vertical de la industria, que a menudo se traducen en&#13;
itinerarios sinuosos y un transporte excesivo. El capitulo concluye con&#13;
un examen de la distancia media de transporte y de la distribuci6n modal.&#13;
En contraste con el trAfico de carga, el volumen de transporte de&#13;
pasajeros es bajo, lo mismo que la movilidad personal, en comparaci6n con&#13;
otros paises de la misma escala de ingresos (Capitulo III). Esto se debe&#13;
tambien en parte a que las inversiones de capital en el sector del trans-&#13;
porte han sido pequenias y a que se asigna prioridad al movimiento de&#13;
carga. Los niveles y la productividad de las inversiones se analizan en&#13;
el Capitulo IV. La pequeiia proporci6n del consumo total de energia&#13;
correspondiente al sector del transporte en China, en comparaci6n con&#13;
otros paises, asi como el consumo de combustible del ferrocarril y de los&#13;
vehiculos de carretera, se examinan en el Capitulo V. En el capitulo&#13;
final se extraen conclusiones de los analisis precedentes y se identifican&#13;
algunos de los principales problemas del sector que debera enfrentar China&#13;
hacia fines del siglo.&#13;

TRANSPORT IN CHINA: A COMPARISON OF BASIC INDICATORS&#13;
WITH THOSE OF OTHER COUNTRIES&#13;
i.        This paper compares China's transport indicators with those of other&#13;
countries and attempts to draw prospects for future development of transport&#13;
in China.  The first chapter deals with the share of transport in the economy,&#13;
chapters 2 and 3 cover in more details freight and passenger transport, their&#13;
growth over time and in relation to GNP, their intensity, average distance and&#13;
modal split. The fourth chapter deals with investments, and the fifth with&#13;
energy consumption in the sector; and the sixth highlights some of the major&#13;
issues that China faces in transport.&#13;
ii.       International comparisons of transport indicators are difficult&#13;
since transport is very much country specific. The size and shape of the&#13;
country, the extent of its coast line, the navigability of its lakes and&#13;
rivers, the location of natural resources and population, the nature and com-&#13;
position of the economy all affect transport, particularly the movement of&#13;
freight. Therefore, we have limited our systematic analysis to large coun-&#13;
tries, namely USA, USSR, India, Brazil and Japan, with occasional reference to&#13;
other countries on particular topics.&#13;
1. TRANSPORT IN THE ECONOMY&#13;
1.01      The share of transport in the net material product of China (NMP)&#13;
has been stable around 4% since 1952. This share in gross domestic product&#13;
(GDP) in 1981 is estimated to have been no more than 4.1% even with adjustment&#13;
of distorted prices. This is lower than the share in other countries used in&#13;
our comparison:&#13;
TRANSPORT AS PERCENTAGE OF GDP&#13;
1950-60             1960-70          1970-77&#13;
India       4.9                 5.0                 5.3&#13;
Korea       4.1                 5.9                 6.5&#13;
Brazil      6.0                 5.6                 5.2&#13;
USA          6.6                6.4                 6.4&#13;
Japan       8.1                 7.4                 6.3&#13;
Source:   World Tables, The Second Edition (1980), World Bank 1980.&#13;
From the above table it appears that the transport share of GDP increases in&#13;
countries at low levels of income (India, Korea) and decreases when income&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
exceeds a certain level (Brazil, Japan, USA)O It is surprising that the share&#13;
of transport in NMP has remained constant in China since transport has been&#13;
growing faster than NMP (Chart 1). From 1952 to 1981, NMP at constant prices&#13;
increased over five times while freight tonnage increased over seven times and&#13;
freight ton km over 11 times. Passenger traffic also increased more than 10&#13;
times. This would indicate that transport costs have decreased in relation to&#13;
other costs, which may be explained by the high intensity with which the net-&#13;
work and the rolling stock is used (see para. 4.02).&#13;
102      China's transport sector is characterized by a high freight&#13;
intensity, higher than any country except in the USSR; but a low passenger&#13;
intensity comparatively to other countries again except the USSR. The table&#13;
below relates freight and passenger traffic to GNP in 1980-81 for the various&#13;
countries of our sample:&#13;

The apparent contradiction between the high freight transport intensity of the&#13;
Chinese economy and the low contribution of transport to GDP can be explained&#13;
by the dominance of rail transport in China (see para. 2.16). Rail transport&#13;
is much less labor intensive than road transport and therefore has a much&#13;
lower value added per ton km thar. road transport. In China road freight is&#13;
seven times more labor intensive than rail while the value added is about&#13;
three times that of rail0 In the US road is about five times more labor&#13;
intensive0 The two following chapters analyze in more detail freight and&#13;
passenger transport in China and other countries of our sample0&#13;

2.03      As expected freight elasticity is generally higher in the earlier&#13;
stages of development; from 1960 to 19819 both Brazil and Korea had elasti-&#13;
cities over 1, while the USA and Japan were below 1 (Chart 3). The table&#13;
below shows freight elasticities relative to GNP in various countries. The&#13;
very high elasticity for the USSR reflects the emphasis placed on development&#13;
of resources in the far east greatly increasing average transport distances9&#13;
at a time of slower overall econcmic growLh0&#13;

gives the following equation: log of Freight Transport = -0.45 + 1.085&#13;
log of GNP (r square = 0.795) see chart 3. Further details are given&#13;
in Annex Table 2.1 together with analyses of sub-periods within the 20&#13;
year spans.&#13;
2.04      It is very difficult to predict freight elasticities for China in&#13;
the future as there are a number of factors acting in opposite directions.&#13;
The attempt to deemphasize heavy industry combined with the campaign for&#13;
industrial energy savings would point toward lower freight elasticity. On the&#13;
other hand9 the rationalization of industry which may mean larger plants in&#13;
some sectors and less regional self-sufficiency would lead to higher freight&#13;
elasticities.&#13;
Freight Intensity&#13;
2.05      China's economy appears at first sight highly intensive in freight&#13;
transport0 Expressed in ton-km of freight per dollar of GNP9it is almost&#13;
twice as intensive as the USA9 India and Brazil and eight times as intensive&#13;
as Japan and Korea both smaller size countries0 High transport intensity&#13;
seems to be a systemic characteristic of most socialist economies; the intens-&#13;
ity in the USSR being about 40% higher than that of China0 There are a number&#13;
of factors affecting transport intensity:    country size9 location of resources&#13;
and population9 composition of GNP9 the level of processing of raw materials&#13;
such as ores9 lumber9 agricultural products9 and the degree of vertical inte-&#13;
gration of industry0 The effect of each factor is discussed below on the&#13;
basis of the international comparison0 An analysis of provincial transport&#13;
intensity in China is also added at the end of this sectiono&#13;

2.06       Country Size and Resource Location. Country size is an obvious&#13;
factor affecting transport intensity measured in ton-km. This can be illu-&#13;
strated by comparing freight transport in Japan versus that in the USA for&#13;
1980.&#13;

While Japan moves a higher tonnage than the USA9 the average distance is less&#13;
than one-tenth9 reflecting not only the size of the country but the concen-&#13;
tration of its population along a limited portion of the eastern seaboard.&#13;
Size and resource location are certainly factors in the high intensity of&#13;
Soviet transport0 While average distance for total Soviet freight transport&#13;
is not available9 the average distance for rail freight has increased from 800&#13;
km in 1965 to some 925 km in 1980; reflecting the need to exploit more distant&#13;
resources in Siberia and further east particularly for coal9 ores and timbero&#13;
2.07      The implications for China are again somewhat balanced0     Chile the&#13;
country is as large as the USA9 the population is far more concentrated. Over&#13;
70% of the population lives east of a Beijing-Guangzhou line9 while in the USA&#13;
both the east and west coasts are highly developed0 For China9 this would&#13;
imply generally moderate transport distances within its densely populated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
areas, with a smaller proportion of freight moving to and from the distant&#13;
western parts of the country. Regarding resources, the most common, such as&#13;
coal, are spread throughout the country. However, the conditions for coal&#13;
exploitation in the Shanxi-Nei Monggol area are more favorable than in the&#13;
Northeast and Southwest. Concentrating on these resources will increase&#13;
transport intensity more than would the development of local production closer&#13;
to demand areas or the development of industry close to primary resources.&#13;
The trade-offs are between higher mining costs and lower transport costs of&#13;
regional mines. The same applies to feed grains and meat production. The&#13;
former are produced more efficiently in the north-east, the latter is produced&#13;
more intensively in the south. The trade-offs are between shipping grain from&#13;
north to south versus shifting some of the meat production to the north.&#13;
2.08      Composition of CNP.    This is probably the major factor affecting&#13;
transport intensity. Heavy industry is more transport intensive than light&#13;
industry which in turn is more intensive than services. Therefore it should&#13;
be expected that, all other things being equal as an economy diversifies,&#13;
transport intensity decreases. Such a decrease is very noticeable in Japan&#13;
where freight intensity decreased from 0.62 tkm/$CNP in 1960 to 0.41 in 1980&#13;
while the service sector increased from 42% to 53% of GNP. The case is some-&#13;
what less clear in the US where a long-term decrease from 1.91 in 1960 to 1.69&#13;
in 1977 was somewhat reversed in 1981 (1.81). This can be explained by the&#13;
very small changes which occurred in the sectoral composition of the US econ-&#13;
omy between 1960 and 1980. The table below gives the broad sectoral dis-&#13;
tribution of CDP in the countries of our sample.&#13;

China has the smallest service sector and the largest industrial sector among&#13;
the above countries. This is certainly a major factor in explaining the high&#13;
freight intensity. Assuming that the service sector does not generate any&#13;
freight transport, the freight intensity related to total GNP of a country&#13;
where the service sector is 20% (China) would be double that of a country&#13;
where the service sector is 60% (USA) with the same intensity of freight for&#13;
the other sectors (agriculture and industry). The freight intensity of China&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

is thus smaller than that of the USA when the service sector is excluded, but&#13;
still higher than that of India. The following table shows freight intensity&#13;
related to the non-service sectors of the economy.&#13;

2.09       Processing of Raw Materials. Any weight reducing processing done at&#13;
the source of raw materials will reduce transport intensity. Coal being&#13;
transported in such massive quantities in China is a prime candidate for pre-&#13;
transport treatment. The following international comparison speaks for&#13;
itself.&#13;

In the case of the USSR9 it is said that further coal preparation would save&#13;
20-25 million tons of transport per year; (out of a total moved by rail of&#13;
over 700 million tons) and that ex essive humidity and rock content mobilize&#13;
2009000 extra rail cars per year.- In China a reduction in the volume of&#13;
coal transported by rail of 5 to 10% would save transporting 20-40 million&#13;
tons.&#13;

2.10      Other examples from the USSR I/ indicate that, every year, 11 mil-&#13;
lion tons of fertilizer are transported which contain only half the normal&#13;
nutrient level. Also, because scrap steel is not well pressed and packed, it&#13;
is estimated that 250,000 extra rail cars are needed to move the total volume&#13;
of 58 million tons. Regarding timber transport, it is estimated that raw logs&#13;
require 35-40% more rolling stock than would sawn timber. By contrast, the&#13;
table below indicates that in the US large tonnages of primary forest and wood&#13;
raw materials move only a very short distance (93 km) while smaller quantities&#13;
of sawmill products and plywood move on distances which, for rail transport,&#13;
are comparable to those in China and the USSR for timber (which includes both&#13;
logs and sawn timber). This indicates that in the US processing generally&#13;
occurs near the production sites. From the US figures above, it can also be&#13;
seen that the share of rail increases as the average transport distance for&#13;
the product becomes longer (Modal split is discussed in more detail below).&#13;

2.11      The 1982 Almanac of China's economy mentions iron ore and phosphate&#13;
rock where dressing could save transport. However, since detailed information&#13;
on raw material processing for products other than coal is lacking, it is not&#13;
possible to estimate how much total transport demand could be reduced in China&#13;
by processing and preparing before transport. It is probably safe to say,&#13;
however, that savings could be substantial.&#13;

2.12      Vertical Integration of Industry. It is not clear to what extent&#13;
this factor affects transport intensity in China9 as the general impression is&#13;
that industries tend to be more integrated than in other countries i.e. manu-&#13;
facture all components in-house. If that is true9 further rationalization of&#13;
production may imply more transport per unit of output. For instance9 if a&#13;
refrigerator factory decides to buy its compressors rather than make them9&#13;
transport will increase. However this may be more economical if the refriger-&#13;
ator factory would otherwise make compressors in uneconomic quantities. In&#13;
the USSR, it appears that fragmentation in certain industries i-7 leading to&#13;
excess transport of parts and unfinished heavy steel products5.     Also the&#13;
vertical integration within Ministries results in purchases of components&#13;
without regard for transport distances9 i.e., ignoring a source for the&#13;
product which may be nearer but under a different Ministry. '"'or example, the&#13;
rolled steel needed by the Chongqing Post and Telecommunications Equipment&#13;
Factory is supplied by the Chongqing No0 3 Iron and Steel Plant0 Although the&#13;
warehouses of the two are only four kilometres apart, steel products, under&#13;
the old system, had to be transported to a warehouse several hundred kilo'&#13;
metres away, then distributed to the Post and Telecommunications Equipment&#13;
Factory after management fees were collected by the administrative department&#13;
in charge0 As a result, steel products which cost 700 yuan per ton finally&#13;
cost 900 yuan per ton after 3ravelling more than 500 kilometres on the&#13;
Chengdu-Chongqing Railway0"- Reform of this "old system" has started as&#13;
enterprises formerly under the administration of 22 ministries and Sichuan&#13;
Province are now under the management of the city of Chongqing, but surely&#13;
similar problems still exist in other parts of China0&#13;
2o13      China:   Freight Intensity by Province0   Freight intensity measured&#13;

pg0 71). While the data on tkm by province include all modes, the road and&#13;
water transport totals allocated to the provinces amount to only one-third&#13;
their national totals reported in global figures0 For roads, provincial fig-&#13;
ures cover only the transport bureaus under MOC; for waterways, it is not&#13;
clear what is covered, but the provincial distribution probably excludes&#13;
coastal shipping0 If all water and road transport were recorded by province,&#13;
the transport intensity of provinces in the Yangtze river basin would cer-&#13;
tainly increase and Jiangxi and Hubei could exceed the national average also0&#13;
2.14      Most provinces with a transport intensity above the national average&#13;
also have above average rail network density, both in terms of population and&#13;
area0  The same provinces also tend to have a higher proporticn of heavy&#13;
industry than provinces with lower transport intensityo The table below shows&#13;

their rail density and the share of heavy and light industry. Only in&#13;
Shaanxi, Henan, Anhui and Guangxi is the share of heavy industry lower than&#13;
average while transport intensity is higher. This can easily be explained for&#13;
Henan by its location at the intersection of two very important rail lines;&#13;
the north-south Beijing - Guangzhou and the east-west Longhai ines0 The same&#13;
explanation, although to a lesser extent also applies to Shaanzi, Anhui and&#13;
Guangxi, where transit traffic is probably higher than averagec A regression&#13;
analysis shows that there is a significant relationship between transport&#13;
intensity in tkm/Yuan of CVIAO and the share of heavy industrial output in a&#13;
province. The equation is Y = -0.335 + 2.544 x in which Y is tkm/Yuan of&#13;
GVIAO and x is the heavy industry output share in percent of total industrial&#13;
output (GVIO). Details are shown in Annex Table 2039 po2.&#13;
Average Transport Distance and Modal Split&#13;
2.15       Some references to transport distances were made in the section&#13;
above about transport intensity0 Annex Table 2.4 gives average freight dis-&#13;
tances for China, USA and Japan, the only countries for which information is&#13;
available0 For other countries, average distances are only available for rail&#13;
freight0 In China, average transport distance increased substantially from&#13;
159 km in 1949 to 382 km in 1982. The increase has not been gradual but in&#13;
brief spurts followed by many years without change0 As the economy recovered&#13;
from the war, it increased rapidly to 249 km in 1951 and then remained around&#13;
this level until 1962. A new surge occurred and the average reached 282 km in&#13;
1965, stagnating at this new level until 1976, probably as a result of the&#13;
policy of increased regional self-sufficency0 From then, it has been increas-&#13;
ing very rapidly, adding 30% in 5 years0 The present average transport dist-&#13;
ance in China is still much lower than that of the US, a country of equal&#13;
size0 The location of population and resources are probably the main factor&#13;
explaining this fact (para. 2.07). Average transport distance may thus well&#13;
continue to increase in China with rationalization of industrial production&#13;
and greater reliance on specialization of areas endowed with specific producc-&#13;
tion advantages (coal in the north, feed grains in the northeast)0&#13;
2.16      The dominance of rail in the sector is unique to China0     Despite a&#13;
reduction in share from over 80% in 1950 to 66% in 1982, rail in China still&#13;
has the largest share of freight traffic of any country in the world0 Con-&#13;
versely, the use of road transport in China is among the lowest in the&#13;
world0 The only country with a lower road share is the USSR mainly because of&#13;
the very large share handled by pipelines (32%).&#13;

/a   The road figure for China includes 760 million tons handled by the&#13;
Highway Transport Departments and 3,095 million tons by own account&#13;
trucks, according to surveys conducted by MOC.&#13;
The above statistics may not be entirely comparable in coverage. Some deal&#13;
with intercity traffic only (Korea, USA), others like Japan probably include&#13;
trips within urban areas.   In the case of Japan, almost 30% of the road tonn-&#13;
age consists of sand, gravel and stone moving an average distance of 16 km&#13;
only. The figure for the USA covers only industrial products and thus fall&#13;
far short of the total road transport which include large quantities of pri-&#13;
mary materials moving over short distances. The figures above confirm that&#13;
modern road transport in China is still very small. However, the total&#13;
tonnage moved on roads is probably much higher when one considers all the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

traditional modes including all the agricultural tractors which represent most&#13;
of the traffic on many roads in China.&#13;
2.18      The burden placed on the Chinese railway by short distance traffic&#13;
is well known. Hauls shorter than 100 km account for 23% of total rail&#13;
freight traffic and amounted to 250 million tons in 1980; hauls shorter than&#13;
50 km accounted for 14% of rail traffic. The same problem appears to affect&#13;
the USSR with its railway transporting 380 million tons (13%) within less than&#13;
50 km and 700 million tons (24% of total) within less than 100 km. In India,&#13;
however9 tonnage moved less than 100 km accounts for only 6% of total rail&#13;
traffic while 50% of the traffic moves over 700 km0 In China much of the&#13;
short haul rail traffic happens in and around large metropolitan areas such as&#13;
Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Taiyuan etc0 For instance, 49% of the 30 million&#13;
tons loaded in the Beijing urban area are moving over distances less than&#13;
50 km0 Percentages are 33% and 25% respectively for Tianjin and Taiyuan.&#13;
Major commodities in this metropolitan rail transport are construction&#13;
materials, coal, ores, oil and steel generally moving from sidings to sidings&#13;
(Annex Table 2.5). On a sample of main lines, short haul trafLfic ranges only&#13;
from 0.5% to 11% of total traffic, except for some short movements of ore and&#13;
coal between a mine and a plant on two of the lines (Annex Table 2.6). There-&#13;
fore, little capacity could be saved by removing short haul traffic on trunk&#13;
lines; but the situation would need to be studied in large metropolitan areas0&#13;
2.19       In almost all countries, the rail share of traffic has decreased&#13;
markedly over the last 20-30 years (Tables 2.7 to 2.12). The most striking&#13;
case is Japan where the share of rail dropped from 51% in 1955 to 9% in&#13;
1980. The exception to this trend is Brazil which, however, does not have a&#13;
major railway infrastructure and where the share of rail increased from 19% in&#13;
1960 to 23% in l981 Most of the shift from the railways has been toward road&#13;
transport, except in USSR where pipelines account for 32% of total trans-&#13;
port0 As illustrated by the international experience, there is a large poten-&#13;
tial for the development of road transport in China0 In India, road transport&#13;
has been shown to be more economical than rail for most commodity movements up&#13;
to 200 to 250 kilometers0   For some commodities, particularly perishable&#13;
fruits and vegetables and small machinery, road transport has a comparative&#13;
advantage over rail for distances up to 450 kni0 Further details are in&#13;
para. 2.22. The average distance for road transport of industrial products in&#13;
the USA is 235 km, within the economic range indicated for India.     In comparison,&#13;
average road transport distance in China is a mere 35 km; up from 10 km in the&#13;
1950s. The average is apparently only 18 km in the USSRo Increasing the&#13;
share of road transport in China will face a number of problems, i.e., the&#13;
need for major development efforts on the road network; the production of&#13;
vehicles, particularly fuel efficient ones; and the demand for liquid fuel,&#13;
which could easily increase five times over the next 15-20 years0&#13;
2.20       In Japan, the shift from rail has not only brought traffic to roads&#13;
but also to coastal shipping which has replaced rail as the dominant mode and&#13;
accounts now for 51% of the traffic (the share of rail in 1955). In 1980,&#13;
coastal shipping in Japan moved 450 million tons over an average distance of&#13;
470 km (Annex Table 2.13). In comparison, the two transport bureaus under the&#13;
Ministry of Communication in China moved only 50 million tons in 1979 albeit&#13;
over distances exceeding 1,000 km0 The figure may somewhat understate the&#13;

total amount of coastal shipping as some will be done by agencies not under&#13;
central authority. Nevertheless, there seems to be scope for further increas-&#13;
ing coastal shipping in China. The distances for coastal shipping are very&#13;
comparable for the two countries. The distance between the new industrial&#13;
port of Tomakomai in Hokkaido to Nagasaki in Kyushu is equivalent to that&#13;
between Qingdao and Guangzhou (see Map 1). In Japan, five commodities account&#13;
for some 80% of the coastal shipping traffic:&#13;

Traffic for these five commodities increased almost three times in 15 years or&#13;
at an average annual rate of 7% p.a. In the case of China, coal, petroleum&#13;
products and grain are very good candidates for increased transport by coastal&#13;
shipping.&#13;
2.21       Modal split varies greatly from commodity to commodity.      Typically,&#13;
bulk commodities are more economically carried by either rail or water trans-&#13;
port than by road, even over short distances. Indeed, in most countries&#13;
including China about three quarters of all rail traffic is made up by at most&#13;
10 commodities. As shown in Tables 2.14 to 2.18 these commodities are the&#13;
same for all countries and their ranking is fairly stable. They consist of&#13;
coal, petroleum, ores, timber, iron and steel, cement, construction materials,&#13;
grain and fertilizer.&#13;
2.22       Modal split by commodity requires special studies and surveys which&#13;
are not readily available in many countries. A survey conducted in India for&#13;
interregional freight traffic, dividing India into 289 regions, shows the&#13;
following modal split for various commodities in 1978-79.&#13;

cement and fertilizer distribution in the U.S. Cement is distributed over&#13;
rather short distances. Because of the ubiquity of the basic raw material,&#13;
the industry locates near markets and, therefore, the most common transport&#13;
mode is road (83% of the total). For fertilizer, the average distribution&#13;
distance is almost three times that for cement. As a result, much larger&#13;
proportions of the product go by rail and water than for cement.&#13;

2.24      By comparison9 the average transport distance of cement by rail in&#13;
China is 422 km in 19839 substantially higher than in the US despite the fact&#13;
that a higher percentage of the production moves by rail in China (30% versus&#13;
9% in the U.S.). This long distance is somewhat puzzling since plant size in&#13;
China is smaller than in the US and indeed much of the production occurs in&#13;
very small plants. One possible explanation is that there may be cross hauls&#13;
of cement as a result of certain administrative organization. For the USSR9&#13;
the data is only available for construction materials as a whole9 including&#13;
cement. The average rail transport distance is a very high 480 km. A com-&#13;
parable average for China9 adding cement and construction materials9 would be&#13;
only 245 km. Construction materials consisting of sand9 gravel and bricks&#13;
would generally be expected to move only on very short distances9 and primar-&#13;
ily by road. In Japan, sand, gravel and stone account for almost 30% of the&#13;
tonnage transported by road (1,492 million tons in 1980), but move on average&#13;
only 16 km (Annex Table 2.20).&#13;
2.25       For fertilizer9 the average rail distance in China9 731 km, is very&#13;
comparable to that in the USA (737 km) and both are considerably lower than&#13;
that in the USSR (1,079 km) and India (1,015 km). Here, the location of the&#13;
plants and their average size have a major impact on a particular country's&#13;
transport pattern. The average distance in China increased rapidly from&#13;
550 km in 1978 to over 700 km in 1982 following the opening of 13 large&#13;
fertilizer plants. Distribution studies for specific commodities have been&#13;
done in many countries,   Coal, cement, fertilizer, and grain would all be&#13;
potential candidates for similar studies in China in view of their dominance&#13;
in the transport system.&#13;
Port Traffic&#13;
2.26      Port traffic in China is still low, mainly as a result of the self-&#13;
sufficiency policy and the littLe development of coastal shipping mentioned&#13;
above. It is increasing rapidly, however, having grown almost 80% since 1976,&#13;
from 142 million tons to 250 million tons in 1983 for the centrally admin-&#13;
istered coastal ports. The Government has recognized the importance of having&#13;
adequate ports to handle the traffic generated by its change in trade policies&#13;
and major capacity investments are taking place in many ports. The present&#13;
five-year plan envisages the construction of 132 new berths by 1990. Looking&#13;
at port development in other countries, it can only be expected that further&#13;
large port investments will be needed in China over the next two decades to&#13;
keep up with expanding trade and increase the use of coastal shipping.&#13;

The most explosive growth in port traffic in recent years has been that of&#13;
Japan. Traffic increased 10 times between 1955 and 1975, from 250 million&#13;
tons (about China's present level) to 2,500 million tons. This is equivalent&#13;
to an average annual growth rate of over 12%. Over a twenty year period&#13;
between 1960 and 1980, port traffic in the U.S. more than doubled from&#13;
942 million tons to 1,950 million tons. This corresponds to an average growth&#13;
rate of 4% p.a. It is not surprising that this figure is lower than for Japan&#13;
as the US economy was already more developed in 1960 and port traffic was then&#13;
four times that of Japan. Also Japan imports most of its raw materials and&#13;
energy.&#13;
2.28       Port traffic is related in part to foreign trade, in part to the&#13;
development of coastal shipping, both of which have increased rapidly in Japan&#13;
over the last 20 years. The table below shows the relative share of foreign&#13;
trade in the GNP of selected countries.&#13;

2.29      While the figure above may be lower than other estimates9 China's&#13;
foreign trade is still low by international standards. However9 a continua-&#13;
tion of the present economic policies is likely to foster foreign trade&#13;
increase at a rate higher than that of the overall economy. Coastal shipping&#13;
may also grow faster than overall economic growth. Combined9 these two&#13;
factors will generate a growth in port traffic which may well be 50% higher&#13;
than the growth in GNP, i.e.9 between 10 and 12% p.a. This would mean that&#13;
port traffic in the year 2000 could be five times the present level. While&#13;
some rationalization may be possible to avoid some of the present transship-&#13;
ments between seaward and inland waterway traffic, this traffic demand would&#13;
still imply the need for very large port investments to avoid bottlenecks that&#13;
would stifle economic development0&#13;
30 PASSENGER TRAFFIC&#13;
Growth of Passenger Traffic&#13;
3.01       Passenger traffic reached 274 billion passenger-km (pkri) *in 19829 an&#13;
11-fold increase since 1952 and an average annual growth rate above 8%. The&#13;
growth of passenger traffic has been more erratic than that of freight0 For&#13;
instance9 the traffic levels reached in the early 1960s were not achieved&#13;
again until the early 1970s. Since 1978 however9 the growth has been very&#13;
impressive averaging 12% p.a09 well over twice the overall rate of economic&#13;
growth (Chart 49 Annex Table 3.1). This illustrates the potential demand for&#13;
travel as income grows0   It is likely that this growth would have been even&#13;
higher if it had not been constrained by the limited capacity to offer more&#13;
passenger services0&#13;

people in China is still very low; it reached 270 pkm per cap-ta in 1982&#13;

Note:  The multicountry regresslon of mobility (pkm/capita) versus income&#13;
(GNP/capita) gives the following equation. Mobility = -26.62 +- 0.865&#13;
Income (r square = 0.91) see Chart 5. (Although the best fit is for&#13;
natural numbers, the graph is in log scale for presentation&#13;
purposes.) Further details as well as time series and sources are&#13;
given in Annex Table 3.l1&#13;
The low mobility in China most likely results from demand restraint combined&#13;
with inadequate supply of passenger transport capacity0 Demand restraint is&#13;
partially a consequence of the comparatively low share of CGP going to house-&#13;
hold consumption, perhaps 50% in China as compared with some 7C% in India0&#13;
The mobility in the USSR is also low; it is just Wlow that of Brazil where&#13;
per capita income is only half that of the ussR0 -     The comparison of&#13;
mobility across economies indicates that it is generally lower in centrally&#13;
planned economies than in market economies (Chart 5).&#13;
3.03      As indicated above, personal mobility is strongly related to income&#13;
levels0 Elasticity relative to income is also higher at lower income levels&#13;
than at higher ones0 Countries at low levels of income show increasing eles-&#13;
ticities as income grows (China, India, Brazil, Korea) while higher income&#13;
countries have decreasing elasticity (USA, Japan)0 Detailed elasticity&#13;
figures derived through regression analysis are given in the Lable below for&#13;
4/   USSR statistics do not include travel by private car, which has been&#13;
estimated to add about 10% to the total pkm (Soviet Economy in the&#13;
1980's: Problems and Prospects Part 1, Joint Economic Committee Congress&#13;
of the United States, December 31, 1982).&#13;

seven countries. It shows that over the last 15-20 years9 elasticities have&#13;
been rising in India, Brazil and Korea and dropping in Japan and the U.S.&#13;
Almost everywhere9 increase in mobility has been accompanied by a strong&#13;
demand for personal transport. An inter-country comparison shows that the&#13;
income elasticity gf personal transport is substantially higher than that of&#13;
public transport0.    For the thirty four countries in the sample9 personal&#13;
transport has an income elasticity of two while rail and air transport have&#13;
elasticities of 102 and local transport of 100 There is no doubt that as&#13;
income levels increase in China9 similar pressure for personal transport will&#13;
materialize.&#13;
3.04      The implications of this analysis for China are clear; there is a&#13;
very high potential demand for personal travel as income rises. At China's&#13;
level of income9 the international comparison indicates that elasticities of&#13;
travel would also be increasing over quite an income range before they start&#13;
tapering off. Taking an income elasticity of 1059 which is well below elas-&#13;
ticities in India and Brazil and assuming a 7% growth of GNP would mean an&#13;
annual growth in mobility of 10% resulting in a mobility 5 times larger than&#13;
now by the year 2000. This wouLd mean about 19250 pkm per capita9 the level&#13;
of mobility reached in the USSR between 1960 and 1965 and in Brazil in 1970.&#13;
How much of this demand wilL be. apparent in China will depend upon Government&#13;
policies including how much the Government will be willing to invest in the&#13;
infrastructure and rolling stock which would be necessary to satisfy even such&#13;
a relatively modest demand by international standardsa&#13;

It shows that most trips were made to visit relatives followed by business&#13;
trips. Purely recreational trips amount to less than one quarter of the&#13;
total. There is no doubt that personal travel is an important ingredient in&#13;
economic activity as well as for the basic livelihood of the people. A survey&#13;
of rail passengers in the Shanghai Railway Administration indicates that 31%&#13;
of the trips are made for business.&#13;

3.07      In all countries including China9 the rail share of traffic has&#13;
decreased markedly over the last 20-30 years (Tables 3.3 to 3.8). The advent&#13;
of the private car has of course ended rail travel in the U.S., prevented its&#13;
development in Brazil9 and greatly reduced its use in Japan. In China and&#13;
India9 the role of buses has increased sharply0 The share of bus passengers&#13;
in China increased from 5% in 1950 to 35% in 19829 and from 25Z to 60% in&#13;
India in terms of passenger km0 In terms of passenger transported, buses in&#13;
China transport almost three times as many passengers as the railways. Given&#13;
the relatively low density of the railway system and the fact that most trips&#13;
are relatively short distances (average distance is 155 lkm for rail and 32 km&#13;
for road)9 the share of bus travel will continue to increase rapidly in&#13;
China. This will compound the burden placed on the road sector by freight&#13;
traffic. With increased production and income in the rural areas9 the demand&#13;
for personal travel to markets and towns will be very large and for most areas&#13;
can only be handled by bus0&#13;
3.08      Aviation is another mode where China is lagging behind other&#13;
countries0 Only 4 million passengers were carried in 19819 versus 5.3 mill;ion&#13;
in India with a much lower population, and 267.3 million in the USA0 Given&#13;
the distances in China, there is certainly a great scope for further develop-&#13;
ment of aviation.&#13;

Nevertheless, the density of the network is still very low in comparison with&#13;
that of other countries. Both in terms of density per area or population,&#13;
China falls below other countries in our sample. India, with a lower income&#13;
per capita has a transport network 2.5 times as dense as that of China per&#13;
head of population and over 5 times as dense per land area. The U.S. which&#13;
has the densest network per capita of our sample (30 times as dense as China)&#13;
also has 7 times more km of rail and road for an area the size of China.&#13;
Adding some 100,000 km of inland waterways would only marginally improve the&#13;
picture in China. Also, other large countries such as the U.S. and USSP have&#13;
even larger navigable inland water networks than China. Annex Table 4.2 gives&#13;
the rail density by province in China. Provinces in north, northeast and&#13;
northwest China generally have rail densities above national average both in&#13;
terms of population and area. Because of their low population, western pro-&#13;
vinces also have high rail densities per population but not by area. Guangxi&#13;
also exceeds both national averages. Central and southern provinces exceed&#13;
the average density per area but are below average in terms of density per&#13;
population (see also para. 2.14).&#13;

4.02      Because the transport network is still small in China9 it is used&#13;
very intensively at least for the railways. China has the second largest&#13;
freight density in the world after the USSR9 and the second highest passenger&#13;
density after India. Locomotives and rolling stock also have very high&#13;
utilization factors in comparison with other countries.&#13;

Although little statistical information is available on road tzaffic9 visual&#13;
inspection indicates that roads are also used intensively in China0 Because&#13;
of the low density of the network and therefore lack of alternative routes9&#13;
existing roads are used both by motorized and non-motorized traffic with the&#13;
result of greatly reducing the speed of motorized traffic0 The national&#13;
average speed of motorized vehicles is less than 30 km/hr and much lower in&#13;
the vicinity of cities and towns where congestion by non-motorized vehicles&#13;

and small tractors is heavy. In recent years, a number of corridors have&#13;
emerged where a modern road, reserved to motorized traffic, would be&#13;
justified. There is however one area where intensity of use appears low in&#13;
China, namely trucking. The total output of road freight transport in China&#13;
and India was about the same in 1979-80, around 77 billion tkm. In India&#13;
however, this was achieved with only 30% the number of trucks available in&#13;
China.&#13;

This low productivity results from a number of factors: (a) the predominance&#13;
of small size trucks in China; (b) the low utilization resulting from the pre-&#13;
dominance of trucks for own account use rather than for common carrier servi-&#13;
ces; (c) the high incidence of empty running; (d) the short average transport&#13;
distance by road which means that much of the truck time is used in loading/&#13;
unloading and waiting; and (e) the low average speed. Another factor affect-&#13;
ing productivity, as calculated here with regard to the entire fleet, is the&#13;
availability of trucks for service or conversely the proportion of the fleet&#13;
under maintenance or repairs. No information is available on this point;&#13;
except that this seems to have been a problem in the USSR in the 1960 , when&#13;
the average percentage of the truck fleet at work was less than 65%.6 A&#13;
comparison with developed market economies is difficult; in the USA for&#13;
instance more than half the "trucks" are used for personal transportation,&#13;
i.e., like cars. Heavy trucks (over 12 t gross weight, empty weight + max.&#13;
load) average 55,000 km p.a. Assuming an average load of 10 tons would give a&#13;
productivity of 555,000 tkm.&#13;

Investment&#13;
4.04      From 1953 to 1980, some Y 110 billion or 15.0% of all new investment&#13;
coming under the heading "State Capital Construction" went into the transport&#13;
sector (Annex Table 4.3). In comparison, transport investment constitutes&#13;
10-14% of annual domestic investments in developed economies, it is often&#13;
double these percentages in other LDCs.7/ China's share would then appear&#13;
somewhat on the low side. However, "State Capital Construction" probably&#13;
excludes some of China's fixed investments done by the lower levels of govern-&#13;
ment; it also excludes renewals which in many countries are included in&#13;
investments. In recent years, with the exception of 1981, annual investments&#13;
in the transport sector have averaged about Y 6 billion with about half that&#13;
amount going to railways, and around 20% each to ports and waterways and to&#13;
roads.&#13;
4.05      Transport investments generally account for higher proportion of&#13;
total investment in the early stages of development. An example of this is&#13;
India.&#13;

By contrast, transport investment in the USSR since 1950 has been held below&#13;
10% of total investment. A slight increase reflecting the pipeline boom has&#13;
taken place since 1976, with an average of 11.1% for 1976-79. Low transporta-&#13;
tion investment seems to be the fate of socialist economies as illustrated by&#13;
the following quote: "It thus happens that branches of infrastructure - and&#13;
among them also transport - are usually to be found at the end of the "queue"&#13;
and mostly only the remainder of investment resources is allocated to their&#13;
development and that the cutting down of investment usually begins with them&#13;
when economic management wishes to restrict the investment process. Transport&#13;
is suitable for such a "role" for several reasons. Firstly, the economic&#13;
result of its services may be measured with greater difficulty than that of&#13;

material production in general. Besides, neglect of the development of trans-&#13;
port will reach a critical level only if it accumulated over a relatively&#13;
longer period, since in the transport system capacity reserves can be usually&#13;
found - that may be exploited, for example, through reorganization, or, as it&#13;
was done in the majority of socialist countries, by the employment of addi-&#13;
tional manpower and the extraordinary extension of working time0       t may seem,&#13;
therefore, that the tolerance of transport is "almost infinite"0'.'&#13;

recent years for selected countries0 It is difficult to obtain total invest-&#13;
ment in the transport sector of developed market economies since there are so&#13;
many actors involved. To give some order of magnitude, in the USA, state&#13;
highways departments have invested some US$15 billion p.a. (roads) in recent&#13;
years; the private sector has invested some US$29 billion and private car pur-&#13;
chases run at US$75 billion0 The total of these three figures alone add up to&#13;
almost US$120 billion, about 40 times the level in China. In Japan, road&#13;
investment was over US$20 billion in 1979 and port investment has been running&#13;
at US$2 to 2.5 billion p.a. in recent years despite the fact that port traffic&#13;
is now increasing less rapidly than in the 1960s and 1970s0&#13;

to the level of India0 The percentage is about 1.4 in the USSR, goes up to&#13;
2.0 in Korea and 3.26 in Brazil. The incomplete figures given above for the&#13;
USA already add up to 4.6% of GNP, while in Japan public investment in roads&#13;
and ports alone amount to 2% of GNP. This excludes private investments and in&#13;

level of investment in the transport sector of market economies represent the&#13;
widespread use of private automobile, and in this sense the figures are not&#13;
particularly relevant for China at this stage. Nevertheless, even without&#13;
private cars, the demand for transport investment will remain high in China.&#13;
In view of some of the points made above, particularly concerning ports,&#13;
roads, and passenger traffic, investments could well be higher than in the&#13;
past to avoid constraints on economic development.&#13;

In China, transportion uses only 7.8% of the final commercial energy consumed&#13;
in the country, while shares in other developing countries are over 20%,&#13;
except for Korea, where it is 12%. Similarly, transportation accounts for&#13;
only 24% of petroleum product consumption in China, while shares of 40% or&#13;
higher are common abroad.&#13;
Railways&#13;
5.03      One of the reasons why transport accounts for such a low share of&#13;
energy consumption in China clearly has to do with the dominance of rail&#13;
transport and corresponding underdevelopment of road transport. Another&#13;
reason is the energy inefficiency of other economic sectors which make the&#13;
proportion use for transport appear unduly small. According to the available&#13;
statistics, freight transport by rail consumes roughly one-ninth of the energy&#13;
per payload ton-km as freight transport by road in China. While the relative&#13;
energy efficiencies of different modes may be very different in other countries,&#13;
such a wide differential between modal efficiencies are common - in India,&#13;
rail freight transport is also almost ten times as energy efficient as road&#13;
freight transport. In the U.S.A., however, rail freight transport is about&#13;
four times as energy efficient as road freight transport.&#13;
5.04      Currently, coal-fired steam locomotives account for about 80% of the&#13;
total gross converted ton-km (ctkm) 10, of rail transport, followed by diesel&#13;
traction at 20% and electric traction at 2%. Unit consumption of diesel&#13;
locomotives in China compares favorably with most other countries. Steam&#13;
locomotives consume about 17.3 kg of coal equivalent (of 7,000 Kcal/kg) per&#13;
1,000 ctkm as diesel or electric locomotives.&#13;

Much of the difference can be attributed to China's own-account trucking&#13;
sector. Own-account trucks currently consume roughly twice as much fuel per&#13;
payload ton-km as trucks run by state transport departments, and they account&#13;
for 89% of China's truck fleet and about two-thirds of the total ton-km of&#13;
road freight moved. Although own-account trucks may be older and in poorer&#13;
condition than trucks operated by transport departments, on average, the most&#13;
important factor underlying the different unit consumption rates between own-&#13;
account and transport department trucks is a difference in average load fac-&#13;
tors.12/ The average load factor for transport department trucks currently&#13;
exceeds 62%, which is only slightly lower than the average load 13actor for&#13;
trucks on the Interstate Highway System in the U.S.A. in 1976.-       Own account&#13;
trucks in China, however, are believed to have an average load factor in the&#13;
neighborhood of 30%.&#13;
5.06      Additional factors which contribute to high fuel consumption rates&#13;
in both transport department and own-account trucks include prevailing truck&#13;
sizes, engine efficiencies, road conditions, fuel quality, and operating&#13;
standards. As shown in Annex Table 5.1, rated fuel consumption per payload&#13;
ton-km drops sharply as truck sizes increases. Unlike most developed&#13;
countries, road conditions in China are not appropriate for trucks with&#13;
payloads over 20 tons. While several models in the 8-ton range have been&#13;
developed and used, the vast majority of freight is moved by trucks in the 4-5&#13;
ton range. This brings a major penalty in terms of energy efficiency. Most&#13;
Chinese gasoline truck engines also operate with compression ratios of about&#13;
6-7, compared to averages of about 8.5 abroad. This is primarily due to the&#13;
low octane content of gasoline currently produced for the domestic market&#13;
(66-70, compared to about 90 for regular gasoline in the U.S.A.). Moreover,&#13;
less than 20% of China's highway network is paved with asphalt. Poor road&#13;
conditions, and low average operating speeds due to these conditions and&#13;
congested, slow-moving traffic further contribute to high consumption rates.&#13;
All of these factors combined result in the fuel efficiency of Chinese trucks&#13;
being lower than that of most modern trucks abroad operating under ideal&#13;
conditions.&#13;
6. SOME TRANSPORT ISSUES FOR CHINA&#13;
6.01       As indicated in the previous chapters, Chinese transport is charac-&#13;
terized by the predominance of freight over passenger movements. The high&#13;
freight intensity can largely be explained by the sectoral composition of the&#13;
economy and the minimal role of the service sector. When freight intensity is&#13;
related to output excluding the service sector, the transport intensity in&#13;
12/  Average load factor =        Payload&#13;
Vehicle capacity&#13;
13/  In 1976, empty truck capacity miles (including the empty truck capacity&#13;
miles of partially loaded trucks) accounted for 27.1% of total truck&#13;
capacity miles. Interstate Commerce Commission, Empty/Loaded Truck Miles&#13;

China appears less out of line with that of other economies. Nevertheless,&#13;
even with the present economic structure9 improvements can still be made to&#13;
reduce freight transport demand. Various examples have been quoted regarding&#13;
preparation or partial processing before transport of coal9 ores9 timber9 etc.&#13;
6.02      Another factor that may result in excess transport is the degree of&#13;
vertical integration of industry combined with some administrative rigidities&#13;
which may result in cross hauls and longer transport distances than neces-&#13;
sary. This matter is linked to the location of resources and historical&#13;
development of various sectors of the economy.      When making decisions on&#13;
creation or expansion of certain productions, close attention should be paid&#13;
to transport. Trade-offs should be considered between production closer to&#13;
markets9 possibly at higher production costs but lower transport costs9 with a&#13;
view to minimize total cost including transport. This is particularly true&#13;
for coal where production close to markets in the northeast and southwest&#13;
should be compared with coal production in Shanxi at lower cost but with&#13;
longer transport distances to markets in the northeast and the south0 Another&#13;
alternative could be to locate more industry near natural resources0 Other&#13;
commodities for which distribution studies could be considered in China are,&#13;
grain and in particular feed grains from north to south; fertilizer including&#13;
the distribution of domestic production and of imports; and cement, for which&#13;
plant size increases will have an impact on transport distances. Such studies&#13;
are always difficult because they cut across various administrative jurisdic-&#13;
tions involved in the production, consumption and distribution (including&#13;
transport) of particular commodities, they are nevertheless very useful in&#13;
identifying rationalization measures and cost savings0&#13;
6.03       The appropriate role of the various transport modes is also an area&#13;
for further consideration in China0 There is no doubt that the railways will&#13;
continue to dominate the transport scene in the future, although possibly&#13;
somewhat less exclusively than now0    The international comparison shows the&#13;
potential for greater use of other modes in parallel and also in conjunction&#13;
with the railways0 Road transport is very suitable for the distribution of&#13;
agricultural produce and also for many light industry products. It is also&#13;
the only way to provide mobility to the great m.'asses in the rural areas0 Its&#13;
development raises issues for investment as well as energy which are discussed&#13;
below0 Water transport, both inland and coastal, is another F.iode which should&#13;
continue to be developed for bulk commodities such as coal, petroleum and&#13;
grain, and possibly others0 Development of domestic water transport combined&#13;
with increasing foreign trade will put great pressure on the ports and raise&#13;
issues of investment planning and location in relation with hinterlands.&#13;
Finally, domestic aviation should also receive greater emphasis for long&#13;
distance passenger travel0&#13;
6.04      There is no question that transport demand for both freight and&#13;
passenger will continue to grow rapidly0 Given the new directions of the&#13;
economy, demand could well grow faster than in the past despite some ration-&#13;
alization which may temper freight transpo-t growth, such as energy conserva-&#13;
tion; processing of raw materials; and improvement in distribution chains of&#13;
various commodities0 On the other hand, rationalization of p-oduction mey&#13;
lead to increased transport demand resulting from fewer but larger plants-,&#13;
production at locations endowed with comparative advantages; and greater&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
specialization of industry. As shown by the international comparison,&#13;
increasing incomes result universally in more demand for personal travel. The&#13;
elasticities of demand are also much greater at lower than higher income&#13;
levels. The implications for China is that travel wouLd increase faster than&#13;
income, but how much of this demand will be apparent will depend upon Govern-&#13;
ment policies, including the share of GNP allocated to consumption and the&#13;
capacity to invest in passenger transport infrastructure and rolling stock.&#13;
6.05      This continued rapid growth of transport which could substantially&#13;
exceed the overall growth of the economy will require continuous massive&#13;
investments between now and the year 2000. Railway investments will continue&#13;
to be large in the earlier years while other modes are gradually developed.&#13;
Port investments will also have high priority. The development of roads and&#13;
road transport can be expected to take a gradually increasing share. Total&#13;
transport investments absorbing between 2% and 4% of CNP would appear quite in&#13;
line with those of other countries and necessary to avoid crippling overall&#13;
economic development.&#13;
6.06      A particular problem of road transport development is the related&#13;
demand for liquid fuel. Estimates show that even a comparatively modest&#13;
development of road transport, in comparison with other countries, could&#13;
generate a demand for liquid fuel five times higher than the current level of&#13;
about 10 million tons. (Current oil production is around 100 million tons&#13;
p.a..) A related issue is the need to improve energy efficiency of road&#13;
vehicles, including the merit to shift to alternative fuels. While diesel&#13;
engines are more efficient for large trucks, gasoline engines can more easily&#13;
be converted to LPG and even to natural gas. The use of alternative fuels,&#13;
such as gas and alcohols, for the transport sector are certainly worth&#13;
investigating in the case of China in view of the constraints on oil&#13;
production.&#13;

freight turnover for 1960-1978 was increased to reflect the freight for own account trucking which is not&#13;
available in the Statistical Yearbook. Estimates were made based on its relationship to common carrier&#13;
freight given for 1979-1982.&#13;

lb Data is unclear as to whether diesel oil or gasoline is consumed. In these figure,tt is assumed that gasoline is&#13;
used.&#13;
/c TATA and Beaver trucks often carry payloads higher than the rated payloads given - indeed, Indian laws allou actual&#13;
payloads to exceed the given rated payloads by as much as 25Z. Higher payloads would entail higher energy&#13;
efficiencies than those given.&#13;
Note: Energy consumption per ton-km (1,000 kilocalories) is computed in addition to fuel consumption (liters), as the&#13;
trucks listed for China consume gasoline, while the large trucks in other countries consume diesel oil, Diesel&#13;
oil is converted at 8,030 kcal/l, while gasoline is converted at 7.720 kcal/l.&#13;

            Transport in China : a comparison of basic
            indicators with those of other countries
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper compares China's
            transport indicators with those of other countries and
            attempts to define prospects for the future development of
            transport in China. The share of transport in the economy is
            briefly discussed. Factors contributing to the high
            freight-transport intensity in China are: country size and
            resource location; the structure of the economy and, in
            particular, the small role of the service sector in China;
            the degree of processing of raw materials; and the
            administrative structure and vertical integration of
            industry which often results in circuitous routings and
            excessive transport. In contrast to freight, passenger
            traffic volumes are low, as is personal mobility, in
            comparison with other countries in the same income range.
            This is also partly because capital investments in the
            transport sector have been small, with priority given to
            freight movement. Investment levels are discussed together
            with their productivity. The low share of total energy
            consumed in the transport sector in China in comparison with
            other countries and the fuel consumption of railways and
            road vehicles are also discussed.
