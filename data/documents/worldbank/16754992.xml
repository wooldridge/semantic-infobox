&amp;#12;            The ICSID Caseload â&#128;&#147; Statistics&#13;
                                               (Issue 2012-2)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This issue of the ICSID Caseload â&#128;&#147; Statistics provides an updated profile of the ICSID caseload,&#13;
historically and for the Centreâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal year 2012. It is based on cases registered or administered&#13;
by ICSID as of June 30, 2012.&#13;
&#13;
As in the previous issues, this document illustrates: the number of cases registered under the&#13;
ICSID Convention and Additional Facility Rules; the number of other cases administered by the&#13;
ICSID Secretariat; the basis of consent to ICSID jurisdiction invoked in registered arbitration and&#13;
conciliation cases; the geographic distribution of ICSID cases by the State party to the dispute;&#13;
the economic sectors involved in ICSID disputes; the outcomes in ICSID arbitration and&#13;
conciliation proceedings (including further information on disputes decided by arbitral&#13;
tribunals); the nationality and geographic origins of arbitrators, conciliators and ad hoc&#13;
committee members appointed in ICSID proceedings; and outcomes to date in annulment&#13;
proceedings under the ICSID Convention.&#13;
&#13;
The Secretariat will continue to publish the ICSID Caseload â&#128;&#147; Statistics on a bi-annual basis&#13;
reflecting new information as it becomes available. ICSID welcomes any comments or&#13;
suggestions by email at ICSIDsecretariat@worldbank.org.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
         The ICSID Secretariat offers various levels of administrative and organizational support for non-ICSID&#13;
         dispute settlement in State-State or investor-State proceedings. Among the State-State cases administered&#13;
         in the past decade are the Southern Bluefin Tuna case (Australia and New Zealand v. Japan), an expert&#13;
         determination proceeding under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, and an arbitration under the Softwood&#13;
         Lumber Agreement of 2006 (United States v. Canada).&#13;
&#13;
         The Centre also frequently provides administrative assistance to investor-State arbitrations under the&#13;
         UNCITRAL Rules or other ad hoc dispute settlement provisions. The Centreâ&#128;&#153;s services in these proceedings&#13;
         range from support with the organization of hearings to administrative services comparable to those&#13;
         provided in ICSID cases. The Secretariat also acts as appointing authority, and decides proposals for&#13;
         disqualification of arbitrators, upon request. In addition to administering UNCITRAL arbitrations, ICSID has&#13;
         also assisted with the organization of hearings in arbitration proceedings conducted under the auspices of&#13;
         the ICC, LCIA, PCA, and other institutions.&#13;

            The ICSID caseload : statistics
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This issue of the International Center
            for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) caseload -
            statistics provides an updated profile of the ICSID
            caseload, historically and for the Centre's fiscal year
            2012. It is based on cases registered or administered by
            ICSID as of June 30, 2012.  As in the previous issues, this
            document illustrates: the number of cases registered under
            the ICSID convention and additional facility rules; the
            number of other cases administered by the ICSID Secretariat;
            the basis of consent to ICSID jurisdiction invoked in
            registered arbitration and conciliation cases; the
            geographic distribution of ICSID cases by the State party to
            the dispute; the economic sectors involved in ICSID
            disputes; the outcomes in ICSID arbitration and conciliation
            proceedings (including further information on disputes
            decided by arbitral tribunals); the nationality and
            geographic origins of arbitrators, conciliators and ad hoc
            committee members appointed in ICSID proceedings; and
            outcomes to date in annulment proceedings under the ICSID Convention.
