Lewis T. Preston, President of the Agency and Chairman of thze Board of Directors. I&#13;
submits this reportand the accompanying audiredfinancial statementsforihefiscalyear&#13;
ending June 30,1993, on behalf of the Board to the Council of Governors in accordance&#13;
with the bylaws of the Agency.                                          j&#13;
The Board of Directors of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency is pleased&#13;
to report tiat MIGA's insurance, investment promotion. and advisory services grew&#13;
faster than planned during fiscal 1993.&#13;
MIGA's programs are designed to encourage the flowt of private foreign direct&#13;
investmentfor producrive purposes to and between developing member countries. MIGA&#13;
facilitates capital flows by providing insurance for private investors against noncom-&#13;
mercial risks, by promoting investment activity, and by helping counrries create an&#13;
attractive investment climate. MIGA thus complements the development activities of the&#13;
other memrber agencies of the World Bank Group.&#13;
A special five-year retrospective derailing the evolution of MIGA's growth and&#13;
program activitiesfrom April1988 toJune 30,1993, is included at the end oft/hisAnnual&#13;

MIGA and the environment&#13;
Since MIGA's inception it has taken steps to ensure that the projects it assists operate&#13;
in an environmentally sound manner and meet appropriate eavironmental standards. The&#13;
more stringent of the host country's requirements or the World Bank Group's environ-&#13;
mental guidelines are applied to each project&#13;
As anew institution, MIGA recognizes that its volume of business could not support&#13;
the establishment of a full-time environmental unit to assess each project's environmen-&#13;
tal impact on the host country. MIGA has therefore entered into an agreement with the&#13;
IFC for its Technical and Environmental Department to serve as MIGA's enviromnental&#13;
adviser. Both parties have benefited from this anrangement&#13;

Fmancial Institutions: Waiver of provisioning requirements for country risk&#13;
Private financial institutions, especially commercial banks, face a number of hurdles&#13;
when they consider doing business in a developing country-whether setting up or&#13;
expanding a branch or subsidiary bank, participating in a limited-recourse private&#13;
financing in a developing country, or even following a client to a developing country and&#13;
lending to its new ventum. One of the more difficult hurdles for such banks is the&#13;
provisioning requirements of their national regulatory banking authorities, which effec-&#13;
tively raise the banks' costs of lending to projects in developing countries or, in extreme&#13;
cases, preclude such lending.&#13;
To address this problem, MIGA initiated discussions with bankig regulators in a&#13;
number of industrial countries. So far MIGA has successfully concluded discussions in&#13;
seven countries-Belgium, F:rance, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the&#13;
United Kingdom. These countries have agreed to exempt their banks rom pmvisioning&#13;
requirements for country nsk (or to greatly reduce the provisioning requirements) if they&#13;
have aMIGA guarantee. MIGA is now working with the regulatory authorities of several&#13;
other European countries to obtain similar rulings.&#13;
These agreements have already had an impact on MIGA's volume of business with&#13;
banks establishing or expanding activities in developing countries. In the longer term the&#13;
agreements will also encourage more bank participation in limited-recourse financing&#13;
and allow banks to pursue opporunmities they would not otherwise be able to undertake.&#13;
Such MIGA-facilitated investments in the financial sector will promote competition&#13;
in developing countries and increase the pool of capital available for lending to private&#13;
sector projects. For large-scale private projects (in the energy sector, for example) the&#13;
increase in the potential pool of capital afforded by waiver of these provisioning&#13;
requirements could be significant in determining whether a given project wil proceed.&#13;

A MIGA-assisted mining venture in Guyana has a strong impact on development&#13;
in fiscal 1992 MIGA issued two reinsurance conract totaling $49.8 million for the&#13;
Canadian Export Development Corporation's insurance of Cambior's $163 million&#13;
equity and loan guarantee contributions to Omai Gold Mine, Ltd. in Guyana. MIGA's&#13;
reinsmancecovers Cambioragainsttherisksofcurrency transfer, expropriation, and war&#13;
and civil dinsturbance.&#13;
Cambior, Inc. established a Guyanese subsidiary, Omai Gold Mines, Ltd., to manage&#13;
and operate the mining facility in which it holds 65 percent ownership. The government&#13;
of Guyana and Golden Star Resources, Ltd. (a Canadian mining company) are the other&#13;
shareholders. The Omai Mine is in a remote area some one hundred miles south of&#13;
Georgetown, the capital of Guyana- It is Guyana's first major go1d mining operation and&#13;
is expected to become one of the largest gold mines in South America. Total investment&#13;
in the project is $181 million, and the annual average gold production over a ten-year&#13;
period is estimated to be 210,000 ounces.&#13;
The project is already having a strong developmental impact on the country and on the&#13;
local economy through the creation of jobs and the development of local infrastructure.&#13;
Eight hundred new jobs have resulted for Guyanese, many of whom will benefit from a&#13;
comprehensive $1.4 million training program. In addition, the local economy is being&#13;
stimulated through spending on goods and services estimated at more than $19 million&#13;
during the first three years of operation. Guyana is also benefiting from Cambiors&#13;
developmentoftelecommunicationsfacilities andthe constructionofdocksites, wharves,&#13;
roads, and a medical center. Net foreign exchange eamings from the project are estmated&#13;
to be about $35 million a year, and the project is expected to produce a cumulative net&#13;
cash flow forthe govermment from royalties, taxes, and dividends of about $100 million&#13;
over eight years.&#13;
Cambior is clearly committed to acting in an environmentally responsible fashion.&#13;

A new management information system for investment promotion agencies&#13;
During fiscal 1993 MIGA participated in the development of a state-of-the-art&#13;
computer-based management information system initiated and funded by HIAS. This&#13;
system will help investmentpromotion agencies around the world improve their capacity&#13;
to manage investmnent promotion and achieve world standards of effectiveness. The&#13;
computer-based system is both sophisticated and user-friendly, generic and readily&#13;
adoptable to specific county situations. YIGA and FIAS are working jointly to&#13;
introduce the two main opertional components of the system-4he investor tracking&#13;
system and the business operating conditions database-into investment promotion&#13;
agencies. A training package on how to conduct successful investment promotion&#13;
activities accompanies the software. Preparations are under way to introduce the new&#13;
system into countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America.&#13;
FIAS's advisory assistance to the Russia Federation&#13;
Following its participation in the Study of the Soviet Economy, sponsored jointly by&#13;
the Organization for Economic Cooperaton and Development, the RIMF, the World&#13;
Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, FIAS has provided&#13;
advisory assistance to several counties of the former Soviet Union. As part of the&#13;
Technical Cooperation Program of the World Bank and the Russian Federation, FIAS,&#13;
with assistance from MIGA, conducted an extensive study of the foreign direct invest-&#13;
ment environment of Russia The study addressed questions of foreign exchange rates&#13;
and controls, legal impediments to foreign direct investment, the screening and approval&#13;
of foreign investment projects, and corporate income taxation and tax incentives. It also&#13;
offered comments on Russia's foreign investment law and on the role of foreign direct&#13;
investment in developing Russia's financial sector, notably in banking, leasing, venture&#13;
capital, and securities dealing and brokerage.&#13;
After the study was completed, the government requested FIAS's advice on the&#13;
institutional development of the Russian Agency for International Cooperation and&#13;
Development. Working closely with the agency, FHAS helped it define its role in&#13;
regulating and promoting foreign direct investment in Russia and in designting mecha-&#13;
nisms and structures for dealing with foreign investment.&#13;
FIAS has also provided advisory assistance to Russia on an informal basis, including&#13;
reactions to amendments of its foreign investment law being developed by a Committee&#13;
of the Supreme Soviet, and advice, at the request of the Privatization Ministry, on several&#13;
foreign investment issues related to privatization.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
FIAS expands its activities in Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
FIAS has advised more than two-thirds of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. In&#13;
fiscal 1993 FIAS began work in eight African countries in which it had not worked before&#13;
and completed projects in ten countries. Completed projects included general diagnoses&#13;
of investment policy issues in COte d'lvoire, Mauritania, Namibia, Sudan, Zambia, and&#13;
Zimbabwe; preparation of new investment legislation in Ghana and Zambia; formula-&#13;
tion of short-term measures to assist in investment promotion in C8te d'Ivoire; and study&#13;
of foreign exchange and debt-swap issues in Tanzania.&#13;
At the close of the fiscal year FIAS was developing assignments in C8te d'Ivoire,&#13;
Ethiopia, Ghana, and Swaziland and preparing follow-up projects in six countries. FIAS&#13;
also organized afour-session workshop forAfrican ambassadors to the United States on&#13;
foreign investment issues, sponsored by Africare and the Georgetown University&#13;
Institute for the Study of Diplomacy. In collaboration with MIGA, FIAS also organized&#13;
workshops in Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimnbabwe on the importance of deregulation in the&#13;
countries' overall efforts to improve their investment environment.&#13;

MIGA in Latin America&#13;
At the time of MIGA's founding there was considerable skepticism about a role for&#13;
the Agency in Latin America. Many observers were afraid that Latin America's&#13;
traditional resistance to investment insurance programs would keep a substantial number&#13;
of Lain states from joining MIGA.&#13;
This did not happen. MlGA's staff have made special efforts from the beginning to&#13;
demonstrate the compatibility of MIGA's operations with local laws and customs in&#13;
Latn  America. These efforts have bome fruit during the past three years virtually all&#13;
countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region have joined MIGA. Participation&#13;
in MCGA has gone hand in hand with recent efforts by the Latin states to open their&#13;
economies.&#13;
The results have been dramatic. Within two years Latin America has become the&#13;
region with the second largest number of MIGA-supported projects. Of the sixty-three&#13;
insurance contracts wntten by MIGA in its first five years, seventeen cover investments&#13;
in Latin America and the Caribbean. As of June 30, 1993, one-third of MIGA's&#13;
contingent liability was concentrated in the region. Similarly, Latin Amercan states are&#13;
increasingly drawing on the technical assistance services of MIGA and FIAS-&#13;

foreign investmnent by both private investors and commercially operated public sector companies. Its&#13;
facilities includecguaranteesagainstnoncommcrciaI risks and aprogram of consul rative and advisory&#13;
services to promote improvements in mecmber countrices environments for foreign investmnent.&#13;
Note A: Summary of Signiricant Accounting and Related Policies&#13;
MIGA's financial statements have been prepared in conformnity with International Accounting&#13;
Standards. In the absence of such standards, then, subject to relevant legal requirements, the policy&#13;
adopted is that considered most appropriate to the circumstances of MIGA having regard to the&#13;
accounting principles used in the United States and the practices of other international insurance&#13;
entities. The following summary of policies adopted by MIGA is provided to assist readers in the&#13;
interpretation of these financial statements. The accounting policies followed generally am consis-&#13;
tent int all mLaterial repecs with accounting principles in the United States.&#13;
Translation of Currendes&#13;
MGGA's financial statements are expressed in terms of United States dollars solely for the purpose&#13;
of sumiaarizing financial position and the results of its operations for the convenience of its members&#13;
and other interested parties.&#13;
MIGA is an international or-ganization that conducts its operations in the currencies of all its&#13;
members. MIGA!s resources are derived from its capital and accumulated earniings in its memnbers'&#13;
currencies. MIGA strives to mintimize exchange rate risks in a multicurrency envirornment As such,&#13;
MIGA attempts to match its contingent obligations in any one cunrency with assets in the same&#13;
cunrrncy.&#13;
Accordingly, MIGA may periodically undertake currency conversions to match the currencies&#13;
underlying its reserves with those of the outstading contingencies. The purpose of these conversions&#13;
winl be to minirnizt. currency exposure that may occur though operations. Otherwise, MIGA win&#13;
not convert one currency into another except for small amounts required to meet certain operational&#13;
needs.&#13;
Assets and liabilities are tanslated at market rates of exchange at the end of the period. Capital&#13;
subscriptions are stated in accordance with th e procedures described below. Incomec and expenses are&#13;
generally traslated at an average of the market rates of exchange in effect during each month.&#13;
Translaton adjustmnents are charged or credited to retained earniings.&#13;

g- ~Valustion of Capital Stock&#13;
Under the MIGA Convention, all payments from members subscribing to the capital stock of MIGA&#13;
shall be settled on the basis of the average value of the SDRin terms of United States dollars forthe&#13;
period January 1, 1981 to June 30, 1985, such value being equal to $1.082 for one SDR. The&#13;
Convention fur  erstates that ten percentofthe members'shares be paid in cash, in fieely convertible&#13;
currencies, except that developing member countries may pay up to a quarter of the ten percent in&#13;
theirowncunrencies. Inaddition anothertenpercentofthemembers' sharesshalUbepaidin theform&#13;

convertile currencies and are due on demand. The policies relating to trnslation of cunrrncies&#13;
described above also apply to the cash and the promnissoy notes paid im&#13;
Investments&#13;
In fiscal years ended June 30, 1991 and 1992, investment holdings were valued at market&#13;
Commencing in the current fiscal year, MJGANs investment holdings are valLzed at cost or amortized&#13;
cost-as MIGA is extending the duration of its investments and generaly holds its investments to&#13;
maturity. There was no cumulative effect from this change. Gains or losses on sale of investments,&#13;
mneasured by the difference between the cost (on a last-in, first-out basis) and proceeds of sales, are&#13;
recorded as an element of income from investments.&#13;
Due to the nature of the investments held by the Agency and its policies governing the level and use&#13;
of such investments, the Agency classifies the investment portfolio as an element of liquidity in the&#13;
Statement of Cash FRows.&#13;
Revenue Recognition&#13;
Revenue fiom prerium payments for both direct and assumed reinsurance contrats is reognized&#13;
on a prorata basis over the contract period. Revenue from commitment fees, which are fees paid by&#13;
investors to reserve for a limited period of time guarntee capacity for future use, is recognized on&#13;
a pro rat basis over the commitment period.&#13;
Reserve for Claims&#13;
The reserve for claims provides for losses inherent in guarantee operations based upon claim&#13;
submissions, consideration of loss experiences by insurers engaged in similar underwritings, and&#13;
other factors including changes in the composition and volume of the insurance and outstanding&#13;
guarantees and worldwide economic and political conditions. The reserve is increased by provisions&#13;
charged to expense and deeased for claims settlements.&#13;
Recognizingthe fact that during the early years of theAgency's operations when its reserves are smal l&#13;
in relation to its obligations :ssumed under its insurance activities and when there is limited history&#13;
for estimation of losses, it is understood that the promissory note portion of the subscribed capital&#13;
would be utilized to pay any claims in excess of the reserve.&#13;
Acquisition Costs&#13;
Costs of acquiring investment guarantees are expensed in the year incurred, as such amounts are not&#13;
material.&#13;
