Urban Sanitation in Indonesia:&#13;
Planning for Progress&#13;
Providing Powerful Incentives for Cities&#13;
Urban sanitation planning needs to be more than a voluntary activity if it is to be undertaken&#13;
nationwide. Government needs to develop both incentives and obligations for municipalities to&#13;
adopt comprehensive strategies, by linking funding to the adoption of city-wide sanitation plans.&#13;
&amp;#12;    Barely 1% of the population has access to sewerage and while most&#13;
    households have a toilet, many of these discharge into open drains and&#13;
    water courses.&#13;

(Dinas Kebersihan) or the environmental&#13;
services agency (Dinas Lingkungan&#13;
Hidup) take a lead role, though no&#13;
agency has a speciï¬?c responsibility to&#13;
promote household toilets. In the case of&#13;
sewerage (where it exists) responsibility&#13;
may lie with the wastewater management&#13;
utility (PDPAL), the water utility (PDAM),&#13;
the water resources department (Dinas&#13;
Sumber Daya Air), or the department of&#13;

These agencies employ a substantial&#13;
number of graduate and postgraduate&#13;
staff in larger cities, but expertise in urban&#13;
sanitation planning and service delivery is&#13;
quite limited.                                                                                  than 200 fecal sludge treatment plants&#13;

 BOX 4: SUMMARY OF URBAN SANITATION CHALLENGES IN INDONESIA&#13;
&#13;
 ISSDP is a vehicle for addressing critical challenges in the sector at all levels. These include:&#13;
&#13;
 At national level&#13;
 â&#128;¢ Low political priorities, due to prevalent views on responsibility for sanitation at all levels of government. Sanitation needs to be higher on the&#13;
    political agenda if it is to get the attention it deserves, and can no longer be regarded as purely a private matter in urban areas.&#13;
 â&#128;¢ The urgent need for a national urban sanitation policy that sets priorities, deï¬?nes institutional and community roles and responsibilities,&#13;
    establishes a legal and regulatory framework, and facilitates the adoption of comprehensive city-wide sanitation strategies.&#13;
 â&#128;¢ The need for an investment framework and ï¬?nancing strategy, both to increase the total funding available in the sector and to enable those&#13;
    funds to be deployed effectively.&#13;
 â&#128;¢ The need for advocacy to make the sanitation crisis an issue of national concern.&#13;
&#13;
 At provincial level&#13;
 â&#128;¢ The need to clarify the role of the provincial government in the funding of urban infrastructure investments and the planning and delivery of&#13;
    sanitation services.&#13;
 â&#128;¢ A lack of capacity for sanitation promotion and progress monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
 At city level&#13;
 â&#128;¢ A lack of mechanisms for inter-agency collaboration on planning and service delivery, bearing in mind the range of organizations that have&#13;
    a stake in sanitation.&#13;
 â&#128;¢ A lack of incentives and accountability for the achievement of national sanitation goals. At present, not all municipalities would accept that&#13;
    there is a big problem with excreta disposal.&#13;
 â&#128;¢ Limited municipal capacity for planning, infrastructure development, service delivery and sanitation promotion.&#13;
 â&#128;¢ Complicated and poorly understood mechanisms for accessing and allocating capital funds.&#13;
 â&#128;¢ An under-developed (and unregulated) role for the private sector in service delivery and maintenance (for example in the safe removal,&#13;
    treatment and disposal of septic tank sludge).&#13;
 â&#128;¢ Poor operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
 At community and household level&#13;
 â&#128;¢ Limited appreciation of the need for safe disposal of wastewater, though toilet use is widely practiced.&#13;
 â&#128;¢ Many people occupy land illegally and are excluded from municipal projects and planning processes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In Phase I there were four components:             targeted promotional campaigns (national            The absence of an infrastructure&#13;

regulation, institutions, strategies and           Component 4: Local level capacity                   to appreciate why it focused on the&#13;
action plans. This component was                   building and development of city-wide,              â&#128;&#152;enabling frameworkâ&#128;&#153; â&#128;&#147; a concept that&#13;

    â&#128;&#147; particularly the use of communal shame as a motivating factor â&#128;&#147; proved to be quite               shortcomings of existing sanitation&#13;
    effective.                                                                                         services in the cities, particularly poor&#13;

BOX 7: WHITE BOOK&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   The results of sanitation mapping in ISSDP are reported in a document called the White Book. The white books&#13;
   prepared by six cities involved in ISSDP generally consist of seven chapters. In addition to an introductory chapter, the&#13;
   chapters generally discuss:&#13;
   â&#128;¢    City Overview, which is a brief description of the geographic and topographic characteristics of the city,&#13;
        administrative districts, current land-use, municipal government structure, the vision and mission of the city, and&#13;
        demographic and socio-economic conditions.&#13;
   â&#128;¢    City Sanitation Status, which describes the condition and level of existing sanitation services (wastewater,&#13;
        solid waste, drainage system), public health conditions, current and planned sanitation programs and activities,&#13;
        sanitation-related institutions and regulations, and funding for sanitation.&#13;
   â&#128;¢    City Sanitation Problems, which describes problems that have impeded or may impede the development of&#13;
        sanitation services. These problems may be related to technical or supporting aspects (community participation,&#13;
        policy and regulation, institution,&#13;
        non-government        involvement,&#13;
        ï¬?nancing).&#13;
   â&#128;¢    Indicative Sanitation Development&#13;
        Plan,     which     illustrates a)&#13;
        sanitation development trends,&#13;
        needs, and opportunities, and b)&#13;
        recommendations for intervention.&#13;
   â&#128;¢    Identiï¬?cation     of     Priority&#13;
        Areas, which identiï¬?es city&#13;
        wards (kelurahan) prioritized for&#13;
        sanitation development (see box&#13;
        on the left).&#13;
   â&#128;¢    Summary and Conclusion,&#13;
        which brieï¬&#130;y describes issues&#13;
        requiring attention when preparing&#13;
        the citywide sanitation strategy,&#13;
        including recommended activities&#13;
        for sanitation development.&#13;
&#13;
   The White Book is usually accompanied&#13;
   by an executive summary, aimed at&#13;
   city decision makers. Generally, an&#13;
   ofï¬?cial cover letter signed by a high-&#13;
   ranking city ofï¬?cial is also a part of the&#13;
   White Book. Payakumbuh Municipality&#13;
   White Book, for example, is signed by&#13;
   the mayor.&#13;

&amp;#12;        While working with the city sanitation working groups, the program has&#13;
        sought to integrate sanitation planning with established government&#13;
        planning and budgeting cycles so that it is not seen as a parallel and&#13;
        purely project-related activity, but part of the routine business of local&#13;
        government.&#13;

         Documenting the citywide            Like the sanitation working groups in other cities involved in ISSDP activities, the Jambi sanitation&#13;
              sanitation strategy            working group developed a citywide sanitation strategy document comprising ten volumes. The                  sanitation services will be operated and&#13;
                                             volumes can be grouped as follows: 1) documents related to the sanitation development framework,&#13;
                                             2) documents related to the strategy for sanitation services development, and 3) documents related           sustained, both physically and ï¬?nancially.&#13;

One important area that has yet to            Now that the planning process has been           health, and are approaching the problem&#13;

plants, for which asset ownership             possibly some simpliï¬?cation of the               importance of comprehensive planning.&#13;
is currently unclear; in the existing         planning process. ISSDP is already               Not only that, it has acknowledged the&#13;
schemes, the plants were nominally put        making a start by developing training of         need for strategic action at national level,&#13;
under community management yet the            trainers programs for city facilitators, and     especially on sector ï¬?nancing. Sanitation&#13;

initial period. The ability and willingness   resource for the sector.                         sector.&#13;
of communities to sustain these facilities&#13;
varies from place to place, but generally&#13;
they do not deal with major maintenance&#13;
and repairs. More work is needed to&#13;
explore the scope for local private sector&#13;
and neighborhood organizations taking&#13;
on maintenance responsibility, though&#13;
asset ownership must ï¬?rst be clariï¬?ed.&#13;
&#13;
Looking beyond the six cities, a pivotal&#13;
question is whether, and how, city-wide&#13;
sanitation planning can be adopted more&#13;
widely, bearing in mind that there is no&#13;
obligation to do so at present. There are&#13;
encouraging signs here, as the Ministry&#13;
of Public Works has informally indicated&#13;
its intention to use the CSS as the basis&#13;
for funding allocations to the six Phase&#13;
I cities. This could provide a powerful&#13;
incentive for other cities to develop their&#13;
own strategies. The extent to which&#13;

            Indonesia - Urban sanitation in Indonesia :
            planning for progress
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Indonesia Sanitation Sector
            Development Program (ISSDP) is a partnership between the
            Government of Indonesia and the World Bank Water and
            Sanitation Program (WSP). It is an innovative and ambitious
            response to the urban sanitation crisis. At the end of its
            first, two-year phase, government ownership of the program,
            both at central and local levels, is strong and a distinct
            shift is evident in the sector. The government has adopted
            national sanitation goals but without a strategy for meeting
            them in urban areas, and municipalities have had difficulty
            accessing funds should they decide to make improvements. The
            ISSDP is an innovative response to the growing sanitation
            crisis; instead of funding investments directly, it fosters
            an enabling environment for progress, with special attention
            to city-level planning, strengthening sector strategy and
            institutional arrangements, and advocacy and
            awareness-raising at all levels. This Field Note examines
            the city-level planning and capacity building process which
            is at the heart of ISSDP and is helping to signal the way
            forward for sector strategy. Central to the process are
            collaboration between the various government organizations
            involved in sanitation at municipal level, and the
            identification of prioritized, affordable actions that will
            enable the cities to move steadily towards effective
            services, city-wide.
