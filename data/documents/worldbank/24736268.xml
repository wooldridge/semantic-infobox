COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENT&#13;
relating to&#13;
Global Inf -astructure Facility Partnership Program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
This Collaboration Arrangement is enlered into on October 9, 2014 between:&#13;
(1)   STANDARD CHARTERED BANK herein represented by its Group Executive Director and (:EJ)&#13;
for EMEA and Americas, and headquartered in England at 1 Basinghall Avenue, London, E C:&#13;
5DD, UK ("Standard Chartered"); and&#13;
(2)   THE WORLD BANK GROUP, comprising the INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPIV Eh &#13;
ASSOCIATION ("IDA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, US \ le&#13;
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION, ("IFC") headquartered at 2121 Pennsylvan&#13;
Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20433, USA, and the MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT&#13;
GUARANTEE AGENCY, ("MIGA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC C 33,&#13;
USA (the "World Bank Group")&#13;
(each a "Party" and together, the "Parties").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad international recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Interl EIti: nal&#13;
Organizations (lOs), the G77, and the private sector represented by the B20 that investin I r :he&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed, to ::p ind&#13;
access to basic services and raise living standards for all, and to meet global economic r vth&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need presents a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on  1.ng&#13;
sources of infrastructure finance-particularly in the public sector-a redoubled and coor:i: :ed&#13;
effort is needed to mobilize private sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of robust pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects anc ii is&#13;
understood to be the greatest barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investm( r 1:&#13;
(D) Governments, development finance institutions, donors, and private investors share an int 4. t in&#13;
developing the market for private infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand i:. in&#13;
the numbers of structurally scund and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual em( - c ice&#13;
of EMDE infrastructure as a ecognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range of Fr ate&#13;
investors that actively particiiate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals will ter efit&#13;
from collective action between this range of entities-to leverage resources and knowli! . to&#13;
find solutions to complex irfrastructure financing challenges that no single institutioi c: uld&#13;
achieve alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, the Parties propose the establishment of a Global Infrastructure F a: lity&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF"). The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at leverac ir C the&#13;
efforts of the wide range of irstitutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastructi ra iith&#13;
the participation of private infrastructure investors, coalescing around project prepi 1 on,&#13;
structuring, and  risk mitigation for individual infrastructure  investments. In this regard,  'i  31F&#13;
aims to complement existing and proposed services and initiatives currently supported I hj the&#13;
Parties and other prospective GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prepe - . ell-&#13;
structured, infrastructure projects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for acces&lt; it C the&#13;
expertise of the Parties and other GIF partners, in combination with guidance from pro, , : :ive&#13;
private sector financiers into project structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater lE e ige&#13;
of official resources in the face of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particular f :I rge&#13;
and complex projects with thE: potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;
(F) The Parties are now interes:ed in collaborating in developing the Global Infrastructure F; ility&#13;
Partnership Program, togethEr with other partners.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
Accordingly, the Parties have come to the following understanding:&#13;
1     Global Infrastructure Facility Partnership Program Framework&#13;
1.1   The GIF is intended to be based on the preliminary objectives and principles set o t in&#13;
Annex 1 (Preliminary GIF Foundational Principles). The Parties acknowledge their mutual&#13;
understanding that while the  3IF Foundational Principles are an initial basis for their collat :on  on,&#13;
they are of an indicative nature and will continue to be developed amongst the Parties and A it&#13;
other potential partners until the GIF is formally established. The final version of these obje:; ii s&#13;
and principles will be agreed upon by the GIF Partners and be reflected in the agreement&#13;
establishing the GIF.&#13;
1.2   The Parties intend to work together with any additional participants who may be&#13;
collaborating on the GIF to further enhance their coordination, in particular by developing tI E C IF,&#13;
with a view to formally establishing the program by December 2014.&#13;
2     Further Collaboration&#13;
2.1   Pursuant to the foregoing, the Parties will use reasonable endeavors to continue tc&#13;
collaborate in developing the 31F, including but not limited to:&#13;

partnership and the roles, rights, and responsibilities associated with each categor,&#13;
b. Governance arrangements of the GIF;&#13;
c. Operational policies applicable to the GIF's operations;&#13;
d. Scope of GIF activities and sources/uses of GIF funds, including approach to projE:.&#13;
selection criteria and coordination with the Parties' existing facilities; and&#13;
e. Any other aspects of :.ollaboration required to finalize the design of the GIF, includ i;&#13;
sharing best practice and experience with regard to project preparation, through th . u! a&#13;
of knowledge platfornis for the infrastructure sector.&#13;
2.2   During the process of finalizing the design of the GIF, the multilateral development bank: li! ted&#13;
in Annex 2 will be invited to participate as initial Technical Partners. Once the GIF dE si is&#13;
finalized, additional collaborative efforts are required to develop the operational details f :i the&#13;
GIF, at all times complementing existing efforts and facilities and building upon the s3 ,1: ed&#13;
knowledge and experience of the Parties in this area. This includes determining the e,': of&#13;
coordination between the Parties and project origination process.&#13;

Annex I&#13;
Preliminary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the G IF is to promote private sector investment in infrastructure pr.: e: :s&#13;
in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparatic r&#13;
provision of appropriate risk mitigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commercial - n:&#13;
institutional investor engagerrent in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex public-private partnerships and projects with potential for commer :il&#13;
viability which require project preparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastrui t1&#13;
financing solutions that no single institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF aims to create a global platform to provide financial and coord n: )n&#13;
resources in collaboration with the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of the F/ e&#13;
range of donor and development finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMDI&#13;
infrastructure, with the input a!d ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engagemer I ::. Old&#13;
stretch from upstream suppori on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to downstream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and risk&#13;
mitigation/credit enhancemeni.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer term, by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structurel I&#13;
infrastructure projects, the Gil: can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset class attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking long-:( r&#13;
assets in faster growing economies, but which until now have been presented only limited&#13;
infrastructure investment opportunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profile&#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to operate according to the following core principles, to be finalize:I ul on&#13;
agreement among GIF partners:&#13;
(i) Leveraging the private sector-specializing in project financing modalities thi ' II&#13;
draw together comparative advantages of public and private sectors;&#13;
(ii) Addressing public goods-focusing on core infrastructure; particularly those&#13;
infrastructure projects that are climate friendly or trade enabling;&#13;
(iii) Promoting susteainability and inclusiveness-ensuring projects adhere to b:!!t&#13;
practice standards for social and environmental responsibility; and&#13;
(iv) Collaborating, complementing and partnering for solutions-mobilizirig te:: n al&#13;
and financial rescurces of all partner entities-World Bank Group entities, mul il di ral&#13;
development institutions, other public institutions, and private investors-in an&#13;
innovative and flexible way, to complement existing capacities, achieve greate&#13;
leverage and address the complex infrastructure financing challenges that are&#13;
beyond the resources of any individual partner.&#13;
3     Institutional Arrangements and Governance&#13;
3.1   The GIF is expected :o involve a wide range of stakeholders who are involved in t1'=&#13;
development and implementation of infrastructure projects, both public and private. GIF pa ti s&#13;
are expected to fall into one cr more of the following categories:&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(i) Funding Partners-Partners that provide financial contributions to the GIF wil IE&#13;
considered Fundi'ig Partners.&#13;
(ii) Technical Partne rs-Partners that can and who will agree to provide specific&#13;
technical advice and support to GIF activities including execution of GIF-funde, I&#13;
activities and/or p-ovision of GIF-backed credit enhancement or liquidity suppo t&#13;
instruments.&#13;
(iii) Advisory Partners-Private investors or entities that represent the voice of&#13;
commercial and/or institutional investment, whether pension funds, insurance&#13;
companies, sovereign wealth funds, banks or other financial institutions, as we I&#13;
other multilateral or bilateral agencies engaged in supporting private sector&#13;
infrastructure projects, to be invited into discussions related to project preparat on&#13;
optimal approaches to financial structuring, and the design and use of risk&#13;
instruments, with a view to ensure suitability of projects for commercial and/or&#13;
institutional inves:ment.&#13;
3.2   A GIF Governing Coincil is proposed to oversee the GIF's strategic programmin,&#13;
management and use of fund:, and development of operational policies and procedures; an&#13;
hold the GIF Management Unit (see section 4.1) accountable for delivering on the facility's&#13;
objectives and principles, wit advice and support from the Advisory Partners. The compoE it ci of&#13;
the Governing Council will be agreed between IBRD and prospective partners, but is propc s:!: to&#13;
comprise representatives of Funding and Technical Partners.&#13;
3.3   An Advisory Council comprised of all GIF partners, chaired by the Managing DirE:&#13;
and Chief Financial Officer of the World Bank Group, will be periodically convened to facilit:. e&#13;
coordination of GIF activities and support GIF operations. This Advisory Council will serve :i .&#13;
sounding board, providing guidance and support for GIF Management, and in particular wi i E&#13;
view to ensuring suitability of projects for private sector investment.&#13;
4     Management&#13;
4.1   The GIF will be administered by the World Bank Group, through a small, dedicate( i -n&#13;
established for this purpose (the GIF Management Unit). The GIF Management Unit will fu it n&#13;
as a coordinating body as prciects are identified for inclusion in the pipeline, and then mov:!&#13;
toward technical support and financing phases. The GIF Management Unit will not lead inc iI dial&#13;
projects.&#13;
4.2   GIF activity implemertation teams will be led by selected staff of Technical Partne&#13;
institutions, coordinated by the GIF Management Unit in consultation with client governmei it I&#13;
according to specific project requirements and the project origination processes. Composi ii of&#13;
the implementation teams may vary according to the need of individual projects and gove n, r nts.&#13;
5     Activities and Projects&#13;
5.1   Project selection criteria and processes could be developed to reflect the follov i&#13;
principles:&#13;
(i) Development Irimpact-projects that support the development goals of the GI&#13;
partner institutions;&#13;
(ii) Alignment-projects that are aligned with recipient/sponsor country priorities :&#13;
strategies;&#13;
(iii) Complexity-projects that require multiple parties to come together to providl&#13;
structuring, arranging and financial support, and/or projects which require a bl I ic f&#13;
financial instruments; and&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(iv) Catalytic Impact -projects that have significant potential to achieve financial i :l: lity,&#13;
leverage public fLnds, and attract private sector and/or institutional investors-  w I&#13;
as through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-while still meeting&#13;
government's ser/ice delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrastructure investments that have global public good characteristic c. ich&#13;
as climate friendly-projects that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provision cf&#13;
infrastructure services; and tride enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconne:i i&#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of support provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, with i v w&#13;
to complementing the resources and support already available from partner entities and oti F&#13;
funding mechanisms. During :he GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following ac ) 1i is,&#13;
corresponding to major project development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; project definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility scr  , ig;&#13;
and legal, regulatbry, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii) Project preparaticn and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and PPP structuring;&#13;
(iii) Transaction support and financial structuring - preparing and implementing&#13;
transactions, and design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; and&#13;
(iv) Financial arrangiig and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing financi I&#13;
packages from a range of sources and partners.&#13;
6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies-including in particular the management of environmental and oc il&#13;
impacts and risks, and transparency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastri c tu e&#13;
projects in supporting sustainable, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial, reputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supported operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements&#13;
external implementing entitie; under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an approach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards anc (t ,r&#13;
standards and policies, and develop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for GI=&#13;
Technical Partners who are expected to function as implementing entities for GIF activities&#13;
