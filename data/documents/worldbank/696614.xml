past decade, more than double the overall national population growth rate. About 80 million&#13;
people, or 40 percent of Indonesians, will be city dwellers by the year 2000. Indonesia's urban&#13;
settlements include 15 metropolitan and large cities of at least half a million people, 40 secondary&#13;
cities of 100,000 to 500,000 residents (provincial capitals and incorporated municipalities), 200&#13;
smaller towns (mainly regency headquarters) of 20,000 to 100,000 population, and about 3,200&#13;
service centers and subdistrict headquarters with 3,000 to 20,000 people. Approximately 70% of&#13;
Indonesia's urban population reside in the cities and towns on the island of Java.&#13;
1.2         Institutional Framework. At the national level, there is no single ministry for&#13;
urban development. The National Development Planning Agency, BAPPENAS, is responsible for&#13;
overall planning and allocation of GOI development resources managed in the framework of Five-&#13;
Year Development Plans (REPELITA) and Annual National Development Budgets (APBN).&#13;
Within BAPPENAS, the Bureau for Urban Development, Settlement and Public Housing, under&#13;
Deputy Chairman V (Regional and Provincial Development), is responsible for oversight and&#13;
coordination of urban infrastructure development, in cooperation with other involved Bureaus&#13;
(e.g. Transport under Deputy I). All key central agencies with responsibilities in the urban sector&#13;
are represented in the Inter-agency Coordinating Team for Urban Development (Tim Koordinasi -&#13;
TKPP) chaired by BAPPENAS.&#13;
1.3         The principal central ministries involved in urban issues are the Ministry of Home&#13;
Affairs, the Ministry of Public Works, and the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Home Affairs&#13;
(MHA) is responsible for oversight of the regional governments, primarily through its Directorate&#13;
General for Public Administration and Regional Autonomy (PUOD) and Directorate General for&#13;
Regional Development (BANGDA). The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) has technical&#13;
responsibility for oversight of most infrastructure development and resulting services provision.&#13;
Within MPW, the following directorates-general are responsible for urban infrastructure: the&#13;
Directorate General for Human Settlements (Cipta Karya or DGCK) is responsible for oversight&#13;
of city and regional planning, water supply, urban drainage, sanitation and sewerage, solid waste&#13;
management, kampung improvement programs (KIP), and market infrastructure improvement&#13;
programs (MIIP); the Directorate General for Roads (Bina Marga or DGBM) is responsible for&#13;
oversight of urban roads and bridges; and the Directorate General for Water Resource&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
Development (Pengairan or DGWRD) is responsible for urban flood control and bulk water&#13;
supply. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is responsible for central and local finance; the&#13;
Directorate General for Budget (Anggaran or DGA) administers budget transfers.&#13;
1.4         At the regional levels, provincial (Level I) and local (Level II) governments&#13;
operate with increasing responsibilities and delegated authority. In all, there are 27 provinces and&#13;
304 local governments, including 57 kotamadyas (urban municipalities) and 247 kabupatens&#13;
(regencies). Legislative powers at both provincial and local levels are held by elected People's&#13;
Representative Councils (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah or DPRD).&#13;
1.5         Under Indonesia's unitary system  of government, all units of sub-national&#13;
government are within the Ministry of Home Affairs. Provincial governments are headed by&#13;
appointed governors who represent the President and the central government; the governors also&#13;
head the semi-autonomous provincial administrations. Bupatis (regency heads) and Walikotas&#13;
(municipal mayors) represent provincial governments, and head their own local governments.&#13;
Regional Development Planning Agencies (BAPPEDA I and II) report directly to their respective&#13;
governors, regency heads or mayors, and are responsible for planning and resource allocation,&#13;
while the senior administrative officer at each level is the Regional Secretary (Sekwilda I and II).&#13;
Regional government services are provided by separate departments (Dinas I and II) analogous to&#13;
line ministries of the central government, who have their own deconcentrated regional offices&#13;
(KANWIL) for implementing central GOI projects.&#13;
1.6         Sectoral Coordination and Local Participation.  Due to the hierarchical&#13;
administrative system, coordination of the urban sector has been difficult. The large size and&#13;
diversity of the country, the rapid pace of urbanization, the number of concerned agencies, poor&#13;
resource allocation and cultural constraints to effective communication within and among&#13;
agencies, have led to a somewhat fragmented approach to urban development. In order to&#13;
improve coordination and targeting of resources to local urban services needs, the Government of&#13;
Indonesia's (GOI) policy of decentralization needs to be pursued more effectively.&#13;
1.7         Increasingly, it is becoming apparent from development experience worldwide that&#13;
effective community involvement leads to improved service provision.  GOI's desire to&#13;
decentralize is requiring the adoption of practical means of public participation, with increased&#13;
accountability of local leaders and government staff. By entering into constructive dialogue with&#13;
the community, officials are also able to better plan and program needed service improvements.&#13;
GOI regulations for annual development budget preparation (the RAKORBANG process) call for&#13;
community consultation and participation at all levels, but implementation of this process is&#13;
uneven.&#13;
1.8         Sector Constraints and Priorities. Average incomes in urban areas have risen&#13;
substantially over the past decade; however, income distribution remains relatively skewed and in&#13;
1990, more than 17 percent of Indonesian urban dwellers were estimated to live in "absolute&#13;
poverty" based on their expenditure levels. The problems of low income are exacerbated by&#13;
deficiencies in basic services and degraded environmental conditions. Country-wide, only about&#13;
20-25 percent of urban households have direct access to piped water supply, another 15 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
buy drinking water from vendors or standposts, and the rest rely on shallow wells and sometimes&#13;
on surface water courses. Surface water courses in urban areas are almost universally polluted&#13;
due to inadequately treated wastewater. Only about 40 percent of urban households have access&#13;
to adequate sanitation facilities. In the larger cities, inadequate industrial water supply, and liquid&#13;
and solid waste disposal are serious problems. To meet GOI's service and equity objectives, more&#13;
investment is needed in local or tertiary systems in poorly served urban areas. The Bank's 1993&#13;
Urban Public Infrastructure Services Report (No. 12154-IND) estimated that the 1990&#13;
infrastructure investment backlog was at least some US$5 billion for the main five subsectors&#13;
(piped water, sanitation, solid waste, urban roads, and drainage). Further, a substantial backlog&#13;
prevails in the maintenance of facilities, which has resulted in decreased productivity of previous&#13;
infrastructure investments.&#13;
1.9          Sector Finances. Finances of provincial and local governments have long been&#13;
dominated by central government transfers and are characterized by weak local resource&#13;
mobilization, low per-capita budgets and limited use of credit for capital investment. The&#13;
traditionally dominant role played by GOI central government financing of local government&#13;
infrastructure is partly due to the GOI unitary system which limits local authority for levying&#13;
taxes. Grants and other revenue sharing mechanisms used by GOI are intended to resolve the&#13;
disparity between increasingly decentralized service responsibilities and local resource&#13;
mobilization. Although grant allocation criteria have been modified to respond better to local&#13;
needs and shortfalls (compared to minimum standards), there is a need to more closely relate&#13;
grant allocations to local performance and economic productivity requirements.&#13;
1.10        Local governments are required by MHIA to prepare and implement Revenue&#13;
Improvement Action Plans (RIAPs) to improve revenues under their own administration. While&#13;
this has improved the situation in many local governments including those in East Java, there is&#13;
still much room for further local revenue growth. Restructuring of central-local government&#13;
financial relationships and improved fiscal capacities for local governments in Indonesia are topics&#13;
of on-going policy dialogue which are gaining increased urgency as growth in urban services&#13;
requirements outpaces local capacities to respond. The larger infrastructure projects are still&#13;
often financed directly from the national budget (APBN/DIP) and are executed by the regional&#13;
offices of central government agencies (Kanwil) for subsequent transfer to the local government.&#13;
However, these projects frequently lead to land acquisition and/or operations and maintenance&#13;
(O&amp;M) obligations which the local governments are not fully capable of undertaking or&#13;
sustaining. Local government borrowing capacities are generally quite limited and incentives to&#13;
borrow are weak in the current financing pattern, although some capable local government are&#13;
willing to accelerate their development program by borrowing.&#13;
1.11        Urban Infrastructure Issues.  The main problems and issues faced by all&#13;
Indonesian urban areas are: (a) serious infrastructure deficiencies and O&amp;M backlogs; (b) lack of&#13;
coordination in integrating infrastructure investments with land management and transport&#13;
objectives; (c) no administrative status for urban areas, other than the largest cities (Kotamadya);&#13;
(d) weak management of water enterprises; (e) poor financial management system including&#13;
deficient accounting practices, the lack of adequate cost recovery, weak revenue generation, and&#13;
little use of credit, as well as poor information systems; (f) inefficient programming of the design&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
and construction cycles, often compressed into single fiscal years; (g) complex relationships&#13;
among local, provincial and central agencies with respect to responsibilities for project and&#13;
program preparation, appraisal, financing, implementation, and O&amp;M; and (h) shortage of trained&#13;
and experienced managerial and technical personnel at all levels.&#13;
B. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY&#13;
1.12         UIUDP Approach. With large deficiencies in urban infrastructure and a fast-&#13;
growing urban population, GOI's strategy in the past has emphasized physical infrastructure&#13;
targets: length of roads to be built, percentage of population to be supplied with piped water,&#13;
sanitation services, etc.  These targets have a prominent place in the five year national&#13;
development plans (REPELITAs). In 1987, GOI issued a statement of urban policies,&#13;
representing a consolidated view of development in the sector. This Policy Statement for Urban&#13;
Development, incorporated in REPELITA V (for the period 1989-94) includes: (a) strengthening&#13;
local governments to build, operate and maintain local services; (b) improving the planning and&#13;
programming of urban infrastructure investments; (c) mobilization of local revenues and the&#13;
optimization of their use; and (d) strengthening consultative processes at various levels of&#13;
government, particularly the participation of municipalities and regencies.&#13;
1.13        GOI's Policy Statement called for Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development&#13;
Programs (IUMDP) as the operational approach for achieving the above objectives. The policy&#13;
was translated into action plans for local institutional strengthening (Local Institutional&#13;
Development Action Plan or LIDAP) and improvements in local resource mobilization (RIAP),&#13;
sector programming, and financing arrangements. GOI has also provided (with domestic funds)&#13;
further support to the reform effort of the local government revenue departments (DISPENDA),&#13;
initiated under . the Fifth Urban Project (Loan 2408-IND).  In the current five-year plan&#13;
(REPELITA VI), GOI has continued to develop the LUIDP process to emphasize the following&#13;
priorities: (a) expanding the scope of the IUMDP process to include additional subsectors which&#13;
are important in promoting the economic development of cities; (b) strengthening local&#13;
government institutional capabilities; (c) improving O&amp;M of urban infrastructure; (d) improving&#13;
cost recovery and implementation of a more fully integrated system for the financing of urban&#13;
infrastructure services; and (e) increasing attention to urban land and environmental management.&#13;
GOI is also encouraging experimentation by local governments with various mechanisms for&#13;
private sector participation in urban services delivery.&#13;
1.14        GOI also issued regulations and policy clarifications to operationalize urban sector&#13;
policy and the IUIDP approach; with World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and bilateral&#13;
assistance, GOI created a nation-wide program for IUIDP preparation and implementation&#13;
beginning in 1987; and UNDP/UNCHS and the Bank supported a central assistance team to the&#13;
IUIDP process led by TKPP at BAPPENAS. To date more than 75 percent of local governments&#13;
have completed IUIDP program preparation and initiated implementation.&#13;
1.15        Local Borrowing. Under REPELITA V, GOI also gave priority to the expansion&#13;
of borrowing by local governments and their water enterprises (PDAMs). To induce a higher&#13;
level of credit financing, GOI adopted less conservative financial criteria for borrowing by local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
entities (debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 for local government general fuind&#13;
operations and not less than 1.3 for local enterprises such as PDAMs). This has brought the legal&#13;
borrowing capacity of local governments, particularly the larger municipalities, more in line with&#13;
their considerably underutilized financial capacity. There is, nevertheless, a natural preference for&#13;
grant financing on the part of local governments, especially for investments that do not directly&#13;
generate revenues through service charges. GOI's intent is to fix medium and long-term interest&#13;
rates for local governments and their enterprises at a level approximating market rates for&#13;
development borrowings, but suitable reference rates reflecting market conditions for long-term&#13;
borrowing are only now emerging from recent public sector bond sales. The Ministry of Finance&#13;
sets fixed rates for local government borrowings each year for loans initiated during that year; for&#13;
the past two years the rate has been 11.75% which has been positive in real terms and generally&#13;
approximates market borrowing costs.&#13;
1.16        REPELITA VI. REPELITA VI and the second 25 Year National Development&#13;
Plan, both of which started in April 1994, emphasize sustainable urban development through&#13;
improvement in the quality of the living environment, support for economic growth, reduction in&#13;
regional development disparities, and povertyalleviation. Perhaps the most significant change&#13;
reflected in REPELITA VI is to shift the focus of GOI urban programs from overcoming current&#13;
service deficits to a more forward-looking emphasis on the investments needed to realize the&#13;
economic potential of urban areas, including their functions as service centers for regional&#13;
development. While continuing the basic premises of REPELITA V and the National Policy&#13;
Statement for Urban Development mentioned above, REPELITA VI takes a more strategic&#13;
approach by expanding the IUIDP into an Integrated Urban Development Program (IUDP) that&#13;
includes: (a) a larger number of smaller cities and towns; (b) broader spatial planning and urban&#13;
planning in addition to public works infrastructure development plans; (c) expanding the scope of&#13;
the Kampung Improvement Program (KIP) to cover low income and rental housing, infrastructure&#13;
provision for low-income areas, and urban renewal; (d) involving the private sector and&#13;
communities to a greater extent; and (e) strengthening environmental sustainability. To accelerate&#13;
decentralization and implementation of plans, emphasis is being placed on better use of resources,&#13;
mobilization of local revenues, developing financing mechanisms, and increasing cost recovery by&#13;
municipalities and their agencies. Better coordination and strengthening of local agencies is also&#13;
being sought. Financing policies for urban services emphasize local government revenue&#13;
improvement as well as greater efficiency in the deployment of the revenues, and increased use of&#13;
the central government lending and special urban grant mechanisms as the means of financing&#13;
urban development under local management.&#13;
1.17        Environment and Resettlement. In 1993, GOI enacted Government Regulation&#13;
51/93 on environmental impact assessment, mitigation and monitoring measures, and Presidential&#13;
Decree (KEPRES) 55/93 on land acquisition for the development of public facilities, to improve&#13;
on earlier decrees and their application. Government Regulation 51/93 makes refinements to&#13;
GOI's environmental assessment procedures, which are now substantially consistent with Bank&#13;
policies and best practices under Bank-financed projects. Implementing regulations for KEPRES&#13;
55/95 (Operational Directive 1/94 by the National Land Agency - BPN ) were issued in June 1994&#13;
and implementation of these improved procedures is currently underway. KEPRES 55/93 and&#13;
BPN-OD 1/94 seek to ensure persons affected by project land acquisition have adequate access to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
information, fair negotiations, compensation packages based on market values, and grievance&#13;
procedures. However, there are still some policy matters, primarily in the areas of entitlement&#13;
eligibility, compensation calculations and funding sources, where there is some divergence from&#13;
Bank's Operational Directive regarding involuntary resettlement (OD 4.30).  One of the&#13;
institutional capacity building tasks of the project will be to assist East Java province and the local&#13;
governments to fully comply with GOI and related Bank requirements for environment and&#13;
resettlement issues (see paras. 5.30-5.35).&#13;
II. BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE&#13;
2.1         Overall Sector Experience. The Bank has been involved in the urban water&#13;
supply sector since the 1960s, with relatively little change in approach. While many projects have&#13;
provided substantial economic and health benefits, the experience indicates: (a) supply of water&#13;
has lagged behind increasing demand; (b) delays in project implementation are common; (c)&#13;
improving institutions and achieving cost-recovery have been slow, difficult and neglected; (d)&#13;
water quality is a persistent problem; and (e) disposal of waste water in densely populated areas&#13;
has been difficult.&#13;
2.2         Bank involvement in the urban sector started in the early 1970s with low cost&#13;
investment projects in shelter, water supply, sanitation, and urban transport, aimed at alleviating&#13;
urban poverty. Sites and services and slum upgrading projects were to demonstrate replicable&#13;
approaches benefiting the poor, while recovering costs and reducing the financial burden on the&#13;
public sector. Many of these projects succeeded in physical terms, but had little impact on the&#13;
policies of national and local governments and on urban management. The Bank had not paid&#13;
adequate attention to the policy and institutional requirements for improving the productivity of&#13;
the urban economy and reducing urban poverty, and improving management of the urban&#13;
environment. Further, as many of the urban programs did not achieve sustainable policy reform&#13;
and institutional development, project approaches were generally not replicable outside the&#13;
framework of Bank financial support.&#13;
2.3         By the mid-1980s the experience of donor-assisted projects had led to shifts in&#13;
approaches to the urban sector. It was recognized that central governments alone were unable to&#13;
meet the increasing needs for infrastructure services of rapidly growing urban populations and&#13;
greater efforts had to be devoted to: (a) improving the management capability of urban&#13;
institutions and inter-governmental fiscal relations; (b) improving local resource mobilization; (c)&#13;
enhancing the management and quality of urban infrastructure, particularly with regard to&#13;
maintenance; (d) establishing enabling rather than constraining regulatory frameworks; (e)&#13;
expanding financial services for urban development; and (f) promoting private sector participation&#13;
in urban service delivery. Recent initiatives by governments and donors in these areas reflect a&#13;
growing appreciation of the importance of policies, institutions, and regulations in formulating&#13;
effective strategies to manage urban growth.&#13;
2.4         Experience in Indonesia.  The Bank has financed 13 completed and eight&#13;
ongoing urban and water supply projects in Indonesia since 1974, for more than sixty local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
governments and many of their water enterprises (see Annex 1). Urban lending operations in&#13;
Indonesia have progressed from demonstration projects in Jakarta through more programmatic&#13;
investments in selected other large cities, to sector lending within an agreed policy and&#13;
institutional framework (although still limited in terms of area and subsectoral scope). Water&#13;
supply projects initially covered only a few cities at a time, but later, like Bank projects in other&#13;
countries, assisted a large number of urban settlements under one operation. Details concerming&#13;
Bank-funded water and urban infrastructure projects are available from a study carried out by the&#13;
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in September 1995 entitled, 'Indonesia: Impact&#13;
Evaluation Report, Enhancing the Quality of Life in Urban Indonesia - The Legacy of Kampung&#13;
Improvement Program" (Report no. 14747-IND). In urban transport projects, or the transport&#13;
components of urban development projects, attention has focused on road construction and traffic&#13;
management and maintenance. Even so, implementation of road schemes has been slower than&#13;
expected, and quality of construction has frequently been the cause of reduced facility lifespan.&#13;
Inadequate attention was given to improvement of public transport services and facilities for non-&#13;
motorized vehicles or pedestrians.&#13;
2.5         Bank experience confirms that: (a) limited planning and implementation capacities&#13;
at the central government level, and the difficulties inherent in providing essentially local services&#13;
by central government departments, reduce the efficiency of mass delivery programs; (b) capacity&#13;
building at the local level is a long-term process that needs to be accompanied by structural and&#13;
institutional strengthening to achieve an increase in local responsibility and accountability; and (c)&#13;
to develop such responsibility and accountability, central-local financial relations need to provide&#13;
more local government autonomy and enable private sector involvement. Furthermore, the OED&#13;
study cited above concluded that under conditions of rapid economic development, targeted urban&#13;
sector improvement programs can have a very positive impact on low-income areas, and that&#13;
those impacts can be achieved at a low cost of investment that reaps high economic rates of&#13;
return. The mid-term review of the East Java-Bali Urban Development Project (EJBUDP - Loan&#13;
3304-IND) carried out in February 1994 supports this conclusion (see Annex 2). The proposed&#13;
project design takes into account these lessons. Significant responsibility in subproject selection&#13;
and implementation will be handled by the local governments and their water enterprises with&#13;
provincial support in the proposed programmatic approach to this project; suitable assistance in&#13;
project management, local revenue administration, and improvements in operations and&#13;
maintenance will be provided; and management advisory services will be provided to the water&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
2.6         Bank Sector Strategy. The Bank has oriented its overall sector lending to assist&#13;
the Government to deliver adequate urban infrastructure services in cost-effective ways. GOI and&#13;
the Bank emphasize improvements in: (a) service levels, particularly for lower income groups; (b)&#13;
urban productivity and the effectiveness of investments through better infrastructure planning and&#13;
programming, especially at the city level, (c) enhanced local government capacity for fiscal&#13;
management, revenue mobilization, project implementation and O&amp;M; (d) the urban environment&#13;
by enhancing local government capacity to plan, build and operate infrastructure in an&#13;
environmentally sound fashion; and (e) by enhanced community participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
2.7         In promoting efficient urban development, the Bank's strategy supports the&#13;
expanded IUDP approach; however, implementation should include both sectoral and integrated&#13;
approaches as appropriate. While all plans should be integrated, in some cases, implementation&#13;
could be handled through separate sectoral projects. For example, in smaller municipalities&#13;
multisectoral projects are generally of manageable size and complexity; an integrated investment&#13;
approach would, therefore, be more appropriate. In other cases, where the requirements of a&#13;
particular sector are sufficiently large and complex, both in technical terms as well as on policy,&#13;
institutional and financial matters, sectoral projects within the framework of an integrated plan&#13;
may be better suited to implementation capacities.&#13;
2.8         The Bank's urban development financing strategy in Indonesia emphasizes&#13;
increased local resource mobilization through the improvement and efficient deployment of local&#13;
government and water enterprise own-source revenues, including appropriate use of the enhanced&#13;
borrowing capacities which will arise as a consequence of the improvements in revenue. Even&#13;
with such improvements, however, the capacities of the local institutions to contribute to the&#13;
financing of the extensive urban infrastructure deficiencies will in most cases remain limited for&#13;
the foreseeable future, occasioning a continuing need for supplementary special assistance from&#13;
the central government in the form of non-repayable financing contributions. Recognizing the&#13;
need for such special assistance to be structured so as to provide an incentive for the mobilization&#13;
of improved local revenues into the urban infrastructure sectors, as well as to promote the&#13;
objective of decentralization of responsibilities to the local level, the Bank supports the provision&#13;
of assistance in the form of financial investment grants which complement local revenues and&#13;
borrowing contributions on a matching principle, with the implementation of the grants being&#13;
managed by the local institutions. In all these respects the Bank's strategy is fully in accord with&#13;
the policies enunciated in REPELITA VI.&#13;
2.9         The Bank's strategy also promotes establishing an enabling regulatory and planning&#13;
framework for urban land management. A key focus of the Bank's strategy will be to support&#13;
G0I efforts to establish an effective land management system and simplify other regulations to&#13;
facilitate more efficient and environmentally sound urban land use and strengthen land tenure.&#13;
The Bank is also assisting the Government to develop improved implementation frameworks for&#13;
addressing environmental and social impacts of urban projects.&#13;
2.10        Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's 1995 Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS) for Indonesia discussed in March 1995 highlights the need for improving public service&#13;
delivery in the economy and to the poor in particular, greater decentralization of responsibilities,&#13;
and improved environmental management. In the urban sector, the Bank therefore supports the&#13;
integrated urban development concept and enhancing coordination of planning, implementation&#13;
and supervision among all levels of government, in order to improve the delivery of urban services&#13;
and enable local governments to assume greater responsibility for urban management. The&#13;
proposed project would help GOI meet these needs in the second most populous province of&#13;
Indonesia by emphasizing: the decentralization of responsibility for project management and&#13;
implementation; the integration of environmental considerations in urban development&#13;
management; the strengthening of local government institutions and human resources for urban&#13;
management; the improved access to services, priced at an affordable level to lower income&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
groups and under-serviced areas, as well as new development areas; community participation in&#13;
urban investment programs; and the generation of resources for infrastructure investment. The&#13;
thrust of the project is also consistent with the poverty alleviation and environmental improvement&#13;
objectives of the CAS as the project includes targeted interventions designed to improve the&#13;
standard of living and the quality of the environment in the poorer kampung areas of the city of&#13;
Malang and smaller urban areas throughout the province.&#13;
2.11        During the past two decades, the Bank has provided critical support and strategic&#13;
input to the evolving GOI urban policy agenda. With its tradition of administrative competence&#13;
and its diversity of local conditions, East Java has served as an appropriate venue for Bank-GOI&#13;
urban collaboration during this entire period, from early urban projects in Surabaya and two&#13;
provincial-scale water supply projects to the integrated program concepts now being&#13;
implemented.  The ongoing EJBUDP represents a radical departure from  previous urban&#13;
operations in an attempt to operationalize Bank support to implementing the GOI urban policy.&#13;
The EJBUDP pioneered approaches to decentralized Bank operation in Indonesia, including the&#13;
utilization of provincial capacities for intermediation and the programmatic application of&#13;
environmental assessment procedures. As documented by the mid-term review of EJBUDP in&#13;
1994 (see Annex 2 for summary), the remarkable success of East Java and Bali provincial and&#13;
local governments in preparing and implementing local integrated programs has established the&#13;
basis for further development of this decentralized model. The proposed operation provides an&#13;
opportunity for GOI and the Bank to address some of the remaining local services deficits and&#13;
issues identified in the mid-term review, while preparing a more strategic regional approach to&#13;
urban infrastructure and services provision, as called for in the GOI REPELITA VI and Second&#13;
25-Year Plan. The Bank's continued participation in the refinement of GOI urban strategy is a&#13;
cornerstone of the Bank's CAS and is essential to its success.&#13;

3.1         Population.  With over 32.5 million people in 1990, East Java province has a&#13;
larger population than Central Java and Yogyakarta combined, with only West Java province&#13;
having a larger population. The average population growth rate during the 1980s was 1.1%&#13;
annually, the lowest among Indonesia's provinces. This low total growth, however, conceals the&#13;
fact that East Java is a rapidly urbanizing province with the urban population growing at an&#13;
average annual rate of 4.5% during the 1980s. By 1990 East Java's urban population had reached&#13;
some 9 million, about 27.4% of the total population. The capital of East Java, Surabaya, is the&#13;
second largest city in Indonesia, with a population of over 3.5 million in 1990. The province has&#13;
three other large cities (i.e., Malang, Kediri, and Jember) of more than 250,000 inhabitants in&#13;
1990, as well as five additional incorporated cities and six unincorporated towns with urban&#13;
populations between 100,000 and 200,000. Perhaps most significantly, there are more than 100&#13;
unincorporated towns in East Java with populations ranging from 10,000 to more than 100,000&#13;
(see Annex 3 for list of towns and cities), nearly all of which are growing more rapidly than the&#13;
provincial total population. This urban growth is being driven by several factors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
3.2          First, the composition of East Java's regional economy experienced a structural&#13;
shift during the 1970s and 1980s. The share of Gross Regional Products (GRP) contributed by&#13;
agriculture declined from some 50% in 1971 to less than 30% in 1987, and the industrial sector&#13;
(mining and quarrying, manufacturing, utilities, and construction) increased from about 14% to&#13;
nearly 24% over the same period, most of the change occurring after 1983. There was also an&#13;
increase in the services sector, mainly in the trade and transport sectors, from 36% to some 47%.&#13;
Moderate but sustained rates of growth were achieved in all the three sectors, agriculture&#13;
averaging 3.5% per year during 1983 to 1987, manufacturing 7.2%, and services 6.4%. This&#13;
balanced diversification of economic activities is what distinguishes East Java from other&#13;
provinces and is the major stimulant to East Java's development. Incomplete data from more&#13;
recent years suggest that these trends are continuing, even accelerating with nearly all growth&#13;
focused in urban areas. It is clear that East Java will be a focal point in the transition of&#13;
Indonesia's economy during the coming years.&#13;
3.3          Second, along with the shift of the regional economy, the central core region of the&#13;
province, bounded by Surabaya, Malang, Kediri, Pasuruan and Probolinggo, which has long been&#13;
a highly-productive plantation area for sugar cane and an extremely fertile rice-growing region,&#13;
became a center of manufacturing industry growth. This uniquely productive area contributes an&#13;
unusually high share of Indonesia's tax revenues. The poorest parts of the province are found on&#13;
the island of Madura, in the four southwestern regencies in the remote and relatively isolated&#13;
limestone hills (Pacitan, Ponorogo, Trenggalek, and Tulungagung) and in the northwestern&#13;
districts of Bojonegoro and Tuban along the Solo River valley. There is limited agriculture&#13;
potential in these areas due to water shortages or periodic flooding, and there is little prospect of&#13;
developing manufacturing industries on any significant scale because of locational disadvantages.&#13;
People therefore are moving out of these areas to the core urban region in search of employment&#13;
opportunities and higher income. Thus, East Java is urbanizing rapidly, and in combination with&#13;
the economic transition noted above, must aggressively prepare for faster urban growth while&#13;
protecting its unique natural resources and agricultural productivity.&#13;
3.4         Urban Services. Despite the initial efforts made under the EJBUDP and other&#13;
previous projects, the continuing rapid urban growth has exerted heavy pressures upon urban&#13;
infrastructure and there are significant backlogs in the provision of urban infrastructure services.&#13;
For example, in the water supply subsector, piped water connection coverage is typically low and&#13;
almost all existing distribution and connection pipes are cracked and leaking, causing water&#13;
contamination and large water losses. In the urban road transport subsector, some 7,000 km of&#13;
roads are in a state of serious deterioration. There is no integrated major road network and traffic&#13;
is congested on major roads and in business centers. In the solid waste management subsector,&#13;
less than half of the solid waste is being collected. Collection and treatment equipment falls short&#13;
of fast growing demand and access roads to waste disposal sites are also inadequate. In the&#13;
human waste/sanitation subsector, facilities and collection equipment are inadequate and&#13;
desludging volume is less than 20% of the volume produced. In the drainage/flood control&#13;
subsector, poor maintenance, insufficient capacity, and inappropriate designs lead to flooding&#13;
problems in many low lying areas and along river banks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
3.5         Lack of adequate basic urban infrastructure services hurts the poor most because it&#13;
is primarily they who do not have access to clean and affordable water and waste disposal&#13;
facilities, and who usually live in low-lying areas that are often affected by flooding. Income&#13;
disparities between the richest and the poorest groups in East Java are still wide by Indonesia&#13;
standards. The Bank's 1993 analysis of poverty in Indonesia showed that East Java has the largest&#13;
number of residents in poverty of any province. In addition, East Java's urban poor were found&#13;
to have the largest 'poverty gap" to overcome among those provinces with significant urban&#13;
populations.&#13;
3.6         Insufficient urban infrastructure services also restrain East Java's industrial sector&#13;
from fully realizing its potential. East Java has the second largest industrial complex in Indonesia&#13;
in terms of employment and establishments, and it contributes at least 21.5% of the national value&#13;
added by manufacturing. East Java also produces the highest non-oil gross domestic product&#13;
among all the provinces. However, inadequate infrastructure services make the industrial&#13;
production and distribution inefficient and frustrate foreign capital investments. In 1994 several&#13;
hundred approved foreign investment applications, which were expected to provide the needed&#13;
impetus to the regional economic development, failed to materialize at least in part because of the&#13;
infrastructure deficiencies, primarily in water supply, transport and waste disposal.&#13;
3.7         Utilizing the data and forecasts of economic activity in East Java presented in the&#13;
recent Bank report: 'Indonesia: Environment and Development: A World Bank Country Study',&#13;
Figure 3.1 on the following page graphically displays the potential environmental problems to be&#13;
faced by East Java provincial and local governments without an aggressive effort to develop&#13;
public and private infrastructure and institutional capacities, particularly environmental and natural&#13;
resource management capacities. The provincial government has recognized the implications of&#13;
economic growth for its natural resources and related land and water-dependent activities, and has&#13;
initiated efforts to strengthen regional management and regulatory frameworks, as noted in the&#13;
following section. The recent rates of conversion of farmland to urban uses, together with recent&#13;
water shortages and pollution problems with both water and air attest to the urgency of these&#13;
issues in East Java, and the high priority of efforts to articulate a regional development strategy.&#13;
B. STRATEGIC PLANNING AND PROGRAMMING&#13;
3.8         Both East Java Province and the city of Malang have recently prepared updated&#13;
spatial plans and development strategy documents. The City of Malang program focuses on the&#13;
city's role as a center of higher education and its potential as a tourism and retirement center.&#13;
The provincial plan emphasizes the industrial development potential of the north coast area and&#13;
the corridor fi am Surabaya to Malang. The potential for utilizing the regional cultural heritage as&#13;
the impetus for a strengthened tourism industry is also evaluated, but not developed in detail.&#13;
Further work is needed to define the policy framework required to realize the regional&#13;
development potential; this will be the focus of the efforts to prepare the proposed East Java&#13;
Strategic Regional Development Program (EJUDP 3).&#13;
3.9          Further, there is now widespread recognition by provincial and local officials that:&#13;
(a) the IUIDP process used to date is too focused on alleviating current services deficits, rather&#13;

than looking toward realizing economic potential; (b) the traditional spatial planning and&#13;
implementation tools available to provincial and local governments do not address many of the&#13;
critical issues now facing the region, nor are appropriate roles for private sector and public&#13;
participation provided in current procedures; (c) recent GOI attempts to streamline foreign&#13;
investment approvals have further undermined the provincial-local roles in spatial and&#13;
environmental management, and (d) the responsibilities for financing and managing the provision&#13;
of services remains unclear in many aspects, particularly regional-scale facilities serving key&#13;
economic activities and protecting public health/environmental quality.&#13;
3.10        GOI and East Java province have thus requested Bank support to prepare a further&#13;
operation, an East Java Strategic Regional Development Program which would define an&#13;
urban/regional investment and management strategy for implementation beginning with&#13;
REPELITA VII (1999-2004), to include at least the following major components:&#13;
-     Analysis of Regional Economic Potential and Strategy Development Options&#13;
-     Water Resources Management Strategy for Brantas River and Solo River Basins&#13;
-     Regional Transportation System Development Program&#13;
-     Cultural Assets Protection Program and Tourism Development Strategy&#13;
-     Spatial Structure Plans at Provincial and Local Levels (including programs for&#13;
protection of agricultural production capacity)&#13;
-     Development of Simplified Land Use Controls and Spatial Management Tools&#13;
-     Framework for Private Sector and Public Participation&#13;
-     Review and Clarification of Central-Local Financing and Management&#13;
Responsibilities for Infrastructure and Public Services&#13;
-     Medium-Term Capital Investment Budgets and O&amp;M Programs for all Units&#13;
-     Urban Policy Action Plan (UPAP) for East Java, related to GOI UPAP with&#13;
emphasis on necessary institutional capacity-building.&#13;
3.11        The East Java Provincial Development Planning Agency (BAPPEDA I) proposes&#13;
to lead this ambitious effort to prepare coordinated regional and local development plans, in close&#13;
coordination with BAPPENAS and other involved central agencies. In much the same fashion as&#13;
the EJBUDP preparation provided a practical forum for Bank-GOI dialogue to operationalize the&#13;
1987 Urban Policy Statement, the proposed elements of the East Java Strategic Regional&#13;
Development Program will provide opportunities to design creative responses to the critical&#13;
urban/regional development challenges currently faced by East Java and most other urban areas of&#13;
Indonesia. It is GOI's stated intent to seek broad involvement of the donor community in&#13;
developing this strategic approach and building support for its implementation, with the Bank&#13;
providing overall guidance and assistance in coordinating this complex process. Arrangements&#13;
for initiating the input studies and coordination mechanisms, including the pending request for a&#13;
PHRD-Japan Grant to finance design and initiate preparation of the proposed subsequent&#13;
project, will be discussed during negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORIGIN AND FORMULATION&#13;
4.1         The proposed Second East Java Urban Development Project is requested by GOI&#13;
and East Java Province as an extension of the current East Java-Bali Urban Development Project&#13;
(EJBUDP). The Bank completed a mid-term review of the current project in June 1994 (see&#13;
summary in Annex 2) and agreed with GOI to a reallocation of loan funds which essentially&#13;
completed the commitment of the loan ($180.3 million) during the GOI fiscal year 1994-95,&#13;
ended March 31, 1995. Completion of major civil works and institutional strengthening&#13;
assis.ance, with minor additional new works will carry the current project through GOI FY 95-96.&#13;
The proposed project would provide a continuation of the modest and generally successful efforts&#13;
of 'Cast Java local governments to overcome current infrastructure and services deficits. The&#13;
significance of continuing urban project momentum in East Java can, in fact, be understood by&#13;
: eviewing the strategic nature and results to date of the current project.&#13;
4.2         The EJBUDP has been mutually regarded by GOI and the Bank from the outset of&#13;
project identification in 1987 as a 'pilot" or 'hew model" for urban infrastructure and local&#13;
services delivery programs, intended to give operational reality to the GOI Urban Policy&#13;
Statement adopted in 1987, underpinning the Urban Sector Loan (2616-IND). The EJBUDP&#13;
program reflects the six key priority areas of the GOI Urban Policy Statement and the related&#13;
Policy Action Plan, which was being implemented in parallel with the preparation of EJBUDP,&#13;
and which GOI recently reconfirmed and extended as the basis for policy actions in the current&#13;
GOI five-year development plan (REPELITA VI). The six policy themes were:&#13;
(a)   Decentralization of urban services delivery responsibilities to local governments&#13;
(kabupatens/kotamadyas), as their capacities permit;&#13;
(b)   Preparation and implementation of local urban improvement programs with the&#13;
framework of the GOI Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development Program&#13;
(IUIDP), defined to include physical infrastructure investment and O&amp;M for public&#13;
works sub-sectors and programs;&#13;
(c)   Development of local government institutional capacities to manage and sustain&#13;
urban services delivery systems to rapidly growing urban populations:&#13;
(d)   Strengthening of local government capacities to mobilize resources and optimize&#13;
the use of funds under their control;&#13;
(e)   Improvement in the framework for coordination and consultation among the&#13;
involved agencies (i) new/revised mechanisms for local government borrowing and&#13;
(ii) improved criteria for allocation of grants; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
(f)   Rationalizing the procedures for coordination and consultation among the involved&#13;
agencies and levels of government (central, provincial, and local) to improve&#13;
communication and facilitate implementation efforts.&#13;
4.3   The preparation of EJBUDP (1988-1990) was extended and somewhat impaired by the&#13;
uneven progress achieved toward implementing the Urban Policy Action Plan, and in several&#13;
important areas it was left to the EJBUDP preparation team to provide an operational definition&#13;
or interpretation of the Policy Statement's implications for urban programs. In this context, the&#13;
EJBUDP incorporates significant departures from previous GOI and Bank urban operations,&#13;
while attempting to build on the positive features of past experience (e.g. KIP). The mid-term&#13;
review focused on the innovative components or major departures from previous projects in&#13;
attempting to assess the development impact of this 'pilot" effort. It must be noted that many of&#13;
the successful innovations/departures developed during EJBUDP have already been replicated in&#13;
other Bank urban projects, as well as projects financed by other donors (particularly ADB).&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.4         The medium-term development objectives of the proposed project are (i) to&#13;
improve urban infrastructure service delivery, and (ii) to develop necessary financial and&#13;
institutional capacity in local governments to sustain urban services; more specific operational&#13;
objectives of the project include:&#13;
(a)   to improve the provision of urban services (roads, water supply, sanitation,&#13;
drainage and solid waste management) to residential communities and economic&#13;
activities throughout East Java in line with the modest service standards targeted&#13;
by REPELITA VI, which gives priority to poor and underserved neighborhoods&#13;
(i.e. reduction of current infrastructure/service deficits);&#13;
(b)   to continue the institutional development assistance provided for local and&#13;
provincial government agencies under the EJBUDP, particularly to strengthen&#13;
local capacities for operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of urban services systems,&#13;
and increase the effectiveness of local resource mobilization and management; and&#13;
(c)   to support GOI and East Java efforts to operationally define the REPELITA VII&#13;
urban/regional development strategy to include environmental management, land&#13;
development controls, and private sector participation in an improved planning and&#13;
infrastructure investment framework for realizing regional development potentials&#13;
by supporting the preparation of an East Java Strategic Regional Development&#13;
Program (FY99S in the lending program).&#13;
4.5         Measuring Progress Toward Project Objectives. The project design further&#13;
refines the successful EJBUDP model of decentralized project implementation and 'bottom-up"&#13;
approach to selection of investment and action priorities, which implies that monitoring of&#13;
implementation progress and impact must be focused at the local government level. However, in&#13;
accordance with both GOI and Bank requirements, project progress reporting must support a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
procedure to evaluate the performance of the project in aggregate toward achieving development&#13;
objectives for the province, including all 36 local governments and 7 subsectors. Given the wide&#13;
variation in current conditions, local capacities and priorities, the project design has been&#13;
structured to support a two-tiered monitoring and evaluation process to include: (a) the continued&#13;
operation and strengthening of comprehensive program management systems in each locality and&#13;
participating PDAM as used in EJBUDP and familiar to local officials (generally measuring&#13;
implementation performance in terms of actual input and output quantities and process milestones&#13;
versus agreed implementation/action plans), and (b) the selection of a few key measures or&#13;
'priority targets" within each local program (PJM) to be used as indicators of outcomes or&#13;
impacts of highest importance in the local context toward attaining project development&#13;
objectives. As in EJBUDP, the provincial compilation of all local project data will allow&#13;
aggregation of project results and provide an overview of total achievements of the project. Both&#13;
tiers of this progress measurement approach are presented in Annex 4.&#13;
4.6         Although the implementation monitoring will focus on local government&#13;
performance, the Province will compile and report the following aggregate measures of overall&#13;
project performance:&#13;
(a)   The percentage of urban households in East Java Province receiving the&#13;
REPELITA VI targeted levels of urban services (baseline data and measurement&#13;
methodology to be developed by East Java Provincial Government with DGCK&#13;
guidance);&#13;
(b)   Number of participating local governments attaining agreed targets for local&#13;
revenue improvement (RIAP), institutional strengthening (LIDAP), and&#13;
operations/maintenance expenditure (POMMS);&#13;
(c)   Percentage attainment of "priority targets" defined in participating local&#13;
government APIP/MPPT documents (see Annex 4); and&#13;
(d)   Conformance with agreed schedule for preparation of East Java Strategic Regional&#13;
Development Program (schedule to be developed before initial annual review of&#13;
project in October 1996).&#13;
4.7         It is proposed that the attainment of the selected 'priority targets" for each locality&#13;
and PDAM be used as the primary indicator of local government performance. Utilizing the local&#13;
'priority targets" as indicators to measure the overall progress of the project toward its&#13;
developiment objectives, however, requires that during the provincial approval of the Annual&#13;
Project Implementation Plan (APIP) for each local jurisdiction (see para. 5.3 and Annex 8),&#13;
mutual agreement be reached on the 5-7 priority targets which best summarize or capture the&#13;
project impacts/outcomes desired in each locality and which will vary widely with the priorities of&#13;
the local PJM and local conditions (e.g. targets may include institutional capacity outcomes,&#13;
O&amp;M performance results for drainage, or key process steps such as site selection for solid waste,&#13;
in addition to key physical infrastructure implementation necessary to produce desired impacts).&#13;
A menu of potential targets, as well as a sample of suggested 'priority targets" for the City of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
Malang, are discussed in Annex 4. Local governments and participating PDAMs attaining priority&#13;
targets will be encouraged to expand/accelerate their programs, while poor performance would&#13;
result in decreased funding until targets are met. During negotiations, agreement was reached&#13;
with GOI on the inclusion of priority targets in each APIP and the use of these targets as&#13;
performance indicators and as evaluation and management tools.&#13;
4.8          Ultimately, the perceptions of civil society regarding the extent to which their&#13;
individual and collective needs or demands for infrastructure and urban services are being met&#13;
must be the measure of program effectiveness. However, the mechanisms for measuring public&#13;
satisfaction or unmet demands are currently crude at best. Subsectoral technical memoranda for&#13;
water supply, sanitation, solid waste, and traffic management, as well as KIP/MIIP programs call&#13;
for obtaining direct public input to subproject design, but contain no provision for feedback on the&#13;
resulting services. Options for expanded surveys and other mechanisms for obtaining inputs from&#13;
civil society will be discussed with GOI and Provincial officials, as well as with local governments,&#13;
during the project launch workshops and subsequent project supervision.&#13;
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.9          This project is designed to provide programmatic assistance to reduce the backlog&#13;
of urban infrastructure investment needs in cities and towns which were not addressed under the&#13;
EJBUDP loan program, and to enable those which were in the EJBUDP to update and extend&#13;
their medium-term (PJM) program. The project will support (a) a three year program of high&#13;
priority infrastructure expenditures and subproject investments in the participating local&#13;
governments and their water enterprises, including all the seven cities/kotamadyas and 29&#13;
regencies/kabupatens in East Java Province serving a total of up to 102 urban areas' (Annex 3&#13;
lists the eligible urban areas in each kabupaten and the seven incorporated cities.); each local&#13;
government's PJM defines subproject investments in roads, water supply, drainage and flood&#13;
control, human waste management, solid waste management, and KIP/MIP as well as provide&#13;
technical assistance needed to support the implementation of the proposed program, (b)&#13;
complementary local institutional development action plans to improve urban management,&#13;
increase the institutional capacity of the implementing agencies, and financial action plans to&#13;
improve local financial management and revenue generation to the local governments, and (c)&#13;
GOI and provincial initiatives to prepare the policy framework and identify the strategic&#13;
investment program of works for the proposed East Java Strategic Regional Development&#13;
Program (EJUDP-3) addressing the economic development potential of cities and towns in East&#13;
Java (See Table 4.1 for project overview).&#13;
At the request of GOI, the proposed loan would primarily support investments programmed in 54 "priority" urban areas&#13;
(including all cities and regency capitals). Other PJM proposals in the 48 non-priority towns would be fmanced entirely&#13;
by domestic funds.&#13;

(a)   Infrastructure Works (Sub-Proiects)&#13;
4.10        The preparation and appraisal of the program proposals and identified sub-projects&#13;
in each local jurisdiction have been completed in accordance with a series of agreed Technical&#13;
Memoranda covering the design and appraisal criteria applicable to sub-projects in each&#13;
subsector. These Technical Memoranda were updated (minimally) from similar documents used&#13;
during EJBUDP preparation and appraisal (see Annex 16 for summary of criteria), with the&#13;
exception of the Human Waste/Sanitation component which the mid-term review found to have&#13;
been ineffective in EJBUDP. Annex 5 provides a summary of the redesigned sanitation&#13;
component for the proposed project.&#13;
4.11        Urban Roads and Traffic Management. The project provides for a program of&#13;
road improvement, and road rehabilitation and maintenance totaling more than 900km, including&#13;
resurfacing as needed, drainage, curb, and sidewalks. Traffic management programs will be&#13;
initiated in a number of major towns in the program. Routine and periodic maintenance needs&#13;
have been identified with the help of consultants, and DGBM/Binkot following accepted&#13;
standards in the road administration. Costs have been based on standard material volume and unit&#13;
rates from previous contracts. Road improvements have been prepared to a preliminary design&#13;
stage, in some cases, detailed designs are available, in accordance with road function and traffic&#13;
volume. Outstanding final design and procurement will be undertaken within the project.&#13;
4.12        Water Supply. Local water enterprises (PDAMs) have been required to prepare&#13;
corporate operating plans (or mini-LIDAPs) to improve efficiency and begin to change the 'bost-&#13;
plus" culture that has prevailed in management of water services. By negotiations, 19 of the 36&#13;
PDAMs in East Java had qualified for inclusion in the proposed project by completing drafts of&#13;
such documents and associated investment proposals; others may be included in the programmatic&#13;
element of the project. The appraised water supply investments consist of increasing service&#13;
connection and reticulation coverage in 32 urban areas in the province, while in at least seven of&#13;
these towns increased water source and treatment quantities will be addressed. In all some&#13;
102,000 new consumers will be connected to the piped and water system in the 32 towns. A total&#13;
of more than 1300km of secondary and tertiary piping will be installed in the cities covered&#13;
providing a more reliable service and better quality water. A program will be undertaken in all the&#13;
cities to address and reduce water losses. Many cities suffer from poor maintenance of an old&#13;
service systems installed during Dutch rule before World War II. The proposed project will&#13;
rehabilitate these systems, replacing significant length of pipe where necessary to provide more&#13;
reliable service to the consumers. Storage reservoirs will be provided in 20 towns to improve&#13;
system capacity and provide better system water pressure. Detailed design and tender package&#13;
preparation has already been completed by the majority of the PDAMs. Outstanding detailed&#13;
design and contract package preparation will be completed during project implementation.&#13;
4.13        Solid Waste Management. The solid waste management component will address&#13;
at least 44 towns and will provide increased collection coverage and develop a number of new&#13;
solid waste disposal sites (TPAs). Procurement of equipment such as bulldozers, dump trucks,&#13;
container, and special container transports, arm roll trucks, compactor trucks and hand carts are&#13;
included in the programs for each town. Two pilot facilities for waste composting will also be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
developed. Solid waste disposal sites will be developed as sanitary landfill sites, and will be&#13;
developed together with sludge disposal plants (IAPT) to handle septic tank effluent in a number&#13;
of locations. Disposal treatment facilities will be installed at each site to treat leachate and runoff&#13;
from the solid waste materials as needed.&#13;
4.14          Human Waste Disposal/Sanitation. The component has been redesigned from&#13;
EJBUDP (see Annex 5) and is intended to improve urban environmental conditions within all&#13;
seven cities and 29 kabupatens throughout East Java in some combination of: (i) adequate&#13;
wastewater and sludge treatment facilities (off-site small bore sewerage/waste water treatment&#13;
plants in seven cities servicing 140,000 people); (ii) approximately 75 organized neighborhood&#13;
communities (kelurahan) participating in the identification, planning, management, and financing&#13;
of appropriate infrastructure investments and subsequent maintenance (sewerage/drainage, septic&#13;
tanks, and 3,980 MCKs and 23 community toilets for off-site sanitation;2 (iii) institutionalized&#13;
mechanisms for financing household/level flush toilet connections; (iv) adequate, targeted,&#13;
community-based, sanitation education in support of (ii) and (iii) above; (v) improved public and&#13;
private sector capacities at local levels (a) to construct and maintain core sanitation infrastructure&#13;
at the aggregate kabupaten/kotamadya level (including 13 sludge removal trucks and four sludge&#13;
disposal plants, (b) to provide managerial, technical and financial assistance to kelurahan in&#13;
support of localized community responsibilities, and (c) to develop and provide appropriate&#13;
sanitation education; and (vi) local regulatory reform. Detailed designs of physical infrastructure&#13;
components will need to be completed during implementation, as discussed in Annex 5.&#13;
4.15          Drainage/Flood  Control.    This  component  includes  rehabilitation  and&#13;
improvement of primary and secondary drainage canals, normalization of river banks and deferred&#13;
and incremental O&amp;M. Final design will incorporate flood control systems, retention basins&#13;
where appropriate, and will review usefulness of hydraulic flood control gates in low lying areas.&#13;
4.16          KIP/MIIP. The project will contribute to improving conditions in poorer quality&#13;
kampungs by 1998. A total of more than 200 kampungs (encompassing approximately 2700 ha)&#13;
will be upgraded through provision of footpaths, drainage, sanitation improvement, water supply,&#13;
road construction and community participation. Market area improvements (MIIP) will also be&#13;
carried out in a number of centers under the detail of the project. Design for both KIP and MIIP&#13;
facilities will be implemented within the project. For descriptive and financing purposes, the&#13;
sanitation element of this component is discussed in para. 4.14 above and Annex 5.&#13;
4.17          Urban Renewal.  The City of Malang has included proposed subprojects to&#13;
improve approximately 10 ha. of riverbank floodplain, and to undertake development of a 10 ha.&#13;
sites and services project, together with a 5 ha. resettlement housing site preparation, in part to&#13;
prepare for anticipated land acquisition/resettlement requirements for major road improvement&#13;
which have been identified but deferred to EJUDP-3 or later. Approximately 6,000 persons&#13;
2   Kelurahan will be eligible to participate by meeting either or both of two criteria: (i) they produce significant&#13;
environmental degradation in other areas of the kabupaten/kotamadya as a result of inadequate sanitation infrastructure&#13;
and/or (ii) the kelurahan is "poor" according to the criteria established for inclusion in the broader KIP/MIIP component&#13;
(see para. 4.16).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
(1,200 families) will be affected, but only a small fraction displaced, by the land readjustment and&#13;
KIP-type infrastructure improvements along the riverbank areas. The proposed sites and services&#13;
project, as well as the resettlement housing site, will be developed on land now owned by the City&#13;
of Malang. A discussion draft of the proposed Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the City of&#13;
Malang proposals has been submitted for Bank review and comments will be discussed during&#13;
negotiations. This draft RAP will be revised in accordance with Resettlement Guidelines being&#13;
prepared for issuance by the Governor of East Java (see para. 5.30). All work on these renewal&#13;
schemes are scheduled for the second and third program years, allowing time for RAP refinement&#13;
and mutual agreement prior to implementation of these subprojects.&#13;
4.18        Detailed Engineering Design (DED) and Construction Supervision. For each&#13;
subproject in each local jurisdiction, estimates have been reviewed and agreed to establish the&#13;
portion of necessary DED and supervision to be performed by local government staff and the&#13;
requirements for supplementing this in-house capacity with consultant services.  Overall,&#13;
approximately one-half of the DED and supervision of project implementation will be performed&#13;
by loral government staff, the balance by local consultants. The cost associated with this&#13;
engineering and supervision effort are included in the component cost estimates (see Annex 6 for&#13;
itemization of these estimates). It is anticipated that the DED and supervision consultants would&#13;
be managed by the provincial Department of Public Works, in similar fashion to the successful&#13;
arrangements for such support under EJBUDP. These consultants would also assist in assuring&#13;
the appropriate incorporation UKLJUPL recommendations from the environmental review&#13;
process into the subproject designs and construction specifications, and support monitoring of&#13;
implementation of the UKL/UPL actions.&#13;
(b)   Institutional Capacity Development&#13;
4.19        The proposed project will also provide technical assistance, advisory support and&#13;
training to local governments and participating PDAMs to strengthen institutional capacities for&#13;
urban management and sustainable services delivery. Advisory teams will be provided to support&#13;
both the Provincial Program Management Office (PPMO) in BAPPEDA I and the Provincial&#13;
Technical Coordination Unit (PTCU) in the Public Works Department, as well as direct technical&#13;
assistance and training to local governments and participating PDAMs from teams based in each&#13;
of the five sub-regions of the province which will focus on the implementation of revenue and&#13;
institutional action plan components of the PJMs (RIAPs and LIDAPs). Continued operation and&#13;
refinement of the program management systems installed in all local governments under EJBUDP&#13;
is another key feature of the component of the project. These systems include:&#13;
the Performance-Oriented Maintenance Management System (POMMS)&#13;
the Project Financial Accounting and Monitoring System (PFAMS)&#13;
the water enterprise financial performance model (modified FINPRO)&#13;
and the conduct of annual financial and technical audits of project implementation activities.&#13;
Additional details of this component are discussed in Section V on Implementation Arrangements&#13;
and the overall technical assistance plan for the project is summarized in Annex 6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
(c)   Preiaration of Strategic DeveloDment Program&#13;
4.20        As summarized in Section III previously, East Java Province intends to prepare a&#13;
revised development policy framework and regional investment plan to enable the realization of&#13;
economic development potential throughout the province, consistent with the Second GOI 25-&#13;
year Development Strategy.  The drafting of a spatial management strategy or 'Strategic&#13;
Structure Plan" with appropriate policy and management tools will be essential to this effort. An&#13;
investment program may then be defined for Bank support in the form of a proposed EJUDP-3&#13;
project, for subsequent implementation during the REPELITA VII (1999-2004). GOI has&#13;
expressed its intention domestically finance the preparation of EJUDP-3 and to seek grant funding&#13;
for at least a portion of the preparation expenses.&#13;
D. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
4.21        Project cost estimates are summarized in Table 4.2, with fiurther details given in&#13;
Annex 7. The total project cost for the three year period 1996/97 to 1998/99 is estimated at Rp.&#13;
552.0 billion, equivalent to US$244.2 million. Base costs, in October 1995 prices, total Rp. 474.4&#13;
billion (US$209.9 million), the balance of the project cost representing contingencies. (Physical&#13;
contingencies average 7.6 percent of investment base costs. Price contingencies reflect current&#13;
Bank estimates of domestic and foreign inflation at 6.0 percent and 2.6 percent respectively.) The&#13;
program for Kotamadya Malang accounts for Rp. 107.3 billion (US$47.5 million) or 19.5 percent&#13;
of the overall project cost. The non-Kotanadya Malang project cost balance of Rp. 444.7 billion&#13;
(US$196.7 million) includes an amount of Rp. 133.1 billion (US$58.9 million) - about 26 percent&#13;
of estimate financing requirements excluding current O&amp;M - for allocation on a programmatic&#13;
basis to supplementary investment subprojects which are likely to be proposed by a number of&#13;
local governments and water enterprises primarily for implementation during the third project&#13;
year. These additional subproject proposals would be summarized in project memoranda and&#13;
presented for subproject approval by the province, as discussed in para. 5.4.&#13;
4.22        Operations and Maintenance Expenditure.  Estimated O&amp;M  expenditure&#13;
accounts for Rp. 200.2 billion (US$88.4 million) or 24.7 percent of the estimated total program&#13;
expenditures, comprising current level O&amp;M of Rp. 140.6 billion (US$62.2 million) which are&#13;
included for monitoring total expenditures but not included in defined 'project costs" and&#13;
incremental O&amp;M of Rp. 59.3 billion (US$26.2 million). The incremental O&amp;M includes Rp.&#13;
44.0 billion (US$19.5 million) relating to existing infrastructure, representing a 31.3 percent&#13;
increase over the current level. This significant increase reflects the need to remedy present&#13;
deficiencies in services quality and address backlogs in physical infrastructure maintenance in the&#13;
water supply, urban roads, drainage and solid waste sectors which have been identified with&#13;
specialist assistance under the performance-orientated maintenance management system&#13;
(POMMS) initiative which was developed under earlier Bank urban projects and introduced into&#13;
East Java local governments and water enterprises under the EJBUDP institutional strengthening&#13;
program.&#13;

E. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
4.23        The Project financing plan is summarized in Table 4.3, with further detail given in&#13;
Annex 7. The proposed Bank Loan of US$142.7 million will provide 39.9 percent of the total&#13;
estimated financing requirement of US$357.3 million (which includes interest and commitment&#13;
fees during construction of an estimated US$14.7 million). This includes an amount of US$30.0&#13;
million reserved for the programmatic subprojects of the project. GOI agencies will finance an&#13;
estimated US$214.1 million, made up of US$132.5 million from local government normal revenue&#13;
sources (locally derived revenues and normal grant entitlements), US$56.5 million from water&#13;
enterprise internal funds, US$11.2 million from the provincial government, and US$13.9 million&#13;
from the central government domestic budget. Community financial contributions, primarily in&#13;
the sanitation subsector, will provide an estimated US$0.5 million. However, as requested by&#13;
GOI, no loan financing of KIP/IMIIP subprojects is proposed, although these subprojects are&#13;
included in the project cost. Subprojects in the non-priority towns are included in the total&#13;
financing requirement for PJM implementation as "other urban investment".&#13;
4.24        Onlending. An estimated US$67.6 million (47 percent) of the total Bank Loan&#13;
will be onlent by the central government to local governments (US$31.9 million) and water&#13;
enterprises (US$35.7 million) under subsidiary loan agreements (SLA).  The sub-loans,&#13;
denominated and repayable in Rupiah, will carry a fixed interest rate of 11.75 percent (the current&#13;
rate fixed by MOF for all borrowings by local government and their enterprises); and a&#13;
commitment fee nominally of 0.75 percent, which will be reduced to the same concessionairy level&#13;
as applies from time to time to the Bank Loan (currently 0.25 percent). The loan periods will be&#13;
consistent with the average economic life of the investments being financed, subject to a&#13;
maximum of 20 years. Grace periods will be allowed equal to the procurement/commissioning&#13;
periods for the investments, subject to a maximum of five years. Local governments will in all&#13;
cases be required to pay interest during the grace periods. The foreign exchange and interest rate&#13;
variation risks will be bome by GOI. For water enterprises, deferment of payment of interest&#13;
during the grace period will be allowed in cases where the financial capacity analysis shows that&#13;
an enterprise cannot afford such interest payment; deferred interest will be compounded and&#13;
added to the loan principal. The Ministry of Fir.ance has established a minimum sub-loan size of&#13;
Rp. 250 million. Agreements on revised standard SLA documents for local governments and&#13;
participating water enterprises were reached during the Loan negotiations.&#13;
4.25        Central Government Budgetary Contributions. The central government will&#13;
budget an estimated Rp. 46.7 billion (US$20.7 million) for the total investment and incremental&#13;
maintenance on infrastructure which is classified as its own responsibility; an estimated Rp. 32.3&#13;
billion (US$14.3 million) of this amount will be financed by the Bank. It will further budget an&#13;
estimated total Rp. 145.9 billion (US$64.6 million) as non-repayable (grant) contributions for the&#13;
finance of Project responsibilities of lower level government institutions. This amount can be&#13;
divided into three elements. The first element, estimated at Rp. 26.6 billion (US$11.8 million)&#13;
represents investments, contract engineering and technical assistance contracts planned to be&#13;
implemented directly by the central government agencies under central sectoral budget allocations&#13;
(DIP); of this amount the Bank would finance an estimated Rp. 18.3 billion (US$8.1 million).&#13;
The second element, estimated at Rp. 36.7 billion (US$16.2 million) represents special grants,&#13;

wholly financed by the Bank, for engineering design and supervision services and technical&#13;
assistance which will be contracted and managed by the provincial government and Kotamadya&#13;
Malang.  The third  element, estimated at Rp. 82.6 billion (US$36.6 million), represents&#13;
supplementary special investment grants to the provincial and local governments for infrastructure&#13;
components which these governments will themselves plan and implement, with counterpart&#13;
financing from their own normal revenues. All these supplementary special grants will be financed&#13;
by the Bank and transferred to lower level agencies by funds channeling letters (known as&#13;
SPABP). However, GOI has expressed a preference for concentrating Bank finance of these&#13;
supplementary special grants on investments in 54 'ttrategic towns", while other urban&#13;
investments will be financed from the domestic budget, subject to affordability to be annually&#13;
determined by BAPPENAS and East Java Province during the national consultation&#13;
(RAKORNAS).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 26 -&#13;
4.26        Finance of Urgent First Year Implementation Preparation.   Contract&#13;
engineering services and selected other technical assistance to a total of US$900,000 needs to be&#13;
committed urgently in order to allow a prompt start to be made on implementing this project in&#13;
1996/97, as outlined in Annex 6. It has been agreed that this will be financed from the provision&#13;
for future project preparation assistance which is included in the Surabaya Urban Development&#13;
Project (Ln. 3726-IND) subject to GOI submission of proposed terms of reference (TOR) and&#13;
procurement documents acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
5.1         The proposed project design is based on substantial further decentralization of&#13;
implementation management responsibilities to East Java Province, as compared to the EJBUDP&#13;
approach. While the MPW Directorate General of Human Settlements will retain the overall&#13;
project oversight role, as the designated central GOI "executing agency", East Java Province will&#13;
have the primary implementation responsibility for the proposed project. This will be the first&#13;
project by the Bank for which a GOI provincial government assumes the implementation&#13;
leadership role. The following paragraphs summarize these arrangements.&#13;
5.2         Provincial Program Implementation Memorandum (PPIM). The Province of&#13;
East Java has been designated by GOI as the principal implementing agency for the proposed&#13;
project. For central GOI operational and technical coordination and oversight, the Directorate&#13;
General for Human Settlements (Cipta Karya) of MPW has been assigned the role of executing&#13;
agency, with the inter-ministerial coordination team for urban development (TKPP) chaired by&#13;
BAPPENAS providing policy guidance and sectoral oversight. As such local leadership&#13;
arrangements have not been previously attempted, except in the metropolitan cities, all parties&#13;
involved have agreed to prepare a "Provincial Program Implementation Memorandum (PPIM)"&#13;
which will document the respective roles, responsibilities and procedures for project&#13;
implementation, in the form of a memorandum of understanding to be signed by the Chairman of&#13;
TKPP, the Director General of Cipta Karya and the Governor of East Java. Annex 11 (a) displays&#13;
a draft outline for the PPIM memorandum. Agreements on a draft of the PPIM and procedures&#13;
for revision or updating during the annual review process were reached during negotiations.&#13;
The final PPIM, acceptable to the Bank, signed by all relevant authorities will be a condition of&#13;
Loan effectiveness.&#13;
5.3         Annual Program Implementation Plan (APIP). Annual Program&#13;
Implementation Plan (APIPs) will be drawn up between East Java Province, the local&#13;
governrnnts participating in the project and their PDAMs to confirm the essential understandings&#13;
and commitments based upon the medium-term expenditure programs (PJMs), financing plans,&#13;
Revenue Improvement Action Plans (RIAPs), Local Institutional Development Action Plans&#13;
(LIDAPs), and sound criteria for land acquisition and resettlement. These will be expressed as&#13;
priority targets and performance indicators for each implementing unit (See Annex 4). Through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
the APIPs, the local governments and their PDAMs would commit themselves to comprehensive&#13;
sectoral investment programs (including O&amp;M budgets), specific revenue targets, and measures to&#13;
strengthen the institutional capabilities for urban management. The investment and sector plans&#13;
will be amnended/updated annually, and a draft presented during the GOlI/Bank Annual Review&#13;
meetings by October of each year to reflect changing conditions during project implementation, as&#13;
provided under the IUDP approach. The local governments (except the City of Malang) will also&#13;
prepare subprojects for financing in the third year of the project and present these as additions to&#13;
their PJMs. All subproject proposals should include an environmental assessment, a management&#13;
and monitoring plan and, if necessary, a resettlement plan prepared in accordance with the&#13;
Resettlement Guidelines. An outline of the APIP is presented in Annex 1 (b). A draft of the&#13;
model APIP, between the provincial government of East Java and participating local&#13;
governments and PDAMs was reviewed at negotiations. Submission of the first APIP,&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, will be a condition of Loan disbursement for subproject civil works and&#13;
goods for each participating local government and PDAM&#13;
5.4         Subproject Approval.  The subproject definition, budgeting and supervision&#13;
arrangements for the implementation of the Project will be summarized for provincial review and&#13;
approval in a set of annual 'Project Memoranda" prepared by each participating local government&#13;
and PDAM. These Project Memoranda (drafts for first year program reviewed at appraisal)&#13;
provide detailed budget proposals for every subproject, covering all concerned institutions at&#13;
every government level (including the water enterprises), showing each contract package,&#13;
necessary O&amp;M  provisions, etc., with the proposed financing sources.  The draft project&#13;
memoranda will form the inputs into the annual budget preparation cycle which commences with&#13;
the local and provincial level consultation meetings known as 'RAKORBANG" through which&#13;
the necessary funding allocations will be secured. Each subproject memorandum will require the&#13;
certification of the provincial government that it conforms with the relevant local government&#13;
appraised program (PJM). Newly identified subprojects for financing under the programmatic&#13;
provisions of the Loan or changes in subproject proposals must be notified to the provincial&#13;
government which will conduct a program reappraisal according to the agreed Project criteria,&#13;
and report approved changes to the Bank. Supporting documentation, including environmental&#13;
impact screening results and RAP documents, where needed, must be attached to each subproject&#13;
memorandum. For those subprojects involving resettlement, the RAP must be submitted for Bank&#13;
approval prior to the start of subproject implementation.&#13;
B. LOCAL IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES&#13;
5.5         During project preparation, each local government was requested to identify&#13;
subprojects, O&amp;M activities and other project actions which could be implemented by the private&#13;
sector. Each PJM now contains provisions for private sector participation, generally limited to&#13;
contracted O&amp;M for solid waste and sanitation, in program implementation. This feature of the&#13;
preparation process has had the intended effects of increasing local government awareness of&#13;
potential private sector roles in urban service provision and initiating a vigorous dialogue at the&#13;
provincial and local levels regarding the policy framework for private sector infrastructure&#13;
provision to be addressed in preparing EJUDP3. This introduces some variation in local&#13;
implementation arrangements.   The MHA  regulations authorizing  somewhat different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
organization and staffing arrangements in local governments based on their population, total area&#13;
and type (city or regency) also introduces some variation in local arrangements; however, each&#13;
PJM contains an implementation plan specific to that local governments, in all cases utilizing the&#13;
existing agencies' structure. In general, these arrangement may be summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)   Operations and Maintenance. A technical team for a Performance-Oriented&#13;
Maintenance Management System (POMMS) has already been established in each&#13;
loeal government to provide technical support (planning, programming, budgeting,&#13;
controlling, evaluating and reporting) to strengthen the O&amp;M program for roads,&#13;
water supply, drainage and solid waste. The project provides for continuing&#13;
consulting support to the POMMS technical team to help identify the needs for&#13;
additional O&amp;M staff, additional equipment and training;&#13;
(b)   Urban Roads and Traffic Management. The Roads and Bridges section of the&#13;
Municipal Public Works Agency (DPUK) is responsible for the construction,&#13;
maintenance and supervision of local roads and bridges. Provincial and national&#13;
roads are the responsibility of the provincial and national governments&#13;
respectively. A separate section will be established in the DPU to implement the&#13;
traffic management program in Malang. Consulting support is being provided&#13;
under the project to design in detail, evaluate and implement individual schemes in&#13;
the traffic management program;&#13;
(c)   Water Supply. The PDAMs will be responsible for construction, operations and&#13;
maintenance the water supply assets generated by the project.  Corporate&#13;
operations plans to improve efficiency and coverages of sewerage are also required&#13;
of each PDAM. Special attention will be given to control unaccounted for water.&#13;
PDAMs are being required to reduce leakage, and maximize utilization of their&#13;
current system, before proposing to increase treatment capacity further.&#13;
Consultant support for implementation of PDAM corporate plans and physical&#13;
improvements is provided in the project design;&#13;
(d)   Drainage and Flood Control. At the municipal level, the drainage sub-section of&#13;
each DPUK has specific responsibility for storm drainage and flood control within&#13;
the municipal area.  Designated major waterways are the responsibility of&#13;
provincial or central Pengairan offices, but all local drainage works must be&#13;
executed by DPUK. O&amp;M performance will be strengthened through POMMS&#13;
and consulting support;&#13;
(e)   Human Waste Disposal. Construction of 'pilot" sewerage schemes in Malang&#13;
and other towns will be carried out with a staff member from the provincial&#13;
Environmental Sanitation Division (Sub-Dinas TPL, Dinas PU Cipta Karya) as&#13;
project Manager on behalf of central DGCK (funding agency). For the longer&#13;
term, consideration will be given to proposals to establish separate sewerage&#13;
enterprises or the addition of sewerage responsibilities to the PDAM charter. The&#13;
on-site sanitation program in all cities will be implemented by the local government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
with the community using municipal staff (BANGDES) as project mangers.&#13;
Sludge collection and disposal services will be provided as much as possible by&#13;
private operators under the supervision of the Cleansing Department (Dinas&#13;
Kebersihan) in each local government (see Annex 5);&#13;
(f)   Solid Waste Management. Dinas Kebersihan in all the municipalities will be&#13;
responsible for all solid waste management activities (Note. In those Kabupatens&#13;
where the cleansing function is a section of DPUK, the local governments will be&#13;
encouraged to establish separate Dinas Kebersihan units.);&#13;
(g)   Infrastructure for Low-income Communities and KIP. DPUK in each local&#13;
government also will be responsible for implementing KIP and other proposed&#13;
poverty components. Consultant services, where needed, providing technical&#13;
assistance on the financial, economic, institutional and environmental aspects, will&#13;
be located in the Dinas; and&#13;
(h)   MIIP. Where available, the market agency in each city (Dinas Pengelola Pasar)&#13;
will be responsible for implementing the MIIEP component of the project. In all&#13;
other cases, implementation will fall directly on the local Dinas PUK.&#13;
C. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
5.6         The proposed project will be implemented over a period of three years,&#13;
commencing with the start of GOI FY1996/97, and will be completed during FY1998/99,&#13;
although the proposed loan documents will provide a brief additional period for completion of any&#13;
delayed work and disbursement up to September 30, 1999. The program of works has been&#13;
designed to commence implementation immediately upon loan effectiveness. Design for the first&#13;
year of all components is virtually completed and the design for the second and third years will be&#13;
completed quickly for timely implementation.&#13;
5.7         Standard tender and contract documents for the various types of packages will be&#13;
prepared prior to Loan effectiveness and discussed with all local implementing agencies during&#13;
project launch workshops, so that implementation can commence during the GOI fiscal year&#13;
beginning April 1, 1996. The PJM for Malang has been prepared as a five-year program of which&#13;
the proposed loan will finance the initial three years of implementation, while other local programs&#13;
have all based preparation initially on a two-year implementation period which has now been&#13;
expanded to the full three years with an allowance for subprojects yet to be identified (primarily&#13;
for implementation in the third program year).&#13;
5.8         Because numerous subprojects will be expected to start immediately after the loan&#13;
is approved, appropriate technical assistance consultant supervision contracts will need to be put&#13;
in place quickly. Terms of Reference for these high priority technical assistance packages have&#13;
already been prepared, and tendering for these services will be commenced immediately. The&#13;
implementation schedule and annual program cycle are graphically summarized in Annex 9.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
D. PROJECT COORDINATION AND MONITORING&#13;
5.9         Provincial Government Responsibilities. The East Java province will play a key&#13;
role in the overall coordination and monitoring of the project, including the management of&#13;
technical assistance. Based on experience in the ongoing EJBUDP, the somewhat complex&#13;
institutional arrangements at the provincial level under that project will be simplified by having a&#13;
single functional organization, the Provincial Project Management Organization (PPMO), in the&#13;
provincial planning agency (BAPPEDA I) for the overall management of the project, including&#13;
programming, coordination and reporting. A key responsibility of the PPMO will be to issue&#13;
guidelines for the preparation of APIPs, to ensure that they are prepared on time, and to finalize&#13;
the APIPs in coordination with the Kanwil/Dinas PU. PPMO will also develop and issue standard&#13;
operating procedures for program implementation. The updated functions and organization of the&#13;
PPMO were defined by a decree of the provincial Governor in September 1995 and further&#13;
operational details will be provided at negotiations. The PPMO will have strong leadership,&#13;
through a full-time Unit manager (Kepala PPMO) and an adequate budget. Technical assistance&#13;
under the project will provide advisory support to the PPMO. Annex 10 displays the revised&#13;
organization structure of the PPMO within the provincial BAPPEDA, as established by a&#13;
Governor's Decree in September 1995 to improve PPMO capacities as compared to that for&#13;
EJBUDP implementation.&#13;
5.10        Technical coordination will be carried out by Dinas PU Cipta Karya, East Java and&#13;
Dinas PU Bina Marga, East Java in their respective areas of responsibility; however, the Kanwil&#13;
PU will coordinate centrally funded sectoral programs. The Secretary to Governor (Sekwilda I)&#13;
will be responsible for overall coordination of implementation. The PPMO will work closely with&#13;
Dinas PU Cipta Karya, Bina Marga, the Sekwilda I, and the Kanwil PU, and these technical&#13;
agencies will designate staff to function as a Program Technical Coordination Unit (PTCU) as&#13;
shown in Annex 10.&#13;
5.11        Local Government Responsibilities. Local governments participating in the&#13;
project will have primary responsibility for project implementation and monitoring of all project-&#13;
related activities in their jurisdiction. A Coordination Team (Tim Koordinasi) will be maintained&#13;
from EJBUDP or established in each participating local government, with the Bupati/Walikota as&#13;
the chair and the heads of all departments involved as members. Programming and planning&#13;
functions will be under the overall charge of the local planning agency (BAPPEDA II), in the&#13;
section for physical infrastructure (Bidang Prasarana Fisik). A local project coordinator, typically&#13;
in the Sekwilda II office, will be appointed for day-to-day activities, and will be provided with an&#13;
adequate budget; the appointment of a project coordinator will be confirmed in the APIP. Line&#13;
agencies (both local and deconcentrated units of central agencies, as appropriate) will be&#13;
responsible for implementing their designated subproject components. Consistent with Indonesian&#13;
government practice, each implementing agency will appoint subproject managers (PIMPROs)&#13;
with an appropriate supervision budgets.&#13;
5.12        The Secretary to the Bupati/Walikota (Sekwilda II) will have overall responsibility&#13;
for coordinating and reporting on all project-related activities (whether handled by the local&#13;
government agencies or by the deconcentrated units of GOI central agencies.) The Development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
Assistant to the Secretary (Assisten Pembangunan) will appoint the local project coordinator, and&#13;
provide him with an adequate budget. The project coordinator will compile and distribute&#13;
periodic consolidated progress reports, covering all sectors, with information on both physical and&#13;
financial progress, based on data provided by the subproject managers. The Finance Section of&#13;
the Secretary's Department will maintain up-to-day accounting information on the project&#13;
utilizing the Project Accounting and Monitoring System (PFAMS) installed in all local&#13;
governments under EJBUDP.  Issuance of a local government instruction letter (SK&#13;
Walikota/Bupati) clearly establishing the above roles and functions in the appropriate local&#13;
units will be included in the APIP actions for each local government.&#13;
5.13        Central Government Responsibilities. DGCK in MPW, as the central executing&#13;
agency, will be responsible for the overall technical supervision and management of the project on&#13;
behalf of GOI. DGCK will delegate responsibility for the day-to-day management and monitoring&#13;
of this project to the East Java Province through the establishment of the agreed standard&#13;
operating procedures; the Kanwil PU, which is the regional office of the central MPW in the&#13;
province, will work closely with the provincial agencies on behalf of DGCK. The TKPP, which&#13;
has already been established under BAPPENAS leadership, will be responsible for policy guidance&#13;
and coordination, and in this role will actively participate in the preparation process for the East&#13;
Java Strategic Regional Development Program (EJUDP 3).&#13;
5.14        The Directorate General for Budget in the Ministry of Finance will be responsible&#13;
for managing the project's special account. Lead responsibility for the conclusion of the&#13;
Subsidiary Lending Agreements (SLAs) will be assumed by the Directorate General for Financial&#13;
Ii-stitutions in the Ministry of Finance. At Loan negotiations, agreement was reached on revised&#13;
standard SLAs documents for local government, and participating water enterprises. Approval&#13;
by the Bank of the first SLA for each participating local government and/or PDAM with&#13;
borrowing included in their agreedfinancing plans will be a condition of loan disbursement for&#13;
civil works or goods in that localjurisdiction.&#13;
E. PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
5.15        Procurement of works and goods will follow the "Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated January 1995 and revised in January 1996. Large&#13;
civil works contracts costing US$3 million or more and goods contracts costing US$200,000 or&#13;
more would be procured following International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures, using the&#13;
Bank's standard bidding documents. A general procurement notice would be issued in advance to&#13;
encourage participation of eligible parties. However, with the exceptions of approximately eight&#13;
sewerage and water supply subprojects involving treatment plant equipment and large pipe&#13;
procurement, essentially all procurement anticipated for project implementation in each of the&#13;
seven subsectors described in the preceding Section IV will be relatively small civil works&#13;
contracts under National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures agreed between GOI and the&#13;
Bank. Smaller civil works contracts, valued at less than US$3 million up to an aggregate amount&#13;
of US$106.7 million, and goods contracts valued less than US$200,000 up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$27.5 million would be procured by the designated subproject implementing agency&#13;
under national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank, Although within&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
these totals goods and civil works contracts for less than US$50,000 each up to an aggregate&#13;
total of US$1.0 million in each category, may be procured through national shopping and&#13;
simplified procurement procedures similar to national shopping, respectively.  Domestic&#13;
preference may be provided during bid evaluation at a rate of 15% (of the CIF price or the&#13;
applicable customs duty, whichever is lower) for local goods manufacturers participating in the&#13;
ICB procurement of goods. The invitation to prequalify or bid for each contract estimated to cost&#13;
$10,000,000 equivalent or more shall be advertised in accordance with the procedures applicable&#13;
to large contracts under paragraph 2.8 of the Guidelines, although no such contracts have been&#13;
identified for this project.&#13;
5.16        As more fully described in Annex 6, project implementation will be supported by&#13;
two types of consultants' services: (i) detailed engineering design and construction supervision&#13;
(see para. 4.18) to assist local implementing agencies (totaling US$8.7 million), and (ii) advisory&#13;
and program management technical assistance and training for institutional capacity building (see&#13;
para. 4.19) in all facets of program implementation (totalling US$10.3 million). Consulting&#13;
services under the Bank loan would be procured in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use&#13;
of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" dated&#13;
August 1981 and resulting consultants' contracts would utilize the Bank's Standard Form of&#13;
Contract for Consultant Services of June 1995, to be executed by the responsible agency for each&#13;
contract as designated in Annex 6.&#13;
5.17        Procurement Review. Contracts for (a) Civil works valued at more than US$1&#13;
million, (b) goods valued at or more than US$200,000, and (c) consultants' services by individual&#13;
consultants valued at more than US$50,000, and by consulting firms valued at or more than&#13;
US$100,000, would be subject to prior review by the Bank. The first contract for civil works and&#13;
goods for each local implementing unit would also be subject to prior review by the Bank, to&#13;
assure use of standard procedures and contract formats. The balance of contracts for goods and&#13;
civil works, including those reimbursed under statement of expenditures (SOE), would be subject&#13;
to selective post-review by the Bank. Contractors for civil works exceeding US$1 million in&#13;
value would be pre-qualified in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Terms of&#13;
reference for all consultants' services, including detailed engineering design and supervision,&#13;
studies and other technical assistance, as well as all sole source selections, regardless of the value&#13;
of the contract, would also be subject to prior Bank review. Prior review by the Bank is expected&#13;
to cover approximately 30% of the total value of contracts financed by the project. This relatively&#13;
low review coverage is justified by the generally good record of these local implementing agencies&#13;
during EJBUDP, and will be compensated for by (a) use of standardized bidding documents; (b)&#13;
prior review of each different type of contract (road works, drainage) since there are numerous&#13;
contracts of similar nature, and (c) systematic post-review by Bank staff during supervision.&#13;
5.18        Procurement Design. Where technically feasible and administratively practical,&#13;
sub-projects have been combined to form larger contracts for tendering. Procurement of physical&#13;
components has been kept separate for each agency (central and local governments, PDAMs) to&#13;
avoid administrative delays and complex payment procedures. Similarly, procurement has been&#13;
kept separate for each sector (roads, drainage, etc.) as each contract would be administered by a&#13;
different agency. However, consultants' services have been combined wherever feasible (e.g.,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
support packages for studies, institutional strengthening, etc.).  Table 5.1 summarizes the&#13;
procurement arrangements; details of procurement process design will be available in the project&#13;
files as appeared in the subproject memoranda.&#13;

5.19        Disbursements. IBRD loan disbursements will be made at the following rates for&#13;
the various main expenditure categories as detailed in Table 5.2 below: (a) civil works and goods&#13;
under the SLAs - 90% of costs; (b) other civil works - 70% of costs; (c) other goods - 100% of&#13;
foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost), and 65% of other items&#13;
procured locally; (d) consultants' services - 100% for consultants contracted by East Java&#13;
Province and participating local governments and PDAMs, and 8O0%/ for consultants contracted by&#13;
central GOI agencies. The estimated Bank disbursement by Bank fiscal year are given in Table&#13;
5.3.&#13;
5.20        In order to facilitate disbursements, GOI would establish a Special Account with&#13;
an amount up to US$14.0 million in Bank Indonesia. This account should be maintained by the&#13;
Director General of Budget in the Ministry of Finance. The Special Account would be used for&#13;
all eligible foreign and local expenditures. Replenishment of the Special Account will be made on&#13;
a monthly basis, or when 20 percent of the Special Account balance has been used, whichever&#13;
comes first. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Director Generalfor Budget&#13;
will authorize all payments to contractors from the Special Account to be made through the&#13;
KPKN Treasury offices at the sub-provincial level (with the exception of any technical assistance&#13;
contracts procured by central GOI agencies).&#13;
5.21        Disbursements from the Loan for the following types of contracts require full&#13;
documentation: (a) civil works contracts valued at more than US$1 million; (b) goods contracts&#13;
valued at or more than US$200,000; and (c) consultants' services contracts with individual&#13;
consultants valued at more than US$50,000 and consulting firm contracts valued at or more than&#13;
US$100,000. All other disbursements would be made against statements of expenditure (SOE)&#13;
for which relevant documents would be retained by the MOF Directorate General for Budget&#13;
Administration (DG TUA) and the implementing agencies and made available to the Bank for&#13;
review upon request.&#13;
5.22        The proposed disbursement period of three-and-one-half years is somewhat less&#13;
than the disbursement profile to date of IUMDP projects in Indonesia. However, as this project&#13;
has been prepared taking into account the start-up problems encountered in earlier projects, and&#13;
because of the steps taken to expedite disbursements, it is considered achievable. The project&#13;
completion date is September 30, 1999, and the loan closing date is March 31, 2000. The&#13;
estimated schedule of quarterly disbursements in shown in Annex 11.&#13;
F. PROJECT ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT&#13;
5.23        Prime responsibility for the maintenance of consolidated accounts of expenditures&#13;
and financing sources for all project components at every government level and concerned&#13;
institution (including the water enterprises) will be delegated to the provincial and local&#13;
governments, which will employ for this purpose an improved version of the Program Financial&#13;
Accounting and Monitoring System (PFAMS) used in the EJBUDP. Development of the&#13;

improved PFAMS will be addressed at the start of the Project under a component of the urgent&#13;
technical assistance program to be financed from the Surabaya Urban Development Project (Loan&#13;
3726-IND) (see para. 4.26). For each local government program (including that of its water&#13;
enterprise) the Project accounting will be the responsibility of the structural finance agency within&#13;
the local government secretariate (Bagian Keuangan). Responsibility for maintaining the&#13;
consolidated Project account and the production of consolidated financial reports will be&#13;
undertaken by the structural finance bureau within the provincial government secretariat.&#13;
5.24        Assurances were given by GOI at negotiations that the consolidated project&#13;
accounts, including the Special Account and SOEs, as well as the overall accounts of the&#13;
participating PDAMs, will be audited annually by independent auditors in a manner satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank and that the audited accounts would be submitted to the Bank no later than six&#13;
months after the end of eachfiscal year, commencing GOI FY96/9 7. Assurances were also given&#13;
by GOI during negotiations that the East Java Provincial Inspectorate (Ir Wil Prop) will carry&#13;
out annual technical audits during project implementation by October 31 of each year.&#13;
Technical assistance will be provided to enhance the capabilities of the Provincial Inspectorate&#13;
under the project, and staff of the MPW Inspectorate General will assist as appropriate for MPW-&#13;
financed subprojects; the technical audit will also review attainment status of the selected 'priority&#13;
targets" as described in each APIP.&#13;
G. PROJECT REPORTING, MONITORING AND BANK SUPERVISION&#13;
5.25        Quarterly progress reports will be prepared and submitted to the Bank by PPMO&#13;
with assistance from DGCK on the basis of inputs from the various central, provincial, kabupaten,&#13;
kotamadya implementing agencies. The reports will focus on the targets and performance&#13;
indicators established in the PPIP and APIP for each local government (see Annex 4) and will&#13;
include an overall program summary, covering progress on:&#13;
(a)   physical progress of each component&#13;
(b)   institutional development (LIDAP) and revenue improvement (RIAP) actions&#13;
(c)   consulting services&#13;
(d)   compliance with loan covenants&#13;
(e)   administration and finance, including project costs commitment and disbursement&#13;
schedule, and&#13;
(f)    a list of action to be taken by the various parties.&#13;
5.26        The progress report's substance, including indicators and the format will be&#13;
discussed at the workshop for the project launch, scheduled for May/June 1996.&#13;
5.27        Quarterly progress reports will be submitted within 30 days from the end of each&#13;
quarter, starting with the quarter ending in September 1996. On completion of the EJUDP 2&#13;
program, the DGCK together with PPMO and the participating kabupatens and kotamadyas will&#13;
prepare an Implementation Completion Report within six months after the loan closing date for&#13;
review by GOI and the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
5.28        The project will require approximately 30 staff weeks of Bank supervision during&#13;
the first year of the project, and 20-25 staff weeks for the following years of the project.&#13;
Supervision missions will include engineering, institutional, financial, environmental and&#13;
resettlement expertise. Typically, two Bank supervision missions per year are planned to conduct&#13;
the annual review (October) and to check GOI fiscal year program status (March/April). These&#13;
proposed arrangements and schedulesfor project launch workshops, as well asfor project&#13;
supervision and annual reviews (by October 31 of each year) were confirmed with GOI at&#13;
negotiations (see Annex 12).&#13;
H. OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE&#13;
5.29        Expenditure programs for the municipalities and PDAMs include O&amp;M budgets in&#13;
every subsector in accordance with IUIDP guidelines. MHA Ministerial Decree No. 5 of 1990&#13;
promulgated Performance-oriented Operations and Maintenance Management Systems (POMMS)&#13;
and revised local budgeting procedures to encourage O&amp;M. Current O&amp;M expenditures and&#13;
incremental O&amp;M expenditures (to reach necessary levels and expand coverage) are clearly&#13;
separated. Adequate budgeting for current and incremental O&amp;M is an important objective of&#13;
EJUDP2 and detailed O&amp;M expenditure plans have been included in the PJM for each local&#13;
government and participating PDAM to continue current O&amp;M and incrementally strengthen&#13;
O&amp;M to meet levels estimated by POMMS as needed to adequately operate and maintain the&#13;
existing systems and proposed infrastructure. Domestic budget sources will fully fund O&amp;M to&#13;
ensure sustainability of the increased O&amp;M level under the project. Advisory and training&#13;
assistance would be provided under the project to continue improvements in maintenance&#13;
practices. During negotiations agreement was reached that GOI will monitor the operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M) expenditures of the local governments and participating PDAMsfor each&#13;
year as well as the proposed O&amp;M budgetfor the followingyear and discuss them with the Bank&#13;
as a part of the annual program review.&#13;
1. LAND ACQUISITION, RESETTLEMENT AND COMPENSATION&#13;
5.30        East Java Province has agreed to serve as the 'pilot" area for another critically&#13;
important subject in the current Bank-GOI program dialogue: resolving the differences and gaps&#13;
between GOI Presidential Decree No. 55/1993 and Bank Operational Directive 4.30, both dealing&#13;
with land acquisition and resettlement practices. The preparation process for the proposed&#13;
project has included efforts both to avoid or minimize land and resettlement needed for the&#13;
subprojects and to develop a 'hnodel" provincial policy framework to provide operational&#13;
guidance to local governments on land acquisition, resettlement and compensation needed for&#13;
project implementation. The appraised PJMs propose very limited land acquisition and no&#13;
resettlement other than the urban renewal proposals by the City of Malang (see para. 4.17). A&#13;
Governor's Decree issuing Resettlement Guidelines and implementation instructions form the&#13;
overall  framework  for  resettlement  under  the  project.    A   local  government&#13;
(kotamadya/kabupaten) decree for preparation of subproject Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs)&#13;
in accordance with the Guidelines will be issuedfor each sub-project involving resettlement, and&#13;
included in the APIP as a condition of disbursement. During negotiations, a draft Governor's&#13;
decree was reviewed and agreed upon. On April 16, 1996 the decree was issued..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

J. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
5.31        Impacts. The proposed project has been classified as environmental category "B"&#13;
under the Bank's procedures, as the negative impacts are expected to be minor. The project will&#13;
likely produce an overall net positive environmental impact. Works under the urban roads&#13;
subcomponent should relieve congestion, resulting in reductions in air and noise pollution. The&#13;
water supply component will improve the availability of clean drinking water. Under the solid&#13;
waste management subcomponent, solid waste dumping and accumulation will be reduced and&#13;
sites will be developed as sanitary landfill sites; treatment facilities will minimize leachate and&#13;
runoff as needed. The sanitation component will improve the urban environment with adequate&#13;
wastewater and sludge treatment facilities resulting in reduced health risks from contamninated&#13;
water. Improvements of drainage canals will help control flooding and lessen the potential for&#13;
unsanitary pools of water where mosquitoes might breed.&#13;
5.32        Environmental Procedures. The environmental procedures for this project were&#13;
designed to avoid the implementation issues that were identified in the mid-term review of&#13;
EJBUDP (see Annex 13 for details). Briefly, that review showed that considerable effort had&#13;
been expended in meeting GOI requirements for production of environmental documents, but&#13;
measured by the extent of implementation in the field, the process fell short of its objectives.&#13;
Using the new GOI regulations for environmental assessment (AMDAL) promulgated in 1993&#13;
and 1994 to the project's advantage, a modified procedure was developed during preparation of&#13;
the proposed project.&#13;
5.33        Prior to negotiations, the following measures had been taken: (a) the&#13;
standardization of a process to screen PJMs, designed and overseen by provincial staff and&#13;
conducted by local government personnel to identify environmental issues and ensure that each&#13;
subproject receives the appropriate level of environmental analysis; (b) the establishment of&#13;
guidelines for the preparation of environmental management plans (UKL) and monitoring plans&#13;
(UPL), in the form of model UKL/UPL available on diskette and provided to all local&#13;
governments along with appropriate training; and (c) review of UKL/UPL for PJMs conducted by&#13;
Dinas PU, BAPPEDA-I and provincial environmental officers.&#13;
5.34        The UKL/UPL for PJMs were used as the basis for subproject screening and to&#13;
identify environmental management training incorporated into the institutional capacity&#13;
development component of the project. Although there has been a substantial improvement in&#13;
capacity to prepare and review UKL/UPL reports, the following three observations are relevant:&#13;
(a)   UKL/UPL technical guidelines for infrastructure projects currently under&#13;
preparation by GOI's Ministry of Public Works are urgently needed;&#13;
(b)   Further training in UKL/UPL preparation and review needs to be provided to&#13;
provincial and local government staff, and&#13;
(c)   There has not been a formal assignment of responsibility for UKL/UPL preparation&#13;
to local government staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
Annex 13 includes an outline of an environmental management training program to be carried out&#13;
as a priority element of the technical assistance program.&#13;
5.35        UKL/UPL Preparation and Review. UKL/UPL for subprojects are to be&#13;
prepared and reviewed as part of subproject approval (Project Memoranda), with particular&#13;
attention paid to whether the management and monitoring measures are included in subproject&#13;
design and tender documents. During project implementation, UKL/UPL review will be the&#13;
responsibility of technical agencies in the provincial government, coordinated by PTCU. The&#13;
review should include screening of any proposed project sites not already screened when the&#13;
PJMs were originally prepared, especially for final solid waste disposal sites (TPAs) to ascertain&#13;
that they are not located in protected or sensitive areas and are generally suitable for the intended&#13;
purpose. Approval of the UKL/UPL by PTCU would be a prerequisite for subproject approval.&#13;
However, the Bank will also review UKL/UPL during the first year of the project and provide&#13;
comments to PPMO. This step will be phased out as results show it unnecessary except in the&#13;
case of TPAs. Because of demonstrated problems in implementing TPA subprojects in EJBUDP,&#13;
PPMO will submit copies of designs, operating plans and UKL/UPLs to the Bank's resident&#13;
mission throughout the life of the project. The PPMO will not approve these subprojects until the&#13;
Bank has given its concurrence. The standard operating procedures for the project to be issued&#13;
by PPMO will require that no subprojects be implemented until the required UKL/UPL (or in a&#13;
few cases RKL/RPL) have been approved by PPMO.&#13;
K. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION&#13;
5.36        GOI's commitment to decentralize the planning and provision of urban&#13;
infrastructure and services reflects the intention to make the development process more&#13;
responsive to the needs of civil society in Indonesia. The current IUDP guidelines for local&#13;
government and the subsectoral technical memoranda describing subproject preparation and&#13;
implementation methodologies call for local governments to obtain inputs from targeted&#13;
beneficiaries in a proactive process. For the past 20 years, the KIP programs have effectively&#13;
mobilized community inputs to design and implementation (Op. Cit. of OED Report 14747) and,&#13;
reflecting that the IUDP process was conceived as "citywide KIP" by many key GOI officials, the&#13;
local governments have been encouraged to follow participatory approaches to formulating their&#13;
PJM proposals.&#13;
5.37        Specifically, the KIP/MIIP subprojects must be based on community surveys and&#13;
interviews, with public involvement in implementation as well as operations and maintenances of&#13;
resulting facilities strongly encouraged. Water supply and sanitation subprojects are required to&#13;
be justified in part on the basis of "real demand surveys" which include willingness to pay&#13;
responses from the community. In both the solid waste and traffic management subsectors inputs&#13;
from potential beneficiaries are strongly encouraged. Local governments' response to these&#13;
guidelines and requirements has generally been quite positive and most PJM proposals can be&#13;
presented as results of a participatory process of consultation with the representatives of various&#13;
urban communities of interest and potential beneficiaries. However, the Bank and GOI continue&#13;
to discuss improved procedures to broaden the scope of participatory inputs and generally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
improve public information and feedback mechanisms employed by local governments. The terms&#13;
of reference for program implementation advisory support specify the strengthening of such public&#13;
access to decision-making as one of the focal points of advisory services.&#13;
L. Standard Operating Procedures&#13;
5.38        East Java PPMO staff and consultants have compiled a draft of the Standard&#13;
Operating Procedures (SOP) manual for the proposed project covering all of the implementation&#13;
aspects noted in the preceeding sections, primarily based on updating (as needed) the operational&#13;
manuals from EJBUDP and recently issued IUDP and REPELITA VI guidance from central GOI,&#13;
as well as incorporating the reporting and documentation requirements of the Bank. The draft&#13;
SOP manual was reviewed during project negotiations and found to be generally adequate and&#13;
comprehensive, but with some further clarification needed to assure local governments could&#13;
directly use the manual. It was agreed that the PPMO would complete preparation and publication&#13;
of the SOP manual in time for distribution and discussion with local officials during the project&#13;
launch workshops (tentatively scheduled for May/June 1996).&#13;
&#13;

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS&#13;
6.1         Structure of Local Government Revenues. Local government normal annual&#13;
revenues consist essentially of a) locally-derived taxes, fees, service charges and miscellaneous&#13;
revenues (PADs); (b) the local share (approximately 85%) of the national land and buildings tax&#13;
(PBB) collected in the locality; c) a central government routine grant (the SDO), almost the whole&#13;
of which is provided to pay the remuneration costs of permanently established staff (which have&#13;
the status of state civil servants); and d) central government development grants (Inpres grants),&#13;
the bulk of which are accounted for by a general-use development expenditure grant and a block&#13;
grant for roads improvement. Excluding the SDO, the ratio of locally-derived revenues to the&#13;
Inpres grants has in recent years been in the order of 30/70 in typical East Java kabupatens, and&#13;
about 45/55 in most of the kotamadyas. Only Kotamadya Malang and Kabupaten Sidoarjo&#13;
(which includes substantial suburbs of Surabaya) had substantially higher locally-derived revenues&#13;
proportions, in both cases around 65/35. The special investment expenditure grants (known as&#13;
SPABP-RK, an acronym for the funds channeling mechanism) which the Bank will be financing&#13;
under the Project are required to be counterparted from the normal local revenues and central&#13;
grant entitlements, so that, inter alia they will stimulate local governments to allocate more of&#13;
these discretionary-use revenues to their urban infrastructure sector responsibilities, after meeting&#13;
O&amp;M requirements for existing infrastructure. The counterpart financing requirement imposed&#13;
the primary constraint on total program size in each local government.&#13;
6.2         Local Revenues Improvement. Local governments' administration of their own&#13;
local revenue sources has suffered from the familiar problems of incomplete registration of&#13;
potential tax and license fee assets, under-assessment and under-reporting of amounts properly&#13;
payable, under-collection of due amounts, and a reluctance to make timely adjustments to tariffs&#13;
to maintain their levels in real terms. Under the East Java-Bali Urban Development Project all&#13;
local governments prepared and implemented a first round of Revenue Improvement Action Plans&#13;
(RIAPs). The great majority of local governments have achieved, and in many cases substantially&#13;
exceeded their RIAP targets (although many of these were admittedly conservative). Many&#13;
achieved impressive average real terms growths in the revenues under their own administration&#13;
over the RIAP periods, the average being 8 percent annually. Nevertheless, there is believed to be&#13;
considerable scope for further improvement particularly in tariffs and charges for cost recovery of&#13;
solid waste and sanitation services. This is reflected in the second round of RIAPs which have&#13;
been prepared in support of the current Project, which embody targets representing an overall&#13;
average real terms growth in the revenues under the local governments' own administration of&#13;
some 10 percent annually over the period 1995/96 to 1998/99.  Annex 14 presents past&#13;
performance and future targeted growth in each revenue sources category per local government,&#13;
as appraised and agreed in RIAP documents for each local government. The following Table 6.1&#13;
displays the summary totals for local revenue realization during EJBUDP implementation and&#13;
agreed RIAP target totals for the proposed project period.&#13;

6.3         Local Government Borrowing.  Twenty-two of the 35 participating local&#13;
governments borrowed generally small amounts under the East Java-Bali Urban Development&#13;
Project. In general, GOI policy regarding the current Project is that local governments should&#13;
make greater use of their borrowing capacities, which are enhanced as a result of past and future&#13;
targeted local revenues improvements under the RIAPs, by taking appropriate amounts of the&#13;
Bank finance in the form of subloans rather than grants. However, resistance to the principle of&#13;
borrowing, especially to finance investments which do not directly generate revenues through&#13;
service charges, is common by the local governments and their legislative council members&#13;
(DPRD) who must approve all borrowings. The proposed project financing plan recognizes the&#13;
need to introduce incentives for local borrowing including a minimum level of special grant&#13;
financing, even where capacity to borrow is substantial. Borrowing capacity has been estimated&#13;
for each local government by making long term projections of amounts potentially available for&#13;
servicing debt. Local revenues were projected from the RIAP targets, and deductions made for&#13;
current and incremental O&amp;M, existing debt service and other routine expenditure obligations&#13;
together with allowances for priority future development expenditure in non-urban sectors which&#13;
would have to be financed therefrom. Two-thirds of the resultant net amount was assumed as a&#13;
safe limit for debt service obligations (implying a minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio of 1.5).&#13;
The resultant borrowing capacity estimates vary from small to very substantial. Subject to&#13;
sufficient capacity after taking into account any proposed borrowing outside the Project sectors&#13;
(there are a number of proposals to borrow domestically for revenue generating projects such as&#13;
markets and transport terminals), all local governments were requested by MOF and PPMO to&#13;
commit themselves to borrowing in proportion to their limited capacities to reduce special grant&#13;
finance and to initiate the concept of borrowing as a source of funding for their local responsibility&#13;
investment programs. Confirmation of the participating local government and PDAMs&#13;
borrowing commitments and that such proposed borrowings meet the agreedfinancial criteria of&#13;
the Bank and GOIMinistry of Finance, was obtained at Loan negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. WATER ENTERPRISES (PDAMs)&#13;
6.4         PDAM Financial Condition. The majority of the 19 PDAMs currently included&#13;
in the Project3 are in a relatively weak financial condition. Only in three cases (Kotamadyas&#13;
Madium and Malang, and Kabupaten Sidoarjo) do water tariff revenues cover operational costs&#13;
and depreciation, and in half the PDAMs revenues are currently insufficient to support O&amp;M&#13;
expenditure needs as identified by the POMMS. These problems arise mainly from a combination&#13;
of a) inherited sub-optimally designed and located systems serving extended areas with low&#13;
connections demand and/or coverage causing high unit operating costs; b) often high&#13;
staff7connections ratios and administration costs; and c) infrequent tariff adjustments.&#13;
6.5         Water Tariffs. Five of the total 19 PDAMs which will participate in the proposed&#13;
Project were also included in the East Java-Bali Urban Development Project. All have now raised&#13;
tariffs to levels at or above those planned under the EJBUDP. All 19 PDAMs included in the&#13;
proposed Project have made tariff increases in 1995 or plan increases early in 1996; the increases&#13;
range between 32-60 percent, and action programs to improve efficiency of PDAM operations&#13;
have been drafted for each PDAM, either as a 'borporate plan" or draft LIDAP. Further&#13;
substantial real terms tariff increases will be made at not more than two-yearly intervals so as to&#13;
approach, or reach and maintain, full coverage of O&amp;M costs and depreciation charges. Annex&#13;
15 summarizes the current tariff status and estimated further necessary tariff increases over the&#13;
Project period which are linked to improved service efficiency in each PDAM. As in EJBUDP,&#13;
the adequacy of tariff levels in each participating PDAM will be annually reviewed by PPMO with&#13;
assistance from DGCK as needed, and realistic forecasts prepared detailing required tariff&#13;
adjustments. Results of the process would be an important component of the annual review of the&#13;
project. Assurances were obtained during Loan negotiations that tariff adjustments necessary to&#13;
meet the agreedfinancial viability criteria (as under EJBUDP) will be completed on or before&#13;
October 31, 1996, and again January 1, 1999.&#13;
6.6         Provincial Government O&amp;M Financing Contributions. The financial capacity&#13;
analyses suggest that nine of the total 20 participating PDAMs will have difficulty in financing&#13;
adequate levels of O&amp;M (incorporating the POMMS recommendations) in the near future until&#13;
the tariff increase plans have been fully implemented. The provincial government has limited tariff&#13;
increases to 40% in each of two steps (1996 and 1998) during the project period, but in order to&#13;
compensate PDAMs for the imposed public service obligation, the province has agreed to provide&#13;
for the interim O&amp;M financing shortfalls through contributions of operating capital from the&#13;
provincial budget, estimated at a total of Rp. 7.5 billion (US$3.3 million) during the three-year&#13;
program. Such payments must be regarded as transitional only, with financial performance&#13;
criteria agreed in the APIP for each PDAM to be achieved as a condition for obtaining the&#13;
following year contribution and an established target date for financial viability. As noted in Table&#13;
6.2 below, all PDAMs are projected to eliminate the need for the operating grants by 1998.&#13;
6.7         Water Supply Investment Finance.  PDAM  investment programs will be&#13;
financed by SLA borrowing to the extent feasible on the basis of PDAM financial capacity&#13;
3More PDAMs may participate under the programmatic component of the project.&#13;

projections. Summaries of these projections are provided in Annex 15. The balance of the&#13;
needed investments for which borrowing is not feasible will be financed through Ministry of&#13;
Public Works sectoral DIP allocations from the central government budget, partly-funded by the&#13;
Bank. These subprojects are generally to complete system development or rehabilitate systems&#13;
which were prematurally converted to enterprise status by GOI. Table 6.2 displays a summary&#13;

economic analyses and revised PDAM financial capacity projections will be prepared and&#13;
forwarded for Bank approval before any Bank Loan funds can be disbursed for the relevant&#13;
PDAM programs. DGCK is also assisting PDAMs in East Java to identify and prepare additional&#13;
water supply investments to meet REPELITA VI targets. The programmatic element of the&#13;
proposed project will provide financing for these additional schemes which meet the agreed&#13;
feasibility criteria.&#13;
6.8           PDAM  Institutional Development Plans. Each participating PDAM  is required&#13;
to produce an Institutional Development Action Plan (LIDAP) or corporate plan setting out the&#13;
actions to be taken to enable it to improve current operational performance, reduce administrative&#13;
costs where these are high, and develop its capacity to cope with the progressive expansions of its&#13;
operations, often very substantial, which will arise as its investment program is implemented.&#13;
PPMO review of PDAM APIPs will confirm that each PDAM has prepared such a LIDAP or&#13;
corporate plan, or expects to have done so before the planned date of SLA or grant effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
Provincial approval for a PDAM's program will be conditional on the prior appraisal of each&#13;
PDAM LIDAP or corporate plan, and confirmation that no payment of PDAM revenue to the&#13;
local government will be made during the project period.&#13;
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFCATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
7.1         Linkage to Country Assistance Strategy and Sector Strategy. As discussed&#13;
earlier in Sections II and IV, the EJBUDP represented a significant turning point in the Bank's&#13;
CAS in general, and its urban sector strategy in particular. Establishing the operational feasibility&#13;
of working with a large number of local governments, while utilizing the provincial government as&#13;
an intermediary program manager, has given new practical scope to several of the themes&#13;
emphasized in the CAS, including the need to improve public services and productivity, to&#13;
enhance local government responsibility and capacity, and to strengthen environment&#13;
management. The proposed project design continues and broadens the EJBUDP decentralization&#13;
successes and reflects the current CAS emphasis through provision of resources for urban&#13;
infrastructure investments, supporting both sectoral and integrated implementation approaches as&#13;
appropriate, strengthening local government institutions for urban management, promoting&#13;
decentralization of responsibility for project planning and implementation, and incorporating&#13;
environmental considerations in urban development. The project also incorporates the pilot&#13;
development of a provincial framework for land acquisition and resettlement guidelines which&#13;
addresses an identified problem area in project implementation.&#13;
7.2         Analysis of Alternatives. Consideration of alternatives, including location of&#13;
facilities, technology to be employed, and prioritization of identified subprojects within a local&#13;
government jurisdiction, are all required by the sub-sectoral Technical Memoranda issued by GOI&#13;
for preparation of IUIDP proposals by local governments (see Annex 16 for summary of sub-&#13;
sectoral criteria.) In accordance with these agreed procedures, alternatives were identified and&#13;
analyzed with varying techniques depending on the sub-sector and the size of the proposed&#13;
investment (e.g. through standard cost-benefits analysis for large subprojects in water supply,&#13;
urban roads and drainage subsectors as well as for new solid waste disposal sites; least-cost&#13;
alternative analysis for subprojects in solid waste collection, human waste/sanitation, kampung&#13;
improvement programs and market infrastructure improvement programs; and simple&#13;
prioritization of extensions to service coverage from existing systems have been based on&#13;
population served, poverty conditions, and related criteria for smaller subprojects).  While&#13;
government involvement in urban infrastructure development is broadly justified because of the&#13;
strong environmental, health and social externalities present in the provision of basic urban&#13;
infrastructure services, identification of opportunities for participation by the private sector as&#13;
well as local community in project design and implementation was specifically included in each&#13;
local government PJM and encouraged wherever appropriate. More detailed discussions are&#13;
provided in the following section, "Cost-Benefit and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
7.3          Fiscal Analysis and Cost Recovery. The financial situation of local governments&#13;
as well as PDAMs has been examined and action plans for revenue improvement have been&#13;
prepared.  The project design limits the total project investment to that which the local&#13;
governments can afford to counterpart with their own-source revenues and INPRES grant&#13;
entitlements after meeting operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) requirements. PDAM financial&#13;
projections are summarized for each participating PDAM in Annex 15, including forecasts of&#13;
internal cash generation by each PDAMs. In accordance with GOI policies, the project at the&#13;
same time enhances and encourages use of local government and PDAM borrowing capacities, as&#13;
they have improved during the implementation of EJBUDP and the further improvements&#13;
scheduled in the RIAPs for the proposed project (see Table 6.1). In the roads subsector, indirect&#13;
and direct cost recovery has been established, under previous Bank projects and sector work, to&#13;
be functioning reasonably well. Direct cost recovery in other subsectors remains problematic.&#13;
See Section VI for further discussion.&#13;
7.4          Cost-Benefit and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.  Since the proposed project&#13;
provides investments in seven sub-sectors of urban infrastructure services in all seven cities and 29&#13;
districts covering a total of more than 102 urban areas, it was necessary to develop a structured&#13;
approach to economic analysis. Subprojects are classified according to investment costs, i.e.,&#13;
small (less than Rp 500 million in constant 1994 prices), medium (between Rp 500 million and Rp&#13;
2 billion) and large (over Rp 2 billion). Small subprojects must comply with the agreed planning&#13;
and design criteria (Annex 16) and their economic viability is presumed based on evaluation of&#13;
similar subprojects implemented under previous operations and the demonstrated affordability of&#13;
the technical standards adopted. Medium size subprojects are subject to a simplified economic&#13;
analysis, utilizing thresholds to select investment options, a sampling of which will be checked&#13;
during Bank supervision and annual program reviews (e.g. traffic counts on existing roads&#13;
proposed for upgrading, drainage serving densely populated areas, etc.). Large subprojects must&#13;
go through a more rigorous economic feasibility analysis with all assumptions and methodology&#13;
subject to Bank review on a case-by-case basis.&#13;
7.5         Water Supply. The current water supply systems suffer many problems. Piped&#13;
water connection ratios are generally low. Due to poor maintenance and deterioration of older&#13;
systems, almost all distribution and connection pipes are leaking, causing water contamination and&#13;
large water losses -- unaccounted-for-water of many systems is over 40%. Reservoir capacity is&#13;
also inadequate. To address these problems, the water supply component of the proposed project&#13;
will continue the system rehabilitation efforts begun under EJBUDP and provide some 120,000&#13;
new connections. The program will improve water quality and reliability by installing new&#13;
secondary and tertiary piping systems and replacing old piping systems, as needed. Water loss&#13;
reduction programns will be undertaken in all the towns to progressively reduce the rate of&#13;
unaccounted-for-water losses from their current averages of 35-40% to about 25%. Storage&#13;
reservoirs will be constructed to increase system capacity so that new source development will&#13;
generally be deferred, per DGCK guidance.&#13;
7.6          The main benefits are increased availability of clean, piped water at reduced costs.&#13;
Demand surveys of current and potential users of the water supply systems were conducted in all&#13;
service areas proposed for substantial investment under the proposed project. In light of current&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
water shortages in many service areas, and the poor quality and high cost of alternative sources of&#13;
water, the demand surveys conducted for each PDAM demonstrate that the proposed tariff&#13;
increases (32% to 60%) would not compromise affordability. Net present values (NPV) and&#13;
financial internal rate of returns (FIRR) are calculated for medium and large water subprojects.&#13;
FIRR is used as a lower bound estimate of economic rate of return and a detailed description of&#13;
the methodology is presented in Annex 16. A summary of these results for each of the initial 20&#13;
participating PDAMs is presented in Annex 15. A 12% rate of return is used as the minimum&#13;
feasible rate, in part keyed to the proposed 11.75% on-lending rate for subsidiary loan agreements&#13;
under the project. The FIRRs of selected water supply subprojects typically fall between 13% to&#13;
18%. Several subprojects reviewed at appraisal proved to be non-economic and were either&#13;
eliminated from the project or modified substantially.&#13;
7.7         Urban Roads. Urban road transport is frustrated by the lack of an integrated&#13;
major road network. Some 7,000 km of roads in East Java, most of which are district roads, are&#13;
in a state of serious deterioration due to heavy traffic, poor maintenance and inadequate drainage&#13;
systems. Traffic is congested on major urban roads and in business centers, particularly during&#13;
peak hours, as a result of inadequate traffic management and insufficient junction capacity. The&#13;
urban road component of the proposed project will provide a program of widening of major roads&#13;
and bridges, rehabilitation and maintenance of mostly district roads, including improvement of&#13;
drainage, curb and sidewalks. Traffic management programs will also be initiated in a number of&#13;
towns. Routine and periodic maintenance needs have been identified, and the road agencies will&#13;
have maintenance budgets increases and undertake improved road maintenance.&#13;
7.8         The draft report of the recent Roads Sector Study clearly documents the high&#13;
priority and significant rates of return for investments in urban areas in improved accessibility,&#13;
savings in vehicle operating costs and in road construction and maintenance expenditures, as well&#13;
as increased land and other property values. Economic analysis, including calculation of NPV and&#13;
EIRR, of all road subprojects followed the 'Urban Road Planning and Programming Manual",&#13;
which was issued by the Ministry of Public Works and prepared with the technical assistance of&#13;
two Bank projects, the Regional Cities Urban Transport Project (Loan 2817-IND) and the Urban&#13;
Sector Loan (Loan 2816-IND) (see Annex 16). The selected subprojects all passed the test of&#13;
economic analysis that requires the minimum rate of return of 12%.&#13;
7.9         Solid Waste Management. Currently less than half of the solid waste generated&#13;
in East Java's urban areas is being collected. Collection and disposal equipment capacities fall&#13;
short of fast growing demand. Much of the existing equipment is non-operational at any point in&#13;
time due to inappropriate operation and lack of maintenance. Access roads to waste disposal sites&#13;
are also inadequate. The solid waste management component will increase collection coverage to&#13;
nearly 80% and additional waste transfer depots will be constructed; capacities of existing waste&#13;
disposal sites (TPAs) will also be expanded and new sites developed. Collection and disposal site&#13;
equipment will be purchased, and programs to improve operation and maintenance of equipment&#13;
and TPAs will be implemented. In addition, appropriate access roads to TPAs will be&#13;
constructed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
7.10        The benefits of the solid waste management component arise from cleaner air and&#13;
water as a result of reduced burning and dumping of solid waste into rivers and drains, and&#13;
improved public health by reduction of disease-bearing pests, as well as from more efficient&#13;
collection and treatment. As the benefits are mainly health and environment related, they are&#13;
difficult to quantify. The planning was based on real demand and willingness to pay, while&#13;
priority is placed on communities with densities over 200 persons per hectare. The design was&#13;
based on least cost alternatives. The cost recovery will gradually improve under the project in&#13;
accordance with the agreed Revenue Improvement Action Plan (RIAP) which specifically&#13;
addresses the solid waste tariff issue in each jurisdiction.&#13;
7.11        Human Waste/Sanitation. Sludge treatment facilities and collection equipment&#13;
are inadequate and wastewater treatment facilities simply do not exist in East Java's urban areas.&#13;
Desludging volume from septic tanks is less than 20% of the estimated volume produced. Public&#13;
awareness of the health benefits of sludge and wastewater treatment is also lacking. The&#13;
wastewater/sanitation component (see Annex 5 for summary) will provide wastewater and sludge&#13;
treatment facilities and transportation equipment in Malang and six other cities. It will also install&#13;
or rehabilitate sanitation facilities with community participation and household loan programs.&#13;
There will also be a community-based sanitation education program.&#13;
7.12        The wastewater treatment facilities will serve an estimated 210,000 people. The&#13;
benefits are improved health and avoided ground water contamination. These benefits are not&#13;
easily quantified, and therefore, no NPV and EIRR has been calculated. The planning and design&#13;
were based on population density, ground water table level, and least cost alternatives.&#13;
Desludging has been operated as a private sector business since 1986 in a few localities and its&#13;
further development will be supported by the project through the construction of sludge treatment&#13;
facilities and strengthened regulation of sludge dumping.&#13;
7.13        Drainage/Flood Control. Low lying areas in the Province are subject to flooding&#13;
due to poor maintenance of old systems, insufficient capacity, and inappropriate designs of&#13;
irrigation channels functioning as drainage canals. The proposed project will provide programs to&#13;
improve O&amp;M, rehabilitate drainage canals, and normalize river banks.&#13;
7.14        The benefits are reduced flood-caused damage, reduced traffic disruption,&#13;
increased land values, and improved health, especially of poor people residing in low lying and&#13;
flood prone areas. The benefits are not easily quantifiable and no NPV and EIRR has been&#13;
calculated. However, the cost has been verified to be less than that of relocating residents and a&#13;
benefit-cost (B/C) ratio has been calculated by dividing the expected increases in land values,&#13;
which are used as proxy for economic benefits, by investments and O&amp;M costs of the proposed&#13;
schemes. The estimated B/C ratios are all greater than 1.8. The minimum increases in land values&#13;
required for the investments to be economically justified are around 3% to 6%. The expected&#13;
increase in land values as a result of the investments are around 5% to 10%.&#13;
7.15        KIP/MIIP. The KIP component, at about 3% of the total project cost, will&#13;
provide basic infrastructure services including public toilets, solid waste collection, foot path,&#13;
water supply, and drainage and cover some 200 kampungs (2,700 hectares).  Market&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
infrastructure improvements, including improvements to superstructures, will also be provided&#13;
under the project for some 80 market areas. As several recent project audits and reviews by OED&#13;
show, KIP has immediate and very positive impacts on the living conditions (i.e., access to motor&#13;
roads, water facilities, drainage, garbage collection, sanitation, lighting, education and health&#13;
facilities) of kanpung residents using low cost technologies. It is further shown that the areas&#13;
surrounding the KIP sites also benefit from KIPs as the physical and economic impacts of KIPs&#13;
ripple to neighboring communities. Moreover, the KIP scheme has been replicated through out&#13;
Indonesia, without the Bank financing. (OED Report no. 14747-IND documents these findings;&#13;
see previous reference in para. 2.4.) MIIP investments are also very much needed and are more&#13;
than covered from municipal fees on the vendors, who participate in deciding the improvements.&#13;
Formal economic analysis was not carried out for KIP and MIIP because of the difficulty in&#13;
quantifying benefits, but improvements are subject to least cost analysis according to agreed&#13;
standards.&#13;
7.16         Quantitative Sensitivity Analysis. Quantitative sensitivity analysis was carried&#13;
out as an integral part of the quantitative economic analysis for the subprojects in water supply,&#13;
urban roads and drainage subsectors.  Typical scenarios include demand reductions, cost&#13;
increases, and project implementation delays. The extent of the increases or decreases assumed&#13;
for the sensitivity analysis was based on the implementation experiences of similar type of urban&#13;
infrastructure investment projects. Special attention was given to designs for those subprojects&#13;
whose rates of return were close to the cut-off rate of 12%. Final project design and selection&#13;
took into account the results of the sensitivity analysis. For nearly all subprojects, the benefits&#13;
remained robust within normal sensitivity parameters. Summary results for water supply are&#13;
included on the subproject tables in Annex 15, while other results are available in project files.&#13;
7.17         Analysis of Institutional Capacity. The Local Institutional Development Action&#13;
Plans (LIDAPs) prepared for each local government and PDAM document the current&#13;
institutional capacities and propose specific action needed to assure project implementation&#13;
capacity and establish the foundations for sustainable capacities to deliver urban services. Section&#13;
V of this report summarizes the basic institutional roles, capacities and requirements. EJBUDP&#13;
has established that most local governments have the necessary capacities to successfully&#13;
implement the proposed project.&#13;
7.18         Poverty Analysis. As previously noted in Section III, urban poverty in East Java&#13;
is a serious problem, both in terms of total numbers of urban poor and the magnitude of the&#13;
'poverty gap"between the poor and basic measures of adequate income. The project design has,&#13;
in accordance with GOI guidelines for IUIDP programming, given priority to facilities and&#13;
services improvements for poor neighborhoods in each project locality. Most local governments&#13;
in East Java clearly recognize that it is the poor who do not have access to clean and affordable&#13;
water, waste disposal facilities, and other basic services, and who usually reside in low-lying areas&#13;
or along drains and river banks that are often affected by frequent flooding. This project is&#13;
expected to alleviate such impacts as many components are especially targeted at improving the&#13;
quality of life and the environment in the such areas. However, no explicit poverty alleviation&#13;
component, per se, is proposed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
7.19        The water supply component would increase the poor's access to clean water&#13;
while reducing the costs. An installment payment plan would be provided for piped water house&#13;
connections who would otherwise not be able to afford them. Water bills would be less than 5%&#13;
of the expenditures of low-income households. The drainage/flood control component would&#13;
reduce the frequency and duration of floods in the poor, low-lying areas. It would reduce poverty&#13;
damage and improve health conditions caused by stagnant polluted water in the neighborhoods,&#13;
and also reduce access disruptions. The human and solid waste disposal/treatment components&#13;
would reduce morbidity and improve health conditions of the poor. The road and traffic&#13;
management program, which would improve conditions for non-motorized vehicles and&#13;
pedestrians, would also benefit the poor. The KIP/MIIP component, which is targeted to densely&#13;
populated poor neighborhoods, would substantially improve the living conditions of the very poor&#13;
by providing basic infrastructure services at very low costs.&#13;
7.20        Environmental Improvements. Environmental management and mitigation&#13;
measures have been built into the design and cost of subprojects, and institutional arrangements&#13;
have been made for monitoring impacts on the environment, taking into account the&#13;
implementation experiences of previous subprojects implemented under EJBUDP (para 5.29-5.33&#13;
and Annex 13). The project will have a positive impact on the environment through water supply,&#13;
urban road improvement, solid and human waste disposal, drainage and flood control and&#13;
kampung improvement program. For instance, the water supply subprojects will provide clean&#13;
water and reduce ground water depletion. The urban road maintenance and upgrading and side&#13;
drains improvement will reduce air pollution and fuel consumption per kilometer through&#13;
improved road capacities, surfaces and traffic management. Improvement of solid and human&#13;
waste disposal will reduce soil and water contamination. Drainage and flood control will reduce&#13;
flooding and flood-related problems (frequent flooding brings water highly contaminated by solid&#13;
and human waste into direct contact with households and causes severe health hazards). KIP will,&#13;
to a varying extent, incorporate all of these improvements.&#13;
7.21        Economic Performance Indicators.   The monitoring of the economic&#13;
performance of the project will essentially be included in the system of monitoring and&#13;
performance indicators described for the whole program in Annex 4. Particularly as the key data&#13;
for benefit calculation is included in the routine project monitoring system, it will be relatively&#13;
simple to estimate the economic benefit/performance of subprojects or larger aggregations as&#13;
required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
7.22        The proposed project design acknowledges that substantial risks are involved for&#13;
both the physical implementation of infrastructure improvements and the intended institutional&#13;
development of provincial and local governments. For the physical development supported by the&#13;
project, the most significant risks include inappropriate investment choices by local governments,&#13;
inadequate inspection and/or financial controls resulting in poor quality or incomplete works, and&#13;
failure to implement proposed works due to budget shortages, land acquisition problems, or other&#13;
obstacles.&#13;
7.23        There is also a serious risk involving the pace of required institutional&#13;
development, for decentralized systems of management, finance, manpower, and related&#13;
processes, as it is difficult to predict and may not be adequate for full and timely achievement of&#13;
all project activities in all local governments and these PDAMs. The ability of the East Java&#13;
provincial government to further strengthen its capacities to perform its assigned program&#13;
management and intermediation functions is also a substantial general risk factor for the&#13;
effectiveness of the whole program. This is reflected through many specific risks associated with&#13;
project implementation: limited institutional capacity to manage implementation, delays in&#13;
counterpart funds for the project due to budget constraints, inability of local governments to meet&#13;
their revenue targets, and delays caused by protracted procurement procedures for works,&#13;
material/equipment and consultants. Communication and coordination of project implementation&#13;
is made more difficult by the large size of the Province and number of involved local agencies.&#13;
7.24        In response to such risks, the project will focus on building decentralized&#13;
implementation capacity. The physical implementation of the project will be greatly assisted by&#13;
improved transparency and accountability provided by the PPIM and APIPs clarifying the roles&#13;
and responsibility for each implementing unit. Project managers would be trained and consultants&#13;
would be appointed to help with design, implementation and supervision of the various&#13;
components of the project, and program management support will be provided to the key&#13;
provincial units, as well as to the local governments by support teams in each Assistant&#13;
Governor's sub-regional office. The financing plans have been endorsed by the agencies that will&#13;
provide the domestic funding. Standard bidding documents and procedures have been discussed&#13;
with the local agencies and to the extent possible subprojects have been packaged together for&#13;
tendering, so as to attract larger contractors who normally deliver better quality works with less&#13;
technical supervision. The Bank has planned sufficient supervision resources, especially in the&#13;
early years, for early detection and solution of problems.&#13;

EAST JAVA-BALI URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW OF&#13;
MID-TERM REVIEW SUMMARY REPORT&#13;
1.    The Bank mission to conduct supervision and mid-term review of the East Java-Bali&#13;
Urban Development Project (EJBUDP) visited Indonesia from January 29 through February 16,&#13;
1994. The mission produced seperate supervision and mid-term review reports. The supervision&#13;
Aide Memoire with immediate action recommendations has been circulated seperately. The mid-&#13;
term review summary report focused on the major new features or innovations incorporated in&#13;
the program design for EJBUDP and the overall performance of the program to date as a "pilot"&#13;
of the Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development Program (IUIDP) approach to urban services&#13;
provision by local governments.&#13;
2.    SIGNIFICANT SUCCESSES of the project to date include the local and provincial&#13;
governments strong support for the decentralization of infrastructure programming and&#13;
implementation processes, which are at the heart of the IUIDP concept. The new procedures for&#13;
local governments to have direct access to Bank Special Account funds (the channeling via&#13;
SPABP-RK) in support of their approved medium- term investment programs (PJMs) has been&#13;
particularly popular with local officials, as the mechanism provides Bank financing of the local&#13;
development budget (APBD) for the first time in Indonesia. The Revenue Improvement Action&#13;
Plans (RIAPs) for each local government have generally been shown to be conservative estimates&#13;
of potential revenue mobilization from local sources, and many local jurisdictions are now&#13;
pursuing much more agressive revenue collection policies. It appears that similar positive results&#13;
have generally been achieved for the Local Institutional Development Action Plans (LIDAPs)&#13;
in most local governments, but the systematic documentation of the LIDAP results has not yet&#13;
been compiled by GOI. Many of the successful features of the EJBUDP design have already&#13;
been replicated in subsequent urban projects of the Bank and other donors, particularly ADB.&#13;
3.    SIGNIFICANT ISSUES/PROBLEMS remain with some of the project elements,&#13;
including the technical assistance, the sub-loan mechanism, and reporting systems, most notably.&#13;
The technical assistance to support the process at provincial and local levels was delayed in&#13;
almost all cases by at least 18 months from the mobilization schedule agreed at project&#13;
negotiation, which has impaired progress and capacity-building efforts of the project in many&#13;
important areas. The project on-lending arrangements (Subsidiary Loans Agreements with&#13;
Prefinancing - SLAP) were designed by MoF, who encountered difficulty in initiating the sub-&#13;
loans; subsequent operations have already modified the prefinancing and disbursement&#13;
arrangements of this mechanism, while retaining the the basic policy elements agreed (e.g.&#13;
interest rates, terms, etc.). The Program Financial Accounting and Management System&#13;
(PFAMS) and the Performance-Oriented Maintenance Management System (POMMS), which&#13;
were intended to improve local capacities to manage and report on the progress of program&#13;
(i)&#13;
&#13;

implementation, were seriously delayed in mobilizing the needed technical assistance, but are&#13;
now approaching full installation and operation. However, these delays have made complete&#13;
reporting on project implementation nearly impossible to date. The mission noted substantial&#13;
improvements in available project documentation as compared to previous supervision missions.&#13;
4.    In reviewing the "pilot" role of the project for the IUIDP approach. the mission noted&#13;
at least six areas requiring further development of the process for use in the longer-term. As&#13;
GOI begins the Sixth National 5-Year Development Plan (Repelita VI), it is critical that the&#13;
urban sectoral program structure be clearly specified for all sub-sectors, including appropriate&#13;
standards, service/performance criteria, grant/loan support, and O/M targets. Attention is still&#13;
needed in IUIDP institutionalization, with particular regard to building process management&#13;
capacities and understanding at the local and provincial levels, which remain very uneven to&#13;
date, as well as improved coordination of central government activities and policies affecting&#13;
local services provision. Central-local financial relationships must also recieve additional&#13;
attention to appropriately balance local service provision responsibilities with the resources&#13;
necessary, within a clear and consistent program framework of central support to local efforts.&#13;
The planning basis for IUIDP is also in need of basic strengthening with the definition of spatial&#13;
nlanning/land management guidance in the future preparation of investment programs which&#13;
accurately reflects the economic development potential and environmentally sustainable intensity&#13;
of future growth in each urban area. The mission also noted that revision in local budgeting&#13;
practices, particularly in the capital budgeting function, were essential to achieving IUIDP&#13;
objectives of improved local decision-making and service delivery. Lastly, the definition of an&#13;
appropriate framework for private sector participation remains a high priority for the entire&#13;
urban infrastructure sector in Indonesia, as discussed on several previous occaisions with GOI.&#13;
5.    The mission endorsed the immediate initiation of preparation activities for the next Bank&#13;
lending operations in East Java and Bali to sustain the momentum achieved by local governments&#13;
which participated in the current program. as well as to initiate full implementation of the third&#13;
batch of local investment programs which includes the major city of Malang in East Java.&#13;
However, the new operations should address the policy framework improvements noted above.&#13;
as well as explicitly addressing environmental management issues for urban areas, which have&#13;
not recieved adequate attention in previous Bank-GOI urban programs to date.&#13;

SECOND EAST JAVA URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Project Implementation Monitoring and Performance Indicators&#13;
A.   Background and Approach&#13;
The Bank and GOI have mutually undertaken the development of project&#13;
implementation monitoring systems and attempted to define infrastructure performance&#13;
evaluation methodologies within the framework of several previous urban and water&#13;
supply projects, including four previous operations in East Java. These efforts began in&#13;
1985-86 with initial attempts to develop a "Performance-Oriented Maintenance&#13;
Management System" (POMMS) which would operate from an inventory of local&#13;
infrastructure and periodic conditions surveys to prioritize maintenance expenditure needs,&#13;
with the City of Surabaya being one of the pilot cases. In the water supply sector, a&#13;
parallel effort was mounted through the establishment of a water supply "Program&#13;
Monitoring and Development Unit" (PMDU) to monitor the implementation of two&#13;
successive province-wide projects and evaluate the progress of PDAMs toward financial&#13;
and institutional sustainability. The East Java-Bali Urban Development Project (EJBUDP)&#13;
initiated in 1991 combined the previous efforts and expanded the scope of these systems,&#13;
by adding water supply to the POIMS, as well as financial and institutional development&#13;
action plans (RIAPs and LIDAPs) for all local governments in the province. EJBUDP&#13;
also developed and installed a comprehensive computerized "Project Financial Accounting&#13;
and Monitoring System" (PFAMS) in all local governments. The proposed project will&#13;
continue to rely on these systems and assist provincial and local officials to improve them.&#13;
During the implementation of EJBUDP the Bank also sponsored research into&#13;
defining appropriate performance measurement techniques for infrastructure and urban&#13;
services delivery. The results of this research' suggest that infrastructure service should&#13;
be measured in terms of five types of parameters:&#13;
1.    Quantity&#13;
2.    Quality&#13;
3     Coverage&#13;
4     Reliability&#13;
5.    Sustainability&#13;
Findings of the East Java Bali Urban Development&#13;
Project Case Study, Performance Measures for Infrastructure and Environmental Resources&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
For all parameters emphasis must be placed on measuring levels of services delivered to&#13;
users, rather than intermediate measures of implementation or "supply" of infrastructure.&#13;
Recent Bank guidance documents on formulating project monitoring and&#13;
evaluation systems establish five stages of the project implementation cycle to be&#13;
considered:&#13;
1.   inputs&#13;
2.    process steps&#13;
3.    outputs&#13;
4.    results/outcomes&#13;
5.    impacts&#13;
Defining project performance expectations or targets in terms of the above stages of&#13;
project implementation must be done in the context of (i) existing conditions and levels of&#13;
service currently provided, (ii) current service deficits measured against effective demands&#13;
or demonstrable needs for services, and (iii) established medium-term standards or goals&#13;
for service provision (e.g. REPELITA or even PJP goals).&#13;
The following figure graphically combines these factors to form a matrix which&#13;
will be discussed with each local implementing agency in establishing their annual&#13;
performance targets and operating their monitoring and evaluation systems. The&#13;
"context" data and standards are described in the PJM document for each local&#13;
government and subsector technical memoranda (although some sub-sector measures of&#13;
needs/demands need further work and will be redefined for the proposed EJUDP3 concept&#13;
of realizing economic potential).&#13;
The project design further refines the successful EJBUDP model of decentralized&#13;
project implementation and "bottom-up" approach to selection of investment and action&#13;
priorities, which implies that monitoring of implementation progress and impact must be&#13;
focused at the local government level. However, in accordance with both GOI and Bank&#13;
requirements, project progress reporting must support a procedure to evaluate the&#13;
performance of the project in aggregate toward achieving development objectives for the&#13;
province, including all 36 local governments and 7 subsectors. Given the wide variation in&#13;
current conditions, local capacities and priorities, the project design has been structured to&#13;
support a two-tiered monitoring and evaluation process to include: (a) the continued&#13;
operation and strengthening of comprehensive program management systems in each&#13;
locality and participating PDAM as used in EJBUTDP and familiar to local officials&#13;
(generally measuring implementation performance in terms of actual input and output&#13;
quantities and process milestones versus agreed implementation/action plans), and (b) the&#13;
selection of a few key measures or "priority targets" within each local program (PJM) to&#13;

be used as indicators of outcomes or impacts of highest importance in the local context&#13;
toward attaining project development objectives.  As in EJBUDP, the provincial&#13;
compilation of all local project data will allow aggregation of project results and provide&#13;
an overview of total achievements of the project. However, such aggregations can be&#13;
misleading or give an inaccurate picture of actual outcomes or impacts of most importance&#13;
in particular urban areas. It is proposed that the attainment of the selected "priority&#13;
targets" for each locality and PDAM be used as the primary indicator of project&#13;
performance, as an adjunct to the basic monitoring systems in place.&#13;
In the proposed two-tiered monitoring and evaluation process, the established&#13;
monitoring systems correlates to the "implementation monitoring" portion of the attached&#13;
matrix, while the proposed selection of "priority targets" should include selected&#13;
measures of development objectives attainment focused on expected outcomes and&#13;
impacts, preferably toward the reliability and sustainability side (bottom-right) of the&#13;
matrix. This two-tiered system is further described in the following paragraphs.&#13;
B.    Implementation Monitoring&#13;
The systems and procedures installed in East Java provincial offices and the&#13;
participating local governments under EJBUDP and utilized in the preparation of the&#13;
proposed project enable the detailed monitoring and measurement of progress to be a&#13;
relatively straight-forward task.  A Performance-Oriented Maintenance Management&#13;
System (POMMS), now installed in all local governments, establishes current baseline&#13;
status of infrastructure systems and delivery of services, as well as O&amp;M expenditure&#13;
requirements. The medium-term program (PJM) documents for each local government&#13;
present subproject investments in terms of overcoming specific infrastructure/service&#13;
deficits in each urban area. Each local jurisdiction has prepared local government action&#13;
plans to improve own-source revenue (RIAP), O&amp;M implementation (POMMS), and&#13;
institutional capacities (LIDAP). Progress toward each of the stated intermediate project&#13;
objectives at local government level can thus be measured by:&#13;
(i)    monitoring the attainment of improvements in infrastructure/service&#13;
coverage, quantity, quality and reliability versus the PJM targeted levels&#13;
(Note:  The targeted levels vary greatly among localities as current&#13;
baselines, needs, and financial capacities to respond are quite different in&#13;
each area; project targets and progress will always be presented in context&#13;
of needs and baseline conditions in the standard reporting formats).&#13;
(ii)   monitoring the implementation of action plans for institutional development&#13;
(LIDAP) together with realization of programmed (PJM) expenditure&#13;
levels for O&amp;M and physical quantities of maintenance performed versus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
POMMS targets, as well as monitoring the realization of local government&#13;
and PDAM revenue enhancement action plans (in terms of the percentage&#13;
of potential revenue realized); and&#13;
(iii)   monitoring the preparation of all needed components for each local&#13;
government in designing the REPELITA VII strategic development&#13;
program, per the agreed work plan for this comprehensive effort (mainly&#13;
against agreed time schedule of preparation steps, to be defined with a&#13;
PHRD grant for initial design and development of preparation process).&#13;
A Project Financial Accounting and Monitoring System (PFAMS) has been installed in&#13;
each local government during EJBUDP which together with the established monitoring&#13;
procedures will produce complete information for quarterly progress reporting and to&#13;
support the regular review of the program by GOI and Bank supervision missions.&#13;
C.    Selection of Priority Targets&#13;
Utilizing the local "priority targets" as indicators to measure the overall progress&#13;
of the project toward its development objectives, requires that during the provincial&#13;
approval of the Annual Project Implementation Plan (APIP) for each local jurisdiction (see&#13;
para. 5.3 and Annex 8), mutual agreement be reached on the 5-7 priority targets which&#13;
best summarize or capture the project impacts/outcomes desired in each locality. In all&#13;
local governments and participating PDAMs, the total revenue targets and agreed&#13;
operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) expenditure levels will be among those targets&#13;
selected, but other targets will vary widely with the priorities of the local PJM and local&#13;
conditions (e.g. targets may include institutional capacity outcomes, O&amp;M performance&#13;
results for drainage, or key process steps such as site selection for solid waste, in addition&#13;
to key physical infrastructure implementation necessary to produce desired impacts). A&#13;
menu of potential targets is suggested by sub-sector in the following Table 1, and a sample&#13;
of suggested "priority targets" for the City of Malang are displayed below (final&#13;
quantified target to be established in APIP). During the annual review, local governments&#13;
and participating PDAMs meeting priority targets will be encouraged to expand/accelerate&#13;
their programs, while poor performance would result in decreased funding until targets are&#13;
met.&#13;
D.    Project Performance Indicators and Rating&#13;
The proposed project would utilize the attainment of the local priority targets as&#13;
the primary performance indicator of attainment of project objectives. The priority targets&#13;
would be classified as either "implementation progress" or "development objectives"&#13;
targets when established each year. Reporting would be done on a simple attained or not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
attained basis (pass/fail) and the project performance would be classified for both&#13;
measures on the basis of the percentage of annual priority targets attained, as follows:&#13;
Highly Satisfactory: 80% or more attained&#13;
Satisfactory: 60%-80%&#13;
Unsatisfactory: 30%-60%&#13;
Highly Unsatisfactory: less than 30% attained&#13;
Confirmation of reported results in attaining the priority targets will be included in the&#13;
scope of the Technical Audits. Further details of this approach will be discussed with the&#13;
provincial and local officials involved during project launch workshops, and assessed&#13;
during the initial Annual Review in October 1996.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
EAST JAVA URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT-2&#13;
HUMAN WASTE/SANITATION COMPONENT&#13;
This component will improve urban environmental conditions within seven cities&#13;
and 29 kabupatens throughout Eastern Java by appropriate combination of:&#13;
*  Adequate kabupatenlkotamadya-level wastewater and septic tank sludge&#13;
treatment facilities;&#13;
*  Neighborhood community (kelurahan) infrastructure;&#13;
*  Mechanisms for sustainable financing  of household-level flush toilet&#13;
connections;&#13;
*  Adequate, targeted, community-based, sanitation education;&#13;
*  Improved public and private sector capacities at DAT7 III levels; and&#13;
*  DAH7I/JI-level regulatory reform.&#13;
Thus, implementation will focus on benefits to, and the active involvement of, public and&#13;
private sector entities at 4 levels of aggregation: (i) provincial; (ii) kabupaten/kotamadya;&#13;
(iii) kelurahans within kabuipaienlkotamadya; and (iv) individual households.&#13;
A. Background&#13;
Infection and Morbidity Above Regional Average&#13;
In recent years, GOI investment in sanitation has lagged far behind investments in&#13;
related urban water supply. Although the infant mortality rate had declined during the&#13;
1980s, by 1988 it still remained among the highest in Southeast Asia at 60-70 infant&#13;
deaths per 1,000 live births. Even more alarming are the health statistics which show that&#13;
the incidence of diarrhea diseases and helminth infections in children has not declined at all&#13;
in recent years. Thus, water and sanitation facilities, combined with hygiene education,&#13;
remain essential for the prevention of infection and reduction of currently high levels of&#13;
morbidity.&#13;
Foundation for Improvement Established&#13;
Sludge Treatment. The need for adequate sludge treatment and disposal has been&#13;
identified as a significant environmental concern throughout East Java. That concern is&#13;
evidenced by the fact that 14 local governments included IPLTs and 13 have included&#13;
sludge collection trucks in their proposed programs. It will be necessary, however, to&#13;
prepare specific communities prior to commencement of operations; especially with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
respect to their responsibility for emptying septic tanks periodically and paying for that&#13;
service.&#13;
Community/Household Level Sanitation. With respect to community-level&#13;
sanitation sub-components, EJUDP-2 will benefit particularly from lessons learned from&#13;
the pilot (UNDP-financed) Community Water &amp; Sanitation Project (CWSP)l&#13;
implemented, in support of EJBUDP, during the period 1989-1994. In particular, tested&#13;
methodologies and instructional materials are now available with respect to: (i)&#13;
appropriate technologies and standards; (ii) community organization and financing; (iii)&#13;
approaches to both kabupateni/kotamadya and kelurahan-level orientation and training;&#13;
and (iv) sanitation education and social marketing.  Thus, the relatively successful&#13;
experience of CWSP will be "scaled-up" (with appropriate modifications) in EJUDP-2.&#13;
Regulatory Reforms Identified. As part of the CWSP, a total of 74 separate&#13;
laws were identified at DA TI I/l-levels in East Java which directly affected community-&#13;
based water and sanitation activities and options and specific recommendations for reform&#13;
have been proffered. Although none of those recommendations have been implemented to&#13;
date, they provide a policy foundation for action under the terms of the proposed project.&#13;
B. Project Components: Summary Description&#13;
This component of the proposed EJUDP-2 consists of 6 sub-components: (i)&#13;
wastewater treatment; (ii) kelurahan-level infrastructure; (iii) household sanitation finance;&#13;
(iv) sanitation education; (v) capacity-building at Dati 14I levels; and (vi) Dati II-level&#13;
regulatory reform. Each of these sub-components is briefly described below.&#13;
Wastewater and Sludge Treatment&#13;
Malang. The major works proposed for Malang include 6 small packaged&#13;
wastewater treatment plants to provide secondary treatment of effluent into the Brantas&#13;
river. Designs have been completed for the treatment plants, and associated small bore&#13;
collection systems.&#13;
Other sanitation components are a sludge treatment facility with truck; a city-wide&#13;
sanitation management study; private toilets; and public toilets (MCK). It has been&#13;
proposed that the sludge treatment plant should be installed at the solid waste disposal site&#13;
at Supit Urang. Although the plant has been designed, the site currently lacks water and&#13;
electricity. Therefore, costs have been included for the connection of these facilities in the&#13;
total package estimate.&#13;
I      LTNDP Project INS/88/005 was financed by UNDP and The Govermnent of the Netherlands in parallel with,&#13;
and in direct support of, the World Bank-financed East Java-Bali Urban Development Project. Joint Executing&#13;
Agencies were the Regional Water &amp; Sanitation Group for East Asia &amp; Pacific (RWSGEAP) of the UNDP/World&#13;
Bank Water &amp; Sanitation Program and the Ministries of Public Works, Home Affairs, and Health of The Govemment&#13;
of Indonesia. It should, however, be noted that communities within only three kabupaten were included in CWSP&#13;
(i.e., Sidoarjo in East Java and Badung and Denpasar in Bali).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
ANNEX S&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
Other Kabupatens/Kotamadyas.  The Project intends to provide adequate&#13;
wastewater treatment facilities to serve 140 thousand people in 6 cities outside of Malang&#13;
and Surabaya. These facilities will consist of off-site small bore sewerage/waste water&#13;
treatment plants. Proposed locations include Sidoarjo, Tuban, Lamongan, Pasuruan,&#13;
Bojonegoro, and Gresik kabupatens. In addition, 13 local governments will receive&#13;
sludge treatment facilities and trucks; 27 will build new MCKs and 5 will refurbish existing&#13;
MCKs.&#13;
Kelurahan-Level Infrastructure&#13;
The project will include a kelurahan sanitation infrastructure sub-component&#13;
which will stress community ownership and responsibility. The Project will contribute to&#13;
improving sanitation conditions approximate 100 kelurahan by installing or rehabilitating&#13;
sanitation facilities; the specific design of which will be based on consultation with the&#13;
affected households and community leaders. More specifically, kelurahan will have the&#13;
opportunity to participate in the identification, planning, management, and financing of&#13;
appropriate infrastructure investments and subsequent maintenance of sewerage/drainage&#13;
systems, septic tanks, MCKs, and community toilets within their own communities.&#13;
Almost 11,000 septic tanks will be built in 14 kabupatens/kotamadyas and 2,300 will be&#13;
refurbished in 7 others.&#13;
The community participation approach outlined above was the essence of the&#13;
CWSP. That experience has shown to be successful with regards to:&#13;
o     Needs identification for water and sanitation facilities;&#13;
o     Technology selection;&#13;
*     Community contribution to the construction of facilities; and&#13;
*     Knowledge related to appropriate technologies and low-cost O&amp;M.&#13;
Kelurahan will be eligible to participate in the proposed Project by meeting either&#13;
or both of two criteria: (i) they produce significant environmental degradation in other&#13;
areas of the KabupatenlKotamadya as a result of inadequate sanitation infrastructure&#13;
and/or (ii) the kelurahan is "poor" according to the criteria established for inclusion in the&#13;
broader KIP/MIP Component of the proposed EJUDP-2.2&#13;
The "community resilience body" (LKMD), and the Family Welfare Movement&#13;
(PKK) will both have active responsibilities for promoting community water and sanitation&#13;
program  at this level.  Most important of these responsibilities will be proposing&#13;
appropriate financial mechanisms and corresponding institutional arrangements within the&#13;
commnunity.&#13;
2     Agreement with GOI will be sought that kelurahan eligible for the sanitation sub-component of the&#13;
KIPvMIP project component will be permitted to use Inpress Desa Tertinggal (IDT) funds in whole or part for the&#13;
fnancing of Kelurahan sanitation infrastructure available under the terms of the Project.&#13;
&#13;

The project planning and implementation process at the community level will&#13;
include:&#13;
*  Preparation of a Sanitation Action Plan in the context of EJUDP-2 or other&#13;
acceptable kabupaten/kotamadya development plan;&#13;
*  Establishment of community organizational arrangements;&#13;
*  Detailed planning and design of investments with mutual cooperation among&#13;
community leaders and other public and private sector technical support staff;&#13;
and&#13;
*  Identification of financing arrangements.&#13;
Household Sanitation Finance&#13;
The need for proper toilets throughout urban and semi-urban Eastern Java is not&#13;
known, but it can be assumed that a substantial number of homes will need to improve&#13;
existing, or provide new, facilities if 100% connection to sewers is to be realized.&#13;
However, in principle, GOI should not incur expenses at the household level for capital&#13;
improvements (i.e., toilets and connections). Thus, a sustainable low-cost sanitation&#13;
program needs to have access to finance for low-income communities. It is also desirable&#13;
that it be operated on the basis of full cost recovery of capital, operation and maintenance.&#13;
So, it is desirable to establish a local level for low-revolving fund.&#13;
Therefore, the primary objective here is to institutionalize mechanisms for&#13;
financing household-level pour-flush toilets and connecting them to septic tanks and, on a&#13;
limited basis, to community sewers. For that purpose, the Project will support extension&#13;
of the "Revolving Fund Scheme" established by CWSP on a pilot basis in six communities&#13;
in Sidoarjo Kabupaten, East Java. During implementation of the CWSP, seed capital for&#13;
the revolving fund was initially drawn from GOI's budget.3 Households which received&#13;
private latrine facilities were required to repay in monthly installments according to agreed&#13;
terms; typically interest of I % per month over five years. Moneys repaid into the Fund&#13;
became available for further lending to other community households. Under the terms of&#13;
the proposed EJUDP-2, LKMDs will be responsible for monitoring repayments and&#13;
resolving and problems or disputes.&#13;
Using essentially that methodology,4 the CWSP stimulated the construction of 135&#13;
latrines in Sidoarjo kabupaten, East Java. Of those, 208 households were on schedule&#13;
with repayments as of September 1993, 43 were deferred for "good reason" and 25 were&#13;
3      During the trial period, initial "seed" capital was provided by Central Govermment. However, the system&#13;
is quite flexible in that it could be financed from a variety of sources. Thus, other sources of fmnance could be&#13;
identified for capitalization purposes. The most appropriate type of govermment funding would be from the local&#13;
government budget, since the local "house of representatives" (DPRD TK II) could approve it.&#13;
4      Manuals which provided guidelines for implementing the Revolving Fund were prepared for, and&#13;
used in, the pilot communities. Thesc manuals are still available for use during implementation of EJUDP-2 and&#13;
should require, at most, only minor refinement.&#13;

in default.5  In aggregate, the number of persons in both East Java and Bali who had&#13;
defaulted was less than ten percent of the total number of loans.6&#13;
Sanitation Education and Social Marketing&#13;
This component is directed toward increasing community awareness of, and desire&#13;
for, clean water and sanitation (although this specific project component focuses on&#13;
sanitation  services, the education  campaign will need  to  combine attention to  the&#13;
relationship  between  it and  water use).   Thus, the project will provide targeted,&#13;
community-based, sanitation education in support of sewerage/drainage systems in 7&#13;
cities, 2,000 MCKs, and a projected 13,000 household-level flush toilet connections to&#13;
septic tanks or sewers.&#13;
If the construction of such facilities is to have the desired effect, it will need to be&#13;
complemented by an effective community-based sanitation education program.&#13;
Community involvement is particularly important for effective utilization of sanitation&#13;
facilities because hygiene practices are so intimiately involved with both personal and&#13;
community behavior and preferences.&#13;
Past Experiences and Lessons Learned. Many useful lessons from experience&#13;
with community-based adult health education programs in Indonesia7 suggest that the&#13;
most effective methods are distribution of posters and door-to-door (or "cadre")&#13;
campaigns." However, for the cadre-based, door-to-door method to work, at least three&#13;
things are necessary: (i) household attitude surveys; (ii) materials based on those surveys;&#13;
and (iii) training of field workers.9&#13;
Pre-Existing Materials. A large inventory of materials prepared, under the&#13;
auspices of CWSP, to specifically address (water and) sanitation issues in East Java or&#13;
Bali are available. These include: TV spots (8), dramas (3), and "Dialogues (6);" radio&#13;
spots (20), local dramas (12), and features (6). In addition, 2700 posters (4 types), 300&#13;
leaflets, and one survey guidelines manual was produced. Finally, 'flip charts" on water&#13;
5      Financial records were very well kept in all demonstration villages.&#13;
6      In those instances where repayments were not in schedule, confidence that full payment will be made over&#13;
time remains high among village fund managers. Peer pressure plays a significant part in this. The highest default&#13;
occurred in Badung (25 households), but that was caused partly by erroneous infonnation passed by a contractoes&#13;
worinan that the latrines were free (despite agreements being signed).&#13;
7      Particular success in Indonesia has been achieved with respect to community-based education programs&#13;
regarding family planning and oral dehydration therapy.&#13;
An evaluation of CWSP's pilot demonstration of a conmmunity-based water and sanitation education&#13;
program in 12 demonstration villages of East Java and Bali concluded that the best result were achieved by door-to-&#13;
door campaigns and posters (both 98-100%); followed by radio (50-80%) and Television (50-72%).&#13;
9      For example, in support of CWSP, Lembaga Bina Swadaya, a national NGO, prepared survey materials and&#13;
manuals during July - December 1991. In addition. Bina Swadaya (another Indonesian NGO) carried-out test surveys&#13;
and prepared drafts of additional manuals. That was followed by training for 58 local counterpart team members, 225&#13;
GOI officials involved in IUMDP East Java and Bali, and 120 cadres. Finally, during the period from August 1992 to&#13;
October 1993, these same two NGOs conducted actual field trials.&#13;

and sanitation technology, community participation, health and sanitation, and revolving&#13;
fund schemes were developed for education purposes within the communities.&#13;
Capacity-Building at DA TI I/II Levels&#13;
Over the years, large numbers of DATI I/H officials in East Java have received&#13;
training to enhance technical, managerial, and financial skills across a broad range of&#13;
specialties. CWSP alone provided 225 GOI officials involved in EJBUDP with training&#13;
related to community-based water and sanitation infrastructure and services.&#13;
Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that further improvement is needed to:&#13;
*  Construct   and   maintain   core   infrastructure   at   the   aggregate&#13;
Kabupaten/Kotamadya level (e.g., operator training to ensure operational&#13;
efficiency of wastewater and sludge treatment plants);&#13;
*  Plan, program, and budget sanitation investments;&#13;
*  Provide managerial, technical, and financial assistance support to kelurahan;&#13;
and&#13;
*  Provide appropriate sanitation education.&#13;
A complete set of manuals, guidelines and other materials in support of training for&#13;
officials and NGO staff at Provincial, kotamadya/kabupaten, and kelurahan levels has&#13;
been prepared'0 and is available for use in EJUDP-2.&#13;
The Project will provide a "real world' context for capacity-building by&#13;
emphasizing the preparation of mutually consistent Sanitation Action Plans (SAPs) at&#13;
provincial, kotamadya/kabupaten, and kelurahan levels. SAP preparation supported by&#13;
the Project will emphasize a bottom-up approach which encourages and accommodates&#13;
community proposals (including contributory financing) for inclusion in DA7T II-level&#13;
medium term plans (Program Jangka Menengah - PJM). CWSP has successfully&#13;
developed and tested SAPs in Sijoardo Kabupaten, 2 other kabupaten in Bali, and has&#13;
assisted JLTDP to prepare SAPs in 45 Kelurahans in DKI Jakarta. Thus, the preparation&#13;
of SAPs has demonstrated that the process does increase community participation for&#13;
effective implementation of water and sanitation investments."I&#13;
10     The various manuals produced include the following: (i) Monitoring and Evaluation Design and Operating&#13;
Manual, (ii) Revolving Fund Design and Operating Manual, (iii) Private Sector Participation Guidelines, (iv)&#13;
Training Manual for SAP Preparation, (v) Social Marketing Survey Manual, (vi) Social Marketing Campaign&#13;
Manual, (vii) Market Survey Materials, (viii) Campaign Training Materials, (ix) Adult Training Manual, (x)&#13;
Standard Formats and Summary Fornats for SAP, (xi) SAP Preparation Manual, (xii) SAP Technology Selecton&#13;
Manual, (xiii) Monitoring and Evaluation Guidelines, (xiv) Community Participation Guidelines, (xv) Cadre&#13;
Development Manual, (xvi) Cadre flandbook, and (xvii) Community Development Manual.  In addition,&#13;
approximnately 50 local government officials in Sidoarjo (East Java), Badung and Denpasar (Bali) were trained in&#13;
Sanitation Action Planning, Social Survey and Carnpaign Techniques, Adult Learning Methods, Community&#13;
Participation Techniques, and Revolving Fund Scheme.&#13;
I I    Nevertheless, additional work will need to be undertaken to test the replicability of low-cost&#13;
technologies (e.g., pour flush twin leaching pit latrine) promoted by CWSP. Various types of waste technologies&#13;
(conventional sewerage, combined sewerage, small bore sewerage, public toilets, individual/shared toilets), and their&#13;
appropriate application relative to environmental conditions (e.g., slope, soil, ground water), service levels (water&#13;
supply, drainage, existing facilities), and social conditions (population density, land use, land ownership) also need to&#13;
be further investigated. On-site sanitation technologies need to be made more simple.&#13;
&#13;

Finally, the Project will support GOI's on-going effort to clarify the respective roles&#13;
and responsibilities of various government entities at different levels with respect to&#13;
sanitation provision, maintenance, and improvement. Successful completion of that task is&#13;
needed if significant benefits are to result from training provided by the Project.&#13;
DATIIIII-Level Regulatory Reform&#13;
A comprehensive review of existing regulations affecting financial mechanisms&#13;
(cost recovery, credit assistance and revolving funds) and other aspects of community&#13;
water and sanitation development was undertaken under the terms of the CWSP. Several&#13;
ambiguities concerning the legal responsibilities of DATl IIl1-level officials were&#13;
discovered to be ambiguous. Therefore, specific recommendations were presented for&#13;
regulatory reforn; with a particular focus on kapupaten Sidoarjo in East Java. A total of&#13;
74 separate laws were identified at DA TI i/I-levels in East Java which directly affected&#13;
community-based water and sanitation activities and options.'2 Recommendations for&#13;
regulatory reform included:&#13;
*  Amendment (or replacement) of Act. No. 11/1974 as the main basis for&#13;
maintaining clean water and sanitation at the community level within urban&#13;
environments; and&#13;
*  Application of Government Regulation No. 6/1988 concerning the improved&#13;
coordination of vertical institutions with overlapping responsibilities within&#13;
kapupatens in East Java. 13&#13;
In addition, a recommendation was submitted to the Directorate of Environmental&#13;
Sanitation (September 1992) that Presidential Decree No. 29/1984 should be amended to&#13;
facilitate the establishment of more effective revolving funds for community water and&#13;
sanitation. In any event, none of these recommendations have been implemented.&#13;
12     See Airlangga University (Surabaya) "Report on Legal Issues (East Java)," mimeo (September 1992) and&#13;
Udayana University (Bali) "Report on Legal Issues (East Java),' mimeo (September 1992), (Jakarta. CWSP files,&#13;
RWSGEAP). In addition to the 74 local regulations identified in East Java, 48 other water/sanitation-related&#13;
ordinances were identified in Bali. Specific recommendations based on these reports were submitted to the relevant&#13;
governments through formal letters from the Director of Environmental Sanitation on September 12, 1992 and April&#13;
27, 1993.&#13;
13     For Bali, it was recommended that local govermnents should be empowered to issue and cancel permits for&#13;
discharge of wastes and to enable civil service investigators to enforce violations against those not having permits or&#13;
contravening the terms of those pernits.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA&#13;
SECOND EAST JAVA URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Management&#13;
1.    The mid-term review of EJBUDP had shown that a massive effort had been expended in&#13;
preparing various environmental reports required under the GOI environmental assessment&#13;
regulations then in force. However, there were serious shortcomings in the extent to which that&#13;
effort was translated into environmental management actions -- modifications of sites or designs,&#13;
and implementation of mitigation or monitoring measures. Preparation of environmental&#13;
documents and review in Jakarta, both with limited interaction between Dati II staff and either the&#13;
consultants or the reviewers, plus an environmental assessment training program that was&#13;
implemented too late in the project and did not adequately address the needs of provincial and&#13;
local officials were the primary reasons for this situation. The environmental management&#13;
procedures for EJUDP2 were designed to avoid similar problems.&#13;
GOI Regulations for Environmental Assessment Methodology&#13;
2.    As a Category B project, EJUDP2 did not require a full environmental assessment (EA)&#13;
under OD 4.01, since the subprojects likely to be financed would not have significant adverse&#13;
environmental impacts and would be generally well suited to application of standard operating&#13;
procedures and mitigation measures for environmental protection. It was agreed at identification&#13;
that environmental assessment would proceed according to the GOI Environmental Impact&#13;
Assessment (AMDAL) regulations promulgated in Government Regulation Number 51 of 1993&#13;
(PP5 1), which is, with minor exceptions, consistent with the requirements of the Bank. PP5 1 was&#13;
amplified in 1994 in a series of decrees (KEPMEN) of the Minister of State for Environment.&#13;
Two of these are pertinent, since they provided the basis of the assessment methodology&#13;
KEPMEN 11 defines the types of activities for which environmental assessments (ANDALs) must&#13;
be prepared. KEPMEN 12 provides general guidelines for environmental management plans&#13;
(UTKL) and monitoring plans (UPL) necessary for activities which might affect the environment&#13;
but which do not require ANDALs. According to KEPMEN 12, sectoral ministries and&#13;
departments would develop more detailed UKL/UPL guidelines specifically for the sectors for&#13;
which they are responsible.&#13;
3.    KEPMEN 11 and 12 were promulgated prior to completion of the EJBUDP Batch 3&#13;
PJM's, but MPW has yet to issue sectoral UKL/UPL guidelines. To assist Dati II in&#13;
implementing the new procedures, BAPPEDA and PPMO and PPMU advisors developed a&#13;
screening matrix based on KEPMEN 11 and 12. For each IUDP sector, the matrix relates pre-&#13;
construction, construction, and operating activities that might affect the environment to standard&#13;
management and monitoring measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 13&#13;

Actions Taken&#13;
4.    As the initial step in the assessment process, all Dati II were required to fill out the matrix&#13;
for their draft PJM's and submit it to BAPPEDA -I for review. BAPPEDA reviewed the draft&#13;
PJM's and screening matrices and invited all Dati II to discuss their draft matrices in separate&#13;
meetings in Surabaya. In addition, eight PJMs were found to include subprojects that could affect&#13;
protected areas and hence might require ANDALs. During the discussions with those Dati II, the&#13;
proposals were examined in detail and, in a number of cases modified by relocating proposed&#13;
facilities away from protected areas. It was finally ascertained that UKL/UPL would be sufficient&#13;
for all subprojects in the PJM's. The Dati II were directed to use the final, agreed matrices as the&#13;
blueprints for their UKL/UPL.&#13;
5.    Appraisal of the environmental management aspects of the project will be carried out on&#13;
the basis of the UKL/UPLs for the PJMs. During implementation, more detailed UKL/UPL will&#13;
be prepared for each subproject and reviewed by the Provincial Government. Approval of each&#13;
subproject will be contingent on completion of a satisfactory UKLIUPL.&#13;
6.    UKL/UPL for the PJM's were received from all Dati II. With the exception of&#13;
Kotamadya Malang, which has preparation consultants under contract, they were prepared&#13;
primarily by Dati II staff. They were reviewed by the provincial BAPPEDA and Dinas PU,&#13;
assisted by a consultant the Bank engaged specifically for this purpose. The consultant's report&#13;
was submitted to the appraisal mission, and mission members also examined a selected number of&#13;
UKL/UPL. The review shows that Dati II capacity to produce environmental management&#13;
reports has advanced substantially since preparation of this project began, primarily as a result of&#13;
the training administered by BAPPEDA. The results of the individual evaluations have been&#13;
reported back to the Dati II concerned.&#13;
Arrangements for Subproject UKL/UPL Preparation. Review and Implementation&#13;
7.    Arrangements for UKL/UPL preparation need to be specified so that Dati II staff are&#13;
clearly aware of their responsibilities and can commit sufficient resources to the work. The final&#13;
engineering design consultant and the Project Management Office of BAPPEDA-I, using the&#13;
UKL/UPL for PJM's, will assist by preparing standard clauses for environmental management and&#13;
monitoring measures to be incorporated in all tender documents and contracts.&#13;
8.    Arrangements for review of UKL/UPL are needed to ensure that the adequacy of&#13;
environmental safeguards is considered in subproject appraisal and that the management and&#13;
monitoring measures are included in subproject design and implementation. The review will be&#13;
the responsibility of structural units in provincial government. It would be coordinated by&#13;
BAPPEDA, Seksi SLH. BLH would participate in all reviews, and the cognizant technical dinas&#13;
would be involved according to the sector of the subproject. The review should include screening&#13;
of any proposed project sites not already screened when the PJM's were originally prepared,&#13;
especially for solid waste disposal sites (TPA's, for which field visits are a necessary part of the&#13;
review), to ascertain that they are not located in protected or sensitive areas and are generally&#13;
suitable for the intended purpose. Approval of the UKLfUPL by Dati I would be a prerequisite for&#13;
subproject approval, except in the case of TPA's. Because of demonstrated problems in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
implementing environmental mitigation and monitoring for subprojects in EJBUDP (e. g. see&#13;
section on solid waste management below), BAPPEDA will submit copies of subproject designs,&#13;
operating plans and UKL/UPL to the Bank (RSI) for all 1 st year subprojects requiring&#13;
environmental review, and will not approve these subprojects until the Bank has given its&#13;
concurrence. During the first year of implementation, RSI staff or consultants will review&#13;
UKL/UPL for all sectors but will phase out this practice as soon as the quality of the UKL/UPL&#13;
work in each sector is found to be satisfactory. It would be made clear by SK from the&#13;
Governor's office, as has been done in Bali Province, that no subprojects are to be implemented&#13;
until the required UKL/UPL (or in a few cases RKL/RPL) have been approved by BAPPEDA.&#13;
9.    Arrangements for UKL/UPL implementation depend heavily on training of PIMPROs (see&#13;
section on training below), incorporation of management and monitoring measures as fully as&#13;
possible into tender documents and construction contracts, and required reporting from Dati II to&#13;
Dati I. Final engineering design consultants and BAPPEDA-I and II will ensure that the&#13;
documents include these items as general conditions of contract or sub-project specific&#13;
requirements, as appropriate. Standard operating procedures being developed by BAPPEDA-I&#13;
for this project will specify Dati-IH reporting requirements for UKL/UPL implementation so that it&#13;
is explicitly addressed by all PIMPROs, overseen by the Provincial Government, and included in&#13;
quarterly progress reports.&#13;
Training in Environmental Management&#13;
10.   Training is necessary to overcome the weaknesses in institutional capacity evidenced by&#13;
the review of UKL/UPL for this project and the experience with implementation of environmental&#13;
management and monitoring recommendations in EJBUDP. Three stages of training will be&#13;
completed before any subprojects are approved for implementation:&#13;
11.   Dati I personnel will require training in UKL/UPL regulations and preparation procedures,&#13;
as well as in the environmental issues relevant for infrastructure projects, so that they can provide&#13;
an expeditious and informed review of UKL/UPL documents and advise Dati II personnel as&#13;
needed. Two days of training will be needed.&#13;
12.   Dati II personnel need training in relevant environmental issues, environmental regulation,&#13;
UKL/UPL preparation, incorporation of environmental management and monitoring requirements&#13;
in tender documents and contracts, and methods for supervising UKL/UPL implementation. This&#13;
training will be conducted in the kabupaten or kotamadya offices so that all involved staff can be&#13;
trained. Two days of training will be needed at each Dati II. The training will include presentation&#13;
of actual case studies for each type of infrastructure project in the context of East Java.&#13;
13.   Dati I and II personnel will participate in a one-day workshop after the above training is&#13;
completed, to review the training, share views on how UKL/UPL can best be prepared and&#13;
implemented, and agree on working arrangements for preparation, review, implementation,&#13;
monitoring and reporting.&#13;
14.   The training program will be developed by Indonesian consultants qualified in UKL/UPL&#13;
and AMDAL procedures, in consultation with Dati I staff from BAPPEDA Seksi LH and BLH to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
ensure that the program meets the real training needs. The UPL and BAPPEDA training&#13;
materials already used in East Java will serve as the starting point for program development, as&#13;
these have proven to be effective. Assuming 20 staff days for program development, and a&#13;
training team of two consultants for all three stages, the level of effort to prepare and conduct the&#13;
training is 170 staff days. Assuming consulting fees of US$250/day plus US$60 per diem plus&#13;
travel costs, the estimated cost of the program will be US$60,000. These costs are eligible to be&#13;
financed under the urgent priority technical assistance component of the Surabaya Urban&#13;
Development Project (Ln. 3726-IND).&#13;
Solid Waste Management&#13;
15.   At the time of appraisal, Kotamadya Malang-had not been able to rectify the operations at&#13;
its Supit Urang TPA due to equipment failures. The Project Preparation Report (PPR) for&#13;
Malang includes a subproject to obtain new equipment, design and develop new sanitary landfill&#13;
cells at the site, clean up the improperly disposed solid waste in the present cell, widen the access&#13;
road, and formulate an operating procedure. The possible social impacts of access road widening&#13;
must be addressed further during Project Memorandum preparation.&#13;
16.   Kabupaten Malang has identified three potential TPA projects: expansion and provision&#13;
of leachate treatment at the controlled landfill that serves Batu and development of new TPAs at&#13;
Lawang (5 ha) and Kecamatan Kepanjen (2 ha). These sites have yet to be screened in order to&#13;
determine what environmental studies may be needed in addition to UKL/UPL. Preparations for&#13;
EJUDP3 will include a comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan prepared jointly by&#13;
Kabupaten and Kotamadya Malang to determine whether the proposed number, locations and&#13;
capacities of TPAs are sensible.&#13;

B. ECONOMIC APPRAISAL CRITERIA AND METHODOLOGY&#13;
Water Supply&#13;
1.   In principle, net present value (NPV) and economic rate of return (ERR) have to be&#13;
estimated for each water supply subproject. In order to cope with the large number of&#13;
(relatively small) subprojects and to take into account the limited appraisal capability of&#13;
provincial govermments, Bank staff proposed the application of a simplified methodology.&#13;
2.    Economic benefits of water supply projects are equal to the consumers' willingness to&#13;
pay for water plus external health benefits, i.e. prevention of infections caused by others&#13;
(outside of someone's won household). The external health benefits, since they are intangible,&#13;
formally don't enter the economic analysis. If substantiated, however, can be used to justify&#13;
projects with a negative NPV or an ERR below the cut-off rate of 12 percent (this procedure&#13;
can be applied in very special cases only, as an exception). In large cities with weli&#13;
functioning water supply systems there are usually enough information to obtain a reasonably&#13;
good estimate of the consumers' demand function. The water demand function, in turn, can&#13;
be used to estimate willingness to pay.&#13;
3.    Lack of data and expertise and the proliferation of intermittent water supply systems&#13;
generally made the application of this "traditional" method impossible in East Java and Bali.&#13;
The proposed simplified methodology divides piped water consumption into two parts: the&#13;
first part replaces the previous source (e.g. wells, rivers, vendors) of water use, while the&#13;
second part is a net increase in water consumption. Benefit of the first part is equal to the&#13;
cost savings (actual payments plus own labor) of consumers who on no more need to use&#13;
other sources of water supply (this is the so-called alternative cost valuation method).&#13;
Benefits of the second part, i.e., of incremental water use, is still has to be estimated using the&#13;
concept of willingness to pay and that way depends on how accurately the demand function&#13;
was estimated. However, the share of total benefits due to incremental water use is usually&#13;
small and the informnation collected in order to estimate the benefit of the first part can be used&#13;
to estimate one point on the demand curve. The full demand function is estimated by&#13;
providing the coordinates of a fictitious low price - high quantity point on the demand curve&#13;
and assuming a linear relationship between price and water demand (the method is not very&#13;
sensitive to the assumption regarding the shape of the water demand curve and to small&#13;
perturbations in the coordinates of the low price - high quantity point).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 16(b)&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
4.    Two simple, user friendly programs were developed along these lines to assist the&#13;
project preparation teams and the provincial appraisal teams with economic analysis. The&#13;
programs compare subproject costs and benefits and calculate NPV and ERR estimates (the&#13;
programs use a discount rate of 10 percent for NPV calculation). A more detailed description&#13;
of the programs (one for small projects and one for large ones) with the mathematical&#13;
formulas can be found in the project files.&#13;
5.    A further simplification in the proposed methodology is given by the possibility of&#13;
estimating a lower bound for the ERR. There are two ways to arrive at such an estimate.&#13;
One is the so-called cross-city comparison method. If (i) the average incremental cost (AIC)&#13;
of a subproject in city A is less then or equal to the AIC of a subproject in city B (or,&#13;
altematively, the water tariff of a functioning system in city B); (ii) the water&#13;
demand/consumption surveys indicate that the sources and quantity of non-piped (altemative)&#13;
water use of those households who don't have access to piped water are similar in the two&#13;
towns; (iii) household incomes are also similar and (iv) the planned average water&#13;
consumption per household incomes are also similar the same as the planned (or existing)&#13;
water consumption in city B, then the ERR of subproject A is at least as high as subproject B&#13;
(or at least 10 percent if system B already exists).&#13;
6.    The other method relies on the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) to obtain a&#13;
lower bound estimate for the ERR. In case of a proposed expansion/rehabilitation of an&#13;
already existing system, if (i) there is no real water price increase forecasted; (ii) changes in&#13;
water consumption are fully explained by projected changes in the (real) income and&#13;
composition of connected customers, then the FIRR can be used as a proxy for the lower&#13;
bound of ERR.&#13;
Drainage&#13;
7.    The overwhelming majority of drainage subprojects are very small, i.e. cost less than&#13;
Rp 500 million (about $0.2 million). Case by case economic analysis (i.e. calculation of ERR&#13;
and NPV) is required only for the larger ones which typically cost Rp 500 - 2000 million. The&#13;
benefits of these drainage subprojects are estimated either (i) on the basis of avoided flood&#13;
damage or (ii) land value increases and road maintenance cost reductions. Since estimation of&#13;
the cost of flood damages require teams usually prefer the second, less time consuming&#13;
approach. The advantage of this approach is obvious: land value increase, if land markets&#13;
function properly, is an indicator which can reflect the present value of the future benefit&#13;
stream accruing to the owners of the land in the project area. The projected increases in land&#13;
values are based on comparison of land values in the project area to land values in similar, but&#13;
less frequently flooded neighborhoods. Information on land values for the subprojects was&#13;

collected during interviews with kelurahan (sub-district) staff handling land transactions and&#13;
with informal real estate brokers. Reductions in road maintenance costs were estimated on&#13;
the basis of local experience.&#13;
Urban Roads&#13;
8.    The Urban Road Directorate of the Ministry of Public Works issued an "Urban Road&#13;
Planning and Programming Manual" to guide the preparation of all IUMDP projects.&#13;
Preparation of the manual was partly financed from the technical assistance components of the&#13;
Regional Cities Urban Transport Project (Loan No. 281 7-IND) and the Urban Sector Loan&#13;
(Loan No. 2816-IND). Economic analysis of all road subprojects are based on the application&#13;
of this manual. Using information obtained from site specific traffic and road condition&#13;
surveys, the manual is easy to use for estimating the benefits of urban road rehabilitation,&#13;
betterment, widening and new urban road projects. Two kinds of benefits are estimated:&#13;
vehicle operation cost savings and time benefits, which, if compared to the costs, make it&#13;
possible to calculate ERR or NPV of the subprojects. Further simplification is allowed for&#13;
subprojects with a cost below Rp 2 billion (about $0.9 million). For each class of road and&#13;
type of road improvement, the manual also calculates the minimum traffic level which makes&#13;
the improvement economically viable (detailed description of the methodology and&#13;
assumptions used in the manual is available in the project files). A proposed road&#13;
improvement is considered acceptable if the average daily traffic on the road is higher than the&#13;
cut-off level determined that way.&#13;
Other Subsectors&#13;
9.    A high portion the benefits of human and solid waste management and market&#13;
infrastructure improvement subprojects are intangible and accrue to the local community as a&#13;
whole and not only to the direct recipients of these services. Therefore, there is no&#13;
requirement to carry out a formal comparison of costs and benefits, however, for subprojects&#13;
with a cost of more than Rp 500 million, it should be demonstrated that the proposal is the&#13;
least cost solution which achieves the desired environmental impact. Kampung improvement&#13;
subprojects deliver a standard package of infrastructure services which was proven to be&#13;
economically viable in several Bank financed projects before. Since the economic analysis of&#13;
that kind of investment is very costly and the concentration of expenditure is low, the&#13;
economic viability of proposed kampung improvements, as long as they follow the agreed&#13;
standards, is presumed.&#13;
