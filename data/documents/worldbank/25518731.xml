Executive Summary                                                                                                      Figure 1. PISA mathema cs performance by school types and socioeconomic status, 2012&#13;
Facing the prospects of rapid aging and shrinking popula on over the coming decades, Slovakia needs a highly&#13;
skilled workforce to help generate the produc vity growth that it needs to fuel its con nued convergence of living&#13;
standards with its West European neighbors.&#13;
&#13;
Skilling up the workforce starts with equipping youth with the right cogni ve and socio-emo onal founda on&#13;
skills. Interna onal research has iden ï¬&#129;ed three dimensions of skills that ma er for good employment outcomes&#13;
and economic growth: cogni ve skills, such as literacy, numeracy, crea ve and cri cal thinking or problem-solving;&#13;
socio-emo onal skills and behavioral traits, such as conscien ousness, grit or openness to experience; and job- or&#13;
occupa on-speciï¬&#129;c technical skills, such as the ability to work as an engineer. Cogni ve and socio-emo onal skills&#13;
forma on starts early in a personâ&#128;&#153;s life. Good cogni ve and socio-emo onal skills provide a necessary founda on for&#13;
the subsequent acquisi on of technical skills. Put diï¬&#128;erently, poor literacy and numeracy skills severely undermine&#13;
a personâ&#128;&#153;s ability to beneï¬&#129;t from further training and lifelong learning.&#13;
                                                                                                                       Source: World Bank Staï¬&#128; es mates using PISA 2012 data. 40 points is the equivalent to what an average students learns in a school year.&#13;
Slovakia can do signiï¬&#129;cantly be er in preparing its next genera on with the right cogni ve founda on skills.           OECD averages of ESCS index and PISA mathema cs score are 0 and 500, respec vely. The ESCS school average is calculated by compu ng&#13;
                                                                                                                       the weighted average of studentâ&#128;&#153;s ESCS at each school. Secondary college refers to secondary voca onal schools.&#13;
This report focuses on cogni ve skills and examines results for Slovakia from the Program for Interna onal Student&#13;
Assessment (PISA), which assesses the mathema cs, reading, and science competencies of 15-year-olds. Its ï¬&#129;ndings       The explana ons for the signiï¬&#129;cant variance in student achievement seem to lie in the signiï¬&#129;cant social&#13;
suggest that Slovakia can do signiï¬&#129;cantly be er in helping students develop cogni ve founda on skills. Slovakiaâ&#128;&#153;s      stra ï¬&#129;ca on of schools, which goes hand-in-hand with early ability-based selec on into gymnÃ¡ziums and&#13;
aggregate mathema cs, reading, science, and problem-solving scores have remained below OECD averages, while            voca onal tracks; insuï¬&#131;cient eï¬&#128;orts to tackle inequity in learning condi ons faced by Slovakian students, and an&#13;
its 15-year-olds perform on par with peers of several neighboring countries, like Poland, in problem-solving.          increase in repe on rates among 15-year-olds. Finally, recent evidence (OECD 2015) points to an increased eï¬&#128;ect&#13;
                                                                                                                       from the selec vity prac ced by schools may exacerbate the segrega on of students by socioeconomic status.&#13;
    ï&#130;·ï&#128;  Slovakiaâ&#128;&#153;s educa on system is one of the most inequitable educa on systems in the European Union (EU).&#13;
       This is the most worrying ï¬&#129;nding of this report. Performance in PISA varies signiï¬&#129;cantly by the studentâ&#128;&#153;s so-   Policy recommenda ons. Slovakia has the dual challenge of ensuring equality of opportuni es and quality across&#13;
       cioeconomic background. While it is not surprising to ï¬&#129;nd dispari es in countries between skills of students    its en re educa on system. Countries like Poland have shown that with the introduc on of relevant educa on&#13;

Slovakia, like many of its European peers, faces the dual demographic challenge of an aging and shrinking                 market integra on.&#13;
popula on. Slovakia has enjoyed the advantage of robust income growth during the past two decades. In 1995,&#13;
                                                                                                                          Figure 3. Slovakiaâ&#128;&#153;s popula on age distribu on and projected popula on growth, 2010 - 2050&#13;
Slovakiaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP per capita was slightly more than 40 percent of the EU15 average. By 2013, its GDP per capita rose to 74&#13;
percent of that average (Figure 2), narrowing the gap between its living standards and those of the EU15, cemen ng&#13;
its â&#128;&#156;Tatra Tigerâ&#128;&#157; moniker in the process. However, looking ahead, its demographic challenge of an aging and shrinking&#13;
popula on could prevent that convergence in living standards from con nuing. Slovakia faces a popula on decline of&#13;
almost 10 percent between 2010 and 2050 and median ages are expected to increase from 37.2 to 48.2 during the&#13;
same years (Figure 3).&#13;

Overall, policymakers can mi gate the threats to economic growth due to popula on aging and decline.&#13;
Recommended policies usually balance quan ty and quality approaches. A quan ty-focused approach centers on&#13;
expanding the number of workers through tradi onal means such as increasing the employment rate and encouraging&#13;
immigra on. A quality approach requires, among other things, enhancing labor produc vity by raising the skills of the&#13;
current and future workforce. Slovakia has signiï¬&#129;cant room for improving its employment rate (currently at 65 percent&#13;
for the popula on ages 20â&#128;&#147;64, according to the 2013 Labor Force Survey). Moreover, young Slovaks experience a&#13;
slow school-to-work transi on. According to Eurostat, since 2011, just under 15 percent of 15- to 24-year-olds have&#13;
remained idle and are not in employment, educa on, or training (NEET). In addi on to the lost income, poor labor&#13;
market outcomes at the beginning of the professional life may have a long-las ng, nega ve impact over long-term&#13;
labor market outcomes, limi ng the possibili es of young people (Schmillen and Umkehrer, 2013; Kahn, 2010; Gregg&#13;
and Tominey, 2005). As such, skills development will play an important role in harnessing the labor poten al of both&#13;
the employed and the idle popula on. This report places the spotlight on Slovakiaâ&#128;&#153;s next genera on and explores&#13;

The importance of cognitive skills                                                                                                                     Figure 4. Three dimensions of skills&#13;
Interna onal evidence shows how much the skills of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s workforce ma er for economic growth&#13;
and shared prosperity. Interna onal evidence suggests that quality of educa on is one of the most important&#13;
determinants of long-term economic growth.1 Research has explored student assessment surveys from 1960&#13;
onward (Hanushek and Woessmann, 2007 and 2012), es ma ng that a score improvement of 50 points in PISA&#13;
would imply an increase of 1 percentage point in the annual growth rate of GDP per capita.2&#13;
&#13;
Both the share of students achieving basic literacy and the share of top-performing students ma er for growth&#13;
(Hanushek and Woessmann, 2007; OECD, 2010). A recent OECD (2015) report presents economic returns to&#13;
universal basic skills, deï¬&#129;ned as all students enrolled in secondary schooling and the performance of those&#13;
young people currently not in school raised to achieving level 1 skills (420 points) in PISA by 2030. While low-&#13;
income countries with lagging educa on systems stand to gain the most, advanced middle-income and high-&#13;
income countries can expect a signiï¬&#129;cant boost for long-run economic growth (un l 2095) simply by making&#13;
their educa on systems deliver be er for the weakest students. The report ï¬&#129;nds that on average, high-income&#13;
countries could gain a 3.5 percent higher discounted average GDP over the next 80 years if they were to ensure&#13;
that all students achieved basic skills, deï¬&#129;ned as level 1 in PISA. As will be presented in this report, a signiï¬&#129;cant&#13;
and growing share of Slovak 15-year-olds currently perform below level 1 of PISA. Ensuring universal basic skills in&#13;
Slovakia would add 5.4 percent to discounted future GDP.&#13;
&#13;
Ensuring that all have basic cogni ve skills also helps make growth inclusive. Beyond aggregate growth,&#13;
educa on improves the living standards of individuals. Individuals who are more educated can acquire even more                                         Source: Bodewig and Badiani-Magnusson (2014)&#13;

This report focuses on cogni ve skills and examines evidence from the performance of 15-year-old Slovakian&#13;
students on the PISA assessment of mathema cs, reading, science and problem-solving competencies.&#13;
Introduced in 2000 by the Organiza on for Economic Co-opera on and Development (OECD), PISA is a worldwide&#13;
study of 15-year-old school studentsâ&#128;&#153; performance in three diï¬&#128;erent disciplines: mathema cs, science, and&#13;
reading. PISA 2012 also included a problem-solving assessment. PISA focuses on the competence of students and&#13;
their ability to tackle real-life problems in these disciplines. The assessment emphasizes cri cal skills for personal&#13;
and professional development. The objec ve of the PISA tes ng is to determine how well students are prepared&#13;
to meet some of the challenges of their future lives. A sample ques on from mathema cs illustrates the applied&#13;
nature of the PISA tests: â&#128;&#156;Nick wants to pave the rectangular pa o of his new house. The pa o has length 5.25&#13;
meters and width 3.00 meters. He needs 81 bricks per square meter. Calculate how many bricks Nick needs for the&#13;
whole pa oâ&#128;&#157;.1 In assessing the performance of 15 year-olds, it captures largely those Slovakian students who are in&#13;
any one track in upper-secondary educa on and a small share of students who are s ll in lower-secondary. Since&#13;
skills forma on is cumula ve, PISA reï¬&#130;ects not just competencies acquired in those schools but competencies&#13;
acquired even earlier in the educa on system as well. PISAâ&#128;&#153;s scoring system is standardized so that the mean score&#13;
for each discipline among OECD countries in the year 2000 is 500 points, with a standard devia on of 100 points.&#13;
According to OECD, 40 points in PISA is equivalent to what students learn in one year of schooling.2 Slovakia has&#13;
par cipated in PISA rounds since 2003.&#13;

Slovakiaâ&#128;&#153;s education system&#13;
Slovakiaâ&#128;&#153;s educa on system is aligned with the skills forma on process, star ng with early childhood educa on,&#13;
and focuses on cogni ve skills-oriented learning content. Slovakiaâ&#128;&#153;s compulsory educa on system begins with&#13;

Slovakiaâ&#128;&#153;s public spending on educa on is signiï¬&#129;cantly below OECD averages. The OECD public spending               Figure 6. PISA mathema cs scores and public expenditures per student, Slovak Republic and PISA countries&#13;
on educa on averages 5.3 percent of GDP (and 6.1 percent total, public and private, spending). In contrast,        wordlwide&#13;
Slovakia spent about 4.1 percent of GDP (and 10.4 percent of total government spending) on educa on in&#13;
2011. The propor on of Slovakiaâ&#128;&#153;s public investment has remained at similar levels since 2004, although it was&#13;
marginally lower between 2005 and 2008 (Figure 3). Slovakiaâ&#128;&#153;s performance is marginally above what should be&#13;
expected given its current level of public expenditure per student and similar to that of neighboring economies.&#13;
Nonetheless, some countries with similar levels of investment, like Poland and Latvia, have much higher cogni ve&#13;

Snapshot of Slovakiaâ&#128;&#153;s performance in PISA&#13;
Slovakiaâ&#128;&#153;s 15-year-olds performed modestly in PISA 2012. In context, Slovakiaâ&#128;&#153;s PISA 2012 scores lagged the OECD&#13;
average in all subjects.4 Of the 65 par cipa ng countries, Slovakia ranked 34th in math, 40th in science, and 43rd&#13;
in reading. The diï¬&#128;erence between Slovakia and the OECD average is widest in reading and narrowest in math,&#13;
with a diï¬&#128;eren al of 33 points in reading and 13 points in math. Overall, its 15-year-olds performed worse in PISA&#13;
2012 than all peer countries in the Visegrad group and in the Bal c States (Figure 7), sugges ng that the Slovak&#13;
educa on community is failing to provide students with adequate skills for their future.&#13;

In addi on to the decline in aggregate learning outcomes, Slovakia saw an increase in test score inequality.&#13;
There has been an increased dispersion in the test score distribu on for the three subjects, sugges ng increasing&#13;
inequali es in learning. For instance, while learning outcomes in reading did not decrease much, the dispersion&#13;
in scores increased quite a bit. The standard devia on increased from 86 points in 2003 to 101 points in 2012.&#13;
This makes the reading test score distribu on quite unequal. The dispersion in test scores also increased for&#13;
mathema cs, although much less than it did for reading, from 90 to 98 points between 2003 and 2012. Inequality&#13;
for science only marginally increased, remaining broadly at similar levels as in 2003 (the standard devia on was 95&#13;
points in 2003 and 98 points in 2012) (Figure 10).&#13;

their peers in many neighboring countries, although it was below the OECD average. Conducted for the ï¬&#129;rst me&#13;

Performance in PISA and student background&#13;
Substan al dispari es in cogni ve skills emerge between students from rich and poor households. PISA allows&#13;
researchers to assess equity in educa on systems and its rela on to socioeconomic status, because it collects in-&#13;
forma on on performance and student background characteris cs (Box 2). Two measures are used in this report to&#13;
examine equity in educa on: (i) How much of the varia on in outcomes can be explained by socioeconomic status&#13;
and (ii) how much of the inequality in scores can be a ributed to ESCS (measured as the PISA score gap between&#13;
top and bo om ESCS quin les).8 Figure 12 summarizes the evidence from those two measures. Roughly speaking,&#13;
one quarter of Slovakiaâ&#128;&#153;s performance variance can be explained by the student ESCS Index, signiï¬&#129;cantly more&#13;
than for the performance of its regional neighbors (Figure 12, panel A). The diï¬&#128;erence in Slovakiaâ&#128;&#153;s PISA scores in&#13;
reading and math between its top and bo om ESCS quin les is approximately 150 points â&#128;&#147; the equivalent of al-&#13;
most four years of schooling (Figure 12, panel B). This dura on is also equivalent to the length of upper-secondary&#13;
educa on in many countries. Both indicators suggest that a studentâ&#128;&#153;s household characteris cs dispropor onately&#13;
determine cogni ve skill acquisi on.&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                  Between 2003 and 2006, the socioeconomic condi ons substan ally improved for the bo om 40 percent of the&#13;

inequitable school system. The varia on in performance between schools is a measure of how big the â&#128;&#156;school&#13;
eï¬&#128;ectsâ&#128;&#157; are, and they are closely related to how students are allocated or selected into schools. It can be argued&#13;
that the lower the between-school variance, the more equitable the educa on system is. Between-school&#13;
diï¬&#128;erences in mathema cs performance in 2012 accounted for close to 60 percent of the varia on in student&#13;
performance in Slovakia. This is signiï¬&#129;cantly above the OECD average (see Figure 16) and that of neighboring&#13;
countries such as Czech Republic, Germany, and Bulgaria. This reinforces the point that the school that students&#13;
a end predicts their learning outcomes (OECD, 2014b).&#13;

PISA performance also varies across urban and rural loca ons as well as by regions in Slovakia. First, there is a&#13;
clear urban-rural gap in student achievement that has increased over the years (Figure 17, panel A). The urban-&#13;
rural gap in Slovakia is among the largest in the region and larger than that in countries such as Slovenia, Latvia,&#13;
Romania, and Poland. About 95 percent of students in the PISA 2012 sample who speak Romani at home live in&#13;
rural areas; and over 80 percent belong to the bo om quin le (see also Box 3). Second, while in urban areas PISA&#13;
mathema cs performance decreased marginally (by less than 10 points) among low achievers and increased for&#13;
the top achievers, in rural areas it dropped substan ally for both middle and low achievers (Figure 17, panel B).&#13;
Third, performance in 2012 varied signiï¬&#129;cantly across Slovak regions (Figure 17, panel C).&#13;

but appears to further deepen socioeconomic disadvantage. There are three key messages that emerge from&#13;
this analysis. First, performance in PISA varies signiï¬&#129;cantly by the studentâ&#128;&#153;s socioeconomic background. Second,&#13;
performance varies by type of school. Third, 15-year-olds from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds are&#13;
dispropor onately represented in voca onal schools and voca onal secondary schools (or indeed are s ll in basic&#13;
schools, where aggregate performance is signiï¬&#129;cantly lower than that in general secondary schools12). Figure 22&#13;
summarizes the above evidence in a single picture showing how students from diï¬&#128;erent socioeconomic strata&#13;

birth. The majority of students who were born September onwards are s ll enrolled in basic schools (although students who are repea ng grade enter in this&#13;
group too), while those who were born on or before August have already selected between diï¬&#128;erent types of schools. Tracking takes place between grades 9&#13;
and 10.&#13;

This report suggest recommenda ons to help Slovakia increase its quality of educa on and to make the system            Promoting access to quality early childhood education&#13;
more equitable. The recommenda ons proposed below rely on the analy cal ï¬&#129;ndings of this note as well as                Expand access to quality preschool educa on. Expanding access to preschool can help improve the opportuni es&#13;
interna onal experience. Given that public spending on educa on in Slovakia is low rela ve to the OECD spending        of children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Global evidence shows that providing quality preschool educa on is&#13;
average, there appears to be some ï¬&#129;scal space to make investments in quality and equity-enhancing policies.            important for promo ng childrenâ&#128;&#153;s social, emo onal, physical, and cogni ve development; it also increases school&#13;

with 89 percent of those in the top quin le. About 14 percent of students belonging to the bo om quin le never&#13;
a ended preschool, compared with only 2 percent of students in the top quin le. An analysis of determinants of&#13;
student achievement does not show preschool educa on as a sta s cally signiï¬&#129;cant variable. This can have many&#13;
causes, including the possible lack of quality of the preschool services oï¬&#128;ered when students a ended these&#13;
programs during the late 1990s and early 2000s. However, evidence does show that Roma children who completed&#13;
ECD are less likely to be enrolled in special schools (by about 7 percent) and are more likely to complete secondary&#13;
school and less likely to be on social assistance (World Bank, 2012). Universal preschool educa on for children&#13;
aged 3â&#128;&#147;5 in Slovakia would provide a great opportunity to eï¬&#128;ec vely narrow the skills gap from the early stages of&#13;
childrenâ&#128;&#153;s lives.&#13;

            Slovak Republic - Skilling up the next
            generation : an analysis of Slovak Republic’s performance in
            the program for international student assessment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Facing the prospects of rapid aging and
            shrinking population over the coming decades, Slovakia needs
            a highly skilled workforce to help generate the productivity
            growth that it needs to fuel its continued convergence of
            living standards with its West European neighbors. Skilling
            up the workforce starts with equipping youth with the right
            cognitive and socio-emotional foundation skills.
            International research has identified three dimensions of
            skills that matter for good employment outcomes and economic
            growth: cognitive skills, such as literacy, numeracy,
            creative and critical thinking or problem-solving;
            socio-emotional skills and behavioral traits, such as
            conscientiousness, grit or openness to experience; and job-
            or occupation-specific technical skills, such as the ability
            to work as an engineer. This report focuses on cognitive
            skills and examines results for Slovakia from the program
            for international student assessment (PISA), which assesses
            the mathematics, reading, and science competencies of
            15-year-olds. Its findings suggest that Slovakia can do
            significantly better in helping students develop cognitive
            foundation skills. This note proposes several policy
            recommendations, based on an analysis of Slovakia’s PISA
            data as well as international evidence, to make Slovakia’s
            education system both stronger and more inclusive.
