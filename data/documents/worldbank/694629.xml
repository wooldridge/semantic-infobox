SECTION                                  a PROJECT  N  e......|&#13;
I.    PROJECT DESIGN&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.    The social and economic consequences of urban growth in Republic of Cate&#13;
d'lvoire (RCI) are well documented. The expansion of cities has resulted in high&#13;
infrastructure costs, and the inadequacies of land management, construction standards and&#13;
housing finance have resulted in the multiplication and growth of squatter settlements --&#13;
which, in turn, has heightened environmental and public health concerns. Despite&#13;
attempts by the Government and local elected officials over the past 20 years to provide&#13;
decent living conditions to the urban population, conditions have worsened -- especially&#13;
in the late 1980s and early 1990s, due to the downturn experienced by the economy.&#13;
Aware that housing is critical to the general welfare and to social cohesiveness, the&#13;
Government intends to implement a broad land development policy reform. As part of&#13;
this new approach, the Government also intends to help modernize the mechanisms of&#13;
housing finance -- a process already under way under the privatization policy.&#13;
2.    The substantial social housing programs implemented by SICOGI and&#13;
SOGEFIHA in the 1970s and 1980s, the land development operations implemented by&#13;
the Government under Comptes de Terrains Urbains (CTU) and the creation of Compte&#13;
de Mobilisation de 1 'Habitat (CDMH) have not prevented a deterioration of urban living&#13;
conditions. As a consequence, emergency measures focusing primarily on squatter areas&#13;
(e.g. under the on-going Municipal Support Project) are now necessary to improve the&#13;
living conditions of the poorest segments of the population. The factors responsible for&#13;
the persistent deterioration of these conditions remain: (i) the absence of a land market,&#13;
which makes it almost impossible for the vast majority of urban dwellers to have access&#13;
to land or to collateralize land for shelter financing purposes; (ii) high construction&#13;
standards, which make legal developments unaffordable for most households; and (iii) the&#13;
absence of a housing finance system linked with financial markets to provide a reliable&#13;
source of funding for home financing.&#13;
3.    An Integrated Approach for Reforming the Sector. The Government's past&#13;
strategy of subsidizing land development and housing and providing subsidized housing&#13;
credit has not worked. Experience in many other countries has established that, even if&#13;
more resources could be allocated to subsidize housing development, such a policy would&#13;
still remain ineffective, essentially because it would not prevent the most creditworthy&#13;
segments of the population from appropriating most of the subsidies. Thus, improving&#13;
the housing conditions of low-income households appears achievable only through the&#13;
implementation of a new, broader and more diversified Government strategy for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
housing sector, encompassing major improvements to both land management and housing&#13;
finance, and relying on the private sector.&#13;
4.    Urban Land Management.  While rehabilitating the housing sector can be&#13;
achieved only through a major increase of the allocation of private resources to the sector&#13;
(i.e. a major increase of the mortgage market), a prerequisite for such an increase is a&#13;
reform of the land management system whereby land can be identified, transferred and&#13;
mortgaged. For this purpose, a revision of related laws and regulations and an overhaul&#13;
of the land management services are necessary. Such changes, however, will need to be&#13;
made while taking into account local traditions. Also, building on existing structures will&#13;
be desirable, to instill confidence among the operators in the housing market as well as&#13;
the authorities responsible for monitoring its development. Such undertakings, therefore,&#13;
should involve all participants from the private and public sectors, and only a process&#13;
seeking a consensus on the conceptual framework of the reform can lead Government,&#13;
banks, developers, realtors, lawyers, magistrates and notaries to participate in the reform.&#13;
5.    Housing Finance.  The various forms of Government housing subsidies&#13;
(SICOGI, SOGEFIHA, CTU programs, CDMH) have catered for the middle class,&#13;
contrary to their initial objectives, and should be replaced. Basically, housing finance&#13;
should be provided through financial institutions and market offerings -- with public&#13;
subsidies kept strictly for the poor and managed separately in a way ensuring that their&#13;
purpose is effectively met. Relying on financial institutions (inter alia a secondary&#13;
mortgage facility, to be created) and market offerings should simultaneously: (i) increase&#13;
investment options for savings -- thus contribute to the mobilization of savings -- and&#13;
help regulate the flow of investments; (ii) contribute to the broadening and strengthening&#13;
of the financial sector; (iii) increase the volume of resources available for housing loans;&#13;
and (iv) allow public funds to be better directed to the poor -- particularly through&#13;
investments in priority infrastructure and squatter settlement upgrading. Furthermore, by&#13;
reducing the risk of mismatch and allowing competition between institutions, the new&#13;
system should result in a reduction of management costs and, therefore, of the cost of&#13;
housing finance for the households. In parallel, risks to financial institutions will be&#13;
reduced through measures such as the effective enforcement of foreclosures, and will be&#13;
better distributed.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
6.    The project will support the detailed definition and the beginning of the&#13;
implementation of a reform package for improving the efficiency and equity of urban&#13;
land and housing markets. Specifically, it will:&#13;
promote the development of a market for the provision of serviced land and&#13;
housing, especially to the moderate and low income households;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
*  foster private investment in housing, by developing a market oriented housing&#13;
finance system; and&#13;
*  strengthen the capacities of public and private sector institutions participating&#13;
in the development and management of urban land and concerned with&#13;
housing delivery.&#13;
To see that new institutions build up their capacity and that new systems, standards and&#13;
regulations are adopted, the project will also support testing these new elements through&#13;
pilot operations in land titling, management and development, and in data management.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
7.    Under its land management and development chapter, the project will help: (i) set&#13;
up a Land Management Agency for providing land to developers; (ii) establish a&#13;
regulatory environment allowing private developers (through concession d'amenagement)&#13;
to have access to and develop land, then sell plots; and (iii) regularize the legal status of a&#13;
large fraction of existing properties. The project will also support improvements in land&#13;
registration to benefit squatter settlements (of the type upgraded under the Municipal&#13;
Support Program, MSP, financed by the IDA Credit 2704-IVC), and the definition of&#13;
land development and construction standards compatible with the financial capabilities of&#13;
low income households.&#13;
8.    Under the project's housing finance chapter, the system will be reformed by: (a)&#13;
creating new institutions and mechanisms (a secondary mortgage facility -- Societe de&#13;
Refinancement Hypothecaire, SRH -- and a mortgage insurance mechanism (Fonds de&#13;
Caution) to improve low-income households' access to credit) and preparing manuals to&#13;
orient their operations; and (b) launching the first operations of private funds&#13;
mobilization. In parallel, the project will support reforms ensuring that foreclosure&#13;
regulations are enforced and collaterals can be effectively mobilized to provide security&#13;
to lending institutions.&#13;
9.    The project will support pilot operations through which the Government will have&#13;
the opportunity to assess the benefits to be drawn from the different elements of the&#13;
reforms and improve on the latter. The project will also help the Government improve its&#13;
capacity to monitor its housing policy, through establishing the Housing Steering&#13;
Committee (HSC), designing and creating a data base for monitoring the new policy and&#13;
streamlining the agencies involved in land management. Finally, the project will provide&#13;
equipment and operational support to the sector reforn and project management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
D. Project Financing&#13;
10.  ITF will contribute US$ 10 million equivalent to the financing of the project. The&#13;
Government will provide US$ 1.7 million equivalent to finance part of the project's&#13;
operating costs and to support its capacity building component. The Japanese Trust Fund&#13;
has contributed US$ 0.2 million to finance the establishment and early operation of the&#13;
project Coordination Unit (para. 46). France's Caisse .Franqaise de Developpement&#13;
(CFD) will contribute US$ 0.1 million equivalent in parallel financing for technical&#13;
assistance, essentially for auditing CDMH. CFD is likely to expand its contribution to&#13;
integrate CDMH in SRH and assist in setting up its operational procedures once the detail&#13;
of a SRH setup satisfactory to CFD is known. IFC has also expressed interest in&#13;
participating and supporting SRH, and will clarify its position when detail of SRH&#13;
structure as well as of its conditions and modes of operation becomes available.&#13;
E. Project Risks&#13;
11.   For years, the issues of land management and development and housing finance&#13;
have been raised with the Government by the Bank and other donors, with limited&#13;
success. However, as evidenced by its participation in recent urban sector work, the&#13;
Government would now be committed to reorient its policies -- notably, to privatize land&#13;
development and marketing and to reach lower income households, which can only come&#13;
with a strong and sustained political commitment. However, as the private sector&#13;
develops further, the Government's disengagement from the housing sector might be&#13;
perceived as a threat by groups with vested interests arid, under their pressure, the&#13;
Government might opt for short-term stop-gap measures against fundamental reforms.&#13;
Should the Government follow such a course, serious rejpercussions would ensue for&#13;
poverty alleviation and the development of the financial sector. ITF then should, at the&#13;
time of the mid-term review, reconsider its support for this operation and for possible&#13;
subsequent operations in the sector.&#13;
12.   Other risks relate to housing finance. Although the private sector in many&#13;
countries has shown its willingness to provide funds for housing finance, such a&#13;
willingness has yet to be demonstrated in Cote d'Ivoire. As of a recent period,&#13;
commercial banks were still somewhat reluctant to provide housing finance because they&#13;
perceived high liquidity and credit risks in such lending: liquidity risks arising from the&#13;
long term nature of housing loans and the short term character of bank deposits, and&#13;
credit risks arising from possible defaults due to either borrowers' private circumstances&#13;
or broader causes (e.g. rise in unemployment, or political disruption). The project will&#13;
address these concerns through the creation of specialized institutions and regulations to&#13;
reduce and redistribute these risks and to improve the affordability of housing. Finally,&#13;
significant risks also relate to legal and political difficulties in enforcing foreclosures, and&#13;
these will be addressed under the project through short-term technical assistance and&#13;
training to the institutions involved in such enforcements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
F. Project Benefits&#13;
13.   The proposed project will improve development procedures and the provision of&#13;
infrastructure designed more appropriately to meet the needs of shelter of the middle and&#13;
low income urban households. By reducing the risks attached to the provision of&#13;
mortgage finance, the project will also help ensure that the financial environment does&#13;
not hamper anymore private financial institutions from allocating resources to housing&#13;
finance. Thus, the project will facilitate and encourage the mobilization of private&#13;
savings, investment in housing and, therefore, some further growth of the economy and&#13;
the financial sector. Finally, the proposed project should lead to a very significant&#13;
leverage of donors funds.&#13;
G. Project Sustainability&#13;
14.   Experience in a number of other countries has established that market-oriented&#13;
systems of housing finance and development, based on an effective land registration&#13;
system and affordable physical standards, adapt to evolving needs and circumstances and&#13;
prove sustainable over time, because they are not constrained as highly subsidized&#13;
systems are. Given in RCI (a) the panting demand for housing, (b) the large number of&#13;
creditworthy borrowers (once housing investments compatible with households resources&#13;
become eligible for financing) and (c) the significant reduction and more equitable&#13;
sharing of financial risks, the new financial instruments and institutions should prove&#13;
both viable and durable.&#13;
II.   PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
A. Background&#13;
15.   Redefining the Role of Government. Past land management and development&#13;
and housing construction programs implemented according to regulations and physical&#13;
standards set by the Government and marketed at below market prices, have proved&#13;
inappropriate to address the housing crisis. These programs have acted as disincentives&#13;
for the mobilization of private housing producers, have failed to regulate the supply of&#13;
housing both in terms of costs and volume, and have created rationing. In practice, these&#13;
programs have benefited a small number of households and had an adverse economic and&#13;
social impact, as they have encouraged speculation and tied-up capital unproductively.&#13;
16.   Whereas the Government used to fund public real estate companies and was itself&#13;
a real estate developer, now -- because of the need to reduce its budget deficit -- it cannot&#13;
provide any meaningful support to the sector. It must, therefore, create the conditions&#13;
needed to mobilize funds from the private sector. For this purpose, clear legal and fiscal&#13;
policies are needed to facilitate the emergence of a housing market in which properly&#13;
informed real estate developers, financial institutions and investors will participate. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
Government's new approach has now been spelled out in a Sector Policy Letter submitted&#13;
to IDA as a condition of Board presentation.&#13;
17.   Creating a Real Estate Market. Households with monthly income of less than&#13;
CFAF 150,000 represent at least 80 percent of Cote d'Ivoire's urban population and their&#13;
demand for housing can be met only by a market that would ensure the large scale&#13;
availability of both serviced land and housing loans. Since making land available is the&#13;
first step towards meeting the demand for housing, the Land Management Reform,&#13;
described in section B below, is key to establishing this new environment. The next&#13;
bottleneck rests with the real estate finance system, which should not be constrained by&#13;
shortcomings in financial risks coverage arrangements and/or related legal setups, or by&#13;
State budgetary considerations. Where Government assistance might be needed, it should&#13;
be earmarked for the poorest groups and effectively targeted towards needy households;&#13;
also, to minimize possible slippage and ensure the desirable transparency, such assistance&#13;
should be fully distinct from the commercial credit system. The Housing Finance&#13;
Reform, described in section C below, is essential to see that the demand for housing&#13;
finance become explicit, and can be met.&#13;
B. The Land Development and Management Reform&#13;
Detailed Design and Implementation Startup&#13;
18.   Background.  Cote d'lvoire's new housing policy rests squarely on the&#13;
management of land. While the State should have a role in urban development, it must&#13;
also be recognized that, in the past, the State has proved not to be sufficiently effective in&#13;
guiding the transition from customary to private land ownership, or in organizing&#13;
mechanisms to pave the way to private real estate ownership. The situation still&#13;
prevailing facilitates practices that undermine common law principles and, therefore,&#13;
expectations are that the State should experience increasing difficulties overseeing the&#13;
transition to private ownership.  The growing ascendancy of real estate and land&#13;
promoters, is a recent phenomenon and strongly argues in favor of removing the&#13;
production of serviced lots from State prerogative. The large-scale production of serviced&#13;
land can be achieved only if the private sector is involved in land development. Towards&#13;
this end, in the future, the development of land according to agreed upon specifications&#13;
will be contracted out to promoters by the State, through a land management agency, to&#13;
be created under the project.. The measures and reforms listed below should contribute&#13;
significantly to improving the supply of serviced land.&#13;
1. Creating and Launching a Land ManagementAgency (AGEF)&#13;
19.   The Urban Development Department (Service du Domaine Urbain) in the&#13;
Ministry of Housing, traditionally responsible for implementing the land reserves policy,&#13;
will continue to hold title to land reserves. However, in the future, the Department will&#13;
delegate the operational responsibility of assembling land reserves through purchasing&#13;
land from customary chiefs (purge des droits coutumiers), to a land management agency,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
Agence de Gestion Fonciere (AGEF) to be created no later than December 31, 1997.&#13;
Under this arrangement, AGEF will be a service provider to Service du Domaine Urbain;&#13;
it will also help local governments establish and manage land reserves. The project will&#13;
help define AGEF's functions, responsibilities and resource needs and draft the agency's&#13;
bylaws. Furthermore, an inventory of Service des Ventes Immobilires (SVI) will be&#13;
made and its resources allocated to the AGEF, and a Law will convert CTU into a Land&#13;
Development Fund. The cost of this project subcomponent (see Matrix: measures #1-2)&#13;
is estimated at US$ 250,000.&#13;
20.   To start building some experience in its land assembly function, AGEF, under the&#13;
project, will undertake a first operation of land acquisition, testing how effective it is at&#13;
carrying out settlement of customary land rights (purge des droits coutumiers). The cost&#13;
of this project subcomponent (see Matrix: measure #3) is estimated at US$ 100,000.&#13;
2. Introducing Private Land Development Thtrough Concession Contracts&#13;
21.   In the future, land development will be carried out by private developers under&#13;
contract with AGEF. For developing a site, AGEF will have consultants define the&#13;
technical and financial specifications (Cahier des Charges) to be annexed to the&#13;
concession agreement, call for bids from developers, analyze and compare the bids, then&#13;
award a development concession. Developers, once awarded a concession, will become&#13;
temporary owners of the land, will develop it according to Cahier des Charges, and be&#13;
allowed to sell building plots with clear title, without having to obtain a certification of&#13;
edification (constat de mise en valeur) as done at present. Service du Domaine Urbain&#13;
will oversee the compliance with all the contractual clauses in the concession agreement.&#13;
Procedures for the above modus operandi are detailed in the draft implementation decree&#13;
of the Law on concession. This will ensure diversity and autonomy of, as well as&#13;
competition among potential concession holders and compliance with the Law on&#13;
concession. Promulgation of the above Law and decree -- already approved by the&#13;
Parliament and the Council of Ministers as a condition of Board presentation -- is a&#13;
condition of Credit effectiveness. A model deferred delivery sales contract will also be&#13;
prepared under the project, for use by land developers in their sale of serviced plots,&#13;
which should help them reduce their needs of prefinancing. The cost of this project&#13;
subcomponent (see Matrix: measure #4) is estimated at US$ 50,000.&#13;
22.   To test the new practice of land development through concession contracts, the&#13;
effectiveness of such contracts and their enforcement by the Administration, the project&#13;
will finance technical and financial studies for two operations. These pilot operations&#13;
will provide an opportunity to test the assessment by AGEF of developers' potential&#13;
capacities and its process of selecting developers, and to assess the time needed to turn&#13;
the stock over and AGEF's ability to control the quality of such operations. The cost of&#13;
this project subcomponent (see Matrix: measure #5) is estimated at US$ 2.8 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3. Clearing the Land Titling Backlog&#13;
23.   The primary obstacle to the development of a mortgage market in C6te d'lvoire is&#13;
the scarcity of mortgage guarantees secured by a land title. According to Cote d'Ivoire's&#13;
law, even if a plot has been developed, a concession provisoire (temporary land title,&#13;
transferable, in principle) on this plot can be canceled by the State. As a consequence,&#13;
financial institutions are hesitant to accept temporary titles as security. A priority,&#13;
therefore, is to increase the number of legitimate land titles that cannot be legally&#13;
contested. This can be achieved readily by regularizing the status of all properties with a&#13;
temporary land title or properties of an otherwise uncertain legal status. This should have&#13;
the effect of (i) increasing substantially the size of the market; and, as a consequence, (ii)&#13;
permitting more pertinent assessments of the quality of mortgage guarantees.&#13;
24.   Under the project, the backlog in legal registration would be caught up with by&#13;
adopting streamlined procedures recently drafted by the Government. In accordance with&#13;
these procedures, (a) plots awarded more than five years ago and still undeveloped, or the&#13;
development of which is valued at less than CFAF 1 million, will revert to the State; and&#13;
(b) constats de mise en valeur will be delivered on the basis of fiscal evaluations already&#13;
available with the Administration. Estimates are that the status of at least 95,000&#13;
properties could be regularized in about 3 years. Support to this operation will be&#13;
provided under the project, through the provision of the necessary means to the&#13;
Directorates of Conservation Fonciere in the Ministry of Finance and Service du&#13;
Domaine Urbain (see Matrix: measure #6). This project subcomponent is estimated to&#13;
cost US$ 200,000.&#13;
25.   Under the project, a pilot operation in two districts will give an opportunity to test&#13;
the new procedures before they are adopted and followed throughout Abidjan. Under the&#13;
project, (a) regularization procedures will be finalized; (b) an inventory of the land status&#13;
will be carried out in the districts selected; and (c) the implementation of the procedures&#13;
will be fully documented so as to permit further improvements to these procedures as&#13;
deemed necessary. The cost of this project subcomponent (see Matrix: measure #7) is&#13;
estimated at US$ 150,000.&#13;
4. Reducing t/he Cost of Serviced Land and Construction&#13;
26.   Under the project, a detailed study will be carried out to define standards for land&#13;
development and housing construction (the latter, in consultation with the industry)&#13;
consistent with local conditions and constraints -- notably, on the basis of affordability&#13;
levels, to ensure that the market price of serviced plots and shelter units are affordable by&#13;
low income households. Also, in collaboration with the inclustry, (a) an analysis of the&#13;
impact of taxation on the building industry will be carried out to identify ways to remove&#13;
disincentives for builders to enter the formal sector, as most of them are presently in the&#13;
informal sector; and (b) specific actions will be undertaken to encourage a more intensive&#13;
use of labor and a greater utilization of local materials. Finally, the existing system of&#13;
duties on land transfers will be reviewed to identify ways by which transaction costs can&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
be reduced and thus the land market made more active. The cost of this project&#13;
subcomponent (see Matrix: measure #8) is estimated at US$ 240,000.&#13;
27.   To test the conditions of production and marketing of low cost developed plots,&#13;
the project will support two pilot operations to develop such plots to be sold at market&#13;
prices to low-income households, i.e. households with monthly income of less than&#13;
CFAF 200,000 in 1996 terms. Plots will be sold, or "rented" under a system of long term&#13;
allocation (baux emphyteothiques) payable in a single up-front payment. The cost of this&#13;
project subcomponent (see Matrix: measure #9) is estimated at US$ 1.8 million.&#13;
5. Accelerating the Privatization of State Owned Land and Housing&#13;
28.   Compared with other countries in the region, C6te d'Ivoire has a relatively large&#13;
public stock of land and housing units. The use of this stock could be greatly improved if&#13;
its management were to be private; correspondingly, market growth and fluidity would be&#13;
greatly enhanced by such a transfer. Also, part of the demand -- particularly, that for low&#13;
and moderately priced housing units -- could be met by facilitating the purchase of this&#13;
stock. This would require that regulations be amended so that the State-owned stock can&#13;
be put up for sale. The prerequisite analyses, the preparation of such amendments and the&#13;
preparation of model sale contracts would be provided for under the project. The cost of&#13;
this project subcomponent (see Matrix: measure #10) is estimated at US$ 70,000.&#13;
C. The Housing Finance Reform&#13;
Detailed Design and Implementation Startup&#13;
29.   Background. The present "lease with option to buy" system often results in sales&#13;
below the market value. This is not a sound basis for market financing and affects&#13;
adversely the development of such financing. A system of mortgage lending with&#13;
transfer of property at the time of sale is far more appropriate and conducive to wider&#13;
market financing. Under the project, new regulations and contracts will be developed&#13;
(a) to facilitate the sale of new housing, as well as the turnover of the existing stock; and&#13;
(b) to make it possible for developers to secure prefinancing for their operations. Also,&#13;
the Government, to encourage investors to invest in jointly owned property, will revise&#13;
joint ownership regulations.&#13;
30.   Although a number of elements of a full financial system are already operational&#13;
in RCI, a market in housing loans does not yet exist. The project, therefore, will examine&#13;
means of increasing the mobilization of term resources, for the banking system to be able&#13;
to expand and diversify its operation in mortgage lending. Other objectives will be to&#13;
expand the range and depth of the financial sector and to enhance competitiveness among&#13;
lenders -- leading inter alia to lower costs of housing finance to households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
1. Creating a Secondary Mortgage Financing Facility (SRH)&#13;
31.   Equipped with the necessary guarantees, a secondary mortgage financing facility -&#13;
- the creation of which no later than June 30, 1999 will be supported under the project, as&#13;
Societe de Refinancement Hypothecaire (SRH) -- should be able to provide the banking&#13;
system with long-term resources in amounts less constrained than under the CDMH&#13;
State-funded scheme, and thus facilitate access to credcit for potential homeowners.&#13;
SRH's structure of capital, terms of offerings, borrowing capacity, etc. will be defined in&#13;
detail under the project -- seeing that the SRH operation be coherent with, and fully&#13;
integrated in the whole Ivorian financial sector reformed along the lines soon to be&#13;
defined under a separate ITF operation, the proposed Financial Sector Development&#13;
(FSD) project. Expectations are that SRH would basically be a private entity, mobilizing&#13;
funds on the capital market, in which financial and non-financial institutions would&#13;
participate. CDMH operations, as run in the past, will be discontinued. Government&#13;
assets in CDMH will be assessed and would probably be transferred to SRH.&#13;
32.  Improvements in cost transparency and in the quality of guarantees offered by&#13;
borrowers (para 35), combined with competition among lending institutions, should make&#13;
it possible for the cost of funds for borrowers to be close to that of medium term&#13;
resources. In turn, moderate costs of funds should result in expanding the borrowing and&#13;
investment capacity of households, and bring better housing within reach of the less&#13;
affluent social groups.&#13;
33.   Another important benefit expected from the establishment of SRH is the&#13;
introduction of new long-term savings products on the market, which will greatly&#13;
contribute to the modernization, and enhancement of the efficiency of the financial sector&#13;
as sought under the FSD operation. For, a better match could then be achieved between&#13;
the instruments offered and the needs and opportunities of participants in the market --&#13;
notably, insurance companies and pension funds. Setting up the SRH will be supported&#13;
by the project. The cost of this project subcomponent (see Matrix: measure #11) is&#13;
estimated at US$ 440, 000.&#13;
2. Creating a Guarantee Fund to Improve the Access of Low-Income Households&#13;
34.   The feasibility will be studied of creating a guarantee fund (Fonds de Caution) no&#13;
later than June 30, 1999 -- a mortgage insurance mechanism to improve households'&#13;
access to credit -- intended specifically to supplement the guarantees given by low-&#13;
income households.  Financed in comparable shares by borrowers' deposits and&#13;
allocations from the State, the Fund would be used exclusively to guarantee loans for&#13;
low-cost serviced plots or housing units (CFAF 5 million or less) meeting minimum&#13;
standards, yet remain affordable by low-income families. Funds would be used to cover&#13;
borrowers' defaults in the event of unemployment or disability -- death being already&#13;
covered by compulsory insurance or other ways. The cost of this project subcomponent&#13;
(see Matrix: measure #12) is estimated at US$ 240,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
3. Strengthening the Legal Enforcement of Foreclosures&#13;
35.   To promote the realization of securities, the project will seek to strengthen the&#13;
role, capabilities and capacities of Courts, by training magistrates and legal assistants, by&#13;
computerizing court proceedings and by establishing an information link between the&#13;
Courts and the Land Management Department in the Ministry of Finance (see Matrix:&#13;
measure #13). The cost of this project subcomponent was estimated at US$ 220,000.&#13;
4. Stimulating the Real Estate Market&#13;
36.   The project will develop rules and procedures to enable private developers&#13;
awarded a Convention de Concession d'Amenagement to use it as security to obtain from&#13;
banking and financial institutions, loans to help meet their financing needs. As already&#13;
mentioned in para 23 and 28, model contracts of various types will also be drafted with&#13;
the project support.&#13;
37.   Under the project, a number of cases will be surveyed and analyzed, and&#13;
recommendations on tax exemptions for housing loans will be made. Similarly, an&#13;
analysis will be carried out of the likely impact of other possible exemptions (e.g. of&#13;
VAT, BIC) on real estate promotion, and recommendations will be submitted&#13;
accordingly. The cost of this project subcomponent (see Matrix: measures #14-15) is&#13;
estimated at US$ 100,000.&#13;
5. Stimulating Housing Savings&#13;
38.   The project will study the possibility of granting tax exemptions for borrowers on&#13;
the interests paid on SRH-refinanced housing loans, and of exempting SRH from BIC.&#13;
Also, after a careful review of the possible impact of such exemptions, recommendations&#13;
will be submitted as deemed appropriate on exemptions for revenues from bonds issued&#13;
by SRH, and for interest paid on housing savings accounts. The cost of this project&#13;
subcomponent (see Matrix: measure #16) is estimated at US$ 90,000.&#13;
D. The Capacity Building Program&#13;
39.   Background. Even after the Government has implemented legislative, regulatory&#13;
and institutional reforms giving new responsibilities to housing sector operators, the&#13;
Administration will still need to be the arbitrator. The State will not invest large amounts&#13;
of public funds in housing anymore, but it will continue playing a regulatory role and&#13;
ensuring that rules are understood by all the parties involved. It will also have to impose&#13;
sanctions occasionally to limit abuses that might result from a new freedom in real estate&#13;
transactions. Charts of sector performance will be developed -- based on performance&#13;
indicators -- for savings and investment, real estate market, the impact of taxation on the&#13;
level of investments, the fluidity of the market, and the success of Govermment agencies&#13;
in restructuring the land registration and development system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
1. Streamlining and Improving the Administration of Land Management&#13;
40.   Administrative services concerned with land management are distributed between&#13;
two ministries. Service du Domaine Urbain, Service de Z'Urbanisme and Service de la&#13;
Topographie, all responsible for managing land registered by the State, are part of the&#13;
Ministry of Housing. Direction du Domaine, du Cadastre, de 1'Enregistrement et du&#13;
Timbre (DCFHC), which guarantees private titles and assesses property taxes, is part of&#13;
the Ministry of Finance. The roles of these different services will be revisited and&#13;
redefined as deemed desirable in the context of the reforms undertaken. A preliminary&#13;
distribution of responsibilities -- to be confirmed under the project -- would be the&#13;
following: the role of Service du Domaine Urbain would be limited to the registration of&#13;
the land to the name of the State, and to overseeing the operation of AGEF. DCFHC&#13;
would remain the guarantor of property rights on plots purchased. Such changes should&#13;
have far reaching organizational consequences, -- including the transfer of Service du&#13;
Domaine Urbain to the Ministry of Finance. These will be examined in detail under the&#13;
project, and specific action plans will be developed accordingly (see Matrix: measure&#13;
#17). The cost of this project subcomponent is estimated at US$ 300,000.&#13;
41.   Under the project, three operations will be undertaken to support this&#13;
strengthening of the sector management. First, a prime data base will be established from&#13;
the documents of Service du Domaine Urbain, DCFHC and Bureau National d'Etudes&#13;
Techniques pour le Developpement (BNETD).  The data base will be used by&#13;
policymakers, by all administrative departments involved in land management and by&#13;
developers, and will facilitate the transfer of land (see Matrix: measure #18). Second, a&#13;
public information campaign targeting households and other groups -- e.g. professionals,&#13;
associations -- will be undertaken (see Matrix: measure #19) with the participation of the&#13;
actors concerned with the sectoral strategy. Third, a Real Estate Guide will be developed&#13;
and will be one of the main instrument in the information campaign (see Matrix: measure&#13;
# 20). Estimates are that these operations will cost in total US$ 1.0 million (0.1, 0.8 and&#13;
0.1 respectively).&#13;
2. Broadening the Tax Base&#13;
42.   The project will help rationalize procedures for assessing taxes on land and on&#13;
properties, by using surveys to determine benchmark premises (by zone, category of&#13;
housing, etc.). Such rationalization of procedures should lead to a substantial increase of&#13;
revenues from land and real estate taxation; estimates are that the tax return from&#13;
properties which would be registered in a simplified way (see para 24) could be in the&#13;
vicinity of CFAF 17 billion per year. The project will support the review of taxes on real&#13;
estate registration and transfers and the development of related recommendations. The&#13;
project will also finance the implementation of a computerized system for real estate&#13;
taxation purposes (see Matrix: measures #21-22). The cost of this project subcomponent&#13;
is estimated at US$ 190,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
3. Upgrading the Management of Community Housing Developments&#13;
43.   The existing housing stock in C6te d'Ivoire, especially housing built by parastatal&#13;
companies, is deteriorating rapidly because of the lack of maintenance of buildings and&#13;
open spaces. In order to encourage implementation of a uniform system for managing&#13;
community housing developments, the project will finance a qualitative survey of a&#13;
sample of 200 Abidjan households living in SOGEFIHA and SICOGI housing&#13;
developments (which number 40,000 units); see Matrix; measure #23. The cost of this&#13;
project subcomponent is estimated at US$ 100,000.&#13;
4. Providing Training and Specialized Professional Advice&#13;
44.   To promote a broader knowledge of urban development planning and law, the&#13;
project will provide professional and research training on a variety of subjects and, in&#13;
particular, on urban and real estate laws (see Matrix: measure #24), addressing general as&#13;
well as specialized topics for the benefit inter alia of concerned professionals who wish&#13;
to improve their trade.  Advice will also be provided under the project for the&#13;
development, the organization and the supervision of the land developer profession. The&#13;
cost of the professional services involved in these supports is estimated at US$ 270,000.&#13;
5. StrengtheningProject Management&#13;
45.   To achieve the project objectives, an efficient coordination of all parties involved&#13;
in these reforms will be needed. For that purpose, three small Technical Units will be&#13;
established in each of the ministries primarily concerned: Housing, Finance and Justice.&#13;
The activities of these Units will be supervised by a Coordination Unit.  The&#13;
Coordination Unit will act as the project implementation agency; it will prepare the&#13;
decisions of, and report to the Housing Steering Committee (HSC), chaired by the&#13;
Minister of Housing and composed of the other Ministers concerned. A Coordinator has&#13;
been designated by the Government to manage the Coordination Unit. Recommendations&#13;
to the HSC will stem from the analysis and monitoring of various data (inter alia land&#13;
registration; inventories of allocation notices, undeveloped land, sites developed but not&#13;
built) managed by the agencies responsible.  Under the project, equipment and&#13;
operational support will be provided for the Coordination Unit, as well as technical&#13;
assistance to the Technical Units. Cost estimates for this project subcomponent are US$&#13;
1.8 million.&#13;

I. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION&#13;
46.   The three Ministries involved in the preparation of the reform package -- Housing,&#13;
Finance and Justice -- will be responsible for overall program coordination and project&#13;
execution, through the Housing Steering Committee (HSC ) chaired by the Minister of&#13;
Housing. The HSC will meet at least once a month and its decisions will be prepared by&#13;
a Coordination Unit, on the basis of dossiers prepared by the three Technical Units&#13;
established in each of the Ministries concerned. The intenministerial order establishing&#13;
HSC, the Coordination Unit and the Technical units was taken as a condition of Board&#13;
presentation and its promulgation in the Journal Officiel will be a condition of Credit&#13;
effectiveness. The Ministries, through their respective Technical Units, will be&#13;
responsible for implementing the project in their respective areas of prerogative. AGEF&#13;
will not be able to take immediately full responsibility for the implementation of some of&#13;
the pilot operations and will, therefore, delegate temporarily this responsibility to the&#13;
Ministries of Housing and Finance. All agencies, following conventional procurement&#13;
procedures, will commission consulting firms and general contractors to design the&#13;
operations, execute the works and supervise the contractors. The Coordination Unit will&#13;
facilitate communication between the Technical Units, provide advice on procurement,&#13;
supervise contractual arrangements, administer disbursements and prepare project&#13;
progress reports on the basis of progress status notes prepared by the Technical Units. In&#13;
summary, individual agencies will be responsible for implementing the various project&#13;
components, as set out in the following Table.&#13;
Components:                           Implementing Aenies,&#13;

47.   A Project Implementation Manual, acceptable to ITF, should be completed as a&#13;
condition of effectiveness. A draft detailed implementation plan for the first year and the&#13;
related budget, acceptable to ITF, was prepared and the adoption of a final version of&#13;
these plan and budget will be a condition of effectiveness. Thereafter, activity plans and&#13;
related budgets will be prepared each year and submitted no later than October 31 to ITF&#13;
for comment and approval. The project should be completed in December 31, 2000 and&#13;
the Credit should close on June 30, 2001.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
48.   A series of progress indicators have been identified and agreed upon with the&#13;
Government (Table 2). A first set of indicators refers to the adopted implementation&#13;
schedule. The other set pertains to the progress achieved in adopting the policy measures&#13;
expected as part of the reform, in making theses measures effective, and in generating the&#13;
changes sought under the reform program.&#13;
49.   A mid-term review will be conducted about eighteen months after effectiveness&#13;
and no later than December 31, 1998. The review will assess progress in implementing&#13;
the project and determine what changes, if any, should be made. The review will include&#13;
an assessment of the impact of the land management and housing finance reform&#13;
programs, and a detailed assessment of the pilot operations. The Government, ITF and&#13;
CFD will discuss the actions needed to mitigate negative impacts. Based on the results of&#13;
the pilot operations, the Government is expected to confirm its plans for the&#13;
generalization of the reform program. Following the review of the Government's reform&#13;
plans and the feasibility of the institutions to be established under the project (Land&#13;
Management Agency, Secondary Mortgage Financing Facility and Guarantee Fund), ITF&#13;
will determine the extent of its support for the remainder of the project.&#13;

51.   The detail of project costs and financing is presented in Table 1. The opening by&#13;
the Government of a Project Account for funneling its contribution to project financing&#13;
and the crediting of an initial amount (CFAF 300 million) to this account would be&#13;
conditions of Credit effectiveness. Proceeds of the ITF Credit used to prefinance pilot&#13;
operations, once recovered from beneficairies, will be credited to AGEF as a contribution&#13;
to its operating resources.&#13;

54.   Equipment valued at less than US$ 100,000 equivalent, and not exceeding US$&#13;
400,000 equivalent in the aggregate, will be procured through national shopping&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA. For goods valued at more than US$ 100,000 equivalent&#13;
and less than US$ 200,000 equivalent, and not exceeding US$ 500,000 equivalent in the&#13;
aggregate, will be procured through national competitive bidding using standard bidding&#13;
documents approved by IDA. No contract for goods in excess of US$ 200,000 is&#13;
anticipated.  (If such a need were to materialize during project implementation,&#13;
international competitive bidding using IDA-issued standard bidding documents will be&#13;
required). Prior review will be required for all competitive bid contracts.&#13;
55.   Consultants' services will be procured according to related IDA guidelines dated&#13;
January 1997. Procurement will be carried out by the Technical Units as needed. Draft&#13;
terms of reference for the major consulting contracts to be financed under the project&#13;
have already been prepared; they will be finalized following discussions with ITF and&#13;
will be available in the Project File and attached to the Project Implementation Manual.&#13;
IDA's standard consultant contract forms, including a short-form letter for direct&#13;
contracting of individual consultants for short-term assignments, will be used. Due to&#13;
the particular focus of the proposed project, highly specialized expertise will be needed&#13;
for a number of advisory missions (i.e. as regards SRH) and, therefore, a significant&#13;
number of related contracts will be passed on a consultants' qualifications basis.&#13;
Similarly, other support needed under the project (e.g. to help establish AGEF) will call&#13;
for consultants with an extensive first-hand experience in comparable undertakings, and&#13;
such services will be sought from individual consultants. Consultant contracts with&#13;
individuals in excess of US$ 50,000 equivalent and with firms in excess of US$ 100,000&#13;
equivalent (essentially related to the pilot operations) will be subject to prior ITF review.&#13;
IV. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
56.   The project is expected to be disbursed over a four-year period. Disbursements&#13;
should be significant in the first phase of project implementation since the project&#13;
comprises a number of sub-components for which draft terms of reference are available&#13;
and contracts could be awarded in the first few quarters of project implementation.&#13;
Comparatively, other sub components -- e. g. that related to the establishment of SRH --&#13;
are likely to come to maturity at some significantly later date, as they involve participants&#13;
(e.g., commercial banks) that will need more time to come to closure on their&#13;
participation.&#13;
57.   ITF funds will be disbursed against the percentages shown in the Table below,&#13;
which are consistent with IDA practices under comparable technical assistance projects.&#13;
58.   Disbursements will be administered by the Coordination Unit on the basis of the&#13;
documentation prepared by the Technical Units. To facilitate project implementation:&#13;
(a) the Government will establish a Project Account through which its contribution will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
be made available by regular replenishment, based on the plan of action and related&#13;
budget forecast; and (b) a Special Account in CFAF will be opened in Caisse Autonome&#13;
d'Amortissement (CAA). The Special Account will be used for eligible expenditures&#13;
below US$ 100,000. The authorized allocation will amount to CFAF 600 million and&#13;
will cover about four months of eligible expenditures. Upon Credit effectiveness, CFAF&#13;
300 million, representing 50 percent of the authorized allocation, will be deposited into&#13;
the Special Account; the balance will be made available when needed as established by&#13;
the annual budget(s) submitted to ITF for comment.&#13;

59.   The Special Account will be replenished on the basis of withdrawal applications&#13;
fully documented except for: (a) contracts amounting to less than US$ 100,000 equivalent&#13;
for civil works, equipment and consulting firms' services; (b) contracts of less than US$&#13;
50,000 equivalent for individual consultants' services; and (c) operating costs which may&#13;
be claimed on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs).  All supporting&#13;
documentation will be retained and reviewed periodically by ITF supervision missions&#13;
and external auditors.&#13;
60.   Retroactive financing -- up to a limit of DTS 730,000, equivalent to 10 percent of&#13;
the proposed amount of the Credit -- will cover the costs of eligible consultants' services&#13;
incurred after January 1, 1997.&#13;
V. ACCOUNTING, AUDITING AND REPORTING&#13;
61.   The maintenance of records and the preparation of accounts and progress reports&#13;
will be carried out by the Coordination Unit with the support of the Technical units. One&#13;
full-time professional, the Accountant in the Coordination Unit will be responsible for&#13;
maintaining records and preparing accounts. His appointment -- as well as that of the&#13;
Lawyer and the Procurement officer in the Coordination Unit  will be a condition of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
Credit effectiveness -- The project accounts, the Special Account and the statements of&#13;
expenditure will be audited each year by independent auditors satisfactory to IDA. The&#13;
audit report will be provided to ITF within six months of the end of the financial year.&#13;
Audited financial statements prepared by auditors acceptable to ITF will also be provided&#13;
to ITF and the HSC. Terms of reference for the work of the auditors have been agreed&#13;
upon and are available in the Project File. The adoption of an accounting and financial&#13;
management system and the appointment of auditors, both acceptable to ITF, will be&#13;
conditions of Credit effectiveness.&#13;
62.   A full progress report will be prepared and submitted to ITF semi-annually, on&#13;
April 30 and October 31 at the latest. The report will detail all project and related&#13;
activities, report on progress against agreed upon schedules, and identify any problems&#13;
that may have been encountered and that could adversely affect the overall impact of the&#13;
project. The reports will also compare actual performance with target performance&#13;
indicators, using a range of performance monitoring indicators presented in Table 2.&#13;
Each of the Technical Units will provide information to the Coordination Unit in a&#13;
regular manner so that its reports can be prepared in a timely fashion. The format and&#13;
content of the reports, and the responsibilities of each Unit in relation to the report, are&#13;
detailed in the Project Implementation Manual. For several indicators, specific targets&#13;
have been identified. For others, base line data are not currently available. An early task&#13;
under the project will be to identify base lines so that realistic targets at different dates&#13;
can be determined.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Urban Land Management and Housing
            Finance Reforms Technical Assistance Project will support
            the detailed definition and beginning of implementation of a
            reform package for improving the efficiency and equity of
            urban land and housing markets. Specifically, it will: (i)
            promote the development of a market for the provision of
            serviced land and housing, especially to moderate and low
            income households; (ii) foster private investment in
            housing; and (iii) strengthen the capacity of public and
            private sector institutions involved in the development and
            management of urban land and housing delivery. The project
            will support pilot operations in land titling, management
            and development, as well as, data management. The project
            consist of three components: a) land management reform,
            namely i) creating and launching the Agence de Gestion
            Fonciere (AGEF), ii) developing through concession, iii)
            reducing development costs, iv) clearing the titling
            backlog, and v) privatizing public real state; b) housing
            finance reform by i) creating and launching the Societe de
            Refinancement Hypothecaire (SRH), ii) creating a security
            fund, iii) enforcing foreclosures, iv) stimulating the real
            state market, and v) stimulating housing savings; and c)
            capacity building consisting of i) land management support
            operations, ii) tax base management, iii) public housing
            management, iv) develop professional and research training
            at the University on Urban and Real Estate Law, and v)
            promote the organization of the developers' profession.
