ber 1999, which was attended by many indepen-&#13;

sponsored by the WSP and the World Bank&#13;
Institute, with funding from The Netherlands and&#13;
Belgium and dissemination funds from Germany&#13;
(GTZ). The countries covered were Benin, Burkina&#13;
Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Guinea, Kenya, Mali,&#13;
Mauritania, Uganda, Senegal, and Tanzania. In&#13;
each of these countries, local private consultants&#13;
(with methodological support from Hydroconseil&#13;
and IRC) gathered information about independent&#13;
water and sanitation operators and brought them&#13;
into contact with one another, in order to increase&#13;
knowledge and understanding of their roles and&#13;
needs. The individual city reports may also be&#13;
obtained from the country survey leaders and from&#13;
the West Africa Regional Water and Sanitation&#13;
Group (see end of report for contact information).&#13;
This report consolidates the results of the ten&#13;
city studies and seeks to answer the big questions&#13;
about independent water and sanitation providers:&#13;
*   How do they provide water service in&#13;
areas where city water authorities and concession-&#13;
aires hesitate to invest?&#13;
*   How important are the services they&#13;
supply-how many households do they serve, how&#13;
many people do they employ, and what is the&#13;
volume of their business?&#13;
*   How do they finance their investments in&#13;
an infrastructure-intensive sector of business?&#13;
*   What kinds of relationships do they have&#13;
with local authorities and with large water&#13;
producers, both public and private?&#13;
*   What are their main advantages, what&#13;
obstacles do they face in seeking to expand their&#13;
activities or improve the quality of service, and&#13;
what policies would be likely to improve their&#13;
services and benefit the low-income urban&#13;
consumers they serve?&#13;

Another important clientele for the carters and&#13;
water tank truckers is middle- and upper-income&#13;
households who are not getting the water they&#13;
need from the piped network, either because the&#13;
network has not reached their area or because&#13;
there are frequent service interruptions.&#13;

It is easier for independent private operators to&#13;
offer a wide variety of services adapted to diverse&#13;
consumer needs because they are free of the&#13;
contract conditions facing the city-wide water&#13;
companies, conditions based on an industrialized&#13;
city model. Private operators are free to serve low-&#13;
income residents who are the designated target&#13;
population of the Water and Sanitation Program,&#13;
along with middle- and upper-income house-&#13;
holds-whose homes, including luxury villas, may&#13;
be located in areas beyond the piped network. In&#13;
fact, a good part of the independent providers'&#13;
income comes from more prosperous households;&#13;
high-income families are the principal clientele of&#13;
the water truckers in Nairobi, who also charge&#13;

Most households in African cities-70 to 90&#13;
percent overall, and virtually all poor house-&#13;
holds-deal with their own waste by building their&#13;

houses can also build a latrine at the same time,&#13;

A group of young people managing a standpipe in Dakar&#13;
A group of 30 young people from the Fcnss Delorme neighborhood in Dakar got together and&#13;
created a cultural association. In order to earn money, they built a standpipe with funds put up by a&#13;
local leader and had it connected to the water company mains. The group's members take turns&#13;
manning the standpipe and invest most of their profits in equipment they use to start other money-&#13;
making ventures (sound system, video camera).&#13;
Madame Kabor6, a hand carter in Ouagadougou&#13;
For the past four years, Madame Kabore, who is 37 years old and mother of four children, has&#13;
worked 12 hours a day as a hand carter. Her husband bought her the cart with his own money. She&#13;
buys water at US$0.10 for a 200-liter barrel and sells at three or four times cost (200 to 300 percent&#13;
markup). She sells on average seven barrels a day, which brings in about US$2 a day, enough to&#13;
feed her fomily.&#13;
Sidi Ould Amor, owner-operator of a donkey cart in Nouakchott&#13;
Sidi, now 25 and a bachelor, arrived in the city five years ago and started work as a hired cart&#13;
driver, a job his uncle found for him. In 1997, he was able to buy his own cart with a loan that has&#13;
since been repaid. He spends six months of the year delivering water in the city, and returns to his&#13;
village during the other half of the year in order to plow his fields and help other migrants do the same.&#13;
While in the city, he shares rented accommodations with other carters from the some region.&#13;
Private Network Investment in Dakar cnd Operators in Kampala&#13;
In Dakar, more than half the water distribution network has been built by independent private land&#13;
developers. Their private investment is automatically transferred to the national water authority,&#13;
SONES, with a promise of compensation.&#13;
In Kampala, private standpipe operators are managing small networks with several standpipes&#13;
serving an entire peri-urbon community, under contract to the water users' association that invested&#13;
in network extension. Because the water corporation, NWSC, discourages such extensions, five&#13;
wholly freestanding borehole networks have been built by Kalebu Limits, founded by an engineer&#13;
and his wife, a marketing speciolist. Stkrting with a single network, fed by water pumped from a well&#13;
with an electric motor, they financed the second one from the profits on the first. The company also&#13;
manages a group of eight coin-operated standpipes connected to the city network.&#13;

Suction truckers clean latrine and septic pits for 10   easier to study. This is why some sanitation sector&#13;
to 1 5 percent of households in the two cities  studies cover only this type of service and not the&#13;
studied, mostly relatively well-off households. The  manual cleaners, who nonetheless do the lion's&#13;
cost is not much more than that of manual       share of the work. The suction truckers use their&#13;

In Dakar's Fass Delorme district, a two-man pick-and-shovel team&#13;
Teamwork lightens the workload for this pair, whose regular customers include about a thousand&#13;
residents clustered around the hundred-odd courtyards of this small district, plus the occasional client&#13;
from outside who has heard about their work by word of mouth. They also do some drain cleaning&#13;
as a sideline, and do a lot of business repairing caved-in or damaged latrines.&#13;
Clients hire them for two types of service: annual pit emptying for about CFAF 15,000 for an 8 cubic&#13;
meter pit, or a partial digout for CFAF 3,000 every two or three months.&#13;
Waste is generally reburied on-site, if there is room and the courtyard is unpaved, or in the roadway&#13;
nearby, which gives rise to protests from the neighbors and sometimes a visit from the municipal&#13;
sanitation authorities. But this pair usually escapes any penalty by taking the fellows out for a drink.&#13;
In Bamoko, an economic interest group (GIE) operates two suction trucks&#13;
The Sema Saniya GIE operates a number of sanitation business ventures. They began with the&#13;
collection and sorting of household waste for resale and recycling and then added the sale of trash&#13;
cans, operation of a public toilet and shower facility at the main troin station, and septic and latrine&#13;
pit emptying.&#13;
In July 1995, they bought a second-hand suction truck with a CFAF 10 million grant from ACCT&#13;
(Cultural and Technical Cooperation Agency) . Within two years, the success of this operation&#13;
convinced them to buy a second truck, using CFAF 6 million of their own earnings and a CFAF 5&#13;
million loan from BMCD (Malian Bank of Development Credit), which they reimbursed within a year.&#13;
Business is still booming and there are plans for the purchase of a third truck in 1 999.&#13;
Sema Saniya's customers are mostly individual households, who pay CFAF 8,500-15,000 in cash for&#13;
a complete pit emptying; the price varies with the distance the truck must travel. A significant number&#13;
of clients are referred by agents called coxers (after the English term for coxing a sculling crew) who&#13;
receive a commission for each successful referral.&#13;
EMAPROHY, a rapidly expanding suction truck business in Bamako&#13;
The founder of EMAPROHY started work as a construction worker. Seeing the heavy demand for&#13;
septic tank cleaning, he bought a suction truck in 1991. He has reinvested his profits and now&#13;
operates four trucks. Since 1995, he expanded his business into the construction area, which now&#13;
accounts for two-thirds of his annual turnover.&#13;

Sludge Disposal and Treatment&#13;
Though proper disposal and treatment of waste&#13;
from latrines and septic pits is crucial to protect the&#13;
environment and public health, there is little&#13;
market demand for this type of service. House-&#13;
holds are interested only in getting the sludge out&#13;
of the pit and off the plot, whether two meters or&#13;
two miles away, and are not inclined to pay&#13;
cleaners for waste treatment. There are therefore&#13;
few independent providers who have specialized&#13;
in such work. Municipal or national public&#13;
authorities operate sludge dumps and pretreat-&#13;
ment facilities in Dakar, Abidjan and Kampala,&#13;
and subsidize the operating losses. Only in&#13;
Cotonou has a private operator set up a pretreat-&#13;
ment facility (SIBEAU). Municipal authorities were&#13;
then able to set fairly rigorous sanitation policy&#13;
and have also required trucks to dispose of septic&#13;
sludge at this facility. The operator receives no&#13;
subsidies and the cost is recovered from the&#13;
truckers and passed on to households. But there is&#13;
still some competition from truckers who choose to&#13;
dump in unauthorized areas.&#13;

Kampala (Uganda) Cily Council simultaneously encourages-and discourages-private&#13;
management of public toilets&#13;
Three private operators signed contracts with the Kampala city government to provide municipal&#13;
public toilets. There is a high volume of business: in the city center, an eight-toilet facility is used by&#13;
70 persons an hour, eleven hours a day. But at the same time, the expansion of toilet facilities is&#13;
hindered by the high cost of repairing the existing facilities, the high cost of water delivered by the&#13;
water company (US$2 per cubic meter of water for a facility where 16 cubic meters is used per day&#13;
on average), and the imposition of a monthly municipal tax of US$1,000 after three years of operation.&#13;
And then there are the frequent cuts in water provision. The owner of one of the private operators,&#13;
KKM All Services Ltd., decided to rehabilitate a borehole near his facility in order to have access to&#13;
water supply from a more reliable source than the city network. He bought a pickup truck fitted with&#13;
a water tank to transport water from the borehole, and undertook to maintain the drains. He earns&#13;
about $15,000 a year from his business, 70 percent of whose clientele are poor households.&#13;

commercial bank credit could be expanded, the&#13;
savings in the cost of credit would be passed on to&#13;
their customers.&#13;
Exclusion from Public Works Contracts&#13;
Many independent entrepreneurs, including those&#13;
involved in the water and sanitation sector, would&#13;
like to be able to participate in bidding for civil&#13;
works contracts to extend piped networks or to&#13;
build pits and tanks, and for service contracts to&#13;
collect sludge or clean drainage ditches. They are&#13;
kept from participating by the large size of job&#13;
lots, sometimes so large that they can be handled&#13;
only by a few large national or international&#13;
enterprises, and sometimes by backroom deals&#13;
between a few large contractors and the civil&#13;
servants awarding the contracts.&#13;
Lack of access to this market marginalizes the&#13;
small contractors because such public contracts,&#13;
especially externally financed ones, make up the&#13;
lion's share of work in the sector-more than 80&#13;
percent. The lack of competition in bidding hurts&#13;
not only the independent operators but also the&#13;
consumers and those paying for the works, since it&#13;
results in higher costs for works and services.&#13;
Unprotected Investment&#13;
Independent providers must be careful to limit their&#13;
risks by undertaking only short-term investments&#13;
that can be recouped in a short time, generally&#13;
less than two years. They do this not out of a lack&#13;
of professionalism, but deliberately and out of&#13;
necessity, in order to protect their investment. For&#13;
example,&#13;

Mali's Water Advisory Unit (CCAEP)&#13;
Mali's Water Advisory Unit (Cellule de conseil aux adductions d'eau potable, or CCAEP), sponsored&#13;
by the Water Ministry beginning in 1994, offers to member Water Users' Associations in Mali's&#13;
towns a number of financial, management, and training services in exchange for a fee of CFAF 20&#13;
for each cubic meter of water distributed by the association. The fees, which amounted to CFAF&#13;
16,486,940 (about US$30,000) in 1998, go towards covering the unit's operating costs.&#13;
Services offered include&#13;
* semiannual financial audits of operating accounts,&#13;
* advisory services for equipment and infrastructure maintenance and repair, ensured by daily&#13;
radio contact,&#13;
* accounting and technical training for association officers, and&#13;
* regular communication among the member associations and between association officers and the&#13;
unit's own governing board.&#13;
This arrangement has been very successful, resulting in a steady reduction of unit operating costs by&#13;
about half over a five-year period from about US$0.70 per cubic meter to about US$0.30. The&#13;
reduction in unit costs of about US$ 0.30 per cubic meter amounts to about six times the unifs fee.&#13;
The source of these savings has been primarily economies of scale through expansion of production,&#13;
but also better management of both costs and water stocks.&#13;
CCAEP also provides the Water Ministry with a self-financing means of monitoring water operations&#13;
in these towns. The unit collects data on a number of indicators, such as per capita water consump-&#13;
tion, unit production costs (per cubic meter of water), cost of fuel per unit produced, and gross profit,&#13;
allowing it to identify towns where there appear to be problems or deficits.&#13;
With the creation of local authorities planned for 1999, CCAEP's audits will form the basis of&#13;
contractual relationships to be established between the users' associations and the local authorities,&#13;
and between the local authorities and the Water Ministry. The audits will constitute an powerful&#13;
decision-making tool for&#13;
* regulating water service and establishing fair prices for the consumer and a fair return for the&#13;
operator,&#13;
* resolving any disputes between the local authorities and the water operator,&#13;
* motivating operators to improve performance to match or exceed their peers, and&#13;
* keeping consumers informed about the performance of their local water operators.&#13;
The availability of comparable data from a credibly independent agency also encourages competi-&#13;
tion and ensures transparency, a factor required to attract participation by existing independent&#13;
providers in other markets where such a unit might be established.&#13;

            Independent water and sanitation providers
            in African cities - full report of a ten-country study
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The report comprises ten country studies
            in Africa, providing a wealth of information on a vibrant,
            independent water, and sanitation sector that responds to
            market niches, and meets the needs of both the poor, and
            other underserved communities, on a very broad scale. The
            cases further indicate that independent providers are
            creatively tackling the challenge of water, and sanitation
            service delivery, in a variety of ways, and may be the only
            option for many poor urban households. Interestingly enough,
            the entrance of large-scale private operators into the
            water, and sanitation sector, has brought about a renewed
            interest among small-scale private operators. The study
            argues that sector decision makers should be aware that:
            independent providers are part of the solution to providing
            water, and sanitation services to a growing urban
            population, and, that policy does matter in getting
            independent providers to maximize their potential to service
            the poor, to the benefit of all. Conclusions suggest that
            competition is a better way to ensure fair rates, and
            services, rather than administrative supervision; that
            independent providers offer well-adapted services in
            unplanned urban areas; and, that recognition of, and respect
            for independent operators may be conducive to new sources of
            energy, financing, and sustainability.
