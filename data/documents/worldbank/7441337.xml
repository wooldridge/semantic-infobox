LINKING INDIVIDUAL, ORGANIZATIONAL, AND INSTITUTIONAL&#13;
CAPACITY BUILDING TO RESULTS&#13;
By Vinod Thomas, Director-General, Independent Evaluation Group&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
   Achieving rapid development calls for improved capacity in the public and private sectors to support&#13;
   development policies and projects. The World Bank recognizes that capacity building is a long-term pro-&#13;
   cess requiring a systemic approach. That is why many Bank projects in Africa and elsewhere include&#13;
   capacity development activities. But three drawbacks have limited the effectiveness of these efforts:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   · Many operations do not--but need to--take an integrated view of solutions involving the individual,&#13;
       organizational, and institutional contexts.&#13;
   · Individual, organizational, and institutional links vary greatly across sectors; not addressing these&#13;
       differences has led to less effective capacity building.&#13;
   · Capacity goals as they relate to this understanding of the individual, organizational, and institutional&#13;
       aspects have not been explicit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   This Capacity Brief discusses and illustrates the importance of integrating capacity-building efforts at all&#13;
   three levels, addressing differences among sectors in their integration, while setting forth explicit capacity&#13;
   goals and monitoring and evaluating progress toward them.&#13;

solution to building human capacity. For example, low&#13;
salaries and poor working conditions often contribute&#13;
to high outflow of trained staff. More important, the&#13;

  An important consideration in the overall effective-&#13;
ness of capacity building then is:&#13;
                                                          programs are seen within the context of larger insti-&#13;

     average of about $11,000 each and usually take from four&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Achieving rapid development calls for
            improved capacity in the public and private sectors to
            support development policies and projects. The World Bank
            recognizes that capacity building is a long-term process
            requiring a systemic approach. That is why many Bank
            projects in Africa and elsewhere include capacity
            development activities. But three drawbacks have limited the
            effectiveness of these efforts: many operations do not --
            but need to -- take an integrated view of solutions
            involving the individual, organizational, and institutional
            contexts; individual, organizational, and institutional
            links vary greatly across sectors -- not addressing these
            differences has led to less effective capacity building; and
            capacity goals as they relate to this understanding of the
            individual, organizational, and institutional aspects have
            not been explicit. This Capacity Brief discusses and
            illustrates the importance of integrating capacity-building
            efforts at all three levels, and addressing differences
            among sectors in their integration, while setting forth
            explicit capacity goals and monitoring and evaluating
            progress toward them.
