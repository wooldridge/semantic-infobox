&#13;
This working paper reviews the first decade (2001-11) of                                       thorough understanding of what has driven the successes&#13;
Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s pioneering private sector participation (PSP) model                                   achieved, and why challenges remain. Among the key&#13;
for small town water supply. The number of towns under                                         achievements of the Ugandan small town PSP approach,&#13;
the PSP model has steadily risen from only 15 in 2001-02                                       the following deserve particular attention:&#13;
to over 90 in 2010-11 with a combined population of over                                          â&#128;¢	 Connections expanded: Connections in the 19 towns&#13;

Uganda, and to inform other countries considering similar                                            4,883 to over 13,000 in 2010-11. This expansion of&#13;
PSP approaches.                                                                                      connections has been partially driven by the private&#13;
                                                                                                     sector, with a key role also played by public subsidies&#13;
The core idea behind PSP centered reform in Uganda was                                               that are an essential part of the Ugandan PSP&#13;

a decrease of investments through short-term profit taking;                                          successfully collected by POs. Unfortunately,&#13;

      repairs; thus they have a direct incentive to minimize                        at a fair price. With its history of reforms and seasoned&#13;
      staff and maintenance expenditures as much as                                 sector practitioners, Uganda is well placed to tackle these&#13;

      disincentivizing maintenance and investments that&#13;
      do not pay off within three years. The sector should                          In doing so, it is encouraging to recognize that progress in&#13;

      model of contracting each scheme individually                                 for POs to raise private finance. Likewise, asset registries&#13;
      leads to inefficient overhead costs for operators who                         will make it easier to develop contracts that better account&#13;
      find themselves managing geographically dispersed                             for hardware depreciation and improving capacity locally&#13;
      schemes. It is also suboptimal from the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s                          will relieve pressure for auditing from the center.&#13;

According to the new Ugandan Water&#13;
Supply Atlas (WATSUP 2011), and&#13;
including the above 105 small town piped&#13;
systems, Uganda boasts a total of over 700&#13;
piped schemes not managed by the NWSC.&#13;

Private Operators&#13;
In fiscal year 2010-11, Uganda had 18&#13;
different private water operators (that is,&#13;
private companies) operating small town&#13;
piped systems under active contract with&#13;
local Water Supply and Sewerage Boards.8&#13;
Of these, 10 POs managed at least two or&#13;
more systems. All but four have head offices&#13;
in Kampala, and usually offer broader                                                      In total, the 88 systems for which the self-reported&#13;

words, the operators are typically not pure, specialized water                             including technicians, accountants, cashiers, guards and so&#13;
system management firms. Note that some town councils,                                     on. The average system is staffed with approximately five&#13;
especially those with small systems, hire private individuals                              employees. However, this data is self-reported by POs, and&#13;
rather than firms to oversee their networks. This is also                                  the reported number of staff may not attend to a system&#13;

    For instance, given that power costs are to be paid directly                        received over US$300 per month in power subsidies in the&#13;

    electricity costs would justify excessively high operator&#13;
    fees and thus increase actual over reported profits. The                            As can be seen on Map 1, some operators have managed to&#13;
    variations in self-reported costs (for example, electricity cost                    cluster their systems in certain regions by winning individual&#13;

    them to better carry out their supervisory duties. Due to&#13;
    the relatively high turnover of WSSB members, and the&#13;
    considerable skill gap between these and the operators, this&#13;
    remains an area of concern.&#13;

    Support Institutions&#13;
    The POs thus manage systems in a well-defined contractual&#13;
    framework. The institutional relationships and central role&#13;
    of the MoWE outlined above, however, do not fully describe&#13;
    the Ugandan PSP model, which is further complemented&#13;
    by a number of private, state- and donor-funded support&#13;
    institutions. These have emerged to provide additional&#13;
    capacity and assistance to local governments and private&#13;
    operators. In addition to support provided directly from&#13;
    MoWE units, the four most important support institutions&#13;
    are the Water and Sanitation Development Facilities&#13;
    (WSDF), the Umbrella Organizations and the APWO.&#13;
&#13;
    The Water and Sanitation Development Facilities&#13;
    The WSDFs are the primary funding and implementation&#13;
    mechanism of the MoWE for major rehabilitations and&#13;
    new system constructions. The WSDFs are regionally&#13;
    organized, employing trained engineers and managers.&#13;
    Their key purpose is to compensate for the inadequate&#13;
    capacity of local governments to plan and implement major&#13;
    investments. Overall accounting responsibilities for the&#13;
    WSDF lies with the Ministry, but WSDF branches operate&#13;
    with a considerable degree of independence.                                               however, is entirely through the Government of Uganda&#13;

in urban areas by 2014-15, including small towns.27 The                                          Table 8: Estimated Funding Needs, Expenditure and&#13;
                                                                                                 Funding Gap (FY10â&#128;&#147;11)&#13;
2009 Strategic Sector Investment Plan (SSIP) recognized&#13;
this official target as â&#128;&#156;Scenario A,â&#128;&#157; but to be realistic in face&#13;
of â&#128;&#156;the present low level of fundingâ&#128;&#157; has also developed a&#13;
less ambitious â&#128;&#156;Scenario B.â&#128;&#157; Under Scenario B, the coverage&#13;
target for urban areas is to achieve 100 percent coverage&#13;
by 2035, but only 80 percent for large urban areas and 65&#13;
percent for small towns by 2015.28&#13;
&#13;
These national sector targets diverge from the international&#13;
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which are&#13;
defined as halving the percentage of the population&#13;
without access to safe water in 1990 by 2015. Based on&#13;
the household survey statistics compiled by the JMP, this&#13;
would imply an overall water sector target of 72 percent&#13;
by 2015.29 The MDGs do not officially set separate rural&#13;
and urban targets, but the implied values of these would&#13;
be 70 percent access in rural areas and 89 percent in urban&#13;
areas. Due to a lack of baseline statistics for access in small&#13;
towns in 1990, it is not possible to apply the MDG target&#13;
methodology to small towns in Uganda.&#13;
&#13;
Estimated Investment Requirements&#13;
The NDP which set the basic national targets provides some&#13;
investment guidance, but these estimates are limited and&#13;
now outdated, and do not specify financial requirements for&#13;
small towns.30 The key source for a comprehensive estimate&#13;
of investment requirements to reach national targets is the&#13;
SSIP (2009).&#13;
&#13;
As Table 8 highlights, the public funding shortfall relative&#13;
to SIP targets, even under the more realistic Scenario B, is at&#13;
least US$54 million (UGX135 billion) for the water sector&#13;
as a whole, of which US$37 million is in the urban sector,&#13;
and US$18 million in small towns. These figures mean that&#13;
the water and sanitation subsector is clearly underfunded                                        The recent second Country Status Overview report for&#13;
relative to the targets specified under both Scenario A and                                      the Ugandan water and sanitation sector did not estimate&#13;
B in the NDP and SSIP.                                                                           specific funding requirements for small town water supply.&#13;

     However, its estimates for the total sector capital investment                              Instead, the declining budget is due to sector ceilings in&#13;
     deficit was similar at US$73 million annually, with an urban                                the MTEF, that is, a political decision to prioritize other&#13;
     capital investment deficit of US$38 million annually.31                                     sectors. Even if donors were to increase funds to the sector,&#13;
                                                                                                 these would be offset by a reduction in government funding.&#13;
     As the SSIP envisages a progressive increase of funding over                                The relatively low funding allocation to water is motivated&#13;

     more decisive effort to stock-up funds is made. The budget                                  energy, health and education in the short- or medium-term.&#13;

&#13;
     The IFC and GPOBA Pilots: New Transmission                                          The necessity to prefinance led POs to seek out private&#13;
     Mechanisms                                                                          sources of credit. As described in the preceding section,&#13;
     In 2005, the MoWE cooperated with the GPOBA to                                      with the involvement of subsidies from international&#13;
     pilot a new, output-based aid model for greenfield small-                           institutions, the longer contract period, the higher fee&#13;
     town networks (design, build and operate) as well as the                            percentage and more flexible tariffs, at least two operators&#13;
     operation of selected existing brownfield small town                                managed to obtain a significant bank loan. Even in these&#13;
     schemes. Contracts for nine pilot towns were signed in                              special circumstances of the GPOBA pilots, however,&#13;
     2008-9. In addition to this first output-based aid pilot, the                       commercial loans were difficult to obtain for other POs&#13;
     IFC in 2007 signed a mandate to implement the Uganda                                who reverted to balance sheet financing and pushing their&#13;
     Small Scale Infrastructure Provider Water Program. In                               suppliers for prefinancing. This illustrates the challenges of&#13;
     June 2010, the IFC awarded the first contract for the town                          expanding the role of private credit in the Ugandan water&#13;
     of Busembatia to a private contractor, with the GPOBA                               sector in general, where conditions with shorter contracts,&#13;
     contributing the capital investment costs for the project.                          less supervision, less flexible tariffs and lower fees are&#13;
                                                                                         considerably less favorable for obtaining private credit.&#13;
     In both cases, the basic idea was to increase financial&#13;
     participation of private actors and to incentivize good                             While a thorough review of the GPOBA pilots is still&#13;
     performance by making reimbursement dependent on                                    outstanding, the contracted POs were still operating in&#13;
     outputs. In line with this goal, the contracts between                              all towns in 2010-11. An interim assessment of the first&#13;
     operators and Water Authorities differed from the standard                          GPOBA pilot project found significant efficiency gains,&#13;
     model. Contract duration was extended to five years in                              in particular, lower overall subsidies per new person given&#13;
     duration instead of the regular three, typically also allowing                      access, better payment efficiency, and lower transaction&#13;
     operators a higher percentage of revenues to compensate                             costs. Some of these effects, however, may be due to the&#13;
     for their prefinancing risk and a tariff level that priced in                       high-profile technical support by international partners and&#13;
     some of the investment costs (usually tariffs are set only to                       the involvement of a private fiduciary agent.&#13;
     cover O&amp;M). The POs were also partially reimbursed for                              In spite of a generally favorable perception of the pilots,&#13;
     prefinanced investments after targeted yard-tap and public                          a scale-up has not been implemented so far. For this to&#13;
     stand-post connection targets were met and independently                            happen, POs would need better access to private finance&#13;
     verified. For the first pilot, the Ministry of Finance provided                     than is currently the case, a sustainable equivalent to the&#13;
     an exemption from the sector ceiling and allowed a private                          private verification agent would have to be found, and&#13;
     fiduciary agent (PricewaterhouseCoopers) to check quality                           transaction support to local authorities and POs would&#13;
     and quantity of outputs.                                                            need to increase. These issues touch on the key reforms&#13;
     While the standard framework of a chain of contractual                              which are discussed in greater detail in the final sections&#13;

     connections has remained fairly stable, with around 20                                      Interestingly, the percentage of nonrevenue water has&#13;

     The amount of water supplied has also risen and reached                                     illegal connections. Future auditors should keep in mind,&#13;

     Without clustering, POs face higher overhead costs from                                         The second advantage from the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s point of view&#13;
     a number of sources. First, internal management is more                                         would be a simplification of administration and supervision.&#13;
     expensive as managers have to travel far between the schemes                                    At present, over 90 management contracts are put out for&#13;
     to resolve problems. A particularly well known issue is the                                     tendering by local WSSBs in three-year cycles all across the&#13;
     requirement for the chief manager to sign for joint-escrow                                      country. It has proven extremely challenging to guarantee&#13;
     account expenditures as local officers generally do not have                                    an efficient, problem-free tendering process at the local&#13;
     signing power, causing considerable costs and delays. The                                       level, and subsequently supervise performance and enforce&#13;
     geographical dispersion also prevents an optimization of                                        management contracts.&#13;
     staffing across schemes, as technicians and accountants can&#13;
     often not be shared in an ideal way.&#13;
                                                                                                     Map 2: Distribution of Gazetted Small Town&#13;
     As illustrated in Map 2, in FY10-11 the PO Trandint Ltd.                                        Schemes (FY10-11)&#13;
     managed 14 schemes spread over a distance of over 1,500&#13;
     (road) kilometers, with over 100 kilometers between two&#13;
     schemes on average. The Trandint Ltd example also shows&#13;
     that operators have tended to counteract this problem by&#13;
     competing for contracts of schemes that are relatively close&#13;
     together, creating de-facto clusters. For example, as Map 2&#13;
     highlights, the Trandint Ltd. schemes form three de-facto&#13;
     clusters with only one major outlier. Similar â&#128;&#156;self-selected&#13;
     clustersâ&#128;&#157; are formed by some of the other operators, for&#13;
     example, Kagula MS in the north-west and center-east, or&#13;
     Jowa Ltd in central Uganda and WSS Ltd. In the south-&#13;
     west. However, these clusters are not stable as each contract&#13;
     must be competed for individually, and consequently they&#13;
     are interspersed and overlapped by other operators. This&#13;
     suggests that further efficiency gains are possible by creating&#13;
     larger, more stable, and more coherent clusters.&#13;
&#13;
     Clustering could have further advantages. First, operators                                      Note: Trandint Ltd. Has been highlighted&#13;
     tend to cherrypick well-performing schemes and disregard&#13;
     smaller, less profitable ones, which then fall back to public&#13;
     management (that is, run by town councils). In FY10-                                            While clustering would not reduce the number of systems,&#13;
     11, the systems managed by POs had almost 150 active                                            it would provide for a move towards fewer tenders and&#13;
     connections more on average than publicly run systems,                                          contracts. The reduced number and frequency of contracts,&#13;
     and also tended to be newer on average.53 Both indicators                                       and lower number of interlopers, would allow for a better&#13;
     point towards a self-selection of operators into inherently                                     preparation and supervision of contracts. However, it would&#13;
     more profitable schemes (that is, with better economies of                                      also raise the stakes by increasing the value of each contract.&#13;
     scale and lower repair costs). Well-planned clustering could                                    Clustering reform can only succeed if the associated&#13;
     gently counteract this by bundling some less attractive                                         tendering system is implemented with a high standard of&#13;
     schemes with more attractive ones and thus achieve cross-                                       transparency and supervision.&#13;

In spite of a seemingly broad agreement on the desirability                         to the point that over US$2 million in tariffs are collected&#13;
of clustering, no significant steps towards its realization                         annually and the average system can cover operating costs.&#13;

to the idea by local governments which oppose the idea of                           for reform described above. The interlinked nature of these&#13;
yielding control to regional or national authorities as may be                      reform opportunities implies that improving one area can&#13;

Stakeholders should realize, however, that basic forms                              also make raising private finance easier. This opportunity&#13;
of clustering could build on the existing framework, for                            for dynamic improvements should be seized with&#13;

could provide support for rehabilitations, extensions and                           The reforms proposed in this working paper center on&#13;
repairs to systems within clusters. Local Water Authorities                         fine-tuning the incentive framework within which POs&#13;
would remain in charge of day-to-day supervision of                                 work: extending contract durations to improve incentives&#13;
individual schemes within clusters, continue to contribute                          to invest; developing special loan programs to increase&#13;
to tariff setting, co-sign the local escrow account, and                            incentives to use private finance; improving regulatory&#13;
drive extensions and investments with the help of support                           control and auditing to reduce incentives to cheat and&#13;
institutions. With their key tasks and responsibilities intact,                     ensure alignment with public service provision goals, and&#13;
performance contracts between Water Authorities and the                             so on. A working incentive framework, however, requires a&#13;
Ministry should also be retained as a key tool to set targets                       strong, active, well-functioning public sector to design and&#13;
for local governments. Over time, realized efficiency gains                         enforce it.&#13;
may provide a strong enough argument to move to more                                The Ugandan experience thus shows that local POs can&#13;
comprehensive clustering schemes across districts.                                  be successfully engaged to manage public infrastructure&#13;
The key next step will be a clear political endorsement and                         in small towns. However, it also underlines the continued&#13;
the development of a detailed transition plan and pilot                             importance of the public sector. Private agents are rationally&#13;
in one region. While clustering may not be a short-term                             self-interested and it takes a well-functioning state to ensure&#13;
priority given the other challenges, it is a key reform in the                      that the technical, commercial, and financial resources of&#13;
medium and long-term, and should remain on the agenda.                              the private sector are deployed in a way that is mutually&#13;

Moving Forward                                                                      well-functioning PSP model is a symbiosis of public and&#13;

     The decentralized Ugandan system is a complex construct                                        Finally, there are two frequently referred to planning&#13;
     in which the names of equivalent councils differ between                                       units which fall into neither the â&#128;&#156;local governmentâ&#128;&#157; nor&#13;
     rural and urban areas. Moreover, administrative and local                                      administrative council category â&#128;&#148; these are the so called&#13;
     government units can have names that imply a clear                                             â&#128;&#156;town boardsâ&#128;&#157; and the smaller, more marginal â&#128;&#156;rural growth&#13;
     hierarchy, which may not exist in practice due to their very                                   centersâ&#128;&#157;. Neither of these is an independent body corporate,&#13;

            Private sector participation in the Ugandan
            water sector : a review of ten years of private management
            of small town water systems - sustainable services through
            domestic private sector participation
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This working paper reviews the first
            decade (2001-11) of Uganda's pioneering private sector
            participation (PSP) model for small town water supply. The
            number of towns under the PSP model has steadily risen from
            only 15 in 2001-02 to over 90 in 2010-11 with a combined
            population of over 1.5 million. In evaluating the impact of
            this development, this working paper aims to guide further
            reform within Uganda, and to inform other countries
            considering similar PSP approaches. The core idea behind PSP
            centered reform in Uganda was to improve sustainability and
            efficiency of piped networks in small towns by hiring
            private operators (POs) for their commercial management.
            Driven by a profit motive, POs were expected to maximize
            revenue, minimize waste and maintain and expand networks in
            a sustainable manner. To guard social objectives,
            infrastructure remained under government ownership and the
            introduction of POs was accompanied by a complex regulation,
            as well as support, framework.
