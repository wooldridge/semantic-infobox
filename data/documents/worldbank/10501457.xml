An Introduction to Self Supply:&#13;

Incremental improvements and private&#13;
investment in rural water supply&#13;
&#13;
Self Supply encourages the incremental improvement of household and community supply through user&#13;
investment in water treatment, supply construction and up-grading, including small rainwater harvesting and&#13;
groundwater systems. It is a concept which complements conventional rural water supply funded by government,&#13;
enabling self-help improvement of supplies where no protected supply is available, or where consumers feel they&#13;
can support higher levels of service than are presently provided by the public sector.&#13;

                        In South East Asia irrigation reduced poverty across all study systems14 and water supply improvements provided&#13;
                        the opportunity to create income through micro­enterprises, as well as time released from water collection being&#13;
                        converted into income earned15.&#13;
&#13;
                        In Mali a survey in two regions showed that 85 percent of water supplies with domestic and productive use were&#13;
                        privately owned family wells9.&#13;
&#13;
                        Families with rope pumps generate an average of $225 more per annum of income (ie about 50 percent above&#13;
                        average), in Nicaragua16.&#13;
&#13;
  2 Universal           A 12 percent increase in Tanzanian school attendance was found when water is available within fifteen minutes&#13;
    Primary Education   instead of being more than an hour away17.&#13;
&#13;
                        In Mali 95 percent of family wells were within fifteen minutes of the home, but only a third of communal wells9.&#13;
&#13;
  3 Gender              Household-level decision making generally favours greater input from female members. Men are more prepared to&#13;
                        collect water from sources nearer the house, especially if access and/or site hygiene is improved18.&#13;
&#13;
                        Water provision close to the house offers women in particular the opportunity for productive use where their&#13;
                        mobility is socially constrained13, and greater women's empowerment through changing gender relations within the&#13;
                        household15.&#13;

  4 Child Mortality     Among children under five years in developing countries, diarrhoeal disease accounts for 21 percent of all deaths19.&#13;
&#13;
                        "Children with homes more than 500 m from their water supply had much higher rates of diarrhoea compared with&#13;
                        children from houses with their own supply"20.&#13;
                        Fewtrell's recent systematic review21 of high quality studies of household water treatment at the point of use and&#13;
                        improved storage demonstrated a 34 percent reduction in diarrhoea.&#13;
&#13;

  7 Environmental       Sustainable development&#13;
    sustainability      Self Supply offers sustainable technologies and management systems, spreads abstraction of groundwater among&#13;
                        diffuse points and reduces concentration of livestock around water points. It may lead to increased abstraction but this&#13;
                        tends to be naturally limited by its effect on the water table.&#13;
&#13;
                        Sustainable access to safe drinking water&#13;
                        Access can be generally at household level, or near neighbour, where water is available within 15m of surface or as&#13;
                        rainwater harvesting. Safety is ensured by household water treatment, which is now being widely promoted.&#13;

            An introduction to self supply : putting

            The overall goal of Rural Water Supply
            Network (RWSN) is to lower costs, and improve sustainability
            of rural water supplies in Sub-Saharan Africa to help
            achieve the Millennium development goals (MDGs). This goal
            is further divided into four inter-linking themes, known as
            flagships with the following aims within Sub-Saharan Africa:
            1) self supply - private investment and household initiative
            are incorporated into national and international strategies
            for rural water supply improvement; 2) cost-effective
            boreholes (CEB) - policies are adopted and practices are
            followed which bring about cost-effective borehole
            provision; 3) sustainable water supplies (SWS) - rural
            households obtain highly valued community water supply
            services which they are capable of sustaining indefinitely;
            and 4) handpump technologies (HT) - good quality production
            of handpumps, is ensured along with appropriate selection,
            procurement and simplified maintenance.
