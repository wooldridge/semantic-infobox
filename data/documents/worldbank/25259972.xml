WSPâ&#128;&#153;s Scaling Up Rural Sanitation is working with governments and the local private sector to develop the knowledge needed&#13;
to scale up rural sanitation for the poor. The programmatic approach combines Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), be-&#13;
havior change communication, and sanitation marketing to generate sanitation demand and build up the supply of sanitation&#13;
products and services at scale. In addition, WSP works with local and national governments and the local private sector to&#13;
strengthen the enabling environmentâ&#128;&#148;including institutional, regulatory, financial, service-delivery, and monitoring capacitiesâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
to achieve change that is sustainable. Starting in India, Indonesia, and Tanzania in 2006, Scaling Up Rural Sanitation is currently&#13;
being implemented in more than a dozen countries. For more information, please visit www.wsp.org/scalingupsanitation.&#13;
&#13;
This Working Paper is one in a series of knowledge products designed to showcase project findings, assessments, and les-&#13;
sons learned in the Global Scaling Up Sanitation Project. This paper is conceived as a work in progress to encourage the&#13;
exchange of ideas about development issues. For more information please email worldbankwater@worldbank.org or visit&#13;

&#13;
Water and Sanitation Service Delivery Assessments (SDAs)                         block is assessed against specific indicators and is scored&#13;
are taking place in seven countries in the East Asia and the                     from 0 to 3 accordingly. The scorecard uses a simple color&#13;
Pacific region under the guidance of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Wa-                        code to indicate building blocks that are largely in place, act-&#13;
ter and Sanitation Program (WSP) and local partners. This                        ing as a driver for service delivery (score &gt;2, green); building&#13;
regional work, implemented through a country-led process,                        blocks that are a drag on service delivery and that require at-&#13;
draws on experience of water and sanitation SDAs conduct-                        tention (score 1â&#128;&#147;2, yellow); and building blocks that are inad-&#13;
ed in more than 40 countries in Africa, Latin America and                        equate, constituting a barrier to service delivery and a priority&#13;
South Asia.5                                                                     for reform (score &lt;1, red).&#13;
&#13;
The SDA analysis has three main components: a review                             The SDA analysis relies on an intensive, facilitated consulta-&#13;
of past water and sanitation coverage, a costing model to                        tion process, with government ownership and self-assess-&#13;
assess the adequacy of future investments, and a score-                          ment at its core. Through the SDA process, an evidence-&#13;
card that allows diagnosis of bottlenecks along the service                      based analysis has been conducted to better understand&#13;
delivery pathway. SDAâ&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only                       what undermines progress in water supply and sanitation&#13;
whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet                    and what the Government of Lao PDR can do to accelerate&#13;
sector targets for infrastructure and hardware but also what                     progress. A series of meetings and urban and rural sub-&#13;
specific issues need to be addressed to ensure that finance                      sector workshops with government and external support&#13;

This level of progress is encouraging, but it should be borne                       the north, and the open defecation rate remains high: while&#13;

b Public Expenditures include domestic (government sources) and external sources (development partners, NGOs and private sector); see table 3 below&#13;

    a External Investment: While there is NGO investment in water supply, it was not possible to determine the investment amount comprehensively, since many small NGOs operate â&#128;&#152;off&#13;
    budgetâ&#128;&#153;. Most NGO expenditure in sanitation, especially in rural sanitation, is on non-capital spending (â&#128;&#152;softwareâ&#128;&#153;), and an estimated amount has been included for capital spending. There&#13;
    appear to be several projects whose financing source is private, however these amounts were difficult to determine and hence might be underestimated.&#13;

&#13;
 A longstanding concern among sector stakeholders has                       More recently, a Water Supply Law came into force in 2010&#13;
 been the low priority afforded to WASH on the national                     to underpin the policy framework for the sector. Amongst&#13;
 development agendaâ&#128;&#148;particularly rural water supply and                     other things the law confirmed that responsibility for piped&#13;
 sanitation. The subject has limited visibility at policy level             public water supply schemes lies with the provincial utili-&#13;
 and institutions struggle to compete for resources within the              ties, with Nam Saat responsible for non-networked (in other&#13;
 ministries of Health and Public Works and Transport, which                 words, rural) schemes.&#13;
 have primary responsibility for water supply and sanitation.&#13;
 As a result, activity in the sector has long been heavily do-              Current policy encourages private sector participation in&#13;
 nor-dependent. There have, however, been some important                    service provision and indicates that utilities should adopt a&#13;
 developments in the policy and institutional framework for                 commercial orientation. In practice this has not happened,&#13;
 WASH over the last two decades and the sector is steadily                  though the utilities now have a significant degree of finan-&#13;
 gaining more strength and prominence.                                      cial autonomy and depend on revenue from customers to&#13;

 Urban Water Supply and Sanitation                                          vestments).18 There has also been some progress with pri-&#13;

 In 1999 a Water Policy Statement was issued under which re-                of small piped schemes, but only limited involvement so far&#13;

 In 2008, an Urban Water Supply Sector Road Map was ad-&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Lao PDR :
            turning finance into services for the future
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Water and sanitation service delivery
            assessments (SDAs) are taking place in seven countries in
            the East Asia and the Pacific region under the guidance of
            the World Bank’s water and sanitation program (WSP) and
            local partners. The SDA analysis has three main components:
            a review of past water and sanitation coverage, a costing
            model to assess the adequacy of future investments, and a
            scorecard that allows diagnosis of bottlenecks along the
            service delivery pathway. The SDA analysis relies on an
            intensive, facilitated consultation process, with government
            ownership, and self-assessment at its core. The analysis
            aims to help the Government of Lao People’s Democratic
            Republic (PDR) assess how it can strengthen pathways for
            turning finance into water supply and sanitation services in
            each of four subsectors. This report evaluates the service
            delivery pathway in its entirety, locating the bottlenecks,
            and presenting the agreed priority actions to help address them.
