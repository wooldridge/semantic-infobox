equity capital. The weights are the portion of&#13;

A point of interest in the Enargas review is the&#13;
adaptation of methods developed in the United&#13;
States or Europe to overcome the lack of data in&#13;
Argentina. In particular, the methodology adopted&#13;
for estimating the cost of capital may be relevant&#13;
to other developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
Gas transport and distribution licenses require&#13;
Enargas to identify projects that will lead to effi-&#13;
ciency gains in order to set the X factors. This&#13;
approach is unlikely to detect the full range of&#13;
efficiency improvements that could potentially&#13;
be made, and furthermore may lead to excessive&#13;
micromanagement of firms by the regulator. To&#13;
overcome these problems, Enargas used a more&#13;
aggregate method (total factor productivity&#13;
analysis) to determine companies' potential effi-&#13;
ciency gains. The use of this methodology was&#13;
contested by the industry, however.&#13;

            The 1996-97 gas price review in Argentina
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Argentina's natural gas industry
            was privatized at the end of 1992. Prior to divestiture, the
            state-owned monopoly Gas del Estado was divided into two
            transport and eight distribution companies, all of which
            were sold through international bidding. An independent
            government body, Ente Naal Regulador de Gas (Enargas), was
            established to regulate the transport and distribution
            segments of the industry. As part of its mandate, Enargas is
            in charge of price reviews. These reviews, which occur every
            five years, determine the allowed tariffs for each transport
            and distribution company. The first such review took place
            in 1996-97, and the new tariffs went into effect in January
            1998. This Note examines the methodology and outcome of this
            experience. The Enargas price review is of interest for
            several reasons. First, it is the first of its kind in
            Argentina, and one of the first in a developing country. The
            outcome of the process provides a test of the regulatory
            framework adopted by the Argentine government, and may
            influence regulatory reform in other parts of the world.
            Second, as the first such event, the 1996-97 review set a
            precedent for methodologies and approaches to be used in
            future utility price reviews in Argentina. Finally, the
            approach used to calculate the cost of capital-as well as
            the other parameters used to set prices-provide an
            interesting illustration of how theoretical and practical
            methods from regulatory practice in industrial countries can
            be adapted to developing countries, where data availability
            and other restrictions prevent a direct transfer of techniques.
