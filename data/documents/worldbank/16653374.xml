                       End-Year Report (July 1, 2005 â&#128;&#147; June 30, 2006)&#13;
&#13;
1. Introduction&#13;
&#13;
This End of Year Review (EYR) report summarizes the results achieved during FY2006 (July 1&#13;
2005 â&#128;&#147; June 30 2006). The report provides an assessment of the extent to which the targets of the&#13;
FY06 Business Plan were achieved and draws lessons for strengthening implementation for the&#13;
current year. The EYR provides the critical link between the FY06 and FY07 business plans and&#13;
ensures coordination, linkage and continuation between the two fiscal years. The report provides&#13;
an overview of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s achievements along the main thematic areas of the business plan, a&#13;
summary status of project delivery, budget expenditures, new funding and human resources.&#13;
Finally, the report provides a description of the main results in WSP focus countries (Annex 1).&#13;
&#13;
At the end of the Fiscal Year in June 2006, the WSP work program included 114 multi-year&#13;
projects with an average expenditure of approximately US$189,000 per project. The total&#13;
expenditure at the end of the FY was $21.6 million against an initial budget of $23.4 million. The&#13;
review shows that the portfolio expanded by about 16% (from 98 projects at the end of FY05)&#13;
while the expenditures increased by about 23% between the two fiscal years. This expanding&#13;
trend is expected to continue into FY07 and beyond, arising mainly from the urgent need for&#13;
strengthened support to countries to make progress towards the MDGs combined with additional&#13;
support from donors. To adequately respond to this expanding portfolio, WSP hired in FY06&#13;
high-caliber staff and embarked on significant efforts to design and implement more effective&#13;
systems to plan, implement, monitor, and report on outcomes and results.&#13;
&#13;
2. Status of Implementation at the end of FY2006&#13;
&#13;
This section highlights the main activities and results achieved from implementation of the&#13;
business plan during the year, along the key themes under which the various projects fall, but&#13;
based on specific actions and progress at country level. This thematic format for progress&#13;
reporting is a departure from the past when reporting was based on specific and individual&#13;
projects. Thematic reporting has the advantage of capturing the programâ&#128;&#153;s activities and results&#13;
in a more comprehensive manner as well as strengthening cross-regional learning and sharing&#13;
among staff and ultimately with clients. This format was used for progress reporting to the 2006&#13;
WSP council meeting and was a superior format than the project-based one. The Council also&#13;
endorsed this reporting format.&#13;
&#13;
2.1     Roadmaps for Sector Development: The objective is to support country dialogue, develop&#13;
policies and financing strategies to stimulate sector investments to achieve national targets and&#13;
the MDGs. MDG roadmaps were completed for all focus countries in Africa and for Honduras&#13;
and Nicaragua in Latin America as well as scale-up action plans for Indonesia and states in India.&#13;
WSP also completed Country Status Overviews (CSOs) for 20 African countries, as a flagship&#13;
product. The Country Status Overviews report on WSS MDG achievement by seeking to bring&#13;
&amp;#12;together current data that sector leaders and support agencies can use to assess progress and have&#13;
a comparative basis for sharing country experiences and identifying corrective action. WSP also&#13;
worked with the government in Indonesia to develop Sector Action Plans and financing&#13;
strategies including city-wide strategies for scaling up sustainable sanitation. WSP provided&#13;
programmatic support to RWSS in India by completing sector assessments and sector&#13;
transformation plans that leveraged more than $1billion from the Government of India, States&#13;
and donors. The focus for FY07 will be to prepare annual reports on progress on WSS MDG&#13;
roadmaps in Africa, strengthen M&amp;E and capacity building in all the regions, continue reform&#13;
advocacy with central and local government agencies, and carry out more MDG advocacy work&#13;
and visioning exercises especially in Latin America.&#13;
&#13;
2.2     Large Scale RWSS (Rural Water and Sanitation System) Investments: WSP supported&#13;
country-led reforms and development of strategies for planning of large scale RWSS investments&#13;
to leverage resources, improve sector coordination and help to bring donors together to focus&#13;
their support on government-led programs. WSP has had significant engagement in the&#13;
development of RWSS investment program and implementation in Senegal and Benin which is&#13;
contributing to the expansion of the populationâ&#128;&#153;s access to services in the two countries. In&#13;
Senegal, access to water supply and sanitation increased from 64% and 17% in 2004 to 67% and&#13;
20% in 2006, respectively and is expected to further increase to 77% and 44% by 2012. In Benin,&#13;
access to improved rural water supply increased from 35% (2002) to 46% (2006) and is expected&#13;
to reach 55% by 2009. Program activities also included support to development of RWSS reform&#13;
programs in India, leading to increased investments from the Government of India and donors. In&#13;
Indonesia, WSP supported policy reform implementation which has been able to leverage&#13;
investments from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the government. This has&#13;
led to scaling up of RWSS implementation in 80 districts out of 400. Preparation of a SWAP,&#13;
and a sector financing strategy has been completed under the Bank-funded PAMSIMAS&#13;
(Community Based Drinking Water and Sanitation Services) which will also finance scaling up&#13;
of community based water supply and environmental policy implementation in 15 out of 23&#13;
provinces. In Latin America, WSP supported the transition from pilot to RWSS program in Peru&#13;
through the IDA-funded PRONASAR which increased coverage of the rural population by more&#13;
than 30%. RWSS has been WSPâ&#128;&#153;s most mature area of work and has been able to show results&#13;
over the years. The focus going forward will be to: (a) continue strengthening local governments&#13;
to plan and monitor RWSS activities and to develop incentives for reforming local governments,&#13;
(b) develop tools for M&amp;E of impacts; (c) strengthen sustainability of services by identifying&#13;
alternative management arrangements/models; (d) examine options for responding to the needs&#13;
of dispersed communities; (e) identify new and innovative areas/topics, and (f) strengthen&#13;
documentation and sharing of lessons.&#13;
&#13;
2.3         Domestic/Local Private Sector: This initiative seeks to leverage more financial and&#13;
technical inputs from the domestic private sector to expand services especially to the poor in&#13;
rural areas, small towns, and peri-urban/slums in urban areas. WSP work has focused on two&#13;
primary areas of action needed to unlock the market, developing the capacity of the supply and&#13;
demand sides of the market, and promoting an enabling environment for domestic private&#13;
operators, During the FY, WSP engaged in a wide range of innovative activities to:&#13;
&#13;
    a)   create an enabling environment for small providers (Philippines, Lao PDR, Cambodia);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
&amp;#12;    b)  pilot private operation of small towns (Vietnam, Peru, India and Bangladesh);&#13;
    c)  improve efficiency of borehole drilling through the Drilling Entrepreneur Support&#13;
        Initiative (Africa);&#13;
    c) introduce innovative management models through partnerships between utilities &amp;&#13;
        informal/small providers (Kenya, Tanzania);&#13;
    d) design OBA schemes (Kenya), design-operate and lease contracts (Bangladesh);&#13;
    e) transition from government ownership and operation to private sector and joint stock&#13;
        companies (Red River Delta, Vietnam);&#13;
    (f) develop large scale PPPs with pro-poor focus (Delhi, Bangalore, Goa and Dar-es-&#13;
        Salaam) and in towns (Burkina); and&#13;
    (g) strengthen action planning to improve services to the poor (Seven Cities in LATIN&#13;
        AMERICA).&#13;
&#13;
WSP will continue to document and disseminate successful experiences from implementing&#13;
these and other activities and to support scaling up of domestic private sector engagement as a&#13;
means of expanding access to reach the MDGs. Other areas needing focus are to: (a) develop&#13;
innovative models for reaching the poor in large cities and design pro-poor components in large&#13;
scale investments; (b) support development of large scale domestic private sector operators to&#13;
enable them partner and compete for contracts in large cities; (c) strengthen awareness on the&#13;
need for reform and the risks of not serving the poor; and (d) continue to advocate for a bigger&#13;
role for the local private sector and prepare clients to counter misinformation.&#13;
&#13;
2.4. Sanitation and Hygiene: Under this theme, program activities have focused on behavior&#13;
change and informed choice, promotion of small-scale providers, development of enabling&#13;
environment to increase access to finance and involvement of local stakeholders, and&#13;
development of strategies to raise the profile of sanitation and attract investments. WSP&#13;
supported implementation of Community-Led Total Sanitation in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan,&#13;
India and Indonesia) where national policies and fiscal rewards are incentivizing rapid scale up,&#13;
resulting in significant impacts. Coverage in Bangladesh has increased from 33% (2003) to 70%&#13;
(2006). A study to evaluate health impacts of behavior change in India is underway where initial&#13;
findings show that collective behavior change has an influence on changing perceptions and&#13;
sanitation behavior at the household level. In Latin America and Africa, program activities have&#13;
focused on development of sanitation marketing by promoting local businesses and behavior&#13;
change. WSP will continue to have significant engagement in organizing and supporting regional&#13;
conferences (AfricaSan +5, SacoSan II, EASan, LatinSan) to highlight the importance of&#13;
sanitation. One area that WSP needs to look more into is identifying approaches to scale up&#13;
sanitation in low income urban areas/slums. The Public-Private Partnership for Hand Washing&#13;
has had a successful year with a near tripling of the number of country-level programs and&#13;
strengthening of existing ones. The Secretariatâ&#128;&#153;s activities have contributed to increasing the&#13;
profile of HW amongst both the global public health and water communities. The Secretariat&#13;
created the first ever PPPHW at the Global Health Council and American Public Health&#13;
Association and is playing a key role in advancing development of indicators for HW. The threat&#13;
of a global Avian Flu pandemic provided the Secretariat with an opportunity to showcase the&#13;
advantages of hand washing as a rapidly implementable, low cost form of prevention. The&#13;
Secretariat was able to provide the World Bank and WHO Avian Flu teams with timely and&#13;
relevant information on HW as a first line defense against pandemic flu. The Secretariatâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3&#13;
&amp;#12;advocacy activities have also continued to leverage new funding and partnerships (USA, Irish&#13;
Aid, Danida Vietnam).&#13;
&#13;
2.5 Country M&amp;E systems: Activities under this theme seek to increase accountability and&#13;
improve provision of WSS services by helping clients to develop systems for sector&#13;
implementation and results monitoring. Demand for support to develop M&amp;E system has been&#13;
growing steadily as pressure to meet the MDGs increases. During FY06, WSP worked with&#13;
clients to develop Sector Information Management Systems (SIMS) and organize regional&#13;
dissemination of best practice in Peru as well as other countries in the Latin America region and&#13;
in Africa in support of the Country Status Overviews and MDG roadmaps. WSP is also in the&#13;
process of elaborating a concept note on M&amp;E upon request from the African Development&#13;
Bank, the EU and the World Bank. In India, WSP designed M&amp;E systems for RWSS which are&#13;
now being piloted in four states. As part of its support to the JMP, WSP, together with UNICEF,&#13;
carried out RWSS sector assessments in 22 Indian states that uncovered inconsistencies between&#13;
HH survey data and government data, leading to broader reflection and elaboration of a set of&#13;
benchmarks for the RWSS sector. Activities also included benchmarking 13 utilities to each&#13;
other and to best practice in South Asia and benchmarking of small providers (Philippines and&#13;
Vietnam). These positive experiences are leading to institutionalization of benchmarking in the&#13;
region. The IBNET database was launched during the FY and provides access to a large dataset&#13;
of water utility performance data. The database currently has data available for about 1,800&#13;
utilities in more than 70 countries. Use of the IBNET database has increased dramatically, with&#13;
hits now standing at about 75,000 per month and cross referencing in more than 60 websites.&#13;
&#13;
2.6     Finance and anti-corruption: The goal of activities under this theme is to improve the&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of resources, strengthen integration of WSS into national budgets&#13;
and poverty reduction strategies, develop innovations to leverage local domestic resources, and&#13;
reduce financial leakages. Support included: (a) mobilization of private sector/market-based&#13;
resources (Bangladesh, Philippines, Kenya); (b) design of municipality-operator contracts&#13;
(Peru), pro-poor tariff and subsidies, guidelines for financial planning and efficiency&#13;
improvement (Delhi and Bangalore); (c) design of fiscal mechanisms to provide incentives for&#13;
sector institutions and service providers (India); (d) development of sector information and&#13;
monitoring systems (Africa and Latin America); (e) development of fiscal incentives to stimulate&#13;
outcomes in rural sanitation and services to the urban poor (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh), and (f)&#13;
development of tools to improve sectoral allocations and strengthening the budget process&#13;
(Kenya). On anti-corruption, WSP prepared a framework paper diagnosing corruption in the&#13;
sector and was among the founding partners of the Water Integrity Network. WSP also&#13;
participated in the first high level meeting on anti-corruption in the sector together with the&#13;
World Bank and Sida in Uganda, implemented activities to strengthen consumer/citizen voice as&#13;
a tool in fighting corruption (India, Kenya), and developed the widely disseminated Cartoon&#13;
Calendar with corruption as the theme. Going forward, WSP will also work to ensure stronger&#13;
integration of the anti-corruption work into the broader context of support to reforms, policies&#13;
and strategies and to strengthen collaboration with the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s activities in this area.&#13;
&#13;
2.7   Global Practice Teams: WSP established Global Practice Teams (GPTs) in FY05 to&#13;
enhance global knowledge management and learning and to strengthen influence on the Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4&#13;
&amp;#12;and other IFIs. During FY06, GPTs built cross-regional teams and continued implementation of&#13;
their work programs in:&#13;
&#13;
    a)     Communications: cross-regional learning on how to support strategic&#13;
           communications in client countries&#13;
    b)     Finance: improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public financial management&#13;
           practices and leveraging additional resources for WSS financing&#13;
    c)     RWSS: Multiple use of domestic water, to establish the links with poverty reduction&#13;
           and improved sustainability&#13;
    d)     Sanitation and Hygiene: sustainability of changed behaviors under different sanitation&#13;
           and hygiene approaches and programs&#13;
    e)     Urban WSS and the poor: reforms to support service expansion for the poor, develop&#13;
           modalities for linking local private operators to utilities and municipalities and&#13;
           strengthen the role and voice of the poor&#13;
&#13;
During FY06, GPTs strengthened links with other organizations and started to share and&#13;
disseminate their work by participating in national/regional/international fora (the finance GPT&#13;
participated in the regional Conference on Water Financing held in Philippines; the finance,&#13;
sanitation and hygiene and the urban WSS GPTs prepared WSPâ&#128;&#153;s presentations in Mexico). The&#13;
WSP Council gave strong endorsement to the GPTs as a means of strengthening global learning&#13;
and recommended enhancement of their analytical capacities.&#13;
&#13;
2.8.    Development Marketplace 2006: WSP and ESMAP were the technical partners for the&#13;
2006 Development Marketplace (DM). The DM focused on basic needs for clean water, hygiene,&#13;
sanitation and access to energy. A total of 2,525 proposals were received, the bulk of which&#13;
related to water (45%) and sanitation (27%). Thirty innovative projects (14 from Africa) were&#13;
awarded $5million. Examples of the winning projects included: (a) pro-poor demand creation in&#13;
Bolivia; (b) providing rope pumps in Cambodia; (c) local Water Pyramid in the Gambia; and (d)&#13;
Roof water harvesting in HIV/TB Households in Uganda. The winning projects are expected to&#13;
provide concrete benefits to their communities and beyond through implementation of the&#13;
approved activities and replication of lessons learnt. WSP and ESMAP will provide supervision&#13;
support in the implementation phase to ensure that the projects are implemented as planned and&#13;
that lessons are well documented and disseminated.&#13;
&#13;
2.9 Efficiency and Streamlining of WSP &amp; ESMAP: The World Bank carried out a business&#13;
efficiency review in 2005 which identified opportunities to merge common support functions by&#13;
pooling teams and streamlining procedures among global programs. Arising from the&#13;
recommendations of the review, the efficiency and streamlining process between WSP &amp;&#13;
ESMAP was launched in Nov 2005. This process led to the streamlining of: (a) the management&#13;
of WSP and ESMAP under one Program Manager; (b) financial management under one&#13;
Resource Management Officer; (c) communications and knowledge management under a joint&#13;
Communications Officer; (d) HR activities into one team under a joint HR Officer. Work&#13;
program activities for domestic private sector and SMEs will also be streamlined under one&#13;
Financial/SME Specialist whose recruitment is to be finalized during the first semester of FY07.&#13;
Both programs are also working to strengthen and possibly integrate their M&amp;E systems with a&#13;
focus on strengthening monitoring and reporting of outcomes and results. Highlights of progress&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5&#13;
&amp;#12;on the streamlining were presented to the Council meeting in June 2006 and a progress report&#13;
covering the period up to July 31, 2006 has recently been circulated to the donor councils of both&#13;
programs. Further streamlining of functions may be reviewed arising from the integration of the&#13;
Infrastructure and the Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development that was&#13;
announced by the President of the World Bank in June 2006. This integration presents special&#13;
opportunities for ESMAP and WSP to leverage its activities across sectors that are naturally&#13;
related to its activities, such as environment and social development. During the second semester&#13;
of 2006, the programs will be exploring ways to leverage these opportunities and push&#13;
innovations in order to provide better support to client countries.&#13;
&#13;
2.10 Developing a new Strategy for WSP: WSP is in the process of developing a new strategy to&#13;
cover the period 2006 â&#128;&#147; 2015. The new strategy articulates institutional and behavior change as&#13;
the key to moving to more effective and efficient services provision. The strategy will focus on&#13;
achievement of the MDGs, scaling up of sustainable WSS services provision, and on poverty&#13;
reduction, working along the following broad themes:&#13;
&#13;
    (a) Governance: regulations, institutions, accountability, participation, decentralization,&#13;
        gender, and anti-corruption;&#13;
    (b) behavior change: sanitation demand generation, hygiene hand washing, conservation,&#13;
        gender;&#13;
    (c) finance: fiscal transfers, leveraging additional resources, economics;&#13;
    (d) improved service providers and options: sustainability, environment, domestic PSP,&#13;
        technologies, approaches to pro-poor services;&#13;
    (e) programmatic approaches: scaling up programs, harmonization, M&amp;E, MDG roadmaps,&#13;
        sector development plans, SWAPs, PRSPs; and&#13;
    (f) cross sectoral linkages: urban governance, rural development, health, education, water&#13;
        resources management, gender, climate change, energy.&#13;
&#13;
WSP presented an overview of the strategy at the June 2006 council meeting. As a step towards&#13;
further development of the strategy, WSP has recently circulated an updated draft of the strategic&#13;
operational principles for discussion with the donors who will be attending the 2006 Stockholm&#13;
Water Week. WSP plans to finalize the strategy in the first semester of FY07.&#13;
&#13;
2.11 Improving outcome and results monitoring of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s work program: Building on the&#13;
improvements started in FY05, WSP has taken significant measures that will lead to the design&#13;
and implementation of an integrated M&amp;E system to strengthen the capture and aggregation of&#13;
outcomes at country, regional and global level, using an innovative methodology â&#128;&#147; storylines and&#13;
ratings. The new system would in particular, focus on outcomes and results, linking them to&#13;
WSPâ&#128;&#153;s mission and strategy, through the balanced scorecard, and strengthen the capacity of staff&#13;
to undertake M&amp;E and deepen the results culture using storylines. WSP commissioned a firm,&#13;
ITAD of UK, to: (a) identify strengths and gaps in the existing M&amp;E system, (b) develop&#13;
storylines as an alternative and complementary methodology to the log frame; (c) develop and&#13;
deliver a training package to staff to build their skills and provide them with the tools needed to&#13;
use the enhanced system; and (d) provide suggestions on how to use the information generated&#13;
from the M&amp;E system to improve delivery of services. The enhanced M&amp;E system will be&#13;
grounded in storylines at activity, project, country, regional and global levels to clearly elaborate:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6&#13;
&amp;#12;(a) the problems that WSP is seeking to address, (b) strategies to address the identified problems,&#13;
and (c) evidence of success and what is happening on the ground including performance&#13;
indicators. The enhanced M&amp;E is expected to: (a) allow WSP staff to measure progress against&#13;
its mission and mandate at every level of the M&amp;E system; (b) enable capture of the effects of&#13;
integrated initiatives and programs that combine WSPâ&#128;&#153;s different products to create solutions for&#13;
our clientsâ&#128;&#153; problems; and (c) be credible, transparent and include independent elements (e.g.,&#13;
ex-post evaluations by independent organizations). ITAD made a presentation on the proposed&#13;
approach to the 2006 Council meeting. The Council supported this initiative and agreed to name&#13;
key experts from their organizations who are engaged in M&amp;E to work with WSP and&#13;
accompany the process of completing development of the system. WSP will submit to the&#13;
Council for information, the updated proposal with a view to piloting the system in one region&#13;
and rolling it out it the others starting with the FY08 business plan.&#13;
&#13;
3   Delivery Status&#13;
&#13;
WSP continues to monitor and report on progress based on semi-annual project level monitoring&#13;
based on outcome/impact. WSP also maintained a flexible approach during the year to take&#13;
advantage of changing circumstances and to respond to new opportunities and demands from our&#13;
clients and partners. Monitoring and reporting based on outcomes will be further strengthened as&#13;
we move to implement an integrated M&amp;E system that will help to capture and aggregate&#13;
outcomes at country, regional and global level, using an innovative methodology â&#128;&#147; storylines and&#13;
ratings.&#13;
&#13;
The EYR identified projects: (i) that were delayed and required corrective measures, (ii) whose&#13;
scope of work required modification, and (iii) that can be expanded based on budget planning for&#13;
FY07. The review shows that overall, 54% of the 114 projects were progressing well on target&#13;
while 9% had been completed. For purposes of the EYR, projects are defined as delayed if the&#13;
delivery of their intermediate outputs is delayed by more than two months and this delay may&#13;
ultimately jeopardize on-time delivery. The EYR has given an opportunity for WSP management&#13;
to review the reasons for delays. The main causes included:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   delays in procurement of consultants and recruitment of key staff&#13;
â&#128;¢   unexpected departures of task managers and other key project staff&#13;
â&#128;¢   delayed response and action by partner governments, and&#13;
â&#128;¢   pace of other partners involved in implementation of projects.&#13;
&#13;
WSP has been taking measures during the year that are expected to result in improved&#13;
performance. These measures include: (a) recruitment of key staff in all regions is largely&#13;
completed, (b) strengthened procurement through establishment of a procurement task force&#13;
charged with the identification of an improvement plan as well as regional exchanges to enable&#13;
mentoring of staff and sharing of successful experiences across regions, (c) strengthened&#13;
administration by hiring a global administration coordinator and RM officer, (d) building in more&#13;
realism into the FY07 business plan and strengthening our planning, especially quality at entry.&#13;

&amp;#12;4.      FY06 Operating Budget and Expenditure&#13;
&#13;
As the Table 1 shows, WSP began the year with a budget of US$ 24.3 million, and subsequently&#13;
revised it upward at mid-year to US$27.5 million. Final disbursements totaled US$21.6 million,&#13;
very much in line with the projection of $21.8 million presented to the Council. In addition to&#13;
disbursements, there were some US$ 3 million in commitments at the end of the fiscal year&#13;
which will be disbursed in early FY07.&#13;

Disbursements continued their upward trend (Table 2 below), with the overall level increasing by&#13;
23% over FY05. East Asia showed the strongest growth with a 68% increase, followed by 56%&#13;
in Latin America and 38% in Africa. Spending in global programs showed modest growth, as&#13;
the new Global Practice Teams were still in initial stages. In South Asia, disbursements declined&#13;
somewhat for the reasons cited elsewhere, but were still 35% higher than FY04 and are expected&#13;
to continue to grow in FY07.&#13;

&#13;
As of 1 July 2006, the level of total funds available and formally pledged to the Program stands&#13;
at $ 57 million. This is based on actual funds received and undisbursed as of this date, plus&#13;
additional funding committed through signed legal agreements.&#13;
&#13;
Between 1 January and 30 June 2006, the following new funding was secured through signed&#13;
legal agreements:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Australia (AusAid): A$ 400,000 added to existing agreement for South Asia regional&#13;
         core funding.&#13;
     â&#128;¢   United Kingdom (DFID): US$ 75,000 added to an existing agreement to fund Sector-&#13;
         Wide Investment Financing Tool (SWIFT) finance activities in Mozambique.&#13;
     â&#128;¢   United States (USAid): US$ 450,000 over 3 years to support the Secretariat of the&#13;
         Public-Private Partnership in Hand washing&#13;
&#13;
Fully unearmarked global core funding remains low as a percentage of overall Program funding.&#13;
Its share slipped further as existing funds were disbursed and new funding agreements during the&#13;
period were all earmarked in some manner.&#13;
1&#13;
  Core funding for this report has been redefined to include only fully unearmarked global core funding. Data for&#13;
the earlier reporting periods has been adjusted accordingly. Earlier reports included funding earmarked to regions&#13;
and to global themes under core funding, but these funds are still restricted in scope, even though they offer more&#13;
flexibility than narrowly-defined project funding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9&#13;
&amp;#12;As reported to the Council, progress in establishing a multi-donor trust fund has been slower than&#13;
anticipated due to accounting issues on regional window earmarking. These should be overcome&#13;
and a multi-donor trust fund established in the first quarter of FY07.&#13;
&#13;
6.       Human Resources&#13;
&#13;
At the close of the FY, WSP had about 85 staff and 45 consultants showing an increase of about&#13;
20% since the end of FY05. FY06 has seen significant strategic and coordinated global and&#13;
regional recruitment in response to: (a) an expanded work program for WSP, (b) streamlining of&#13;
WSP and ESMAP support functions, (c) strengthening of field presence through recruitment of&#13;
country coordinators in all regions, and (d) strengthening thematic leadership in the key areas of&#13;
local urban WSS, sanitation, finance and communications. The recruitment of a SME Specialist&#13;
is on-going. Some limited recruitment is likely to continue into FY07 in response to the&#13;
Councilâ&#128;&#153;s request to strengthen the analytical capacities of GPTs and to replace key thematic&#13;
leaders that are expected to depart during the first semester of FY07.&#13;
&#13;
The list below shows key hires during the last FY. It shows, among others, a strengthening of&#13;
WSPâ&#128;&#153;s in-country presence through recruitment of 9 country coordinators during the FY, and the&#13;
WSP global team.&#13;

            Water and Sanitation Program : fiscal year
            2006 end year report (July 1, 2005 - June 30, 2006)
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This End of Year Review (EYR) report
            summarizes the results achieved during FY2006 (July 1 2005 -
            June 30 2006). The report provides an assessment of the
            extent to which the targets of the FY06 business plan were
            achieved and draws lessons for strengthening implementation
            for the current year. The EYR provides the critical link
            between the FY06 and FY07 business plans and ensures
            coordination, linkage and continuation between the two
            fiscal years. The report provides an overview of Water and
            Sanitation Program (WSP) achievements along the main
            thematic areas of the business plan, a summary status of
            project delivery, budget expenditures, new funding and human
            resources. Finally, the report provides a description of the
            main results in WSP focus countries (annex one). At the end
            of the fiscal year in June 2006, the WSP work program
            included 114 multi-year projects with an average expenditure
            of approximately US$189,000 per project. The total
            expenditure at the end of the FY was $21.6 million against
            an initial budget of $23.4 million. The review shows that
            the portfolio expanded by about 16 percent (from 98 projects
            at the end of FY05) while the expenditures increased by
            about 23 percent between the two fiscal years. This
            expanding trend is expected to continue into FY07 and
            beyond, arising mainly from the urgent need for strengthened
            support to countries to make progress towards the Millennium
            Development Goals, or MDGs combined with additional support
            from donors. To adequately respond to this expanding
            portfolio, WSP hired in FY06 high-caliber staff and embarked
            on significant efforts to design and implement more
            effective systems to plan, implement, monitor, and report on
            outcomes and results.
