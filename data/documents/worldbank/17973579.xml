Interview by: William H. Becker &amp; Marie T. Zenni&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    1&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I'm Bill Becker with the Business History Group.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: And I'm Marie Zenni, task manager of the Oral History Program.&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: And I'm Jules Muis, just retired from the Bank as Vice President and Controller, seven&#13;
to eight days now.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, congratulations.&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: "Retired from the Bank," which doesn't mean "retired".&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: No! We understand that. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you and to conduct this&#13;
interview. Today is Thursday, the fourteenth of September, 2000. Mr. Muis, we'd like to begin&#13;
by asking just a few questions about your background. Where were you born?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: I was born in Purmerend, which at the time was a little cattle town north of Amsterdam,&#13;
and right in the middle of the war in 1943.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And where did you receive your early schooling, in that place?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: No. We moved immediately after the war to the south of Holland, from the north to the&#13;
south--big difference between the two. The north is Calvinistic with a life philosophy of, "If it&#13;
doesn't hurt, it can't be good!" And the south is Burgundian Catholic, basically saying, "There's&#13;
always Friday for confession." My father was a Calvinist, and my mother was a Catholic.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see! And where did you prefer to live?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: I felt at ease, probably a little better "dans rna peau" in the south.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Where did you receive your formal training?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: I had my formal training in the south, unless you mean my professional training.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, your professional training.&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Mainly in Amsterdam, not in the university classes as it took about ten to fifteen years in&#13;
the Netherlands to get qualified as a professional accountant. There were two ways, one of&#13;
which is the academic way. I did it the most expedient way. Instead of first getting my doctoral&#13;
in economics and then doing a three to five year post-doctoral study, I hardly went to class. I&#13;
simply went to the university library and for my exams. I did that for about six or seven years&#13;
while at the same time working for Ernst and Young--or Whinney Murray, Ernst and Ernst, as it&#13;
was called in those days. So that meant that I was qualified when I was 27 rather than the&#13;
average 35. And it also meant that I could make some money in the meantime, and so that's&#13;
                                        Jules W. Muis&#13;
                                September 14, 2000 - Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  2&#13;
&#13;
what I did.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see. Were there early experiences that influenced your later career? I mean, were&#13;
there members of your family that had been in the accounting profession?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: No. I've always been very interested in the business of transparency, and accounting is&#13;
really a much more unique way of looking at the world than people think. You have not only the&#13;
still picture, balance sheet, and "snapshot" of a company every year, every quarter, or at the end&#13;
of each month, but also the "moving picture;" the income statement; it is a very fascinating piece&#13;
of information. If you really look at the life cycle of an organization, accounting is a very, very&#13;
condensed form of real life experience of companies. I've always been fascinated by that, never&#13;
as in looking back as an historian of events, but as an analytical tool.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay, and so you began with the predecessor of what is today Ernst and Young?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: No. At first I started as an internal auditor with Phillips, and then I had my military&#13;
draft. I was still in Holland. And after military service I started with Time Life to subsequently&#13;
do exactly the opposite: join the auditor of Time Life which was Whinney Murray, Ernst and&#13;
Ernst. Mostly, accounting careers go the other way around, from an auditor to the client. I went&#13;
from a client to the auditor. I got six to seven years of experience in the Anglo-American&#13;
philosophy of accounting and auditing. And then I joined a European accounting group for&#13;
about six to seven years in the '70s where I got my European grooming. After that I rejoined&#13;
Ernst and Young for a fantastic job which was called "Director Quality Control" for Europe and&#13;
for Africa.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What year was that?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: That was in '79-80 until '82. I subsequently became managing partner of Ernst and&#13;
Whinney in the Netherlands, which was followed by various mergers. In the early '90s I became&#13;
executive partner of Ernst &amp; Young, Europe, for the merged practice of Ernst and Whinney and&#13;
Arthur Young, which had about 25,000 people in Europe. It was a fantastic period where one&#13;
had to bring two cultures together, which was just after the iron curtain had fallen, so under very,&#13;
very spectacular circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What in your career most prepared you for what you came to face at the Bank? In&#13;
other words, what would you consider to have been the most valuable previous experience?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: I've always worked in a strongly multicultural environment. I've always worked&#13;
professionally in a very diverse environment. I was 50 at the time and felt I'd done everything in&#13;
the public accounting profession that I could possibly do. I had been president of the Dutch&#13;
Institute of CPAs, and within my firm I'd had all the positions that I aspired to. I'd always&#13;
planned to have a different license to life, and I happened to see on television the big&#13;
demonstrations against the Bank in Madrid of "Fifty Years Is Enough!" This happened actually&#13;
                                            Jules W. M uis&#13;
                                September 14, 2000 - Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      3&#13;
&#13;
the year that I turned 50, and I said to my wife, "Maybe there's something to it!" And so I&#13;
resigned from the firm. I had a two-year notice time and worked with major clients, and so I had&#13;
two years to think about it.&#13;
&#13;
And in those two years the opportunity for the World Bank came up. I received a phone call&#13;
from a head hunter who I knew quite well, and he said, "The president of the World Bank invites&#13;
you to become vice president and controller of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Oh, that's an easy way of getting a job, but also very fascinating."&#13;
&#13;
And so I came to Washington for my interviews and found that the president of the World Bank&#13;
had invited ten more people to become vice president and controller of the World Bank. It&#13;
turned out to be a real recruitment process at age fifty, which is really quite an experience to go&#13;
through. It's the last thing that you actually prepare yourself for. And so there was a shootout&#13;
between the ten. I interviewed with about ten VPs [vice presidents]. Two of us were short-&#13;
listed, which I heard about ten days later, and so we were called in again to talk to the president&#13;
for his final call. At least I found out who the other short-listed person was--it was a Frenchman-&#13;
-because the recruitment department had by mistake sent his letter and itinerary to my hotel&#13;
room.&#13;
&#13;
I met with Lew [Lewis T.] Preston, and we hit it off very, very well. And so we talked for about&#13;
two and a half hours instead of the originally scheduled half hour. I think it was one of the most&#13;
frank and finest discussions I've ever had with anyone in the Bank. Well, he had been with the&#13;
Bank for two, three years, and I didn't know he was seriously ill. It was very clear to me that he&#13;
had come to a juncture of conclusions on how he wanted to run the Bank. Everything in the&#13;
Bank was done in a "power behind the throne" way. You had the Ernie [Ernest] Stem and&#13;
Moeen Qureshi competing tribes in those days; a very binary construct which, fortunately, I&#13;
never had to take sides on. I understand they were both very strong and very good people,&#13;
basically very, very skilled.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, Lew had concluded that there were "no controls at the Bank," as he put it; a frankness&#13;
that surprised me. He hadn't hired me yet, and so I had my first disagreement with my future&#13;
boss because I basically told him, "It can't be that there are no controls at the Bank. It is too big&#13;
for that. And yes, you may have had your control problems with the building complex and&#13;
overruns, etcetera, but there has to be a solid start-out base." He still hired me. And that's what&#13;
my opening shot was when I joined the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
I've dealt with very difficult clients in my career in the public accounting sector as well as with&#13;
very difficult staff or managerial situations, and I think those were two very important elements&#13;
that helped me deal with, or prepare myself for, the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And this was '94-'9 5?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
MUIS: It was the end of '94. I joined the Bank in February '95.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And this had to do perhaps with the conclusion and recommendations of the [Willi&#13;
W. A.] Wapenhans Report, the next steps?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: No, I think that my appointment had to do with the confusion and embarrassment of the&#13;
adverse publicity as a result of the overrun of the budget on the main complex building. That&#13;
was really what triggered it. The Bank actually before that had never thought about a conceptual&#13;
approach to controls; it was very process driven with no philosophy, and it never had a&#13;
professional accountant as a controller for the 50       that it existed. We have never had an en ~&#13;
             rofessional, alt                                                                  ~ ~&#13;
                                                                                                2&#13;
                                                                                                u&#13;
                                                                                                c:l::&#13;
          The Bank has never had a professional controller, like the IMF [International&#13;
Monetary Fund], which still doesn't have one.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: I'm not sure that they want one.&#13;
                                                                                                &lt;&#13;
                                                                                                0&#13;

                                                                                                ..,         -&#13;
                                                                                                            ~   6&#13;

                                                                                                                ~&#13;
                                                                                                                  :::&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Well, the Bank may not, either. I'm sure there are a lot of people in the Bank who didn't&#13;
want one, either. In the beginning stages I had great difficulties in getting through to the Bank's&#13;
establishment of what a controllership is all about. So that's the long winded answer to your very&#13;
concise question.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: No, that's a fine answer. Now, Lew Preston in his last months was almost absent&#13;
from the Bank. So you came into the Bank when the person you were working for was very ill&#13;
and very much not on the scene?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So when President [James D.] Wolfensohn came in, did he have different&#13;
expectations for you?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: I think Jim at that time took the assumption of good controls as a working hypothesis.&#13;
That was his premise, which I think was quite understandable. I mean, he wanted first to look at&#13;
the business dynamics of the Bank since he was accustomed from his previous jobs to believe&#13;
that there are proper controls in place, also at the Bank. I had very early on a discussion with&#13;
him and told him that this was not altogether the case so, in other words, that we had a major&#13;
problem. And I had written my kind of "opening balance sheet" within two months after I&#13;
joined. And one of my notes, I think, to Richard Frank is in the book on the Muis Musings.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Yes, the issues memoranda?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Yeah, the issues memoranda. After two months Controllers also wrote the piece on our&#13;
budget systems and budget controls, which is called "Reinvigorating the Planning and Budgeting&#13;
                                        Jules W. Muis&#13;
                               September 14, 2000- Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  5&#13;
&#13;
Process." That's a very interesting document. That's the only document where I feel the Bank has&#13;
not responded to my concerns. When Jim first came in April 1995, he listened to me.&#13;
&#13;
I only worked with Lew Preston for about two to three weeks, no more. I had a second lunch&#13;
with him in March, and I again told him after three weeks, "Lew, your base opening statement&#13;
that there are no controls at the Bank is not right. There are controls at the Bank; they are just&#13;
too formalistic, process driven. We have done away with thinking; everything is in terms of tick&#13;
marks and process, a process construct which makes it look as if things are under proper control,&#13;
but one is simply missing out on a lot of important stuff. You've got some very good people&#13;
there, but it is not designed in a way controls should actually work." I also discovered very, very&#13;
quickly that if I had to convince the other part of the senior management team, like the MDs&#13;
[Managing Directors], and that I would get absolutely nowhere because I think they were either&#13;
not aware or not serious about the type of controls I was talking about.&#13;
&#13;
And so at my first Audit Committee meeting in March, by surprise I put COSO [Committee of&#13;
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission] on the table (after a first faint and&#13;
failed attempt by Internal Audit in 1994) and basically told the Audit Committee about COSO. I&#13;
told them that it was a controls philosophy drawing from the lessons of the financial calamities in&#13;
the '80s and '90s and that the good thing about COSO is that it recognized that 50 percent of&#13;
good controls is understanding organizational behavior, which was the element missing in the&#13;
Bank's controls. We had all the debits and credits and tick marks, etcetera, under control. On&#13;
paper these looked very good; the flow charts looked absolutely perfect, but if you don't have a&#13;
thinking organization where people not just say, "We've done everything that we should do in&#13;
terms of tick marks," but they also sit and ask themselves, "Well, but is it right?"&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Or effective.&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Or effective. And if people who do that are being labeled trouble makers or wave&#13;
causers--and we don't want waves at the Bank--then you've got the wrong control mentality.&#13;
needed COSO also for a second reason which I did not state at that particular moment, but&#13;
COSO is an empowerment philosophy. It basically gives controllers unfettered access t-o all&#13;
units, which you need to have for a responsible sign off on the financial statements of the Bank.&#13;
Controllers in those days had no substantive access even to Treasury. They had no access to&#13;
Operations. It just was locked into its own box, an aggregation function with a Chief Accountant&#13;
as driver, not a Controller.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Didn't interface with many other units in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Right. It was locked into its own box and basically ticked and checked. It was an&#13;
aggregation function of everything else that came out of--for controls purposes--a very&#13;
decentralized Bank, with each unit having their own controller with no reporting lines to a&#13;
central controller, which explains the controls dynamics metaphor used by one of my accounting&#13;
directors: "Twenty dogs wagging one tail or twenty tails wagging one dog?" And I realized that&#13;
                                          Jules W. M uis&#13;
                                September 14, 2000- Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     6&#13;
&#13;
I would never get where I needed to be through normal negotiations because fragmentation was&#13;
so embedded in the culture of the Bank. It was so part and parcel of the power base of the Bank&#13;
that I had to have a concept with which I could actually say, "Listen, guys, this is my signing off,&#13;
the only sign off I have on the financial statements, and I'm taking it seriously. And I will not&#13;
sign off to my President, my auditors, the Board [ofExecutive Directors] or the Audit Committee&#13;
unless I'm satisfied that I understand what's going on underneath."&#13;
&#13;
And so when the Audit Committee--not yet quite understanding what COSO meant other than&#13;
my verbal presentation--signed off on it, I didn't have to negotiate essentials with my senior&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
And when Jim Wolfensohn joined he was, of course, very preoccupied with other pressing&#13;
matters. He wasn't even at the Bank at the time we first discussed and agreed on COSO. I did&#13;
mention my COSO push to him in an informal orientation meeting for the new incoming&#13;
president that I had with him in April 1995. I didn't ask his approval. I basically told him that&#13;
it's probably the only major move I've made where I've asked no one's approval but went straight&#13;
to the Audit Committee and made sure that they reasonably understood what it was about. I&#13;
didn't probably explain all the repercussions that it would have, but I knew it was for the good of&#13;
the Bank to have COSO, which at the time was introduced by regulatory imposition to America's&#13;
large banks. So it's not exactly a self-centered or a self-interest inspired move. It was a move&#13;
really in the interest of the Bank, because the Bank did run a tremendousl y high risk in not just&#13;
its weak management controls but also in its financial controls. And if financial controls screw&#13;
up, then the Bank's reputation in the marketplace, as you know, will just go to the dogs. And&#13;
that means higher interest rates and probably a different market rating, and that would be&#13;
absolutely disastrous. I think there were very few people at the Bank at that moment that really&#13;
had the overview and understood the risks the Bank was taking.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Wasn't there a procurement scandal in 1995?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Well, the standard slogan in the Bank was, and Jim Wolfensohn heard it, and I heard it,&#13;
"We've never had any fraud or corruption at the Bank." Informally, people would say, "Well, we&#13;
had a few cases, but then we, you know, we dealt with that internally." And so in terms offraud&#13;
and corruption--I'm not talking about weak controls that could screw up your numbers; I'm&#13;
talking about fraud and corruption--I needed proof; I needed to prove that this state of denial was&#13;
a case of the Emperor's clothes.&#13;
&#13;
We have a processing unit in accounts receivable, accounts payable, expense reports, etcetera,&#13;
where we very early on introduced, through COSO, the concept of a " thinking organization;"&#13;
i.e., do not just check and go through a check list, but actually think, including validity testing as&#13;
it's called. And this was just done by very informal training, helping each other and saying,&#13;
"Let's after each step stand back and see whether it makes sense." And one unit noted a rather&#13;
unusual movement in the accounts receivable/payables of a budget officer in operations. And so&#13;
we had the great luck of finding a fraud at the launching phase of COSO that went back about&#13;

&#13;
eight years. It was a couple of months after I came to the Bank and with some luck discovered&#13;
through my accounting unit. (Frauds and corruption mostly are not uncovered by designated&#13;
controllers or auditors; they're mostly discovered by colleagues). This one was uncovered by&#13;
one of my people probing and questioning intelligently. The fraud concerned a budget officer&#13;
who had run off with about $600,000 over eight years. It's nothing dramatic for the Bank's&#13;
financial statements, but it was an enormously powerful signal and wake up call to the&#13;
establishment of the Bank that the existing structure didn't work.&#13;
&#13;
Yet no one felt responsible. I remember the meetings that I had with Gautam Kaji, Caio Koch-&#13;
Weser and Jessica Einhorn. Jim had just put out all these good words about accountability:&#13;
"We're going to hold people accountable "etc        etcetera. So we looked around the table at&#13;
who's       to be held accountable.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                        ~&#13;
                                                                                                        c:::Â»&#13;
                                                                                                        c-....&#13;
managerial responsibility.                                                                              c-....&#13;
                                                                                                         c:::Â»&#13;
So I said, "I will take responsibility. I mean, I'm the Controller, and ultimately it is my             ~         c:&#13;
                                                                                                        0...      0&#13;
responsibility."                                                                                        &lt;(       -;::1&#13;
                                                                                                                  fr&#13;
This gave me a very powerful lever to put other changes through, such as getting the controllers                 ~&#13;
of the units to report to me and to get the controllers ofthe units to actively take responsibility&#13;
for their budget officers. As already said, there were no sensible reporting lines in place. We&#13;
had decentralized ourselves out of organic existence such that even within the decentralized units&#13;
there was no feeling of responsibility for one another.&#13;
&#13;
So the question then came up in this meeting--1'11 never forget that everybody was going for the&#13;
exits in terms of accountability--"What do we tell Jim, because Jim wants blood?" And, "Jim&#13;
takes this much too seriously."&#13;
&#13;
Jim called the Board in an informal meeting to tell them--which, I think, given the size of the&#13;
fraud, may have been overdone. But then it was the first acknowledged fraud in the Bank, and it&#13;
did hit the Washington Post, etcetera.&#13;
&#13;
So when we were sitting around Jim's conference table and discussing who should take&#13;
responsibility for it and I said, "Well, I'll do it!" there weren't many protests.&#13;
&#13;
And they said, "Well, that sounds very good. The controller takes responsibility for it."&#13;
&#13;
 I could easily do that, even though it went back eight years, originating long before my time. I&#13;
was the new controller, so I had functional responsibility, a concept no one then knew how to&#13;
handle.&#13;
&#13;
So what I did, basically, was to draft myself the note of admonishment that Jim Wolfensohn had&#13;
                                          Jules W. M uis&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   8&#13;
&#13;
to send to me and gave it to Jessica, who changed a few words and then gave it to Jim. I think&#13;
Jim never realized that it was drafted by me. I assume he was never told. And so when the&#13;
president's note was out, personal to me, I distributed it-my own concoction--to the whole of&#13;
the Controller's community and basically said, "This is the way accountability works, and this is&#13;
how it should work." That had an enormous effect in terms of rethinking by each individual, be&#13;
it accountant or controller, on what peoples' responsibilities really are because what happened&#13;
this time to "X" next time could happen to "Y," and especially if it happens to the VP &amp;&#13;
Controller (you know how the power base of the Bank is: the VPs are treated like absolute gods),&#13;
then people would realize that the buck stops at the top. That was one of my nicest experiences&#13;
in the Bank. It was absolutely great because the note that Jim sent, of course, I couldn't argue&#13;
with because I was the one who had drafted it and used the occasion to instill a sense of&#13;
accountability in the whole community. The whole process was so absolutely interesting&#13;
because it really sent shock waves through the organization. After that, just to draw it out&#13;
further, we had of course more cases.&#13;
&#13;
You have to see this all in the context of another move. My most cost-benefit effective move in&#13;
the Bank and for controllers was the introduction of a Letter of Representation. Jim and I were&#13;
asked by the auditors to sign off on a couple of control assertions, just after we arrived at the&#13;
Bank. This was my opportunity to tell my colleagues to take their own responsibility at a time&#13;
when there was still a lot of resistance in bringing the controllers of the Bank units under my&#13;
wings with a "dotted line." And so I basically said to my colleagues the VPs, "Guys, I will sign&#13;
off, but, before I sign off, you sign off for your own units; you've got full responsibility; you're&#13;
responsible for your own units' controls in the same way as the auditor is asking for the Bank as&#13;
a whole." We added some venom in the tail, the very last line of that Letter of Representation;&#13;
paraphrasing the very last sentence, "And nothing has come to our attention that one day may&#13;
embarrass the Bank that we have not shared with you." That is a very effective assertion because&#13;
signatories- hence reputations--are on the line. So there was an incredible outburst; people&#13;
going to Jim complaining, etcetera. And Jim, although he never formally told me that he would,&#13;
backed me for all practical purposes.&#13;
&#13;
And so what happened in the years following is what could be predicted: first, that people would&#13;
lie, just as the internal and external auditors told me they would, "Don't do this, because people&#13;
will lie." And people did lie, I'm sure. They'd put their unqualified signature there as good boys&#13;
and that everything was honky dory, not wanting to cause any waves. And I'm sure that they had&#13;
things and concerns on their minds that they should not have signed off on, unqualified. -But&#13;
over time (one, two, three years) we got more and more qualifications. Last year we had, by&#13;
reference to pending investigations, about 40 qualifications, which is superb. Everybody thinks&#13;
you should have a clean Letter of Representation or a clean audit opinion. I'm basically saying&#13;
that I prefer the qualified audit opinions because there's someone who has thought things out, is&#13;
concerned, and shares those concerns with his colleagues. And so the Letter of Representation&#13;
now is doing its work in the organization and is being cascaded down from VPs to directors and&#13;
some even go to the division chief level, and you're on the line.&#13;

&#13;
And today the Bank has at this moment--I couldn't believe that number; I still think it's&#13;
exaggerated--about 300 cases that are under investigation, which constitute both trust funds,&#13;
lending money, and the Bank's own internal budget. For lending money, one can be a little more&#13;
"cavalier." You have to understand here the control philosophy. The Controller's prime&#13;
responsibility at the Bank is to protect it against "reputational" risks for financial reporting&#13;
purposes in order to make sure that cont~ols for financial reporting purposes, which are big&#13;
numbers, are adequate. I also used to have responsibility when I came into the Bank for the&#13;
budget--we'll come back to that. But I've never signed off over the last five years for adequacy&#13;
of controls for management purposes, which includes efficiency and effectiveness, in practical&#13;
terms.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: But you've signed off for financial reporting purposes?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Yes, I've signed off for financial purposes even though I knew our weaknesses in&#13;
controls for lending purposes where operationally we had dropped the ball. We totally dropped&#13;
the ball in following the money, our lending money. Yet I could sign off because basically my&#13;
interest as a controller for the balance sheet is not whether the money is well spent by our clients,&#13;
but whether we get it back. And basically, for IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Development] we do get our money back. We've had a few cases, workout cases, where we got&#13;
it back with some difficulties. But I've always kept an interest in the downstream part of our&#13;
money because I'm responsible for the Loan Department that disburses the money, and in the&#13;
spirit of the same COSO, I don't just want to tum the switch off and on solely based on what&#13;
Operations tell me to do. So I basically told our people, "We have to do the same amount of&#13;
thinking for disbursements." I don't want to be a controller that just mechanically signs off based&#13;
on whatever other people tell me to do, because then I'd rather have the disbursement department&#13;
somewhere else. "Downstream controls" is a whole story by itself.&#13;
&#13;
Administrative budget, treasury, and lending money are the three main component parts of the&#13;
controls construct. Fraud and corruption represent the noise in the system. The Bank now has a&#13;
mountain of problems and cases under investigation. This is in part triggered by a much more&#13;
controls-driven attitude that came with COSO, a new President, and signing off on a Letter of&#13;
Representation. People kind of knew that the first time they got away and with Jules Muis being&#13;
on the receiving end of window-dressing assertions, but everyone realized that ultimately&#13;
everyone's reputation would be on the line unless they acknowledged reality. That came in very&#13;
slow motion, and we're still not there. I still think you've got niches, important niches perhaps,&#13;
where people think, "Well, we've now a new controller for five years, and we'll sit him out, and&#13;
let's see what will happen next." Basically, I think we've had a real change in people realizing&#13;
what damage corruption can do and what damage you cause if you just go for the optical effects&#13;
of controls and not for substance, how you mortgage future generations of the poor if you do not&#13;
make sure someone follows the money.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Could we just go back to your early relationship with Jim Wolfensohn? Obviously&#13;
he was preoccupied with other things.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: When, so to speak, did what you were doing register on his screen?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: I think the first fraud case registered. The exception that we put on the table registered&#13;
on his screen. The fraud case was one, and then there were more, such that we set up a special&#13;
investigatory unit. I think that he was extremely slow on management reporting and on the&#13;
budget and actually allowed himself to be bulldozed by his MDs, late 1995, into taking the&#13;
budget out of Controllers. And I'll come back to that, because that was for me probably the&#13;
biggest disappointment, that I never had a chance to get our old "PBD," as it was called&#13;
(Planning and Budgeting Department), which is now "CRM" [Corporate Resource&#13;
Management], under quality management. I think there was a coup, more or less at the end of&#13;
my first year, in 1995, when Jim appointed Managing Directors and started reorganizing some of&#13;
the units. And he took the budget away from Controllers and put it under a new VP, close to his&#13;
office, with a broader charter, and honoring half of what I'd asked for, as I had argued right from&#13;
day one that the Bank had no strategic planning at the base of its budget. Planning and&#13;
budgeting are each other's natural extension. It's a matter of inventorying the strategic options&#13;
from the top, then you operationalize it, make the trade-offs, cost it out, get your options lined&#13;
up, and you make your choices. But I think there were too many old guards who didn't want my&#13;
boys and my hand in that process. I'm just speculating. No one ever told me about the rationale&#13;
of the move. Jim never told me. I got the news first through rumors and then through Jessica&#13;
Einhorn. No one ever told me why Budget was taken out of Controllers. I think it had a lot to do&#13;
with the fact that that year I had already started harping very loud about the excesses in our&#13;
benefits system, in particular on salary levels and pensions; not a very popular theme !&#13;
&#13;
I triggered the pension change and also the change in the whole quasi-market-driven benefit&#13;
schemes. Recognizing that eighty percent of the Bank's staff have--it's unmentionable at the&#13;
Bank--a commodity skill function, not a unique, market-premiumed position, from secretaries to&#13;
economists (well, many of the economists), since staff have no professional exposure and very&#13;
long term accountability horizons, to me you're basically in an academic job, except for those&#13;
who are out in the trenches. I think a lot of those are under-paid. You have some very&#13;
courageous people out there, particularly now. I think you've got a new generation of country&#13;
directors who actually are very, very different from the previous ones, who speak their mind and&#13;
follow the courage of their conviction. So I would make an exception for those, but there are&#13;
hundreds, if not thousands, of economists at the Bank who just do routine analytical/research&#13;
jobs, as in academia. They wouldn't get that same money in any academic setting. Or take the&#13;
secretarial functions where a veteran secretary can go home with $55 ,000 net, plus benefits.&#13;
Plus, if he or she stayed long enough with the Bank (e.g., 30-35 years), they will go home with&#13;
close to a net pension--life-long indexed--of about $50,000 plus which cannot be called "market-&#13;
driven." Any one walking around here in Washington knows that you can get secretaries for half&#13;
that salary. And so I started bringing that out and challenging it.&#13;

&#13;
I think too many people simply didn't want my nose in it. And I forced my hand then on the&#13;
pension part because pensions were and are scandalous for a poverty-fighting institution. I had&#13;
my impact on the benefits part in that we did do a review of the benefits, etcetera. And I&#13;
appreciate the fact that you can't change things from one day to another. Now we have a new&#13;
system and a new consultant working on our salary/benefits comparator scheme, so we're slowly&#13;
"tinkering" it to more realistic proportions. But, you know, this year there is an eight percent .&#13;
average salary increase of what I consider to be--for a public or a private institution-already&#13;
eighty percent of grossly overpaid staff.&#13;
&#13;
Moving forward on pensions, my voice was heard because the extant system was untenable,&#13;
absolutely untenable! The jury is still out on the legacy scheme, but I think no one wants to&#13;
"touch" existing staff and their grandfathered rights. I pushed it to a near breaking point to put it&#13;
on the table and make it discussable.&#13;
&#13;
On the budget system, I would just say that we've missed an excellent opportunity. Yes, we&#13;
added a planning dimension, but my criticism is also one of governance. If you make the Budget&#13;
Department reportable to the Planning Department, it's like making the costing department in a&#13;
car manufacturer reportable to the marketing guys or to the design guys. There's a conflict of&#13;
interest built in because the planning and strategic people have all these good ideas but the&#13;
costing or budget people are there to keep them honest. If you have to keep your own boss&#13;
honest, and you have to do that day after day after day after day, it's not going to work. And so&#13;
from a governance perspective I've always criticized that construct. I think the budget/costing&#13;
part should be under Controllers, keeping us honest in our cost assessments, and the (strategic)&#13;
planning part should actually be very close to the President's office.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So after you ended up on Wolfensohn's screen, did he see what you were trying to&#13;
do as part of his larger effort to renew and remake the organization?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Yeah, I think so. I did not bother him too often; I tried to keep my own pants up. I think&#13;
he also liked the total directional setting of Controllers, but there are also big egos involved in&#13;
this. Sometimes I had the feeling that there was some competitiveness. And Jim never knew&#13;
quite what to do with me; he never knew how to read me. I don't think he had many vice&#13;
presidents that told him what they thought. I had the freedom to do that because I had a five-year&#13;
term, and you're better protected with a five-year term than with an open ended contract. It's as&#13;
simple as that. And I hadn't joined the Bank to sell my soul. I joined the Bank under very&#13;
difficult circumstances with a very difficult challenge, and so I did not want to give away my&#13;
leverage and my empowerment. Jim is a robust personality, but I think he liked the general&#13;
direction I took. I think he may have seen me--l described it in one of the papers- as being an&#13;
"isolated thunderstorm in his global hurricane," which I still think is probably an apt description.&#13;
There may have been a few times where he made some comments that he was the first, et cetera,&#13;
as on anti-corruption, and that's fine. The truth ofthe matter is that neither he nor I were the first&#13;
tackling corruption. I had commissioned my personal assistant to look into (anti-) corruption&#13;
before he joined in June' 95, without asking anyone's approval, but he was the first in senior&#13;

&#13;
management to push the issue externally and courageously. I always felt with Jim a little bit of a&#13;
sense that he wants to be seen for having invented everything new in the Bank. So I just did my&#13;
ground work. And the advantage of my anti-corruption report--or the "C Word," as it was titled-&#13;
-was that it was documented evidence of a broad range of solid opinions within the Bank, that&#13;
there were many more problems out there than we were willing to admit, and that corruption was&#13;
a problem and a non-discussable in the Bank at that time.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: One of the things that Wolfensolm has been trying to do is to decentralize the Bank's&#13;
operations. How does COSO fit into that?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Did you get the ten theses that I sent to Jim Wolfensolm at the very beginning of my&#13;
tenure? Jim asked me at one point in time to give him some food for thought--! think for his&#13;
vacation early in 1995--so I sent him 10 main theses.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: You're talking about "The Ten Commandments of the Controller"?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Yeah. There were also ten other issues that I sent him, a one-pager in April or May,&#13;
which he asked for with the ten commandments.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: No. We looked over the ones in The Controller's Handbook with the ten&#13;
commandments, also your strategy plan, in light of the strategic compact.&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Right. That's later. No, I sent him an issues paper on the ten main topics in one page,&#13;
and one of them was decentralization. I basically said that if you fight a global war on poverty,&#13;
you shouldn't assemble 90 percent of your troops in one square mile in Washington. So I fully&#13;
agree with the decentralization concept. I think there are dangers involved in having resident&#13;
missions where people go too quickly and too easily native and therefore there are control&#13;
concerns, but those control issues are no different from running a public accountant's practice.&#13;
mean, if your partners in Delhi or wherever go native and actually are more truthful towards their&#13;
environment than to the partnership as a whole, then you've got a problem. And so you have to&#13;
manage that problem. And the only way to manage that problem is by knowing exactly what's&#13;
happening there, by having a bit of countervailing power in your system in order to make sure&#13;
that doesn't happen, have adequate quality control, and by choosing the right people. Then at&#13;
least you have people who have something to offer, which is not the 6000 mile away view from&#13;
prosperous Washington, but people who know what it is like living in the trenches. And so I've&#13;
always been in favor of decentralization.&#13;
&#13;
I think he's done it like everything else, as often his decisions, because of the weaknesses of his&#13;
own entourage, were taken without any consultation with Controllers. So we could have done it&#13;
more efficiently; however, as a governance and business process change I fully support it. But it&#13;
was not an orderly process as he unknowingly took risks, I think. He may not even have known&#13;
that Controllers hadn't been involved. But I think the business change was very, very important.&#13;
For Controllers it was rather a minimalist change because I can control the resident missions'&#13;

&#13;
administrative costs for financial reporting purposes in a global sense without too much&#13;
difficulty. But for PBD/CRM, for management control purposes, it's much more difficult. And&#13;
so we've been busy with pushing the toothpaste back in the tube in terms ofretro fitting these&#13;
business changes such that its design will include control considerations; which was not the case&#13;
when launched.&#13;
&#13;
So I think that's typical Jim. He's an excellent visionary. I think he even oversells the Bank to&#13;
the point that the resultant expectation gap is becoming pretty dangerous because the "troops"&#13;
have difficulties following him. But he is not a good internal manager, and he knows that! And&#13;
he still doesn't understand all my comments on "governance," for instance. That you can find&#13;
back in the COSO Report.&#13;
&#13;
The end product of the COSO process is called the COSO Report. Read the report because you'd&#13;
be very interested to see that there is no other organization that has such frank self-&#13;
criticism/assessment. The COSO Report-a bottom up product reflecting the controls concerns&#13;
of many--says virtually all the right things; inter alia, that the president should have an Executive&#13;
Committee. Jim himself signed off on it! I didn't want to sign the COSO Report by myself as a&#13;
Controller because I thought it should have senior management endorsement. It contains all the&#13;
things that I think still should happen, like the Bank having an Executive Committee so that you&#13;
have collective responsibility at the top, so that not all problems roll immediately into the front&#13;
door of the President's office, that the senior management team has to take responsibility for one&#13;
another, and specifically that Jim can't take fluke initiatives that balloon out of control with no&#13;
one being made responsible. It's all in there, and all the other issues on the Bank's weaknesses on&#13;
enterprise-wide risk management which we have now finally started. These were all flagged&#13;
three or four years ago!! They are now finally being recognized as the root for the resource&#13;
management weaknesses we have, but considered risk taking in a proper governance construct is&#13;
still not being forcefully addressed.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Where in the Bank, aside from your office, is there interest in this governance issue?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: There should be, obviously, in Jim's. And I think there is, at least with three or four&#13;
MDs, serious concern. Actually, for the first time I feel that, for instance, people like Sven&#13;
[Sandstrom] see me as an ally on that issue. I know definitely Shengman [Zhang] does.&#13;
Mamphela [Ramphele] I don't know; she hasjustjoined. Peter Woicke I know too little about;&#13;
would probably agree with that. Jeff [Jeffrey A.) Goldstein I can't read on this particular score,&#13;
but I think in his heart of hearts he agrees. I've seen him change over the last couple of months&#13;
because he is faced with the consequences of a governance construct resembling the Mexican&#13;
army. I think that Jeff was more or less brought in to become kind ofthe "de facto CEO [chief&#13;
executive officer]." I think that he has come to the conclusion that he can't pull that off by&#13;
himself and that a normal governance construct would help. Those are the dynamics from the&#13;
top where I have limited information; where I can only speculate, but from all the signals I get&#13;
back, the majority ofMDs would want a governance construct for an orderly process. And I&#13;
even think that at this moment Jeff Goldstein also thinks that it would be a good move. This is&#13;

now also being supported by Kathy [Katherine] Sierra's report on risk management at the Bank.&#13;
They basically all have come to the conclusion that we can only have proper risk management if&#13;
there's proper ownership at all levels.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: In implementing COSO, this required an increase in staffing, especially professional&#13;
accountants and all. How easy or difficult was that to affect?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Well, it should have been difficult, but it wasn't. And so the part where I haven't really&#13;
screamed that hard--other than flagging it very, very visibly--is that the Bank really reneged on&#13;
its initial agreement with me before I joined, in terms of resources. I've had in my Accounting&#13;
Department a de facto budget cut of about 20 percent over those five years, this all in the wake of&#13;
major control calamities, major skeletons of the past, a new controls philosophy and a&#13;
tremendously changing Bank. I could and would not get angry about it. There was so much fat,&#13;
also in the controls area, that a lot of what my managers have done is basically convert that fat&#13;
back into muscle and brains. To tum a non-thinking organization back into a thinking one&#13;
doesn't require more budget but empowerment, focus, spine and professionalism, which was all&#13;
there to be tapped.&#13;
&#13;
Basically we had excellent people in Controllers. And my role was to empower them and to&#13;
bulldoze the internal barriers which were there and to allow them to tum into full-fledged&#13;
professionals, give them wings, so to speak. And that's really what I did for very little money,&#13;
actually, with a contracting budget, thanks to my excellent managers who were basically in&#13;
control of that process and who followed it through. They never had one extra penny to&#13;
implement COSO, never. I had a front office when I came in of 105 people which were niches&#13;
of dissatisfied people, remnants of old conflicts within the VP. Some of those 105 have been&#13;
laid off; most were part of the restructuring effort, of course. I could say at my farewell&#13;
reception, "I now have four women left, and I didn't even have to change my religion for it!"&#13;
&#13;
So ifthe question is budget and COSO, COSO is an unfunded mandate throughout the Bank, one&#13;
of the many unfunded mandates of the Bank. I think it was doable at the expense of a lot of hard&#13;
work by my managers because the real pain didn't come from the budget; it came in getting the&#13;
mentality changed in an orderly fashion without using too many bazookas. I have had some&#13;
confrontations which would be absolutely unthinkable in any normal organization. And what I&#13;
take with me as professional satisfaction is that I think I've resolved them all--maybe except for&#13;
one--in a quiet fashion that didn't spill over into the rest of the world or didn't unnecessarily spill&#13;
over into the Bank as a whole. It was, of course, always known within the MD group. And, as I&#13;
said, from this moment, as people look back--even the people who thought that I was the worst&#13;
thing that had ever happened to the Bank- they look back with a degree of after-the-fact&#13;
recognition that it has protected us all.&#13;
&#13;
We found calamities in the Treasury Department in 1998 which were absolutely mind boggling,&#13;
such as $500,000,000 plus of accounting errors accumulated over the past 15 years. By fluke&#13;
rather than design, the errors happened to closely offset each other as you had about 350 million&#13;

&#13;
one way and between 250 and 300 million the other way. And we absorb $50,000,000 for&#13;
financial reporting purposes, but for management control purpose it was, of course, horrible!&#13;
Absolutely horrible! Treasury had to do its job with lousy systems--which we identified right&#13;
from day one--as well as too many nonqualified people making erroneous accounting judgments.&#13;
&#13;
That was the problem of the Bank: we had no sense ofwhat a good professional should look like&#13;
or how he/she should be organized/quality managed.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: In the larger issue that you talked about in some of your speeches and so on, and&#13;
also COSO talks about, efficiency and effectiveness, is this a matter of getting a handle on&#13;
financial control?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What needs to be done to improve, from a controller's point of view, efficiency and&#13;
effectiveness?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: When you just limit the discussion on the Bank's reputational risk to the context of its&#13;
relevance to the financial statements, I think the main findings were that, yes, there is fraud and&#13;
corruption at the Bank, but it's not material to the financial statements, and that's a very&#13;
important caveat. And yes, we had a major "ball's up," slow motion, starting fifteen years ago in&#13;
accounting for derivatives and everything else, particularly so for financial instruments, but that&#13;
was manageable too. And so the judgment call that I had to make three or four months after I&#13;
joined the Bank, of signing off on the accounts, was that yes, we've got weaknesses but they're&#13;
probably not big enough for financial reporting purposes, a call which proved to be right, but by&#13;
fluke not by design, because had this affair worked the other way around--in other words, if all&#13;
arrows had gone in the same direction--then half a billion dollars is a lot of money, and you'd&#13;
have to tell the world. So basically we were lucky there, and I could have been proven wrong in&#13;
my judgment when signing off. I took that calculated risk because I had no choice and there&#13;
were no indications of errors of this magnitude after 50 years of clean audit opinions, and I was&#13;
just as lucky as the Bank in this respect. Everything else are control issues that do not affect the&#13;
financial statements as such, like efficiency and effectiveness. We can talk about that in terms of&#13;
the administrative budget where my main concern was price efficiency in the first place; i.e.,&#13;
efficiency of our eighty percent cost category in our income statement which is staff benefits and&#13;
where I had two focal points: the benefits system itself on salaries and the added benefits, which&#13;
was more fringe issues, particularly on pensions.&#13;
&#13;
On the pensions there were three issues. I thoroughly disagreed with the actuarial basis on which&#13;
we took the money out of the Bank through premium contributions in favor of the pension fund,&#13;
particularly against the background of a virtually invisible surplus that we build up over many&#13;
years of which everybody would say, "Well, yes, that's because of good investment policies."&#13;
And I kept saying, "No, it's also because we basically hoard the Bank by an actuarial method&#13;
called the 'open group method' which meant that you start setting money aside for future&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   16&#13;
&#13;
employees." I've never seen any organization where you would do that. I helped kill that ritual.&#13;
We had to challenge management, the actuaries, and everybody else and said, "Listen, you know&#13;
this is totally irresponsible for an organization like the World Bank, a poverty fighting&#13;
organization. We should go back to normalcy, which is to provide for the real costs, and I don't&#13;
care if you do that moderately prudent for existing employees, but not for future employees."&#13;
&#13;
So we changed that, and with that the level of funding dropped. And we also got a much better&#13;
view of the real surplus in the pension fund, which now is approximately four or five billion&#13;
dollars. Do you need more than four or five billion dollars in surplus? So we forced the Bank to&#13;
listen carefully to U.S. GAAP [Generally Accepted Accounting Principles], which tells you to&#13;
plow that money back into the Bank over time. This is now a substantial accounting credit you&#13;
will find in IDA [International Development Association], IFC [International Finance&#13;
Corporation] and IBRD's financial statements that adds up to between four and five hundred&#13;
million dollars a year. I think by the time I left the Bank we had plowed back, in an accounting&#13;
sense, close to two billion dollars of excess pension money into the Bank Group's income&#13;
statements. The money will follow much slower, because a majority basically felt that this&#13;
"credit" is not useable capital. If we were to use their argument for the rest of the balance sheet,&#13;
the balance sheet would look vastly different. That's why we have accrual accounting. Anyway,&#13;
that was a major issue that caused major grief.&#13;
&#13;
The other was the issue of the pension benefits itself and the way that we gross it up for tax&#13;
purposes. This is an accountability issue. It's still under review by the Audit Committee after&#13;
three years. I have now repeated reference to its lack of resolution for three years in the COSO&#13;
Report. I think it's a major reputational risk for the future of the Bank, still. To the credit of the&#13;
Bank, we've changed the system moving forward two years ago, and the IMF has not. And I&#13;
think they are in much bigger trouble than we are. On this one I really felt pretty bad because&#13;
there's such a disconnect between the way that we calculate the taxes and the real taxes that are&#13;
payable, so you have a windfall in between. And you have to fix that in some way or another.&#13;
And so it has been a very, very hot issue, because we basically converted the system into a veiled&#13;
benefit scheme rather than an open post-retirement benefit scheme. You cash in on it sooner or&#13;
later. It was essentially a non-advertiseable benefit scheme, because you couldn't tell people&#13;
when they come in that, yes, we have a pension scheme that actually will give you a non-&#13;
discussable windfall when you leave. You can't do that. So that's a major contingent&#13;
reputational risk issue that I just want you to remember in so far as it is reflected in the COSO&#13;
Report.&#13;
&#13;
There's still a formal call to be made by the Board on the validity of the old scheme. And that's&#13;
what I've forced out in the open, keeping it above the table by basically saying, "You can't&#13;
grandfather a scheme which is called ' scandalous' by the President and the Board. You can't&#13;
grandfather a scandalous system. You can of course grandfather its outcome, but only for the&#13;
right reasons!" And that means that one of those reasons may be that we can't reverse it because&#13;
it's been in place for so long and staff expect to get it. I think it is, for all practical purposes,&#13;
irreversible, but it doesn't mean that you shouldn't give it a try and certainly have a due process&#13;

&#13;
validating or rejecting it. You shouldn't just let it "go" by default. But I seem to be the only one&#13;
holding that view.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Are there other efficiency and effectiveness issues that you think still need to be&#13;
addressed?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: I think that the salary base still is not market-driven. The first phase change in our&#13;
benefits scheme was simply 80 percent cosmetic. Yes, we went to another consultant for a new&#13;
comparator, and we now call it "market-driven." But the only way that the Bank can get to a&#13;
benefit scheme that is efficient is by having a proper functional analysis of what each one of us&#13;
does, such as what a secretary, an accountant, or an economist really does, what their&#13;
occupational exposure is, whether it is a commodity skill position, and is there a market here in&#13;
Washington to fill that post or do we have to go somewhere else. The Bank's main mortgage in&#13;
ever getting real change through is hampered by these golden handcuffs, working with people&#13;
who, because of their G-4 status, have actually very little other options.&#13;
&#13;
Staff really have two barriers that cause them to be afraid of change. The first is that it's not very&#13;
attractive if you've got your kids here, if only for a couple of years, and your job is at stake. I've&#13;
only too slowly started understanding that. Secondly, if in addition to that, you lose a job that&#13;
you couldn't find anywhere else, even here around Washington, in terms of pay and everything&#13;
else, then you've got a double whammy of a problem which makes people reluctant to any kind&#13;
of change. I've been a member of the Staff Association for five years, and I've never--informally&#13;
or formally--said, "If you guys would really let me loose, I would sweep the floor with you. You&#13;
don't realize what a good employer the Bank is." To the point that I, as the ex-Controller, say that&#13;
our benefits still are irresponsible.&#13;
&#13;
So if the Bank were ever to do a proper functional analysis of what each one of us does, then you&#13;
will have a base for assessing realistic salary levels. As long as you don't have the courage to d ~      5&#13;
that, don't talk about "market-driven" salaries. It's as simple as that. Then there's an important  t:C  ~&#13;
other efficiency and effectiveness issue, historically, that you might not have heard of/about. s~ &lt;= \\.)&#13;
                                                                                                  . cno o::&#13;

You should talk to Barbara Opper. There's an important issue that                      and I had a =:~ &lt;C :;::~&#13;
                                                                                                             fr&#13;
regrettable run-in on very early on which was on debt funded liquidities. There's a paper on that.           ~&#13;
I think we changed it in 1997. Basically, the Bank for years invested short and borrowed                    tiJ&#13;
medium term, which means that you have basically a negative spread. And that was an issue that&#13;
lingered on from the late '80s for about six to seven years. For years, there are two competing&#13;
schools ofthought and no winners. Barbara Opper, for instance, used to quote the Chinese&#13;
laundry man, "If you invest short and borrow long, you loose your shirt." The differences&#13;
between those two schools meant-according to some- billions of dollars for the Bank if you've&#13;
got a liquidity portfolio of20-25 billion dollars.&#13;
&#13;
That's an issue that I've forced to some kind of a conclusion by putting it on Jim Wolfensohn' s&#13;
table with a note directly to him and who didn't take long to think it through. I have not often&#13;

&#13;
used the privilege of having a direct reporting relationship to the President on issues I thought&#13;
important enough and so occasionally jumping over my peers, but on this one I couldn't see eye&#13;
to eye with my direct boss (as I couldn't on pensions either, but where in the end Jessica was of&#13;
great help and basically agreed). But on the issue of debt funded liquidities she simply didn't&#13;
want to have it on Jim's desk, to the point of telling me to rewrite my note to him. So I had to&#13;
tell her that I don't write notes to the president in order for them to be rewritten. The upshot was&#13;
that Jim dealt with it very astutely.&#13;
&#13;
And I think, by just looking at it, the "Opper School" won out, belatedly. You leverage your&#13;
AAA debt rating based on matched asset/liability maturities; that' s how you make a little bit of&#13;
money. But you don't pay negative rates ad infinitum.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, that was a very costly Bank non-decision that lingered on for years and years, and&#13;
today we are still paying off the "mortgage" that goes with it because you can't de facto liquidate&#13;
that old portfolio from one day to the next without cost. That was a most important,&#13;
unconventional efficiency and financial effectiveness issue that I came across. You could also&#13;
really define it as an efficiency issue that cost the Bank a lot of money, if you believe the&#13;
winning school of thought which claims that it could have been changed much earlier. Barbara&#13;
Opper has been the champion of that.                                          Â·&#13;
&#13;
For the rest on "efficiency and effectiveness," the main tickets are the proper use of the Bank's&#13;
"downstream" money, the Bank's main, traditional, core contribution to development. It boils&#13;
down to the 20-30 billion dollars that are pushed out of the Bank through the Loan&#13;
(disbursement) Department. It didn't take me too long, about a year, to figure out how process-&#13;
driven it was. I initially had felt that the Loan Department was the most efficient machinery that&#13;
I had . There were never any mistakes, and everything ticked and everything balanced, until we&#13;
had double payments in Africa and noticed how little thinking there was involved in the process.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Is this then the origins of what is the Loan Administration Change Initiative&#13;
(LACI)?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Yeah, that's LACI. It's now called FMIS [Financial Information Management System].&#13;
I've never learned that acronym because I felt so comfortable with LACI.&#13;
&#13;
The LACI initiative really had to do with the Bank's integrity in lending, which is probably the&#13;
term that I would prefer to use. There are only two ways for the Bank in looking at its lending&#13;
operations: it's either an investment for, or a mortgage on, future generations. If it doesn't&#13;
disburse it responsibly it mortgages future generations of the poor, and so the Bank has a duty of&#13;
care, reflected in the Articles of Agreement, Article 3, which tells the Bank it is to make sure that&#13;
its money is being used for the purpose intended. We had totally dropped the ball on that one.&#13;
We had done away with all the accountants in this process in the late ' 80s/early ' 90s. The Bank,&#13;
as you know, has been, and probably still is, lending-volume driven in terms of its performance&#13;
indicators. People causing waves or asking questions that might interfere with that process were&#13;

&#13;
not particularly appreciated. And I didn't want to be heading for five years a machinery that was&#13;
just performance measured by the volumes it pushed out without asking too many questions on&#13;
development effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
And so the first thing I did as a member of senior management was to make corruption&#13;
discussable through the "C Word" report in the summer of 1995. But corruption is not the only&#13;
drawback. You can have a lot of inefficiency in development if you simply don't care or don't&#13;
want to see what's happening. And so we started looking at the potential contribution of&#13;
financial project management as a development booster so that, basically, as a task manager you&#13;
are able not just to look at the histories of a project by looking at your own disbursements, which&#13;
is circular, but by looking first at data that makes sense for disbursements decision-making.&#13;
And, in the meantime, you create some capacity building challenges with clients, too, because&#13;
they too have to go through a process which is relatively new and less antiquated; it reveals&#13;
capacity and skill problems, but you start building capacity, which they need anyway, basically&#13;
for their own development.&#13;
&#13;
soÂ· LACI was born, not without great difficulties. I wrote a letter to Jim Wolfensohn in 1996 on&#13;
where I thought we stood with proper financial project management and the fact that the Bank&#13;
had totally dropped the ball. Gautam Kaji responded to Jim Wolfensohn, basically telling him&#13;
that I was full of non-sense- to put it politely--and so on. This was the acting president telling&#13;
the president. Gautam saw me as this new guy coming in and telling extant management all sorts&#13;
of things they did not want to hear. He and I ultimately developed a pretty good relationship.&#13;
Jim picked up on it, albeit very slowly. I had to do my own pushing and pulling. But in the end&#13;
I also told the Board that the present situation--! used enough euphemisms--is totally&#13;
"untenable"; if anyone ever wanted to challenge the Bank and simply took it, with reference to&#13;
Article 3, to the courts or to the [Administrative] Tribunal, we would not have a leg to stand on.&#13;
We have no leg to stand on, aside from the fact that it is not just an accountability issue but a&#13;
development issue.&#13;
&#13;
So I got the task managers together, a group of three times twenty-five, and did a COSO exercise&#13;
on them as a group, basically asking them questions on whether they could read balance sheets&#13;
and financial statements. And they were very frank in that they simply didn't have the capacity&#13;
and the skills. So everybody was pretty frank about not knowing what was going on underneath&#13;
and about not having the transparency it takes to insure proper project financial management. So&#13;
with the [Strategic] Compact money we hired an adequate number of accountants who actually&#13;
could start doing the work so that we could go through the learning curve, moving forward, and&#13;
at first only for project financial management. I think the fact that we've done this has been the&#13;
saving grace for the Bank when the GAO [U.S. General Accounting Office] came in to access&#13;
Bank controls because at least they saw us do something. We would have looked totally&#13;
ridiculous had we not at least made these preemptive moves in the right direction.&#13;

&#13;
MUIS: The first debate started in '96 with the Loan Department taking the initiative. It took&#13;
about a year for me to discover that we had a real problem. It took another year to get the&#13;
problem recognized in the Bank, and it was a very heated debate. And then it took about one or&#13;
two years in getting partial remedial action in place, because we were so short of people who&#13;
actually knew what it was all about.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Isn't this a prerequisite for Wolfensohn's concept of the Comprehensive&#13;
Development Framework (CDF)?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Right. Totally. Actually everything that was so hotly discussed is by coincidence a&#13;
perfect fit with the CDF, which I think is a supreme concept. And I've joked about it in my&#13;
farewell speech somewhere, basically saying, "Where were we for two generations, all these&#13;
brilliant economists? Why did it take an Australian ex-lawyer only two weeks to figure out how&#13;
it's all put together?" Because the CDF concept is just very, very logical.&#13;
&#13;
And yes, now all these things look like perfect fits, but there was a downside to the way I've&#13;
approached it. Ideally, I should have started with the big picture and then moved to the small&#13;
one. I started with the small picture and moved to the big one. And there was a reason for that.&#13;
By the time we acknowledged the problem, the Asian tigers were roaring like hell and who&#13;
would have been receptive to a Jules Muis coming in having his thirtieth complaint about the&#13;
Bank, saying that "good governance" is an issue and that proper financial reporting at the public&#13;
sector level should be addressed structurally? I wouldn't have had an audience. But I had an&#13;
audience on the micro scale because I could prove that we didn't know what was going on. I&#13;
could prove that by gathering the opinions of task managers through my COSO sessions with&#13;
them--the lack of sign offs--and the audit reports on project financial management. So I started&#13;
with the micro, realizing very well that you may ring fence controls around the project, and the&#13;
only thing you may do in the end is to bring the level of water in the rest of the reservoir up when&#13;
that same reservoir is leaking like hell in non-ring-fenced areas. So I knew that if I were to be&#13;
successful at the micro scale, the macro would have to be addressed at one point in time.&#13;
&#13;
Then, fortunately, the East Asian crisis happened and that brought the Bank back to a macro&#13;
recognition and our economists rediscovering that proper accounting and auditing is an economic&#13;
fundamental. And that brings us back to basically the CDF and everything else, where good&#13;
governance is such a vital prerequisite.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: We want to tum to some ofthe issues outside ofthe Bank such as the impact of the&#13;
Asian financial crisis, which you've just started talking about. What was the impact of the crisis&#13;
on the Bank, and especially from the controller's point of view?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: I think the East Asian crisis will one day be described as the biggest blessing in disguise&#13;
for the good governance movement, as well as for accounting and auditing, basically because the&#13;
economists rediscovered--if not discovered- ( the importance of) good governance as well as&#13;
accounting and auditing as an economic fundamental , which they had totally forgotten in the&#13;

&#13;
euphoria of the East Asian boom. For the Bank this is of tremendous importance. Just look at&#13;
the CDF in recognizing the importance of good institutions in accounting and auditing for viable&#13;
economic and market development.&#13;
&#13;
For me, the link became very clear when I looked at, not just project financial management in&#13;
investment lending but also at the structural adjustment lending that we do and which has a&#13;
number of underlying assumptions that are inherently weak. For instance, the assumption of a&#13;
structural adjustment loan is that we have proper public sector financial systems in place, and yet&#13;
we have never delved very deep to test that assumption, maybe because we were afraid of the&#13;
answer.&#13;
&#13;
Actually, in our structural adjustment lending there is no representation at all nor assurance&#13;
where we ask the clients if they know that their own money is being used for purposes intended.&#13;
And so if you co-mingle that money into systems which have no assurance and which&#13;
reputationally and anecdotally are known to be extremely fragile, if existing at all, the Bank&#13;
again may be in a situation where it mortgages rather than invests, mortgages its future&#13;
generations of the poor rather than invests in the present economies. And so there is an organic&#13;
interfacing between the interests of the Bank and those of its "clients" (if we co-define these in&#13;
terms of future generations and not only in terms of current governments that come and go), the&#13;
Bank having the responsibility to make sure that its money is being used for purposes intended,&#13;
an assurance it can only give if the client itself knows that its own money is being used for&#13;
purposes intended. And we're here street length ahead of anyone who has ever done any&#13;
thinking within the Bank of how all that interacts.&#13;
&#13;
And so when the East Asian Crisis took place and our economists were so surprised to see&#13;
finance houses and whole banks implode-hence whole economies--that just had received a&#13;
clean bill of health from their international auditor, I aired a number of concerns to the world,&#13;
including to the Financial Times, which triggered off an avalanche of questions on the&#13;
functioning of the Big Five (Pricewaterhouse Coopers, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG, Deloitte Touche&#13;
Tohmatsu and Arthur Andersen) as transparency agents in the world, but over and beyond that,&#13;
the functioning of the whole accountancy profession, the importance of transparency, the&#13;
importance of regulation, and the importance of good governance.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
(Begin Tape 1, Side B)&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: And so we looked at the landscape. Unless you've got good institutions in place-&#13;
public and private--which interface with each other in the context of basic good governance&#13;
principles such as checks and balances, transparency, etcetera, and you split that between the&#13;
private and the public sector, and you look at those as two wings of one plane, basically saying,&#13;
"If we don't have both in order, the plane will nosedive," then one realizes that ifyou don't have&#13;
a public sector that's reliable, transparent and accountable, that you'll never have a private sector&#13;
that is reliable, transparent and accountable. So you discover the interfacing between the two.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    22&#13;
&#13;
You add to that a little bit of corruption, not as the main theme but as further turbulence to that&#13;
plane, then it's not so difficult to see how all that interfaces with the interest of the Bank because&#13;
the Bank cannot substitute for all the weaknesses that we have on the macro scale. The Bank&#13;
cannot become the mother of all auditors. We have difficulties enough already in dealing with&#13;
our own internal capacity building which is built on the assumption that externally the client has&#13;
its act together. But if we know that things aren't in order with the client, both in the public as&#13;
well as in the private sector, we should have a view and a voice and definitely transparency on&#13;
the inherent risks. And that's basically what Controllers has done.&#13;
&#13;
As a result, most of the issues that we've put on the table were very commonsensical: asking the&#13;
Big Five firms, "Why do you not have minimum standards?" Why hide behind national&#13;
regulators when the world knows many of them are there just to assure collective window&#13;
dressing? And do not just look at the developing countries; look at Japan! There's a moratorium&#13;
on loan loss provisioning. There are also other accounting treatment moratoriums just to keep the&#13;
Emperor optically clothed. Regulators in many of these countries are in charge of collective&#13;
window dressing and act totally counterproductive to what they are initially set up for. If you&#13;
have that kind of situation you basically have no basis for sustainable development, and so the&#13;
Bank should voice its opinion. And that's basically what we've done.&#13;
&#13;
And one thing leads to another. I think the Big Five started out with actually protesting the&#13;
Bank's views, but at this moment they agree that there is a problem. Basically what happened to&#13;
them is in their last merger wave in the '90s-- and I was part of that--they have given away their&#13;
international name. If you go for one firm, under one name, go at least for one quality--&#13;
minimum quality--allowing for some tailoring at the national level. But do not lend your name&#13;
open-endedly to something which you yourself think is substandard. I basically told them,&#13;
"There is no industry in the world--look at Coca-Cola, McDonalds, etcetera--that would allow&#13;
for a local regulator to decide what their minimum standards should be. It's only the accounting-&#13;
-the integrity--industry that apparently allows that." And I basically said, "Draw a line where&#13;
you say, 'Yes, the regulator may allow a set of financial statements that comply with principles&#13;
with which we don't agree.' But then don't lend your good name to financial statements which go&#13;
so 'low' that it just becomes a tremendous reputational risk to you and a real financial risk to&#13;
international investors."&#13;
&#13;
We had some very lively discussions with them. At one point in time they got very, very angry&#13;
with me when they had proposed what they thought was very, very generous, which is to put&#13;
what they call a " legend" in their audit reports. So you have the standard audit report, and then&#13;
there is a footnote to the audit report which basically says that these accounts are prepared in&#13;
accordance with national standards, which may not be the same as the international readers' own&#13;
standards, as a substitute for avoiding going the opposite way (which is not lending their name&#13;
and going for a local name). So I said, "Now you take McDonalds. Suppose that McDonalds&#13;
wants to open a restaurant in North Korea, and they find the best place in town. And you have&#13;
the ceremonial opening, and everything works, and they perfectly serve the five tourists that visit&#13;
in North Korea. One day McDonalds' boss steps in and finds out that these hamburgers look&#13;

&#13;
absolutely perfect but they're made out of dog meat. Basically, what you're proposing is that&#13;
they put a little label on the door windows saying, 'Our hamburgers have been prepared in&#13;
accordance with the best of traditions of local country cooking which may not be the same as&#13;
your 'mother would do it.' They are not telling the reader what is in the hamburgers." The&#13;
reason they have difficulties doing that is because they have basically given away their name to&#13;
local national practices. There is an enormous disconnect there. And, again I repeat--Ira&#13;
Millstein has said it also in various articles-the accountancy industry is the only business in&#13;
town that says, "We have no minimum standards. We lend our name and we hide behind a local&#13;
regulator in order to validate what we're doing." Now, that is economic distortion that affects the&#13;
credibility of the whole accounting profession,_even in the eyes ofthe economist, even though&#13;
the economist should have known better.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, is this why there's been such resistance on the part of these firms to&#13;
international standards?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Well, they have now moved to back international standards forcefully and constructively&#13;
through IFAC [International Federation of Accountants] to escape their present situation. But&#13;
watch their internal workings; they've given away their name to national practices as these are&#13;
not profit pools--one firm worldwide organizations. These national practices and their partners&#13;
have no self-propelling interest in becoming serious. They use the counter argument that in&#13;
Japan you can only get ten percent of the audit fees you would get in the United States, which is&#13;
true. But then, if you only do five percent of the work, you still have a very good profit margin.&#13;
So many of these local partners are not interested in real change, and yet the firms have to bring&#13;
these local partners--who use their international name--under control. So there's a lot of&#13;
infighting going on in these firms, particularly provoked by our stressing that they should get&#13;
serious. But they haven't gone all the way yet in terms of living by international accounting and&#13;
auditing standards, which means that the product you get is prepared according to the standards&#13;
of the local countries. So you always have to ask yourself: "What's the regulation of that&#13;
country, because you're not telling me anything. You're not telling me that you live by, at a&#13;
minimum, international accounting standards. You're now giving me a little warning sign that&#13;
says that these accounts have not been prepared in accordance with what I'm accustomed to. But&#13;
you're not saying that you really think that they're lousy." Remember, these may be&#13;
powerhouses but with a lot of conflicting internal financial interests.&#13;
&#13;
What we have achieved is, first of all, that it's on the table, and that we had a magnificent&#13;
endorsement from the Financial Times. Also, the editorials caught the eye ofthe SEC [U.S.&#13;
Securities and Exchange Commission] with which we've established a very good rapport. We&#13;
have also been very instrumental in reorganizing IF AC, which is the worldwide body of&#13;
accountancy organizations or accountancy firms, mainly for auditing standards. We told IF AC&#13;
that it is basically a shoestring organization, a club where 90 percent of the members don't abide&#13;
by its own rules and that they should get more and better enforcement mechanisms. We've made&#13;
major progress by having the international firms agree to set up within IF AC a practice section in&#13;
which the members would abide by the rules ofiFAC. So ifyou're a member firm ofthat&#13;
                                            Jules W. Muis&#13;

&#13;
practice section, you sign off on the fact that you will live by the international rules, which is&#13;
taking IF AC out of its very open ended standard setting mode because it's not so difficult to&#13;
come out with quality standards if you know that by tomorrow you don't have to live by them.&#13;
&#13;
For IASC [International Accounting Standards Committee], it is almost the same story. We were&#13;
a major voice in its recent organizational revamp. We've become over the last three years a major&#13;
opinion maker on the international accounting scene where the voice of the Bank counts. Jim&#13;
Wolfensohn has done sterling work on this by voicing his opinion.&#13;
&#13;
And what we've done in terms of conceptualizing the issue is basically making people&#13;
understand that the macro construct of good accounting and auditing has to be seen as two wings&#13;
of one plane, the public and the private sector, so both have to work properly. In the Bank, many&#13;
people still don't understand that. The Bank should understand that ifyou only deal with the one&#13;
and not the other you're simply flying around in circles and ultimately you will crash.&#13;
&#13;
So the Bank has become a thought leader to some extent in this development, catalyzing changes&#13;
in the institutional workings of the accounting profession. The question is whether it wants to&#13;
hold on to that position.&#13;
&#13;
I have now, just before I left, retrained my guns from the private sector on to the public sector. I&#13;
don't know whether you have read my letter of July 12, 1999, to selected Supreme Audit&#13;
Institutions. If you look at the international financial architecture and all the links in that chain,&#13;
it is basically very simple: the analysis actually says that there are all these links--which include&#13;
the development banks- which are all part of the problem and, at the same time, the only part of&#13;
the solution. So we need one another. One of those links is the Supreme Audit Institutions,&#13;
which have basically almost just as important a role in the financial architecture as the Big Five&#13;
but are very much in the shadow of the Big Five. I sent the letter on July 12th when they came to&#13;
the Bank with a request for funding. We presently fund the Supreme Audit Institutions for&#13;
giving training to Auditor-Generals of selected developing countries. They meet on Fiji Island&#13;
and other exotic places, and I'm sure there's a lot of very good training going on. But then these&#13;
guys have to go back home, and as we basically are saying, "Why should we put money into&#13;
training excellent fighter pilots when we know that when they go back to their home base they&#13;
either don't have any fighter planes or they have no fuel for flying?"&#13;
&#13;
Eighty percent of the Supreme Audit Institutions are dysfunctional organizations, very highly&#13;
politicized. In the developing world, they're greatly over staffed and greatly under-paid and&#13;
under-skilled. And they're under tremendous pressure by their own governments to just sign off&#13;
for the sake of signing off and satisfying the Bank. Fortunately, we now find more and more&#13;
courage and independence in their work. Now, if you don't have an institution in a country that&#13;
can ensure that the government knows that its own budget money is being used for purposes&#13;
intended, who are we as the World Bank to assume that it is the case if you don't have one&#13;
institution, independent, properly skilled, in a country that actually can make that assurance?&#13;

&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: So, the main theme here is: what we've done with the Big Five we should also do to the&#13;
Supreme Audit Institutions and the GAOs of this world. And I'm basically telling the fNTOSAI&#13;
[International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions] community that they have no&#13;
compliance teeth; it is a best practice, best effort organization. They have magnificent meetings&#13;
in the world, yet they go home and there is too little enforcement and compliance. And if we as&#13;
the World Bank, in the context of the CDF and in the context of our own accountability, cannot&#13;
rely on the fact that there is at least one institution in a country that is properly skilled and&#13;
independent to give independent opinions on its financial public sector affairs so that the&#13;
government and parliament know that the country's money is being used for purposes intended,&#13;
then we cannot substitute for any such gap. I think the future will tell that that's going to be one&#13;
of the hottest issues to solve because, again, we cannot become the mother of all auditors. The&#13;
Bank would simply over-reach, over-stretch, over-extend, and raise false expectations.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And this is obviously the source of a lot of corruption in all places, without this?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Yes, yes. Where the auditor general himself can be part of the problem. In South&#13;
America last year, press reports added up to about six Auditor-Generals that are either in jail or&#13;
about to go to jail--half probably for the right reasons and half for the wrong reasons. And so&#13;
there are major problems in that area. We keep pumping money in countries where we do not&#13;
even have client representation letters nor a Minister of Finance who actually tells us that he has&#13;
matters under control. That is a major weakness in our lending agreement structure. And even&#13;
when they assure us that they know that their own money is being used for purposes intended,&#13;
there is still no assurance that our own money is being used for purposes intended unless we&#13;
tighten the rules or be very explicit up front to our Board when discussing the CAS [country&#13;
assistance strategy] and loan agreements and what comfort we actually have.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, with the decentralized Bank and more people in the field, do you see then that&#13;
this is a function that needs to be part of World Bank operations in the field ?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Yeah. And there are tools available. Here we come to the country disclosure statement.&#13;
The Bank has excellent diagnostic tools in terms of assessing the auditing and accounting and&#13;
institutional strengths/weaknesses, but it is really an open-ended prayer because if you really&#13;
want a good country assessment you have to look for the equivalent of a " macro audit&#13;
certificate," of signing off on a country's good governance strength. You can hire 10,000 Arthur&#13;
Anderson soldiers for one country. Look at Russia, for instance, and you wouldn't get that&#13;
assurance if you only do it "outside in." So I'm basically saying since it is so open ended and&#13;
since it is so impossible to come to any form of positive assurance and since any assurance we&#13;
give is immediately high-j acked for self-serving purposes- most users erroneously look at&#13;
negative assurance as positive assurance--and if we say we have seen no problems, the reader&#13;
will interpret it that the Bank doesn't have any problems worth noting and, therefore , there are no&#13;
problems. But the Bank can never come to any positive assurance because the field is too big to&#13;

cover "outside in." So I've tried to introduce the Country Disclosure Statement as a very useful&#13;
"inside-out" concept and tool (interestingly, it looks much the same piecemeal as what the SEC&#13;
is discussing with the Big Five for their private sector work).&#13;
&#13;
I'm also saying that the Big Five themselves should put a Disclosure Statement out. They should&#13;
tell the world who they are, what their name stands for, what the financial statements they&#13;
associate their name with stand for, what their internal power structure is, what their decision&#13;
making/governance structure is, just in return for one thing: the privilege of having a public&#13;
function, a monopoly on a public function called "audit." Why shouldn't the supreme agent of&#13;
transparency tell the world who they are, other than through their glossy brochures? And I'm not&#13;
just saying this since I joined the Bank, I've said this when I was executive partner, Europe, with&#13;
Ernst. But there's just too much short-term self-interest for it to fly.&#13;
&#13;
The concept of the Country Disclosure Statement is much the same as the concept of a company&#13;
disclosure statement. You go out to the financial markets, and if you want to tap its money, you&#13;
tell it who you are. You tell it how you're put together, what your risk profile is and how you're&#13;
put together. I'm basically saying we should tell our clients, "If you want to have our&#13;
concessional money, you should tell us who you are. You also should tell us who actuall y&#13;
knows, internally, that your own money is being used for purposes intended and give us&#13;
assurance to that effect. So you give us a Country Disclosure Statement, which has various&#13;
advantages not just to us but also to you because as you write it you will find major holes in your&#13;
bucket, and you'll fix it on your own steam. We, the Bank, will not tell you your imperfections;&#13;
you tell us your imperfections. But we will attach legal jeopardy to any false statements,&#13;
including personal legal jeopardy; otherwise it doesn't work."&#13;
&#13;
So, if a public corporation has to prepare a disclosure statement for the financial markets in&#13;
return for the privilege of giving it money, why shouldn't we, as a concessionallender, not ask&#13;
you who you are, how you're put together, and what assurance you can give us that our lending&#13;
money--and therefore also yours--is being used for purposes intended? It's a very simple&#13;
concept. It will have a major development impact. I'm basically saying it will have the same&#13;
development impact on a macro level as the introduction of COSO had in terms of a micro&#13;
controls impact on the Bank because that's what COSO is based on. It's self- assessment. It is&#13;
bringing things out in the open through people sharing their own problems and concerns. That's&#13;
how the Country Disclosure Statement was born. I'm basically saying that all agents in the&#13;
international financial architecture should do that, including the development agencies.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank is very, very good in this. Three years ago we pioneered what's called the MD&amp;A&#13;
(management discussion and analysis), which you will find in the Bank' s Financial Report where&#13;
we put our heart and mind on the table in terms of our risk profile from a financial perspective.&#13;
Add to that the Bank's financial statements. But we miss one essential piece of information: We&#13;
don't tell the world how and whether we apply Article Three, whether we know that our lending&#13;
money is being used for purposes intended. This goes full circle back to the core question ofthe&#13;
function of the Bank in its lending operations, which is to invest not to mortgage. And the&#13;

&#13;
difference between the one and the other is a very cruel dividing line.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: How has this proposal gone over in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: I had a lot of support at the third echelon management level. I had a lot of mixed&#13;
reactions at peer level. I think the thrust of it all was summarized by Kathy Sierra (Vice&#13;
President, Operations Core Services)--you should talk to Kathy Sierra on this-"Maybe we don't&#13;
want to know. If we were to know, how could we defend our lending towards our own&#13;
shareholders in a lot of the lending programs that we have?" Kathy is a very straight bullet, and&#13;
we've had an excellent rapport on the LACI where she's been a better change agent than I could&#13;
ever have been, and I think she put her finger on it.&#13;
&#13;
Basically, it boils down to a statement I never will forget of a chairman of the then Big Eight&#13;
firm in the'70s when they had all these audit calamities. He said, "One should never be so open&#13;
minded that one's brains pop out!" And it's almost the same with the Country Disclosure&#13;
Statement. If you really want to know what is underneath and really want to make that public,&#13;
would then our authorizing environment not revolt and basically say, "Should we put money into&#13;
this?"&#13;
&#13;
I think our authorizing environment in terms of the governments would probably be hesitant not&#13;
to keep the carousel going. I think the public at large would lose a lot of its foreign aid appetite.&#13;
I think it may have some very big advantages to the Bank and its clients if we were to push this&#13;
forward because it will be a major learning curve for countries to look at themselves in a realistic&#13;
way and fix their shortcomings on their own accord without necessarily telling us. The other&#13;
advantage is that it's not an "outside in" instrument; it's an "inside out" instrument. The "outside&#13;
in" preferred instrument ofthe Bank, CFAAs [country financial accountability assessment]--&#13;
including all other multilateral banks--keeps a bureaucracy self-propelling. Yet "outside in" you&#13;
only see what you see and what you're being told, and many of our own assessors would not&#13;
know what's going on underneath. If you talk about money being used for purposes intended,&#13;
there's no way that you can actually get there "outside in" other than doing a thorough audit,&#13;
again backed by my 10,000 Arthur Anderson soldiers. And even then you wouldn't know. So I&#13;
thillk the Country Disclosure Statement would be a major cost/benefit alternative instrument for&#13;
change ifwe were to accept it.&#13;
&#13;
It's on the table, and I put it on the table for all the participants in IFAD (International Federation&#13;
of Accountancy Development; set up as a discussion platform of all the links in the international&#13;
financial architecture having to do with accounting and auditing). I couldn't push it too hard,&#13;
because I couldn't put the Bank's cards on the table definitely saying we would do it. But it's on&#13;
the table waiting for when the time is ripe. I'm just waiting for another few major calamities to&#13;
happen and it will be on the table again. We're now doing "outside in" CF As (Country Financial&#13;
Analysis) that are so open ended that they will only tell us whether we and the client are making&#13;
progress. It's a good diagnostic tool; inventorying progress, not performance. It doesn't give you&#13;
any assurance. The only way you can get assurance is from the source, with ownership. So I&#13;

&#13;
feel very confident that in five to ten years' time that this may be a concept which will be&#13;
mainstreamed and will become a major building block in the CDF because I don't see how we&#13;
can ever get the governance box in the CDF completed without having that country disclosure&#13;
statement. It simply is not possible because we can't do it "outside in."&#13;
&#13;
I see you smiled?&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Well, how forthcoming will these governments be with the country disclosure&#13;
statements? It seems such a utopian concept. Will it actually happen one day?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: No, they won't in the first instance. But it will be like the Letter of Representation of the&#13;
Bank on COSO, because there will be a social audit. There will be constituency screening, a&#13;
very powerful truth force . These are public documents, and if you put countries into a situation&#13;
to put their articles of belief vis-a-vis reality on the table, you will make the process self-&#13;
correcting. Democracy, or whatever is left of democracy in many of these countries, and second&#13;
opinions will do the rest of the work.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: In non-democratic governments?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Also in non-democratic governments because you have outside opposition. You will&#13;
start a debate. People probably lied the first time that they signed off on the Letter of&#13;
Representation. Or they didn't know. And I think governments will lie-or window dress--the&#13;
first time around. They actually will think, "If the Bank needs this assurance, we'll give them the&#13;
assurance." But you only have to wait and sit them out for one, two or three years. We will have&#13;
ongoing Russian, Ukrainian or African style calamities with money. There's simply no other&#13;
way. We will have new governments coming in that will look at the business of the old&#13;
governments, put the disconnects on the table, and create an historic record. And then the&#13;
question becomes whether or not you're willing to enforce the individual legal jeopardy clauses&#13;
that, I think, should be part of the construct. So it won't be a perfect instrument, but it will be an&#13;
instrument that will have a medium term, slow motion, cleansing effect, and definitely be better&#13;
than nothing- the present state on SALs [structural adjustment loans] or the piecemeal comfort&#13;
emanating from LACI.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: The Asian crisis was such a "heads up" because people had invested, at the Bank&#13;
and elsewhere, so much in the Asian miracle. Clearly, the Bank has the greater advantage in&#13;
terms of exposure, unlike the people who just didn't know that this was a problem, or as you say&#13;
they were just looking the other way?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: I think they were just caught up--with the other development banks--in their own&#13;
euphoria, and there was no one who wanted to be a party-pooper, not even the skeptics. I had a&#13;
golden opportunity to do my LACI the other way around; to start macro, from macro to micro&#13;
rather than micro to macro, which is a much more difficult problem. But we had enough&#13;
difficulties, as I said, on the micro scale to actually get consensus that there was a problem and&#13;

that the Bank is part of the same kind of social ambience just like any other organization is. You&#13;
should look at the good papers that we wrote in the early '90s about the importance of good&#13;
institutions. But we didn't live by it.&#13;
&#13;
And then there are, of course, a lot of the ulterior motives/drivers of the Bank and their&#13;
shareholders. It's not just development; it's sometimes geo-political, sometimes social, and&#13;
sometimes humanitarian. There are a lot of ulterior drivers that we don't want to recognize that&#13;
make us look in a different direction if it suits us, and all that with the consent of the Board&#13;
because the EDs [Executive Directors] are the proxies of the shareholders.&#13;
&#13;
The way that I see the total sociology of the Bank is basically that we have on the one hand&#13;
shareholders who have quasi-altruistic motives to keep the carousel going. A lot of them see a&#13;
tremendous advantage of pumping money into the developing world because it means tit for tat&#13;
employment creation. Part I countries translate everything into employment. That's why also a&#13;
lot of these governments--particularly the German, Dutch and French- have all for so long been&#13;
so hypocritical about bribery legislation. Finally they have made changes to their own&#13;
legislation. In my country you could for a long time go to the Minister of Finance and say,&#13;
"Listen, I have to bribe the minister of finance of Country X with $2,000,000. Can I get&#13;
assurance that this is tax deductible?" And the Minister of Finance would or would not declare it&#13;
tax deductible. I mean, what sort of an example do you set?&#13;
&#13;
So a lot of it has to do with an unwillingness to face reality. The fact that governments are being&#13;
held accountable for employment by their constituency, competing with one another in getting&#13;
part of the cake of development funds. And a lot of it is recycling of money. It's a very cruel&#13;
game that--and here I'm being a cynic--is not just driven by development idealism. A lot of it is&#13;
driven by the fluke of the moment, geo-political or economic self-interest and the lot. Those are&#13;
the co-drivers.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: One thing we haven't really touched on is, internally in the Bank, the EDs. What&#13;
kind of support did you get in the Board?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: I got a lot of optical and a lot of substantive support because, I think, it's a little bit like&#13;
the president. The president doesn't want surprises and doesn't want scandals to happen, and&#13;
therefore you get a lot of support for keeping that from happening. But there is a lot happening&#13;
underneath which is hidden by smoke and mirrors. But if you put solutions on the table, still you&#13;
may get lip service but not necessarily the support. You should follow very closely the&#13;
discussion in the Board now on structural adjustment lending and the fiduciary conditions, and&#13;
you can see people getting cold feet- in particular the Part II countries. It starts with the&#13;
developing world, but I'm sure that some of the developed world are equally vulnerable--I&#13;
declared the Japanese at one point a developing country for accounting and auditing purposes&#13;
and was invited to Tokyo to discuss my views.&#13;
&#13;
In the developed world, good governance is always seen as a virtue. But good governance goes&#13;

&#13;
against the vested interest of 80 percent of the membership of the Bank, and so you'll have a lot&#13;
of natural resistance, not openly but veiled. I mean, it will only become open at the very, very&#13;
end when there are no options left. Therefore, I think the transparency element is so important.&#13;
&#13;
That's why I push, maybe very idealistically, the CDS even though it looks almost like a non-&#13;
starter. But I think if you see what we've done at least in making corruption discussable, making&#13;
transparency discussable should also be a feasible exercise. And if the CDS were to happen, I&#13;
would not mind for about five to ten years keeping the faucet open in terms of Bank lending&#13;
going on in countries where we know we don't have adequate assurance that the money is being&#13;
used for purposes intended; conditional, however, to serious improvement on the government's&#13;
part, because then you are helping.&#13;
&#13;
On the IDA front, I would just like to add one thing in terms of development efficiency. The fact&#13;
is that once you've got the governance--preconditions--in place, you still have no guarantees for&#13;
the money actually being rationally distributed. I think the whole debate that we have now&#13;
between growth and poverty and everything else will key into my only contribution to the Bank's&#13;
strategic future where I've been arguing a lot for differential pricing and, particularly, in IDA&#13;
lending, which is basically 80 percent grants and 20 percent loans.&#13;
&#13;
I'm arguing in favor of loan propositions to the Board that actually are priced at arms-length in&#13;
terms of their risk profile and then "concessional-premiumed" based on a conscious decision of&#13;
what it means to the development of that country or to a project, so that you can see that you&#13;
actually end up with an interest rate of about 25-30 percent which you'll bring down depending&#13;
on how far you want to bring it down based on your development considerations. Take India and&#13;
what the central government does with the money we "lend" India. The central government&#13;
creams off the concessional IDA discount at entry level--80 percent premium-and passes the&#13;
money on to the poor at market price, because our economists have basically argued that if you&#13;
don't do it at market price you distort the markets. I simply think, particularly for countries&#13;
where even the government doesn't know that its own money is being used for purposes&#13;
intended, that this is such an incredible waste of insight in optimally allocating scarce resources.&#13;
In particular, if the same central governments were to build atomic bombs from it with our&#13;
blessing, since we're basically co-financing it with 80 percent out of our own lending money, that&#13;
is also part of the transparency curve that many of the Bank's veterans don't want to see nor&#13;
discuss.&#13;
&#13;
But I've challenged right from the beginning our lending pricing policies, to lend our money to&#13;
the poor at local market rates. I know governments run a currency risk plus other financial risks,&#13;
but to let the government, the central government, run away with the 80% premium without&#13;
questioning their central budget policies and controls is for me a development waste. I would&#13;
want to make the process visible, and it's not unreasonable to question it. But the fact is that too&#13;
often we don't want to see.&#13;

&#13;
what have you learned in trying to redefine the role of the controller in the Bank that you might&#13;
apply to some other institution where you find yourself in a similar position?&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Also, what has the Bank learned in the process? Would you say that there are lessons&#13;
learned within the institution?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: I think the Bank has learned to appreciate--and I am not saying this because I had the&#13;
most wonderful farewell evening last week-many things I tried to. I think the Bank also has&#13;
learned to appreciate the fact that if you have a controller who does no more than keep it just&#13;
ahead of the embarrassment curve--because that's the main contribution that I've made--then&#13;
that's a win too. Also, the Bank can tell the world that we have addressed corruption and here&#13;
are the results. We dropped the ball on borrower accountability in the past and have at least&#13;
made a start picking it up again. We're not doing it all ourselves, but we leverage our voice with&#13;
the accounting profession. That is actually in all of our interest. And the Bank can blame itself&#13;
for having for six years or more so many non-discussables on, e.g., our financial policies, but it&#13;
did address many. The Bank can also tell the world that, yes, we had some real professional&#13;
accounting time-bombs in the Treasury Department in terms of not adequately knowing what we&#13;
were doing, but, most of them have been quietly fixed by Treasury itself. And I don't think that I&#13;
have ever looked back or cheered every time we discovered problems. We've done it quietly,&#13;
subtly, and without causing unnecessary waves (not everybody will see it that way). I think that&#13;
the Bank therefore appreciates having a strong controller who can work effectively internally and&#13;
fix what really has to be fixed, even though he or she may be a pain in the neck once in a while,&#13;
and that is a price worth paying.&#13;
&#13;
And I feel very privileged in having Fayezul Choudhury as my successor. I think Fayez is an&#13;
excellent professional, plus the Bank needs at this juncture a different voice, bark, and bite. And&#13;
Fayez will give it to the Bank. I've seen Fayez in action with Jim Wolfensohn, and I think he has&#13;
an independent mind and he's not afraid of speaking it. Jim will probably look at him with the&#13;
same bewilderment once in a while as he looked at me. I think Jim Wolfensohn sincerely&#13;
appreciates some of the things we handled, even though he did not want to address all. For&#13;
instance, on pensions, one can go too far, and his responsibility goes over and beyond mine if the&#13;
right of life of the organization is at stake. There, one can agree to disagree.&#13;
&#13;
So, I think that the Bank has appreciated a robust definition of the function of their controller,&#13;
and I think that the support for COSO is genuine. But, there are still things to be done in terms&#13;
of clearing up all of the non-discussables. When you put your finger on it, they all have to do&#13;
with transparency, the ability for ourselves and the world we serve to look through the&#13;
organization and recognize what we really do to the world by not addressing them.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And budgeting is still an issue? As well as strategic planning?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Budgeting is still very immature, and real strategic planning is still an issue. In my&#13;
farewell note, I've coined Corporate Day the "sandbox" of an ever expanding management team.&#13;

&#13;
Here you see Jim's weaknesses in wanting to be liked. If we were to look at this ever ballooning&#13;
group ofVPs and directors, it's not really a service to the Bank nor to its future. It's the easy way&#13;
out. But at the same time, I think probably no one else would have been in the position to trail&#13;
blaze new thinking into the Bank other than Jim Wolfensohn (including things like information&#13;
systems renewal, even though I think it was implemented in a lousy way). But the very fact&#13;
remains that both in the external outreach as well as internally in the Bank we couldn't have lived&#13;
with the legacy of all the fragmented systems. You'll find reference to this in my very first note&#13;
to Richard Frank.&#13;
&#13;
I think we gave birth to SAP [computer software] by Caesarean, and it is going to be a rather&#13;
long process to heal it because you had to cut so many comers by pushing it so fast. Controllers&#13;
did not want to do it in the big bang fashion Jim wanted. Controllers was the only one that&#13;
actually has constantly flagged SAP implementation as a high risk area. You can find this in our&#13;
COSO Report from two years ago.&#13;
&#13;
That's, I think, the danger that COSO now faces, that in the longer run its predictive ability is&#13;
stronger than its remedial teeth. Then you'll really walk around in circles, and people may ask&#13;
themselves, "Are we just repeating ourselves and saying the same things?" And its effect may&#13;
slip away.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What would allow it to be sustainable?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: First of all, there is still new territory to cover. There's still a very sensitive COSO&#13;
session to be held that I never managed to get organized, which is amongst the senior&#13;
management group itself. That's because people were still licking their wounds and&#13;
remembering the first session in 1995. One ofthe first sessions I did was with senior&#13;
management in 1995 which had such abysmal results of senior Bank people not being aligned in&#13;
terms of objectives, not understanding the Bank's strategic objectives, total discormects between&#13;
groups, etcetera. This was also at the very early stage of Jim Wolfensohn's tenure with all the&#13;
changes that he brought in. It revealed we did not have a senior management but senior&#13;
managers only. And that's not a very good thing.&#13;
&#13;
I figure that we will find four or five years later the same picture. That was my prediction. And&#13;
it is not very attractive to see, especially if you've been President for five years and you still don't&#13;
have a cohesive senior management group. A lot of it has to do with the governance structure,&#13;
and then, of course, Jim's own personality, which is very one-on-one based. He has to put his&#13;
arms around your shoulders. But, I mean, you can't run this Bank the same way that you run&#13;
your own private investment bank. It's not the same, and everyone knows that. He himself has&#13;
actually been quite frank about it.&#13;
&#13;
So what makes COSO sustainable? There's still a very important senior management event to&#13;
take place. I think that we have covered the most crucial areas and people, from a controls&#13;
perspective. But having covered 1500 people out of 10,000 will not do it. There's a hunger&#13;

underneath in the organization, too. In fact, there are quite a number of people who'd like their&#13;
voice to be heard. Plus I think that the Board will keep it sustainable. Of course, the Board likes&#13;
to promote the frankness that goes with the Report, but a lot of it will depend on whether we can&#13;
maintain the same kind of frankness. Ifwe start word-smithing the Report into cliches, then I&#13;
think that COSO may ultimately peter out. But even then, I would think, in particular given the&#13;
fact that this was an unfunded mandate, it has been a very natural extension of a lot of what Jim&#13;
Wolfensohn wanted in terms of directional change in the Bank. At the same time, it has been a&#13;
natural pain in the neck for Jim when he did not want to hear, because it's been an ongoing echo&#13;
of dissatisfaction or alternative views. Again, the COSO Report predicted the calamities with&#13;
SAP. COSO labeled CRM as being totally under resourced, under skilled, and lacking in vision.&#13;
COSO harped on enterprise-wide risk management that forces one to deal with the paradoxes of&#13;
the Bank. Of course, the Executive Committee still is not there. And so Fayez may come under&#13;
pressure I've hardly ever been under. However, there are a few things such as pensions where&#13;
there had been some manageable pressure to tone it down. But I've always felt good about&#13;
putting my signature on the final text of the COSO Report.&#13;
&#13;
The good news is that there are, in terms of enabling environments, about four things that helped&#13;
me tremendously despite the occasional push-backs from the top or at peer level. The first was&#13;
that I have never felt pressures for income management. Income management means that your&#13;
peers tell you how much income should be and you make sure that it happens. That's the&#13;
challenge of any controller, one that actually lowers their life expectancy by at least half. It's a&#13;
constant conflict situation and sometimes an ethical dilemma. I was never put under such&#13;
pressure, and I am very grateful for that: a tribute to my bosses, in particular Gary Perlin. The&#13;
second was that I was blessed with excellent people in my own team as well as bosses, and I've&#13;
mentioned that before. I've just given them wings and built them some bulldozers. The third is&#13;
very important. I think my agenda, by fluke, was very complementary to what Jim Wolfensohn&#13;
wanted to achieve, except for those rare things where he didn't necessarily agree and didn't act.&#13;
So there've been a lot of things that made my life a lot easier. Fourth, my age bracket and the&#13;
fact that I got this job at a point where in my previous career I'd been through much bigger crises&#13;
with clients on different issues, and so even when I was challenged it was hard to intimidate me&#13;
because I didn't really care. And I thought through most issues very carefully before I brought&#13;
them out into a confrontational situation. Having tried all other things, I thought through all&#13;
possible scenarios. With my experience you can do that.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: How do you see the Controller function evolving in the Bank and, generally, outside of&#13;
the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: As Controller, I insisted very early on on a clear governance construct. Actually, in the&#13;
Richard Frank memo I had already argued strongly, more or less, for the job of my future boss,&#13;
which is CFO [chief financial officer]. The way I see the controller function, really, is that there&#13;
will always be a need for some reasonably independent minded professional who will ultimately&#13;
sign off on the financial statements of the Bank. Financial statements are the Bank's external and&#13;
internal representation of how it really is put together in financial terms, and that will always&#13;

&#13;
remain a core function. The degree to which he will put his finger into efficiency and&#13;
effectiveness questions for management purposes is a question of governance. I think the&#13;
Controller will also have an increasingly stronger involvement in the treasury management and&#13;
financial policies of an organization. We came from absolutely nowhere to actually having a&#13;
view, to being asked, and being a respectable and disciplined function within the Bank's&#13;
financial risk management construct as a whole. There's plenty of room left for our good&#13;
professionals in Controllers to contribute to the Bank's overall management.&#13;
&#13;
So on financial project management, the downstream part, I think if Kathy Sierra and her team&#13;
do their work, Controllers should "let go." That's an area where I think that we should now let&#13;
Operations take care of their own responsibilities. But there's still an enormous amount of work&#13;
to be done to keep everybody on their toes and to make sure that the macro picture we talked&#13;
about in terms of good governance is being worked at, including the Country Disclosure&#13;
Statement, the assurance we get from a macro perspective on the fiduciary and development&#13;
conditionalities ofthe Bank vis-a-vis its clients.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: On the controller's function in general, outside the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Outside the Bank, I think that the traditional core part of the controller function will&#13;
become a commodity. I think that the real ongoing difficulty for Controllers will be the income&#13;
management issue. The relationship between reality and real economics is becoming more and&#13;
more challenged. You used to have income management issues in the traditional economy&#13;
which were already very hard to handle because of a historic cost context. Then you look at the&#13;
E-economy at this moment and the fact that you can have a market valuation in the billions of a&#13;
company that has never made any profit. All this has also something to do with accounting and&#13;
accounting discmmects; the room to maneuver either one way or the other becomes even bigger.&#13;
&#13;
So rather than getting a narrowing of the options and possibilities, you will get a broadening of&#13;
the options and possibilities, plus the volatility of income management. And that will put the&#13;
Controllers of the future under even more pressure and will really require more spine than is&#13;
humanly possible because there will be many valid but different ways in which you can look at&#13;
income measurement of a company. And that makes it very difficult. Illegal practices you can&#13;
at least recognize and make a choice. The gray areas don't allow you a clear "No." The nature&#13;
of the micro economics of an organization is becoming such that, if you seem to have a&#13;
promising financial future, the market is going to want your balance sheet to look like absolutes,&#13;
a positive assurance statement. And there's going to be pressure to put that value on the balance&#13;
sheet. And if you put soft, intangible values on the balance sheet, you embark on slippery slopes.&#13;
Look at what happened with Micro Strategy just last year. So I think spit, spine and whatever&#13;
else you have to keep your balance is probably going to be the major attribute of a controller.&#13;
&#13;
Then, of course, his ability to work within the CFO concept in a relatively independent way,&#13;
because the CFO basically combines the bean makers, counters, and the risk takers under one&#13;
heading. And he has to deal with the trade-offs that are to be made at one point in time, while&#13;

&#13;
allowing his Controller to have an independent opinion on all this and equally call his bluff if he&#13;
has to. The higher you go up in an organization--and I'm not saying anything new--the more&#13;
paradoxes or conflicts of interest become manifest because in the end all key functions meet in&#13;
the president. He is the end bean maker, end bean counter and trader and gambler, all at the&#13;
same time.&#13;
&#13;
So being able to operate in such a new environment is going to be challenging for a Controller,&#13;
including staying ahead of the financial instruments industry game. Controllership was born out&#13;
of the accountancy profession, and I think the accountancy profession has dropped the ball in&#13;
understanding the language of finance, as finance has dropped the ball in keeping a bridge to&#13;
what is called accounting. This is a major macro risk in our world: accountants who don't&#13;
understand the language of finance can't account for its dynamics, and vice versa. And so I think&#13;
a Controller that speaks both languages is a necessity. And we have that at the Bank with Fayez&#13;
and Chuck [Charles A. McDonough) . We have some very good professionals in the Bank who&#13;
can do that.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: We've talked a good bit about James Wolfensohn. More generally, what qualities&#13;
do you think the next president of the Bank should have? One is, obviously, he should be&#13;
knowledgeable about financial markets and how rapidly they're changing, clearly. This might be&#13;
the technical side of the job. But what else would you say a president would need?&#13;
&#13;
Â·MUIS: I think the changes that Jim has pushed through, if he can bring them to maturity, from&#13;
transparency, accountability, including technology in developing countries, are very good. A&#13;
number of constituencies recognize very well the new mold and some more business thinking in&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Let me start with the "reorganization" part anew president is faced with. First, he should bring&#13;
more order in our governance construct. Secondly--but that's a value judgment that I have on&#13;
strategy--he should think very carefully and be very, very clear on how he defines "client":&#13;
whether he defines the governments as the client, whether he defines the future government as a&#13;
client, whether he defines the poor as a client, or whether he defines them all as a client and has a&#13;
formula to trade off the difference in interests. Because, for instance, at the Bank--and it's still a&#13;
non-discussable--I think there is a point that if the Bank doesn't know that its money is being&#13;
used .for purpose intended, the poor are .better off with grants than with loans.&#13;
&#13;
The new president also should have a willingness to share on strategy, not just in terms of what&#13;
he thinks is good, but also in getting the buy-in at the very top. I think our strategic musings&#13;
need orderly processes. I've dismissed them as a "sandbox." One Corporate Day and its process&#13;
is simply not enough to get a global buy-in and to do all the trade-offs which are necessary.&#13;
&#13;
I think a new president should also be financial market savvy, at least understand what it means,&#13;
because you've got the bank in the Bank and you've got the development part in the Bank, and&#13;
the bank in the Bank is really the upstream agent that makes the downstream possible, if you&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               36&#13;
&#13;
don't understand that you're handicapped as a leader.&#13;
&#13;
I think a new president should think through very carefully what "tonal setting" he wants in the&#13;
way people deal with each other. We have now, in terms of multilateral organizations, a total of&#13;
about one hundred years of serious experience, whether it is the UN or the EU or whatever else.&#13;
These organizations are being mortgaged by what anthropologists call the "politeness&#13;
conspiracy." People don't tell each other the truth. You have many different tribes, colors, and&#13;
races next to each other who have made almost a habit of avoiding rather than telling each other&#13;
the truth. You look at the IOC (International Olympic Committee) problem; you look at what&#13;
happened at the European Union last year, unthinkable that the Commission would fire itself.&#13;
The same can happen to the Bank or the IMF on different issues. So I think we should think&#13;
through very carefully how we interact with each other.&#13;
&#13;
It is almost the horizontal column of Jim Wolfensohn's CDF: how the future public institutions--&#13;
multilaterals--should be organized in order to avoid endless procrastination in getting rid of&#13;
yesterday and to see whether that can be done the way we've always done it over the last 50 or so&#13;
years, which is by internal reorganization. It is easier to build a new bank next to an old bank&#13;
than to keep building a new bank on top of an old ba:nk. In the end the latter becomes a very&#13;
fragile proposition. And so if you were to have a "thought" leader who could think in terms of&#13;
macro institutional governance and institutional sociology and would actually implement it, it&#13;
would be a real winner.&#13;
&#13;
I can easily see a system where you relinquish the old Bank and build a Bank starting anew with&#13;
a much better governance construct and with a new philosophy also in dealing with&#13;
governments: "If you don't want to be serious in us being serious, don't join us. Don't become a&#13;
shareholder." And to have a second organization that is actually a grant organization--very close&#13;
to what (Allan H .] Meltzer wants--one which goes over the heads of governments. Rather than&#13;
pumping your money into governments where you don't know where the money goes, pump it&#13;
into micro projects to the poor where you at least can create enabling environments and you can&#13;
follow the money almost better than through official channels. I think the most heartbreaking&#13;
part of the Bank is where we finance micro projects and you see how the "non-bankable" poor&#13;
actually are considerably more trustworthy in repaying their loans than the "bankable"&#13;
establishment. In many of our countries the establishments borrow in order to never pay back, to&#13;
be bailed out by either the next government or by nationalization or the mere passage of time.&#13;
&#13;
So, I would also want to have a new thinker who would actually consider a one off zero-base&#13;
budget exercise, as much as we need a new baseline conceptual thinking exercise. We need a&#13;
zero budget exercise because we've lost, I think, all feel for what is really needed in terms of&#13;
resources. For example, we don't know why we need in Bucharest 40 people and in Warsaw&#13;
another 20 or the other way around. If you've lost that sense, the only way then is to go back and&#13;
think through what we would lose if we didn't have it.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: But this is part of a larger problem, a budget problem.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: And that paper may still be reinvigorating to the planning and budget process.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: On your assessment of President Wolfensohn, what is the likelihood of him achieving&#13;
his goals, in terms of all that he has set out for himself in the development agenda?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: I think strategically he's superb but a loner. Also, I think he runs too far ahead of the&#13;
troops, so he's creating an expectation gap which could be very cruel. I think he is really sincere&#13;
and well intentioned. He's just a little na"ive, so driven by his own ideas. And, in the process, I&#13;
think the effect of some of what he does can be very cruel. Take the example of the NRS (Non&#13;
Regular Staff) exercise. You can't just take credit for regularizing half of the NRSs and not talk&#13;
about the other half that have simply been pushed out of the Banlc You can't claim that the&#13;
regular staff salaries are market driven and the NRSs were not, if the reality was that the NRSs&#13;
were market driven-and the Bank's regulars are, overall, overpaid. We have turned market&#13;
driven professionals into new mandarins. And so there is a lot of naivete underneath. I think&#13;
that when his successor comes in, I would predict that there will be a lot of, "Where were you&#13;
guys when this all happened?" Because, you can see that on Corporate Day the VPs are&#13;
considerably more frank when Jim is gone than when he's there. It looks like a whole different&#13;
meeting.&#13;
&#13;
I do think that at this juncture ofthe Bank, in the total scheme ofthings, Jim Wolfensohn has&#13;
been a fantastic blessing, certainly to me. But there is a heavy price to his dominant personality,&#13;
and that heavy price will have to be paid in the future. I would want to have as the next president&#13;
someone who would actually be willing--and that's what Jim is not willing to do--to put the&#13;
future of the Bank on the table. I mean a dramatically changed Bank. We need a president who&#13;
does ask himself the question, "After 55-60 years, since we are in the business to put ourselves&#13;
out of business, how far have we gotten, and if not, why not?" And I would be serious about that,&#13;
which is almost an echo of "Fifty Years is Enough." But I'm not saying that; I'm saying, "We're&#13;
in the business to put ourselves out of business. Have we gotten there yet?"&#13;
&#13;
l would still see for the Bank a very useful and valuable contribution if it were to go for&#13;
differential pricing and if it were to be more "thought" leadership oriented on its non-lending&#13;
roles, be it environmental, health, etcetera. I don't want to say that what I've done in accounting&#13;
is a supreme example, but I had no budget for what we've done with the external world in my&#13;
narrow field. I just put some commonsense ideas on the table, and I've leveraged change in the&#13;
accountancy profession against the background of the quality brand name of the Bank and&#13;
changed, in the meantime, that particular mini world. I think in our work on environment, health&#13;
and education we should have a few good thought leaders who could actually influence the&#13;
world in new thinking and in the implementation field by leveraging rather than implementation.&#13;
I think we should probably be involved only if asked by the client, and even then not too much. I&#13;
think we could shrink this Bank by half if we really wanted to.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: How would you look back on your tenure in the Bank in terms of the contribution you&#13;

&#13;
made, as well as what you have learned, having brought in so much expertise to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
MUIS: Oh, I learned an enormous amount! I think the nice thing I really learned was my&#13;
redefinition of a bureaucrat, because I always looked at it as somebody who ticked and checked&#13;
and harassed. But, basically, the nature of a bureaucrat is a top notch, very hard working,&#13;
excellent professional who sells his soul one time too many. That means that you can never rely&#13;
on his/her word any more in a meeting. The fact that I discovered this at the Bank doesn't mean&#13;
that you only find them at the Bank and nowhere else. You find them everywhere, in all large&#13;
organizations, public and private. Maybe it's a matter of age, but I came to the conclusion that&#13;
the moment you're not being your own man or woman anymore, that is a bureaucrat, because&#13;
you never know what he or she is thinking, in addition to having given away all his/her good&#13;
talents as a change agent. That's what I learned. I don't know if it is "from" the Bank, but at&#13;
least during the period that I stayed with the Bank. I also learned an enormous amount about&#13;
macro or micro relationships and interfacing.&#13;
&#13;
I learned a lot, even on systems renewal, and the dynamics on governance, macro governance.&#13;
Virtually every project that I undertook I looked as ifl knew what I was doing, but many times I&#13;
was just finding my way as I went along. So I think the Bank has been really the best university&#13;
of my lifetime. And I had the privilege of having basically a tenure status for five years plus.&#13;
And, you know, you learn about your own weaknesses, such that I know that I'm not very good&#13;
in diplomacy. And I do bulldoze once in a while, and in the beginning I did pull a fast one with&#13;
COSO. I mean, I knew that COSO was much more penetrating than people understood it to be&#13;
when I presented it to the Audit Committee. And I had not consulted my colleagues when doing&#13;
that. And so I had my own game plan at entry level. But I think I've played it pretty fair and&#13;
opened doors and windows since. So, I've learned a lot about how to deal with diverse and&#13;
multilateral environments and picked up a few theories of my own on how to go from politeness&#13;
conspiracies to macro accounting. It's been a fantastic time, but I'm also glad I'm gone as I think&#13;
it was really time. I was getting tired of hearing my own voice, which is always a good time to&#13;
go. And so I'll take a six months break, and next spring I'll go for another license on professional&#13;
life. And I would like to think the Bank is a better place in terms of its controls.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Well, thank you very much for a great contribution to the Bank ' s oral history program .&#13;

MUIS: Thank you.&#13;
