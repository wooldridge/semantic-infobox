'I'his is mvy first message to you since my appointment by lim Wolfenisolhn as executive vice president&#13;
of IFC and managing director of the World Bank in Jantiary of this year. Iv. decision to accept this post&#13;
reflects my deep commitmeint to the missioni of the W,Vorld Bank Group: the redtictioll of poverty in the&#13;
developing world.&#13;
More thani 3 billion people in the w,vorld live on less than two dollars a day. Almost 1.4 billion people&#13;
lack access to clean water, and 3 billion do not have access to hasic sanitation. 'lThis year far too many&#13;
children ulider fivc will die of preventable disease, and of those who live past that age, far too maniy will&#13;
work instead of going to school. 'I'he financial crisis in Asia and elsewhere has intensified tlhese problemiis&#13;
and forced more people into poverty.&#13;
While it may not be a dramatic revelation to say the world has come to acknowledge the relevance&#13;
of the private sector to economic development, the extent of this transformiiation is striking nevertheless.&#13;
It is now widely understood that private sector flows to developing countries far exceed those fiom public&#13;
sources. It is also clear, however, that the vast majority of these flows are concentrated in a relatively few&#13;
countries. A key role of the World Bank Group is to help the remainiing countries attract and benefit&#13;
from foreign direct investment.&#13;

AT A GLANCE&#13;
Equity and Quasi-Equity&#13;
IFC puts its own capital at risk by buying shares in project&#13;
companies, financial institutions, or other project entities.&#13;
These equity infusions provide enterprises in the devel-&#13;
oping world with long-term capital that does not impose&#13;
a fixed debt service schedule. Quasi-equity includes&#13;
subordinated loans and convertible debt instruments,&#13;
l                     *|      l                     which impose a fixed debt schedule, and preferred stock&#13;
* a                           ..   a a  a  a    a   and income notes, which do not impose such a schedule.&#13;
IFC may take a maximum 35 percent stake in a&#13;
venture but generally subscribes to between 5 and 15&#13;
percent of a project's equity. IFC policy is that it not be&#13;
the single largest shareholder in a project.&#13;
Equity categories are:&#13;

Loans and Intermediary Services&#13;
IFC also makes long-term loans on a project finance or a&#13;
corporate finance basis. These are called A-loans, meaning&#13;
IFC writes them for its own account.&#13;
Most IFC loans are issued in major currencies, but&#13;
IFC offers a number of local currency loans. Maturities&#13;
range between 7 and 12 years at origination but have been&#13;
extended for as long as 20 vears. Grace periods can be as&#13;
long as 4 years, depending on project needs.&#13;

agency agreement with the French financial organization&#13;
PROPARCO to develop projects for joint financing in smaller&#13;

a mutual fund investing in stock markets outside of&#13;

as the best-performing African investment fund over three&#13;

GUINEA: ALEX-SOCATRAG MAINTENANCE GARAGE&#13;
With most African mining companies verticaLLy integrated and largeLy seLf-sufficient, everything from the building of roads to the housing&#13;
of empLoyees is provided from within. To reduce costs, however, one of the largest bauxite mines in the worLd, Compagnie de Bauxite de&#13;
Guinee (CBG), recentLy decided to subcontract the operation of its vehicLe and equipment maintenance garage. IFC pLayed a key roLe in&#13;
bringing this smalL but vital project to fruition.&#13;
CBG employees, organized as a cooperative, enlisted the services of Alex Pneu Mecanique, a small Canadian company that operates&#13;
maintenance garages in Montreal. But Guinean banks were reLuctant to lend money to a cooperative and to provide term finance for&#13;
modernizing the garage. Lacking experience in Africa, Alex Pneu Mcanique Looked to IFC participation for assurance to proceed in this&#13;
innovative venture. In addition to lending $1.3 million to upgrade and expand the garage, we helped work out a corporate structure&#13;
suitable to both partners.&#13;
Since the takeover, productivity has dramaticalLy improved, with net savings to CBG and increased income for empLoyees. Operating&#13;
under the name ALex-Socatrag, the partnership has expanded beyond CBG, offering vehicle and equipment maintenance to other companies&#13;
in the region. Alex-Socatrag is but one example of how a global trend-the subcontracting of service-is extending to Africa, creating&#13;
opportunities for both Local entrepreneurs and new foreign investors.&#13;

UZBEKISTAN: GIVING SMES A BOOST&#13;
IFC's $30 million credit line for on-lending to SMEs means more jobs for Uzbekistan. The credit line, managed through three local banks,&#13;
wilt allow entrepreneurs to expand and modernize their businesses and, in the process, provide new jobs to the country's growing work&#13;
force. The need is clear: half the Uzbek population is under 25, and older workers are subject to the continuing layoffs in and closings&#13;
of Soviet-era enterprises.&#13;
One of the major constraints on SMEs in Uzbekistan has been limited access to term financing. Thus IFCs credit line will promote&#13;
technology transfer that leads to greater productivity, fosters entrepreneurship, and enhances financial management skills necessary for&#13;
the successful operation of a business in a free market economy.&#13;
An additional benefit of the project will be to advance the skills necessary in market-based banking. Through close coordination with&#13;
the World Bank, training in project finance and credit risk analysis will be offered to staff of the participating local banks. Such skills will&#13;
become the basis of Uzbek banking's capacity for undertaking financial intermediation.&#13;
begun to open their economies to private investment                -&#13;
in infrastructure. For example, IFC's FY99 approval of&#13;
financing for a power plant will support Egypt's first&#13;
independent power project.&#13;
To generate foreign exchange and create employment,&#13;
FC invested in agribusiness, tourism, pharmaceuticals,&#13;
and textiles in FY99. We supported agricultural ventures                                   3.&#13;
in Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza, the Republic of Yemen,&#13;
and Egypt, where the expansion of a dairy is expected to X&#13;
generate 1,640 new jobs. We also approved four tourism&#13;
projects in Egypt and the West Bank and Gaza, including&#13;
the Bethlehem Jacir Palace Hotel, which will be the West Bank&#13;
and Gaza's first international-standard hotel and the single             t      i&#13;
largest construction project to date in the territories. This&#13;
project complements Bethlehem 2000, a program of major&#13;
events, infrastructure renewal, and tourism development,&#13;
supported by the World Bank and major donor countries.&#13;
In Algeria, IFC arranged the country's first B-loan&#13;
syndication for a pharmaceutical project that will result&#13;
in substantial transfer of technology, foreign exchange,&#13;
and 235 jobs.&#13;
One major challenge for the Middle East and North&#13;
Africa is establishing transparent legal and regulatory&#13;
frameworks as a base for private sector development and&#13;
investment. To that end, IFC provided technical advice in              Palestinian workers on the construction site of the Bethlehem Jacir&#13;
privatization, insurance, taxation, and other essential financial      Palace Hotel the largest building project to date in the West Bank and&#13;

matters. IFC's Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS)              since 1994&#13;
conducted two projects in Egypt, helping develop both an&#13;
FDI database and a general investment promotion strategy.&#13;

CentraL  Asian Republics&#13;
Economic performance in the Central Asian republics&#13;
subregion was hit hard by the Russian and East Asian crises.&#13;
With less demand for major exports such as oil, gas, metals,&#13;
and cotton, prices fell, causing a drop in export earnings.&#13;
Currencies in all republics felt the pressure, showing significant&#13;

ture hurt private sector growth. To address this need, IFC has&#13;
provided investment capital to strengthen existing institutions&#13;

In Kazakhstan, IFC approved a loan to Bank TuranAlem&#13;
to improve its balance sheet and increase its liquidity, a sign&#13;

financial turmoil       sponsors on how to scale back the size of projects and&#13;

effects were not uniform across the region, the crisis&#13;
underscored financial sector vulnerabilities, even in&#13;
countries that had initiated strong adjustment programs&#13;
before the crisis.&#13;
Despite such distressing conditions, IFC's client&#13;

foreign investors trying to assemble financing packages.&#13;

domestic corporations lack such access, owing particularly&#13;

EL SALVADOR: AFP PREVISION PRIVATE PENSION FUND MANAGER&#13;
El SaLvador is the first country in CentraL America to repLace its state-run, "pay-as-you-go" social security system with a defined-&#13;
contribution private pension pLan. In the old pay-as-you-go arrangement, workers paid part of their wages to the government for&#13;
redistribution to retirees; as workers retired, they in turn collected the state pension. In the defined-contribution system, employers&#13;
direct a set percentage of each employee's wages to a private pension fund for retirement investment; when no Longer working, each&#13;
person controLs his own fund for support during retirement.&#13;
Experience has shown that a private pension system can improve pension provisions as weLl as encourage capital market and private&#13;
sector deveLopment. By adding to private savings, these systems can heLp finance domestic investment. The pension funds in EL Salvador&#13;
are expected, over time, to stimuLate demand for equity and long-term fixed-income instruments and add nearly $2 bilLion to the LocaL&#13;
capital market in the next 10 years.&#13;

EMERGING MARKETS DATA BASE&#13;
PROMOTING CAPITAL FLOWS THROUGH INFORMATION FLOW&#13;
Since the 1980s, IFC has provided international financial markets with reliable and comprehensive information and statistics on developing-&#13;
country stock exchanges. Using a sample of stocks in each market, the Emerging Markets Data Base calculates indexes of stock market&#13;
performance that serve as consistent benchmarks across national boundaries and eliminate variations that make locally produced indexes&#13;
difficult to compare. These indexes include the IFC Investable indexes, tracking stocks avaiLable to foreign investors, and the IFC Global&#13;
indexes, tracking the most active stocks in their respective stock markets.&#13;
During FY99, IFC expanded its coverage of equity indexes to 51 markets with the introduction of an IFC Global Index for Saudi Arabia.&#13;
The year was also notable for the first "graduation" of an IFC index market from its "emerging market" category, when Portugal was dropped&#13;
on April 1, 1999.&#13;
IFC introduced a new data feature to its product lineup, the BARRA TED consensus earnings module. The module adds brokers' one-year&#13;
and two-year consensus net profits, earnings-per-share, and dividend-per-share forecasts for many IFC Index constituent companies.&#13;
Detailed descriptions of the IFC indexes can be found at the EMDB website (www.ifc.org/emdb) in the form of special announcements&#13;
and technical notes.&#13;

OPERATIONS EVALUATION GROUP&#13;
The Operations Evaluation Group (OEG) was set up in 1995 as an independent evaluation unit to introduce systematic procedures, a&#13;
broader evaluative framework, and improved instruments for corporate accountability and learning. OEG, which maintains an arms-Length&#13;
relationship with IFC operations, reports through the World Bank's Director-General, Operations EvaLuation, to IFC's Board. IFC had been&#13;
evaluating its investnent operations since 1978 but on a less systematic basis.&#13;
In its recent analysis of IFC investments, those approved in 1991-92, OEG found that 60 to 70 percent of these mature operations&#13;
are delivering both high development impacts and profitable returns to IFC. The 60-investment stratified random sample, which repre-&#13;
sented 30 percent of all approvals in those years, also revealed that projects in high-risk countries achieved better results than those in&#13;
low-risk countries. The 60 investments garnered their highest scores for development impacts, which include the project's environmental&#13;
sustainability and contributions to the country's private sector development, economic growth, and living standards. Environmental&#13;
sustainability, for example, was rated satisfactory or excellent in 81 percent of the cases. The analysis also looked at project and company&#13;
business success, profitability of the IFC investment, and IFCs operational effectiveness.&#13;
These FY99 findings, presented in the second annual OEG review, also analyzed lessons learned and ratings patterns and made recom-&#13;
mendations to management for improved IFC performance. Under new rules promoting more openness, OEG has posted the annual review&#13;
abstract on IFC's external website [www.ifc.org/depts/html/oeg.html].&#13;

            International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            annual report 1999
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report concerns the annual review
            of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) during fiscal
            year 1999. IFC earned $249 million in net income in fiscal
            year 1999, above the $246 million earned in fiscal year 1998
            but below the record net income of $432 million achieved in
            FY97. Loan portfolio performance showed a small profit of
            $10 million in FY99. IFC's committed portfolio at the
            end of fiscal year 1999 increased by 12.8 percent to $12.9
            billion, from $11.5 billion in FY98, of which nearly 76
            percent was in loans amounting $9.8 billion and 24 percent
            was in equity investments amounting to $3.1 billion. In
            addition, IFC held and managed for participants $8.3 billion
            in loans it had syndicated. Over the next year, IFC will
            make organizational changes to clarify roles and
            responsibilities. New cross-organizational structures will
            allow IFC's transactional experience to be better
            integrated into the policy advice the World Bank provides to
            governments, while ensuring that any potential conflicts of
            interest are effectively managed. Since small and
            medium-sized enterprises represent a majority of economic
            activity in member countries, IFC will offer policy advice
            for start-ups and growth and to encourage private
            intermediaries to make needed financing available.
