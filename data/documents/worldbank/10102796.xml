            for the Water Sector&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The Small Grants Facility (SGF) for the Water Sector was established&#13;
under a tripartite agreement between the Department of Economic&#13;
Affairs, Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and the United&#13;
Nations Development Programme (UNDP). As per the Memorandum&#13;
of Understanding (MOU), the MoEF is the Executing Agency and the&#13;
UNDP-World Bank Water and Sanitation Program ­ South Asia is the&#13;
Implementing Agency. The SGF is supported by a core grant of&#13;
$300,000 from the Environment Programme under the UNDP's&#13;
Country Cooperation Framework (1997-2001) for India, and other&#13;
donors such as the Ford Foundation; the Department for International&#13;
Development (UK); Australian Aid (AUSAID); and Canadian&#13;
International Development Agency (CIDA) are also contributing to&#13;
this fund. The Dublin-Rio principles* will be the guiding principles for&#13;
the SGF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OBJECTIVES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The SGF is an instrument for supporting small-scale innovations,&#13;
action research, documentation and dissemination of lessons and best&#13;
practices or other initiatives which can catalyze larger impacts on&#13;
poverty alleviation and sustainable development in the water and&#13;
sanitation sector. The fund will focus on water resource management,&#13;
drinking water supply and environmental sanitation in India.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECTS TO BE SUPPORTED&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The SGF will support existing national/state policies as well as&#13;
encourage innovative practices that have the potential to scale up. The&#13;
fund will broadly support two types of activities:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
G    Pilot Projects&#13;
     H  that are Non-governmental Organization (NGO) and community-&#13;
        led initiatives;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
*(i) Fresh water is a finite and vulnerable resource, essential to sustain life, development&#13;
and the environment; (ii) Water development and management should be based on a&#13;
participatory approach, involving users, planners and policy makers at all levels;&#13;
(iii) Women play a central part in the provision, management and safeguarding of&#13;
water; and (iv) Water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be&#13;
recognized as an economic good.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   H that are replicable and can impact policy dialogue or trigger&#13;
     larger initiatives; and&#13;
   H that have the potential of leading to greater investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
G  Learning Products&#13;
   H that document innovative and best practices for wider&#13;
     dissemination in the sector;&#13;
   H that lead to new knowledge which could contribute to sectoral&#13;
     development; and&#13;
   H that stimulate policy debate or lead to policy reforms in the&#13;
     sector.&#13;
   Typically, projects supported by SGF should be completed within one&#13;
year. A maximum of $30,000 will be provided for each project selected&#13;
under the SGF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   SELECTION OF ORGANIZATIONS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Organizations are selected on the basis of proposals received, but&#13;
the Steering Committee reserves the right also to approach directly&#13;
reputable organizations that are result-oriented. Community-based&#13;
Organizations (CBOs), NGOs and resource institutions are encouraged&#13;
to apply. The beneficiary organization should meet the following&#13;
selection criteria:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Legal status ­ Evidence of legal registration.&#13;
   Constitution ­ Constitutional provision to engage in water&#13;
   resource, water supply and environmental sanitation service&#13;
   delivery and related activities.&#13;
   Good track record ­ Reputable organizations with a proven&#13;
   track record of at least three years' experience in water resource&#13;
   management, water supply and sanitation or community&#13;
   development activities. This should be evidenced by satisfactory&#13;
   completion of a participatory/demand-driven project.&#13;
   Finance ­ Accounts audited and certified by a chartered&#13;
   accountant.&#13;
   Staff ­ Demonstrated staffing capacity to carry out the proposed&#13;
   services or ability to procure such staffing capacity. A list of the&#13;
   members of the Board of Directors should also be submitted.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   HOW TO APPLY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   There is no formal application form for making requests for a grant&#13;
under the SGF. Please send us a concept paper outlining the purpose,&#13;
outputs and likely impacts of the project. The paper should also&#13;
describe the methodology and timetable you propose to follow, and&#13;
present a summary budget indicating the contributions sought from&#13;
the SGF, your own contributions and those from other sources. The&#13;
concept paper should not be longer than three pages and should&#13;
give the salient features of the project location and a brief&#13;
organizational profile.&#13;
   The SGF Coordinator will inform you whether your proposal can be&#13;
considered for funding and will provide you with the necessary&#13;
guidelines for preparing a detailed project proposal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   HOW DOES SGF WORK?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   A Steering Committee (SC) headed by a Joint Secretary in the MoEF&#13;
lays down the policy directives on the fund. The SC consists of&#13;
representatives of the Department of Economic Affairs, UNDP, WSP­SA,&#13;
the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission and three NGOs.&#13;
The SC has constituted a sub-committee, comprising representatives of&#13;
MoEF, UNDP, WSP­SA and other donors to the fund, to execute the&#13;
policy directives of the SC. The SGF Secretariat is managed by the&#13;
India Country Team of the WSP­SA and the SGF Coordinator is based&#13;
at WSP­SA.&#13;
   Grant applications are first screened by the SGF Coordinator.&#13;
Shortlisted organizations are then asked to prepare detailed proposals&#13;
for a review by experts in the sector. Grants are awarded by the sub-&#13;
committee based on the recommendations of expert opinion.&#13;
   Beneficiaries are required to submit quarterly reports on the&#13;
progress of the activities as well as financial accounts. If required, a&#13;
mid-term review will be undertaken to ensure quality and efficient&#13;
use of the fund. Funds will be disbursed in three stages ­ at&#13;
commencement, mid-term and on completion.&#13;
