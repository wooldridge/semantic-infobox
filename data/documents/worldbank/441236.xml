ward rather than forward, to assess market behav-    emergence of decentralized generation, the "distrib-&#13;
ior-whether prices are reflecting costs, whether          uted utility."&#13;
How investment decisions are made through least-cost planning&#13;
The traditional approach to least-cost planning starts with a forecast of demand. Forecasts take into account a range of fac-&#13;
tors-the growth of per capita incomes and populations; urbanization; the growth of industry and whether new electricity-&#13;
intensive industries are emerging; the number of people who lack electric service and would like to have it (more than 2&#13;
billion in developing countries); and improved efficiency of consumer equipment and appliances.&#13;
The next step is to define an investment program that would enable the power system to meet forecast energy and peak&#13;
power demands with a reasonable probability of avoiding brownouts and blackouts. The investment program is not confined&#13;
to new power plants, but could also include, for example, the reinforcement of transmission links with other regions that&#13;
have lower-cost supplies or spare peaking capacity (for example, if their peak demands occur at different times).&#13;
Simulation studies are then made of how the system would be operated to minimize costs; from these studies, total system&#13;
operating costs are then estimated. The capital costs of the investment program are calculated separately and added to system&#13;
operating costs to give the overall costs of the program being considered. Several alternatives and their technical feasibility&#13;
are usually examined under this approach.&#13;
Once the least-cost investments have been identified and agreed upon, bids are invited for each type of plant-for example,&#13;
for a coal-fired station of a given capacity, for a hydro plant, for so many megawatts of gas turbines for meeting peak loads,&#13;
or for a gas, diesel, or coal plant to provide the thermal complement to a hydro scheme. Consistency with efficiency in end-&#13;
use is sought through commercial pricing policies in which prices reflect the marginal costs of supply by time of day, voltage&#13;
level, and (depending on the system) season.&#13;

How risks are allowed for and who bears them will&#13;
lead to different investment decisions-for example,          Figure 1 Coal-fired power plants in the United&#13;

            are challenging the least-cost plans of power utilities
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Most of the power industry's
            engineers and planners have gained their work experience in
            vertically integrated public utilities, where investments
            are identified through least-cost planning models and bids
            are invited for precisely specified types of plant. Now,
            however, private producers are driving a new approach to
            least-cost investments in electricity supply. They are
            willing to absorb technical and financial risks--something
            that least-cost planning has never dealt with
            satisfactorily--and to find more innovative ways to reduce
            risk. Traditional approach to least-cost planning need to be
            overhauled. As private investment increases, least-cost
            planning models will become less useful for identifying the
            best investment choices. Under the new paradigm, competition
            should lead to lower-cost supplies. However, the least-cost
            models still will be useful for monitoring industry
            performance because they can help show whether investments,
            plant operating schedules, and prices are indeed being
            competitively determined.
