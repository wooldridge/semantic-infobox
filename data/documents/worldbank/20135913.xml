on the Proposed Loan (Strengthening Fiscal Management and Promoting Better and More&#13;
Inclusive Service Delivery Development Policy Loan - (Programa de Inclusdo e&#13;

The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 7 of Article V of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement of International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) hereby&#13;
submits its report pursuant to Section 4 (iii) of Article III of said Articles in respect of the&#13;
proposal that the Bank grant to the State of Bahia (the Borrower) a loan in an amount of four&#13;
hundred million Dollars ($400,000,000), which loan is to be guaranteed by the Federative&#13;
Republic of Brazil. The purpose of said loan is to support the Borrower's program aimed at&#13;
improving the Borrower's fiscal management and territorial planning, and at tailoring selected&#13;
public services to the needs of women, afro-descendants and minorities in the Borrower's&#13;
territory.&#13;
1.   The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to grant such a loan, and of&#13;
the purpose to which the proceeds of the loan are to be applied.&#13;
2.   The Committee is of the opinion that the Program toward the financing of which the&#13;
proceeds of such loan are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Bank as set forth in&#13;
Article I of said Articles of Agreement, and that said Program is designed to promote the&#13;
development of the productive facilities and resources of the Federative Republic of Brazil and is&#13;
in the interest of the Federative Republic of Brazil and of the members of the Bank as a whole.&#13;
