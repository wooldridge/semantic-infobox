        <abstracts>
            This Note briefly examines the dynamic
            interaction that can develop between pension funds and
            capital markets.  Pension funds are not only a source of
            long-term savings to support the development of bond and
            equity markets.  They can also be a positive force for
            innovation, for corporate governance, and for privatization.
            In turn, capital markets offer pension funds the opportunity
            for better portfolio returns and risk management.  This
            interaction is a long, self-reinforcing process that builds
            on sound macroeconomic policies, effective regulatory
            reforms, as well as robust accounting, legal, and
            information infrastructure.  The key message for
            policymakers is that pension reform should be part of a
            broad reform program.  It need not be delayed until capital
            markets are well established.  But, equally important, large
            quantities of state assets should not be transferred to
            newly formed private pension funds without first taking
            steps to develop robust and well-regulated capital markets.
            Chile's gradual approach to investment deregulation is
            a good model for developing countries introducing mandatory
            but decentralized pension systems.
