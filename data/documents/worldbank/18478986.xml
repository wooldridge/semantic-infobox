A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
The â&#128;&#156;Economics of Sanitation Initiativeâ&#128;&#157; (ESI) in Yunnan,        associated with sanitation, particularly in the less developed&#13;
China, is part of a study conducted by the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s          and rural parts of China such as Yunnan Province, and the&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program in East Asia. As one of the         importance of sanitation in promoting economic develop-&#13;

The most important contributor to the quantified benefits                           crucial for the success of the sanitation and hygiene pro-&#13;

Benefits of improved sanitation and hygiene can avoid the&#13;

In many municipalities and counties of Yunnan Province,                             not only the measurable economic costs and benefits,&#13;
funds are adequate to deliver more sustained and quality                            but also other key factors, including intangible impacts&#13;

Further health advancements can be achieved with im-&#13;

sanitation programs should put health among their top pri-&#13;
orities.&#13;
&#13;
Insufficient financial support for sanitation programs&#13;
threatens their sustainability and impact, and a financing&#13;
strategy is recommended to secure funds from multiple&#13;
sources.&#13;
&#13;
The many agencies involved in sanitation provision suggest&#13;
that efficiency gains be made from improved cross-sectoral&#13;
coordination and cooperation, which will lead to improved&#13;
planning and choice of technologies, strengthened mutual&#13;
learning and resource saving. It is therefore advised to cre-&#13;

Usersâ&#128;&#153; voluntary participation in sanitation and hygiene&#13;
programs is low, so people-centered implementation&#13;
approaches are advised to improve participation of us-&#13;
ers and thus increase effectiveness and sustainability of&#13;
selected options. Since most of the programs lack gender-&#13;
sensitivity, women should be encouraged to partici-&#13;
pate in decision making and implementation as well as&#13;
monitoring.&#13;

  In the recognition of sanitation as a key aspect of human                             Phase 1 of the Economics of Sanitation Initiative in 2007-&#13;

  Despite its recognized importance, sanitation continues to                            The current volume reports the second major activity of&#13;

&amp;#12;  Glossary of Terms&#13;
       Benefit-cost ratio (BCR): the ratio of the present value of the stream of benefits to the present value of the&#13;
       stream of costs. The higher the BCR is, the more efficient the intervention.&#13;
&#13;
       Cost per case averted: the discounted value of the costs for each case of a disease that is avoided because&#13;
       of an intervention.&#13;
&#13;
       Cost per DALY averted: the discounted value of the costs for each DALY that is avoided because of an&#13;
       intervention.&#13;
&#13;
       Cost per death averted: the discounted value of the costs for each death that is avoided because of an&#13;
       intervention.&#13;
&#13;
       Cost-effectiveness ratio (CER): the ratio of the present value of the future costs to the present value of&#13;
       the future health benefits in non-monetary units (cases, deaths, disability-adjusted life-years). The lower the&#13;
       CER the more efficient the intervention.&#13;
&#13;
       Disability-Adjusted Life-Year (DALY): a measurement of the gap between current health status and an&#13;
       ideal health situation where the entire population lives to an advanced age, free of disease and disability.&#13;
       One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of â&#128;&#156;healthyâ&#128;&#157; life (WHO, 2010).&#13;
&#13;
       Ecological sanitation (Ecosan): a new paradigm in sanitation that recognizes human excreta and water&#13;
       from households not as waste but as resources that can be recovered, treated where necessary and safely&#13;
       used again. It is based on the systematic implementation of reuse and recycling of nutrients and water as a&#13;
       hygienically safe, closed-loop and holistic alternative to conventional sanitation solutions (GTZ, 2009).&#13;
&#13;
       Improved sanitation: the use of the following facilities in home compounds: flush/pour-flush to piped&#13;
       sewer system/septic tank/pit latrine, ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrine, pit latrine with slab, or&#13;
       composting toilet (JMP, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
       Shared sanitation facilities: sanitation facilities of an otherwise acceptable type shared between two or&#13;
       more households. Only facilities that are not shared or not public are considered improved (JMP, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
       Open defecation: the practice of disposing human feces in fields, forests, bushes, open bodies of water,&#13;
       beaches or other open spaces or disposed of with solid waste (JMP, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
       Intangible benefits: Benefits of improved sanitation which are difficult to quantify. These include impacts&#13;
       on the quality of life, comfort, security, dignity, personal and cultural preferences, among others.&#13;
&#13;
       Internal rate of return (IRR): the discount rate for which the present value of the stream of net benefits is&#13;
       zero. In other words, the IRR is the discount rate for which the BCR equals unit (1).&#13;

                     Net benefit: the difference between the present value of the stream of benefits to the present value of the&#13;
                     stream of costs.&#13;
&#13;
                     Net present value (NPV): the discounted value of the current and future stream of net benefits from a&#13;
                     project.&#13;
&#13;
                     Payback period (PBB): represents the number of periods (e.g. years) that are necessary to recover the costs&#13;
                     incurred to that time point (investment plus recurrent costs).&#13;
&#13;
                     Unimproved sanitation: the use of the following facilities anywhere: flush/pour flush without isolation or&#13;
                     treatment, pit latrine without slab/open pit, bucket, hanging toilet/hanging latrine, use of a public facility&#13;
                     or sharing any improved facility, no facilities, bush or field (open defecation) (JMP, 2008).&#13;

       The Economics of Sanitation Initiative was conducted in Cambodia, China (Yunnan Province), Indonesia,&#13;
       Lao PDR, the Philippines and Vietnam. The study was led by the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation&#13;
       Program (WSP), with the contribution of WSP teams and consultants in each of the participating&#13;
       countries. The research team in Yunnan Province was financially and technically supported by USAIDâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
       ECO-Asia Program. The study took two years to complete, and has undergone several major peer review&#13;
       processes.&#13;
&#13;
       Guy Hutton (WSP Senior Water and Sanitation Economist and Task Team Leader) led the development&#13;
       of the concept and methodology for the ESI at regional level, the management and coordination of the&#13;
       country teams, and technical assistance. For all countries, report writing and data analysis was assisted by&#13;
       detailed tools and templates, and continual guidance on data input values, data interpretation and writing&#13;
       of reports. BjÃ&#150;rn Larsen contributed to the development of generic data collection tools and the health&#13;
       methodology. The study benefited from the continuous support of other WSP staff: Almud Weitz, Isabel&#13;
       Blackett, Yosa Yuliarsa, Irvan Tjondronegoro and WSP support staff.&#13;
&#13;
       In Yunnan Province, ESI has been supported by the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) of&#13;
       Yunnan Province. Zhou Bo led project preparation and coordination of field studies. Liang Chuan,&#13;
       associate professor at Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences, led and managed the research team, supervised&#13;
       data collection, data analysis and report writing, and played a major role in writing the study report.&#13;
       The research team was composed of multi-disciplinary researchers: Fang Jinmin (program approach&#13;
       analysis and health data collection); Dong Di and Dong Lin (cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis);&#13;
       Luo Ronghuai (focus group discussions); associate researchers Zhang Tiwei, Zou Yahui and Wang Jing&#13;
       (subgroup leaders of field survey and data set management); Zhouzheng Yuxiao (team member); and Yang&#13;
       Liqiong and Zhang Pu from YEPD (management of water quality survey, the external environment survey&#13;
       and policy issues).&#13;
&#13;
       The research team also appreciates the assistance of doctors and health researchers from the Associated&#13;
       Hospital of Yunnan University in providing health data. Special thanks are also given to the graduate&#13;
       students from Southwest Forestry College, Yunnan Normal University and Yunnan Ethnological&#13;
       University, who worked hard in the field to conduct the household survey.&#13;
&#13;
       The contribution of peer reviews of the Yunnan report is gratefully acknowledged. Paul Kriss (World Bank,&#13;
       Beijing) and Linda Shi (ECO-Asia) provided valuable comments. Peer reviewers of other country reports&#13;
       also fed into the final version of this report, whose contribution is acknowledged in the specific country&#13;
       report they contributed to.&#13;
&#13;
       It is also acknowledged that many governmental agencies and institutes including Yunnan Provincial&#13;
       Development and Reform Committee, Rural Energy Station, Yunnan Provincial Health and Disease&#13;
       Control Center, Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Federation, Urban Construction Bureau of Kunming Municipal City, Yunnan&#13;
       Provincial Forestry Department, and the Poverty Alleviation Office of Yunnan Provincial Government have&#13;
       all provided peer reviews to validate the research results and policy recommendations. Special thanks are&#13;
       given to those local community organizations and local agencies which supported the field surveys.&#13;

five countries of Southeast Asia found that poor sanitation                        to 2007 conducted by the National Patriotic Health Cam-&#13;
causes considerable financial and economic losses. Financial                       paign Committee, the Ministry of Health, revealed that&#13;
losses â&#128;&#147; including direct monetary costs â&#128;&#147; average 0.44%                           84% of households use excreta in agricultural production,&#13;

 The major concern in economic evaluation is to understand                           competitive compared with other uses of the same health&#13;
 economic and/or financial efficiency â&#128;&#147; in terms of return on                        budget.&#13;
 investment and recurrent expenditure. Hence the focus of&#13;
 economic evaluation is on what it costs to deliver an inter-                        As well as overall efficiency questions, it is useful from deci-&#13;
 vention and what the returns are. Several different efficiency                      sion making, planning and advocacy perspectives to better&#13;
 measures allow examination of the question from different                           understand the nature and timing of costs and benefits, as&#13;
 angles, such as number of times by which benefits exceed                            well as how non-economic aspects (such as socio-cultural&#13;
 costs, the annual equivalent returns, and the time to repay                         considerations) affect the implementation of sanitation in-&#13;
 costs and start generating net benefits (see Box 1). Also,                          terventions (see boxes 2 and 3). Furthermore, given that&#13;
 as sanitation and hygiene improvement also fall within the                          several impacts of improved sanitation cannot easily be&#13;

&#13;
     BOX 1. RESEARCH QUESTIONS ON SANITATION EFFICIENCY&#13;
      i.	 Are benefits greater than the costs of sanitation interventions? By what proportion do benefits exceed&#13;
          costs (benefit-cost ratio â&#128;&#147; BCR)?&#13;
      ii.	 What is the annual internal rate of return (IRR)? How does the IRR compare to national or international&#13;
           standards for investments of public and private funds? How does the IRR compare to other non-&#13;
           sanitation development interventions?&#13;
      iii.	 How long does it take for a household to recover its initial investment costs, at different levels of cost&#13;
            sharing (payback period â&#128;&#147; PBP)?&#13;
      iv.	 What is the net gain of each sanitation intervention (net present value â&#128;&#147; NPV)? What is the potential&#13;
           interest of sanitation for business opportunities ?&#13;
      v.	 What is the cost of achieving standard health gains such as averted death, cases and disability-adjusted&#13;
          life-year (DALY)?&#13;
      vi.	How does economic performance vary across sanitation options, program approaches, locations, and&#13;
          countries? What factors explain performance?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOX 2. RESEARCH QUESTIONS ON SANITATION COSTS&#13;
      i.	 What is the range of costs for each technology option in different field settings? What factors determine&#13;
          cost levels (e.g. quality, duration of hardware and software services)?&#13;
      ii.	 What proportion of costs are capital, program and recurrent costs, for different interventions? What are&#13;
           necessary maintenance and repair interventions, and costs, to extend the life of hardware and increase&#13;
           sustainability?&#13;
      iii.	 What proportion of total (economic) cost is financial in nature? How are financial and economic costs&#13;
            financed in each field location?&#13;
      iv.	 What are the incremental costs of moving from one sanitation improvement to another - i.e. up the&#13;
           sanitation ladder â&#128;&#147; for specified populations to meet sanitation targets?&#13;

tion costs and benefits. Most importantly, the full benefits                         Given that scale-up cannot be achieved with full subsidi-&#13;
of a sanitation intervention may not be received due to                              zation of sanitation interventions by government or other&#13;
implementation issues that affect the uptake and compli-                             sector partners, it will be key to better understanding how&#13;

&#13;
   BOX 3. RESEARCH QUESTIONS ON SANITATION BENEFITS&#13;
     i.	 What local evidence exists for the links between sanitation and the following impacts: health impact,&#13;
         water quality and water users, land use, time use, and welfare?&#13;
     ii.	 What are the size of financial and economic benefits related to health expenditure, health-related&#13;
          productivity and premature mortality; household water uses; time savings; property value; and other&#13;
          welfare impacts?&#13;
     iii.	 What proportion of the benefits are pecuniary benefits (financial gains) and what proportion are non-&#13;
           pecuniary benefits?&#13;
     iv.	 What proportion of each benefit accrues to households who invest in sanitation and what proportion is&#13;
          external to the household?&#13;
     v.	 What is the actual or likely willingness to pay of households and other agencies for improved sanitation?&#13;
     vi.	How do benefits accrue or vary over time?&#13;
     vii.	How is improved sanitation â&#128;&#147; and the related costs and benefits â&#128;&#147; tangibly linked with poverty reduction?&#13;
     viii.	What is the overall household and community demand (expressed and latent demand) for improved&#13;
          sanitation?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   BOX 4. OTHER RESEARCH QUESTIONS&#13;
     i.	 How do program design and program implementation affect costs and benefits? In practice, (how) can&#13;
         sanitation programs be delivered more efficiently â&#128;&#147; i.e. reducing costs without reducing benefits?&#13;
     ii.	 How to leverage grants to incentivize investments in sanitation?&#13;
     iii.	 What factors determine program performance? What are the key factors of success and constraint,&#13;
           covering contextual, institutional, financial, social and technical aspects?&#13;
     iv.	 Which program approaches are best suited to which technical options?&#13;
     v.	 What is the acceptability of different sanitation options and program approaches?&#13;
     vi.	What other issues determine intervention choice and program design in relation to local constraints:&#13;
         energy use, water use, polluting substance discharge, and option robustness/durability/maintenance&#13;
         requirements?&#13;

   The VOSL of US$2 million is transferred to the study countries by adjusting downwards by the ratio of GDP per capita in each country to GDP per&#13;
 capita in the USA. The calculation is made using official exchange rates, assuming an income elasticity of 1.0. Direct exchange from higher to lower income&#13;
 countries implies an income elasticity assumption of 1.0, which may not be true in practice.&#13;

    VOSL studies attempt to value what individuals are willing to pay to reduce the risk of death (e.g. safety measures) or willing to accept for an increase in the risk of&#13;
 death. These values are extracted either from observations of actual market and individual behavior (â&#128;&#156;hedonic pricingâ&#128;&#157;) or from what individuals stated in relation to&#13;
 their preferences from interviews or written tests (â&#128;&#156;contingent valuationâ&#128;&#157;). Both these approaches estimate directly the willingness to pay of individuals, or society, for a&#13;
 reduction in the risk of death, and hence are more closely associated with actual welfare loss compared with the HCA.&#13;

improving sanitation on two sets of mitigation measures:                            calculates the time savings for different population groups&#13;
                                                                                    of improving sanitation, based on observations of house-&#13;

       piped water, it would in theory reduce these costs if&#13;
       sanitation was improved. For example, traditionally                          Excreta reuse: Human excreta, if handled properly, can be&#13;
       people prefer the taste of water from shallow wells to                       a safe source of fertilizer, wastewater for irrigation or aqua-&#13;
       deeper wells, and hence would likely return to the                           culture, or biogas. In four of the eight sites (three rural and&#13;
       use of shallow wells if they could guarantee cleaner,                        one peri-urban), UDDTs have been provided, and biogas&#13;

       treat water less if it is less contaminated, thus saving                     excreta reuse is measured through the assessment of the&#13;
       costs. Hence, expected percentage cost reductions                            nonmarket value (when used by the household, given that&#13;
       are applied to current costs of clean water access to                        the by-products are rarely sold or traded in the field sites).&#13;
       estimate cost savings from improved sanitation.                              This enables calculation of an average value per household&#13;

       ly true even for piped, treated water supplies. Boiling&#13;
       is the most popular method because it is perceived to                        Intangibles: Intangibles are major determinants of per-&#13;

       for making tea. However, boiling water can require                           convenience, safety, status and prestige. Due to their often&#13;
       considerable cash outlays or it consumes their time                          very private nature, intangibles are difficult to elicit reliable&#13;
       for collecting fuel. Furthermore, boiling water for                          responses from individuals, and some may vary consider-&#13;
       drinking purposes is more costly to the environment                          ably from one individual and social group to another. In-&#13;
       due to the use of wood, charcoal or electricity, with                        tangibles are therefore difficult to quantify and summarize&#13;

 To increase drinking water safety, sanitation improvement                            of three sites, the lowest percentage of not-isolated-sani-&#13;

 must be taken into account. Upgrading the physical struc-                            the improved latrine, in this case, water flush toilets, can&#13;
 ture alone will not help, unless human waste is treated and                          cause serious pollution to the water body if the waste is&#13;
 safely disposed of.                                                                  not properly disposed of.&#13;

 Not-isolated or partially isolated human excreta and                                 The field survey results suggest that the majority (67.4%)&#13;

Table 17 shows that water access cost is roughly US$80 per                           there. However, in Qiubei, most men and women choose&#13;
household per year. Although in most rural villages water                            their â&#128;&#156;neighborâ&#128;&#153;s plotâ&#128;&#157; or an â&#128;&#156;outside plotâ&#128;&#157;, showing shared&#13;
fees do not fully recover provision costs, as in most cases,                         toilets and public toilets are relatively popular there.&#13;
customers do need to contribute to the construction and&#13;
maintenance of the waterworks. In cities, where the cost of                          In rural areas, most peasants from Luquan, Kunming&#13;
a centralized water supply is shared by a large population,                          choose to use their â&#128;&#156;own plotâ&#128;&#157;, with average value close to&#13;
the average cost per capita is lower than that in villages. Un-                      90%, while peasants (male and female adults ) from Dali&#13;
like the water source access cost, water treatment cost varies                       and Qiubei prefer to use their â&#128;&#156;own plotâ&#128;&#157;, with an average&#13;

&#13;
Households with unsecured drinking water sources tend                                Over 70% of male and female adults on the urban-rural&#13;
to buy bottled water, if it is available and affordable, or in                       fringe choose to use an â&#128;&#156;outside plotâ&#128;&#157;, while the rest use&#13;
most cases treat water at home by boiling, settling and de-                          their â&#128;&#156;own plotâ&#128;&#157;. Almost every child has made the same&#13;
composition and other means. Boiling is the most prevalent                           option with some tiny differences. One-hundred percent&#13;
home treatment method, with an average cost of US$27 to                              of rural children in Jinning (site PU1) choose to use an&#13;

fact that the Chinese tradition of boiling water to make hot                         For the households with no own toilet, it is normal to make&#13;

      BOX 1. CASE STUDIES OF HOUSEHOLDS WITH NO TOILETS&#13;
      Dali Old Town: Lack of adequate land space for sanitation options&#13;
      Dali Old Town, with its Bai ethnic population and unique architecture and culture, is a famous tourism attraction. It has&#13;
      been rebuilt on the site of the previous old town with a municipal sewerage system connected to a wastewater treat-&#13;
      ment plant. But there are some residents using public toilets due to a lack of private sanitation options.&#13;
      A lack of a proper land area to build private toilets is one of the main reasons that some households living in old com-&#13;
      munities of Dali Old Town do not have private toilets. If a household wants to build a toilet, he or she first has to build a&#13;
      private septic tank to connect to the municipal sewerage system. Therefore, the cost is very high. On the other hand,&#13;
      to protect the architectural style in the old town, private construction permits are strictly controlled.&#13;
      Xiangshui Miao ethnic village: Sanitation in a poor, disadvantaged, and difficult to access village&#13;
      Xiangshui Miao ethnic village, located in Qiubei County, is difficult to access from the town center. As of 2008, the vil-&#13;
      lage had 75 households, with an estimated 400 people. The village is poverty-stricken with poor physical infrastructure&#13;
      and living conditions. The average annual net income per capita of the village is less than RMB500.&#13;
      For drinking water and domestic use water, the villagers have to fetch water from the hill gully by oxcarts or manual la-&#13;
      bor. There are only two shared pit latrines in the village constructed by the school and by a relatively wealthy household.&#13;
      It is the poverty and the lack of development opportunities that are the main reasons for not having toilets.&#13;
      The radical behavior changes required by UDDT results in low acceptance&#13;
      The village of Huichangcun, located on the banks of Dianchi Lake within Jingning County territory, has built UDDTs&#13;
      with government subsidies, but only around 20% were actually used. The reasons for the low acceptance of UDDT&#13;
      are mainly because of their poor quality and the need for dramatic change in the living habits. In addition, the project&#13;
      performance â&#128;&#148; such as lack of sufficient promotion of usersâ&#128;&#153; awareness on the new sanitation options and their func-&#13;
      tions â&#128;&#148; is also a main factor in affecting usersâ&#128;&#153; acceptance.&#13;

owners of apartments could choose different kinds of sani-                           construction, resistance to changing habits related to toi-&#13;
tation furnishings and options according to their prefer-                            let-going and the required maintenance of new sanitation&#13;
ences and the affordability of the sanitation options.                               options. The two cases in Box 1 serve as examples of why&#13;
                                                                                     households lack private sanitation options.&#13;
Across the peri-urban and rural sites, the households mostly&#13;
use traditional pit latrines and shared pit latrines that are                        Also, the FGDs revealed that some male villagers have poor&#13;
built outdoors and in communal places. In addition, 3-in-1                           awareness of the importance of toilets and sanitation. The&#13;
biogas units and UDDT are also used widely due to the pro-                           men claimed it is convenient to defecate in the open, be-&#13;
motion of governmental projects and other donors. A lack                             cause they do not need a fixed location and they feel unre-&#13;
of a public sewerage system is the main constraint for the                           stricted. What they need is a relatively concealed place. Fur-&#13;
peri-urban and rural population in choosing flush toilets.                           thermore, they do not have to clean the place up. Therefore,&#13;
                                                                                     cropland, bushes, the place beside a ditch and even spaces&#13;
The main reasons why some households lack toilets include                            in front of and in back of a house are used for urinating or&#13;
a lack of investment capital, a lack of a proper land site for                       defecating.&#13;

The â&#128;&#156;externalâ&#128;&#157; environment refers to the area outside the                            and there are several regulations forbidding some activities&#13;

The survey findings indicate that environmental sanita-                              areas with an average score of 4.1. The overall community&#13;
tion is worse in rural areas than in urban areas, especially in                      living areas rank as moderately soiled. There is little dif-&#13;
Kunming-Luquan and Qiubei counties. This occurs for two                              ference in the scores among urban, peri-urban and rural&#13;
reasons: first, the procedures for human excreta reuse do not                        areas. Figure 32 and Figure 33 show the quality of envi-&#13;

sion of the local stockbreeding, the management of animal                            living areas, ranked by interviewees in the household&#13;
excreta remains unsanitary. For example, Luquan County                               survey.&#13;

The children in the town often suffer from bacterial diarrhea                        ence of human and animal excrement, domestic garbage and&#13;

other problems co-exist in the town, which are the sources                           are willing to pay for better public waste management.&#13;

in the rainy season is caused by discharged waste in streams                         Scores provided by villagers from rural areas on the envi-&#13;

make water quality poor. Sanitation behavior in private and                          ternal environments of most villages are very bad, due to&#13;
public locations is also the main factor in causing disease                          lack of management of domestic waste and animal excre-&#13;

Table 33 shows the main characteristics of different sani-                            In urban areas, communal systems are a necessity, especially&#13;
tation programs in eight sites. Program approaches are                                in densely populated areas or apartments. When houses in&#13;
assessed from three perspectives: the implementation ap-                              urban areas are constructed, the sanitation system is de-&#13;
proach, the financing approach and the partnership ap-                                signed and constructed by a property developer. The house-&#13;
proach, as follows.                                                                   hold commonly chooses the sanitation facilities, such as&#13;
                                                                                      specific toilet hardware. However, it is not the householdâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
6.1.2 IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH                                                         choice whether it is connected to the sewerage system or&#13;
In rural areas, there are two main motivators for improve-                            not. In urban areas, the household covers the water bills and&#13;
ments in sanitation. One is household self-motivation,                                maintenance fee. The government will fund the wastewater&#13;
where (usually) the pit latrine is voluntarily constructed                            treatment systems and other management costs. It could&#13;
by the household. In this sense it is autonomous and de-                              be said that this approach is partially demand-led from the&#13;
mand-led. The technology is simple, and the human ex-                                 household, as they demand more hygienic and comfortable&#13;
creta is commonly reused in the fields. The other motivator                           sanitation facilities, including water flushing systems.&#13;
for improved sanitation is supply-driven (project-driven).&#13;
Under this implementation approach, the funds are com-                                Figure 44 shows the proportion of households with choice&#13;
monly available, either from government subsidies or from                             to participate. In general, the rate of households who feel&#13;

ment, the implementation approach is usually â&#128;&#156;top-down,â&#128;&#157;                              very high. The highest voluntary participation rate is from&#13;
in that limited consideration is taken of the local needs and                         Dali peri-urban areas, with a 30% voluntary participation&#13;
conditions. The toilet type is chosen for households, but                             rate; the lowest is from Qiubei City areas, with less than a&#13;
the households accept the project because it is almost free                           10% voluntary participation rate. This may be related to&#13;
for them. If they are not active in the project, other projects                       the top-down planning approach of government projects.&#13;
may not be extended to their communities. Therefore, the                              Only a small part of the projects used participatory meth-&#13;
actual use of the sanitation option may not be high, and                              ods to understand customersâ&#128;&#153; needs and opinions. In addi-&#13;
hence the efficiency is affected. For example, there exist in-                        tion, shown in Annex Table H1, in most projects there are&#13;
stances where the biogas toilet is constructed in households                          no other complementary activities. Only a small number of&#13;
that do not raise any animals or where the climate is not                             projects conducted supporting activities, such as carrying&#13;
very suitable for year-round biogas generation. Project-driv-                         out health awareness education or provision of water. This&#13;
en sanitation requires better project design and post-project                         may be related to the narrow scope of project design and&#13;
management.                                                                           limited project funding.&#13;

for pit latrines among the three rural sites, shown in Figure                                              12&#13;

8.3	 INTEGRATING ECONOMIC&#13;
      CONSIDERATIONS INTO A DECISION&#13;
      MAKING PROCESS&#13;
Currently in Yunnan or even China, sanitation planning&#13;
largely relies on qualitative arguments. Limited economic&#13;
aspects are considered, except for large sanitation infra-&#13;
structure (sewage system and treatment plants, centralized&#13;
human waste disposal sites) and in the context of develop-&#13;
ment loans from external agencies and banks. Economic&#13;
evidence from this study can now be used to strengthen the&#13;
feasibility and planning phases of future sanitation projects.&#13;
However, it might require more solid and robust studies&#13;
to be carried out in the specific context of the projects to&#13;
justify the decisions made. Similar studies need to be con-&#13;
ducted in other provinces of China.&#13;

 As indicated in Chapter 1, the sanitation system in China                          Based on the results presented in this study, more specific&#13;
 is highly complex, due to the multiple and multi-sector                            studies would help in verifying, supporting or extending&#13;
 stakeholders involved, different program orientations, va-                         the messages, especially the economic valuation of the ben-&#13;
 riety of funding sources and mechanisms, and the very dis-                         efits of improved sanitation. The following topics are sug-&#13;
 tinct sanitation situations by region and localities. During                       gested for follow-up in the near future: 1) valuation of envi-&#13;
 the program approach analysis, the team identified several                         ronmental impacts of unimproved sanitation; 2) valuation&#13;
 weaknesses in the current data system caused by the sys-                           of intangible benefits of improved sanitation; 3) program&#13;
 temâ&#128;&#153;s complexity. First, different data sources present very                       costs of governmental and non-governmental sanitation&#13;
 different figures for the coverage of sanitary latrines in rural                   programs; and 4) market-based private sector involvement&#13;
 areas. Second, in the past, systematic surveys of sanitary la-                     and demand oriented approaches.&#13;
 trine coverage focused on rural areas, resulting in a lack of&#13;
 data on sanitation coverage in urban areas. This, in turn,                         Recommendation 10. Promote evidence-based sanita-&#13;
 translates into a lack of combined urban and rural statistical                     tion decision making.&#13;
 data. Third, program cost is often missing in governmental&#13;
 budget plans as governmental programs mainly focus on                              Variations in economic performance of options suggest a&#13;
 physical infrastructure. Therefore the actual cost is under-                       careful consideration of site conditions is needed to select&#13;
 estimated and the budgeting requirement for software cost                          the most appropriate sanitation option and delivery ap-&#13;
 in programs is not appreciated by either decision makers or                        proach. Decisions should take into account not only the&#13;
 implementers.                                                                      measurable economic costs and benefits, but also other key&#13;
                                                                                    factors for a decision, including intangible impacts and&#13;
 As the primary goal of all hygiene and sanitation projects                         socio-cultural issues that influence demand and behavior&#13;
 is to improve public health and social well-being, all sec-                        change, availability of suppliers and private financing, and&#13;

 mental, socio-economic and technical indicators, in addi-&#13;
 tion to project-specific indicators. These indicators should&#13;
 capture the multiple benefits of environmental health and&#13;
 sanitation facilities, including health gains, renewable en-&#13;
 ergy development, avoided water pollution, quality of life&#13;
 improvement (especially for women), and the opportunity&#13;
 cost of time (productive uses). Future efforts should build&#13;
 on the databases and experiences from the ESI study.&#13;
&#13;
 This report recommends that the Patriotic Health Cam-&#13;
 paign Committee (PHCC) coordinate with other depart-&#13;
 ments and come to an agreement on a revised database to&#13;
 address the abovementioned problems. Regular exchanges&#13;
 and information sharing among relevant sectoral depart-&#13;
 ments should be institutionalized for better coordination.&#13;
 PHCC should make data and information available to the&#13;
 public as well, for instance, via information bulletins up-&#13;
 loaded to their website.&#13;

            Economic assessment of sanitation
            interventions in Yunnan Province, People&#146;s Republic of China
            : a six-country study conducted in Cambodia, China,
            Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines and Vietnam under the
            Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI)
        </repnme>

            This study evaluates the costs and
            benefits of technical sanitation options and programs in
            Yunnan Province, China, as part of the Economics of
            Sanitation Initiative (ESI) conducted by the World
            Bank's Water and Sanitation Program in East Asia. As an
            underdeveloped province, Yunnan has achieved huge progress
            in sanitation improvement since the 1990s. Sanitation
            options evaluated in the study include the facilities to
            collect and convey human excreta, household wastewater
            treatment, and related hygiene practices. The benefits of
            sanitation evaluated include health, water quality, time to
            access sanitation facilities, external environment, reuse of
            human excreta, quality of life improvement, and other
            intangible benefits such as privacy, cleanliness and
            comfort. The costs of sanitation measured include investment
            costs and recurrent costs (operations and maintenance). The
            study compares the costs and benefits of alternative
            improved sanitation options over the expected life of each
            technology, to estimate efficiency of alternative sanitation
            options. For the study sanitation options in eight different
            sites throughout Yunnan Province were selected. Three rural
            sites include: a) villages in Luquan county&#146;s mountainous
            rural villages (R1); b) Dali Shangguan (R2) lakeside plain;
            and c) villages in Qiubei county (R3). Three urban sites
            represent: a) Kunming (U1); b) Dali (U2); and c) Qiubei
            (U3). Two peri-urban sites include: a) Kunyang town of
            Jinning County (PU1) and b) Dali Zhoucheng (PU2). The
            economic returns on all improved sanitation options are
            significant in all the sites evaluated, when compared with
            no access to basic sanitation.
