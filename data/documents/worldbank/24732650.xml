ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
This Collaboration Arrangement is er tered into on  , 2015 between:&#13;
(1)   MIZUHO BANK, LTD, headquartered at Otemachi Tower, 1-5-5, Otemachi, Chiyoda-ku, ki o&#13;
100-8176, Japan, ("Mizuho"; and&#13;
(2)   THE WORLD BANK GROUP, comprising the INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION AND E EVELOPMENT ("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPI I T&#13;
ASSOCIATION ("IDA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, U  the&#13;
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION, ("IFC") headquartered at 2121 Pennsylva ii1&#13;
Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20433, USA, and the MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT&#13;
GUARANTEE AGENCY, ("IIGA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, D''&#13;
20433, USA (the "World Baiik Group")&#13;
(each a "Party" and together the "Parties").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad international recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Inteil n: nal&#13;
Organizations (1Os), the G71, and the private sector represented by the B20 that investir c i; the&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed, to E x1 and&#13;
access to basic services and raise living standards for all, and to meet global economit ;Ii wth&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need presents a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on existing 3:i. ces&#13;
of infrastructure finance-paticularly in the public sector-a redoubled and coordinated Eil: rt is&#13;
needed to mobilize private sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of robuist pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects an : t s is&#13;
understood to be the greatest barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investrr: r&#13;
(D) Governments, development inance institutions, donors, and private investors share an in:E n" St in&#13;
developing the market for pri,fate infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand sic i i the&#13;
numbers of structurally soun J and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual emer( E n e of&#13;
EMDE infrastructure as a rE cognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range o :r /ate&#13;
investors that actively particir ate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals will ben it rom&#13;
collective action between this range of entities-to leverage resources and knowledgE :c find&#13;
solutions to complex infrastructure financing challenges that no single institution could a:: eve&#13;
alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, thE Parties propose the establishment of a Global InfrastructurE :I :ility&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF") The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at levera :i the&#13;
efforts of the wide range of i istitutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastruci J E Nith&#13;
the participation of private infrastructure investors, coalescing around project prel &amp;i ion,&#13;
structuring, and risk mitigatio i for individual infrastructure investments. In this regard, the (,I:  lims&#13;
to complement existing and proposed services and initiatives currently supported by thE  ties&#13;
and other prospective GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prepe  lell-&#13;
structured, infrastructure prcjects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for acces,ii: the&#13;
expertise of the Parties and other GIF partners, in combination with guidance from pro 'lIE tive&#13;
private sector financiers into project structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater Io ' age&#13;
of official resources in the face of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particular :) I irge&#13;
and complex projects with th- potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;
(F) The Parties are now interested in collaborating in developing the Global Infrastructure 1 :ility&#13;
Partnership Program, together with other partners.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
Accordingly, the Parties have come to the following understanding:&#13;
1     Global Infrastructure Facility Partnership Program Framework&#13;
1.1   The GIF is intended :o be based on the preliminary objectives and principles set cIA&#13;
Annex 1 (Preliminary GIF Fovndational Principles). The Parties acknowledge their mutual&#13;
understanding that while the GIF Foundational Principles are an initial basis for their&#13;
collaboration, they are of an ndicative nature and will continue to be developed amongst -:&#13;
Parties and with other potential partners until the GIF is formally established. The final ver :, of&#13;
these objectives and principl,s will be agreed upon by the GIF Partners and be reflected i I thI&#13;
agreement establishing the GIF.&#13;
1.2   The Parties intend tc work together with any additional participants who may be&#13;
collaborating on the GIF to ft rther enhance their coordination, in particular by developing i . 31F,&#13;
with a view to formally establ shing the program by June 2015.&#13;
2     Further Collaboration&#13;
2.1   Pursuant to the forec oing, the Parties will use reasonable endeavors to continue 1:&gt;&#13;
collaborate in developing the GIF, including but not limited to:&#13;
a. Nature and scope of collaboration under the GIF, such as proposed categories of&#13;
partnership and the ioles, rights, and responsibilities associated with each catego&#13;
b. Governance arrangements of the GIF;&#13;
c. Operational policies 3pplicable to the GIF's operations;&#13;
d. Scope of GIF activitiIs and sources/uses of GIF funds, including approach to proj :.t&#13;

e. Any other aspects of collaboration required to finalize the design of the GIF, inclu in(I&#13;
sharing best practice and experience with regard to project preparation, through tl E Ie&#13;
of knowledge platforms for the infrastructure sector.&#13;
2.2   During the process of finaliz ng the design of the GIF, the multilateral development banks i ;i d in&#13;
Annex 2 will be invited to participate as initial Technical Partners. Once the GIF design is f i 'ed,&#13;
additional collaborative effoIs are required to develop the operational details for the G F: t all&#13;
times complementing existing efforts and facilities and building upon the shared knowle 1(0 and&#13;
experience of the Parties in :his area. This includes determining the level of coordination I E l: een&#13;
the Parties and project origi iation process.&#13;

Annex 1&#13;
Preli-ninary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the GIF is to promote private sector investment in infrastructure Ir:) cts&#13;
in emerging markets and de teloping economies (EMDEs) through robust project prepara or&#13;
provision of appropriate risk mitigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commerci I 2 d&#13;
institutional investor engage nent in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex put lic-private partnerships and projects with potential for commE 1:i&#13;
viability which require projec: preparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastr it -e&#13;
financing solutions that no single institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF aims to create a global platform to provide financial and coor Ji n tion&#13;
resources in collaboration w th the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of t 1E ide&#13;
range of donor and development finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EM[PF&#13;
infrastructure, with the input and ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engagem( rI :)uld&#13;
stretch from upstream suppc rt on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibilit&#13;
assessment, through to dowistream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and ris:&#13;
mitigation/credit enhanceme it.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer tern, by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structur :I&#13;
infrastructure projects, the GIF can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset clE ss attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking Ion -:E m&#13;
assets in faster growing eco iomies, but which until now have been presented only limitec&#13;
infrastructure investment opportunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profil&#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to c perate according to the following core principles, to be finaliz ):l pon&#13;
agreement among GIF partrers:&#13;
(i) Leveraging the private sector-specializing in project financing modalities 1 -11 vill&#13;
draw together comparative advantages of public and private sectors;&#13;
(ii) Addressing pulic goods-focusing on core infrastructure; particularly thos:&#13;
infrastructure projects that are climate friendly or trade enabling;&#13;
(iii) Promoting susl ainability and inclusiveness-ensuring projects adhere to :)&#13;
practice standarJs for social and environmental responsibility; and&#13;
(iv) Collaborating, complementing and partnering for solutions-mobilizing t   :h lical&#13;
and financial resources of all partner entities-World Bank Group entities, mL It o eral&#13;
development institutions, other public institutions, and private investors-in a&#13;
innovative and f exible way, to complement existing capacities, achieve great n&#13;
leverage and address the complex infrastructure financing challenges that ar!&#13;
beyond the resources of any individual partner.&#13;
3     Institutional Arrangements and Governance&#13;
3.1   The GIF is expected to involve a wide range of stakeholders who are involved in h:?&#13;
development and implementation of infrastructure projects, both public and private. GIF p I'Tr 3rs&#13;
are expected to fall into one or more of the following categories:&#13;
7&#13;

(i) Funding Partners-Partners that provide financial contributions to the GIF v,i I a&#13;
considered Fun ding Partners.&#13;
(ii) Technical Partiers-Partners that can and who will agree to provide specifi::&#13;
technical advice and support to GIF activities including execution of GIF-func : :I&#13;
activities and/or provision of GIF-backed credit enhancement or liquidity supf Crt&#13;
instruments.&#13;
(iii) Advisory Partners-Private investors or entities that represent the voice of&#13;
commercial and'or institutional investment, whether pension funds, insurancE&#13;
companies, sov ?reign wealth funds, banks or other financial institutions, as v 'll s&#13;

infrastructure pr )jects, to be invited into discussions related to project prepar it ,&#13;
optimal approacies to financial structuring, and the design and use of risk&#13;
instruments, wit ) a view to ensure suitability of projects for commercial and/o&#13;
institutional investment.&#13;
3.2   A GIF Governing Council is proposed to oversee the GIF's strategic programmii(&#13;
management and use of fun is, and development of operational policies and procedures; a1i1:&#13;
hold the GIF Management Lnit (see section 4.1) accountable for delivering on the facility':;&#13;
objectives and principles, wi-h advice and support from the Advisory Partners. The comp( Et n of&#13;
the Governing Council will b- agreed between IBRD and prospective partners, but is pror cs sto&#13;
comprise representatives of Funding and Technical Partners.&#13;
3.3   An Advisory Counc il comprised of all GIF partners, chaired by the Managing Dii e: r&#13;
and Chief Financial Officer cf the World Bank Group, will be periodically convened to facil t:tt&#13;
coordination of GIF activities and support GIF operations. This Advisory Council will serve ;i 3&#13;

established for this purpose the GIF Management Unit). The GIF Management Unit will fir c on&#13;
as a coordinating body as pr)jects are identified for inclusion in the pipeline, and then mo '(&#13;
toward technical support anc financing phases. The GIF Management Unit will not lead ir :v iual&#13;
projects.&#13;
4.2   GIF activity implementation teams will be led by selected staff of Technical Partn( r&#13;
institutions, coordinated by the GIF Management Unit in consultation with client governm( rtc&#13;
according to specific project 'equirements and the project origination processes. CompoE it c of&#13;
the implementation teams may vary according to the need of individual projects and&#13;
governments.&#13;
5     Activities and Projects&#13;
5.1   Project selection cr iteria and processes could be developed to reflect the folio 1v n:&#13;
principles:&#13;
(i) Development Iripact-projects that support the development goals of the G F&#13;
partner institutio is;&#13;
(ii) Alignment-prciects that are aligned with recipient/sponsor country priorities E n,&#13;
strategies;&#13;
(iii) Complexity-pro)jects that require multiple parties to come together to provid a&#13;

&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(iv) Catalytic Impact-projects that have significant potential to achieve financia&#13;
viability, leverage public funds, and attract private sector and/or institutional&#13;
investors-such as through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-wl In ill&#13;
meeting govern nent's service delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrast*ucture investments that have global public good characterist .s such&#13;
as climate friendly-projec:s that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provisic n c&#13;
infrastructure services; and , rade enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconn,&lt; tr ity&#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of supp &gt;rt provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, wit 1: iew&#13;
to complementing the resou ces and support already available from partner entities and (1:11,&#13;
funding mechanisms. Durin( the GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following a:: ii ies,&#13;
corresponding to major project development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; project definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility sc (E  ing;&#13;
and legal, regukitory, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii)  Project preparat on and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and FPP structuring;&#13;
(iii) Transaction sup:ort and financial structuring - preparing and implementing&#13;
transactions, an J design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; anc&#13;
(iv) Financial arranging and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing finant iin&#13;
packages from i range of sources and partners,&#13;
6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies- including in particular the management of environmental anc  ial&#13;
impacts and risks, and trans )arency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrast c ire&#13;
projects in supporting sustai iable, inclusive development; as well as for investors in thost&#13;
projects to manage financial reputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supported operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements f :'&#13;
external implementing entitiEs under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an a )proach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards an:1 0 ier&#13;
standards and policies, and Jevelop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for G IF&#13;
Technical Partners who are expected to function as implementing entities for GIF activitie:;&#13;
