Rwanda&#13;
Demobilization and Reintegration Program&#13;
I   Background and Strategy&#13;
1.1  Circumstances of the Conflict&#13;
1. From 1990 to 1994. In October 1990, the forces of the Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA),&#13;
the military wing of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), launched an armed struggle&#13;
within Rwanda. The RPF was composed mainly of exiled Rwandese who had fled&#13;
political violence in the country in the 1950s and 1960s and had thereafter been denied&#13;
citizenship rights. The ensuing civil war disrupted economic and social activities and led&#13;
to significant population displacement. In response to RPA incursions, the govermnent&#13;
expanded the size of its armed forces (Forces Armees Rwandaises; FAR). After three&#13;
years of fighting, the conclusion of the Arusha Peace Agreement between the&#13;
Government and the RPF in August 1993 raised hopes for a peaceful resolution of the&#13;
war.&#13;
2. On April 6, 1994, following the assassination of the President of Rwanda, ethnic&#13;
extremists seized power and launched a campaign of genocide. During the following&#13;
three months, over one million Rwandese , mainly Tutsis and moderate Hutus from&#13;
opposition parties, were massacred. Fighting between the RPA and the FAR resumed&#13;
shortly after the assassination of the President. By mid-July 1994, the RPA forces&#13;
expelled the FAR and allied militia (interahamwe) from the country and brought the war&#13;
and genocide to an end. By mid-1 994, out of Rwanda's population of roughly 8 million at&#13;
the beginning of the 1990s, some 2 million had become displaced within Rwanda's&#13;
borders and close to an additional 2 million had fled as refugees to neighboring&#13;
countries.&#13;
3. From 1994 to 1998. Upon acceding to power, the new coalition Government&#13;
encouraged all Rwandese who had fled abroad to return to the country. However,&#13;
Rwandese armed groups comprised of ex-FAR and interahamwe continued to destabilize&#13;
the country from refugee camps in neighboring countries, especially those in former&#13;
Zaire.3 In August 1996, a coalition of ZaYrean rebel forces supported by the RPA&#13;
launched a military campaign to dismantle the refugee camps in eastern Zaire and topple&#13;
' Preliminary results from the genocide census undertaken by the Government in 2001 indicate that&#13;
1,074,017 Rwandese were killed during the genocide.&#13;
2 Minear, Larry and Randolph C., 1998, "Rwanda's Internally Displaced: A Conundrum within a&#13;
Conundrum", in R. Cohen and F. Deng (ed.), The Forsaken People (Washington D.C.: Brookings&#13;
Institution), p. 63.&#13;
3 Annex C of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement defines "Armed Groups" as "forces other than government&#13;
forces, RCD and MLC that are not signatories to this Agreement. They include ex-FAR, ..., Interahamwe&#13;
militias, ... and any other forces. ... Interahamwe means armed militias who carried out genocide in&#13;
Rwanda in 1994." For the purposes of the Program, "Armed Groups" means organized armed groups that&#13;
engaged in military activities against the RPA in Rwanda or the territory of the Democratic Republic of&#13;
Congo.&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex          2&#13;
the government of Mobutu Sese Seko. Many ex-FAR and refugees returned to Rwanda,&#13;
but others dispersed and fled deeper into Zaire. After the dismantling of the camps in&#13;
November and December 1996, the security situation in Rwanda improved markedly.&#13;
4. Relations betweerL the governments of the Democratic Republic of Congo (D'RC;&#13;
formerly Zaire) and Rwanida deteriorated again after 1997. The DRC government began&#13;
to provide military aid to Rwandese armed groups, who resumed cross-border incursions&#13;
into Rwanda. During the -first half of 1998, the number of displaced families in northwest&#13;
Rwanda increased to an estimated 360,000. To counter this security threat, the Rwandese&#13;
Government supported a new set of Congolese rebel movements emerging in the eastern&#13;
part of the DRC.&#13;
5. The current conflict. The conflict in the DRC re-escalated in August 1998 when&#13;
Rwandese and Ugandan forces entered the DRC to support the Congolese rebel&#13;
movements opposed to the new DRC government and to stop incursions by armed&#13;
groups.4 While this renewed intervention initially improved the security situation on the&#13;
Rwandese frontier with the DRC, it also spawned a complex civil war. This conflict has&#13;
embroiled the forces of the government of the DRC, three Congolese rebel movements,&#13;
up to seven African countries, and several disparate armed groups from the DRC and four&#13;
neighboring countries.&#13;
6. Prospects under the Lusaka Agreernent. Regional peace initiatives were taken to&#13;
resolve the conflict. This culminated in the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement of July 19995&#13;
which was brokered by the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations and&#13;
was signed by the Government of Rwanda. However, the provisions of this Agreement&#13;
were not implemented immediately. The DRC government and its allies continued to&#13;
provide military support to Rwandese armed groups, and foreign military forces&#13;
maintained their positions in the DRC.&#13;
7. After the death of the President of the DRC in January 2001, renewed efforts have&#13;
been made to implement the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. A considerable proportion of&#13;
foreign forces deployed in the DRC have withdrawn from the frontline or returned home.&#13;
In this improved security environment, the United Nations Organization Mission to&#13;
Congo (Mission de l'Organisation des Nations Unies au Congo; MONUC) has been able&#13;
to expand its presence in the DRC in order to monitor the ceasefire and verify the&#13;
withdrawal of various foreign forces.&#13;
8. Despite these positive developments, armed groups again tried to infiltrate the&#13;
northwestern parts of Rwanda in May 2001 6 With the support of the civilian population,&#13;
4 This event constitutes the extraordinary event of limited duration that triggers application of the Bank's&#13;
emergency procedures (OP 8.50). Unlike other IDA operations in Rwanda, under implementation or&#13;
planned, the RDRP would directly address the causes and effects of the emergency. Therefore, it shares the&#13;
urgency of the opportunity that exists under the Lusaka Agreement.&#13;
5 Two rebel leaders signed the Lusaka Agreement in August 1999.&#13;
6 The Rwandese armed group that attempted to infiltrate northwestern Rwanda has described itself as the&#13;
Army for the Liberation of Rwanda (ALIR). However, the ALIR is not recognized as a formal entity by the&#13;
Government of Rwanda..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex         3&#13;
about 2,000 combatants either surrendered to, or were captured by the RPA between May&#13;
and November 2001. The ex-combatants were assembled in the Nkumba and Mudende&#13;
solidarity camps where they were sensitized by the National Unity and Reconciliation&#13;
Commission (NURC) about the need for national reconciliation and about civilian life in&#13;
Rwanda. The Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Commission (RDRC) then&#13;
conducted a pre-discharge orientation course, collected socio-economic data, carried out&#13;
medical screening and HIV/AIDS voluntary counseling and testing, issued&#13;
demobilization identity cards, and handed out part of the Basic Needs Kit before&#13;
demobilizing them in December 2001.7&#13;
9. The combination of diplomatic progress under the Lusaka Agreement, the policy of the&#13;
Government of Rwanda to encourage the return and reintegration of members of&#13;
Rwandese armed groups, and the military progress of the RPA against these armed&#13;
groups in the eastern DRC have improved the prospects for a resolution of the Rwandese&#13;
dimension of the conflict. Government believes that a concerted effort to disarm the&#13;
remaining Rwandese armed groups in the DRC, repatriate them to Rwanda and&#13;
reintegrate them into Rwandese civil society is feasible within the context of the Lusaka&#13;
peace process and could bring an end to the persistent instability on the Rwanda-DRC&#13;
frontier that has dogged the relationship between the two countries and undermined&#13;
regional stability.&#13;
1.2 Economic and Social Impact&#13;
10. The legacy of the genocide and persistent insecurity continue to weigh heavily on&#13;
Rwanda. The genocide and the associated social and economic displacement exacerbated&#13;
the economic vulnerability of many Rwandese. Returned refugees, resettled internally&#13;
displaced persons (IDPs), the widows and orphans of the genocide, and the families of&#13;
the detained suspects of crimes of genocide are especially vulnerable. The persistent&#13;
instability on the DRC frontier has undermined prospects for economic recovery in parts&#13;
of the country adjacent to the DRC, which had historically been one of the most&#13;
prosperous regions of the country.&#13;
11. As a result of the continuing insecurity, defense spending remained at 4.3 percent of&#13;
GDP in 1998 and 4.2 percent in 1999. In 2001, defense spending decreased to 3.3 percent&#13;
of GDP and in real terms from FRw 27.0 billion to FRw 25.1 billion (see also table 5).&#13;
However, the fiscal deficit remained at over 10 percent of GDP in 2001. Defense&#13;
expenditures continue to be a significant burden on the national budget and limit the&#13;
Government's ability to implement its poverty reduction strategy.&#13;
7 About 300 child ex-combatants were transferred to Gitagata camp, which is managed by the Ministry of&#13;
Local Government and Social Affairs (MINALOC), from where they will be reunited with their families&#13;
after participating in sensitization and counseling activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex         4&#13;
1.3  Government Response and Strategy&#13;
12. The Government has been pursuing a dual strategy of military preparedness oni the&#13;
one hand, and reconciliation on the other, in its efforts to encourage the Rwandese armed&#13;
groups to lay down their arms. For example, in accordance with the provisions of the&#13;
Arusha Agreement, the RPA incorporatecd approximately 15,000 ex-FAR of the estimated&#13;
40,000 ex-FAR whco returned to Rwanda after the dissolution of the refugee camps in&#13;
1996. Those members of Rwandese armed groups who returned and were not implicated&#13;
in the genocide of 1994 have been allowed to resume civilian life.&#13;
13. The Rwanda Denzobilization and Reintegration Program. The Government&#13;
implemented the first stage of the Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program&#13;
(RDRP) between 1997-2001. Under stage I of the RDRP, which was implemented by the&#13;
RDRC, a total of 18,692 RPA soldiers (of whom 2,364 were child soldiers) were&#13;
demobilized in four phases between September 1997 and February 2001.9 This first stage&#13;
was co-financed by Government, various donors through a UNDP-administered trust&#13;
fund, and UN agencies. The Government did not request financial assistance from IDA&#13;
for this stage.&#13;
14. In May 2001, UNDP conducted an evaluation of the first stage of the RDR? and&#13;
found that the Program had recorded some achievements but also suffered from&#13;
significant shortcomings. The demobilization of a total of 18,692 soldiers as well as the&#13;
RDRC's referral of a significant number of ex-combatants' to education and employment&#13;
opportunities are considered the primary achievements of stage I. Furthermore, the&#13;
payment of reinsertion assistance enabled many ex-combatants to weather the transition&#13;
to civilian life.&#13;
15. However, the first stage of the RDRP was compromised by external political and&#13;
financial factors. The persistent insecurity on Rwanda's DRC frontier and Rwanda's&#13;
associated military engagement in the DRC, as well as the incorporation of 15,000 ex-&#13;
FAR in the RPA, impeded the Govemment's ability to reduce the overall size of the&#13;
RPA. As a result, no substantial reduction in military expenditure was recorded. In this&#13;
context, donors limited their financial assistance to the Program in response to the&#13;
deployment of RPA forces in the DRC. The resulting lack of financial resources limited&#13;
the Program's ability to provide adequate reintegration assistance to demobilized RPA&#13;
ex-combatants as well as to FAR ex-combatants who were not integrated into the RPA.&#13;
16. In addition, stage I of the Program was hampered by significant internal technical and&#13;
management shortcomiings. The technical capacity of the RDRC was insufficient to&#13;
ensure the quality of Program implementation. For example, inadequate pre-&#13;
demobilization counseling generated unrealistic expectations among ex-combatants, a&#13;
micro-credit scheme was implemented poorly, and a village that was established&#13;
specifically for disabled ex-combatants has proven to be unsustainable. In addition,&#13;
s Of these 40,000 ex-FAR, 10,000 are assumed to have returned to the DRC since the onset of incursions in&#13;
May 1997.&#13;
9 The child soldiers were demobilized in 1995 by being transferred to a special primary school (see&#13;
paragraphs 99-101).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex                5&#13;
essential technical assistance was not forthcoming and donors were not adequately&#13;
appraised of implementation progress.&#13;
17. From this stage I experience, Government has learned key lessons, including the&#13;
following:&#13;
(i)    the establishment of a strong Technical Secretariat is critical to ensure&#13;
necessary planning, coordination and implementation;&#13;
(ii)   substantial pre-demobilization  counseling  should  be provided  to  ex-&#13;
combatants in order to manage their expectations;&#13;
(iii)  significant economic reintegration assistance is necessary and should be&#13;
tailored to the ex-combatants' socio-economic characteristics, capabilities and&#13;
expectations;&#13;
(iv)   the provision of information, referral and counseling services through&#13;
decentralized implementation structures can be effective;&#13;
(v)    disabled ex-combatants require targeted medical and economic assistance;&#13;
(vi)   a comprehensive management information system is essential to inform the&#13;
decision-making of the RDRC; and&#13;
(vii)  the mobilization of timely and sufficient donor financial assistance and strong&#13;
donor coordination are critical.&#13;
18. As a result of its experience to date, Government has concluded that a fundamental&#13;
redesign of the Program is necessary before the initiation of stage II. Government has&#13;
asked the World Bank to lead efforts to revamp the Program, provide financial assistance&#13;
(the "Credit"), initiate international resource mobilization efforts, and coordinate donor&#13;
support to stage II of the RDRP.&#13;
19. Guiding principles. The Government has adopted the following guiding principles for&#13;
the second stage of the RDRP:&#13;
(i)    in the interest of national reconciliation, the Program would target all ex-&#13;
combatants'0 irrespective of previous military affiliation;&#13;
(ii)  the RDRP would allow       ex-combatants to choose their community of&#13;
settlement and their path to economic reintegration;&#13;
(iii)  to ensure consistency and fairness, all assistance to ex-combatants would be&#13;
provided through the national RDRP developed and supervised by the RDRC;&#13;
(iv)   reintegration assistance would seek to foster community participation;&#13;
'1 For the purposes of the Program, "ex-combatant" means: (i) any RPA soldier demobilized after 1995 or&#13;
to be demobilized after the date of the Credit agreement; (ii) any ex-FAR soldier who remained in, or&#13;
returned to, Rwanda after July 1994 or returns to Rwanda after the date of the agreement and did not join&#13;
any armed group; or (iii) any member of an armned group who is a Rwandan national and returns to Rwanda&#13;
after May 2001.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization andl Reintegration Program - Technical Annex       6&#13;
(v)   the RDRC would rely on existing Government structures to the extent&#13;
possible in order to build sustainable capacities beyond the Program's&#13;
duration; and&#13;
(vi)  pension and social security issues for ex-RPA and ex-FAR would be&#13;
addressed outside the RDRP, in accordance with their respective terms and&#13;
conditions of service.&#13;
20. Target groups. For the second stage of the RDRP, the Government envisages the&#13;
demobilization and reintegration of 20,000 RPA soldiers and 25,000 members of armed&#13;
groups returning from outside the country (including the 1,735 recently demobilized from&#13;
Mudende and Nkumba)." In addition, the Program would provide reinsertion assistance&#13;
to 15,000 ex-FAR who returned before stage II as well as economic reintegration&#13;
assistance to an estimated 12,000 RPA and FAR ex-combatants who did not receive&#13;
adequate assistance during stage I of the Program and who remain economically&#13;
vulnerable.&#13;
21. The inclusion of ex-combatants of armed groups in stage II of the RDRP is&#13;
considered an important national reconciliation measure. A successful demobilization and&#13;
reintegration program would demonstrate that members of armed groups can return to a&#13;
secure and peaceful civilian life in Rwanda. This would serve as an incentive for the&#13;
voluntary disarmament and return of members of Rwandese armed groups still active in&#13;
the region.&#13;
22. Timing. Given the continuing uncertainty concerning the security situation in the&#13;
Great Lakes region, the actual RPA demobilization calendar, and lack of data about the&#13;
exact number of the members of armed groups as well as the timing of their repatriation&#13;
to Rwanda, the Program would need to retain considerable implementation and financial&#13;
flexibility. Therefore, the Program account would maintain a substantial minimum&#13;
balance. Overall Program cost estimates would be adjusted in line with overall&#13;
beneficiary numbers. Donors would be asked to maintain sufficient resources in reserve&#13;
and available for rapid disbursement as required by Prograrn implementation prog-ess.&#13;
Program implementation capacity in the RDRC would be strengthened as a matter of&#13;
urgency in anticipation of a possible influx of ex-combatants from the DRC.&#13;
1.4  Intemational Response&#13;
23. Direct assistance in Rwanda. In general, the international community is supportive of&#13;
efforts towards the demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants in Rwanda.&#13;
Notwithstanding Rwanda's military engagement in the DRC, donors and UN agencies&#13;
provided approximately US$9.5 million in support of the first stage of the RI)RP.&#13;
International partners have indicated that a renewed demobilization and reintegration&#13;
effort in Rwanda could be a timely and important regional peace-building measure.&#13;
" An estimated 30,000 members of armed groups are expected to return to Rwanda over the next two&#13;
years. About 5,000 of these would be incorporated in the RPA in the spirit of national reconciliation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex      7&#13;
24. In particular, donors welcome the inclusion of ex-combatants from armed groups as&#13;
an important signal of Government commitment to national reconciliation and to the&#13;
Lusaka peace process. Several bilateral partners have indicated that they consider&#13;
financial contributions to the RDRP. However, several donors have indicated that their&#13;
support to any new stage of the RDRP would be linked to the withdrawal of RPA forces&#13;
from the DRC in the context of the implementation of the Lusaka peace process,&#13;
increased Government transparency regarding the security sector, and a net reduction in&#13;
the size of the RPA. Government has given related assurances to IDA.&#13;
25. Links to the Lusaka Process. The international community is also actively engaged in&#13;
the implementation of the Lusaka Agreement. In particular, MONUC has recently been&#13;
mandated to initiate phase III of its deployment in the DRC. This phase will include an&#13;
expansion of MONUC activities in support of the voluntary disarmament and&#13;
demobilization of members of armed groups from neighboring countries operating in the&#13;
DRC, and their repatriation to their countries of origin or their resettlement within the&#13;
DRC or in third countries.&#13;
26. Paragraph 22 of the Lusaka Cease-Fire Agreement stipulates that "countries of origin&#13;
of members of the armed groups, commit themselves to taking all the necessary measures&#13;
to facilitate their repatriation". The second stage of the RDRP would go beyond this&#13;
provision by providing targeted reinsertion and reintegration assistance to returning&#13;
members of armed groups. Consequently, the RDRP would form an essential part of the&#13;
Government of Rwanda's implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and complement the&#13;
Disannament, Demobilization, Reintegration, Resettlement or Repatriation (DDRRR)&#13;
efforts of MONUC. The Bank is in close contact with MONUC and other parts of the UN&#13;
system including UNDP to ensure coordination and complementarity of activities both in&#13;
Rwanda and the DRC.&#13;
2 IDA Response and Strategy&#13;
2.1  Regional Multi-Country Program for Demobilization and Reintegration&#13;
27. Building on a variety of country-level initiatives, and in consultation with&#13;
governments in the region and donor and UN partners, the Bank has initiated the&#13;
preparation of a greater Great Lakes regional strategy for demobilization and&#13;
reintegration as well as a multi-country demobilization and reintegration program&#13;
(MDRP). The regional strategy and MDRP provide a comprehensive framework in&#13;
support of individual country-level programs, such as the RDRP. It would be expected to&#13;
the Board in conjunction with the RDRP.&#13;
28. A multi-country umbrella approach would have several key advantages, including the&#13;
facilitation of feedback relationships among country programs in the region; the creation&#13;
of synergies that would enable the MDRP to have a greater impact than individual&#13;
country programs could have; the provision of similar incentives for all parties to the&#13;
conflict to pursue peaceful strategies; the ability to address the regional externalities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex      8&#13;
associated with some individual programs; enhanced transparency of closely relaited&#13;
country programs; and the facilitation of knowledge-sharing and training across national&#13;
programs.&#13;
29. The MDRP would serve as a framework for a regional multi-donor trust fmnd&#13;
(MDTF) for demobilization and reintegration activities in the greater Great Lakes region.&#13;
The MDTF would seive as the vehicle to mobilize and channel key donor financing;&#13;
reduce transaction costs for client governments, donors and the Bank; and enable&#13;
Governments to complement IDA credits wth grant resources (see paragraphs 144-145).&#13;
2.2  Poverty Reduction Strategy&#13;
30. Poverty Reduction Stragety Paper (PRSP). The Government of Rwanda launched its&#13;
National Poverty Reduction Program in June 2000. A full PRSP has been finalized and&#13;
was presented to donors in November 2001. Rwanda's long-term vision (Vision 2020)&#13;
emphasizes national reconciliation and security, democratization, good governance and&#13;
political stability, human resource development, decentralized and efficient public&#13;
administration, and regional integration as the key elements to sustain peace, create&#13;
prosperity and reduce poverty.&#13;
31. Recognizing the legacies of the genocide, the structural constraints related to land,&#13;
demography, agriculture and human resources, and the institutional weaknesses in the&#13;
public and private sectors as the key challenges to medium-term socio-economic&#13;
transformation, the PRSP proposes actions which can be summarized along three broad&#13;
themes:&#13;
(i)   post-conflict reintegration and reconciliation with the objective to stabilize the&#13;
situation of those living in new settlements, address the problems of&#13;
vulnerable groups, foster national reintegration and reconciliation, and&#13;
promote regional peace;&#13;
(ii)  accelerated poverty reduction efforts through: (a) mainstreaming poverty&#13;
reduction in the development agenda and reallocating expenditures to support&#13;
poverty reduction priorities; (b) developing a dynamic rural economy; (c)&#13;
promoting the competitiveness of private enterprises; (d) developing human&#13;
resources including empowering women and fighting HIV/AIDS; and (e)&#13;
improving economic infrastructure; and&#13;
(iii)  improved effectiveness of the public sector to provide the enabling&#13;
environment for national reconciliation and sustainable economic growth and&#13;
poverty reduction.&#13;
32. The RDRP has been designed to conform to and enhance the objectives outlined in&#13;
the Governance section of the PRSP. The RDRP forms one of the core programs of the&#13;
Government's poverty reduction strategy.&#13;
33. Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). A CAS for Rwanda is expected to be presented&#13;
to the Board later in FY02. The CAS reflects the Bank's support for the Government's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex         9&#13;
program to overcome the legacies of the genocide, foster economic growth and reduce&#13;
poverty. The CAS considers the demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants to be&#13;
a key peace-building process. The support of the international community for the MDRP&#13;
(paragraphs 27-29), is deemed essential for progress in the regional and domestic peace&#13;
processes. Being part of the base case scenario presented in the CAS, the proposed IDA&#13;
Credit for the RDRP is fully consistent with the CAS.&#13;
34. Restructuring of existing credits. The current IDA portfolio consists of ten projects&#13;
with satisfactory performance. None of these projects is compatible in design with the&#13;
RDRP. Nevertheless, to ensure the maximum exploitation of synergies and in order to&#13;
build on lessons learned, Governmuent would establish links between the RDRP and&#13;
several ongoing operations. In particular, the experience gained under the Community&#13;
Reintegration and Development Project (CRDP) would be applied to design community-&#13;
based reintegration options for ex-combatants. Under the CRDP, community&#13;
development committees (CDCs), which are the development arm of the district&#13;
administrations, have designed and implemented sub-projects for the benefit of their&#13;
communities. This has proved to be a successful model of rural community&#13;
empowerment and decentralized project implementation, and has subsequently been&#13;
incorporated in the Government's decentralization policy.&#13;
i.3  Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
35. The Government's request for technical and financial assistance for the second stage&#13;
of the RDRP has come at a critical time in the regional peace process. IDA's involvement&#13;
is justified by its considerable experience with such programs, the scale of resources&#13;
required for the Program, the focus of the Program on sustainable economic reintegration&#13;
of ex-combatants, and the need for IDA to be responsive to a client request to lead and&#13;
coordinate international support for a critical regional peace-building operation. IDA&#13;
support would complement the activities of other international stakeholders in Rwanda&#13;
and the region.&#13;
36. Needfor emergency assistance. The emergency is the extraordinary event of limited&#13;
duration which started in August 1998, and which was caused by the escalation of the&#13;
armed conflict in Rwanda and the subsequent military involvement of the RPA in the war&#13;
in the territory of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The impact of the emergency on&#13;
the northwestern provinces has been profound. Due to insurgencies and insecurity, an&#13;
estimated 108,000 families, nearly 60 percent of the population, still live under plastic&#13;
sheeting or banana tree leaves in the provinces of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri.  The&#13;
application of the Bank's emergency procedures under OP 8.50 is justified on the basis of&#13;
the following criteria:&#13;
(i)   Impact on economic priorities and investment programs. A successfully&#13;
implemented RDRP would help consolidate stability in Rwanda and the&#13;
region, support macroeconomic stability, and increase investments.&#13;
12 Ministry of Lands, Human Resettlement and Environmental Protection. Brookings Initiative in Rwanda,&#13;
pp. 16ff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex      10&#13;
(ii)  Frequency. There is general agreement that the peace process can be&#13;
consolidated with specific stabilization measures. Government and donors&#13;
agree that t]he RDRP would be a. critical element in this process.&#13;
(iii)  Urgency. 1,735 members of Rwandese armed groups have recently been&#13;
demobilized. Others are expected to return to Rwanda in the near futuire.&#13;
Urgent measures are needed to demobilize and reintegrate these ex-&#13;
combatants in a structured manner.&#13;
(iv)  Prospects for reducing future hazards. Discontented ex-combatants could&#13;
pose a threat to social stability. At the same time, lack of proper&#13;
demobilization and reintegration support may contribute to a stalling of the&#13;
peace process.&#13;
(v)   Expected economic benefits. The Program would provide the Government the&#13;
means to consolidate the social and economic recovery following the setbacks&#13;
caused by the persistent insecurity in the Great Lakes region.&#13;
37. Making resources available for development. The persistent insecurity in the Great&#13;
Lakes region has led to the diversion of scarce resources from economic and social&#13;
sectors to the security sector. The RDRP is expected to facilitate the reallocation of&#13;
Government resources from defense to economic and social investments. The reduction&#13;
of defense spending would furthermore help ease the fiscal deficit, and is thus an&#13;
important factor to achieving macroeconomic and fiscal balance in the longer term.&#13;
Finally, the (re-)entry of an estimated 45,000 persons to the labor market is expected to&#13;
increase national output.&#13;
2.4  Lessons from Previous IDA Assistance&#13;
38. IDA has gained substantial experience from a number of demobilization and&#13;
reintegration programs it has supported in Africa and elsewhere. Such assistance has&#13;
often taken the form of technical and/or financial support through investment credits,&#13;
budget support programns or through reallocations from ongoing projects. Based on&#13;
information from these operations, a review of relevant experiences in selected Afiican&#13;
countries, and the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department's evaluations, the followiing&#13;
best practices were identified and integrated in Program design.&#13;
39. Demobilization. This phase is short but logistically complex. The successful&#13;
implementation of demobilization activities is a precondition for the subsequent provision&#13;
of targeted reinsertion and reintegration assistance. Key demobilization activities include&#13;
the distribution of non-transferable ID cards, the collection of socio-economic data and&#13;
the establishment of a database on the beneficiary population. Furthermore, the assembly&#13;
of ex-combatants during the demobilization phase provides a good opportunity for health&#13;
counseling and HIV/AIDS education and voluntary testing, as well as the dissemination&#13;
of information about program benefits and civilian life.&#13;
40. Reinsertion. Upon demobilization, the ex-combatants lose their source of (formal or&#13;
informal) income. Experience suggests that they are usually in a vulnerable financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex       11&#13;
situation until they can generate income. During this period (the "reinsertion" phase), ex-&#13;
combatants require a transitional safety net to cover their families' basic material needs.&#13;
The objective of this transitional assistance would be to enable the ex-combatants to&#13;
return to their community and to sustain themselves and their families for a limited period&#13;
immediately following demobilization.&#13;
41. Economic reintegration. Ex-combatants are often an economically vulnerable group&#13;
as they lack marketable skills, material assets and social networks. In addition, they are&#13;
often a high-risk group due to their familiarity with weapons and violence. Where this is&#13;
the case, targeted support is advisable to help them establish sustainable livelihoods. In&#13;
order to be relevant and cost-effective, such assistance should be tailored to their socio-&#13;
economic profile and adjusted to the economic environment. Female ex-combatants often&#13;
require customized support to establish sustainable livelihoods.&#13;
42. In general, ex-combatants should receive no more support than is necessary to help&#13;
them attain the general standard of living of the communities into which they reintegrate.&#13;
Furthermore, reintegration assistance should be limited in time to avoid the creation of a&#13;
dependency syndrome. Information, counseling and referral services can assist ex-&#13;
combatants to assess their liveiihood options and find employment. Apprenticeships in&#13;
the informal sector combine the benefits of vocational training and employment and are&#13;
thus preferable to training only. Micro-projects can help ex-combatants secure their&#13;
economic independence and self-employment. They are, however, also complex&#13;
interventions that require significant administrative capacity and a stable market&#13;
environment.&#13;
43. Ultimately, ex-combatants are reintegrated into a broader economic context. The&#13;
creation of viable long-term employment opportunities for ex-combatants is closely&#13;
linked to private sector growth and associated employment generation. It should be noted&#13;
that ex-combatants themselves provide a significant human resource contribution to the&#13;
civilian economy.&#13;
44. Social reintegration. Social reintegration is often eased by the support of an extended&#13;
family network. Therefore, ex-combatants should be encouraged to reintegrate in the&#13;
vicinity of their extended families. Informal networks of ex-combatants - discussion&#13;
groups, ex-combatants associations, joint economic ventures - are important elements to&#13;
successful economic and social reintegration. Efforts to provide assistance to ex-&#13;
combatants' communities of return can offer incentives for collaboration and acceptance,&#13;
thereby strengthening social capital. Child ex-combatants should be reunified with their&#13;
families wherever possible and assisted to resume their education. Disabled ex-&#13;
combatants commonly require specialized medical and economic assistance.&#13;
45. Care should be taken to prevent the stigmatization of ex-combatants as unfit for&#13;
military service or as conveyers of disease and violence. Community sensitization and&#13;
information efforts are paramount in this regard. The fears of communities related to the&#13;
return of ex-combatants should also be addressed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Progran - Technical Annex      12&#13;
46. Institutional issues. Program coordination by one civilian agency with overall&#13;
program responsibility, balanced by decentralization of implementation to regions and&#13;
communities makes for a powerful institutional arrangement. Where possible, existing&#13;
implementation capacities should be leveraged. The employment of ex-combatants as&#13;
counselors and field staff can facilitate reintegration.&#13;
3 The Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program&#13;
3.1  Eligibility Criteria&#13;
47. The RDRP is part of the Multi-Country Demobilization and Reintegration Program&#13;
for the greater Great Lakes region. Within the MDRP, the following criteria need to be&#13;
fulfilled for a country to be eligible to receive assistance for the demobilization and&#13;
reintegration of ex-combatants:&#13;
General criteria&#13;
(i)   Affected by conflict. Being involved in or directly affected by one or more&#13;
of the conflicts in the greater Great Lakes region.&#13;
(ii)  Participation in the regional peace process. Demonstrated willingness to&#13;
contribute to stability in the greater Great Lakes region and to implement&#13;
relevant provisions of the applicable peace/ceasefire accord(s).&#13;
Country-specific criteria&#13;
(i)   Preparation of a national DRP as a result of the conflict(s). This would&#13;
typically be demonstrated by a coherent national program developed in&#13;
consultation with the international community and national stakeholders.&#13;
It could also be demonstrated by having a strategic planning and&#13;
consultation process underway, with a clear roadmap and timetable.&#13;
(ii)  Establishment of a suitable institutional structure. The government would&#13;
establish flexible implementation arrangements with significant planning,&#13;
coordination and monitoring capacity and with appropriate participation of&#13;
relevant political and security stakeholders.&#13;
(iii)  A letter of demobilization policy outlining government commitment. The&#13;
Governmenit would draft a letter in which it outlines its commitments to&#13;
the regional peace process, demobilization and reintegration, security&#13;
sector reform and fiscal impact of demobilization.&#13;
(iv)  Establishment of appropriate safeguards and fiduciary measures. The&#13;
government would provide assurances and monitoring measures to ensure&#13;
consistency with standard environmental and social safeguards. In&#13;
addition, government would establish satisfactory financial management&#13;
and procurement arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex           13&#13;
48. The Government of Rwanda has fulfilled all general and country-specific criteria and&#13;
is therefore eligible to receive financial assistance under the MDRP through IDA and the&#13;
regional MDTF.&#13;
3.2  Objectives&#13;
49. The overall goal of the second stage of the RDRP would be to help consolidate peace&#13;
in the Great Lakes region and foster reconciliation within Rwanda. The four principal&#13;
objectives of the Program would be to:&#13;
(i)    demobilize an estimated 45,000 ex-combatants from the RPA and members of&#13;
armed groups, and support their transition to civilian life;&#13;
(ii)  in the spirit of the Arusha Agreement, support the reinsertion of ex-FAR;&#13;
(iii)  support the social and economic reintegration of all ex-combatants to be&#13;
demobilized in stage II and all stage I ex-combatants who remain socio-&#13;
economically vulnerable; and&#13;
(iv)   facilitate the reallocation of Government expenditure from defense to social&#13;
and economic sectors.&#13;
50. This Program is expected to have a significant impact on reducing poverty in&#13;
Rwanda, by: freeing up additional national resources for investment in social and&#13;
economic sectors; investing in the human capital of ex-combatants; and enhancing the&#13;
implementation capacity of community-based development organizations.&#13;
3.3  Coverage and Implementation Period&#13;
51. Target groups. For the second stage of the RDRP, the Government envisages the&#13;
following target groups:&#13;
(i)   the demobilization and reintegration of 20,000 RPA soldiers;'3&#13;
(ii)  the demobilization and reintegration of an estimated 25,000 members of&#13;
armed groups returning from outside the country, including approximately&#13;
2,500 child ex-combatants14;&#13;
(iii)  the provision of reinsertion assistance to 15,000 ex-FAR who were not&#13;
incorporated into the RPA;&#13;
(iv)  the provision of economic and social reintegration assistance to an estimated&#13;
12,000 vulnerable ex-combatants from stage I of the Program;'5 and&#13;
13 Government has also indicated that a further reduction in force of the RPA may be possible in the&#13;
medium-term if the regional security environment improves significantly.&#13;
14 There were 262 child ex-combatants among the 2,000 members of armed groups having returned to&#13;
Rwanda since May 2001, or 13 percent. It is assumed that overall for stage II, children would represent&#13;
about 10 percent of anned groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Prograrn - Technical Annex            14&#13;
(v)    the provision of specialized assistance to disabled and child ex-combatants.&#13;
52. RPA soldiers would be demobilized on the basis of the following broad criteria:&#13;
voluntary termination, service requirement, age and medical reasons (disability, chronic&#13;
illness, etc.).&#13;
53. The identification of a member of a Rwandese armed group and the verification of&#13;
his/her status of combatant become an essential task to avoid that non-combatants benefit&#13;
from the Program. The Government would verify eligibility of members of Rwandese&#13;
arned groups on the basis of the following general criteria:&#13;
(i)    Rwandese nationality;&#13;
(ii)   self-identification of combatant status;&#13;
(iii)  proven affiliation with a known and organized armed group that engaged in&#13;
military fighting against the RPA in Rwanda or the territory of the Democratic&#13;
Republic of Congo; and&#13;
(iv)   proof of military ability (e.g., weapons handling).&#13;
54. The Government would coordinate with MONUC and Joint Military Commission&#13;
(JMC) as well as concerned parties to the DRC conflict to ensure systematic and rigorous&#13;
application of these criteria. Their application would be further specified in the Program&#13;
implementation manual of the RDRP.&#13;
55. The screening of members of armed groups for crimes committed against humanity&#13;
would be critically important. Members of the Rwandese armed groups who have not&#13;
been involved in the genocide of 1994 would be included in the Program. Procedures for&#13;
genocide screening are well established and have been applied since the promulgation of&#13;
the genocide law of 1996. Those who are disarmed by the Government of Rwanda and&#13;
are suspected of participation in the genocide would be tried according to the provisions&#13;
of the gacaca law of 2000.16 Those who disarm voluntarily to MONUC in the DRC and&#13;
are suspected of organizing the genocide (category 1 of the genocide law) would be&#13;
handed over to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).&#13;
56. The reintegration of approximately 45,000 ex-combatants poses particular challenges&#13;
in Rwanda, a densely populated and land-scarce country still recovering from the&#13;
traumatic impact of the genocide. Care would, therefore, be taken not to turn ex-&#13;
combatants into an overly privileged population group among the many other vulnerable&#13;
groups in the country (including genocide survivors, old caseload and new caseload&#13;
15 The UNDP evaluation of the first stage of the RDRP estimates that approximately 30 percent of ex-&#13;
combatants have found a job in the formal sector, another 40 percent are believed to be self-employed. The&#13;
remaining 30 percent are considered unemployed and/or involved in small-scale agriculture or occasional&#13;
farming jobs. For the second stage of the RDRP, it is assumed that approximately 35 percent of ex-&#13;
combatants of stages I and II are vulnerable and require special reintegration support.&#13;
16 Those found not guilty of genocide after a legal process would be able to access benefits within the&#13;
framework of the Program. Those convicted of genocide or crimes against humanity would not benefit&#13;
under the Program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex               15&#13;
refugees, IDPs, etc.). At the same time, meaningful reinsertion and reintegration support&#13;
for ex-combatants is necessary to reduce the risk of a negative social and economic&#13;
impacts, which could potentially undermine national stability.&#13;
57. Geographical coverage. Reintegration activities would focus on those areas to which&#13;
ex-combatants return. As was the case in stage I, the settlement pattern of future ex-&#13;
combatants is expected to be scattered." Thus, Program benefits would be spread&#13;
throughout the country as well. To facilitate rapid Program start-up while allowing time&#13;
to build capacities in other parts of the country, reintegration activities under stage II&#13;
would be prioritized by province according to the settlement pattern of ex-combatants,&#13;
and implementation capacities at the provincial and community levels.&#13;
58. Duration. The Program would be implemented over a period of three years. The&#13;
planned Program completion date is June 30, 2005.&#13;
3.4  Program Components&#13;
59. The second stage of the RDRP would contain five components'8&#13;
(i)    demobilization, including HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation measures;&#13;
(ii)   reinsertion;&#13;
(iii)  reintegration;&#13;
(iv)   special groups; and&#13;
(v)    institutional development and Program implementation support (chapters 4&#13;
and 5).&#13;
3.4.1 Demobilization&#13;
60. The demobilization of 20,000 ex-combatants from the RPA would be completed in&#13;
four phases of 5,000 each over a period of 18 months, starting in April 2002. The&#13;
demobilization of RPA ex-combatants would take no more than 15 days per phase. The&#13;
demobilization of the 25,000 ex-combatants from Rwandese armed groups would be&#13;
undertaken on an ongoing basis as and when they return to Rwanda. The demobilization&#13;
in December 2001 of the 1,735 adult members of armed groups from Mudende and&#13;
Nkumba served as a pilot for stage II of the RDRP. The demobilization of armed groups&#13;
17 Approximately 60 percent of the ex-combatants demobilized during the first stage of the RDRP settled in&#13;
the four provinces of Kigali rural, Kigali city, Kibungo and Butare. According to socio-economic data&#13;
collected by the RDRC, an estimated 60% of members of armed groups demobilized from the camps in&#13;
Mudende and Nkumba originate from the provinces of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri.&#13;
'8 Disarmament would be undertaken outside the Program following established procedures. The&#13;
disarmament of RPA soldiers and members of armed groups who surrender to the RPA would be&#13;
undertaken by the RPA prior to their transport to the demobilization centers. MONUC would be&#13;
responsible for (i) the disarmament of members of Rwandese armed groups in the DRC who report&#13;
voluntarily to MONUC, (ii) their temporary encampment in the DRC, and (iii) their repatriation to Rwanda.&#13;
These costs would be borne by MONUC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and_Reintegration Program - Technical Annex        16&#13;
would require up to 45 days per group, as they would receive more extensi ve&#13;
reconciliation counseling.&#13;
61. The RDRC would establish at least one (lemobilization center for the RPA (Muhazi in&#13;
Kibungo) and one for the armed groups (Mutobo in Ruhengeri).19 Each center would&#13;
initially have a capacity of 1,500. The RDRC would expand their capacity andlor&#13;
establish additional centers as necessary. To the extent possible, demobilization&#13;
procedures for RPA sol]diers and returning members of armed groups would be similar.&#13;
The following activities would be envisaged for all ex-combatants in the demobilization&#13;
phase.&#13;
62. Discharge of RPA Soldiers. Prior to their arrival in the demobilization center, the&#13;
soldiers of the RPA would be legally discharged. They would be provided with discharge&#13;
letters confirming the termination of their military service. The RPA would disarm&#13;
discharged soldiers prior to their transport to demobilization center.&#13;
63. Arrival procedures for repatriated armed groups. Upon arrival in Rwanda, members&#13;
of armed groups would fall under the authority of the RDRC. An initial screening would&#13;
be undertaken immediately upon arrival to pre-identify combatants.20 The Commission&#13;
would then ensure their transport to the demobilization center where, immediately upon&#13;
arrival, they would be required to sign a form acknowledging and renouncing their&#13;
combatant status.&#13;
64. Child ex-combatanis would be separated from adult members of armed groups after&#13;
the initial screening and be transported to the special demobilization center in Gitagata&#13;
(Kigali Ngali). At this time, 262 child ex-combatants have been housed in this center,&#13;
which is managed by the Ministry of Local Government and Social Affairs (MINALOC)&#13;
with the assistance of UNICEF.&#13;
65. Verification. As a next step, the eligibility of each arriving candidate would be&#13;
verified. The identity of RPA ex-combatants would be determined using their military ID&#13;
card and/or discharge letter. The ID number would be compared with a list of soldiers to&#13;
be demobilized provided by the RPA. The identification of members of armed groups by&#13;
the RDRC would be based on the criteria outlined in paragraph 53 above. Upon&#13;
verification of status, ex-combatants would be provided with basic goods for their stay in&#13;
the demobilization cernter. Non ex-combatants would be handed over to the Joint&#13;
Commission for Repatriation and Reintegration of Rwandese Refugees (JCRRR).&#13;
66. ID card. Ex-combatants to be supported under stage II would each be provided with&#13;
non-transferable RDRP identification documents (IDs). To ensure security, these would&#13;
be individually numbered, signed, stamped, laminated, and contain a photograph.&#13;
Additional security features may be added if necessary. ID cards would be identical&#13;
'9 The solidarity camps in Mudende and Nkumba were temporary arrangements for ex-combatants. W'ith&#13;
the demobilization of the armed groups completed, Government will return the facilities to their respeclive&#13;
owners.&#13;
20 The repatriation of non-Rwandese would be undertaken in consultation with MONUC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex         17&#13;
irrespective of former military affiliation. ID cards for child ex-combatants would note&#13;
their special status.&#13;
67. Socio-economic profile. A socio-economic profile of all ex-combatants to be&#13;
supported under stage II would be conducted by the Technical Secretariat of the RDRC,&#13;
in order to inform the design of targeted reintegration assistance measures. The profile&#13;
would include information on demographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status,&#13;
number of children, etc.), assets, education level, health status, needs and aspirations. All&#13;
data would be integrated in the Program's Management Information System (MIS).&#13;
68. Pre-demobilization orientation (PDO). Pre-demobilization orientation (counseling)&#13;
would provide ex-combatants with critical information about Program benefits,&#13;
implementation arrangements at the central and local levels, economic reintegration&#13;
opportunities, health issues (including sensitization on HIV/AIDS, reproductive health,&#13;
etc.), and civic rights and duties (including women's legal rights). The orientation&#13;
program would be organized in modules and would be carried out by a mixed group of&#13;
military/civilian staff. The Technical Secretariat would identify and train counselors and&#13;
appropriate counseling materials would be prepared. The PDO would seek to minimize&#13;
the generation of unrealistic expectations about Program benefits.&#13;
69. Medical screening. Ex-combatants would be screened to identify serious diseases or&#13;
impairments that may affect their ability for economic and social reintegration.&#13;
Furthermore, sensitization and voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for HIV/AIDS&#13;
would be offered (see chapter 3.4.5). To this end, medical teams would be established&#13;
and would comprise members of military and civilian health authorities. Specialized&#13;
agencies/NGOs would be contracted if necessary.&#13;
70. Distribution of vouchers. The Technical Secretariat would organize the distribution of&#13;
computer-generated, numbered vouchers to enable eligible ex-combatants to access the&#13;
Recognition of Service Allowance (RSA). Each voucher would have three stubs, one for&#13;
the beneficiary, one for the Technical Secretariat and one for the paying office.&#13;
71. Transport to communities of return. As part of the Basic Needs Kit (paragraph 73),&#13;
the Technical Secretariat would provide transport allowances in cash to enable ex-&#13;
combatants to travel from the demobilization centers to their chosen areas of return. Ex-&#13;
combatants would be required to report to their Provincial Program Office within fifteen&#13;
days of their departure from the demobilization center.21&#13;
3.4.2 Reinsertion&#13;
72. All ex-combatants demobilized in stage II of the RDRP would receive a Basic Needs&#13;
Kit (BNK). RPA ex-combatants demobilized in stage II would additionally receive a&#13;
21 Ex-combatants who wish to move from one province to another in the course of the Program would be&#13;
required to register with the Provincial Program Office in his/her new area of settlement in order to access&#13;
Program benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex               18&#13;
Recognition of Service Allowance (RSA). The RSA would also be extended to ex-F.AR&#13;
ex-combatants.&#13;
73. Basic Needs Kit. rhe BNK would provide the following assistance to facilitate the&#13;
initial transition to civilian life of ex-combatants: (i) food for a period of 3 months; (ii)&#13;
seeds and tools; (iii) basic household items; and (iv) transport to the community of&#13;
settlement. On the basis of the prevailing costs of the above items in Rwanda, the BNK.&#13;
would amount to a value of FRw50,000 per beneficiary. The BNK would be provided in&#13;
a combination of in-kind and cash to ex-combatants. The BNK would be provided to all&#13;
ex-combatants prior to their departure from the demobilization centers or immediately&#13;
upon arrival in the province of settlement.22&#13;
74. Recognition of Service Allowance. A recognition of service allowance would be paid&#13;
to those ex-combatants who were former professional soldiers and hence civil servants.&#13;
RPA ex-combatants demobilized in stage II would receive a Recognition of Service&#13;
Allowance (RSA) as part of their reinsertion assistance. The amount of the RSA would&#13;
be differentiated by rank, as has been the practice during stage I. The basic benefit for&#13;
private soldiers would be FRwI50,000 (US$330). The RSA would be staggered by rank&#13;
up to a maximum total of FRw500,000 (US$1,100).23 The average benefit would amount&#13;
to FRwl6O,000 (US$350).24&#13;
75. Stage II of the RDRP would also provide the RSA to FAR ex-combatants, for having&#13;
upheld the principles of the Arusha Peace Agreement.25 The ex-FAR ex-combatants&#13;
would be eligible upon registration at their respective RDRP Provincial Program Office.&#13;
Their RSA would be differentiated by the rank they held before April 6, 1994, using the&#13;
same baseline and scale as the RPA.&#13;
76. The RSA would be paid in cash for the following reasons:&#13;
(i)    the RDRC has paid cash to ex-combatants demobilized in stage I, thus selting&#13;
a precedent;&#13;
(ii)   qualitative evidence and the UNDP evaluation suggest that the cash payments&#13;
made to date have been valued by beneficiaries and have generally been ulsed&#13;
for constructive purposes;&#13;
(iii)  cash  payments have    lower transaction  costs than  in-kind  assistance&#13;
(essentially limited to bank transfers and payments administration);&#13;
22 Parts of the BNK (e.g., blankets, cutlery, cups) would be distributed to ex-combatants upon their arrival&#13;
in the demobilization centers so that they could make use of them during their stay in the center.&#13;
23 During the RDRP stage I, the RSA ranged from FRw300,000 for the rank of private to FRw650,0C0 for&#13;
the rank of colonel. The RSA was paid in three tranches.&#13;
24 The total reinsertion assistance for a private soldier demobilized from the RPA amounts to FRw200,000&#13;
(US$440) and compares favorably with other such programs in Africa (see attachment 6).&#13;
25 By having continued to fight against the Rwandan government, those ex-FAR who return to Rwanda&#13;
during stage II of the Program have not adhered to the spirit of the Arusha Agreement. They will, thus, not&#13;
be eligible to receive a recognition of service allowance. Members of other armed groups are not&#13;
professional soldiers and, thus, not eligible to receive benefits due to civil servants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex      19&#13;
(iv)  cash paymnents empower ex-combatants to make choices according to their&#13;
own priorities; and&#13;
(v)   they may stimulate a supply response from local producers of goods and&#13;
services, thereby contributing to an invigoration of the local economy.&#13;
77. Counseling. To encourage the appropriate use of the RSA, the Program would&#13;
provide extensive counseling on the use of the reinsertion assistance prior to&#13;
demobilization and after arrival in the community of settlement, including peer-to-peer&#13;
counseling (the sharing of experiences by ex-combatants demobilized earlier).&#13;
78. Timeframe. The RSA for the RPA would be paid in two installments of FRw50,000&#13;
and FRw100,000 respectively.26 The first installnent would be paid one month after&#13;
settlement in the community of choice, while the second installment would be paid two&#13;
months later. Payment in more than one installment would afford ex-combatants an&#13;
opportunity to improve their money management skills. The RSA for the ex-FAR would&#13;
also be paid in two installments starting one month after registration.&#13;
79. Payment modalities. Ex-combatants would become eligible for their RSA upon&#13;
registration at their relevant Provincial Program Office and after having opened a bank&#13;
account. The Provincial Program Office would request the Technical Secretariat to&#13;
transfer the funds to the individual bank accounts. Withdrawals would be effected by the&#13;
participating banks using lists provided by the Technical Secretariat, based on&#13;
presentation of the required ex-combatant ID card, and in return for RSA vouchers. Post&#13;
reviews would verify the correct execution of payments. The use of bank accounts has&#13;
several indirect benefits, including banking education for ex-combatants, rural capital&#13;
formation, and a boost for the rural banking system.&#13;
80. Safeguards. The RDRP would utilize several safeguards to ensure complete and&#13;
accurate payment of the RSA allowance: (i) tracking of RSA distribution through the&#13;
financial database as part of the MIS; (ii) registration at the Provincial Program Office;&#13;
(iii) unique photo ID card; and (iv) representative sampling of beneficiaries to verify&#13;
receipt of payment.&#13;
3.4.3 Reintegration&#13;
81. Guiding principles. Building on experiences with demobilization and reintegration&#13;
programs in Rwanda and elsewhere and on lessons leamed from community-based&#13;
development projects in the country, the second stage of the RDRP would provide&#13;
significant economic and social reintegration assistance to help ex-combatants establish&#13;
sustainable livelihoods. The following guiding principles would apply for reintegration&#13;
assistance:&#13;
(i)   ex-combatants would receive a similar amount of assistance irrespective of&#13;
their previous military affiliation;&#13;
26 Rank differentials would be paid with the second installment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex         20&#13;
(ii)  ex-combatants would receive reintegration assistance in relation to their&#13;
degree of vulnerability;&#13;
(iii) ex-combatants would be allovved to choose their reintegration destination&#13;
freely;&#13;
(iv)  assistance would seek to minimize market distortions and maximize&#13;
beneficiary choice; and&#13;
(v)   the Prograrn would seek to involve and benefit communities of settlement.&#13;
82. Reintegration Grant. RPA and armed group ex-combatants demobilized in stage HI of&#13;
the RDRP would receive a reintegration grant (RG) of FRw100,00027 six months after&#13;
their demobilization.28 Ihe RG would be provided after ex-combatants received&#13;
extensive counseling (including on business development) to help ensure that the choice&#13;
of reintegration optioll corresponds to individual circumstances and the local economic&#13;
opportunity structure. The six month delay in the provision of this support would allow&#13;
ex-combatants to gain an appreciation of civilian life and their local economic&#13;
environment and thus enable them to make more informed decisions.&#13;
83. Ex-combatants would be required to demonstrate that they intend to use the RG for&#13;
meaningful economic or social reintegration purposes (sub-projects) in order to receive&#13;
the RG. Sub-projects may include agricultural and non-farm income-generating activities&#13;
(IGAs), vocational and apprenticeship training, housing, employment, tools, and&#13;
education and scholarships as well as children's education. The RG would be paid&#13;
through the banking system according to the procedures set up for the payment of the&#13;
RSA. This arrangement would empower ex-combatants to choose the reintegration option&#13;
that best meets their needs. To lower the likelihood of abuse, the CDC would confirm the&#13;
feasibility of the sub-project in the local context and screen the proposed activity for&#13;
environmental impact.&#13;
84. Vulnerability Support Window. The Program would provide additional support to&#13;
socio-economically vulnerable ex-combatants of both stage I and stage II through a&#13;
Vulnerability Support Window (VSW). VSW assistance would be offered on a grant&#13;
basis with an average amount of assistance not exceeding FRw150,000 (US$330). Ex-&#13;
combatants would be equally eligible irrespective of rank or former military affiliation.&#13;
85. The vulnerability of individual ex-combatants would be determined on the basis of&#13;
their ability to establish a sustainable livelihood, including access to land and shelter,&#13;
health status, employment situation, and household characteristics. Detailed criteria and&#13;
procedures would be elaborated in the Program implementation manual. The CDCs and&#13;
ex-combatants associations would identify those ex-combatants who qualify for this&#13;
additional support. Medical vulnerability would be identified during the medical&#13;
screening in the demobilization centers.&#13;
27 CDCs have determined FRw1OO,000 as the maximum amount for support to an individual's income-&#13;
generating activity under the CRDP. This amount is used as reference for calculating the RG.&#13;
28 The RG under stage II would roughly correspond to the third tranche of the RSA under stage I. Evidence&#13;
suggests that many ex-combatants have used or would have liked to use, the third tranche for reintegration&#13;
purposes. This desire is taken up in the revised design of stage II.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex        21&#13;
86. Like the RG, VSW assistance would be provided in the form of sub-projects.&#13;
However, as vulnerable beneficiaries face greater obstacles to reintegration, they would&#13;
receive more extensive assistance. Procedures for the development and appraisal of VSW&#13;
sub-projects would be more robust. Two mechanisms would be used to implement VSW&#13;
sub-projects, depending on the type of sub-project selected.29 For IGAs, a decentralized&#13;
and community-based structure, consistent with the Government's policy on community&#13;
development, would be utilized. Procedures established by the MINALOC for the IDA-&#13;
financed Community Reintegration and Development Project and other donor-financed&#13;
projects would apply while also building on the experience and activities of other&#13;
interventions and implementers (e.g., Competitive and Enterprise Development Project&#13;
regarding strengthening of the Banques Populaires, etc.).&#13;
87. The following sub-project cycle has proven effective under the CRDP and similar&#13;
interventions and would be applied to the RDRP IGAs as well: (i) an ex-combatant would&#13;
prepare a sub-project proposal, with appropriate assistance by a CDC or sub-contracted&#13;
NGO/association; (ii) the respective CDC would appraise the proposal per CRDP criteria&#13;
(including an assessment of social and environmental impact); and (iii) if approved by the&#13;
CDC, funds would be transferred to the bank account of the ex-combatant. Provincial&#13;
Program Offices and CDCs would supervise sub-project implementation.&#13;
88. As and when an ex-combatant's IGA becomes profitable, he/she would contribute a&#13;
proportion of these profits to the CDC-managed Community Development Fund at the&#13;
district level, where they would be made available to other community members.&#13;
Consequently, the community would have a direct interest in the success of the ex-&#13;
combatants' sub-projects and in ensuring the ex-combatants' compliance with CRDP&#13;
procedures. In this context, the creation of mixed groups of ex-combatants and other&#13;
community members as well as the integration of ex-combatants into existing&#13;
community-based IGAs would be encouraged. Mixed groups would enable community&#13;
members to benefit directly from the financial resources available to ex-combatants;&#13;
while the ex-combatants could learn from the professional experience of civilians.&#13;
89. For all other VSW sub-projects (e.g., vocational training, formal education,&#13;
apprenticeships), the Technical Secretariat would enter into a contract with implementing&#13;
partners. This contract would stipulate the responsibilities of the implementers regarding&#13;
the provision of economic reintegration assistance to ex-combatants, including the&#13;
expected result of the sub-project and its duration and cost. The Provincial Program&#13;
Offices would undertake regular monitoring on a representative basis to verify service&#13;
delivery to Program beneficiaries.&#13;
90. Geographic reintegration patterns. During the first stage of the RDRP, ex-&#13;
combatants settled mainly in their communities of origin, in communities where they&#13;
have relatives or in communities where they had been stationed. Less than one-quarter of&#13;
ex-combatants settled in urban areas. It is likely that the majority of ex-combatants to be&#13;
29 For vulnerable ex-combatants demobilized during stage II, the reintegration grant could be provided&#13;
together with support to a sub-project under the VSW. In this case, VSW procedures would apply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex      22&#13;
demobilized in the second stage would settle in rural areas. Therefore, access to land&#13;
becomes a critical elernent for successful economic integration.&#13;
91. Access to land. Ex-combatants' access to land would be facilitated with the same&#13;
community-based procedures used for others who need land. Specifically, any Rwandese&#13;
in search of land for housing or agricultural production would normally contact his/her&#13;
local administration, which would allot an available piece of public land for use if&#13;
possible. In the event that no public land were available, the local administration would&#13;
consult with relevant community members to determine whether they would agree to&#13;
cede part of their land to the newcomer(s) on a voluntary basis.30 No citizen would be&#13;
compelled to cede any of his/her land. There would thus be no involuntary displacement&#13;
of civilians as a result of ex-combatants settling in a community.&#13;
92. Social reintegration. The objective of social reintegration assistance would be to&#13;
promote reconciliation between ex-combatants and civilians in communities of&#13;
settlement. Social reintegration may be especially difficult in the context of Rwanda, as&#13;
many ex-combatants lost their families during the genocide and/or came from&#13;
neighboring countries and have no 'home' to which they can return, while others have&#13;
committed acts of violence in their commtnities. The participation of communities in the&#13;
RDRP is therefore considered critical for successful reintegration.&#13;
93. Specific activities to be carried out under this component would include:&#13;
(i)   assessments of community perceptions of ex-combatants and ex-combatants'&#13;
perceptions of communities;&#13;
(ii)  expansion of current national and community reconciliation activities;&#13;
(iii) information and sensitization of ex-combatants and communities through&#13;
outreach activities, including training of counselors and sensitization efforts&#13;
(national awareness campaign, presentation of the RDRP, discussion of ex-&#13;
combatants and community rights and obligations, regular field visits by&#13;
Program staff for sensitization and problem solving, etc.); and&#13;
(iv)  specialized counseling (e.g., family, HIV/AIDS, and women).&#13;
3.4.4 Special target groups&#13;
94. Gender. On the basis of demobilization patterns to date (111 female ex-combatants&#13;
were demobilized during stage I of the RDRP), it appears unlikely that the number of&#13;
female ex-combatants to be demobilized during the second stage would be sizeable.&#13;
However, given experiences of other demobilization and reintegration programs, the&#13;
RDRP would provide targeted support for the social and economic reintegration of&#13;
female ex-combatants.&#13;
30 The Program would not bear the costs of land acquisition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex         23&#13;
95. Specific measures would include the following:&#13;
(i)   Ensuring that the special needs (e.g., security, sanitation) of female ex-&#13;
combatants are taken into account in the demobilization centers;&#13;
(ii)  ensuring that all benefits for ex-combatants are equal for and equally&#13;
accessible to men and women;&#13;
(iii)  encouraging implementing partners to ensure that their reintegration support&#13;
activities within the VSW facilitate the participation of female ex-combatants;&#13;
(iv)  encouraging female ex-combatants to participate in existing women's&#13;
associations;&#13;
(v)   including partners of ex-combatants and women in communities of return in&#13;
community-level counseling activities;&#13;
(vi)  strengthening the gender awareness and capacity of RDRC staff and of those&#13;
CDCs and Politico-Administrative Committees (CPAs) to which a significant&#13;
number of female ex-combatants will return; and&#13;
(vii)  monitoring the impact of the Program on partners of ex-combatants and&#13;
women in communities of return and bringing emerging problems to the&#13;
attention of the relevant authorities.&#13;
96. Disabled ex-combatants.3' Only limited medical and economic assistance has been&#13;
provided to disabled ex-combatants to date. The second stage of the RDRP would seek to&#13;
systematically address the medical and economic rehabilitation needs of the estimated&#13;
2,400 disabled ex-combatants (to be) demobilized under stages I and II (550 and 1,850,&#13;
respectively) of the Program. The degree of disability would be defined by a medical&#13;
commission.&#13;
97. With respect to medical rehabilitation, the Program would provide assistance&#13;
depending on the degree of disability. Furthermore, it would seek to reinforce key&#13;
medical facilities to provide systematic prosthetic and physiotherapy services, including&#13;
maintenance of prosthetic devices, to ex-combatants. In cases where ex-combatants are&#13;
too severely disabled to pursue economic activities themselves, the Program would&#13;
support the deferral of Program benefits to a family member identified by the ex-&#13;
combatant.&#13;
98. Chronically ill ex-combatants. The second stage of the RDRP would also seek to&#13;
systematically address the medical needs of chronically ill ex-combatants. A medical&#13;
commission would determine the degree of illness. The Program would endeavor to&#13;
ensure access to medical care and counseling for chronically ill ex-combatants for up to&#13;
12 months after demobilization. After this period, the Program would transfer&#13;
responsibility for these ex-combatants to relevant health authorities. In cases where ex-&#13;
combatants are too ill to pursue economic activities themselves, the Program would&#13;
31 Disability is defined as the functional limitation within an individual caused by physical, mental or&#13;
sensory impairment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex        24&#13;
support the deferral of Program benefits to a family member identified by the ex-&#13;
combatant.&#13;
99. Child ex-combatants. The RPA demobilized 2,364 child soldiers in 1995 and&#13;
transferred them to a special primary school (kadogo school) in Butare. 32 The school was&#13;
closed in 1998. In early 1999, the RDRC reported that almost three-quarters of child ex-&#13;
combatants had been reunited with their parent(s), while the remaining one-quarte;r was&#13;
alone or with friends or relatives. The further reintegration of child ex-combatants&#13;
demobilized under the first stage of the RDRP has not been monitored systematically. If&#13;
still economically vulnerable, they would be eligible to receive reintegration assistance&#13;
under the VSW.&#13;
100. While no further child soldiers would need to be demobilized from the RPA, it is&#13;
assumed that approximately 2,500 child soldiers would be demobilized from among the&#13;
armed groups. They would thus likely represent a significant target group for the second&#13;
stage of the RDRP. Child ex-combatants would be identified during the verification&#13;
screening in the demobilization center and separated from adult ex-combatants as soon as&#13;
possible. They would undergo specialized counseling in a separate site.&#13;
101. Assistance to the reintegration of child ex-combatants would include family tracing&#13;
and unification, trauma counseling and psycho-social care, and facilitation of access to&#13;
education and recreation in communities of settlement. Children older than 15 years may&#13;
have different needs and would receive appropriate support (e.g., for vocational training).&#13;
Under the overall coordination of the RDRC, MINALOC would be responsible for&#13;
implementation in collaboration with experienced partners such as UNICEF. In response&#13;
to the recent return of 262 child combatants from the DRC. MINALOC and UNICEF&#13;
have begun to prepare a targeted program of assistance.&#13;
3.4.5 HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation measures&#13;
102. The second stage of the RDRP would contain an HIV/AIDS component to provide&#13;
HIV/AIDS sensitization and VCT to ex-combatants during demobilization as well as&#13;
follow-up in communities in which ex-combatants settle. The RDRP would coordinate&#13;
closely with the existing national AIDS program to take over counseling and treatment of&#13;
ex-combatants and their families in communities of settlement.&#13;
103. Demobilization phtase. The following activities would be conducted for all ex-&#13;
combatants during the demobilization process: (i) initial sensitization; (ii) pre-test&#13;
counseling; (iii) voluntary testing (every effort would be made to have facilities available&#13;
to run the confirmatory test in the field for ex-combatants who test positive on the first&#13;
screening test); and (iv) post-test counseling. Ex-combatants who test negative would be&#13;
given an individual counseling session in which they would be informed of their sero-&#13;
status and receive the standard Information, Education and Communication (IEC)&#13;
32 The figure of 2,364 was established as the official number of demobilized child soldiers. However, only&#13;
725 had actually been registered in the RPA. The others had merely been under the protection of the RPA&#13;
and possibly provided logistical and other assistance (cf. UNDP evaluation).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex         25&#13;
material and condom package. Ex-combatants who test positive would have confirmatory&#13;
testing, receive intensive post-test counseling, be given condoms, and be referred to a&#13;
local hospital for management and support regarding potential opportunistic infections.&#13;
The sensitization and VCT during the demobilization process would be sub-contracted to&#13;
specialized agencies as appropriate.&#13;
104. Reintegration phase. In collaboration with activities envisaged under the national&#13;
AIDS program, the following activities would be considered in the reintegration phase:&#13;
(i) encouraging HIV-positive ex-combatants to join existing support groups of people&#13;
living with HIV/AIDS; (ii) utilizing ex-combatant networks to disseminate HIV/AIDS&#13;
sensitization in communities of settlement; (iii) providing additional assistance to the&#13;
families of ex-combatants who are unable to resume economic activities due to&#13;
HIV/AIDS, including delegation of economic assistance to a family member or financing&#13;
access to education of an ex-combatant's children; and (iv) training ex-combatants to&#13;
serve as HIV/AIDS counselors.&#13;
3.5  Program Cost&#13;
105. The second stage of the Government's Program is estimated to cost US$53.3&#13;
million (see table 1), of which IDA would finance US$25.0 million. Other donors would&#13;
be expected to finance about US$25.6 million (see table 2). Total Program costs of stages&#13;
I and II amount to US$72.7 million, or US$852 per beneficiary (see attachment 3).&#13;

106.  Government counterpart contribution. Already having contributed US$9.8&#13;
million to the first stage of the RDRP, and notwithstanding its fiscal constraints, the&#13;
Government is committed to supporting the second stage of the Program. Overall, the&#13;
Government's contribution would amount to 5 percent of stage II Program costs (see&#13;
table 2). Furthermore, the Government would finance all taxes levied in Rwanda on&#13;
works, goods and services for this Program.&#13;

3.6  Conditions of Effectiveness&#13;
107. The following conditions of effectiverness have been agreed upon with Government:&#13;
(i)    a decree has been adopted, in form   and substance satisfactory to the&#13;
Association, establishing the Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration&#13;
Commission, supported by the Technical Secretariat and Provincial Program&#13;
Offices;&#13;
(ii)   a regulation has been adopted, in form and substance satisfactory to the&#13;
Association, establishing the eligibility criteria for the demobilization and&#13;
reintegration of ex-combatants;&#13;
(iii)  key professional staff have been appointed at the Technical Secretariat, with&#13;
qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Association;&#13;
(iv)   a financial management and accounting system     has been established,&#13;
acceptable to the Association;&#13;
(v)   the Program implementation manual has been adopted in form and substance&#13;
satisfactory to the Association;&#13;
(vi)  the Demobilization and Reintegration Fund Account (DRFA) has been&#13;
established; and&#13;
(vii)  the initial deposit to the DRFA of US$1.1 million has been made.&#13;
4 Studies and Technical Assistance&#13;
108. The evaluation of the first stage of the RDRP identified information gaps as well as&#13;
Program areas in need of improvement. Institutional development support would,&#13;
therefore, be provided in the form of studies and technical assistance to inform the&#13;
implementation of stage II of the Program. The Bank would provide technical support as&#13;
required.&#13;
3 Donors who have indicated their firm commitment to co-finance the RDRP include Canada, Gerinany,&#13;
the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Belgium and Switzerland has also expressed interest in&#13;
supporting the RDRP. Pledges received for the MDTF are sufficient to cover the financing gap.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex       27&#13;
4.1 Studies&#13;
109. Economic opportunity structure. The objective of this activity would be to assess&#13;
opportunities that ex-combatants will find upon their reintegration into civilian life. The&#13;
study would focus on employment, the informal sector and vocational training (including&#13;
informal apprenticeships) in the rural and urban sectors. The findings would be collated&#13;
in the form of an inventory of reintegration opportunities by province and sector. This&#13;
inventory would be used by the Provincial Program Offices for informing and counseling&#13;
ex-combatants.&#13;
110. Beneficiary assessment of ex-combatants demobilized in stage I. A beneficiary&#13;
assessment would help identify the reintegration experiences of ex-combatants from the&#13;
RPA and members of armed groups, disaggregated by gender and level of disability. A&#13;
qualitative survey would be carried out, using participant observation and key informant&#13;
and focal group interviews with ex-combatants, their family members, and other&#13;
members of the communities of settlement. The results of this study would help fine-tune&#13;
support for economic and social reintegration.&#13;
111. Pre-demobilization orientation program. A program would be developed to provide&#13;
ex-combatants with information about the Program, health issues and civilian life. In&#13;
particular, ex-combatants would be briefed about their benefits and the modalities to&#13;
access them, banking and financial matters, civic and community duties, training and&#13;
employment opportunities, access to land and credit, income generating activities, and&#13;
family and health issues.&#13;
112. Program of community sensitization and participation. The objective of this&#13;
program would be to sensitize the civilian population about the RDRP and the challenges&#13;
faced during this process by ex-combatants and their families. The program would also&#13;
address the concerns of the receiving communities and to encourage their participation in&#13;
reintegration activities. The program would be disseminated on various forms of media&#13;
(e.g., radio, brochures, popular folk theater, and newspapers).&#13;
113. Assistance for disabled ex-combatants. This study would help design and cost the&#13;
detailed assistance package that would: (i) provide counseling necessary for the social&#13;
reintegration of disabled ex-combatants; (ii) medically rehabilitate disabled ex-&#13;
combatants in order to achieve optimal and sustainable benefits from therapeutic&#13;
interventions such as the provision of prostheses and physiotherapy; and (iii) where&#13;
relevant, train disabled ex-combatants in skills needed to pursue an economic activity&#13;
which is both of their choice and economically viable. The assistance would encourage&#13;
the development of community-based rather than institution-based services, and would&#13;
further initiatives which increase the capacity of disabled people to help themselves and&#13;
each other.&#13;
4.2 Technical Assistance&#13;
114. Local and/or expatriate technical assistance may be required for longer-term and&#13;
short-term assignments during Program implementation. Consultancies would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex        28&#13;
required on an ongoing basis, especially for periodic external audits and independent&#13;
evaluations. Qualified (private and/or public) providers would be sub-contracted by the&#13;
Technical Secretariat to undertake such activities. Targeted technical assistance may also&#13;
be needed for HIV/AIDS activities and the special target groups component (child. ex-&#13;
combatants, disabled ex-combatants). The Technical Secretariat could sub-contract&#13;
activities in part or as a whole to qualified implementers. For training and employment&#13;
opportunities, the Technical Secretariat would prepare a roster of qualified&#13;
organizations/employers by province.&#13;
5 Institutional Arrangements and Program Implementation&#13;
5.1  Institutional Structure&#13;
115. The Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Commission, which was created in&#13;
1997, would be legally established before Credit effectiveness. The RDRC is mandated to&#13;
design and implement the RDRP. It would be abolished upon completion of its work&#13;
program.&#13;
116. Several related problems were encountered during the implementation of the first&#13;
stage of the Program. In particular, a lack of clarity about the division of labor and&#13;
responsibilities between the policy and technical levels was apparent. The&#13;
Commissioners were regularly engaged in technical issues while the Techmical&#13;
Secretariat was understaffed. A lack of financial resources limited the Program's ability&#13;
to strengthen its technical capacity.&#13;
117. The recent UNDP evaluation of stage I contains a number of proposals to improve&#13;
the institutional arrangements, including decentralized Program implementation, a focus&#13;
on staff development, and outsourcing of work. The institutional arrangements for stage&#13;
II would build on these lessons. There would be a clear division of labor between the&#13;
Commissioners and the Technical Secretariat. Furthermore, the RDRC would largely&#13;
transfer responsibility for the implementation of reintegration activities to excisting&#13;
Government and commumity structures.&#13;
5.1.1 Central level&#13;
118. Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Commission. The Commission would be&#13;
the Government's supervisory body of the RDRP.3 Its main responsibilities would&#13;
include:&#13;
(i)   Advising the Government on matters concerning the demobilization and&#13;
reintegration of ex-combatants;&#13;
(ii)  identifying and resolving substantive policy problems related to the&#13;
reintegration of ex-combatants into civilian life;&#13;
34 The costs associated with the Commission would be borne by the Govermment of Rwanda.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex      29&#13;
(iii)  monitoring and guiding the work of the Technical Secretariat and other&#13;
Government and non-governmental institutions and agencies involved in&#13;
Program implementation; and&#13;
(iv)  carrying out other activities as necessary to ensure the achievement of&#13;
Program objectives.&#13;
119. Technical Secretariat. The Technical Secretariat would serve as the Program's&#13;
implementation unit. In particular, the Technical Secretariat would be charged with:&#13;
(i)   the preparation and costing of detailed annual implementation plans;&#13;
(ii)  the implementation and coordination of the individual RDRP components&#13;
(demobilization, reinsertion, reintegration, special target groups, HIV/AIDS&#13;
measures). To this end, the Technical Secretariat would establish close links&#13;
with relevant Government departments, local organizations and associations,&#13;
the private sector, and donor and UN partners;&#13;
(iii)  the transparent and accountable administration of Program  resources&#13;
(including procurement and financial management); and&#13;
(iv)  monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
120. The Technical Secretariat would be headed by a Program Coordinator and comprise&#13;
three departments (see attachment 7 for organigrarn):&#13;
(i)   administration and finance (including personnel, procurement and financial&#13;
management);&#13;
(ii)  operations (including demobilization, reintegration and special groups); and&#13;
(iii)  information management (including monitoring and evaluation).&#13;
121. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN) would be the&#13;
parent ministry for the RDRP. The Ministry of Defense (MINADEF) would provide&#13;
logistical assistance in the demobilization phase. The MINALOC would be responsible&#13;
for the coordination of efforts in support of the reintegration of child ex-combatants.&#13;
Furthermore, the MINALOC would play a central role in building CDC and CPA&#13;
capacities in districts with weak local institutions. The NURC would be responsible for&#13;
the development of reconciliation measures in the demobilization centers.&#13;
5.1.2 Provincial level&#13;
122. The Government adopted a decentralization policy in 2001 which transferred&#13;
authority over local development to 106 district administrations. As ex-combatants are&#13;
likely to settle in all of the country's districts, the Technical Secretariat could not hope to&#13;
properly oversee implementation from one central point. At the same time, the Technical&#13;
Secretariat could not establish a presence in all districts. Therefore, the RDRC would&#13;
establish a decentralized presence at the provincial level (12 provinces) to help administer&#13;
reinsertion and reintegration assistance. In provinces in which more than 1,000 ex-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex        30&#13;
combatants settle, a fully fledged Provincial Program Office would be established. In&#13;
those with fewer than 1,000 ex-combatants, an assistant program officer would be&#13;
attached to the local administration.&#13;
123. The provincial authorities would be aided to expand their capacity, and he&#13;
Technical Secretariat would base a Provincial Programn Office within each provincial&#13;
administration.35 The T'echnical Secretariat would recruit staff of the Provincial Program&#13;
Offices in consultation with the respective Prefects. Staff would report to both the Prefect&#13;
and the Technical Secretariat. This approach would help strengthen decentralized&#13;
Program delivery capacity and ensure the integration of Program implementation in the&#13;
Government's poverty reduiction strategy.&#13;
124. The RDRP Provincial Program Offices would be responsible for the following:&#13;
(i)   updating the inventory of projects and training and employment providers;&#13;
(ii)  conducting outreach activities, including counseling and referral as well as&#13;
business development support;&#13;
(iii)  technical and financial monitoring of reintegration activities, especially at the&#13;
community level; and&#13;
(iv) coordinating with other Government and non-governmental institutions,&#13;
CDCs, and CPAs.&#13;
5.1.3 Community level&#13;
125. Community Development Committees and CPAs were formally established&#13;
throughout Rwanda in 1999 as the development and administration arm of the local&#13;
government, respectively. 6 These elected bodies seek to empower communities in the&#13;
reconstruction and development process and to foster reconciliation by providing clear&#13;
benefits for community-level cooperation. Many CDCs have gained significant technical&#13;
experience in the implementation of the CRDP and other projects under the MINALOC.&#13;
126. As community support is critical to the reintegration of ex-combatants, CDCs and&#13;
CPAs at the cell, sector and district level would have an important role to play in the&#13;
social and economic reintegration of ex-combatants. The relationship between CDCs and&#13;
CPAs and their respective provincial administration, as well as to central government,&#13;
would be governed by the Government's decentralization policy. CDCs and CPAs would:&#13;
(i)   oversee the IGA sub-component according to procedures established by the&#13;
MINALOC and the RDRC;&#13;
3 The four existing Veterans Field Offices would be integrated into the respective Provincial Program&#13;
Office.&#13;
36 The CDC and CPA together form the Executive Committee at the cell, sector, and district level. With the&#13;
decentralization decree of March 2001, all members of the Executive Committee are elected by the&#13;
population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex           31&#13;
(ii)   help in the provision of land to ex-combatants following established&#13;
procedures;&#13;
(iii)  help identify the most vulnerable ex-combatants; and&#13;
(iv)  help resolve local conflicts.&#13;
127. With respect to the IGA sub-component in the VSW, and building on current&#13;
procedures, CDCs would focus mainly on:&#13;
(i)   counseling;&#13;
(ii)  assisting in the preparation of sub-project proposals;&#13;
(iii)  appraising and approving proposals; and&#13;
(iv)  monitoring progress and eventual contributions&#13;
128. In districts where CDCs are currently weak, technical activities (with the exception&#13;
of sub-project appraisal and approval) could be sub-contracted to qualified&#13;
NGOs/associations until the capacities of the CDCs have been sufficiently strengthened.&#13;
Partner agencies37 (Banques Populaires, qualified NGOs, etc.) would assist the CDCs in&#13;
managing the funds, undertaking all requisite accounting and disbursement procedures,&#13;
and effecting payments to beneficiaries as well as collecting eventual contributions.&#13;
129. The Technical Secretariat would coordinate with the MINALOC in order to identify&#13;
any additional costs arising out of the implementation of the Program through CDC/CPA&#13;
structures and reimbursing them accordingly.&#13;
5.1.4 Staffing, institutional support and capacity building&#13;
130. The institutional structure for Program implementation requires strengthening at all&#13;
levels (Technical Secretariat, Provincial Program Offices, and CDCs/CPAs). The&#13;
Technical Secretariat would be strengthened through the appointment of a Program&#13;
Coordinator (head of the Technical Secretariat) and three department heads: (i) Chief&#13;
Financial Officer; (ii) Chief Operations Officer; and (iii) Chief Information Officer. Staff&#13;
recruited for these key positions should have experience and qualifications satisfactory to&#13;
IDA. Provincial staff would be recruited in accordance with the settlement patterns of ex-&#13;
combatants. All positions could be filled by qualified ex-combatants.&#13;
131. Equipment would be provided to help each office fulfill its responsibilities&#13;
effectively. For the Technical Secretariat, this would include vehicles and office&#13;
equipment. Each Provincial Program Office would receive essential office equipment as&#13;
well as motorcycles for monitoring and outreach activities. CDCs/CPAs would in&#13;
principle be eligible to receive limited institutional support after having undergone&#13;
training activities. They would be required to submit a proposal to the Provincial Program&#13;
37 Partner agencies include nongovernmental organizations or other public or private entities. They would&#13;
be identified by the Technical Secretariat on the basis of technical criteria and financial and administrative&#13;
capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex        32&#13;
Office explaining and specifying their requirements in detail. The Technical Secretariat&#13;
would approve the proposals upon recommendation by the Provincial Program Officer.&#13;
132. Staff development at the central and provincial levels would be critical for effective&#13;
Program implemenlation. Staff at all levels would therefore undergo training. The&#13;
objectives of this training, which would commence immediately after staff have been&#13;
recruited/assigned, wvould be to ensure that all involved in the RDRP have the sarne&#13;
understanding of the P'rogram objectives, procedures, and specific responsibilities,&#13;
including their tasks in relation to the internal reporting system. A staff development&#13;
program would be prepared and would include: (i) the preparation of a training plan; (ii)&#13;
the development of training materials; and (iii) the carrying out of training activitiecs,&#13;
including gender awareness and sensitization.&#13;
133. Special capacity-building efforts and training may be required at the community&#13;
level, especially for those CDCs and CPAs that are not yet benefiting from development&#13;
projects. After an assessment of their implementation needs, and using the Program&#13;
implementation manual and the training manual developed by the MINALOC, key&#13;
members of CDCs and CPAs would be familiarized with Program procedures and would&#13;
receive required training. As necessary, relevant CDC members and partner agencies&#13;
would also undergo training for supervising the IGA sub-component of the RDRP.&#13;
Finally, outreach staff would undertake "on the job" training of CDC and CPA members.&#13;
5.2  Financial Management and Auditing&#13;
134. The Program implementation manual would describe procedures for the entire&#13;
Program, irrespective of the source of financing. The manual would notably include the&#13;
procedures for reintegration activities which would be based on the Bank's Guidelines for&#13;
Simplified Procurement and Disbursement for Community-Based Investments.&#13;
5.2.1 Financing mechanisms&#13;
135. There would be four distinct financing mechanisms to manage Program funds: (i) a&#13;
quick disbursing mechanism for Category (1) of the IDA Credit; (ii) a Special Account&#13;
for Categories (2) to (5) of the IDA Credit; (iii) the Government's contribution inclusive&#13;
of donor support through the budget; and (iv) a Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) for&#13;
donor contributions.38&#13;
136. Quick disbursing mechanism. The rapid implementation of the Program requires a&#13;
substantial amount of primarily local currency at specific points in time. The Program&#13;
addresses this exigency by incorporating the provision of foreign exchange for UJS$18&#13;
million through a quick disbursing mechanism. This mechanism would consist of&#13;
reimbursement to the Government of the foreign currency used for private sector imports&#13;
for eligible goods included in a pre-approved positive list of imports.&#13;
3S In addition, some donors may prefer bilateral financing to the Commission or directly to implementing&#13;
agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex           33&#13;
137. Procurement and disbursement would follow the Bank's simplified procedures for&#13;
adjustment operations. The proceeds of the quick disbursing component would be&#13;
disbursed twice a year in roughly equal installments following the sequence of the&#13;
demobilization plan agreed upon with the Government. The Credit would finance 100&#13;
percent of eligible imports from the private sector for contracts between US$5,000 and&#13;
US$2 million against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) prepared by the Banque&#13;
Nationale du Rwanda (BNR).39 Supporting documentation would include the invoice or&#13;
any written documents from the supplier establishing the price of the product, the pre-&#13;
shipment certificate, a proof of payment, and the customs bill of entry establishing that&#13;
the product has entered the country of the Borrower. The supporting documents would be&#13;
kept in the BNR.&#13;
138. The Borrower would open a Deposit Account for Category 1 in US dollars in the&#13;
BNR. Upon Credit effectiveness and at request of the Borrower, proceeds of the first&#13;
installment would be deposited in the account against SOE as above indicated. The&#13;
remaining installments would be released if the Program is being implemented in a&#13;
manner satisfactory to the Association and on the basis of:&#13;
(i)   an implementation plan and resource requirements for the subsequent 6 month&#13;
period; and&#13;
(ii)  a list of ex-combatants, identifying the amount of the funds allocated to each&#13;
in support of their reinsertion and reintegration.40&#13;
139. Upon receipt of the proceeds of the Credit through the release of each installment,&#13;
the BNR would convert the foreign currency into Rwandese Francs and deposit these in a&#13;
Demobilization and Reintegration Fund Account (DRFA) opened by the Government for&#13;
this purpose. The Government would ensure that all such funds would be used&#13;
exclusively to make payments for the demobilization, reinsertion and reintegration of ex-&#13;
combatants under the RDRP.&#13;
140. A positive list of imports has been established that is linked to the emergency at&#13;
different levels: (i) the rehabilitation of infrastructure and equipment destroyed by or&#13;
dilapidated during the war; (ii) the (re-) construction of houses for war-affected&#13;
populations; and (iii) the Program proper, in particular the reintegration component&#13;
(agriculture, training, etc.) but also demobilization (transport, rehabilitation, etc.). The&#13;
positive list is made up of products imported by the private sector as commercial&#13;
practices of the private sector in Rwanda have been found acceptable to IDA during&#13;
earlier operations of the same nature. To avoid ambiguities on whether or not a product&#13;
belongs to the list of eligible imports, the list is linked to sections of the Rwandan&#13;
customs code classifications. The positive list of imports is provided in attachment 8.&#13;
39 The minimum amount was reduced from US$10,000 on basis of the experience of the last operation of&#13;
this nature executed in Rwanda. It should be noted that the average value of import contracts CIF is less&#13;
than US$30,000.&#13;
40 In case of unsatisfactory Program performance, the pending installment of Category (1) could be delayed&#13;
until the Program is back on track. Disbursements from the Multi-Donor Trust Fund could then be handled&#13;
such that sufficient resources are available to provide reinsertion and reintegration assistance to those&#13;
already demobilized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization clnd Reintegration Program - Technical Annex       34&#13;
141. Retroactive financin,g. To facilitate speedy support to ex-combatants demobilized as&#13;
of December 2001, and to those to be demobilized early in 2002, the Project would allow&#13;
retroactive financing in the amount of US$3.6 million. This would apply to eligible&#13;
imports for which payment were made after October 30, 2001. Retroactive financing&#13;
would allow the Government to provide to approximately 7,000 ex-combatants41, the full&#13;
range of demobilization support and reinsertion benefits foreseen in the Program, through&#13;
the counterpart funds generated by this part of the Credit.&#13;
142. Special Account. To facilitate the implementation of activities of categories (2) to&#13;
(5), the Program would have a standard S;pecial Account at the BNR with an authorized&#13;
allocation of US$800,000. This Special Account would be managed by the Technical&#13;
Secretariat and would finance: (i) the procurement of goods and limited works: (ii)&#13;
consultant services; and (iii) operating expenses. Expenditures under the quick disbursing&#13;
mechanism would not be eligible for financing under the Special Account.&#13;
143. Use of Statement of Expenditures. For contracts eligible for financing under&#13;
Categories 2 to 5 of the Credit, all expenditures would be made against full&#13;
documentation, except for items of expenditures under: (i) contracts for goods and works&#13;
costing less than the equivalent of US$100,000, (ii) contracts for consulting firms costing&#13;
less than the equivalent of US$50,000; and (iii) contracts for individual consultants&#13;
costing less than the equivalent of US$25,000, which would be claimed on the basis of&#13;
SOEs. All supporting documentation for SOEs would be retained at the Technical&#13;
Secretariat.&#13;
144. Multi-donor trustfuntd. The Government recognizes that a trust fund for the RDRP&#13;
would ensure a comprehensive response to the Program, facilitate the involvement of&#13;
donors that might otherwise not be able to participate, minimize duplication of efforts,&#13;
and reduce the administrative burden on Government through the application of one set&#13;
of implementation procedures. For those donors not wishing to channel funds to the&#13;
Program through budget support, the Government requested the Bank to establish and&#13;
administer a Multi-Donor Trust Fund.&#13;
145. The Government and the Bank have agreed that donors can state their preference for&#13;
financing the RDRP within the Bank's broader MDTF. Several donors have indicated&#13;
their interest in contributing to such a financial mechanism. Disbursements under the&#13;
Multi-Donor Trust Fund, for which a separate account would be set up, would be in tlhose&#13;
categories not covered, or not completely covered, by IDA or through the Government's&#13;
contribution. This includes in particular reinsertion and reintegration benefits, support to&#13;
special groups, and technical assistance.&#13;
41 This includes the 1,735 members of armed groups demobilized in December 2001 and approximately&#13;
5,000 RPA soldiers to be demobilized before Credit effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex        35&#13;
5.2.2 Accounting and auditing arrangements&#13;
146. For the sake of comprehensiveness and harmonization of procedures, Program funds&#13;
would be administered and audited irrespective of their source and the financing&#13;
mechanism employed.&#13;
147. During stage I of the RDRP, the RDRC has managed resources from both the&#13;
Government and donors (through a UNDP-administered trust fund). Financial&#13;
management systems have been simple but adequate. The financial statements of the&#13;
funds from the UJNDP trust fund have been audited periodically by an international audit&#13;
firm without any significant qualifications. However, for the increased level of operations&#13;
under the second stage of the RDRP, the staff and systems would be strengthened as&#13;
follows.&#13;
148. The Technical Secretariat would include an Administration and Finance&#13;
Department. An experienced Chief Financial Officer and an accountant with&#13;
qualifications acceptable to IDA have already been recruited. The following additional&#13;
measures would be undertaken to ensure adequate management of Program funds in&#13;
accordance with IDA requirements: (i) manual offinancial procedures: The Technical&#13;
Secretariat would prepare a manual of accounting and internal control procedures. It is&#13;
expected that a satisfactory manual would be adopted and approved by the RDRC before&#13;
Credit effectiveness; (ii) accounting software: The Technical Secretariat would install a&#13;
software designed for Program accounting that is capable of generating periodic reports.&#13;
149. Accounting. The Technical Secretariat would maintain records and accounts to&#13;
reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the operations, resources, and&#13;
expenditures of the RDRP. Toward this end, it would set up and maintain an accounting,&#13;
budgetary, and financial management system adequate to provide complete, accurate,&#13;
timely and relevant information regarding RDRP activities, the utilization of resources,&#13;
and the completeness of expenditures.&#13;
150. Financial Monitoring Reports. The Technical Secretariat would produce quarterly&#13;
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) for all expenditures under the Program,&#13;
commencing the end of the first full quarter following Credit effectiveness. The FMRs&#13;
would include (i) a financial report; (ii) a report on implementation progress; and (iii) a&#13;
report on procurement activities. The reports would emphasize the linkage between&#13;
expenditures and physical progress as an important aspect of overall Program monitoring.&#13;
The FMRs would be flexible and customized to reflect the needs of the Program while&#13;
still meeting Bank's information requirements for financial monitoring reporting.&#13;
151. Auditing. The records, accounts and financial statements for expenditures, including&#13;
for all Categories of the IDA Credit, including the Deposit Account, the DRFA and the&#13;
Special Account, would be audited in accordance with international auditing standards.42&#13;
These audits would be conducted by external auditors acceptable to IDA under terms of&#13;
reference agreed upon with IDA. As additional assurance considered necessary for this&#13;
42 Audits of expenditures under Category I of the IDA Credit would be undertaken on the basis of&#13;
documentation maintained at the BNR (see paragraph 137).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization andl Reintegration Program - Technical Annex      36&#13;
operation, financial statements of the Program would be audited every six months for the&#13;
first year. If performance proves to be satisfactory, audits would be undertaken annually&#13;
thereafter. The date of the first audit would be decided in consultation with IDA. The&#13;
audit reports along with Management Letters providing comments and observations, and&#13;
making relevant and. practical recommendations for improvements in financial&#13;
management would be sent to IDA and all other financing partners not later than four&#13;
months after the end of each preceding period.&#13;
152. Supervision. On a semi-annual basis or at such time that the Government and the&#13;
Bank deem necessary, the Government and IDA would carry out joint supervision&#13;
missions. These missions would make spot checks on a small random sample of&#13;
beneficiaries at their place of residence to verify the use of the funds disbursed.&#13;
153. Safeguards to ensure dhe proper use of,funds. Six safeguards have been built into the&#13;
Program to ensure that IDA funds are utilized for the purposes intended:&#13;
*  Replenishments under the quick-disbursing mechanism (Category (1)) would be&#13;
linked to Program performance (paragraph 138);&#13;
*  Periodic audits would verify appropriate use of funds under all Categories;&#13;
&#149;  A unique, non-transferable, photograph ID would be provided to each ex-cornbatant.&#13;
This would be used to verify ex-combatants' eligibility for assistance;&#13;
*  The IDs would be entered in an integrated MIS that would enable the Technical&#13;
Secretariat and Provincial Program Offices to track Program implementation at the&#13;
central and local level;&#13;
*  Annual surveys of a random sample of the beneficiary population would track&#13;
Program delivery and verify their receipt of assistance; and&#13;
o  Semi-annual supervision missions would be carried out by IDA in collaboration with&#13;
interested UN/donor partners.&#13;
154. Overall assessment. A Bank accredited Financial Management Specialist has&#13;
reviewed the present status and the agreed actions indicated above (paragraph 148). On&#13;
this basis, IDA has reasonable assurances for an adequate financial management of&#13;
Program funds in conformity with current IDA requirements. But, while all necessary up-&#13;
front measures have been taken, financial management of the RDRP would require close&#13;
follow up. To this end, specialized Bank staff at headquarters and in the field office&#13;
would monitor financial performance on an ongoing basis.&#13;
5.3  Procurement&#13;
155. Procurement of goods and works to be financed from the proceeds of the Credit&#13;
would be governed by the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and ID,4&#13;
Credits published in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996, September&#13;
1997 and January 1999. Consultant services contracts financed by IDA would be&#13;
procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Selection of Consultants by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex      37&#13;
World Bank Borrowers published in January 1997 and revised in September 1997 and&#13;
January 1999.&#13;
156. In addition to the eligible private sector imports financed through the quick&#13;
disbursement component as described in paragraphs 136-141, the Credit would finance&#13;
goods required for the demobilization process, including basic needs kits, equipment to&#13;
prepare ID cards and VCT materials. The Credit would also finance office equipment and&#13;
vehicles/motorcycles for the Technical Secretariat and the Provincial Program Offices.&#13;
Furthermore, the Credit would finance the rehabilitation of, and the purchase of essential&#13;
equipment for, two demobilization centers and up to two medical rehabilitation centers.&#13;
5.3.1 Procurement capacity assessment&#13;
157. A procurement capacity assessment of the agencies involved in Program execution&#13;
was carried out during appraisal. The procurement activities would be handled by two&#13;
agencies, the Technical Secretariat and the National Tender Board. The Technical&#13;
Secretariat would prepare the procurement plan and the bidding documents. It would also&#13;
participate in bid evaluations and play a key role in contract management. The National&#13;
Tender Board would review the bidding documents, conduct evaluation and award of&#13;
contracts, and supervise contract management.&#13;
158. The National Tender Board is in place since 1997 and is increasingly familiar with&#13;
Bank procurement procedures. It is currently finalizing its own standard bidding&#13;
documents which build on standard Bank bidding documents. Taking into account that&#13;
the procurement methods to be used for the Program are essentially those of national&#13;
competitive bidding and national and international shopping, the National Tender Board&#13;
appears capable of fulfilling its responsibilities without difficulty.&#13;
159. The Technical Secretariat is a new institution without relevant procurement&#13;
experience. The procurement program financed by the Credit is not extensive. However,&#13;
given the fact that the upfront delivery of some goods and the completion of&#13;
rehabilitation of some works would be critical to the success of the Program, the&#13;
Technical Secretariat needs to be guided and assisted in order to fulfill its responsibilities&#13;
satisfactorily. Consequently, it was agreed that the following measures would be&#13;
undertaken: (i) recruiting a consultant to prepare the Program implementation manual;&#13;
(ii) hiring a Procurement Officer to prepare a procurement plan for the first year of&#13;
operation; and (iii), if deemed necessary, recruiting a consultant to help carry out critical&#13;
procurement activities required up to June 2002. Both activities would be financed under&#13;
the Project Preparation Facility. The adoption of a Program implementation manual&#13;
satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of Credit effectiveness.&#13;
5.3.2 Procurement plan&#13;
160. The Technical Secretariat would prepare the procurement plan for the first year of&#13;
operation before Credit effectiveness. It would update the plan every six months for&#13;
discussion with the Bank during supervision missions. Furthermore, regular Financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex      38&#13;
Monitoring Reports would present procurement activities in an appropriate degree of&#13;
detail (see paragraph 150).&#13;
5.3.3  Procurement methods43&#13;
161. Goods imported by the private sector imder Category (1), estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$2 million equivalent per contract, may be procured in accordance with established&#13;
commercial practices satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
162. Contracts for goods under Categories (2) to (5), estimated to cost US$300,000&#13;
equivalent or more, may be awarded by International Competitive Bidding (ICB).&#13;
However, given that some goods and items are required early in 2002, it is unlikely Ihat&#13;
this method would be used for goods needed before June 2002. Furthermore, since&#13;
demobilization from the RPA is expected to be implemented through a six-month cycle&#13;
and by groups not exceeding 5,000 ex-combatants, goods contracts valued more than the&#13;
above amount would be numbered and should not exceed two.&#13;
163. Goods estimated to cost less than US$300,000 equivalent per contract up to an&#13;
aggregate of US$400,000 may be awarded by National Competitive Bidding (NCB) as&#13;
described in paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 of the IDA procurement guidelines. Due to the&#13;
urgency of the Program, and in order to facilitate the speedy procurement of immediately&#13;
required drugs and other critical items, international and national shopping methods&#13;
would be employed more than is customary in Bank financed projects. Hence, goods&#13;
estimated to cost no more than the equivalent of US$200,000 per contract up to an&#13;
aggregate of US$800,000 may be procured on the basis of comparison of at least three&#13;
quotations at national or international level in accordance with the provisions of&#13;
paragraphs 3.5 and 3.6 of the Guidelines. A sample format for international shopping&#13;
would be included in the Program implementation manual.&#13;
164. Civil works contracts would be very limited in both number and value, hence no&#13;
ICB is foreseen. However, ICB procedures would apply for civil works estimated to cost&#13;
more than the equivalent of US$300,000. Civil works estimated to cost betvween&#13;
US$100,000 and US$300,000 equivalent per contract up to an aggregate of US$300,000&#13;
may be awarded by National Competitive Bidding (NCB) in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 of the Guidelines.&#13;
165. Given the urgent requirement to rehabilitate at least two demobilization centers and&#13;
up to two medical rehabilitation centers, on an exceptional basis, civil works estimated to&#13;
cost less than US$ 100,000 equivalent per contract up to an aggregate of US$200,000 may&#13;
be procured on the basis of quotations obtained from at least three qualified contractors in&#13;
response to a written invitation. The written invitation would include a description of the&#13;
works, basic technical specifications, completion date and if necessary the plan of the&#13;
works. The contract may be awarded to the contractor who offers the lowest quotation&#13;
provided that the bid is substantially responsive to the conditions specified in the written&#13;
43 The amounts per contract and the aggregate amounts apply to the IDA Credit only. See table 3 below for&#13;
a summary of procurement arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex       39&#13;
invitation. A simple format of the invitation to quote with all the subsequent documents&#13;
(instruction to bidders, model of contract etc.) would be included in the Program&#13;
implementation manual.&#13;
166. Consultants' services procured under the Credit would finance the strengthening of&#13;
local institutions responsible for the execution of the Program: the Technical Secretariat,&#13;
Provincial Program Offices, district administrations as well as associations and&#13;
community-based groups. The Credit would also finance technical studies in support of&#13;
Program execution, the monitoring of Program components, external financial audits and&#13;
external Program evaluations.&#13;
167. All consultant services estimated to cost more than US$100,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract would be selected using the Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) method.&#13;
For contracts estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent, the short list may be&#13;
comprised entirely of national consultants provided that at least three qualified national&#13;
consultants are available. However, if foreign firms express an interest in these contracts,&#13;
they would not be excluded from the selection process.&#13;
168. Consultant services for training, technical advisory services and implementation&#13;
support for special groups and HIV/AIDS activities estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$75,000 equivalent up to an aggregate of US$300,000 for firms may be awarded&#13;
through the Consultants' Qualifications method in accordance with the provisions of&#13;
paragraphs 3.7 of the Guidelines. Consulting services contracts meeting the requirements&#13;
of Section V. of the Consultants Guidelines up to an aggregate of US$150,000, may be&#13;
selected under the provisions for the Selection of Individual Consultants, i.e. in essence&#13;
through the comparison of the curriculum vitae of at least 3 qualified individuals.&#13;
169. Contracts for consultant services for financial audits and external evaluations,&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent up to an aggregate of US$200,000&#13;
may be awarded using the least cost selection method, in accordance with the provisions&#13;
of paragraphs 3.1 and 3.6 of the Bank's Guidelines for the selection of consultants.&#13;
170. UN agencies may be hired as consultants, where they are qualified to provide&#13;
technical assistance and advice in their area of expertise, according to the provisions of&#13;
paragraph 3.13 of the Guidelines. UN agencies may be hired on a single-source selection&#13;
basis if the criteria outlined in Section 3.9 of the Guidelines are fulfilled.&#13;
5.3.4 Thresholds for prior review&#13;
171. Goods and civil works contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of US$100,000 or&#13;
more would be subject to IDA prior review. In addition, the first three contracts of goods&#13;
under Category (3) and the first three contracts of civil works below the equivalent of&#13;
US$100,000 would be subject to IDA prior review.&#13;
172. For consultant services, all terms of reference and all single source selections&#13;
regardless of contract cost, would be subject to IDA prior review. Contracts estimated to&#13;
cost more than US$25,000 equivalent for individuals and more than US$50,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex                      40&#13;
equivalent for firms wouldL be subject to IDA prior review procedures. For consultants&#13;
contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of US$100,000 or more, opening the financial&#13;
envelopes would not take place prior to receiving the Bank's no-objection to the technical&#13;
evaluation. For contracts estimated to cost less than US$100,000 for firms, the Borrower&#13;
would notify IDA of the results of the technical evaluation prior to opening the financial&#13;
proposals.&#13;

audits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex        41&#13;
5.4  Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
174. A strong monitoring and evaluation system, complemented with close Bank&#13;
supervision, would seek to ensure that the Program reaches targeted beneficiaries in a&#13;
timely and efficient fashion. It is essential that information on all beneficiaries is captured&#13;
during the initial demobilization process, securely stored, and subsequently utilized to&#13;
inform  Program  implementation.44 A Management Information System  would be&#13;
established by the Technical Secretariat for this purpose before Credit effectiveness.&#13;
175. Establishment of a Management Information System. A well-functioning MIS is a&#13;
valuable management tool, as throughout Program implementation there is a need to&#13;
register and monitor the target group beneficiaries and Program implementation progress&#13;
and effectiveness. Furtherrnore, a good MIS can provide monitoring data on beneficiaries&#13;
and activities that can serve as an important input into the planning of subsequent&#13;
demobilization phases. An MIS would be established with simplicity in design and using&#13;
hardware and software for which expertise is readily available locally. Additionally, and&#13;
to keep track of the utilization of Program funds, it would be related to the financial&#13;
management system.&#13;
176. Monitoring would be undertaken at three levels: firstly, the Technical Secretariat,&#13;
secondly, the Provincial Program Office and thirdly, the community. The Information&#13;
Department of the Technical Secretariat would collect information during demobilization&#13;
operations, when ex-combatants report for RSA payments and when ex-combatants apply&#13;
for reintegration assistance. The Technical Secretariat would track the provision of&#13;
assistance to the ex-combatants throughout the life of the Program. In addition, within six&#13;
months of the Effectiveness date and annually thereafter, or upon the request of the&#13;
Association, surveys of a representative sample of a minimum of 3 percent of Program&#13;
beneficiaries would be conducted to verify that they (i) have received reinsertion and&#13;
reintegration benefits in accordance with the semi-annual work program and budget of&#13;
the Program, and (ii) have acquired the goods and services intended.&#13;
177. Evaluation. Independent evaluations of Program implementation would be carried out&#13;
annually and would consist of quantitative and qualitative parts. An analysis of the&#13;
databases and existing administrative records and reports would establish to what extent the&#13;
Program as such as well as the individual components have achieved their objectives. As&#13;
the integration of ex-combatants into communities is a major factor for the long-term&#13;
success of the Program, the statistical evaluation would be complemented with a&#13;
beneficiary assessment consisting of participant observation and key informant and focal&#13;
group interviews. It would be directed towards the ex-combatants and their families as&#13;
primary and the communities as secondary beneficiaries.&#13;
178. Performance indicators. The Technical Secretariat and Provincial Program Offices&#13;
would measure Program performance against the agreed performance indicators specified&#13;
below (see Table 4).&#13;
44 Specific procedures for registering vulnerable ex-combatants demobilized during stage 1, as well as for&#13;
registering ex-FAR, would be included in the Program implementation manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex                     42&#13;
Table 4. Key Periformance Indicators&#13;
Component                             Key Performance Indicators&#13;
* About 5,000 ex-combatants from the RPA are demobilized every six months in 2002&#13;
and 2003.&#13;
Demobilization  * Each returning ex-combatant from an armed group is demobilized in accordance with&#13;
the criteria and procedures set out in the Program implementation manual.&#13;
* Each ex-FAR ex-combatant has received an ID card and is captured in the MIS&#13;
database.&#13;
* Each demobilized ex-combatant has received a BNK within one month of&#13;
demobilization.&#13;
* The time elapsed between registration in a Provincial Program Office and bank&#13;
Reinsertion       payment oi the first installment of the recognition of service allowance to each&#13;
demobilized RPA ex-combatant does not exceed 2 months.&#13;
* Each ex-FAR ex-combatant has registered at a Provincial Program Office and has&#13;
received his/her recognition of service allowance within 6 months of registration.&#13;
* Reintegration grant payments to demobilized ex-combatants are made no later than 9&#13;
Reintegration     months after demobilization.&#13;
* Average costs for reintegration assistance under the Vulnerability Support Window&#13;
do not exce ed FRw1 50,000.&#13;
* All demobilized female ex-coinbatants have received reinsertion and reintegration&#13;
benefits under the Program in the same amount and according to the same procedures&#13;
as demobilized male ex-combatants.&#13;
Special target  * Each demobilized disabled ex-combatant has received medical rehabilitation&#13;
groups            assistamce within 18 months of demobilization.&#13;
* Each demobilized child ex-combatant has received targeted reintegration assistance&#13;
within 12 months of demobilization.&#13;
* 12 Provincial Program Offices are operational within 3 months of Credit&#13;
effectiveness in accordance with criteria set forth in the Program implementation&#13;
manual.&#13;
Implementation  * At least 50% of CDCs are administering the approval process of grants for income-&#13;
Arrangements      generating activities within 12 months of Credit effectiveness.&#13;
* An independent evaluation is carried out annually and includes an analysis of&#13;
environmenital and social monitoring indicators.&#13;
Other          * Recurrent expenditures on education and health reach FRw 36.4 billion in 2002, FRw&#13;
40.8 billion in 2003 and FRw 45.7 billion in 2004.&#13;
5.5   Program Sustainabilitl&#13;
179. The RDRP is designed to aid the sustainable social and economic reintegration of&#13;
ex-combatants. In this regard, it would make a positive contribution to the socio-&#13;
economic status of ex-combatants, their families and their communities of settlement.&#13;
The Program would also foster micro-economic recovery by transforming ex-combatants&#13;
into positive economic actors and injecting financial resources at the local level.&#13;
Furthermore, the Program would encourage national reconciliation and empower&#13;
communities by providing incentives for cooperation and strengthening CDCs/CPAs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex         43&#13;
Although the RDRC itself is a temporary structure, the Program would strengthen&#13;
Government capacities at the provincial and local level for developing, managing and&#13;
monitoring development interventions.&#13;

6.1  Benefits&#13;
180. The Program would enable the Government to consolidate its social and econornic&#13;
recovery efforts and overcome the setbacks attributable to the persistent insecurity in the&#13;
Great Lakes region. The Program is designed to facilitate and expedite the process of&#13;
returning about 45,000 ex-combatants to productive social and economic life and assist&#13;
another 12,000 economically vulnerable ex-combatants demobilized under stage I to&#13;
establish sustainable livelihoods. The return of such a large percentage of the labor force&#13;
to the civilian economy is expected to inject significant human resource capacity into the&#13;
labor market. The provision of assistance throughout the country, could contribute to a&#13;
regeneration of rural financial markets. Finally, the community-based reintegration&#13;
approach would strengthen the capacity of CDCs and CPAs.&#13;
181. A secondary benefit would be the freeing up of resources currently allocated to the&#13;
defense sector, and their reallocation towards social and economic sectors. Such public&#13;
expenditure restructuring would allow Government to restore expenditure levels in the&#13;
social sectors in line with its poverty reduction strategy.&#13;
6.2  Risks and Mitigation Measures&#13;
182. External risks. Firstly, there is a link between improved security in the eastern DRC&#13;
and the sub-region, the timing of Rwandese troop withdrawal and the timing and scale of&#13;
subsequent demobilization of RPA forces. In the event of a collapse of the peace process&#13;
and resumption of hostilities either in the DRC, within Rwanda or in the sub-region, IDA&#13;
would consider exercising its remedies under the legal agreement. Secondly, even if&#13;
large-scale violent conflict did not resume, delays in the implementation of the peace&#13;
process might delay the implementation of the Program.&#13;
183. These risks are mitigated by several factors. First, the ongoing negotiations between&#13;
the parties within the framework of the Lusaka peace process, and the deployment of the&#13;
MONUC, serve as confidence building mechanisms for all parties to the conflict. Second,&#13;
the Government of Rwanda's commitment to unilaterally launch stage II of the RDRP&#13;
and reduce the size of the RPA provides an indication of its commitment to the peace&#13;
process and would in itself serve as an important confidence-building measure.45 Third,&#13;
the Government of Rwanda's willingness to accept the return of members of armed&#13;
groups to Rwanda provides evidence of its commitment to national reconciliation.&#13;
45 Conversely, a deliberate decision not to proceed with the Program may have negative repercussions on&#13;
regional peace dynamics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex        44&#13;
184. The major Program-specific risks ancl mitigation measures are as follows:&#13;
(i)   Program resources are diverted toward military spending. Appropriate&#13;
safeguards with respect to financial management, procurement and&#13;
disbursement have been developed to avoid any such misuse of Program&#13;
resources;&#13;
(ii)  Savings from demobilization do not translate into increased spending in&#13;
the health and education sectors. Government expenditures would be&#13;
carefully monitored by IDA. in the context of its assistance program;&#13;
(iii)  Given ihe limited human resource capacity in Rwanda's public and private&#13;
sectors, implementation is unsatisfactory. The Program would carefull,y&#13;
monitor implementation progress and the reintegration experiences of ex-&#13;
combatants. The Technical Secretariat would be reinforced with additional&#13;
qualified staff, and the Program would invest in strengthening the&#13;
capacities of CDCs, CPAs, and local implementing partners;&#13;
(iv)  HIV/AIDS spreads via the RDRP. The HIV/AIDS prevention and&#13;
mitigation measures included in the Program's design would mitigate this&#13;
risk significantly; and&#13;
(v)   Donors do not provide sufficient resources to fully cover the fwuding gap.&#13;
The Bank has closely consulted donor and UN partners to ensure broad-&#13;
based support and adequate financial assistance for the Program. Plediges&#13;
received so far cover the fumding gap. If sufficient donor funds were not&#13;
forthcoming nevertheless, Program parameters would be adjusted to the&#13;
available resources.&#13;
6.3  Environmental and Social Aspects&#13;
185. Building on lessons from reintegration programs for displaced persons and ex-&#13;
combatants in Rwanda and elsewhere, the Program contains a number of specific&#13;
elements to identify social and environmental risks and devise appropriate mitigation&#13;
measures. The procedures and measures would be detailed in the Program&#13;
implementation manual (see attachment 10 for a detailed description of social and&#13;
environmental management arrangements). Measures aimed at mitigating social impacts&#13;
of the Program include: R(i) ensuring that there is no involuntary resettlement or&#13;
displacement; (ii) carrying out specific social reintegration activities; (iii) addressing the&#13;
needs of female ex-combatants and of partners of ex-combatants; and (iv) carrying out&#13;
activities targeted at child ex-combatants.&#13;
186. Shortly after Credit effectiveness, and building on relevant preparatory activities, a&#13;
social assessment would be undertaken. This would include the following: (i) a&#13;
stakeholder analysis; (ii) an institutional capacity diagnostic; (iii) the development of a&#13;
public consultation mecharnism as part of the RDRP's sensitization program; and (iv) the&#13;
design of a participatory monitoring and evaluation framework. The social assessmenit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex      45&#13;
would help identify the social and cultural structure of incentives and constraints that&#13;
guide and govern behavior with respect to building social cohesion and promoting&#13;
sustainable use of natural resources. Furthermore, it would help determine relevant social&#13;
indicators for participatory monitoring, including on social exclusion of returning ex-&#13;
combatants.&#13;
187. The Program is classified as environmental category B, as it includes support to&#13;
income-generating activities. However, the phased and widely dispersed reintegration of&#13;
45,000 ex-combatants into civilian life is expected to be environmentally neutral.&#13;
Furthermore, the Program would not finance the construction or rehabilitation of&#13;
infrastructure other than the rehabilitation of two demobilization centers and two medical&#13;
rehabilitation centers. Environmental mitigation measures under the Program include the&#13;
screening and monitoring of sub-projects financed under the reintegration component for&#13;
environmental impact according to the procedures, acceptable to IDA, set up by the&#13;
MINALOC for the CRDP. Furthermore, adequate arrangements for medical waste&#13;
disposal of HIV/AIDS testing materials' would be included in the Program&#13;
implementation manual. -&#13;
188. The institutional arrangements established under the CRDP for decentralized&#13;
monitoring are working well and would be the basis for participatory social and&#13;
environmental monitoring under the RDRP. The annual evaluations would include an&#13;
assessment of, among others: the procedures to access land; the occurrence of involuntary&#13;
displacement or resettlement; the degree of community acceptance; the existence of&#13;
discrimination on the basis of gender or previous military affiliation; the level of personal&#13;
security of ex-combatants; the level of criminal activities undertaken by ex-combatants;&#13;
and the impact on an ex-combatant's family members. The evaluations would, thus, help&#13;
identify social and environmental impact, determine the appropriateness of procedures&#13;
and processes, and make recommendations for improvements where necessary.&#13;
7 Financial and Economic Justification&#13;
189. Analysis of defense expenditure. From 1998 to 2001, defense expenditure decreased&#13;
from 4.3 percent of GDP to 3.3 percent. As a share of recurrent expenditure, defense&#13;
spending decreased from 36.1 percent to 23.7 percent. Nominal defense expenditure&#13;
decreased from FRw 27.2 billion in 1999 to FRw 25.1 billion in 2001 (table 5). However,&#13;
this decrease is mainly due to the separation between the RPA and the National Police in&#13;
2000. Between 1998 and 2001, the ratio of military to social spending decreased from 1.5&#13;
to 0.6.&#13;

190. Analysis of alternatives. The Government's proposal, and the IDA appraisal of it,&#13;
have taken into consideration various alternatives in the design of the RDRP. The final&#13;
design is based on best practices and responds to the specific requirements of the&#13;
situation in Rwanda. It pursues a structured approach to demobilization and reinsertion,&#13;
as compared to a simple discharge from the RPA. The externalities of structured health&#13;
screening and HIV/AIDS counseling prior to the ex-combatants' return to their&#13;
communities, along with the benefit of providing a safety net to facilitate the re-&#13;
establishment of households and to avoid social tensions, were judged to exceed the&#13;
related costs. With respect to the economic reintegration, the Program's design attempts&#13;
to minimize interference with market forces and to maximize the choice of the individual&#13;
and synergies with ongoing interventions. Furthermore, economic reintegration measures&#13;
would be based on the socio-economic profile of the ex-combatants, their own efforts and&#13;
aspirations, and the specific opportunity structure in their communities of return.&#13;
191. Cost-effectiveness analysis. The Program design seeks to minimize costs without&#13;
compromising quality. Whenever possible, existing structures would be used rather than&#13;
new parallel systems created. For example, with respect to the disbursement mechanisms,&#13;
highly automated RSA payments would be effected directly by the Technical Secretariat&#13;
through participating banks. In the same vein, the existing provincial administrations&#13;
would be charged with monitoring Program implementation. Furthermore, the&#13;
strengthening of capacities at the CDC level is expected to have a high payoff for&#13;
implementing community driven development projects generally. Finally, with overall&#13;
per capita cost of US$800 equivalent, the costs of the second stage of the RDRP are well&#13;
within the range of comparable programs in Sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;

Social and Environmental Management Arrangements&#13;
The second stage of the Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program (RDRP)&#13;
aims at demobilizing a large number of ex-combatants from the Rwanda Patriotic Army&#13;
and armed groups and at supporting their reintegration into civilian life. To enhance the&#13;
chances of success, the RDRP needs to properly address a range of social and&#13;
environmental aspects. The objective of this analysis is to identify important social and&#13;
environmental dimensions, summarize the social and environmental management&#13;
arrangements under the Program, outline targeted monitoring and evaluation activities,&#13;
and propose institutional capacity building activities.&#13;
1.    Social and environmental dimensions&#13;
Successful long-term reintegration of ex-combatants can make a major contribution to&#13;
conflict resolution and the restoration of social capital, while failure to achieve&#13;
reintegration can lead to crime and insecurity and even increase the risk of resumed&#13;
conflict. Reintegration takes place at the community level, and the perceptions, attitudes&#13;
and organizational capacity of communities to receive and support ex-combatants&#13;
become a major factor for determining the success or failure of a demobilization and&#13;
reintegration program.&#13;
Ex-combatants may face profound social reintegration problems. There may be a&#13;
generalized fear that ex-combatants are conveyers of violence, crime and sexually&#13;
transmitted diseases. Communities may resent support provided to what is perceived as&#13;
an overly privileged group. Ex-combatants may be discriminated against on the basis of&#13;
previous military affiliation. Their personal security may be at risk especially when they&#13;
committed atrocities in the communities to which they retum.&#13;
Female ex-combatants who have become accustomed to a more independent way of life&#13;
in the military, may struggle to adapt to expectations of traditional communities. Female&#13;
partners of ex-combatants and their children who migrate to communities of other ethnic,&#13;
linguistic and/or cultural backgrounds may be rejected. Last but not least, the years of&#13;
development children lose to soldiering profoundly affect their future identity.&#13;
Ex-combatants may also exert pressure on the natural resource base especially in&#13;
communities with high population densities. Community members may be involuntarily&#13;
displaced or ex-combatants involuntarily resettled to communities other than of their&#13;
choice. Traditional tenure arrangements may bar female ex-combatants from access to&#13;
land. Ex-combatants may start income-generating activities that, if uncontrolled, may&#13;
lead to overgrazing, deforestation or improper waste management.&#13;
2.    Social and environmental management arrangements&#13;
Building on lessons from reintegration programs for displaced persons and ex-combatants&#13;
in Rwanda and elsewhere, the Program contains a number of specific elements to identify&#13;
social and environmental risks and devise appropriate mitigation measures. The&#13;
59&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex      60&#13;
procedures and measures would be spelled out in detail in the Program implementation&#13;
manual.&#13;
Access to land. Ex-combatants would be free to settle in the community of their choice.&#13;
Their access to land would be facilitated with the same community-based procedures&#13;
used for others who need land. Specifically, any Rwandese in search of land for housing&#13;
or agricultural production would normally contact his/her local administration, which&#13;
would allot an available piece of public land for use if possible. In the event that no&#13;
public land were available, the local administration consults with relevant community&#13;
members to determine whether they would agree to cede part of their land to the&#13;
newcomer(s) on a voluntary basis. (The Program would not bear the costs of land&#13;
acquisition.) No citizen would be compelled to cede any of his/her land. There would&#13;
thus be no involuntary displacement of civilians as a result of ex-combatants settling in a&#13;
community.&#13;
Social reintegration. The objective of social reintegration assistance would be to promote&#13;
reconciliation between ex-combatants and civilians in communities of settlement. Social&#13;
reintegration may be especially difficult in the context of Rwanda, as many ex--&#13;
combatants lost their famnilies during the genocide and/or came from neighboring&#13;
countries and have no 'home' to which they can return, while others have committed acts&#13;
of violence in their communities. The participation of communities in the RDRP,&#13;
especially through the Community Development Committees (CDCs) and Politico-&#13;
Administrative Committees (Comites politico-administratifs; CPAs), is considered&#13;
critical for successful reintegration. Specific activities to be carried out by the Rwanda&#13;
Demobilization and Reintegration Commission (RDRC) under this component would&#13;
include:&#13;
(i)   assessments of community perceptions of ex-combatants and ex-combatants'&#13;
perceptions of communities;&#13;
(ii)  expansion of current national and community reconciliation activities;&#13;
(iii)  information and sensitization of ex-combatants and communities through&#13;
outreach activities, including training of counselors and sensitization efforts&#13;
(national awareness campaign, presentation of the RDRP, discussion of ex-&#13;
combatants and community rights and obligations, regular field visits by&#13;
Program staff for sensitization and problem solving, etc.); and&#13;
(iv)  specialized counseling (e.g., family, HIV/AIDS, and gender).&#13;
Gender. Given experiences of other demobilization and reintegration programs, the&#13;
RDRP would provide targeted support for the social and economic reintegration of&#13;
female ex-combatants. Specific measures would include the following:&#13;
(i)   Ensuring that the special needs (e.g., security, sanitation) of female ex-&#13;
combatants are taken into account in the demobilization centers;&#13;
(ii)  ensuring that all benefits for ex-combatants are equal for and equally&#13;
accessible to men and women;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex      61&#13;
(iii)  encouraging implementing partners to ensure that their reintegration support&#13;
activities within the Vulnerability Support Window facilitate the participation&#13;
of female ex-combatants;&#13;
(iv)  encouraging female ex-combatants to participate in existing women's&#13;
associations;&#13;
(v)   including partners of ex-combatants and women in communities of return in&#13;
community-level counseling activities;&#13;
(vi)  strengthening the gender awareness and capacity of RDRC staff and of those&#13;
CDCs and CPAs to which a significant number of female ex-combatants will&#13;
return; and&#13;
(vii)  monitoring the impact of the Program on partners of ex-combatants and&#13;
women in communities of return and bringing emerging problems to the&#13;
attention of the relevant authorities.&#13;
Child ex-combatants. Child ex-combatants among armed groups will likely represent a&#13;
significant target group for the second stage of the RDRP. Child ex-combatants would be&#13;
identified during the verification screening in the demobilization centers and separated&#13;
from adult ex-combatants as soon as possible. They would undergo specialized&#13;
counseling in a separate site. Assistance to the reintegration of child ex-combatants&#13;
would include family tracing and unification, trauma counseling and psycho-social care,&#13;
and facilitation of access to education and recreation in communities of settlement.&#13;
Children older than 15 years may have different needs and would receive appropriate&#13;
support. Under the overall coordination of the RDRC, the Ministry of Local Government&#13;
and Social Affairs (MINALOC) would be responsible for implementation in&#13;
collaboration with experienced partners such as UNICEF.&#13;
Environmental classification. The Program is classified as environmental category B, as&#13;
it includes support to income-generating activities. However, the phased and widely&#13;
dispersed reintegration of 45,000 ex-combatants into civilian life is expected to be&#13;
environmentally neutral. Furthermore, the Program does not anticipate support to any&#13;
major physical works and would only finance the rehabilitation of two demobilization&#13;
centers and two medical rehabilitation centers.&#13;
Environmental screening. The RDRP would provide reintegration support to ex-&#13;
combatants in the form of sub-projects, which would include agricultural and non-farm&#13;
income-generating activities (IGAs), vocational and apprenticeship training, housing,&#13;
employment, tools, and education and scholarships. The cost per sub-project would be&#13;
below US$350 per beneficiary. IGAs would be screened for environmental impact and&#13;
monitored according to the procedures set up by the MINALOC for the Bank-financed&#13;
Community Reintegration and Development Program (CRDP). The objective of&#13;
environmental screening would, thus, be to minimize negative environmental impacts of&#13;
the Program.&#13;
The following sub-project cycle has proven effective under the CRDP and similar&#13;
interventions and would be applied to the RDRP IGA activities as well: (i) an ex-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex         62&#13;
combatant prepares a sub-project proposal, with appropriate assistance by a CDC or sub-&#13;
contracted NGO/associiationri; (ii) the respective CDC appraises the proposal per CRD)P&#13;
criteria (including on social and environmental impact); and (iii) if approved by the CDC,&#13;
funds are transferred to the bank account of the ex-combatant. Provincial program offices&#13;
and CDCs would supervise sub-project implementation.&#13;
The screening procedures are tailored to the small-scale nature of income-generating&#13;
activities, examining the potential for impacts and identifying any mitigation measures.&#13;
The focus of the screening would be on the following issues: water, health and sanitation,&#13;
natural resource exploitatiom, erosion, pesticide use and any other safeguard related issue.&#13;
The CDCs would consult the relevant line ministry representative (charges de service for&#13;
agriculture, environment, water and sanitation, health, education, social affairs) as&#13;
needed. In accordance with CRDP guidelines, certain activities such as charcoal making&#13;
would be rejected. The screening would also assess the potential environmental impact of&#13;
the IGA on neighboring communities. In case of wider negative environmental impact,&#13;
actions would be agreed upon with the relevant local administrations.&#13;
3.    Social and environmental monitoring and evaluation&#13;
A strong monitoring and evaluation system and close supervision would seek to ensure&#13;
that the Program reaches the intended beneficiaries and has a generally positive impact&#13;
on the receiving communities. The basic parameters and monitoring indicators for the&#13;
environmental aspects of the Program are already in place through the CRDP. Whilst&#13;
experience with such programs in other countries has informed the design of the social&#13;
components of the RDRP, baseline data for the Program's social dimensions are yet to be&#13;
collected.&#13;
Social assessment. Shortly after Credit effectiveness and building on relevant preparatory&#13;
activities (beneficiary assessment, preparation of sensitization program and of pre-&#13;
demobilization orientation program), a social assessment would be undertaken and would&#13;
include the following:&#13;
(i)   a stakeholder analysis;&#13;
(ii)  an institutional capacity diagnostic;&#13;
(iii)  the development of a public consultation mechanism as part of the RDR?'s&#13;
sensitization program; and&#13;
(iv)  the design of a participatory monitoring and evaluation framework.&#13;
The social assessment would help identify the social and cultural structure of incentives&#13;
and constraints that guide and govern behavior with respect to building social cohesion&#13;
and promoting sustainable use of natural resources. Furthermore, it would help determine&#13;
relevant social indicators for participatory monitoring, including on social exclusion of&#13;
returning ex-combatants.&#13;
Participatory monitoring. The institutional arrangements established under the CRDP for&#13;
decentralized monitoring are working well and would be the basis for participatory social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program - Technical Annex      63&#13;
and environmental monitoring under the RDRP. Specifically, the CDCs and CPAs would&#13;
monitor sub-projects and social and environmental indicators on an ongoing basis at the&#13;
community level. The Provincial Program Offices would be responsible for technical and&#13;
financial monitoring of reintegration activities at the provincial level, regularly reporting&#13;
to the RDRC on the application of all relevant procedures and processes. At the central&#13;
level, the Ministry of Lands, Resettlement and Environmental Protection (MINITERE)&#13;
and MINALOC would advise the RDRC on the substantive environmental and social&#13;
aspects of the Program.&#13;
Information would be shared horizontally (especially important for the beneficiaries and&#13;
in general for sake of transparency) and vertically in the management structure of the&#13;
Program. Information would be readily available for assembly and analysis into periodic&#13;
monitoring and evaluation reports. Such a system requires cooperation from all levels:&#13;
from the beneficiary all the way up to the RDRC. The Program's computerized&#13;
Management Information System would be designed around these parameters.&#13;
Independent evaluations. A special Program element would be annual evaluations of&#13;
environmental and social indicators as part of the annual Program evaluations undertaken&#13;
by independent consultants. These evaluations would include a beneficiary assessment&#13;
and a review of Program achievements. The issues to be addressed would include, among&#13;
others: the procedures to access land; the occurrence of involuntary displacement or&#13;
resettlement; the degree of community acceptance; the existence of discrimination on the&#13;
basis of gender or previous military affiliation; the level of personal security of ex-&#13;
combatants; the level of criminal activities undertaken by ex-combatants; and the impact&#13;
on an ex-combatant's family members. The evaluations would, thus, help identify social&#13;
and environmental impact, determine the appropriateness of procedures and processes,&#13;
and make recommendations for improvements where necessary.&#13;
The monitoring and evaluation system is designed such that the regular review of social&#13;
and environmental aspects is part and parcel of Program implementation, and that&#13;
mitigation measures would be initiated quickly as needed.&#13;
4.    Institutional capacity building&#13;
Program benefits would be spread throughout the country. To facilitate rapid Program&#13;
start-up while allowing time to build capacities in other parts of the country, reintegration&#13;
activities under stage II would be prioritized by province according to the settlement&#13;
patterns of ex-combatants and implementation capacities at the provincial and community&#13;
levels, respectively. Special capacity-building efforts and training would be required at&#13;
all levels of Program implementation. The MINALOC has already developed a general&#13;
environmental and social awareness and sensitization module and would take the lead in&#13;
building capacities at the district, provincial and central levels.&#13;
Depending on the target group, training activities would include: sensitization workshops&#13;
for ex-combatants and host communities, training of trainers in collaboration with local&#13;
and/or international partners, NGOs and community associations, and technical training&#13;
for line ministry staff and RDRC staff. Capacity building activities would be based on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Rwanda Demobilization and Reiintegration Program - Technical Annex     64&#13;
written materials and models prepared in the appropriate communication medium,&#13;
corresponding to the t:hemes in the various workshops (i.e. planning, leadership skills,&#13;
project implementation, conflict resolution, roles and responsibilities, etc.)&#13;
The MINALOC would be responsible for providing and/or recruiting trainers. Trainers&#13;
would use an experiential learning metlodology that emphasizes a high level of&#13;
participation and interaction. To the fullest extent possible, women trainers/facilitators&#13;
would be identified to draw upon their local knowledge and experiences. To ensure&#13;
continuity and conformity in the overall capacity building program, the core training staff&#13;
would be engaged in the follow-up training activities.&#13;
At the community level, the focus would be on those CDCs and CPAs that are not yet&#13;
benefiting from development projects. After an assessment of their implementation&#13;
needs, and using the Program implementation manual and the training manual developed&#13;
by the MINALOC for community development projects, key members of CDCs and&#13;
CPAs would be familiarized with Program procedures and would receive required&#13;
training. As necessary, relevant CDC members and partner agencies would also undergo&#13;
training for supervising the IGA sub-component of the RDRP. Very few of the line&#13;
ministry agents have environmental and social specialists. Therefore, the capacity&#13;
building component would -ry to address the awareness issue through a targeted training&#13;
module that addresses the tezhnical areas of concern.&#13;

            Rwanda - Emergency Demobilization and
            Reintegration Program Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Emergency Demobilization and
            Reintegration Program Project aims at helping return
            ex-combatants to their communities to resume a productive
            social, and economic life, by reallocating resources from
            defense towards poverty reduction. The objectives include:
            1) demobilization of an estimated 45,000 ex-combatants from
            the Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA), and members of armed
            groups, while supporting their transition to civilian life;
            2) supporting the reinsertion of ex-Forces Armees Rwandaises
            (FAR); 3) supporting the social and economic reintegration
            of all ex-combatants to be demobilized in stage II, and all
            stage I ex-combatants who remain socio-economically
            vulnerable; and, 4) facilitating the reallocation of
            Government expenditure form defense, to social and economic
            sectors. The project includes a quick disbursing mechanism
            that uses a positive list of imports, to generate
            counterpart funds to finance a rapid Program implementation.
            Nonetheless, the resumption of hostilities is the major
            external risk, while program specific risks are linked to
            weak implementation capacity.
