            Micro-infrastructure - regulators must take
            small operators seriously
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Small-scale providers of infrastructure
            services, are proving to be more responsive than utilities,
            to needs of poor consumers. They might be delivering water
            services by tanker, transport services by minivan, or
            electricity through mini-grids, or household solar panels.
            They make their services affordable to the poor, by using
            cheaper technology, or permitting flexible payment.
            Regulators are customarily hostile to these alternative
            providers. The note thus suggests that the interests of the
            poor, would be better served if regulators treated them as
            valid service providers, and brought them under a regulatory umbrella.
