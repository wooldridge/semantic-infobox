INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The past year was one of significant further growth for ICSID. Five more&#13;
countries joined the Centre. The caseload grew at a record-breaking pace:&#13;
over 25 new arbitration cases were registered. They raised to 63 the number&#13;
of cases pending under the ICSID Convention or ICSID Additional Facility&#13;
Rules. Most of these cases were brought to ICSID under the numerous bilat-&#13;
eral investment treaties that provide for the settlement of investment disputes&#13;
by ICSID arbitration. Several of the cases were brought under multilateral&#13;
treaties with similar provisions; these notably include the North American&#13;
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ICSID also continued the publications program that makes the Centre a&#13;
leading source of information and analysis on foreign investment law. Three&#13;
releases of the Centre's collections of investment laws and treaties were&#13;
published as were two issues of the ICSID Review--Foreign Investment Law&#13;
Journal. Partnerships with other arbitration institutions were enhanced by par-&#13;
ticipation in the International Federation of Commercial Arbitration Institutions&#13;
(IFCAI) and the publishing by ICSID of the IFCAI Newsletter. Staff presenta-&#13;
tions at arbitration conferences and seminars continued to be a further impor-&#13;
tant means of disseminating knowledge about ICSID and its activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Another highlight of the fiscal year was the adoption by the Administrative&#13;
Council, on the proposal of the Secretariat, of new amendments of the ICSID&#13;
Regulations and Rules and Additional Facility Rules. The amendments were&#13;
the first made to the ICSID Regulations and Rules for almost 20 years and&#13;
the first ever to the Additional Facility Rules. The resulting streamlining and&#13;
updating of the Regulations and Rules should assist the Centre in the admin-&#13;
istration of its expanding caseload.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Details of these and other developments in fiscal year 2003 are set forth&#13;
below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SIGNATURES AND RATIFICATIONS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During the year, the ICSID Convention was signed by four more countries:&#13;
Brunei Darussalam, Lebanon, Serbia and Montenegro, and Timor-Leste. This&#13;
increased the number of signatories to 154. Five countries took the final step&#13;
towards becoming Contracting States and members of ICSID by depositing&#13;
instruments of ratification of the Convention. These were Brunei Darussalam,&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Guatemala, Lebanon, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Timor-Leste. With&#13;
these ratifications, the number of Contracting States reached 139.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A complete list of the Contracting States and other signatories of the&#13;
Convention appears in Annex 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DISPUTES BEFORE THE CENTRE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In fiscal year 2003, ICSID registered 26 new arbitration cases under the ICSID&#13;
Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules. They raised to 129 the&#13;
total number of cases registered by ICSID. Including the newly registered&#13;
cases, there were 63 ICSID Convention and Additional Facility arbitration pro-&#13;
ceedings pending before the Centre during the year. Of these cases, 47 were&#13;
submitted to ICSID under the dispute-settlement provisions of bilateral invest-&#13;
ment treaties; 6 under the corresponding provisions of the NAFTA; 7 pursuant&#13;
to arbitration clauses of investment contracts between the parties; and 3&#13;
under the arbitration provisions of investment laws.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Almost half of the cases before ICSID involved Western Hemisphere coun-&#13;
tries. Most of the remaining cases were, by major region, evenly divided&#13;
among countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the Middle East and&#13;
North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa. The investments underlying the cases&#13;
included equity contributions, concession agreements and other contractual&#13;
forms of investment in virtually all economic sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During the year, 16 new ICSID arbitral tribunals were established. Altogether,&#13;
there were in fiscal year 2003, 45 persons from 21 countries serving as ICSID&#13;
arbitrators. Proceedings before them were conducted in English in about half&#13;
the cases. In the other half of the cases, French and/or Spanish were proce-&#13;
dural languages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In one of the cases before ICSID in fiscal year 2003, the proceeding was&#13;
discontinued following an amicable settlement by the parties of their dispute.&#13;
In another case, the proceeding was discontinued because of non-payment&#13;
of the required advances. Arbitral awards were issued in seven further cases.&#13;
Four of those awards upheld the claims involved in whole or in part. The three&#13;
other awards dismissed the claims on the merits or for lack of jurisdiction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Article 52 of the ICSID Convention provides for the possible annulment of an&#13;
arbitral award by a three-member ad hoc committee. During the year, a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4                                                                         I C S I D&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
decision was rendered by such a committee partially annulling the award&#13;
concerned. A party may also seek the rectification and interpretation of an&#13;
award. In fiscal year 2003, a tribunal partially granted a request for the rectifi-&#13;
cation of its award and denied a request for interpretation of the award. In&#13;
another case, a decision on a request for rectification was rendered by an&#13;
ad hoc committee.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition to administering cases governed by the ICSID Convention and the&#13;
Additional Facility Rules, the Centre has, at the request of the parties and&#13;
tribunals concerned, agreed to provide administrative services for NAFTA&#13;
Investment Chapter cases initiated under the Arbitration Rules of the United&#13;
Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). During the&#13;
year, ICSID provided such services for three NAFTA/UNCITRAL Arbitration&#13;
Rules cases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Annex 2 provides a chronology of developments in each of the ICSID&#13;
Convention and Additional Facility cases before ICSID in fiscal year 2003.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PANELS OF CONCILIATORS AND OF ARBITRATORS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Under the Convention, ICSID maintains a Panel of Conciliators and a Panel&#13;
of Arbitrators. Each Contracting State may designate up to four persons to&#13;
each Panel. The Chairman of the Administrative Council may designate up to&#13;
10 persons to each Panel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the course of the year, new designations to the Panels were made by seven&#13;
Contracting States: Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Slovenia, Sri Lanka, United States&#13;
and Venezuela. The names of the designees are provided in Annex 3. With&#13;
these new designations, there are now 496 members of the Panels. The com-&#13;
plete list of Panel members is posted on the website of ICSID.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PUBLICATIONS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Fiscal year 2003 marked the thirtieth anniversary of the launching of ICSID's&#13;
first publication in the field of foreign investment law. This is the Centre's&#13;
continuously updated loose-leaf collection of Investment Laws of the World.&#13;
During the year, one new release was issued for this collection. The new&#13;
release contained the laws of five countries: Brazil, El Salvador, Kazakhstan,&#13;
Serbia and Montenegro, and Solomon Islands. With these additions, the col-&#13;
lection contains the basic investment laws of 131 countries.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
ICSID has for 20 years published a similar collection of Investment Treaties.&#13;
In the past year, two new releases were added to this second collection.&#13;
They contained the texts of 40 bilateral investment treaties, bringing to over&#13;
900 the total number of treaties in the collection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Since 1986, the Centre has also published the semiannual ICSID Review--&#13;
Foreign Investment Law Journal. The Fall 2002 and Spring 2003 issues of the&#13;
journal were completed in fiscal year 2003. The Fall 2002 issue included arti-&#13;
cles on emerging multilateral investment rules and on jurisdictional challenges&#13;
in arbitrations under the Investment Chapter of the NAFTA. Articles on invest-&#13;
ing in the energy sector in Latin America and on arbitrating expropriation&#13;
claims were included in the Spring 2003 issue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During the year, two issues of News from ICSID were published. The Winter&#13;
2002 issue featured an article on the new amendments of the Regulations and&#13;
Rules of ICSID and an overview of the changing landscape of international&#13;
commercial arbitration. The Spring 2003 issue included a paper on applicable&#13;
law in arbitrations involving States.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ICSID is a member of the International Federation of Commercial Arbitration&#13;
Institutions (IFCAI) and is represented on IFCAI's governing Council. ICSID&#13;
has assumed responsibility for compiling and publishing the semiannual&#13;
IFCAI Newsletter. The first two issues of the IFCAI Newsletter to be published&#13;
by the Centre appeared in fiscal year 2003.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ICSID continued to update its website &lt;www.worldbank.org/icsid&gt; with&#13;
information about the Centre and its activities. With the consent of the par-&#13;
ties, the Centre posts on the website the texts of decisions and awards ren-&#13;
dered in ICSID cases. Decisions and awards from four cases were posted on&#13;
the website in fiscal year 2003.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A complete list of the Centre's publications appears in Annex 4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CONFERENCES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ICSID co-sponsors, with the American Arbitration Association and the&#13;
International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce,&#13;
a series of annual colloquia on international arbitration. The nineteenth collo-&#13;
quium in this series was held in New York City on November 8, 2002. It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
addressed current evidentiary issues; assessing damages in international arbitra-&#13;
tion; institutional developments; and the selection and challenge of arbitrators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ICSID staff participated in several further conferences organized by interna-&#13;
tional organizations and arbitration institutions. These included the&#13;
International Federation of Commercial Arbitration Institutions (IFCAI)&#13;
Institutional Section Meeting (held in Paris on November 22, 2002), the All-&#13;
Africa Conference on Law, Justice and Development (held in Abuja on&#13;
February 4­7, 2003), the Sixth International Bar Association International&#13;
Arbitration Day (held in Sydney on February 13, 2003), the Spring Meeting of&#13;
the American Bar Association Section of International Law and Practice (held&#13;
in Washington, D.C. on May 7­10, 2003), the Fourteenth Annual Workshop of&#13;
the Institute for Transnational Arbitration (held in Dallas on June 19, 2003),&#13;
the Thirty-Ninth Conference of the Inter-American Bar Association (held in&#13;
New Orleans on June 17­22, 2003), and an IFCAI Conference on Interim&#13;
Measures of Protection in International Commercial Arbitration (held in&#13;
Vienna on June 27, 2003).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The staff of the Centre also contributed lectures on ICSID at several universi-&#13;
ties including the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, the Universidad del&#13;
País Vasco, Duke University, McGill University, Turin University and King's&#13;
College London.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE&#13;
&#13;
ADMINISTRATIVE COUNCIL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Thirty-sixth Annual Meeting of the Administrative Council of the Centre&#13;
took place on September 29, 2002, in Washington, D.C., on the occasion of&#13;
the Annual Meetings of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank Group&#13;
and the International Monetary Fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
At the meeting, the Council approved the Centre's 2002 Annual Report and&#13;
its administrative budget for fiscal year 2003.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Council also adopted new amendments of the ICSID Regulations and&#13;
Rules and the Additional Facility Rules of the Centre. The amendments&#13;
streamlined the Additional Facility Rules in particular, clarified and updated&#13;
a number of provisions of the ICSID Regulations and Rules and of the&#13;
Additional Facility Rules, and made several others more flexible.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
The Resolutions adopted at the Meeting are set forth in Annex 5. The&#13;
amended ICSID Regulations and Rules and Additional Facility Rules are&#13;
available from the Centre in booklet form and are posted on the Centre's&#13;
website.&#13;

&#13;
FINANCE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Financial Statements of ICSID for fiscal year 2003 are set forth in Annex 6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The administrative expenditures of ICSID were, again, entirely covered by the&#13;
World Bank pursuant to the Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements&#13;
concluded between the Bank and ICSID in February 1967, and by income&#13;
from the sale of publications.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It was therefore not necessary to assess any excess expenditures on&#13;
Contracting States pursuant to Article 17 of the Convention.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Expenditures relating to pending arbitration proceedings are borne by the&#13;
parties in accordance with ICSID's Administrative and Financial Regulations.&#13;

&#13;
NOTE 1 ­ ORGANIZATION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre)&#13;
was established on October 14, 1966 to provide facilities for the conciliation&#13;
and arbitration of investment disputes between States and nationals of other&#13;
States. On February 13, 1967, the International Bank for Reconstruction&#13;
and Development (the Bank) and the Centre entered into Administrative&#13;
Arrangements which were effective as of the date of the establishment of&#13;
the Centre. The Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements (the&#13;
Memorandum) provides that, except to the extent that the Centre may be&#13;
reimbursed by the parties to proceedings for fees and expenses of members&#13;
of Conciliation Commissions, Arbitral Tribunals or ad hoc Committees, the&#13;
Bank shall provide facilities and services to the Centre, as described in Notes&#13;
2 and 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 ­ SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING&#13;
&#13;
POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation: The financial&#13;
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles&#13;
generally accepted in the United States of America and with International&#13;
Financial Reporting Standards. Such financial statements are presented&#13;
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 117,&#13;
"Financial Statements of Not-For-Profit-Organizations" (SFAS No. 117).&#13;
SFAS No. 117 requires that net assets are classified in accordance with donor&#13;
restrictions; however, there are no net assets as of June 30, 2003 and 2002.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with&#13;
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America&#13;
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the&#13;
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets&#13;
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported&#13;
amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual&#13;
results could differ from these estimates.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Cash Equivalents: The Centre considers all highly liquid debt investments&#13;
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equiv-&#13;
alents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Value of Services Provided by the Bank and In-Kind Contributions: In accor-&#13;
dance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 116, "Accounting&#13;
for Contributions Received and Contributions Made", the value of services&#13;
provided by the Bank is determined by the estimated fair value of these&#13;
services and is recorded by the Centre as in-kind contributions and also as&#13;
expenses of the Centre.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank provides support services and facilities to the Centre including the&#13;
following:&#13;
     (1) the services of staff members and consultants; and&#13;
     (2) other administrative services and facilities, such as travel,&#13;
           communications, office accommodations, furniture, equipment,&#13;
           supplies and printing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Revenue Recognition from Arbitration Proceedings: The Centre does not have&#13;
resources of its own. The Centre's direct expenses attributable to arbitration&#13;
proceedings are borne by the parties in accordance with the Centre's&#13;
Administrative and Financial Regulations (Regulations). In accordance with&#13;
these Regulations, the Secretary-General calls on the parties to make advance&#13;
deposits with the Centre from time to time to defray these anticipated&#13;
expenses. Accordingly, the Centre recognizes revenues from these exchange&#13;
transactions during the period of and to the extent of expenses incurred&#13;
related to arbitration proceedings. If, after the completion of an arbitration&#13;
proceeding, it is determined that there is a cash surplus, such surplus shall be&#13;
refunded to the parties in proportion to the amounts advanced by each party&#13;
to the Centre.&#13;

&#13;
Revenue earned by the Centre from the sale of publications and registration&#13;
fees is remitted to the Bank as partial reimbursement for the services pro-&#13;
vided by the Bank. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, the Centre started&#13;
the practice of charging an administrative fee equivalent to 8% of the total&#13;
amounts disbursed in cases where the parties involved in a dispute that does&#13;
not fall under the ICSID Convention or Additional Facility Rules request the&#13;
Centre to undertake the arrangements in connection with the proceeding. In&#13;
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002, the Centre started to charge an adminis-&#13;
trative fee of $2,000 for each case registered after January 1, 2001. In the&#13;
fiscal year ended June 2003, a fixed fee amount of $3,000 has been charged&#13;
for all ICSID cases registered after July 1, 2002. Such amounts are netted&#13;
against in-kind contributions in the accompanying statement of activities.&#13;

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To:      International Centre for Settlement&#13;
             of Investment Disputes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We have audited the accompanying statements of financial position of the International&#13;
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre) as of June 30, 2003 and 2002,&#13;
and the related statements of activities and cash flows for the years then ended. These&#13;
financial statements are the responsibility of the management of the International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development and of the Centre. Our responsibility is to express an&#13;
opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the&#13;
United States of America and with the International Standards on Auditing. Those&#13;
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about&#13;
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes&#13;
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the&#13;
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and&#13;
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial&#13;
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our&#13;
opinion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the&#13;
financial position of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes as of&#13;
June 30, 2003 and 2002, and the changes in its net assets and cash flows for the years then&#13;
ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of&#13;
America and with International Financial Reporting Standards.&#13;

            International Centre for Settlement of
            Investment Disputes (ICSID) 2003 annual report
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The past year was one of significant
            further growth for the International Centre for Settlement
            of Investment Disputes (ICSID). Five more countries joined
            the Centre. The caseload grew at a record-breaking pace:
            over 25 new arbitration cases were registered. They raised
            to 63 the number of cases pending under the ICSID Convention
            or ICSID Additional Facility Rules. Most of these cases were
            brought to ICSID under the numerous bilateral investment
            treaties that provide for the settlement of investment
            disputes by ICSID arbitration. Several of the cases were
            brought under multilateral treaties with similar provisions;
            these notably include the North American Free Trade
            Agreement (NAFTA). ICSID also continued the publications
            program that makes the Centre a leading source of
            information and analysis on foreign investment law.
            Partnerships with other arbitration institutions were
            enhanced by participation in the International Federation of
            Commercial Arbitration Institutions (IFCAI) and the
            publishing by ICSID of the IFCAI Newsletter. Staff
            presentations at arbitration conferences and seminars
            continued to be a further important means of disseminating
            knowledge about ICSID and its activities. Another highlight
            of the fiscal year was the adoption by the Administrative
            Council, on the proposal of the Secretariat, of new
            amendments of the ICSID Regulations and Rules and Additional
            Facility Rules. The amendments were the first made to the
            ICSID Regulations and Rules for almost 20 years and the
            first ever to the Additional Facility Rules. The resulting
            streamlining and updating of the Regulations and Rules
            should assist the Centre in the administration of its
            expanding caseload. Details of these and other developments
            for fiscal year 2003 comprise this report.  The Report also
            includes the audited financial statements of the Centre,
            presented pursuant to Administrative and Financial
            Regulation 19.
