Chapter 1: BACKGROUND AND LESSONS LEARNT&#13;
A. Macro Economic Background&#13;
1.1    Over the past 20 years, economic growth in Zambia has been amongst the lowest in&#13;
Africa. The standard of living of most Zambians has deteriorated sharply since its peak in the&#13;
early 1970s. These conditions have come about mainly due to worsening terms of trade, low&#13;
efficiency and decreasing levels of investment. Inefficiencies in the economy have been caused by&#13;
the dominance of parastatals and their capital/import - intensive strategies, price controls, and the&#13;
increasing share of public spending going to lvages. These have reduced public investment and the&#13;
efficiencv of public services. During the 1980's rural and urban incomes fell by 50 percent as&#13;
agriculture stagnated due to lack of incentives caused by price distortions and falling fornal sector&#13;
real wages. The government attempted several times to restructure the economy. The most&#13;
ambitious of these in 1985 - 87 was abandoned on the grounds that it generated excessive economic&#13;
and political instability and social unrest. The economy became more unstable between 1987 and&#13;
1989 with inflation rising from 35 percent in 1986 to 64 percent in 1988 and to 154 percent in&#13;
1989.&#13;
1.2    A new government was elected in 1991 and has committed itself to an ambitious economic&#13;
reform programme. The reforms include:&#13;
*  reduction of inflation;&#13;
*  privatization of parastatals;&#13;
&#149;  public sector reform;&#13;
*  promotion of free and open markets;&#13;
*  deregulation; and&#13;
* decentralization and devolution of government administration.&#13;
1.3    The government economic reform recognises that it must also relieve the social problems&#13;
that have accompanied the economic decline and lessen the impact on the most vulnerable of the&#13;
disruptions that accompany economic restructuring. The primary goals are to increase&#13;
employment; expand resources to improve health, education, and other basic social services; and&#13;
meet income and other needs of vulnerable members of society.&#13;
1.4    The overall objective of the Bank's assistance strategy in Zambia, as stated in the Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board in March 1994, has been to promote&#13;
sustainable economic growth and to reduce poverty by: (i) supporting macroeconomic stabilization&#13;
and structural reform policies; (ii) promoting private sector development and greater public sector&#13;
efficiency; and (iii) increasing targeted direct assistance to poor and vulnerable groups.&#13;
1.5    The economic stabilisation programme has stopped the practice of financing the&#13;
government deficit by borrowing from the Bank of Zambia ( i.e. printing money). Positive real&#13;
interest rates are charged and subsidies reduced. There has been a gradual disengagement from&#13;
agricultural sector marketing and spending on defense and paramilitary has been reduced to a&#13;
minimum. The foreign exchange market has been liberalised and improved budgetary planning,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
monitoring and control mechanisms have been introduced. Inflation for 1993 was reported as 140&#13;
percent (low income bracket) dropping to 27.3 percent from January up to September 1994.2&#13;
1.6    The Government is committed to privatization, deregulation and to a Public Sector&#13;
Reform Programme which includes improved human resource management and retrenchment. The&#13;
outcomes expected will be a more efficient service dclivery and a smaller civil service, more&#13;
responsive to the needs of the Zambian people. The Government is also committed to a policy of&#13;
decentralization and devolution.&#13;
1.7    The reforms as outlined above have succeeded in halting the economic slide, but they wvill&#13;
take time to reverse the impact of almost two decades of economic deterioration on living standards&#13;
and the extent of poverty. Given the large number of poor households in Zambia now, it is&#13;
inevitable that many reform policies could have adverse consequences until a return to broad&#13;
economic based growth is acihieved.&#13;
B. Poverty in Zambia&#13;
1.8    Poverty is now an issue in Zambia. Since the mid seventies Zambia per capita national&#13;
income and all the social indicators have fallen dramatically. In 1991, about 69 percent of all&#13;
Zambians were living in households with expcnditures that were below the level sufficient to&#13;
supply nutritional and basic needs. Fifty-five percent belong to the core poor category - unable to&#13;
meet basic nutritional needs only.3&#13;
1.9    Rural poverty, more prevalent and more severe than urban poverty, becomes worse in the&#13;
more remote areas, and increases with distance to food markets and major roads. Over 90 percent&#13;
of the rural population are engaged in subsistence farming, depend on marketing for a cash income,&#13;
and are thus sensitive to price changes and sudden shocks to the market. Rural incomes continue to&#13;
deteriorate as agricultural prices have not risen as fast as other prices, and food producers are&#13;
suffering as the reversals in long standing policies take effect. The constraints to economic&#13;
recovery for the rural poor include lack of credit to farmers, inability of farmers to respond to&#13;
prices, (poverty, illiteracy, lack of information); lack of basic services (health, education, water,&#13;
transport and sanitation), and inaccessibility of markets.&#13;
1.10   Strategies for the recovery of the rural cconomy includes the provision of credit, reliable&#13;
marketing information, community based and private market organisations, rehabilitation of roads&#13;
for the transport of inputs and outputs, improved storage facilities, improved water facilities, and&#13;
the strengthening of farmers' organisations to increase bargaining powver. The provision of&#13;
improved water facilities frees women's time more dramatically than any productive new&#13;
technology, and also encourages horticulture and livestock production.&#13;
1.11   Urban poverty is characterized by overcrowvding, insecurity and fear, fragmented social&#13;
networks, and poor access to services which even when available, are expensive. Urban poverty&#13;
was negligible in the 1970s (4 percent in 1975) but has increased to 50 percent of the urban&#13;
population in the 1990s. Zambia is highly urbanised with more than 45 percent of the population&#13;
living in urban centres. Most of the urban poor live in unplanned squatter settlements without legal&#13;

status or access to basic services. Vulnerability in urban areas is related to employment, the&#13;
potential for a sustainable livelihood, and to assets at the community and household level. Formal&#13;
employment has declined between 1980 and 1990 from 23.9 to 9.8 percent of the workforce with&#13;
unemployment rising to 20 pcrcent4 For those in work, there has been a decline in real eaming of&#13;
80 percent across sectors. Nearly 43 percent of the urban population work in the informal sector.&#13;
The average household size is increasing because of inadequate and poor access to housing. The&#13;
insecurity created by the absence of legality of tenure in squatter areas is resulting in lack of&#13;
investment or service provision in those areas - for example transport, water provision and energy.&#13;
The lack of public transport hinders access to income opportunities, constrains access to other&#13;
social services, results in diminishing retums to trade, and frustrates the expansion of markets and&#13;
distribution of goods. In illegal settlements, there is no water provision, while in low income areas&#13;
the standpipes service ratio is 1:25 households. There have been periodic outbreaks of cholera and&#13;
dysentery. Only 5 percent of households in poor compounds have access to electricity and almost&#13;
twenty eight percent of the core poor's non food expenditure is spent on light and cooking.5&#13;
1.12   Strategies for development of the urban areas have been identified as resolving legal issues&#13;
regarding illegal settlements and titling procedures; developing small scale enterprise including, for&#13;
example, commercial and minimalist credit programmes; improving urban transport; improving&#13;
access to services such as water, roads and education (by facilitating community project&#13;
identification and implementation processes); and providing appropriate education services which&#13;
educate for self employment and the informal sector.&#13;
1.13   Womcn in both rural and urban areas are the most vulnerable. A female headed household&#13;
is a good indicator of poverty, and the combination of female headship without the support of a&#13;
man or adult children guarantees poverty.6 Female headed households tend to have high&#13;
dependency ratios and are most likelv to be poor. The poor and poorly educated women have the&#13;
highest fertility rate (average 7.1 children as against 4.1 for their educated sisters), and rarely use&#13;
contraception, which leaves them in a poverty trap of high dependency rates and less income to&#13;
invest in education and health of their children. Indicators of rural women's limited access to&#13;
education include an illiteracy rate of fifty-five percent, and a 38 percent showing in completion&#13;
for the restricted number of day secondary school places. Women have limited access to land while&#13;
unmarried women are rarely recommended for allocation of land if they do not have children. The&#13;
children of the poor are less likely to attend school because they are engaged in farming and&#13;
informal sector activities and the opportunity costs for schooling are high. In urban areas, women&#13;
are increasingly participating in informal sector activities, but are generally in the low return areas&#13;
and earn less than men. The long distances and waiting periods to reach water are added burdens&#13;

1.14   The Poverty Assessment for Zambia identifies strategies which distinguish between&#13;
providing a safety net for the indigent poor and a poverty reducing growth strategy which will&#13;
benefit the non indigent but temporarily poor. For those that lack resources, but have the capacity&#13;
to help themselves, the objective of a safety net is to promote investment in human or physical&#13;
capital. A major asset of the poor is labour and it has been recommended that an emphasis should&#13;
be placed on delivery of a safety net through labour based programmes. There is a need for&#13;
community based implementation of a number of activities such as feeder roads, water supply&#13;

Government emphasises devolution of safety net activities to local groups and the need to ensure&#13;
that interventions are planned with the poor and implemented by the poor.&#13;
C. Sectoral Background&#13;
1.15   A report commissioned b) the World Bank7, showcd that there has been a substantial&#13;
decline in social indicators.. The report elaborated the many constraints to social service delivery.&#13;
These included:&#13;
(a) inadequate guiding policies in many areas especially concerning women in&#13;
development, youth, watcr, and sanitation;&#13;
(b) inappropriate institutional structures;&#13;
(c) limited community participation in the identification, formulation, implementation and&#13;
evaluation of projects; resulting in community priorities often remaining unidentified,&#13;
and commitment to many projccts absent;&#13;
(d) inadequate professional and technical personnel and logistical support to social service&#13;
delivery;&#13;
(e) poor regulatory framework in the social sectors as many laws are outdated and need&#13;
revision;&#13;
(f) lack of coordination among the actors in the social sectors; and&#13;
(g) poor communication facilities in many areas.&#13;
Education&#13;
1.16   Primary education is characterised bv falling enrollments (2 percent growvth against a&#13;
population growth of 3.2 percent ), high wastage, falling teacher pupil time and teacher pupil ratio,&#13;
severe overcrowding, complete deterioration of facilities, no desks and a poorly motivated teaching&#13;
force with few, if any, teaching materials available. Schools have inadequate water and toilet&#13;
facilities, and urban schools are often closed due to outbreaks of water borne diseases. The primary&#13;
education sector has been hit by the bias to secondary and tertiary education, few new schools have&#13;
been constructed to cope with the growth and a multi-shift system is used in most schools to&#13;
maximise the utility of classrooms and teachers. Trained teachers will only offer their services in&#13;
rural primary schools which provide accommodation. District Education officers rarely visit rural&#13;
schools to monitor teachers' performance because of lack of recurrent funds to pay for transport.&#13;
Access to primary school remains limited. The real and opportunity costs of education are&#13;
increasing and in urban areas the demand for school places far outstrips supply - (3,000 applicants&#13;
for 120 places is not unheard of in Lusaka). The Ministry of Education estimated in 19928 that by&#13;
1996, 4,114 extra teachers and 3,657 classrooms would be needed to just maintain the status quo.&#13;
1.17   Evidence shows that illiteracy is increasing, especially amongst women in rural areas. In&#13;
1990, 44 percent of rural 7 - 13 year olds wcerc actuallv attending school. wvhile in Lusaka, only 55&#13;

Healtl&#13;
1.18   Health indicators suggest a general downward trend in the health of Zambians. One in five&#13;
children born in Zambia dies before reaching age five.'° An average of 40 percent of children&#13;
between 12 and 24 months, with a greater prevalence in rural areas, show stunted growth,&#13;
indicative of chronic undernutrition. Iodine deficiency is a serious problem. AIDS is devastating&#13;
all sectors of soci oty, but more especially uneducated girls. Malaria continues to kill, and poor&#13;
access to sake water and sanitation has increased vulnerability to water borne diseases. Maternal&#13;
deaths and low birth wcights continuc to be high. Vaccination rates are falling to an overall low of&#13;
54.8 percent.&#13;
1.19   Although the downwvard trend of budgetary allocations to health has been reversed since&#13;
1991, reaching 13 percent in 1994, the existing health infrastructure has been left severely&#13;
dilapidated and access to health facilities, the quality of services, ava:lability of drugs and supplies&#13;
vary widely between rural and urban areas, as well as between poor and non poor areas. Health&#13;
staff are concentrated along the line of rail and in urban centers while rural health centers remain&#13;
uiiderstaffed. The Ministry of Health is committed to health reforms which focus on reorganization&#13;
of the Zambian health care system from one of overcentralisation to a decentralised district focus in&#13;
order to respond more effectively to today's health needs. Reforms being put in place are in the&#13;
areas of managerient and accountability, community participation, public/private partnerships and&#13;
human resource development. Strengthening the management of health services within the district&#13;
is regarded as the crux of the health reforms. The health centre has been identified as the key&#13;
contact point for households and patients to health care. This Centre will provide simple diagnosis&#13;
and treatments, but will require improved means of communication and expansion and&#13;
rehabilitation of existing facilities in terms of equipment, materials and staff. The 1007 health&#13;
centers and 100 hospitals of varying sizes need substantial funds if they are to achieve these modest&#13;
aims.&#13;
Water and Sanitation&#13;
1.20   Only 66 percent of Zambian urban dwellers and 47 percent of rural population have access&#13;
to safe water.1  During the last decade there has been increasing numbers of outbreaks of water&#13;
born diseases with over 40,000 cases of dysentery between June 1990 - 1993 and 15,000 clinical&#13;
cases of cholera between November 1992 - March 1993. Although most of the urban population&#13;
lives within one kilometer of a piped water supply, breakdowns and poor pressure, long queues,&#13;
and contaminated water are the norm. In rural areas the long walking distances and waiting times&#13;
for obtaining water represent a major demand on women's time. Only one in five Zamnbians have&#13;
access to a flush toilet. while one in three have no sanitation facilities at all.'2 The lack of a&#13;
comprehensive policy on water and sanitation and the lack of coordination between the several&#13;
ministries responsible and the numerous donors have been identified as key constraints to&#13;
improving water delivery.&#13;

1.21   A Community Mobilisation Monitoring Unit (CMMU) has been established in the&#13;
Ministrv of Energy and Water Development whose role it is to ensure that water technologies are&#13;
appropriate and consistent with the local culture; the development of safe water resources has a&#13;
cost sharing component wvhich is affordable for low income consumers; there is an accelerated&#13;
rehabilitation programme and consultation wvith consumers at all levels of decision-making in ord 2r&#13;
to promote the community participation necessary for maintenance and sustainability of water&#13;
supplies. WASHE (Water and Sanitation Health Education ) technical committees have been set up&#13;
which are based in the districts and coordinate water projects.&#13;
Nutrition and Household Food Security&#13;
1.22   Malnutrition is the leading cause of death among children. 40 percent of children under 5&#13;
years old are stunted; 25 percent are underveight for their age; 5 percent are wasted."3 The more&#13;
remote provinces showv a higher incidence of chronic malnutrition. The areas showing the worst&#13;
nutritional status are those with either a poorly developed road netwvork or those in the rift valley&#13;
areas. Within a district, the worst nutritional status is found in peripheral areas of the district.'4&#13;
Malnutrition in rural areas shoNvs a higher incidence in households with high household&#13;
dependency rates and a young mother. In urban areas, malnutrition is linked to incomes levels and&#13;
education of the mother. The NFNC analysis of the PS I data shows that the urban households&#13;
which have the lowest levels of food security arc large, with high dependency rates, uneducated&#13;
heads of households and high levels of unemplorment (formal sector).&#13;
1.23   The sectors which should address and have an impact on nutrition and household food&#13;
security are agriculture, health. education and cconomic infrastructure.&#13;
Economic Infrastructiure&#13;
1.24   All sources agree that poverty and many indicators of poverty are directly correlated with&#13;
accessibility and distance to markets and urban centres. Remote areas of Zambia and the rift&#13;
valleys do not receive adequate social services, production inputs or marketing opportunities and&#13;
information. Food availability becomes scarce seasonally because the roads are either impassable&#13;
or badly dilapidated. Rural District Councils have failed to maintain these rural roads due to lack&#13;
of recurrent funds and equipment. In urban areas, the state of the roads discourages public&#13;
transporters, making transport either non existent or very expensive, which in turn constrains&#13;
economic activity.&#13;
1.25   The changes in maize marketing policv have had a major effect in rural areas. Rural&#13;
producers have not developed either on-farm or community-based storage capacity due to the&#13;
government marketing policies. The liberalisation of trading has resulted in an explosion of petty&#13;
traders and marketeers, and urban areas are now characterised by pavement sellers. The Municipal&#13;
and District Councils are devolving the management of markets to the marketeers themselves.&#13;

1.26   The major causes of deforestation are urban fuel wood demand in Central, Copperbelt,&#13;
Lusaka and Southe -n Provinces, (39000 ha/annum) and agriculture (20 percent of forests have&#13;
been converted). Soil fertility is declining in areas which practice slash and burn agriculture&#13;
(chitemene) and li-estock stocking rates are more than double recommended rates. Mono-cropping&#13;
maize has led to deterioration of soil structure and loss of biological diversity. Poaching has&#13;
devastated wild ar.imal populations.&#13;
1.27   Urban seflements are unplanncd and the Councils are unable to provide essential services.&#13;
The increas.ng volumes of garbage dumped in residential areas and inadequate sanitation and&#13;
waste disposal facilities in urban areas is leading to increasing outbreaks of disease and pollution.&#13;
1.28   The National Environmental Action Plan details a strategy for improvement which&#13;
recommends: environmental planning be integrated into the development process through the&#13;
inclusion of environmental impact assessment of all development programmes in excess of&#13;
US$250,000; a property rights reform and privatisation be instituted; decentralisation, with&#13;
community involvement and participation in the planning process. Tree planting, soil conservation,&#13;
fuel wood plantations, water conservation with small dams and conservation education are among&#13;
some of the other recommended actions. 15&#13;
D. Institutional Background&#13;
1.29   The consequences of lack of coordination between donors, sectors, programmes and&#13;
projects is most felt by the very people these programmes are supposed to serve. The Government&#13;
of Zambia has recognized this problem and adopted a decentralisation policy. Both the Ministry of&#13;
Health and Ministry of Local Government and Housing have taken steps to decentralise decision&#13;
making to district level. The Ministry of Education also intends to restructure with particular&#13;
emphasis on the transfer of certain management functions to education boards at schools, colleges&#13;
and districts.&#13;
1.30   In order to improve coordination at district level, a-id encourage local government to be&#13;
more accountable to the people it serves, the Ministry of Local Government and Housing has&#13;
committed itself to an ambitious programme of decentralisation and limited devolution. District&#13;
Councils will establish District Development Coordinating Committees (DDCC) in each district.&#13;
The DDCC will be responsible for ensuring that the district plan - eventually both capital and&#13;
recurrent programmes of the sectoral ministries - answers the priority needs of the district and its&#13;
population. The sector ministries at district level will be represented on the DDCC. The District&#13;
Council will be expected to employ a district planner who will assist in the district planning&#13;
process, and appraise and monitor projects in the district. Eventually, it is possible that the DDCC&#13;
system could enable participatory bottom up planning for both the capital and the recurrent&#13;
budgets available to the different sectors. While the education and health sectors, public welfare&#13;
assistance, PAM, MPU and others have committed themselves to decentralisation of decision&#13;
making, there remains a need for these groups to coordinate and network their activities if&#13;
improved coordination is to be achieved. The described institutional changes will facilitate this&#13;

(a) Social Recovery Fund&#13;
1.32   Microprojects Unit: the Microprojects Unit (MPU) is based in the National Commission&#13;
for Development Planning. The MPU was created in August 1991 when the World Bank/GRZ&#13;
Social Recovery Project joined forces with the European Union (EU) Microprojects Programme.&#13;
The MPU is administered as one unit sharing staff, systems, procedures and criteria. The MPU is&#13;
essentially a financing agency which appraises, finances and monitors the implementation of small-&#13;
scale community based projects. The target group for the MPU is non incapacitated poor, in rural&#13;
and urban areas. The gro%Nth in the activities and numbers of projects funded by the MPU has been&#13;
substantial. The administrative capacitv of the&#13;
MPU allows for a maximum number of 540        Figure 2: SRF Disbursements by Sector&#13;
projects under implementation at anv one time.           December 1994&#13;
or an average of 60 projects per province. By&#13;
September 1994, funds had been disbursed to&#13;
584 microprojects at an averagc rate of&#13;
US$965,000 per quarter. Micro-projects              hnfra   Water Credit&#13;
include the construction and rehabilitation of H ealth&#13;
schools, classrooms, rural health clinics; safe&#13;
water supplies; sanitation; markets and rural&#13;

Fu id of US$20 million will be fully committed by February 1995, one year ahead of schedule. 75&#13;
percent of the project credit had been disbursed by 31st December 1994. The balance of US$4.5&#13;
million si ould adequately cover: (i) all on-going sub-projects; and (ii) MPU incremental costs to&#13;
completion date. D onors such as the Government of Finland and Norway have recognised the&#13;
potential of the MPU for development and have also contributed to the Fund.&#13;
1.33   The Government of Zambia has become more committed to the SRP as the effectiveness of&#13;
the MPU in the implementation of social sector rehabilitation projects has been demonstrated. In&#13;
1994, the total budget counterpart funding - K180 million (US$240,000) - was released to the SRP&#13;
before the year er.d. The allocation for 1995 is K415 million (US$550,000) of which K361 million&#13;
(US$240,OCO) had been released by April 30. Considerable governmmnt support for MPU activities&#13;
at district and provincial level has been forthcoming in the form of sectoral involvement in the desk&#13;
and field appraisal committees and increased monitoring. Technical staff have taken greater&#13;
interest and responsibi.ity for monitoring technical aspects of micro-projects, and assisting the&#13;
communities in their implementation. As district staff understand and are better informed of the&#13;
MPU procedures, they are giving more appropriate advice to communities and apply the skills&#13;
learnt to other capital nrojects in the district. The Provincial Permanent Secretaries and the&#13;
Provincial Planning Units are also taking a more active role in MPU projects.&#13;
1.34   Strengths and weaknesses in the         Figure 3: No. of Projects by Province&#13;
current Social Recovery Fund in Zambia have              December 1994&#13;
been identified through several external&#13;
evaluations: - a Technical Audit; a Technical&#13;
Evaluation; three Beneficiary Assessments;&#13;
and a Management Audit, (available on Project          North          Luapula&#13;
files). These evaluations considered the quality&#13;
of the micro-projects; the project designs;                _i                Nst&#13;
implementation procedures used; the capacity  Lusaka&#13;
of the communities to implement self-help&#13;
projects; the extent to which the micro-project&#13;
met the community priority needs; the impact                                   Certral&#13;
of the micro-projects; the efficacy of the     CBeIt&#13;
project cycle; its disbursement procedures; ,&#13;
and the general administration of the MPU.                                 West&#13;
The overall assessment of these evaluations is       S  h&#13;
that there can be little doubt that the SRF has      South&#13;
been very successful in assisting communities&#13;
to acquire valuable new facilitics of which they are justifiably proud. Procedures and systems are&#13;
well developed, and the establishment of a Regional Officer network has been valuable in ensuring&#13;
that projects are implemented in a timely and technically sound manner. The evaluations agreed,&#13;
however, that there is need for the SRF to pay particular attention to increasing community&#13;
capacity to implement and manage their projects. The assessment also identified a need to pay&#13;
more attention to pre-project identification processes. A third area of development identified by the&#13;
mid-term review is the need to clarify and strengthen the role and involvement of line ministries in&#13;
Microproject unit activities.&#13;

(b) Survey Component&#13;
1.35   A major problem facing agencies implementing social sector and poverty alleviation&#13;
programmes is the lack of up to date usable information from which to identify and prioritize the&#13;
target groups, and to appraise and evaluate ongoing interventions.&#13;
1.36   The SRP component based at CSO has completed Priority Surveys 1 and 2, (PS1 and&#13;
PS2) as well as a community survey. Priority Survey I data were made available to users by the&#13;
middle of 1993, were published in November 1993 and a dissemination workshop held.&#13;
The PS 2 data wvere presented in draft tabulations in 1994, some analysis was completed in early&#13;
1995, and a statistical abstract produced in March. The community survey is currently being&#13;
analysed.&#13;
1.37   An evaluation of the survey component of the SRP was carried out during October and&#13;
November of 199416 The evaluation report recognizes that comprehensive data sets have been&#13;
produced and made available on a number of variablcs relevant for poverty analyses. The CSO&#13;
has been strengthened in the area of Social Statistics, and data processing capacities have been&#13;
enhanced. The training component of the program has been very successful. Provincial staff are&#13;
now able to enter collected data on their computers which were installed by the project in 1992.&#13;
Short-term and long-term training overseas have also been successful. Nine statisticians from the&#13;
CSO have benefited from this training.&#13;
1.38   The evaluation mission has recommended a continuation of the program into a second&#13;
phase, provided a number of adjustments are implemented. These adjustments concern:&#13;
* a refocusing of the surveys towvards the social sphere of living conditions&#13;
*  user-producer workshops to identify information needs&#13;
*  application of a smaller and more manageable sample&#13;
*  more appropriate questionnaire&#13;
*  improved routines for quality control in the field&#13;
*  long-term technical assistance to secure continuity&#13;
* attention to the need to secure continuitv and consistency with data already established&#13;
through PS I and PS 11&#13;
*  increased coordination of social statistics monitoring within the CSO&#13;
*  better advertising of data availability.&#13;
1.39   Following the drought of 1991/92, the Drought Indicator Monitoring System (DIMS) was&#13;
set up in Central Statistics Office to monitor the effects of drought on households and communities&#13;
in 27 districts. In March 1993, DIMS wvas changed into a permanent Household Food Security,&#13;
Nutrition and Health Monitoring System ( FHANIS), funded mainly by GRZ and FAO. The&#13;
overall objective is to strengthen the capacity to monitor and analyse the food security, nutritional&#13;
status and health conditions at individual and household level. FHANIS produces a monthly report&#13;
which is presented to a Technical Committee for analysis and recommendations which is in turn&#13;
presented to the Steering Committee of policy makers. If the data showvs districts wvith problems,&#13;
Rapid Rural Appraisal teams based in the Provinces with different government institutions are sent&#13;

to iivestigate further. The lesson learncd here is that rapid analysis and dissemination of data is&#13;
essential for effective inputs to policy makers.&#13;
1.40   The Housel old Budget Survey started collecting data in July 1993 in order to produce&#13;
weights for the Consumer Prices Index; to provide household consumption expenditure for the&#13;
national accounts, distribution estimates of annual consumption across households to enable a&#13;
poverty datum line to be developed, and information about consumption of own produce and&#13;
consumption patterns. Both FHANIS and HBS benefit from long-term technical assistance,&#13;
ensuring consistency of external inputs.&#13;
1.41   The Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS), 1992 collected and analysed data&#13;
on maternal and child health. The main lcssons learned were to ensure a focused questionnaire and&#13;
a reasonable sample size. The use of teams which inputted and checked data while still in the field&#13;
speede(C up implementation and improved the quality of the data. User involvement ensured&#13;
relevance of the data collected. The FHANIS was collected very quickly, and has used extensively&#13;
quick reporting to ensure timcly disscmination of data.&#13;
(c) Study Fund (Policy Related Studies)&#13;
1.42   The Study Fund aims to support the analysis of existing data on social and poverty issues.&#13;
Analysis is action orientated, and involves planners and programme implementors. The Social&#13;
Recoverv Project acts as the secretariat to the Study Fund Committee, which approves and&#13;
sometimes commissions studies.&#13;
1.43   As part of SRP 1, the Study Fund supported 27 studies, of which 22 were completed, in the&#13;
health, education, community development, agricultural production, urban poverty and housing&#13;
sectors, (See Appendix I to annex 4 for List of Completed and Ongoing Studies). Most of these&#13;
studies used existing data, many PS I and 2. The results have been disseminated to policy makers,&#13;
implementors and other researchers. The Study Fund has assisted the Poverty Assessment for&#13;
Zambia by providing local coordination and organization. It is also assisting with coordination and&#13;
funding of the analysis of PS2 and the dissemination of the results.&#13;
1.44   The Study Fund component wvas evaluated by the SRP during the mid term review in May&#13;
1994. In summary, the evaluation found that the Study Fund has made major progress in&#13;
building up viable structures and procedures which ensure the operation of policy related and&#13;
action oriented research. The Study Fund administration and the Study Fund Committee have put&#13;
in place mechanisms of selection and revicwv of studies which are crucial to the project component.&#13;
Guidelines and a Research Manual (availablc on Project Files) have been produced which have&#13;
improved both the quality of the proposals and the ensuing research. Additionally, there has been&#13;
an improvement in communication between the research community policy makers and&#13;
implementors, and dialogue initiated on thc development of appropriate strategies.&#13;
1.45   The evaluation noted that public institutions and ministries should become more involved&#13;
in the concept and the operation of the Study Fund to the extent that policy makers and programme&#13;
implementors commission the research they need. The evaluation recommended that the Study&#13;
Fund Secretariat needs to reinforce the review procedures and methodological support to the&#13;
researchers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

1.46   The Study Fund component of SRP I commissioned a Beneficiary Assessment Team&#13;
(BAT) and provided training in qualitative data collection as well as some infrastructure, (vehicles&#13;
and computers). BAT monitored and evaluated ongoing SRP Microproject activities from the&#13;
beneficiary's viewpoint. Qualitative data were collected at regular intervals and results were&#13;
quickly and readily available to develop SRP I interventions, improve procedures and systems.&#13;
Consequently, the beneficiaries are better able to access and use the funds provided under the&#13;
community initiatives component, and their needs are better met. The Beneficiary Assessments&#13;
have been utilised by other donor agencies, NGOs and GRZ, and in some cases BAT has been&#13;
contracted to conduct similar evaluations of other programmes (e.g. UNICEF, EC, MPP). The&#13;
Beneficiary Assessment team also undertook the Participatory Poverty Assessment for Zambia, the&#13;
results of which formed Volume 3 of the Poverty Assessment for Zambia.&#13;
1.47   Use of qualitative data collection and participatory, rapid rural or urban appraisals are&#13;
becoming more common. Many NGOs and church groups as well as Ministries are monitoring the&#13;
living conditions of the population, identifying priority problems, and implementing specific fact&#13;
finding missions.&#13;
(d) Other Government Social Sector Programmes&#13;
1.48   The Social Action Programme, conceived through dialogue with Government in the latter&#13;
part of 1990, established working groups chaired by the relevant line ministries for each sector,&#13;
and including government, non governmental organizations and donor representatives. The working&#13;
groups were to analyze the needs of the sector and identify programmes or projects within each&#13;
sector which would help ease the plight of the poor. However, terms of reference for the working&#13;
groups were never clear, and implementation was weak, mainly due to lack of criteria for project&#13;
identification, sclection and targeting of vulnerable groups. The system for monitoring and&#13;
evaluation was also poor. As a result, SAP funds have been largely disbursed without any&#13;
targeting, clear priorities, monitoring, reporting or evaluation.&#13;
1.49   The Social Sector Task Force, was established in March 1993, with sub task forces,&#13;
supported by technical secretariats. The task forces included education, health and nutrition, water&#13;
and sanitation and social safety nets. The Provincial Permanent Secretary is the Chairperson of the&#13;
Provincial Social Sector Task Force which is responsible for monitoring and reporting on all&#13;
projects in the Province. Similarly, Council Secretaries are the Chairpersons of the District Social&#13;
Sector Task Forces charged with monitoring and reporting district projects to the Provincial&#13;
committee. No clear guidelines on what to monitor nor how to report have been given and there are&#13;
wide variations between provinces and districts.&#13;
1.50   The Social Safety Net task force was charged with coordinating a social safety net for&#13;
Zambia. Government funds were to be made available to it to disperse to NGOs and other actors in&#13;
the social safety net. The problems encountercd were lack of monitoring information upon which to&#13;
base criteria and evaluate cffcctiveness of interventions, lack of government funding, and lack of&#13;
implementation and reporting procedures.&#13;
1.51   The Public Welfare Assistance Scheme was established under the Ministry of Community&#13;
Development and Social Services. The target group is the chronically helpless. During the drought&#13;
of 1991/2, welfare committecs were set up in each district. consisting of NGOs, church groups,&#13;
line ministries and district council to determine who qualifies for assistance, which was mainly in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
the form of free maize. The Ministry of Community Development is planning an evaluation of this&#13;
scheme so that targeting of the programme can be improved.&#13;
1.52   The goverrment responded to the drought of 1991/2 by setting up the Programme to&#13;
Prevent Malnutrition (PPM). Programme Against Malnutrition (PAM), an NGO, was specifically&#13;
set up to deal with implementation. Area PPM committees were set up to develop policy and solve&#13;
problems related to food relief in their areas and identify those communities in need. A lead NGO&#13;
then took over the distribution and, based on community assessments, food for sale, food for work&#13;
or free food was made available. Food for Work programmes aimed at improving local&#13;
infrastructure we; e organised. One of the main constraints to PAM was the lack of up to date&#13;
information as to how many people would need assistance and how much they would need. Very&#13;
little targeting and vulnerability information existed.' The PUSH programme assists urban based&#13;
communities with food for work programmes. The beneficiaries are mostly women who receive a&#13;
basic food package in return for wvorking on urban based infrastructure.&#13;
1.53   There have been some misgivings regarding the food for work programmes related to the&#13;
technical auality and the sustainability of the infrastructure created using food for work; the&#13;
targeting mechanisms used; the effects on production, prices and marketing mechanisms; and the&#13;
long term effects on beneficiaries in terms of dependency. An evaluation is presently being done by&#13;
a 3RZ multidisciplinary team, representing different government ministries, funded by SRP 1. The&#13;
results of this evaluation will determine policy and budget allocations for 1995.&#13;
1.54   The experiences show that community based projects are successful given certain&#13;
conditions. District involvement in decision making is essential to ensure coordination at the&#13;
community level and district committees must be willing and able to assist in the targeting of the&#13;
different programmes. Monitoring information is needed but is often lacking for targeting and&#13;
evaluation purposes. The most important condition however, is for the project to have arisen as a&#13;
direct demand from the community to remedy a perceived need. Programmes fail where&#13;
community demand is absent, and there are neither developed criteria for the funding of the&#13;
projects, nor systems and procedures for implementation and reporting.&#13;

Chapter 2: THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives and Summary Description&#13;
2.1    Objectives. The aim of the Project is to assist the Government of Zambia's poverty&#13;
reduction program through financing of community initiatives and building of capacity for poverty&#13;
analysis and mon'toring. The project will finance community initiatives which assist the poor and&#13;
vulnerable t meet their owvn objectives during the adjustment period and thereby allow faster&#13;
economic and social recovery. The community-based micro-projects will include the rehabilitation&#13;
and improvement of existing infrastructure and social service delivery. The Project will also&#13;
improve the capacity of communities and government staff to plan, appraise, manage and maintain&#13;
investment projects through the experience gained in such micro-projects. The Project will also&#13;
enhance the capacity of Zambian institutions to collect and analyze poverty related data. The&#13;
beneficiary communities will be involved in the information gathering as well as in the planning,&#13;
design anci implementation of the micro-projects. The Project will strengthen the communities'&#13;
ability to take charge of their owvn development, rekindle the spirit of self help, and strengthen the&#13;
capacities of the relevant institutions to gather, analyze and act on relevant information.&#13;
2.2    Summary Project Description. In order to achieve these objectives, The Project will have&#13;
three components:&#13;
(a) Community Initiatives (75 percent of total project costs) which will finance&#13;
microprojects identified, prepared and implemented by communities with appraisal and&#13;
supervision from the MPU; a sub-component will finance capacity building in micro-&#13;
projects implementation and decentralized government agencies;&#13;
(b) Poverty Monitoring (5.7 percent of total project cost), which will finance capacity&#13;
building and data collection through a Living Conditions Monitoring Survey (LCMS)&#13;
and a systematic participatory monitoring and assessment system;&#13;
(c) Poverty Analysis (2.3 percent of total project cost), which will finance policy relevant&#13;
research on poverty and social issues in a demand-driven framework, building on the&#13;
success of the Study Fund under SRP 1.&#13;
2.3    All the components are based on the experience gathered under SRP 1 (see Chapter 1), with&#13;
appropriate revisions as identified by the various independent evaluations and mid term review. As&#13;
a condition of effectiveness for the IDA Credit, the Government will have disbursed at least half&#13;
of the 1995 budget allocation for the Social Recovery Project to the MPU.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
B. Detailed Project Description&#13;
Community Initiatives Component&#13;
2.4    Administration of the community initiatives component of the Project will be based in the&#13;
MPU and will build on the sound foundations and experiences of the SRP 1. The component will&#13;
finance micro-projects wvhich are small, simple and locally generated. The micro-projects must&#13;
meet a priority need of the majority of the community applying for the micro-project, and must&#13;
have a substantial (usually 25 percent) community contribution. The micro-projects will serve the&#13;
poor and vulnerable and will support govemment policy within each sector. The program will&#13;
remain demand-led but will aim through different initiatives described below to diversify the micro-&#13;
project portfolio so that a wider array of possible needs could be met.&#13;
Targeting&#13;
2.5   In order to better target the poor and vulnerable with micro project interventions, the MPU&#13;
will make increased use of participatory monitoring and assessment through a newly formed NGO,&#13;
the Participatory Assessment Group ( PAG); the results from the Living Conditions Monitoring&#13;
Surveys; and the analyses provided by the Study Fund through the SRP Coordinating Committee.&#13;
The PAG will (i) conduct regular site surveillance to monitor poverty issues; (ii) carry out&#13;
Beneficiary Assessments of micro-projects; (iii) assist in district level training in participatory&#13;
techniques, to strengthen the district involvement and capacity for identifying vulnerable&#13;
communities; and, (iv) interact ivith vulnerable communities to sensitise and assist in articulation of&#13;
their priorities and requirements for interventions. The results of the LCMS and the Study Fund&#13;
analyses will assist in the identification of specific geographical areas and communities where&#13;
extreme poverty is present. The MPU will remain demand led and will consolidate and improve&#13;
further the rigorous procedures of application and appraisal which ensure that only poor and&#13;
vulnerable communities benefit from the micro-project interventions. Communities which are&#13;
recognised by the district team as being more poor and vulnerable wvill take priority in the project&#13;
selection process of Desk Appraisal. Communities which are more willing to contribute, signifying&#13;
a priority need and commitment to projects, wvill also score higher in the selection process. Even&#13;
with this appraisal process, the MPU recognises that there may be core poor persons within a&#13;
community ( widows, female headed houscholds Avith dependents, orphans and disabled) who may&#13;
not benefit directly from interventions specifically aimed towards their community's needs. The&#13;
Public Welfare Assistance Scheme, UNICEF and other agencies are targeting interventions&#13;
specifically for these groups, thus assisting them to participate in and benefit indirectly from the&#13;
community targeted interventions. Before the mid-term review, as a measure of the effectiveness of&#13;
thcse targeting processes, the Studv Fund will finance a study of microproject interventions against&#13;
a background of geographical communitv/district/provincial poverty indicators derived from&#13;
surveys.&#13;
Sectors of Intervention&#13;
2.6    Within the health sector, the MPU will complement and coordinate its activities with the&#13;
health reform program. The MPU has developed tried and tested procedures for community based&#13;
micro-projects. Where the district health boards are intending themselves to fund community-based&#13;
initiatives, the MPU will assist them with these micro-project procedures. Where communities&#13;
apply for health micro-projects to the MPU, district health boards w%ill be asked to appraise and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
mcnitor the micro-projects. Coordination w ill take place at district and community levels. The&#13;
Project may fund the rehabilitation, extension and equipping of both rural and urban health centers,&#13;
including staff housing where this is inadequate. New constructions of Health Centers will only be&#13;
funded where the C istrict Health Board has agreed on the site, guaranteed availability of qualified&#13;
staff, and has assumed responsibilitv for thc recurrent costs of drug delivery and staff salaries. All&#13;
health infrastructr re rehabilitation micro-projects will have a water and sanitation component as&#13;
well as equipment, including lighting, where necessary. The MPU will follow any directives from&#13;
the Ministry of Health regarding changes in design or equipment of rural and urban health centers.&#13;
2.7    The education sector is likely to continue to benefit significantly from support&#13;
administered by the MPU. The need for rehabilitation and extension of primary schools is still a&#13;
priority and parents are willing to contribute substantially to the micro-projects. The MPU will&#13;
continue its primary school rehabilitation and extension program, provision of water and sanitation&#13;
faciliti s, and supply of school firniture. It is likely that remote rural schools will benefit by an&#13;
upgrading from pole and thatch buildings with no trained teachers, to proper classrooms with&#13;
housing to attract trained teachers. Large urban schools wvill be transformed from having&#13;
vandalized and overcr-wded classrooms, with no sanitation to speak of, into institutions with&#13;
adequate space, fumiture, lighting and improved sanitation facilities. The improvement in teachers'&#13;
and pupils' environments will enhance the morale of both and hence increase the effectiveness of&#13;
rural and urban schools. Schools rchabilitated under the SRP I are being maintained by the Parents&#13;
Teachers Association and a sense of pride and ownership has been engendered. The MPU will&#13;
insist that a maintenance committee is set up and functioning before any micro-project is funded.&#13;
2.8    Micro-projects in the areas of vocational training and technical skills training will be&#13;
eligible for financing under the Project. A training proposal may be a component of an&#13;
infrastructure micro-project, or it may be a discrete micro-project on its owvn. For example, there&#13;
may be a training component to a well construetion micro-project which would include primary&#13;
health care, pump maintenance and community organization. There could also be a well digger&#13;
training micro-project proposal. The central principle is that the Project will fund training only if it&#13;
is community based and meets a priority need for the participating community. Training will&#13;
usually be for a discrete length of time (c.g. 10 days), and both subject matter and training&#13;
curriculum must meet GRZ and MPU priorities. Some examples of what might be funded include&#13;
on-farm storage, well-digging; sanitation; functional literacy; primary health and nutritional&#13;
training; barefoot veterinarians: cattle club workshops; preventative maintenance workshops;&#13;
financial management workshops; marketing; horticulture (especially for women); and trainer of&#13;
trainers in any of the above. Training would be provided through the relevant government&#13;
department or by utilising other locally available expertise, and expenditures in the provision of&#13;
workshops, etc. could be supported.&#13;
2.9    In the water and sanitation sector both rural and urban communities are eligible for&#13;
financing. Water is a key priority, especially for wvomen as evidenced by the results of the Poverty&#13;
Assessment. Under the Project, the MPU will continue to insist that social sector facilities should&#13;
have a water and sanitation component as part of the micro-project. The project will also aim to&#13;
increase its inputs to the water and sanitation sector by sensitization at district workshops and the&#13;
development of community planning. Coordination with local District Water and Sanitation Health&#13;
Education Committees will continue so that micro-projects identified in the water and sanitation&#13;
sector comply with the district prioritized water plan and thus fall within the relevant ministry&#13;
plans. Use of NGOs as intermediaries working in the water and sanitation sector may continue.&#13;
Water micro-projects will continue to have a health education component as well as training for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
maintenance of the facility and insistence on the establishment of a community maintenance&#13;
committee with a cost sharing function. Micro-projects may include the rehabilitation and&#13;
expansion of water supply systems, where the technology is simple, appropriate and cost effective&#13;
to maintain. In the rural areas, simple hand dug wells with windlass and bucket, or boreholes where&#13;
the water table is very deep, may be funded while in urban areas, rehabilitation and expansion of&#13;
community based water systems will be funded.&#13;
2.10   The Project may finance community-based economic infrastructure improve-ment and&#13;
rehabilitation. In rural areas, remoteness and inaccessibility are correlated with poverty and chronic&#13;
food insecurity. In these areas, the Project may fund rehabilitation or reconstruction of earth&#13;
surface rural roads which will improve access to markets and facilitate social service delivery. The&#13;
Project may also fund bridges, markets, solar lighting plants for clinics and schools, community&#13;
based grain banks, rehabilitation and expansion of communal irrigation systems and cattle club&#13;
facilities for small scale farmers. In urban areas, community priorities are likely to be peri-urban&#13;
road rehabilitation, market construction, and waste disposal. In appraising such interventions the&#13;
project will seek the guidance and involvement of appropriate expertise from Government and other&#13;
agencies.&#13;
2. I1   The environment is also a high priority for the Government of Zambia as outlined in the&#13;
recently completed Environmental Action Plan.'8 The Project may finance community based soil&#13;
conservation schemes, tree nurseries, reforestation micro-projects and community training. Here&#13;
too, sources of expertise outside the project wvill be utilised.&#13;
2.12   Credit or revolvingfunds will be made available to rural women and those made&#13;
redundant by the Public Sector Reform Programme. The Project will build on the experience the&#13;
credit and revolving funds wl'hich operated under SRPI. Improvements will be made to the&#13;
procedures and criteria for funding. There will also be an insistence on a savings element to all&#13;
credit projects before consideration for funding. Training in financial and business management&#13;
will form an automatic component of any credit project. Procedures for releasing the revolving&#13;
funds to beneficiarics will be developed and submitted to IDA for approval before use.&#13;
2.13   The Project will be a major player in developing safety net activ-ities. Micro-projects&#13;
which would help provide safety net services will be given priority within the sectors described&#13;
above. Such micro-projects wVould include grain banks in food deficit areas; intensive labor works&#13;
for remote, rural, poorlv accessible and chronically food insecure areas; micro-projects specifically&#13;
targeted to women; and urban based skills training micro-projects. Through the MPU Steering&#13;
committee, the Project will coordinate its interventions in this sector wvith other agencies active in&#13;
the provision of social safety nets such as PAM, PUSH, and other NGOs.&#13;
Component Management - The Microprojects Unit (MPU)&#13;
2.14   The community initiatives component will be based in the MPU, an autonomous unit&#13;
within the NCDP. The Unit reports to the Perrnanent Secretarv for Economic Cooperation. The&#13;
MPU, in its current form, was created in August 1991, when the SRP joined forces with the EU&#13;
Microprojects Program. Since then, other donors and projects (Finland, Nonvay, Zambia&#13;
I National Environmental Action Plan. Ministry of Environment and National Resources, June&#13;
1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project) have appraised the MPU's efficiency and capacity for project&#13;
implementation and have channeled money through the unit. Microprojects are identified, appraised&#13;
and moni.ored by the same criteria, procedures, systems, and staff irrespective of the funding&#13;
source. Assurance. will be souight from Government at negotiations that the MPU will continue&#13;
in its present form for the life of the project.&#13;
2.15   The MPU consists of a central 'head office' and a regional/ provincial network. Overall&#13;
administrative responsibilities for the MPU are shared betwveen a coordinator for the Social&#13;
Recovery Programme and a coordinator for theEUfunded component. In addition to the&#13;
coordinators, the MiPU has an accountant, head of technical services, head of field training and&#13;
research coordinator. All posts are filled by local consultants on twc year contracts. Job&#13;
descriptions, performnance criteria and reporting mechanisms have been developed for each post.&#13;
Besides these local staff, the MPU has one intemational long-term consultant in an advisor&#13;
position. (Classification (c) of O.D. 8.40) Administrative procedures have been appraised and&#13;
found acceptable and cost effective (see Administrative Manual available in project files). The&#13;
Government has agreed to keep the MPU staffed at all times with staff whose qualifications and&#13;
terms of r.cference are acceptable to IDA.&#13;
2.16   The Head Office provides support to the regions, prepares technical plans and budgets for&#13;
each micr -project, deals with all the financial transactions of the micro-projects, assists with&#13;
procurement and plans, coordinates training and provides a secretariat for the SRP Steering&#13;
Committee. The MPU is represented in each Province bv a Regional Officer, usually located in the&#13;
Provincial Planning Unit (PPU) with which they have close links. The Regional Officer is the main&#13;
point of contact between communities and the MPU, providing advice to communities and NGOs&#13;
on MPU procedures; receiving completed application forms; coordinating micro-project desk&#13;
appraisal committees with district and PPU staff; coordinating and conducting microproject field&#13;
appraisals and launch workshops; monitoring microprojects with line Ministry district and&#13;
provincial staff; arranging for additional supervision and monitoring visits where required; and&#13;
issuing Completion Certificates to finished micro-projects. The Regional Officers report to and&#13;
seek advice from the MPU in Lusaka frequently, through an electronic mail and fax system linking&#13;
all provincial offices to the main data storage in the Lusaka Head Office. They report their&#13;
activities to Provincial Permanent Secretaries with whom they liaise regularly, and work very&#13;
closely with the Provincial Planning Unit staff. They part:cipate in Provincial Development&#13;
Committee and Provincial Task Force Meetings and represent the MPU in dealings with provincial&#13;
and district GRZ staff, with district councils and with NGOs.&#13;
2.17   The Steering Committee of the MPU approves or rejects micro-projects, ensures&#13;
coordination between donors, and compliance with GRZ policy. In addition it functions as a&#13;
pipeline for the findings of the LCMU and PAG in identifying specific poor and vulnerable target&#13;
communities. The MPU Steering Committee reports to the Social Recovery Project Policy&#13;
Coordinating Committee on a six monthly basis. The Project Policy Coordinating Committee&#13;
advises of any policv changes which could effect the criteria for project approval.&#13;
Micro-project Cycle&#13;
2.18   The Project will follow the procedures and implementation plan developed for SRP1&#13;
Evolutionary changes initiated within the micro-project cycle as a result of the various evaluations&#13;
and mid-term review will be consolidated in SRP2 (page 14). Further developments to the micro-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
project cycle will include district workshops and community based participatory planning&#13;
initiatives.(see para 2.29, Institutional Capacity Building).&#13;
2.19      Project capacity.    The capacity of the Provinces for on-going micro-projects will remain&#13;
at sixty per Province but because of increased involvement of district offices and refinement of the&#13;
appraisal and administrative procedures, the turnover is likely to increase to about four new&#13;
micro-projects per quarter per province. The average MPU contribution per micro-project is&#13;
around US$75,000.&#13;

2.20      Identification. This step in thc microproject cycle is demand driven. Micro-projects are&#13;
identified through a process of examination of needs by the communities themselves (pre-&#13;
identification assistance may be forthcoming from  the PAG  or other NGO  where the community&#13;
has been identified as amongst the extremely poor Sec para 2.31). A local group or community-&#13;
based organization elects a project committee and completes an application form. The micro-&#13;
project proposal should present a solution to an identified priority problem, and show how it will&#13;
benefit the poor and vulnerable. Applications to the MPU can only be made for micro-projects&#13;
which have widespread support within the community. The proposal must show a local community&#13;
contribution of about 25 percent of the total micro-project costs (in cash or kind and ascertained by&#13;
the field appraisal team): demonstrite that the micro-project can be successfullv completed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
normally within one year; and be simple enough to be implemented without significant technical&#13;
assistance from outside the community.&#13;
2.21   Micro-project Appraisal andApproval. The desk appraisal process (screening of&#13;
applications) is done by a district based Desk Appraisal Committee, whose members are the MPU&#13;
Regional Officer, Provincial Planning Officer (PPU), district officers of the relevant line ministries&#13;
and a member of the District Council. This process allows for coordination between donors and&#13;
sectors and encourages those who will be ultimately responsible for the micro-project to have an&#13;
input at the start of a micro-project's life. The MPU has developed scoring criteria with which to&#13;
desk-appraise proposals so that the task is performed in a consistent manner (criteria are found in&#13;
the Regional Officer's Manual, see project files). It is at this stage that the majority of micro-&#13;
project proposals not meeting Project criteria are screened out. The establishment of the District&#13;
Development Coordinating Committees (DDCC) and the recruitment of District Planners in each&#13;
District Council as part of Government's continuing policy of decentralisation will greatly assist&#13;
this process and it is anticipated these institutions will eventually take over the function of the Desk&#13;
Appraisal Committees.&#13;
2.22   Micro-projects approved at desk appraisal are then subjected to a field appraisal visit&#13;
made by the MPU Regional Officer accompanied by a member of the PPU and District staff. Field&#13;
appraisal forms have been developed for every sector, and include guidelines for both technical&#13;
appraisal of ihe proposed microproject and appraisal of community commitment to the micro-&#13;
project. The targets and community contribution are discussed in detail and agreed with the&#13;
community. The appraisal team assesses the size of the micro-project relative to the contribution&#13;
the community can make. Micro-projects which do not meet the requirement of a significant&#13;
community contribution are either rejected at this stage, or referred back to the community for an&#13;
increased contribution. The material component of the community contribution should be already&#13;
collected and in evidence at field appraisal before a micro-project is recommended for funding.&#13;
Where the community is obviously very poor and are willing but unable to meet the full community&#13;
contribution, the appraisal team may recommend a lesser contribution on a case by case basis.&#13;
2.23   Field appraisal reports are submitted to MPU Head Office where recommendations by the&#13;
appraisal team are checked by a committee of senior MPU staff. The Technical Section prepares&#13;
the budgets, based on field appraisal reports for the materials, labor, transport, fumiture and&#13;
equipment required to undertake the micro-project. The micro-project is then costed and presented&#13;
to the Steering Committee for approval. The Steering Committee, which meets every three months,&#13;
consists of representatives from GRZ line Ministries, members of the donor and NGO community&#13;
and other specialized agencies. Newv micro-project proposals are presented at each meeting and are&#13;
approved subject to GRZ priorities. On average, the approval process takes about six months from&#13;
first application.&#13;
2.24   Implementation. Following the forrnal approval of a micro-project proposal, a Financing&#13;
Agreement is prepared which includes detailed budgets and an outline of the responsibilities of the&#13;
various parties involved in implementing the micro-project. The Financing Agreement is the legal&#13;
agreement between the community and MPU and describes the conditions of financing. A Project&#13;
Launch Workshop (PLW) is held for every micro-project before any money is released. (Format&#13;
for PLW is in the Regional Officer's Manual available from Project Files). The workshop is&#13;
intended to avoid problems of misunderstanding about communities' responsibilities during micro-&#13;
project implementation. The Project Committee, formed by consensus in the community during the&#13;
initial stage of project identification, opens a bank account solely for the micro-project's use and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
the disbursement of funds starts. The funds are disbursed in four allocations. The first allocation is&#13;
36 percent of the total MPU contribution. The second and third allocations are each 24 percent of&#13;
the total approved budget and are disbursed only after 75 percent of the previous allocations are&#13;
justified with receipts. The fourth and last allocation is disbursed after an estimate has been made&#13;
of remaining works.&#13;
2.25   Monitoring. Monitoring is critical to successful microproject implementation. MPU&#13;
strives to keep a high standard of transparency and accountability by applying strict criteria for&#13;
micro-project appraisal and monitoring. Physical progress and financial reports are submitted by&#13;
microproject committees with every justification. These are complemented by quarterly monitoring&#13;
visits conducted by the MPU Regional Officer, Provincial Planning Unit and interested district&#13;
agencies. Resources are also provided to the district and provincial administrations for extra&#13;
monitoring. The distinction is made between technical monitoring and technical supervision.&#13;
Technical monitoring xvill be done by the Government Public Works Departments, Buildings&#13;
Officers (Education and Health), District Council Works Departments and other technically&#13;
qualified personnel wvho will visit the micro-project when it reaches key stages (e.g. foundation,&#13;
wall plate). Technical supervision will be budgeted for as part of each microproject and each&#13;
implementation committee will be expected to hire a technically qualified supervisor, on site daily,&#13;
and responsible for the quality of the work as well as the use of materials and labor.&#13;
2.26   The MPU is developing a networked database information system to monitor the physical&#13;
and financial progress of the micro-projects as well as all administrative transactions of the MPU.&#13;
All head office staff and Regional Officers wvill be connected to this data base allowing immediate&#13;
access to up-to-date and relevant information. The system wvill reduce administrative bottlenecks&#13;
and have the capacity to monitor benchmarks such) as number of microprojects in progress/&#13;
disbursements per province, number of microprojects per province at critical points in the project&#13;
cycle etc. These simple performance indicators will be used to assess the efficacy of changes&#13;
introduced in MPU procedures and in the microproject cycle by comparison with the parameters&#13;
used in the Project design profile (para 2.1 8). (see also annex 9).&#13;
2.27   Completion. A Completion Certificate is issued when the Regional Officer, community&#13;
and relevant GRZ line ministry officer have all signed to confirm that the micro-project is 100&#13;
percent physically complete, and the Justification Officer has signed to certify that it has justified&#13;
100 percent of the allocations made for its implementation. Micro-projects are closed if there has&#13;
been misuse of funds or no community commitment or contribution. Should a problem develop in&#13;
the financing of a microproject, communities are given every chance to pay back misspent funds&#13;
and/or to reduce targets so that the community benefits from at least part of the micro-project.&#13;
2.28   Maintenance and Sustainability. The MPU will coordinate its activities in the education&#13;
sector with the Preventive Maintenance System, (PMS) in the Ministry of Education, both at&#13;
national and provincial level. Schools wvhich apply for MPU funding must have an existing and&#13;
active Preventative Maintenance Committee in placc. For water and sanitation micro-projects,&#13;
MPU asks that members of the community are trained in the appropriate maintenance and there is&#13;
some cost sharing system in place for subsequent maintenance, before the micro-project is&#13;
approved. The application form asks that the community consider the issue before applying.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
Institutional Capacity Strengthening&#13;
2.29   The overall strategy in the Project is to encourage a gradual shift of responsibility for all&#13;
aspects of microproject implementation to the appropriate district agencies of the line ministries.&#13;
SRPI made a major input to the improvement of the capacity of communities, district officials,&#13;
provincial officials, and its own MPU staff, to plan, appraise, implement, monitor and maintain&#13;
capital projects. Regional Officers receive quarterly training. Provincial seminars, District&#13;
workshops and Project Launch workshops were developed in response to recommendations from&#13;
several evaluations. The Project will continue these activities, and add a component of community&#13;
capacity building which will complement and further develop these activities.&#13;
Community Capacity Building&#13;
2.30   Beneficiary Assessments identified a need to pay more attention to pre microproject&#13;
identification processes and community planning. The Technical Evaluation identified a need to&#13;
focus more on building community capacity to implement their microprojects in a technically sound&#13;
manner.&#13;
2.31  AMicroproject Identification Process. The Project will play an increased role in assisting&#13;
targeted very poor and vulnerable communities in problem identification and prioritization. The&#13;
Project may finance facilitators such as the Participatory Assessment Group (PAG), NGOs and&#13;
other agencies to work with targeted very poor and vulnerable communities in participatory&#13;
community based planning. This will be an informal gathering of the entire community during&#13;
which participatory techniques will be utilised to sharpen the community focus on its needs and&#13;
priorities and establish the steps to be taken in identifying a possible microproject. communities.&#13;
These facilitators will also be instrumental in enhancing the capacity of the beneficiary community&#13;
to undertake and sustain its owvn development.&#13;
2.32   Diversifying the Microproject Portfolio. Education accounted for 70 percent of MPU&#13;
microprojects in SRP I, and although education is a high priority, the Project would hope to&#13;
diversify its portfolio bv encouraging communities to identify other microprojects which are also&#13;
recognised as having a high priority. The Project will make every effort to maintain the 'demand-&#13;
led' principle in pursuing this goal. Participatory techniques will be introduced into the training&#13;
for Regional Officers and District officials and utilised as described in para 2.30.&#13;
2 33   Project Implementation Manual. The manual (available from project files) was&#13;
developed during SRPI, and aims to assist communities to implement their microproject. The&#13;
Manual deals with community organization and development as well as technical issues. The&#13;
Manual will be available to every new microproject approved as well as to district staff. It is&#13;
expected that this Manual will have a positive impact on community capacity to plan and&#13;
implement their owvn development.&#13;
2.34    Project Launch Workshops. Field appraisals and monitoring will become more&#13;
community-focused. Regional Officers will be trained in basic facilitation techniques and more&#13;
time will be allowed for these activities. Plans and budgets will be presented in a simpler and more&#13;
appropriate way to facilitate understanding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
District and Provincial Capacity Building&#13;
2.35   District Workshops. Increased district staff involvement in microprojects has assisted&#13;
communities in completing micro-projects faster, and in a technically sound manner. It also&#13;
insures that microprojects are physically maintained and provide effective service delivery after&#13;
completion. The Projcct wvill therefore strengthen the capacity of districts to assist communities&#13;
with microproject identification, appraisal, implemcntation and monitoring, by holding workshops&#13;
in every district. This activity is considered critical to both the sustainability of the microprojects&#13;
and their eventual absorption into the work of the district offices. The activity also reinforces the&#13;
Government's moves towards decentralization and devolution to the district level. It is expected&#13;
that district and sub district GRZ and district council staff as well as representation from local&#13;
government (Council Chairpersons and Chairpersons of sub committees) and NGOs will attend the&#13;
workshops. The district workshops xvill involve on the job training, and will also identify any local&#13;
initiatives in community facilitation and participatory planning with a view to tapping into and&#13;
assisting them. It is expected that one district workshop per quarter per province will be held, and&#13;
national coverage will be achieved in two years.&#13;
2.36   Provincial seminars. Provincial Seminars will continue for Provincial based staff.&#13;
Where there are active Provincial Development Coordinating Committees, the MPU will use that&#13;
forum for dissemination of information to Provincial level GRZ staff. Where these are not active&#13;
the Regional Officer will organize an annual Provincial workshop to report the progress of the&#13;
microprojects as well as discuss district and provincial involvement in the microproject cycle and&#13;
problems encountered during microproject implementation.&#13;
MPU Capacity&#13;
2.37  No further expansion in the administrativc capacity of the SRPI is envisaged. Regional&#13;
Officer Training will take place on a quartcrly basis, will include in-the-field, on-the-job training in&#13;
community development, facilitation techniques, technical appraisal and monitoring at the&#13;
provincial and district levels.&#13;
2.38   In summary, the actions proposed in this projcct empower communities by strengthening&#13;
the capacity of established community bascd organizations and those formcd spontaneously, to&#13;
clearly identify needs and priorities of the community, plan its development, organize achievement&#13;
of the objectives, account for moncy, implemcnt projccts and maintain the infrastructure created.&#13;
District and Provincial agencies will be trained in the use of the procedures, systems and&#13;
developed criteria so that institutions w ill be strengthencd in their capacity to appraise, monitor,&#13;
report, and assist communities to complete projects. The Project will support the district focus and&#13;
coordinate with DDCCs, health and education boards. Sectoral linkages will be maintained at&#13;
district, Provincial and National levels through DDCCs, PDCCs and the MPU Steering&#13;
Committee.&#13;
Poverty Monitoring Component&#13;
Overview&#13;
2.39   The experience under SRP I and the findings of several recent reports, including the&#13;
Poverty Assessment confirm the need for a systematic, integrated system of welfare or poverty&#13;
monitoring for Zambia. This component wvill support the establishment of such a capacity by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
building on (i) the work carried out on with BAs and participatory poverty assessment; and (ii) the&#13;
support given to the CSO for the Priority Surveys.&#13;
2.40   The Project will support a Participatory poverty assessment sub-component through the&#13;
Participatory Assessment Group (PAG) which will have responsibility for firstly capturing and&#13;
collating the analysis which different social groups among the poor make of their own situation,&#13;
and secondly, assisting the empowerment of chronically poor communities to utilise micro-project&#13;
resources.&#13;
2.41   In close coordination with the above, the Project will also support the creation of a Living&#13;
Conditions Monitoring Unit (LCMU) in the CSO as a sub-component which will collect and&#13;
disseminate data on individuals, households, and communities. To ensure the essential close&#13;
collaboration and reinforcement of linkages between the two sub-components, all the poverty&#13;
monitoring activities will be under the same cross-sectoral Poverty Monitoring Steering Committee.&#13;
Participatory poverty analysis sub-component&#13;
2.42   The experience of the Zambia Poverty Assessment has shown that the use of participatory&#13;
research methods provides a highly valuable complement to more conventional forms of poverty&#13;
analysis. The value of these approaches in the preparation of Poverty Assessments has become&#13;
widely recognised within the World Bank. The participatory content of these approaches derives&#13;
from the extent to which they can represent in a process of poverty analysis the needs, priorities,&#13;
perceptions and lived experience of the poor. The experience of the Poverty Assessment in Zambia&#13;
has showvn that such exercises are greatly enriched by including within them the analysis that&#13;
different social groups among the poor make of their own situation - its causes, as well as the key&#13;
constraints and opportunities that they face. The qualitative characteristic of the approach derives&#13;
from a stress on examining those aspects of poverty - and the processes that create and perpetuate&#13;
it - that are not easily subject to investigation through large-scale questionnaire survey approaches,&#13;
either because they are too complex, too locally specific, operate at levels which are not captured&#13;
by the unit of analysis used in a questionnaire (generally the household) or are simply not easily&#13;
subject to quantitative measurement. These include such critical dimensions as the social&#13;
characteristics of the poor; their vulnerability to dynamic processes of change (seasonal stress;&#13;
economic, environmental or political 'shocks'; long-term trends such as declining soil fertility) and;&#13;
the coping strategies that the poor use to deal with the negative effects of change.&#13;
2.43   The team of researchers who have successfully carried out three Beneficiary Assessments,&#13;
a Participatory Poverty Assessment and several ad hoc studies over the last years have constituted&#13;
a small non-governmental organization, the Participatory Assessment Group. The PAG will carry&#13;
out the participatory monitoring and empowerment sub-component in close consultation with users&#13;
groups and with the LCMU in CSO.&#13;
2.44   Broad objectives of the Poverty Assessment Group are to improve the poverty reduction&#13;
content of policies at the macro economic and sectoral levels; to improve the efficacy of safety net&#13;
activities; and to assist in the process of empowerment for poor communities to undertake their&#13;
own development. These objectives will be realised through the activities described in paragraphs&#13;
2.44 and 2.45&#13;
2.45   Participatory Poverty Monitoring Exercises. These are field based surveys using&#13;
Participatory Rapid Appraisal research techniques. The 1993 Poverty Assessment for Zambia will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
be used as a model and it is anticipated that the same ten study sites will be used in order to&#13;
facilitate the monitoring objective. The participatory monitoring component will examine:&#13;
(a) Vulnerability. Taking into account the dynamic processes which threaten the&#13;
livelihoods of poor households and communities, whether through the negative effects&#13;
of long-term trends, inter-annual variation (e.g. drought), seasonal stress, or the impact&#13;
of various kinds of shocks'.&#13;
(b) Diversity. The experience of poverty, and the key constraints which people face vary&#13;
according to locality and according to the social status and position within the&#13;
household or community which an individual holds; and&#13;
(c) Institutional issues including the capacity to mobilise organisational and&#13;
institutional resources and the dxnamics of social organisation.&#13;
2.46   The poverty monitorirng component will coordinate with the LCMS in the design of survey&#13;
modules; report on living conditions and livelihoods of the rural and urban poor of Zambia; give&#13;
regular feedback from these communities on their perceptions of the impact of policy change and&#13;
their needs and priorities; and make policv recommcndations. As part of its work program the&#13;
PAG will undertake:&#13;
(a)  Beneficiary Assessments, regular qualitative and participatory monitoring and&#13;
evaluation for the MPU microprojects;&#13;
(b)  District Level Training and Community Participatory Planning, assisting the MPU&#13;
to improve its targeting to poor and vulnerable groups, including women and those&#13;
communities living in remote and inaccessible areas. The wvork will involve training&#13;
of district staff, identification of vulncrable communities and participatory planning&#13;
with those communities. The outcome of these activities will be to empower&#13;
communities to initiate their own development, including the identification, planning&#13;
and implementation of possible microprojects;&#13;
(c)  Thematic Studies, the demand for the skills offered by the PAG is high, and it is&#13;
intended that the PAG will also undertake studies identified by policy makers and&#13;
implementors, through the Study Fund. These studies will document the perceived&#13;
impact of policy changes on the lives of the rural and urban poor, and thus provide&#13;
policy indicators for macro and sectoral policy makers.&#13;
Living Conditions Monitoring Survey Sub-component&#13;
2.47   As discussed under 'lessons learned' in Chapter 1, there have been some significant&#13;
problems with the surveys sub-component of SRP I. At the CSO, in addition to the priority&#13;
surveys, a number of household surveys covering social issues have been carried out or are in the&#13;
planning stage. These surveys have often been launched on an ad-hoe basis, intended to give some&#13;
answers to urgent information needs, with not much emphasis given to coordination and&#13;
standardisation. For the statistical sub-component of this Project a new approach is proposed.&#13;
The CSO has agreed to establish the Living Conditions Monitoring Unit (LCMU) as a sustainable&#13;
and integral part of its monitoring activities. The Project wvill finance the first four rounds of the&#13;
LCMS on a sliding scale wvhich ends after the four years w'ith 100 percent GRZ support. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
LCMS will contain an annual modular survey as the core element, with additional ad-hoc modules&#13;
which will support areas of specific interest. The Norwvegian Government has indicated its interest&#13;
.n providing a grant administered by IDA to support this component (the Norwegian Grant). As a&#13;
condition of effectiveness for this grant, the Government through the CSO will present a workplan&#13;
and staff allocation plan for the LCMU in a form acceptable to IDA.&#13;
2.48   The LCMU wvill design an annual survey program (the LCMS), whose execution and&#13;
management is within the capacity of the CSO. The monitoring program will be designed on a&#13;
modular platformn. A core module, repeated annually, will include a set of priority indicators. As&#13;
need arises modules covering additional dimensions, or expanding on those already in the core&#13;
module, could be added, at the request of a Ministry responsible for a particular aspect of social&#13;
sector development, or other involved agency, either on an ad hoc basis, or at regular intervals. In&#13;
addition, specified target groups can be given special attention, both by extending the sample and&#13;
by giving them an extended questionnaire, specifically designed to describe their situation. In this&#13;
xxa\ the LCMS wvill provide informnation that monitors changes on an annual basis, as well as&#13;
having the flexibility to respond to urgent issues raised by users and other parties.&#13;
2.49   Other ongoing and planned survey activities will be coordinated with the proposed LCMS&#13;
in order to create a humanized, standardized and cost-effective way of producing social statistics.&#13;
A coordinated data base with information from  several surveys will provide the Zambian&#13;
Government, donor agencies, the research community, and the CSO itself with new insights for&#13;
improved policy decisions and targeted interventions to alleviate poverty. The annually monitoring&#13;
concept ensures that trend analyses, giving information on the effects of policy decisions and&#13;
external factors (drought etc.) on the welfare of households, will be possible.&#13;
2.50   To improve the survey quality, workshops on technical issues such as; questionnaire&#13;
design, measurement issues, data quality aspects, training of field staff will be an important part of&#13;
the preparatory work. A long term consultant *vith extensive experience in household survey&#13;
management will be assisting the CSO by wvorking Avith a counterpart for the first twvo years.&#13;
2.51   This system will give rapid, reliable information on key indicators, but will not necessarily&#13;
produce datasets for in-depth analysis on all components. The system will also serve as a national&#13;
baseline to which surveys covering e.g. vulnerable groups, special items or geographical areas&#13;
could be compared. The svstenm would give the different users a system of social indicators against&#13;
which to monitor development.&#13;
2.52   The conceptual framcework, managenment structure and more detailed description of the&#13;
methodologies to be employed in the two complementary components of the Poverty Monitoring&#13;
Component can be found in annexes 2 and 3.&#13;
2.53   The institutional framework and management structure of the LCMU and PAG is&#13;
designed to secure exchange and cooperation betwveen the different methodologies employed.&#13;
Mutual representation in the technical committees of the two units will secure exchange of&#13;
information on activities, plans, findings and research questions. The LCMS program needs input&#13;
from the PAG particularly in the planning stage of a survey. The Participatory Assessment of 1993&#13;
did follow-up studies and provided in-depth explanations to several questions that was raised&#13;
during the analysis of the PS 1. Through this experience a good relationship and a cooperative&#13;
tradition is already established between the participatory and the quantitative monitoring&#13;
communities. The proposed institutional framework further encourages this through formal links,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
but the informal exchange and mutual cooperation is just as important and will hopefully evolve&#13;
over time.&#13;
Poverty Analysis&#13;
2.54   There is a wealth of data in Zambia which are not analyzed and made available to potential&#13;
users. The public institutions, ministries and policy makers need to be further involved in the&#13;
identification of research areas, the commissioning of studies and involved in the study cycle to&#13;
improve their ownership of the studies and their results. Research teams need more guidance in&#13;
research methodologies, research topics, analytical skills and presentation of study findings. To&#13;
assist in such capacity building the Slitdy Fiuncd, initiated in SRP 1, will continue to be supported by&#13;
the Project.&#13;
The Study Fund&#13;
2.55   The main concern will be to support research and studies which focus on policy related&#13;
poverty issues. The Study Fund will aim to improve communication between the research&#13;
community and the policy makers and implementors. It will encourage the analysis of existing data&#13;
so that it is presented in a usable form to the policy makers and program implementors, thereby&#13;
assisting in the formulation of policies and implementation of programs.&#13;
2.56   Studies considered by the Study Fund will be concerned with:&#13;
(a) analysis of current policy, mainly in the social sectors; and&#13;
(b) analysis of the impact of the structural adjustment program on vulnerable groups;&#13;
(c) analysis of poverty issues.&#13;
2.57   The Studv Fund will bc administered by a Research Advisor, supported by a secretary.&#13;
The functions of the Research Advisor wvill be to involve the policy makers to a greater extent in&#13;
research identification and implementation so that studies of contemporary issues are&#13;
commissioned; identify' up to date data sources and availability for analysis; advise researchers&#13;
and reviewers on methodological and analytical issues; organise and coordinate research&#13;
workshops and seminars for on-going studies; and facilitate dissemination of study results.&#13;
Research methodology workshops may be held as well as training in data analysis and&#13;
presentation. The Study Fund publications - the Guidelines and Research Manual - will assist&#13;
researchers to undertake better focused orientated research (available from project files).&#13;
2.58   The Study Fund will administer the finance of the studies, provide advice and some&#13;
logistical support. The Study Fund Steering Committee will approve or reject studies, determine&#13;
priority research areas, identify data sources and assist with the dissemination of the research&#13;
results. The donor, non governmental and research communities and Governnent of Republic of&#13;
Zambia line ministries will be represented on the Study Fund Steering Committee. The Study Fund&#13;
Committee will report the results of studies, ongoing studies and study proposals to the SRP&#13;
Coordinating conmmittee on a six monthly basis. Members of the Steering Committee will indicate&#13;
areas of particular concern to policy at the same time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
2.59   The Study Fund will finance government agencies, non-governmental organizations,&#13;
research institutions, private constancy groups and individuals to undertake relevant studies and&#13;
will make available the resources so that the capacity of institutions to perform analysis is&#13;
strengthened. The Study Fund through the Research Advisor, will provide researchers with advice&#13;
on research methods; sampling techniques; analysis; report writing and dissemination.&#13;
2.60   Small Studies. The Study Fund will continue to fund small studies on a demand led basis.&#13;
Studies proposed by local researchers which analyze existing data may be considered up to an&#13;
amount of US$15,000. Analysis of existing data will be encouraged, especially that of data&#13;
produced under the survey sub-component of SRP I and the poverty monitoring component of this&#13;
Project. The main social sector ministries, health, education and community development may use&#13;
the facilities of the Study Fund to analyze existing data in order to enable them to target their&#13;
programs more effectively toward the poor and vulnerable. For example, the Study Fund has&#13;
recently approved a study proposed by the Ministry of Health on the effects of the user fees on the&#13;
accessibility of health services.&#13;
2.61   Priority.Studies. These may involve amounts above the ceiling of the small studies and&#13;
the engagement of international consultants. Priority Studies will be identified and proposed by the&#13;
relevant Ministry and approved by the Study Fund Committee. Currently the following have been&#13;
identified: Beneficiary Assessments of social safety net activities; a study of changes in living&#13;
conditions using Priority Surveys I and 2 data; and a study on nutrition and household food&#13;
security.&#13;
2.62   Study Cycle. Study proposals are made by government institutions, University, local&#13;
consultancies, NGOs and private individuals. The proposal must include an abstract and describes&#13;
in detail the study objectives, hypothesis, methods to be used, secondary data sources, primnary data&#13;
collection sampling methods (if any), models of analysis, study activities, the capability of the&#13;
intended research team and a budget. A detailed literature review must be included so that the gaps&#13;
in existing research or literature are identified. The Study Fund secretariat screens the proposal to&#13;
ensure that the proposal complies with Study Fund criteria and that the methods to be used and the&#13;
budget proposed are realistic before presenting to the Study Fund Committee. The committee&#13;
determines if the proposal complies with Study Fund criteria, and the relevant Ministry is invited to&#13;
comment on the relevance of the proposed study to contemporary policy issues. If the outcome of&#13;
these initial assessments is positive, the Committee assigns expert reviewers, one from the policy&#13;
making Ministry and one to review the methodological aspects of the Study. Through this process&#13;
of review and the guidance provided by these identified experts, the proposal is developed before&#13;
being finally approved by the Study Fund Committee. The first allocation of funds represents one&#13;
third of the research fees as well as one third of the reimbursable costs. The remaining research&#13;
fees are paid when final rcport is accepted and further allocations of reimbursable costs when&#13;
advances are accounted for. The reviewers assigned to the study are expected to hold study&#13;
seminars and assist the researchers w'ith analysis and methodological issues. The reviewers also&#13;
review the draft and approve the final report before it is submitted to the Study Committee. Upon&#13;
completion of a study, the researches are expected to organize a dissemination workshop, funded&#13;
by the Study Fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
C. Project Coordination and Management&#13;
2.63   The three components of the Social Recovery Project II will be coordinated by a Project&#13;
Coordination Committee chaired by the Pcrmancnt Secretary for Planning in the Office of the&#13;
President and consisting of high level policy makers from sector ministries plus representatives&#13;
from the individual component steering committees. The Project Coordinator in the MPU will be&#13;
the secretary of the Coordination Committee. The Committee would meet infrequently, probably&#13;
twice a year. Each component will be led by a Steering Committee. For the community initiatives&#13;
component, this wvill be the existing MPU Steering Committee, for the analysis component this will&#13;
be the existing Study Fund committee, and for the monitoring component it will be a newly created&#13;
committee with cross-sectoral representation from data users and producers. The overall&#13;
responsibility for management of the Project is vested in the Project Coordinator assisted by the&#13;
Financial Controller for financial matters. An accountant will be financed for the CSO for&#13;
administration of the Nonvegian Grant for this sub-component.&#13;
D. Sustainability&#13;
2.64   The Micro-Projects Unit. The MPU. as supported by IDA, will not be sustained beyond&#13;
the life of the Project, but the philosophy of self-help and the procedures and criteria developed in&#13;
order to implement and support community initiatives will be. The skills learnt by communities&#13;
during the project to use and account for funds, build, rehabilitate and maintain infrastructure will&#13;
be sustained by the communities themselves. The transfer of skills to district staff, especially in the&#13;
appraisal and monitoring of projects wvill ensure that both the approach and process of the MPU&#13;
are sustained. The MPU will assist other agencies in the development of criteria and&#13;
implementation processes. It is likely that at the mid-term review of this project, the capacity of&#13;
district agencies will have been sufficiently strengthened to allow the DDCC, with funds from the&#13;
proposed District Development Fund, to gradually assume the functions of the MPU using its&#13;
approach and processes. The decision to take this step, and planning the transition, will be&#13;
important components of the mid-term review.&#13;
2.65   Completed Micro-Projects. Sustainabilitv of the micro-projects is assured by the fact that&#13;
the community implementing the project has contributed substantially to it and has an increased&#13;
sense of ownership. Every micro-project w ill have an established and functioning maintenance&#13;
committee. Since the government agencies have also been involved with the development and the&#13;
implementation of each micro-project from the beginning, the maintenance of the service delivery is&#13;
assured (see also para 2.28).&#13;
2.66   Participatory Poverty Assessment Group. The PAG will be sustained through the&#13;
institutional strengthening. By the end of the Project the PAG would have proven itself as a capable&#13;
institution producing policy relevant output. If this is not the case, there is no point in trying to&#13;
sustain the institution. Gradually, the PAG wvill bccome independent of project subsidization as&#13;
other institutions in and outside Government fund specific modules or data collection exercises. It&#13;
is expected that this will be achieved through a support programme which will gradually diminish&#13;
over the life of the project. Before the mid-term review of the Project, the PAG will prepare a&#13;
business plan for making the unit sustainable without further subsidy from this Project after the&#13;
fourth year. As the PAG evolves to'ards sustainability the Project may buy its services to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
continue the work required for SRP monitoring and implementation. A reasonable time will be&#13;
required to allow the PAG to develop a track record in participatory monitoring as there is still&#13;
limited knowledge of these methodologies and their relevance in Zambia.&#13;
2.67   Living Costs Monitoring Unit. The LCMS will be sustained by increasing the share of&#13;
government funding of the LCMU's activities over the life of the project. The Project will finance&#13;
the first two years of collection of the core module information, by which time the Government is&#13;
expected to take over financing. The Government is projected to take over the full costs of the&#13;
LCMU' activities by the end of the fourth round of data collection. By this time the capacity of the&#13;
LCMU will have been built and the monitoring program should be able to sustain itself.&#13;
2.68   Study Fund. As a unit within NCDP, the Study Fund will not be sustained. The capacity&#13;
of the researchers, the reviewers, the policy makers and the implementors to identify critical&#13;
research areas, implement a research project. analyze data in a logical and focused manner and act&#13;
on the findings wvill be sustained. An institution which may absorb the ideas and approach to the&#13;
process of research developed by the Study Fund will be identified before the mid-tern review. One&#13;
possibility is to transfer the functions of the Study Fund to the Social Policy Research Institute,&#13;
recently established in the Universitv of Zambia or similar institution.&#13;
E. Special Project Issues&#13;
2.69   Environmental Issues. As The Project has been rated C, no environmental assessment is&#13;
necessary. Environmental concerns, based on the National Environmental Action Plan will be built&#13;
into micro-project appraisal and monitoring criteria as spelt out in the Regional Officers Manual&#13;
available from project files. Overall it is expected that the project will have a positive effect on the&#13;
environment due to the eligibility of environmental micro-projects, and the focus on water and&#13;
sanitation in the infrastructure rehabilitation micro-projects. There will be no significant negative&#13;
impact from the infrastructure micro-projects as they are concerned with rehabilitation not new&#13;
construction.&#13;
2.70   Gender issues. All components of the project incorporate gender concerns. During&#13;
identification of micro-projects, appraisal criteria include a review of the involvement of women&#13;
and other marginalized groups in the identification, implementation and maintenance of the project.&#13;
Microprojects benefiting poor women will receive higher priority. The microproject database will&#13;
maintain gender-disagregated data allowing gender-specific monitoring of the impact of the&#13;
community initiatives component. The collection of survey and participatory data will also be&#13;
gender-desegregated. The combination of household survey and more participatory data collection&#13;
will allow a better understanding of inter- and intra-household dynamics. Finally studies for&#13;
consideration by the Poverty Analysis component will receive higher priority if they include gender&#13;
aspects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
F. Reporting and Reviews&#13;
2.71   The MPU will coordinate the production of an annual report on project implementation no&#13;
later than June I of the followving year. Contributions will be made from the CSO, PAG and the&#13;
Study Fund. The outline of the report is prcscntcd in Annex 6. Based on this review the MPU will&#13;
invite IDA, other interested donors, NGOs and Government agencies to an annual review workshop&#13;
to be held no later than July I of every year (beginning in 1996 for the year 1995).&#13;
2.72   A mid-term review will be held not less than 30 months and not more than 36 months after&#13;
The Project becomes effective, or when 50 percent of funds have been committed, whichever comes&#13;
first. For the mid-term review the Government has agreed to commission independent reviews of&#13;
each component and will summarize the findings and recommendation in a report submitted by the&#13;
Project Coordination Committee to the donors and IDA. In preparing these reviews, consultations&#13;
will be held with all relevant line Ministries and other agencies involved in the social sectors. Based&#13;
on these recommendations, Government will prepare an action plan for discussion and adoption at&#13;
the mid-term review which will enable the MPU to be phased out as a separate entity on&#13;
completion of the Project, and the transfer of its functions, skills and procedures to other agencies.&#13;
2.73   Each component implementing agency will submit a report to the Project Policy&#13;
Coordination committee everv six months, describing project progress and highlighting specific&#13;
issues that have arisen in implementation for which policy guidance is required (See Annex 6 for&#13;
outline). These reports will be summarized by the Project Coordinator, as secretary to the Policy&#13;
Coordinating Committee. The steering committees for the components will meet every quarter to&#13;
review progress based on reports from the implementing agencies.&#13;

Chapter 3: PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND&#13;
DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
A. Costs&#13;
3.1    The total cost of the Project is US$47.7 million, of which IDA will finance US$30 million&#13;
equivalent. The size of the community initiatives component of the project is estimated by&#13;
appraising the capacity of communities and the MPU to complete ongoing microprojects and&#13;
process new applications respectively. Based on the experience of first program, an input of 4 new&#13;
microprojects per quarter per province is estimated to be possible. Assuming the mean value of&#13;
microprojects as US$75,000, (based on the first project), investment would be US$54 million&#13;
over 5 years for the total of 9 provinces. SRP2 will take up approximately two thirds of this&#13;
capacity with a community initiatives component of US$35.8 million equivalent, and Government&#13;
is negotiating wvith the EU to cover the remainder under a separate intervention. No allowance is&#13;
made for contingencies as the number and size of activities funded would be revised to fit within&#13;
the existing financing framework. The nominal exchange rate is assumed to adjust during the life of&#13;
the Project so as to maintain a constant real exchange rate.&#13;

3.2   The total costs for SRP2 will be financed as follows: IDA will fund 63 percent of total,&#13;
Government 8 percent, beneficiaries 23 percent (25 percent of the costs of the micro-projects) and&#13;
donors the remainder (see Table 3.1). Nonvay will be funding the LCMS component of the Poverty&#13;
Monitoring component as a follow-up to their funding of the surveys under SRP 1. SIDA has&#13;
agreed to fund the PAG component of the Poverty Monitoring, and these two donors will also be&#13;
jointly funding the Poverty Analysis component (Study Fund) with IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
3.3    The Project will finance two long term external consultants: (i) an extension of contract&#13;
for the current advisor to the MPU for another twvo years, based upon the positive experience of&#13;
SRP 1. In this project, the consultant will assist in completing the restructuring of MPU&#13;
procedures, and in moving management of the community initiatives component to District&#13;
Government; (ii) based on a recommendation stemming from the CSO component Evaluation&#13;
Report, and the negative experience with a number of short-term TA assignments for the CSO, a&#13;
long term advisor, w ith a two year term, wvill assist in setting up the new Poverty Monitoring&#13;
Component. Both contracts will contain provisions for the transfer of skills, and will have the&#13;
primary aim of building local capacity.&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
3.4    This Project is undetermined for procurement purposes; the exact mix of goods and&#13;
services to be financed by the Credit will depend on the results of demand-driven microproject&#13;
identification. Procurement will be carried out in accordance with the IDA guidelines, Procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits dated January 1995, in particular Section 3.15, Community&#13;
Participation in Procurement. Project Committees are responsible for procurement of goods,&#13;
services and civil works under the micro-projects with support from the MPU. This worked very&#13;
well under SR.P 1. Monitoring and audit procedures for procurement by microproject committees&#13;
will follow the guidelines established under SRP 1, and are detailed in the Regional Officer's&#13;
Implementation Manual. The MPU is responsible for procurement of goods and services for other&#13;
components. Implementation staff have been trained in IDA procurement procedures and will&#13;
receive ongoing support from the World Bank's Southern Africa Departmental Procurement Unit&#13;
throughout the life of The Project.&#13;
3.5    Assessment of Procurement under SRPI. IDA has appraised the MPU's capacity to&#13;
manage procurement and found it fully satisfactory. The auditors have found no irregularities in&#13;
procurement performance over the lifc of SRP I. Even so, the Government has proposed to assess&#13;
the efficiency of the procurement procedures followed. Should any changes in procurement&#13;
procedures be identified, these will be incorporated in The Project.&#13;
3.6    Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.2. International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB) will be carried out in accordance with IDA guidelines for contracts with a cost of&#13;
$500,000 or more for civil works and for contracts with an estimated cost of $ 100,000 or more for&#13;
goods. Domestic preference will be employed where applicable in these procurements as per IDA&#13;
guidelines. ICB is unlikely to be used for civil works as most of the civil works contracts are small&#13;
and scattered, however where desirable from an efficiency standpoint contracts would be combined&#13;
to allow ICB. ICB is likely to be used for bulk procurement for equipment for micro-projects as&#13;
well as for equipment and vehicles for the MPU and the CSO.&#13;
3.7    National Competitive Bidding (NCB), following procedures acceptable to IDA and using&#13;
standard documents approved under SRPI, will be carried out for contracts with a cost of less than&#13;
US$500,000 for civil works and less than US$ 100,000 for goods. This category is not expected to&#13;
exceed US$8.6 million total during the life of the project. The civil works to be carried out by this&#13;
process will be upgrading and major rehabilitation of mainly urban schools. They are not likely to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-&#13;
attract international interest, but if foreign firms wish to participate they should be allowed to do&#13;
so.&#13;

3.8     Prudent national shopping, obtaining at least three quotes from reliable suppliers may be&#13;
used for contracts wvith an estimated value of less than US$50,000 equivalent for goods upto an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$4.8 million. This procedure has already been used effectively by the&#13;
SRP I. Goods procured by Community Microproject Committees include classroom furniture,&#13;
blackboards, classroom supplies etc. As far as possible contracts for supplies and equipment will&#13;
be pooled and carried out by the MPU to ensure cost savings. This is indicated in Table 3.2 by the&#13;
microprojects procurement for goods being divided between 'community'and 'other'.&#13;
3.9     For the infrastructure (microprojects) sub-components, community contribution and&#13;
involvement will be encouraged. SRP I showed that greater community involvement better ensures&#13;
the sustainability of the microprojccts, facilitates the use of local expertise and materials, and&#13;
results in application of labour intensive technologies appropriate to the local conditions. To ensure&#13;
the continuation of this positive development, community microproject committees will manage&#13;
their own projects, hiring skilled artisans and purchasing materials using either local shopping or&#13;
direct contracting procedures, proven to be both efficient and expedient. Experience in Zambia has&#13;
shown that it is not cost-effective to do bulk procurement of building supplies and then distribute&#13;
these to sites. Where practical, i.e. where more than one local building contractor can be identified,&#13;
microproject committees will be required by the MPU acting through the Regional Officer, to&#13;
subject local building contracts to competitive procedures. These procurement processes may be&#13;
applied for contracts with an estimated value of less than US$50,000 equivalent, (upto an&#13;
aggregate value of no more than US$12.5 million). Works in this category shall be procured under&#13;
lumpsum, fixed price contracts.&#13;
3.10    Itcms not subjected to competitive bidding include per diem, fuel, and other administrative&#13;
expenses, not to exceed an aggregate of US$0.6 million equivalent. These will be procured using&#13;
local procedures acceptablc to IDA, and established during SRP I.&#13;

3.11    Consultant services, (including support of MPU implementation consultants described&#13;
under 'Incremental and recurring costs' in Tablcs 3.2 and 3.3), studies, and training will be&#13;
procured following IDA guidelines "Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency, August 1981". IDA will finance consultant services for a total&#13;
cost of US$2.1 million . IDA will finance technical skills training to meet community based needs&#13;
to an aggregate value of US$0.6 million equivalent. Such training course might include well-&#13;
digging, financial management, preventative maintenance workshops etc. In addition IDA will&#13;
finance capacity building to an aggregate of US$1. 1 million equivalent through quarterly training&#13;
of Regional Officers, Provincial and District seminars, microproject pre-identification and launch&#13;
workshops as recommended in various evaluations of SRPI.&#13;
3.12    Tender Documentation Format. IDA's standard bidding documents will be used for all&#13;
ICB financed by the credit. For NCB the Government prepared standard documentation approved&#13;
as acceptable to IDA during SRP I will be used.&#13;
3.13   Procurement Review Thresholds. During project supervision, bidding packages for IDA&#13;
financed contracts above thresholds of US$250,000 for Nvorks and US$ 100,000 for goods would&#13;
be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. The threshold for prior review of consultant services&#13;
would be US$100,000 for contracts with consulting firms, US$50,000 for contracts with&#13;
individuals and all sole source contracts and terms of reference regardless of contract value. All&#13;
other contracts will be subject to selective post review. The MPU will be required to maintain&#13;
proper records for easy review by IDA. It is expected that two thirds of NCB contracts for works&#13;
and one third of NCB contracts for goods will be subject to post award review.&#13;
D. Disbursements&#13;
Table 3.3: Disbursemcnt Schedule&#13;

(US$ m. equivalent)  financed&#13;
1. Comrmnunity Initiatives (microprojects)            19.7        90 percent of MPU expenditures&#13;
2. Training, workshops, consultant services, studics   4.8         100 percent&#13;
under the poverty analysis component participatory&#13;
poverty monitoring sub-componeint&#13;
3. Vehicles, equipment and civil works for the MPlU    1.4         100 percent of foreign&#13;
expenditures, 100 percent of local&#13;
ex-factory costs, and 80 percent of&#13;
other local expenditures&#13;
4. Incremental Recurrent Costs                         1.1         100 percent&#13;
5. Project Preparation Fund                            0.3&#13;
6. Unallocated                                         2.7&#13;
Total                     30.0&#13;
3.14   It is estimated that the IDA credit wvill be disbursed over a period of 5 years, from July&#13;
1995 through the June 2000, with procurement and disbursements completed by June 30, 2000&#13;
(completion date) and December 31, 2000 (closing date), respectively. The proposed allocation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
the credit is showvn in Table 3.3. Disbursement for microprojects will be made based on&#13;
disbursements from the MPU to Project Committees. To ensure that the IDA Credit will not&#13;
finance t;.xes, IDA wvill only disburse 90 percent of MPU expenditures. In addition to the MPU&#13;
expenditures on mWroprojects, the communitics thcmselves finance on average 25 percent of the&#13;
microproject estimated cost. Therefore, a total of 35 percent of a microproject's costs are not&#13;
financed by IDA. This difference more than adequately covers the proposed VAT of 20 percent on&#13;
goods. The total estimated contribution of Government is US$0.5 million equivalent per year over&#13;
the- life of the project. This will cover the 10 percent not financed by IDA. At negotiations,&#13;
assurances will be souight from Government that this obligation will be met annually. For 1995,&#13;
Government has ,.lready disbursed half of this amount to the MPU. Incremental recurrent costs&#13;
include the costs necessary for the operation of the MPU and the Study Fund, including, but not&#13;
limited to: salaries for non-professional staff, fees, per diems, travel costs, benefits (including&#13;
housing and medical), office supplies, fuel and maintenance of vehicles, maintenance of equipment,&#13;
telephc ne and other communication charges, and office rent. Other utilities will be paid by the&#13;
Government. Pavment of 100% of incremental costs is justified since this is a time limited&#13;
program, whose costs will disappear at completion.&#13;
3.15  In order to ensure that counterpart funding is available to pay local taxes, Government has&#13;
agreed to establish a Project Fund which will be maintained at a minimum of US $ 100,000&#13;
equivalen-, and will be replenished on a quarterly basis. It will be a responsibility of the Project&#13;
Coordinator to prepare estimates of annual project expenditures, and advise Government on the&#13;
amount to be included in the annual budget estimates. An account for this fund will be maintained&#13;
by the MPU as part of the project accounts.&#13;
3.16   All applications to withdraw proceeds from the credit will be fully documented, except for&#13;
expenditures for training, workshops, recurrent costs, and for contracts with a value of&#13;
US$ 100,000 or less for goods and services and a value of US$250,000 or less for civil works for&#13;
which reimbursement may be made against certified statements of expenditure (SOEs). Supporting&#13;
documentation will be retained by the MPU and will be available for review as requested by IDA&#13;
supervision missions and project auditors. Estimated disbursements by IDA fiscal year are shown&#13;
in Table 3.4.&#13;

3.17   A special account for US$3 million would be made available to the MPU for payments of&#13;
eligible expenditures. Requests for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted to&#13;
IDA every month under normal circumstances but no later than every three months. Withdrawal&#13;
applications for direct payment from the Credit Account may be submitted for expenditures above&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent.&#13;
3.18   The Norwcgian Government will make available a grant to finance the living conditions&#13;
monitoring component, and part of the Study Fund. The grant will be administered by IDA. A&#13;
special aCcoll.t x\ ill be established to be administered by the MPU.&#13;
3.19   The Swedish Govemment will make available a grant to finance the Participatory&#13;
Assessment Group and part of the Study Fund. The grant wvill be administered by IDA. A special&#13;
account will be established to be administered by the MPU.&#13;
E. Accounts and Audit&#13;
3.20   As soon as possible after the end of the Zambian financial year, but no later than six&#13;
months after its completion, the Government has confirmed that it will present audit reports of the&#13;
special account and the project accounts with a separate opinion on the use of the special account&#13;
and SOEs. The audits will be carried out by an independent auditing firm with qualifications and&#13;
under terms of reference acceptable to IDA. In auditing the project accounts, the auditors will pay&#13;
special attention to verifying the reliability of SOEs, and to the internal controls and procedures&#13;
involved in the preparation of SOEs. Project Committee's accounts will be included in the audit on&#13;
a random sample basis. The costs of the audits are eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the&#13;
credit. Audit reports should be produced for each component covering the use of SOEs,&#13;
management of the special account and other matters. The audit report for the community&#13;
initiatives component should include a review of microproject committee's performance on a&#13;
sample basis.&#13;
3.21   Project accounts vill be established and maintained by the MPU. A SpecialAccount will&#13;
be opened for this project and maintained with a commercial bank by the MPU. The maximum&#13;
balance in the Special Account will be US$3 million, which will cover about 3 months of&#13;
expenditures at full operation. The MPU has performed vcry well in managing several special&#13;
accounts under implementation of SRP I and other donor funded projects.&#13;
3.22   Audit. The Government's performance in auditing project accounts under projects in&#13;
Zambia has generally been acceptable and the Government is in full compliance on other social&#13;
sector projects. The quality of the audits has also been satisfactory. The audits under the SRP1&#13;
have generally been satisfactory and have been completed on time. An exception was an audit of&#13;
the CSO component of SRP 1, which criticized the CSO's financial management capacity. The&#13;
Government took immediate action and transferred the financial management to the MPU, and&#13;
since then the audit reports for the component have been satisfactory and unqualified.&#13;

Chapter 4: PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
4.1    Community Initiatives: The benefits of the community initiative component of the Social&#13;
Recovery Fund xwill be evident of many levels, including the following:&#13;
(a) improved infrastructures in health, education and econornic infrastructure;&#13;
(b) improvements in service delivery;&#13;
(c) increased capacities of community based organizations, district, provincial and&#13;
national government and NGO institutions to plan, appr.ise and complete capital&#13;
projects;&#13;
(d) recognition of critical role and value of self help in development and maintenance of&#13;
that development;&#13;
(e) rekindled spirit of self help, increased sense of ownership, accountability, participation&#13;
in decision making of their own development and empowerment of implementing&#13;
communities; and&#13;
(f) improved governance and accountability.&#13;
4.2    Poverty Monitoring. The specific benefits associated with the monitoring activities are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a) Improved poverty reduction content and impact of macro and sectoral policies;&#13;
(b) improved poverty reduction impact of programs and projects;&#13;
(c) enhanced capacity within Zambia for participatory research and planning, both&#13;
through the creation of the PAG and its training activities (likely to be focused at the&#13;
District level);&#13;
(d) the establishment in the LCMS of a statistical benchmark against which to assess&#13;
changes in the living conditions of different social groups;&#13;
(e) improved coordination of quantitative and participatory research and development&#13;
networks in Zambia; and&#13;
(f) establishment of a model, potentially replicable in other African countries, for the&#13;
integration of qualitative and participatory approaches into a poverty monitoring&#13;
system at the national level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
4.3    Poverty Analysis (Study Fund): The benefits of the poverty analysis will include the&#13;
folloving:&#13;
(a) appropriate and relevant policies;&#13;
(b) improved targeting of programs and policies, for the poor and vulnerable;&#13;
(c) improved research capacity; and&#13;
(d) more rigorous and analytical studies with appropriate and usable recommendations.&#13;
B. Monitorable Indicators&#13;
4.4    Community Initiatives. The benefits vill be monitored using indicators which will reflect&#13;
MPU output itself, the processes being developed by the project, the output of projects and the&#13;
impact of the micro-projects.&#13;
(a) MPU Output: disbursements, numbers of beneficiaries, numbers of projects ongoing,&#13;
numbers of completed projects, length of time between bench marks (application, desk&#13;
appraisal, field appraisal, approval, allocations, completion), numbers of workshops&#13;
and desk appraisal meetings will be indicators used to monitor the MPU output.&#13;
(b) Process Indicators: vill include the involvement of district staff and communities,&#13;
speed of completion, turn over of projects, technical quality of projects, financial&#13;
reporting by communities, reporting by district to provincial to national staff on MPU&#13;
projects and increased maintenance of infrastructure by communities.&#13;
(c) Project Output: output indicators vill include numbers of schools, clinics etc.&#13;
rehabilitated or constructed. km of road built, numbers of beneficiaries by age and sex&#13;
etc.&#13;
(d) Impact of the community initiatives: wvill be evaluated using the appraisal forms as&#13;
a bascline to establish the changes which have occurred as a result of the project. The&#13;
indicators mav be the change in numbers of pupils attending school, change in&#13;
numbers of trained teachers, grade 7 passes, change in levels of production, change in&#13;
volume of traffic, changes in income, household food security, personal security,&#13;
change in frequency of disease distance to safe drinking water etc.&#13;
(e) Beneficiary Assessment: the MPI) will contract the PAG to undertake a Beneficiary&#13;
Assessment 12 months after the Project starts.&#13;
4.5    Participatory Assessment Group. Monitorable indicators of success for the PAG 'Aill&#13;
focus on policy impact and evidence of widespread dissemination. These wvill include:&#13;
(a) reference to reports and other disseminated material from the PAG in policy&#13;
documents produced within government, operational NGOs and donor agencies;&#13;
(b) use of outputs provided by the PAG in reorienting and fine-tuning the design of survey&#13;
activities carried out by thc LCMU;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
(c) demand in terms of requests from policy makers for specific investigations on policy-&#13;
related issues from the PAG;&#13;
(d) uptake of recommendations in PAG reports by policy makers in government, donor&#13;
agencies and NGOs;&#13;
(e) demand in terms of requests from operational agencies involved in poverty reduction&#13;
projects for services of pre-project identification, monitoring or training - and uptake&#13;
of recommendations provided to such projects by the PAG, or adoption of planning&#13;
methodologies in which the agencies have received training.&#13;
4.6    Living Conditions Monitoring Survey. The LCMS will be monitored through the time&#13;
elapsed between the collection of data and the publishing of the annual survey report, and the&#13;
numbe of requests made for data from the survey.&#13;
4.7    Poverty Analysis (Study Fun(l) Component. The output of this component will be&#13;
monitored through dishursements, number of studies approved and completed, number of&#13;
researchers involved. The processes being developed will be monitored through the number of&#13;
seminars and commissioned studies.&#13;
C. Project Risks&#13;
4.8    The risks are.:&#13;
(a) That the Government of Zambia will fail to meet its financial commitments to the&#13;
project while budgetary constraints put pressure on all sectors. Inspite of these&#13;
pressures, the Govcrnment met its financial commitment to the project in full for 1994.&#13;
As SRPI demonstrated its approach assists communities to undertake their own&#13;
development, interest in the project, and commitment by Government increased.&#13;
(b) Political pressures may be brought to bear on the staff of the MPU, especially in the&#13;
run-up to the 1996 elections. The danger of being politically highjacked is reduced by&#13;
the MPU's strict adherence to its technocratic criteria in the selection of micro-&#13;
projects. The decision whether to fund a microproject or not lies with the District&#13;
Appraisal Committee and not with MPU staff alone.&#13;
(c) The community self help spirit may be undermined by other programmes and projects&#13;
not using the same clear criteria in project selection nor insisting on self help. The&#13;
Project will assist the Government in the development and implementation of a policy&#13;
which would eliminate such a risk.&#13;
(d) External shocks (drought, economic) to the implementing communities may result in&#13;
weakening their capacity to contribute to their projects. The drought of 1991/2 showed&#13;
that communities continued to contribute to their projects. In some cases, unskilled&#13;
labour was paid for and this may be considered on a case by case basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
(e) Poor technical quality of the wvorks could undermine the sustainability of the micro-&#13;
projects and community participation. This is being addressed by the significant&#13;
increase in technical monitoring and supervision. The Project Implementation Manual&#13;
will be made available to all micro-project committees. Regional Officers will be&#13;
trained in technical appraisal skills to ensure better quality at entry.&#13;
4.9    The risks especially associated wvith the participatory poverty monitoring component are&#13;
the following:&#13;
(a) the PAG may fail to constitute itself as a cohesive and effective non-governmental&#13;
development organisation;&#13;
(b) key staff (including trained researchers) may leave the PAG to take up positions&#13;
elsewhere; and&#13;
(c) the policy context in Zambia becomes too unstable to allow for incorporation of inputs&#13;
of information and recommendations from the PAG into processes of planning and&#13;
policy formulation.&#13;
These risks are minimised by the interest being shown in the PAG by Government and Donors,&#13;
and the high demand for its services.&#13;
4.10   The risks associated with the Living Conditions Monitoring Survey are that:&#13;
(a) the capacity of the Central Statistics Office will be inadequate to sustain the&#13;
component once the external support is withdrawvn, and&#13;
(b) the CSO budget may not provide adequate resources for effective implementation of&#13;
data collection and analysis, thereby reducing the credibility of the instrument&#13;
Under the Public Services Reform Program, Government recognises the importance of the CSO,&#13;
and is gradually increasing its budgetarv support.&#13;
4.1 1   The risk associated with the povertv anal)ysis component is that the local research&#13;
community and the policv makers do not make use of the facilities offered by the poverty analysis&#13;
component, which could undermine its existence. The risk is minimised by the high profile it&#13;
currentlv enjovs, continued advertising of its outputs and sensitisation to its existence.&#13;
4.12   A final risk to the smooth implementation of the Project would be the possibility of&#13;
Government yielding to pressures from Donors to modify procedures. Slow disbursements, erratic&#13;
release of donor funds, and burdensome reporting requirements occasionally hampered&#13;
implementation of SRP I. This risk will be dealt wvith b) ensuring that sufficient funding is&#13;
available to the MPU from IDA and Government sources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

-43-&#13;
Chapter 5: AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
A. Conditions&#13;
5.1    As a condlition of effcctivencss of thc IDA credit, the Government will have demonstrated&#13;
that at least half of the 1995 budget allocation for the Social Recovery Program has been disbursed&#13;
to the MPU (pars 2.3); and&#13;
5.2    As a condition of effectiveness of the Norvegian Grant for tue LCMU, the Government&#13;
will have presented a report showing all the proposed and ongoing activities for the CSO including&#13;
detailed work-prograrns and coordination mechanisms in a form and with a content acceptable to&#13;
IDA (para 2.46).&#13;
B. Agreements&#13;
5.3    To ensure smooth implementation of the project, the Government has agreed to:&#13;
(a) designate the MPU as the responsible agency for implementation of the program and&#13;
of the IDA credit in support thercof (para 2.14);&#13;
(b) staff the MPU with persons with qualifications and terms of reference acceptable to&#13;
IDA throughout project implementation (para 2.15);&#13;
(c) carry out all procurement (i) using standard bidding and contract documents for the&#13;
project and (ii) according to the arrangements laid out in paras. 3.4 - 3.12;&#13;
(d) ensure that all applications to withdraw proceeds from the credit will be fully&#13;
documented, except for expenditures for training, workslhops, recurrent costs, and for&#13;
contracts with a value of US$ 100,000 or less for goods and services and a value of&#13;
US$250,000 or less for civil works for which reimbursement may be made against&#13;
certified statements of expenditure (SOEs). Supporting documentation will be retained&#13;
by the MPU and will be available for review as requested by IDA supervision missions&#13;
and project auditors (para 3.16)&#13;
(e) ensure that the tax obligations of the project will be met annually through the timely&#13;
provision of the Goverrnmcnt counterpart funding (para 3.14);&#13;
(f) prior to June I of every year (beginning in 1996), present a progress report on&#13;
implementation of the Program (as outlined in Annex 6);&#13;
(g) adopt Project reporting, auditing and monitoring procedures acceptable to IDA and&#13;
prepare and submit in a timelv manner financial reports and external audits no later&#13;
than six months after the end of the financial year (para 3.17); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-&#13;
(h) carry out a mid-term review of the project not less than 30 months and not more than&#13;
36 months after the project becomes effective o: when 50 percent of the funds have&#13;
been committed, whichever comes first. At the mid-term review, Government will&#13;
present a plan for IDA's approval which will set out how the functions and&#13;
administrative machinery of the Social Recovery Project will be maintained after&#13;
completion of the Project (para 2.71).&#13;
C. Recommendation&#13;
5.4    On the basis of the above actions, conditions and agreements, the proposed project would&#13;
be suitable for an IDA credit of US $30 million equivalent.&#13;

Annex 2&#13;
THE PARTICIPATORY ASSESSMENT GROUP (PAG)&#13;
I.     Background&#13;
1.     The use of participatory and qualitative research methods and rapid rural or urban&#13;
appraisals are becoming increasingly common. Many donors, NGOs and governument Ministries&#13;
are now utilising participatory and qualitative research techniques to ensure that project&#13;
interventions are more closcly attuned to the needs and preferences of the poor, thereby improving&#13;
the chances of project effectiveness and impact. The Study Fund component of SRP 1&#13;
commissioned three Beneficiary Assessments for the monitoring and evaluation of SRP&#13;
microproject activities from the perspective of the beneficiaries. Assessments were carried out at&#13;
regular intervals from 1992 onwards and results fed into the improvement of SRP procedures and&#13;
systems.'9 Material from the Beneficiary Assessments have been utilised by other donor agencies,&#13;
NGOs and GRZ. The beneficiary assessment team has also undertaken the Participatory Poverty&#13;
Assessment, the results of which formed Volume 5 of the Poverty Assessment for Zambia.20&#13;
2.     The experience of the SRP-sponsored Beneficiary Assessments and the Zambia Poverty&#13;
Assessment has shown that the use of participatory research methods provides a highly valuable&#13;
complement to more conventional forms of programme monitoring and poverty analysis and in&#13;
itself plays an important role, contributing to community empowerment in the context of&#13;
microproject management.&#13;
3.     The Participatory Assessment Group has grown out of these experiences, and will provide&#13;
a means of continuing these valuable functions in a climate which will encourage their long term&#13;
sustainabilitv after the project is completed.&#13;
II.    Introduction&#13;
4.     The Participatorv Assessment Group has been registered as an independent Zambian non-&#13;
profit organisation. The following workplan refers only to the PAG's activities for the second&#13;
Social Recovery Project in Zambia. It is assumed that at times when not required for the following&#13;
workplan PAG personnel will be free to wvork on other PAG activities aside from those sponsored&#13;
by the project. This workplan is seen as indicative - meaning that the program is open for&#13;
adaptation in the light of the evolution of the priorities of the SRP2 as determined by its managers.&#13;
Ill.    Objectives&#13;
5.     The specific objectives and responsibilities of the PAG with regard to SRP 2 are:&#13;

(b)    to improve the impact, poverty targeting and operational effectiveness of poverty&#13;
reduction projects through support to pre-project identification, training in&#13;
participatory planning, and participatory monitoring and evaluation as requested,&#13;
and providing practical recommendations to project managers on the basis of these&#13;
exercises&#13;
Dissemination, Training and Development&#13;
(a)    to improve the quality of poverty reduction activities at the District level through&#13;
the dissemination of research findings, and the provision of training and&#13;
facilitation services for District Development Coordinating Committees&#13;
(b)    to provide training and support to a wider community in the country (research,&#13;
donor, NGO, GRZ) including a strong link, particularly in methodology, with the&#13;
research community at UNZA, thereby supporting efforts to enhance research&#13;
capacity in Zambia&#13;
(c)    to contribute towards better integration of the network of participation&#13;
practitioners through dissemination, workshops, training and the collation and&#13;
synthesis of messages from other relevant qualitative and participatory research on&#13;
poverty issues in Zambia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Particular emphasis is placed on the integration of the qualitative with the quantitative components&#13;
of the poverty monitoring system.&#13;
IV.   Workplan&#13;
6.     The following schedule outlines the major field exercises the team will be involved in over&#13;
the course of the project. A variety of ongoing activities are also identified which are outlined&#13;
below.&#13;
The activities identified consist of four different types:&#13;
(a)  Participatory Poverty Monitoring Exercises. These relate to objectives (a) through&#13;
to (d) identified under poverty monitoring above. They are field-based surveys using&#13;
primarily participatory research methods of the PRA (Participatory Rapid Appraisal)&#13;
family. The model for these exercises is the 1993 Participatory Poverty Assessment,&#13;
which had considerable influence on the formulation of the World Bank's country&#13;
program in Zambia through its impact on the Action Plan of the Poverty Assessment&#13;
(World Bank 1994). These exercises involve the whole of the PAG, as it is currently&#13;
constituted (i.e. two field teams of four-five researchers each, the PAG Director, Dr.&#13;
Milimo, and all support and logistical staff) for the period of the fieldwork, which is&#13;
approximately two months. For a further period of one month the services of the core&#13;
team are required for report preparation.&#13;
(b)    SRP Beneficiary Assessment Exercises. These focus on monitoring and evaluation&#13;
of the two Social Recovery Projects. They relate to objective (a) identified under the&#13;
project monitoring above. They are assumed to involve the whole of the field team&#13;
of the PAG for the periods specified for fieldwork (generally between one and two&#13;
months) with further time allocated for analysis and report writing. The model for&#13;
these exercises are the three BA's carried out under SRP 1.&#13;
(c)    District Level Training and Participatory Planning Exercises. These are a new&#13;
activity. They relate to objective (b) under project monitoring, and objective (a)&#13;
under dissemination, training and development, identified above. The overall aim&#13;
is both to develop the capacity of the SRP's District level teams, and to improve the&#13;
targeting of vulnerable communities as well as the quality of micro-project&#13;
identification. This work is assumed to involve three stages: training of the District&#13;
teams in participatory planning methods; identification of vulnerable communities;&#13;
pre-identification work using participatory planning methods wvith the communities&#13;
identified. It is anticipated that the PAG will engage in this work in two teams of&#13;
four, covering one District each every two eceks.&#13;
(d)    Thematic Studies. These rclate to objectives (c) and (e) identified under poverty&#13;
monitoring abovc. They arc to be identified in a process of collaboration with&#13;
stakeholdcrs from government (policy-makers), donor agencies and key actors in&#13;
civil society (academics, NGOs etc.). Other parts of the SRP2 are critical to this&#13;
process of identification including the Policy Coordinating Committee and the&#13;
Research Adviser to the Study Fund. The recent study into cost-sharing issues&#13;
commissioned by SIDA is an example of this type of exercise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-&#13;
7.     In terms of administrative arrangcmcnts, items (a), (b) and (c) will be supported as part of&#13;
the core ludget identified for the PAG's activities, and presented at the end of this workplan. These&#13;
funds will be disbu-sed through the Institution Building and Support component of the SRP. The&#13;
funds wvill be disbursed against specified outputs (studies, training courses, workshops etc.), except&#13;
for certain capacitv-building items suclh as capital costs, and costs of training inputs provided for&#13;
the team wvhich will be funded dircctly. The thematic studies (item d) will be supported through the&#13;
Study Fund and identificd on an ongoing basis. Only one has been programmed below as this is&#13;
already identified - it is assumed that others wvill bc developed, and supported during the life of the&#13;
project. The PAG does not have a projected budget for these under its core activities as they will&#13;
be commniss:oned through the Study Fund - it xvill howvever receive some support to the&#13;
identification and development of such study proposals under its core budget.&#13;
V.    Proposed Activities Programme&#13;
1995: Major Activities&#13;
The start-up date of the project is August I st.&#13;
August-September 1995          A thematic study is likely to be commissioned under&#13;
the Study Fund into the functioning of the Public&#13;
Welfare Assistance Scheme&#13;

(activity suipported under core budget)&#13;
1996: Major Activities&#13;
January-March 1996             In this period it is likely that a Beneficiary Assessment&#13;
for the European Union micro-projects program will be&#13;
commissioned&#13;

(activity sutpported uinder core budget)&#13;
April-May                      District-level training and participatory planning&#13;
exercises (covering eight Districts)&#13;
(activity supported under core budget)&#13;
October-December               Participatory Poverty Monitoring Exercise&#13;
(2.5 months - activity supported under core budget)&#13;
Ongoing Activities:&#13;
8.     A variety of activities will be carried out either throughout the year, or at intervals but are&#13;
too short to allowv for inclusion in the schedule above. The are listed belowv, along with the time&#13;
that it is anticipated each activity will take up:&#13;
(a)  ,Skills Development anid Training for the Team. The team will need upgrading of&#13;
skills and opportunities for regular learning. The following areas have been identified:&#13;
training in research methods (cspeciallv PRA) - at least once every 18 months; training&#13;
in proposal and report writing (once every 18 months); training in computing and&#13;
word-processing (some members only); experiential learning opportunities (members&#13;
of the team to join other organisations practicing participatory research and planning&#13;
methods for short periods): basic book keeping (the administrative secretary plus one&#13;
team member); gender planning methodologies. It is anticipated that this activity will&#13;
take up two-three weeks per ycar.&#13;
(b) Training of Other Zambian Researchers and Practitioners. Once a year the PAG&#13;
ill organise an open training session in participatory policy research and planning&#13;
methods wvhich can be attended by students, government staff and NGO personnel.&#13;
This activity will contribute to objective (b) under Dissemination, Training and&#13;
Development above. This activity should take around seven days per year for&#13;
four/five team members (plus time for administration, preparation and planning).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51l-&#13;
(c)   Technical Assistance, Operational Missions and Project Meetings. Although the&#13;
principal burden here will fall on the Director and other core team members,&#13;
experience has shown that it is cssential for all members of the PAG to be involved in&#13;
some e-ents (eg. key strategic planning meetings). This activity will take about three&#13;
weeks per year of the Director's time, and one week per year of the full team's time.&#13;
(d)  Process Time. This refers to key tasks such as developing proposals for thematic&#13;
studKis in dialogue with policy-makers, management and administrative tasks not&#13;
covered by budgets for specific activities. This activity refers primarily to the core&#13;
team, and should comprise around one-two weeks per year.&#13;
(e)  Dissemination. This refers primarily to dissemination of the results of the&#13;
Participatory Poverty Monitoring exercises, as it is assumed that budgets for thematic&#13;
studies will cover this item. Two weeks per year should be allowed for this.&#13;
(f)  Netvorking and Synthesis of Materialfrom Other Participatory Research in&#13;
Zambia. This refers to objective (c) under Disseminati,n, Training and&#13;
Development. It will take up one-two weeks per year of the team's time.&#13;
9.     The exact accounting for this time in terms of the team as a whole is complex, as many of&#13;
these activities involve different team members for different periods of time. Allowance has been&#13;
made for all of the above in the budget presented below. Again, it should be emphasized that tasks&#13;
identified above carried out in relation to thematic studies, or studies commissioned outside the&#13;
SRP2, should be budgeted for in those specific proposals.&#13;
10.    As a guide, we can assume that the PAG as a whole will be engaged in the above activities&#13;
for approximately two months per year during the period 1995-1996, dropping to 1.5 months a&#13;
year in the last hvo years of the project. A similar falling off in the time allocations has been&#13;
programmed under the allowances for the major activities. This is based on an assumption that the&#13;
PAG will be able to improve its productivity as it gains experience and develops capacity to fulfill&#13;
the role identified in the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

VI.   SRP2 Related Activities&#13;
Under the workplan outlined above. the PAG is committed for the following periods of time during&#13;
the course of SRP2:&#13;
Year I (August-December 1995)               major activities:   3 months&#13;
ongoing activities:   I month&#13;
total:            4 months&#13;
Year 2 (1996)                               major activities:   8 months&#13;
ongoing activities:   2 months&#13;
total:           10 months&#13;
Year 3 (1997)                               major activities:   6.5 months&#13;
ongoing activities:  1.5 months&#13;
total:            8 months&#13;
Year 4 (1998)                               major activities:    7.5 months&#13;
ongoing activities:   1.5 months&#13;
total              9 months&#13;
Additional pieces of work may be commissioned under the study fund (see thematic studies, above)&#13;
VIl.  The Participatory Assessment Group - Resources, Organisation and Structure&#13;
I L.    As an independent organisation the PAG is to determine its own structure and mode of&#13;
operation. This structure, however, has to be capable of delivering the workplan outlined here. The&#13;
management of the SRP2 will engage in discussions with the PAG concerning resources and&#13;
organisational structure to the extent that it affects delivery of the program outlined here.&#13;
12.   It is currently anticipated that the PAG will have a core team of full-time staff. This will&#13;
include the Coordinator/Executive Secretary (Dr. Milimo) and four full-time professional program&#13;
staff (two men and two women). One of these will be the deputy Executive Secretary, who will&#13;
take responsibility for day-to-day management and administration, as well as deputising for the&#13;
Coordinator when he is awav.&#13;
13.    The Coordinator will have overall responsibility for assuring the quality of the PAG's&#13;
outputs and will therefore concentrate on overseeing the PAG's policy research, operational and&#13;
training functions. The three remaining full-time professional staff will be given responsibility for&#13;
developing activities in the fields of training, policy research, and networking, respectively. There&#13;
will be a full-time administrative assistant and a driver.&#13;
14.    There will also be five research officers who will be members of PAG staff on a part-time&#13;
basis (three women and two men). These staff members will be employed for operational tasks&#13;
such as training and research exercises. Additional staff (researchers, drivers) will be taken on a&#13;
contract basis as required.&#13;

IX.   Budget notes&#13;
(a)  The above costs cover only the core activities identified in the workplan.&#13;
(b)  Thematic studies would be financed over and above these budgets from the Study Fund.&#13;
(c)  Costs are for the portion of the year that the PAG is assumed to be engaged on the above&#13;
core activities - all costs, including basic recurrent expenditures, are expected to be&#13;
budgeted for in periods when not working for the SRP2 in the contracts arranged with&#13;
other funders.&#13;
(d)  Some of these costs will be paid directly to the PAG - these relate to activities essential&#13;
for developing the PAG's capacity to carry out the workplan, and will cover the capital&#13;
and start-up costs, as well as costs incurred when the PAG members themselves are&#13;
being trained. Other activities (i.e. when there is an identifiable direct output - eg. a&#13;
study, a workshop etc.) will be contracted through the micro-projects unit, with&#13;
guarantees of performnance and accountability assured through the contracting&#13;
arrangements. This latter arrangement will cover at least 80% of the costs outlined&#13;
below over the four years of activities in this workplan.&#13;
(e)  Salary costs are inclusive of 35% income tax.&#13;
(f)  In preparation for the mid-term review, the PAG will submit a report to the SRP2&#13;
Steering Committee at the beginning of 1997 which will contain an analysis of work&#13;
done for the SRP2 and other clients, a statement and analysis of income from sources&#13;
outside the project, the proposed annual budgets for the remaining years of the project,&#13;
and a finance plan indicating how the Group proposes to attain independent&#13;
sustainability by project completion.&#13;

Annex 3&#13;
LIVING CONDITIONS MONITORING SURVEY&#13;
Introduction&#13;
I .    There has been a long-felt need for monitoring the effects of policy decisions and external&#13;
factors (e.g. drought) on the welfare of different groups of the population. The Living Conditions&#13;
Monitoring Survey (LCMS) has been designed to replace the ad-hoc monitoring activities of the&#13;
past few years. The Central Statistical Office in Lusaka has established a Living conditions&#13;
Monitoring Unit (LCMU) which will coordinate several survey activities thus creating a&#13;
harmonized, standardized and cost-effective process for the production of social statistics.&#13;
2.     The Living Conditions Monitoring Survey (LCMS), the Food Security Nutrition and&#13;
Health Monitoring System (FHANIS), and the Household Budget Survey (HBS), will constitute&#13;
the core survey activities in the Unit. The systematic collection of statistical data in relevant&#13;
Ministries, such as the Ministries of Health and Education, will also be coordinated with activities&#13;
of the LCMU.&#13;
3.     The LCMS program will build on the experience and capacities acquired in the Central&#13;
Statistics Office through its monitoring activities during SRP1. An evaluation of the Priority&#13;
Surveys (1991, 1993) recommended the following changes in future surveys:&#13;
* more focus on the social sphere of living conditions&#13;
*  user-producer workshops to identify information needs&#13;
* application of smaller and more manageable samples&#13;
* more appropriate questionnaires&#13;
* improved routines for quality control in the field&#13;
long-term technical assistance to secure continuity&#13;
* maintenance of continuity and consistency with data already collected through PS I&#13;
and PS 11&#13;
* improved coordination of social statistics monitoring within the CSO&#13;
* more effective advertising of data availability.&#13;
The SRP2 project will finance successive rounds of the LCMS on a sliding scale which is planned&#13;
to end after four years when the Unit is expected to be fully supported by GOZ.&#13;
The LCMS - An Annual Modular Survey Program&#13;
4.     The monitoring program will be designed on a modular platform. A core module, repeated&#13;
annually, will include a set of priority indicators. Extensive contact and interaction with potential&#13;
users of the living conditions survey data is built into the preparatory process to identify and&#13;
suggest the priority indicators. A major concern will be that the indicators should provide&#13;
substantive information, wvhile being easily recorded. Interviews should not take more than 30 - 40&#13;
minutes.&#13;
5.     As need arises, modules covering additional dimensions, or expanding on those in the core&#13;
module, could be added, based on a request from a Ministry responsible for a particular aspect of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-58-&#13;
social sector development, or any other involved agency, either on an ad hoc basis, or at regular&#13;
intervals. In addition, specified target groups can be given special attention, both by extending the&#13;
sample or by giving them an extended questionnaire, specifically designed to elicit data on their&#13;
situation. In this way the LCMS can provide information which monitors changes on an annual&#13;
basis, while having the flexibility to respond to urgent issues raised by users and other parties.&#13;
6.     The main objectives of this system can be summnarized as follows:&#13;
(a) to give rapid, reliable information on key indicators of living conditions on an annual&#13;
basis;&#13;
(b) to serve as a national baseline from which surveys covering vulnerable groups, special&#13;
items or geographical areas can be launched,&#13;
(c) to give different users a system of social indicators by which to monitor development;&#13;
(d) to provide a flexible and cost-effective data collection system, which is comparable and&#13;
standardized,&#13;
(e) to coordinate social statistics collected within the CSO as well as by relevant Ministries,&#13;
such as the Ministries of Health and Education.&#13;
Sampling&#13;
7.     Sample size and sampling frame will be important issues during the planning stage. The&#13;
sample should be large enough to allow for data to be desegregated to provincial level, and&#13;
preferably to rural/urban areas within the provinces. A deep stratification is recommended. As a&#13;
minimum, considering stratification after level of centrality, administrative level, agro-ecological&#13;
zones, but also disease exposure, primary' school coverage, physical infrastructure, composition of&#13;
the work force etc. as far as information allow for. The sample should permnit the data to be broken&#13;
down by the most relevant socio-economic background factors. This should be possible even with a&#13;
considerable decrease in sample size when compared to the Priority Surveys. The sampling frame&#13;
should be developed on the basis of final Census results and should coincide with the agricultural&#13;
sampling frame as far as the different objectives allow. (One approach to consider would be to&#13;
extend the Crop Forecasting survey sample in order to obtain a common or highly overlapping&#13;
master sample).&#13;
Relationship to Participatory Assessment&#13;
8.     A special feature of the new monitoring component of the SRP will be the interplay&#13;
between qualitative and quantitative approaches in analyzing social processes and social&#13;
phenomena. This is rcflccted in the way the monitoring component of SRP2 is organized (see figure&#13;
1). The institutional framework and management structure of the LCMU and PAG is designed to&#13;
secure exchange and cooperation betwecn the diffcrent methodologies employed. Mutual&#13;
representation on the technical committces of the two units will ensure exchange of information on&#13;
activities, plans, findings and research questions. It is hoped that the two units will be located near&#13;
each other so that infornal exchange and cooperation between the two units will occur.&#13;
9.     The LCMU needs input from the PAG particularly in the planning stage of a survey. The&#13;
Participatory Assessment of 1993 did follow-up studies and provided in-depth explanations to&#13;
several questions which were raised during the analysis of the PS 1. Through this experience a good&#13;
relationship and a cooperative tradition was established between the participatory and the&#13;
quantitative monitoring communities.&#13;

The first round of the LCMS&#13;
10.      The planning for the first round of the LCMS will need to be done very carefully, and it is&#13;
expected that the process will start in 1995.&#13;
Output From Round I of the LCMS&#13;
11.      The output from  the first round of the LCMS would be high quality data disseminated to&#13;
relevant user groups and made available for research activities both at the University and other&#13;
relevant agencies. The data set would be an important input for studies to be funded by the Study&#13;
fund.&#13;
(a) A cleaned data set will be released no later than 9 months after the end of the data&#13;
collection period.&#13;
(b) A tabulation report summarizing the most important results from the survey will be&#13;
produced by the CSO. This report will be presented (but not necessarily printed)&#13;
within a year after the data collection period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-60-&#13;
(c) The tabulation report will be followed by a policy relevant social report, produced by&#13;
the CSO in cooperation with relevant Ministries and other agencies. This report should&#13;
be presented before the release of the data from the next round.&#13;
This publication program should be an annual feature of the proposed system.&#13;
Planning Activities For Future Rounds of the LCMS&#13;
12.    To accomplish a cost-effective way of collecting social statistics, it is not only necessary to&#13;
thoroughly plan the LCMS, but also all other surveys covering the social dimensions in order to&#13;
ensure the desired comparability. This means that the whole set of social statistics of CSO has to&#13;
be looked into in the course of planning the LCMS, in order to be able to build a coherent&#13;
statistical system on social conditions. The core content of the LCMS should also be coordinated&#13;
with the collection of statistics going on and being planned in relevant Ministries, such as the&#13;
Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education. In this process it is very important that&#13;
definitions of concepts and standardization of background information are agreed, throughout the&#13;
different surveys, to enable monitoring of social development across groups and over time.&#13;
13.   In order to effectively carry out the proposed changes in the social statistics system, it is&#13;
also important to have an efficient programming infrastructure. In order to ensure the best possible&#13;
use of computer resources throughout the social statistical system, as well as for the rest of CSO, a&#13;
common soft-ware should be introduced. This also enhances the possibility of flexible use of data.&#13;
Survey Budget Phase, 1995-99&#13;
14.    The budget for the survey program to be carried out by CSO is as follows (costs are given&#13;
in '000 US, applying a rate of US I = ZKw 700): This budget is based on the following&#13;
assumptions: An annual household survey with something like a 30 minute household based&#13;
questionnaire, and a sample of about 5000. It covers four rounds of data collection in the proposed&#13;
survey system.&#13;
15.    This budget is for planning, personnel training and infrastructure, (including computers&#13;
and soft-ware both at Central and regional offices), fuel and two project vehicles. The budget also&#13;
includes funding for a long-term consultant for 24 months, which uill ensure that the consultant&#13;
will be able to follow the complete first round of the survey and data dissemination. The budget&#13;
also allows for short-term consultancies, for all three rounds and allowances for national experts.&#13;
16.    The cost of the field operations are calculated on the following basis:&#13;
* Interviewers: 2 months, 95 persons, K 100,000 each&#13;
* Data entry clerks: 48 days, 24 persons, K60,000 each&#13;
* Drivers: 2 months 19 persons, K200,000 each&#13;
* Supervisors: 48 days, 19 persons, K 200,000 each&#13;
17.   The initial contribution from thc Governmcnt of Zambia will be about US Dollar 9000 per&#13;
year. External sources will fund the remainder of the budget for the first two years. Government&#13;
will assume responsibility for an additional 25 percent in 1997, 50 percent in 1998, 75 percent in&#13;
1999, and 100 percent of the regular operation of the survey as of the year 2000.&#13;

Annex 4&#13;
TIlE POVERTY ANALYSIS (STUDY FUND) COMPONENT&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The main purpose of the Study Fund is the analysis of poverty issues and the effects of&#13;
economic policies on poor and vulnerable groups. The Study Fund aims to improve the&#13;
communication between the rcscarch community and the policy makers and implementors. It&#13;
encourages the analysis of existing data w hich is presented in a usable form to the ultimate users -&#13;
the policy makers. The Study Fund also aims to strengthen the capacity of existing Zambian&#13;
research institutions.&#13;
2.     The first study was financed in June 1992 undcr SRPI, and the first to be completed was&#13;
in January 1993. By December 1994, twenty-two studies had been completed, five were ongoing,&#13;
and several were at the proposal stage.&#13;
3.     As part of the mid term review of the Social Recovery Project 1, the Study Fund&#13;
commissioned an evaluation of its effectiveness in reaching its objectives. In summary, the&#13;
evaluation report found that the Study Fund had made major progress in building up viable&#13;
structures which ensure the operation of demand driven policy related research. The Study Fund&#13;
administration and Committee have put in place effective mechanisms for the selection and review&#13;
of studies. A dialogue between the research community and policy makers has been established,&#13;
and the Study Fund is increasingly bccoming known and accessible to Ministries and public&#13;
institutions.&#13;
4.     The evaluation found three main areas for furtlher devclopment:&#13;
(a) public institutions and ministrics nccd to be further involved in the identification of&#13;
research areas and the commissioning of studies;&#13;
(b) the procedures for selection and review research topics need to be further strengthened&#13;
so that the policv makers are increasingly involved in the study cycle to improve their&#13;
ownership of the studies and their results; and&#13;
(c)&#13;
the research teams need guidance in research methodologies, research topics and&#13;
presentation of research.&#13;
5.    It was also noted the Study Fund administration is increasingly becoming a resource center&#13;
for consultants, researchers, students and donors.&#13;
6.     The Study Fund plays an important role in providing action orientated research which is&#13;
relevant to po0icy makers and implcmentors. It is the only project of its kind in Zambia, and&#13;
interest and activity is increasing daily. The groundwvork has been done and the Study Fund&#13;
Committee procedures institutionalised.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Objectives of the Study Fund&#13;
7.     The main qim of the Study Fund is to support research and studies which focus on policy&#13;
related poverty issues. The specific objectives are:&#13;
(a) to identify the effects of social and economic policies on the poor and vulnerable.&#13;
Struztural adjustment economic and social policies have implications for all members&#13;
of society but affect some more than others. Government and donors are concerned&#13;
that these effects are understood by policy makers so that programmes which cushion&#13;
the effects of the policies can be implemented. Studies which address poverty issues&#13;
and the analysis of social and economic policies on the vulnerable are a priority;&#13;
(b) to assist in the formulation of policies and implementation of programmes; Studies&#13;
financed by the Study Fund are action oriented. Practical solutions are suggested to&#13;
policy makers and implementors of programmes. The research studies aim to assist in&#13;
the effective targeting of interventions to beneficiaries;&#13;
(c) to improve communication betveen researchers, policy makers, programme&#13;
implementors and target communities; the Study Fund aims to strengthen the linkages&#13;
betwveen the research community and the policy makers in Zambia by encouraging the&#13;
analysis of existing data by the research community and making the results available&#13;
to t'ie policv makers, in a usable form. for the benefit of vulnerable groups.&#13;
8.     Data and information exist in the records of ministries, local government, as well as&#13;
universities and research institutions. Rarely, however, is there time, capacity and funds available&#13;
to fully analyse this data and make it available in a usable form to policy makers. The Study Fund&#13;
makes resources available, strengthening the capacity of institutions to perform this task. The&#13;
Study Fund will finance government agencies, non-governmental organisations, research&#13;
institutions, private consultancics and individuals to undertake relevant studies.&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
9.     The Study Fund is administered by a Committee consisting of the donor, non-governmental&#13;
and research communities, and the Governmcnt of Republic of Zambia line ministries. This&#13;
Committee approves or rejects studies, decides research priority areas, determines criteria, assigns&#13;
reviewers, and sometimes commissions studies. It is supported by the Study Fund Secretariat.&#13;
10.    The Secretariat, based in Microprojects Unit of NCDP, assists with the co-ordination of&#13;
studies, administers the financing of studies, provides advice and some logistical support. The&#13;
secretariat initially appraises proposed studies according to criteria established by the Committee,&#13;
advises the researchers and co-ordinates the review process. The studies are then discussed by the&#13;
Study Fund Committee and, if accepted, financed.&#13;
11. The Study Fund has developed procedures, produced guidelines for researchers and a&#13;
Research Manual which guides researchers through research methods and presentation. Training&#13;
and dissemination workshops and seminars are organised and financed by the Study Fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-64-&#13;
12.    To further the objectives stated above, the Studv Fund will recruit a Study Fund Research&#13;
Advisor.&#13;
13.    The Studv Fund Research Advisor wvill initially screen proposals and advise researchers&#13;
before they reach the review process, strengthening the quality of research proposals. The Research&#13;
Advisor will be in constant contact with the planners and policy makers from the relevant&#13;
Ministries so that studies of contemporary issues are quickly commissioned. The Research&#13;
Advisor will also strengthen the review process, in order to improve the analytical and&#13;
methodological skills of the researchers. The Research Advisor will organise and coordinate the&#13;
research methodology workshops and research dissemination seminars. The Research Advisor will&#13;
also be expected to improve the dissemination processes of the studies financed by the Study Fund&#13;
throughout the country.&#13;
Action Programme - SRP2&#13;
14.    The Study Fund wvill continue to finance Priority Studies. Analysis of existing data will be&#13;
encouraged, especially that of Priority Survey 2 data and the Living Conditions Monitoring Survey&#13;
(LCMS). The main social sector ministries are intending to use the facilities of the Study Fund to&#13;
analyse existing data in order to enable them to target their programmes more effectively toward&#13;
the poor and vulnerable.&#13;
15.    For example, the Ministry of Health intends to undertake a Priority Study on the effects of&#13;
the user fees on the accessibility of health services. The Government of Zambia through the&#13;
Household Food Securitv Monitoring Project (FHANlS) has asked the Study Fund to finance a&#13;
study to evaluate the Food for Work Programmes to assist in the formulation of a policy. The&#13;
Ministry of Community Development and Social Services are presently developing a terms of&#13;
reference for a study which would assist them in development of criteria for safety net activities&#13;
and of monitoring indicators to assess the impact of these. It is expected that two Priority Studies&#13;
a year will be financed and completed.&#13;
16.    The Studv Fund wvill also continue to fund small studies.  By increasing the inputs of&#13;
research revieNvers and Study Fund personnel, it is hoped to increase the turn over of better quality&#13;
small studies to about ten a year.&#13;
Budget for Study Fund Component&#13;
Budget Notes:&#13;
(a) Studies and Consultants: It is assumed that given the increased capacity provided by a&#13;
qualified Research Advisor, the turn over of studies will increase to 2 Priority Studies&#13;
(average US$75,000 per studv), and 10 small studies per annum ( US$15,000 per&#13;
study)..&#13;
(b) Training and Dissemination: the Study Fund expects two independent reviewers per&#13;
study at an average of US$ I 50/reviewer/study. Dissemination workshops are&#13;
estimated to cost on average US$ I .000 /study. Report production, Research Manual&#13;
and Newsletter production will be included in this budget heading. The cost/study is on&#13;
average US$400 for the thirty copies needed for dissemination. The Research&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-65-&#13;
Methodology Workshops arc expected to a bi-annual event and is estimated to cost&#13;
US$500 each. Research seminars (10/annum) are estimated to cost US$250 each. A&#13;
5 percent contingencv has been added to cover the increased capacity as a research&#13;
resource centre.&#13;
(c) Admi iistration Costs: it is estimated that the Research Advisor will cost about&#13;
US$1,500 a month (US$18,000 per annum), including all expenses. The Research&#13;
Advisor will be supported by a secretary, about US$500 per month (US$6,000 per&#13;
annum). US$6,000 per annum is estimated to finance the running costs of a vehicle&#13;
and office equipment .&#13;
(d) Capital Start Up Expenses: it is proposed to procure a vehicle for the Study Fund&#13;
Research Advisor and a photocopier. Presently the Study Fund is dependent on the&#13;
Social Recoverv Project vehicles and equipment.&#13;

            Zambia - Second Social Recovery Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The aim of the Second Social Recovery
            Project is to assist the Government of Zambia's poverty
            reduction program through financing of community initiatives
            and building of capacity for poverty analysis and
            monitoring. The project will finance community initiatives
            which assist the poor and vulnerable to meet their own
            objectives during the adjustment period and thereby allow
            faster economic and social recovery. The community-based
            micro-projects will include the rehabilitation and
            improvement of existing infrastructure and social service
            delivery. The project will also improve the capacity of
            communities and government staff to plan, appraise, manage
            and maintain investment projects through the experience
            gained in such micro-projects. The project will also enhance
            the capacity of Zambian institutions to collect and analyze
            poverty related data. The beneficiary communities will be
            involved in the information gathering as well as in the
            planning, design and implementation of the micro-projects.
            The project will strengthen the communities' abilities
            to take charge of their own development, rekindle the spirit
            of self-help, and strengthen the capacities of the relevant
            institutions to gather, analyze and act on relevant
            information. In order to achieve its objectives the project
            will have three components. The first is a community
            initiatives component which will finance microprojects
            identified, prepared and implemented by communities with
            appraisal and supervision from the Microprojects Unit (MPU);
            a sub-component will finance capacity building in
            microprojects implementation and decentralized government
            agencies. The second component will finance capacity
            building and data collection through a Living Conditions
            Monitoring Survey (LCMS) and a systematic participatory
            monitoring and assessment system. The last component will
            finance policy relevant research on poverty and social
            issues in a demand-driven framework, building on the success
            of the Study Fund under the First Social Recovery project.
