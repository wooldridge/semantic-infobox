                                   INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
Following the acknowledged failure of state-owned development banks or credit&#13;
components of agricultural development projects established during the 1970s, new&#13;
alternative financial services were introduced in rural areas during the 1980s. These are&#13;
based on various forms of banking arrangements, cooperatives, mutual benefit societies&#13;
and solidarity groups, the overall objective of which has been to accommodate the&#13;
needs and capacities of population groups which until then had been denied access to&#13;
traditional types of financing. An analysis of these structures indicates that they have&#13;
generally attracted a sizable clientele and that they have had a good loan recovery&#13;
record. However, they have had to contend with two issues: first, how to manage their&#13;
sustainability and their expansion to an extent sufficient to have an impact on&#13;
development and, second, how to become integrated into the broader financial system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The constraints involved managing risk in an often imperfect market, meeting the&#13;
challenges of competition, controlling costs and managing resources to ensure financial&#13;
equilibrium, and adapting to a formal institutional environment.&#13;
&#13;
In analyzing these institutions, Governments, donors and researchers face many&#13;
questions for which few answers have yet been provided. What will the future place and&#13;
role of these new alternatives be within the formal and informal financial sectors? Will&#13;
they be sufficiently developed, stable, and efficient to meet the needs of rural&#13;
populations? What role should Governments play? To what extent is government&#13;
intervention justified? What regulatory structure should be established to protect&#13;
macroeconomic stability and clients while simultaneously allowing efficient operations?&#13;
&#13;
The case of Indonesia offers very useful insight for answers to these questions in three&#13;
respects. In political and economic terms, since President Suharto came to power in&#13;
1967, development has followed two paths. The first, which lasted until 1983, was&#13;
characterized by state intervention, while the second, which began in 1984 and&#13;
continues today, has been more liberal. In terms of financial policy, Indonesia has set&#13;
out an original path for the liberalization of its financial system by profoundly&#13;
transforming the network of state entities and defining a legal framework that specifically&#13;
targets the development of small rural banks. Finally, in institutional terms, the rural&#13;
financial system now includes many highly diversified institutions serving rural&#13;
households. These in turn offer a multitude of case studies on the provision of&#13;
alternative financial services.&#13;
&#13;
Answers to some of the questions posed above may be found in an analysis of the&#13;
structure of Indonesia's rural financial system. This study will explore:&#13;
&#13;
   1) the rural financial institutions which have emerged, prospered, or declined during&#13;
       the various periods of state intervention and liberalization and the factors which&#13;
       determined their behavior;&#13;
   2) how the rural financial system is organized and how it strives for stability and&#13;
       efficiency; and&#13;
   3) the Government's role in this evolution.&#13;
&#13;
The study will analyze how effectively these organizations have performed their role as&#13;
agents of Indonesia's economic growth (availability of resources, volume and quality of&#13;
investments, resource allocation and appropriation). Within the context of an economy&#13;
incorporating a multitude of new institutions, the study will take into account the&#13;
imperfect nature of financial markets (characterized by such factors as asymmetric&#13;
information, moral hazard, and adverse selection) which leads institutions to adopt&#13;
certain procedures (search for information and incentive mechanisms) (Bardhan, 1989;&#13;
Hoff et al., 1993; Stiglitz, 1986) and may justify some government intervention in order&#13;
to ensure the efficient operation of the financial system (Besley, 1994; Stiglitz, 1992).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
METHODOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
This analysis is based on secondary data on Indonesia's economy and financial system&#13;
and on information gathered in interviews with key individuals in the institutions' main&#13;
offices in Jakarta.1&#13;
&#13;
In order to clarify these data, two fields of study were selected in West Java, a province&#13;
where the development of the financial system has been very dynamic. The target&#13;
areas were the districts of Bogor and Tasikmalaya. Although their economies are very&#13;
similar, their financial institutions have developed along sharply different lines over time.&#13;
Suffice it to say that, since the 1970s, Tasikmalaya's rural financial institutions have&#13;
grown rapidly2, although very few new private rural banks have been established. In&#13;
Bogor, however, very few small financial institutions were established until the&#13;
liberalization of the financial system in 1988, and many new rural banks are now being&#13;
established. The analysis of the reasons for these differences will enable the reader to&#13;
understand what factors have spurred the creation of local institutions. One institution of&#13;
each type3, for a total of 12, was surveyed in each field of study; demand was assessed&#13;
by conducting two rapid series of household surveys (approximately 40 surveys in each&#13;
region).&#13;
&#13;
The study begins with the history of Indonesia's rural financial system; next, based on&#13;
case studies in West Java, it evaluates the factors underlying the system's efficiency&#13;
and dynamism and then turns to the role of the State; the third part analyzes the&#13;
demand for financial services in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
THE HISTORY OF INDONESIA'S RURAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM&#13;
Indonesia is a vast archipelago comprising 13,000 islands on both sides of the equator&#13;
and spanning an area of 2,000 km from north to south and 5,000 km from east to west.&#13;
Although this vastness endows Indonesia with a rich variety of land- and sea-based&#13;
resources, it also makes the country - a divided territory scattered across the Indian&#13;
Ocean - difficult to manage. In addition to being geographically vast, Indonesia has a&#13;
population of 190 million, a heterogeneous mix comprising 366 ethnic groups with&#13;
different languages, religions, and customs. Most of the population (100 million) lives on&#13;
Java, Bali and Madura (which account for less than 10 percent of Indonesia's territory),&#13;
resulting in population densities - some 800 inhabitants/km2 - which are among the&#13;
highest in the world.&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia is among the East Asian countries which have been experiencing sustained&#13;
economic growth for many years. It is able to rely on its resources as well as on the&#13;
steady growth of its infrastructure and human resources, within a stable and highly&#13;
structured political and social environment. If rapid growth is to continue, Indonesia&#13;
must come to grips with the serious challenges facing it in terms of job creation and&#13;
economic diversification . Moreover, Indonesia has not been spared by the current&#13;
financial crisis in Asia and must take into account political and social dangers which&#13;
may worsen in the coming years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
From the colonial Period to the Interventionist Era&#13;
of the Suharto Government&#13;
&#13;
During the colonial period, until 1945, the financial system consisted of seven large&#13;
commercial banks, all of them foreign. The three largest were Dutch institutions. There&#13;
were only a few Indonesian institutions: BKDs and BRI. BKDs, or village banks and&#13;
granaries (Badan Kredit Desa), sought to free small farmers from the grip of usurers,&#13;
who had been condemned by the colonial powers. There were many such institutions in&#13;
Java (in the rice-producing great plains) and, by the beginning of the twentieth century,&#13;
there were more than 20,000 (Suharto, 1985). They still exist today, but in more limited&#13;
numbers (5,300 in 1993). BRI, a national state bank, was established during the Dutch&#13;
colonial period in 1895 and operates at the district level. Until 1968 it primarily served&#13;
civil servants and, on occasion, farmers or entrepreneurs.&#13;
&#13;
During Sukarno's tenure (1945-1966), the banking system was almost completely&#13;
nationalized and centralized, and it did not function smoothly. An economic crisis,&#13;
coupled with a grave political crisis, paved the way for the violent transition which&#13;
brought General Suharto to power in 1966.&#13;
&#13;
The Suharto Government faced a critical economic situation from the outset. During the&#13;
initial intervention phase beginning in 1967, the Government's efforts to restore&#13;
Indonesia to financial and monetary health focused primarily on combating inflation.&#13;
Following the stifling of the financial system during the Sukarno era, efforts were made&#13;
to foster the growth of financial services, particularly through the establishment of&#13;
regional development banks. Established during the 1960s, these banks4 were operated&#13;
by the provincial governments (which provided them with funds) and helped to finance&#13;
regional economic policies. Located in each provincial capital, there were 27 of them,&#13;
one for every Indonesian province, and by 1970 there were nearly 300 "people's credit&#13;
banks"5 (BPR, Bank Perkreditan Rakyat) at the district level.&#13;
&#13;
Although Indonesia was a major rice-importing country, in 1969 the Government&#13;
announced the ambitious objective of making Indonesia self-sufficient in rice production.&#13;
The "green revolution" was launched primarily on Java and was intended to spur&#13;
Indonesia's growth by heavily favoring agricultural development. At the same time,&#13;
however, the financial system was again subject to severe restrictions, particularly on&#13;
entry into the sector. Beginning in 1969 no new licenses were issued to foreign banks. A&#13;
1970 decree prevented all new private banks from opening and imposed heavy&#13;
restrictions on the opening of new branches. The Government used the credit policy of&#13;
national state banks to manage Indonesia's economic development process through&#13;
complex mechanisms relating to targeted credit and ceilings.&#13;
&#13;
BRI thus became the predominant institution in rural areas at the expense of the&#13;
provincial government banks. With the advent of the green revolution, the financial&#13;
system's structure was dictated primarily by the extension of two major networks: BRI's&#13;
village units (Unit Desa), which were mandated to distribute subsidized credit for rice&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
production, and the KUD agriculture cooperatives, which provided technical training. As&#13;
from 1970, only non-bank financial institutions could be established in rural areas;&#13;
however, their maneuverability with respect to savings mobilization and loans on the&#13;
interbank market was severely limited, a factor which meant that they generally were&#13;
restricted to operating on a very small scale.&#13;
&#13;
The Government's aggressive intervention in the financial system beginning during the&#13;
late 1960s led to the predominance of the public sector in banking6. The Government's&#13;
involvement in every aspect of economic development reflected its response to the&#13;
economic crisis. Interventions were conducted to stabilize the macroeconomic situation&#13;
and then to revitalize growth, focusing in particular on the agricultural sector. The&#13;
central Government in Jakarta managed the entire state budget, and even regional&#13;
governments were rather limited in their capacity to intervene.&#13;
&#13;
During the early 1980s, a number of converging factors challenged Indonesia's&#13;
interventionist approach to development. To begin with, the country had to contend with&#13;
the drop in oil prices and with the global economic crisis, which precipitated a decline in&#13;
international aid flows. Furthermore, the economic environment had evolved&#13;
substantially over a period of 15 years, and the objectives established for the first three&#13;
five-year plans had largely been met, particularly self-sufficiency in rice production,&#13;
which was achieved in 1984. Indonesia then had to define new priorities in the face of&#13;
increasingly urgent problems which threatened to undermine the country's stability over&#13;
the long term: on the domestic front, these were unemployment, the exodus from rural&#13;
areas, and the crisis affecting certain institutions, including BRI; on the international&#13;
front, Indonesia faced mounting foreign debt and oil was its major export in a market&#13;
characterized by plummeting oil prices.&#13;
&#13;
The Gradual Liberalization of the Financial System (1983-1996)&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia began to liberalize its financial system as part of its broader effort to liberalize&#13;
its economy, a step necessitated by the direction its economy had taken and&#13;
recommended by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Indonesia&#13;
charted its own course towards a more open economy (Vittas, 1992), and the&#13;
liberalization of the financial system in particular saw a gradual evolution of the&#13;
regulatory structure and an effort to strike a balance between liberalization and&#13;
economic stability.&#13;
&#13;
The evolution of laws and decrees7&#13;
&#13;
During the period of government intervention, regulations virtually froze the growth of&#13;
the private banking sector and created a market structure almost entirely controlled by&#13;
the State. The liberalization process passed through the following stages:&#13;
&#13;
    - June 1983: The first stage began with a 1983 decree which reduced the volume&#13;
        and number of institutions eligible for subsidized loans from the central bank, and&#13;
        raised ceilings on rates, loan volume, and the volume of most deposits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- October 1988 (Pakto): The market was not truly opened up to competition until&#13;
  1988, when the 1970 decree was superseded. The Government thus allowed&#13;
  established institutions more than five years (June 83 - October 88) to prepare&#13;
  themselves for the liberalization of the sector. In addition, new prudential&#13;
  regulations were introduced and a distinction was drawn between "general&#13;
  banks" and "people's credit banks", or BPR8. Banks in the first category, which&#13;
  operated like classical commercial banks, were the only ones authorized to&#13;
  accept sight deposits. Their minimum capital requirement was 10 billion rupiahs&#13;
  ($5 million). The BPRs, which were much smaller, could mobilize savings only in&#13;
  the form of time deposits or passbook accounts, and some of their activities were&#13;
  subject to restrictions (foreign exchange, insurance, and foreign ownership), as&#13;
  was their geographical scope (they were permitted to operate only at the&#13;
  subdistrict level, with each bank serving approximately 15 villages). However, the&#13;
  minimum capital required was only 50 million rupiahs ($25,000). Rural banks&#13;
  already in place were given two years to comply with the regulations introduced&#13;
  for the people's credit banks. The Pakto would profoundly transform the financial&#13;
  system.&#13;
&#13;
- March 1989 (Pakmar): In order to alleviate the difficulties which rural banks&#13;
  experienced in adapting to the new regulatory structure, the time limits&#13;
  established in the Pakto were eliminated.&#13;
&#13;
- January 1990 (Pakjan): The central bank's subsidized credits still targeted four&#13;
  priority sectors (primarily food production and small farmers). However, under the&#13;
  KUK program (Kredit Usaha Kecil, credit for small businesses), all national&#13;
  banks, whether state-owned or private, were required to earmark 20 percent of&#13;
  their portfolios for small credit9; similarly, state-owned enterprises were required&#13;
  to allocate 5 percent of their annual profits to the KUK program.&#13;
&#13;
-  March 1992: all these changes were summarized and expanded upon in the&#13;
  1992 Banking Act, which synthesized the regulations introduced since the&#13;
  liberalization process had begun in 1983. Its provisions may be summarized as&#13;
  follows:&#13;
&#13;
      Ceilings on loan rates and amounts were eliminated; Savings&#13;
      mobilization and financial intermediation were emphasized (through&#13;
      incentives for savings mobilization and deposit protection); State banks&#13;
      were placed on an equal footing with the private sector (they were&#13;
      permitted to issue shares and the Government's responsibility was&#13;
      limited to the amount of subscribed capital, although this was not borne&#13;
      out in practice); International prudential regulations based on the CAMEL&#13;
      rating system were introduced, the central bank was required to conduct&#13;
      routine monitoring and supervision operations, and penalties were&#13;
      introduced; The Government was empowered to call on all the banks&#13;
      (not only state institutions) to become involved in development&#13;
      programs; The distinction between the "general banks" and the "people's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
          credit banks" (BPR) was confirmed. Reversing the action taken pursuant&#13;
          to the 1989 decree, the Banking Act again set a five-year time limit for&#13;
          financial institutions to adjust to the new regulatory framework. This&#13;
          applied essentially to rural banks established between 1967 and 1970,&#13;
          which, despite the fact that they were described as "banks," had&#13;
          continued to be classified as non-bank financial institutions. However,&#13;
          any new institution which had joined the financial system since 1988 was&#13;
          required from the outset to comply with regulations governing banks.&#13;
          The Act explicitly stipulated what status banks were permitted to adopt:&#13;
          the "general" banks could be set up as limited liability companies owned&#13;
          by the central or provincial governments or by private entities, or as&#13;
          cooperatives. People's banks could be established as limited liability&#13;
          companies owned by the provincial governments or private entities; they&#13;
          could take the form of cooperatives, or they could adopt some other&#13;
          status established by government regulation.&#13;
&#13;
The impact of financial liberalization on institutional growth&#13;
&#13;
The liberalization process as summarized in the Banking Act resulted in simpler&#13;
financial market operating procedures, since there were only two categories of banks,&#13;
the classical commercial banks and the "people's banks" (BPR) serving the rural&#13;
population.10 The procedure for securing operating licenses was clarified. The rules&#13;
allowed some flexibility, given the adjustment periods envisaged and the options offered&#13;
with respect to institutional status. The liberalization process therefore led to the&#13;
"deepening" of the financial system, as the figures below clearly demonstrate.&#13;

(1)In the case of rural banks, the number of banks equals the number of branches.&#13;
(2)The "village banks" are village banks and granaries (BKDs); the "other banks" comprise the older BPRs&#13;
established before 1970 which obtained bank status in 1983 (BKPD and Bank Pasar); these were joined&#13;
in 1993 by new BPRs (930) and non-bank institutions which had achieved institutional status (273).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In terms of the development of the number of banks, there were essentially two&#13;
categories: on the one hand, private commercial banks and, on the other hand, "other&#13;
rural banks," the number of which increased almost four-fold. These new rural banks&#13;
were the 273 non-bank provincial government institutions which had obtained&#13;
institutional status and 930 new BPRs, which were 95 percent privately owned. The new&#13;
BPRs were established primarily on Java and Bali and in urban perimeters (see the&#13;
second part of this study for a discussion of their operations). The number of banks in&#13;
the national and provincial state network remained stable; none closed, no new ones&#13;
were established and none were privatized; only the agency network expanded.&#13;
&#13;
The year 1993 brought further progress towards greater liberalization, as rules which&#13;
had been considered too strict were amended. Bank credit expansion was encouraged&#13;
by the relaxation of some prudential regulations and the elimination of certain limits&#13;
imposed on the KUK program. The geographical restrictions on BPRs were removed,&#13;
which subsequently enabled them to expand beyond the subdistrict level (May 1993&#13;
decree).&#13;
&#13;
The current diversity of Indonesia's rural financial system evolved over a long time and&#13;
is a product of sustained government intervention, both direct (through the influence of&#13;
state institutions) and indirect (through the gradual establishment of a regulatory&#13;
framework). Involvement by the Government initially was justified in order to achieve&#13;
macroeconomic stability and to enable it to lead the country out of the crisis of the late&#13;
1960s. The Government subsequently invested directly in the development of the&#13;
financial sector: it established innovative institutions such as the BRI village units; it&#13;
made it possible to establish at least a small measure of equality among the different&#13;
islands; and it compensated for the lack of complementary markets such as an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
insurance market. Lastly, the Government gradually established a regulatory framework&#13;
applicable to all financial institutions, from the very smallest to the largest.&#13;
&#13;
The liberalization of Indonesia's financial system may be considered to have changed&#13;
the rules of the game (Vittas, 1992), since financial institutions enjoyed the utmost&#13;
flexibility with respect to their operations at the same time that they were subject to&#13;
increased surveillance. The liberalization process reflected the capacity of the financial&#13;
authorities to react to the evolution of the financial system and constraints on its&#13;
development, as well as their desire to adapt to changes and signals in the economic&#13;
environment. A balance was needed in order to ensure a more stable and efficient&#13;
system. The Government continued to play a major role as both direct and indirect&#13;
actor, and even retained the right to require banks to participate in certain development&#13;
programs (such as KUK). At this point, the "Indonesian model" seems remarkable for&#13;
the flexibility with which regulations were introduced over a 10-year period of reflection&#13;
(1983-1992), during which reforms were gradually introduced, realigned, and finally&#13;
synthesized in the Banking Act.&#13;
&#13;
This study will now explore the strategies implemented by the various types of&#13;
institutions, the information-gathering mechanisms and incentives they employed during&#13;
the screening, monitoring, and enforcement process, and the results they achieved in&#13;
terms of economic and financial efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
THE EFFICIENCY AND DYNAMIC CHARACTER OF THE RURAL&#13;
FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND THE ROLE OF THE STATE IN WEST JAVA&#13;
&#13;
This chapter will analyze the financial system in West Java by looking at four types of&#13;
institutions notable for their flexibility and effectiveness. A distinction will be drawn&#13;
between the older institutions which were established prior to liberalization and new&#13;
institutions which came into being as a result of the liberalization process. Lastly,&#13;
consideration will be given to relations between institutions and to the Government's&#13;
role in regulating the financial system.&#13;
&#13;
How Older Institutions Adapted&#13;
&#13;
The older institutions were those established before or during the period of government&#13;
intervention, i.e., those created up until the early 1980s. These were entirely or partly&#13;
state-owned and generally received government support, or at least benefited from a&#13;
flexible regulatory and legal structure which enabled them to grow. However, these&#13;
institutions did have to adapt to the changing environment once the liberalization&#13;
process began.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
        Resistance to change on the part of non-bank financial institutions&#13;
&#13;
               The performance and contrasting characteristics of non-&#13;
               bank financial institutions&#13;
&#13;
Non-bank financial institutions are government-owned in whole or in part. Among the&#13;
state-owned institutions, those owned by provincial governments were established after&#13;
1970, when bank status no longer could be obtained; in West Java, these institutions&#13;
included the LPK (Lembaga Perkreditan Kecamatan, a subdistrict-level credit&#13;
institution). Partly government-owned institutions included the long-standing village&#13;
banks and granaries (BKDs) and the village cooperatives (KUDs) established during the&#13;
green revolution. Non-bank financial institutions assumed various forms and followed&#13;
divergent paths within the rural financial system; however, despite these differences,&#13;
they all appeared to be rather lethargic and they did not adapt well to the rural financial&#13;
system reforms. They were, in effect, micro-institutions which provided small loans.&#13;
There were many of them, particularly in the KUD and BKD categories, but they were&#13;
scattered, and coordination problems prevented them from working in a collaborative&#13;
fashion. Their operating procedures were rather vague, as indicated by a provincial&#13;
government statement that "wages and management systems are to be set according to&#13;
the capacity of each LPK". The system undoubtedly resulted in a vicious circle of low&#13;
salaries, lack of motivation and poor institutional performance. These organizations also&#13;
were lacking in professionalism. Most employees had received no training in bank&#13;
operations and were simply selected from among village populations to staff the BKDs.&#13;
The KUDs had a "captive" market for savings accounts11, which put a damper on&#13;
employee involvement and motivation. The major difficulty for the BKDs was that they&#13;
were open only once a week, which restricted their clients' access to financial services&#13;
and reduced contact between the institutions and their clientele.&#13;
&#13;
The manner in which these micro-institutions functioned did not qualify as financial&#13;
intermediation. They collected very little in the way of savings and extended very few&#13;
loans. The relative absence of monitoring by their owners and their staffs' lack of&#13;
motivation and competence generally relegated them to a very secondary role within the&#13;
rural financial system. This in turn resulted in a very poor record in terms of labor&#13;
productivity, capital leverage, diversity and flexibility of services, and credibility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Mechanisms introduced to overcome the constraints of&#13;
               the financial market&#13;
&#13;
Against this background, a number of innovations recently were introduced to revitalize&#13;
these institutions.&#13;
&#13;
The principal remedy introduced in response to the risk of loan default generally was to&#13;
make village authorities share responsibility for compliance with the terms of loan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
contracts. For example, LPKs require that 10 percent of loan amounts be pledged in the&#13;
form of compulsory savings, and this requirement is backed by a written&#13;
recommendation from the village chief (Pak Lurah) and a photocopy of the borrower's&#13;
identity card is required. Because village political organizations were highly structured&#13;
as a result of government intervention since independence, village chiefs, at least on&#13;
Java, often are respected authorities.&#13;
&#13;
Some institutions were aware of their overall inefficiency and have attempted to&#13;
reorganize themselves. A number of LPKs, worried about their excessive reliance on&#13;
state financing, have introduced a locked "piggy bank" (Kotak Tabungan) which is&#13;
placed in the houses of the borrowers, into which they can deposit excess cash at any&#13;
time. Each week an employee collects the accumulated savings. This savings&#13;
mobilization effort initially targeted only borrower members and the amounts collected&#13;
were likely to be earmarked specifically for loan repayments. Even so, such initiatives&#13;
enabled LPKs in Bogor to double their disposable savings.&#13;
&#13;
The Government also issued regulations to revitalize the cooperatives and provincial&#13;
government institutions. The KUDs were granted autonomy (KUD Mandiri) so that -&#13;
provided they met 90 percent of the requirements - it would be easier for them to borrow&#13;
from banks and mobilize household savings. The requirements for autonomous status&#13;
were related, inter alia, to financial statements and compliance with program monitoring&#13;
rules. However, these requirements were not very selective and did not require any&#13;
substantial change in operations on the part of cooperatives in order for them to obtain&#13;
autonomous status. In particular, they were not asked to do much to improve service to&#13;
clients, which was a weak point of the cooperatives. Their "autonomy" thus was likely to&#13;
be rather limited.&#13;
&#13;
These efforts notwithstanding, it is surprising to note that the West Java institutions&#13;
studied here appeared to have been bypassed by the transformation process of the&#13;
rural financial system. The long history and stability of BKDs, the lack of interest in LPKs&#13;
- and, by contrast, the systematic support provided to KUDs - help to explain these&#13;
institutions' lack of vitality and their isolation in the midst of the transformation. Without&#13;
withdrawing or trying to modernize these institutions, the Government remained directly&#13;
involved in activities of limited scope and continued to provide operating and guarantee&#13;
funds. These institutions apparently played a political role which justified their&#13;
perpetuation in the eyes of the Government: village cooperatives were instrumental in&#13;
organizing, structuring and monitoring the rural world. Institutions such as LPKs or&#13;
BKDs, coming as they did under the umbrella of the provincial governments or village&#13;
authorities, gave those governments and authorities a certain degree of freedom to&#13;
direct the growth of the local economy.&#13;
&#13;
However, the State did not systematically adopt this approach, since some older&#13;
government institutions experienced profound changes in recent years which have&#13;
enabled them to face the future with greater confidence. This is true for KURKs (Kredit&#13;
Usaha Rakyat Kecil, credit for activities of the poor) as described in Box 1, as well as for&#13;
BRI, which will be dealt with in the next part of this study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                  Box 1. The Institutionalization of the KURKs in East Java&#13;
&#13;
    The institutionalization of provincial government entities proceeded in accordance with&#13;
    the 1988 decree (Pakto) and the 1992 Banking Act. The movement had begun in East&#13;
    Java in 1993. The institutionalization of East Java's KURKs was based on a regional&#13;
    regulation developed by the provincial government and East Java's regional development&#13;
    bank (BPD Bank Jatim) adapting features of the Pakto and the Banking Act to the&#13;
    specific circumstances of East Java and its KURKs. In particular, of the three legal&#13;
    entities whose status rural banks were authorized by the Banking Act to adopt - namely,&#13;
    regional enterprise, cooperative or limited liability company - the KURKs, which&#13;
    belonged to the provincial government, were urged to become regional enterprises.&#13;
    Capital subscriptions were available to the provincial government (approximately 50&#13;
    percent), the district government (approximately 40 percent), and Bank Jatim (10&#13;
    percent). This arrangement was intended to: (1) enable Bank Jatim to supervise the&#13;
    KURKs and receive a counterpart payment in the form of dividends; (2) ease credit and&#13;
    funds transfer procedures; and (3) in terms of development costs in particular, facilitate&#13;
    the diversification of KURK products along the lines of those offered by Bank Jatim. The&#13;
    transformation of the KURKs12 into institutions with the status of regional enterprises did&#13;
    not fundamentally alter their operations; rather, the central bank was able to monitor those&#13;
    operations more closely and the new status offered increased avenues for growth (such as&#13;
    savings mobilization and larger loans from other banking institutions).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        The shift from administrative functions to commercial functions by&#13;
        state banking institutions: BRI, a noteworthy example&#13;
&#13;
BRI is one of five state commercial banks (see Table 1). A national bank, it meets the&#13;
criteria for "general bank"13 set out in the Banking Act and primarily serves rural&#13;
communities, mainly through its network of village units. This network (BRI Unit Desa -&#13;
UD) has been widely praised recently for its success in terms of the size of its clientele,&#13;
the volume of loans disbursed, and the amount of savings mobilized (Robinson, 1992;&#13;
Yaron, Benjamin, 1997). In the early 1980s, however, the future of these village units&#13;
was in doubt owing to the serious difficulties they faced. This study will now examine&#13;
how BRI transformed itself as the liberalization of the financial system progressed and&#13;
what the determining factors were in its success.&#13;
&#13;
                Changes made by village units in order to recover from&#13;
                the economic crisis&#13;
&#13;
During the green revolution, BRI was a government development agency. It managed a&#13;
policy to promote technical innovations in order to make Indonesia self-sufficient in rice&#13;
production. Subsidies, support and targeted credit were justified by the economic&#13;
situation and the policy objective. However, the crisis of the 1980s imposed a strategy&#13;
change. BRI's village units experienced an alarming decline in loan repayments, interest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
in the technical assistance components which they financed dwindled, and loans tended&#13;
to be disbursed to wealthier farmers. Moreover, the village units had no financial&#13;
autonomy nor were they responsible for their own operations: they were merely the&#13;
village representatives of local banks (Cabang) and therefore lacked the means and&#13;
incentives to successfully encourage loan repayments (Patten, Rosengard, 1991). In&#13;
1984, BRI moved to transform the existing network byestablishing new objectives for it.&#13;
BRI's UDs operated a tremendous shift away from their past practices. In addition to&#13;
setting interest rates at a level which covered costs, BRI had to alter its methods of&#13;
operation and engineer a change in attitude on the part of its clientele. Many units were&#13;
closed down when their problems grew excessive, or they were transformed into&#13;
"secondary units"14 which were open one day a week to serve areas with limited&#13;
potentialities. Although BRI units underwent significant change in institutional terms&#13;
(internal structure, allocation of responsibilities, redefinition of services provided), the&#13;
system continued to benefit from the fact that it had a network of offices and employees&#13;
stretching across the entire country, a network that was particularly dense on Java.&#13;
&#13;
Those units which remained open were required to operate in the black and assume&#13;
responsibility for all financial intermediation services. Starting in 1984 each unit&#13;
established its own accounts, which were independent of the local bank (Cabang). They&#13;
had greater autonomy in managing loans, savings and their clientele.15 Local bank&#13;
approval was required only for loans above a certain amount. In this manner, units&#13;
which up to that point had served a purely administrative function went on to become&#13;
profit centers.&#13;
&#13;
Services were offered primarily under two programs: KUPEDES for credit, and&#13;
SIMPEDES for savings. These were simple programs which had very flexible&#13;
requirements and met a wide range of needs. In particular, they were open to all rural&#13;
activities, not just agricultural undertakings, and small loans were available (the&#13;
minimum loan was 25,000 rupiahs, or $12; some went as high as 500,000 to 1 million&#13;
rupiahs, or $250 to $500).&#13;
&#13;
Commercial strategies accompanying savings and credit services, such as incentive&#13;
mechanisms, gradually facilitated a shift in attitude and bridged the information gap&#13;
between lenders and clients. Prompt payment incentives (Insentif Pembayaran Tepat&#13;
Waktu) were offered giving clients a partial interest rebate when loan installments were&#13;
paid on time; good borrowers were encouraged to sponsor work colleagues to become&#13;
new clients; deposits were guaranteed by the Government; and savings lotteries were&#13;
held. Staff incentives were linked to employees' share of the unit's portfolio&#13;
performance, as well as to their level of training and responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
On balance, BRI's transformation was fueled primarily by the "privatization" of its&#13;
internal operations (decentralized decision-making, making employees responsible for&#13;
their work, a profit orientation, giving employees a stake in performance, and&#13;
incentives), the improved professionalism of its staff, increased flexibility, and the&#13;
targeting of its services to rural activities in general rather than to purely agricultural&#13;
undertakings. The gradual liberalization of Indonesia's financial system facilitated the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
transformation of BRI. Although rates were allowed to rise beginning in 1983 when the&#13;
institution's transformation began, the market was not opened to competition until 1988.&#13;
This allowed BRI (and other existing institutions) to prepare for the new competitive&#13;
environment. The Government served as a valuable catalyst in this transformation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                Current performance of BRI village units&#13;
&#13;
The fact that BRI village units began operating profitably was a major achievement of&#13;
the reorganization. The network's transformation was largely completed within only four&#13;
years (1984-1987), and the cost to the Government in terms of subsidies was relatively&#13;
low.16 By 1985, most of the units were turning a profit. In 1991 the unit network&#13;
accounted for 25 percent of BRI's deposits, 10 percent of outstanding loans and over 70&#13;
percent of its profits (Robinson, 1992). The factors contributing to this success were the&#13;
wide mobilization of savings with government guarantees, increased staff productivity&#13;
(the result of motivation and training), and the support which the village unit network&#13;
received from BRI's entire structure (whereby Cabang provided technical follow-up and&#13;
monitoring services and ensured a balance between profitable and unprofitable units).&#13;
In December 1996, the village units had 16.2 million depositors, 2.5 million borrowers,&#13;
and a surplus of $1,260,000 in savings over outstanding loans ($1,705,000). BRI's&#13;
outreach places it among the world's largest institutions offering services to rural&#13;
areas.17&#13;
A comparison of unit performance of BRI and KUD ­ two networks which were created&#13;
to support the green revolution ­ suggests that the Government has established two&#13;
very different entities. One is a commercial enterprise free of cumbersome operations&#13;
and constraints which might undermine its efficiency (although it is still vulnerable to the&#13;
pressures of corruption) and possessing the financial and human resources enabling it&#13;
to operate profitably. The other is a policy-oriented channel for government support for&#13;
specific agricultural development programs and a player in defining the structure of rural&#13;
areas. Older institutions thus were affected differently by the liberalization process. The&#13;
study will now examine its impact on new institutions seeking a place in the financial&#13;
landscape.&#13;
&#13;
The Development of New Types of Institutions Following liberalization&#13;
&#13;
The study will look first at the institutions established by the Government in the context&#13;
of poverty alleviation programs. It will then turn to the highly dynamic system introduced&#13;
by the private sector, which created a dense network of rural banks following the&#13;
liberalization effort.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        New institutional channels for government intervention: poverty&#13;
        alleviation programs&#13;
&#13;
The Government increasingly withdrew from playing a direct role in the operations of&#13;
Indonesia's financial sector. However, it continued to be an active participant in poverty&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
alleviation programs and established new institutional channels for intervention which&#13;
allowed it to retain the initiative at the same time that it increasingly brought other actors&#13;
onto the stage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               The state-sponsored system joins the informal sector&#13;
&#13;
The informal financial system had been denigrated for a long time as an operation that&#13;
was tolerated only because of the inadequacies of the formal system. However, not all&#13;
informal practices disappeared with the establishment of formal institutions, and the&#13;
advantages of the informal sector were in fact deemed worthy of interest. The informal&#13;
financial system relied on close ties between lenders and borrowers, a situation that&#13;
fostered more flexible and rapid service delivery without compromising contract&#13;
compliance over time. Transactions proceeded on the basis of largely perfect&#13;
information, requiring no special acquisition costs. The proximity of the two sides also&#13;
meant lower transaction and coordination costs. As the informal system regained its&#13;
respectability, formal institutions began turning to familiar community practices to renew&#13;
their organizational structure.&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry of Agriculture, either directly or through the Center for Agro-Socioeconomic&#13;
Research (CASER) under its supervision, launched projects patterned on the Grameen&#13;
Bank18 model. Groups based on joint liability guarantee arrangements relied on the&#13;
relationships among members to apply pressure to repay loans, since all loans were a&#13;
shared responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
The central bank, with the support of GTZ (the German technical cooperation agency),&#13;
worked alongside local village associations. These included rotating savings and credit&#13;
associations, farmers' groups, religious cooperatives, family planning centers, and&#13;
associations of microenterprise owners. In such instances, the projects built upon pre-&#13;
existing associations which were already providing savings and credit services.&#13;
&#13;
The new institutional innovations implemented by the state thus relied on the support of,&#13;
or were inspired by, established social and economic relationships, in particular,&#13;
traditional self-help groups.&#13;
&#13;
               The establishment of contractual relationships between&#13;
               institutions&#13;
&#13;
The Government also established links between development projects and financial&#13;
institutions, a step which enabled it to take advantage of the specific features and&#13;
capabilities of each partner.&#13;
&#13;
Project P4K was launched by the Education and Training Department of the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture, which did not have the capabilities of a financial institution. BRI therefore&#13;
was brought in to manage project loans (by assisting with implementation, helping those&#13;
involved to agree on proposed activities, disbursing funds, and collecting payments). In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
addition to disbursing loans, BRI became the depository for the compulsory savings of&#13;
members. Project P4K established a four-loan ceiling on the number of successive&#13;
loans a client could receive, the objective being to kick-start the client's operation so that&#13;
it would qualify later for one of BRI's standard loans. Staff at BRI and the ministry were&#13;
given the task of monitoring the project.&#13;
&#13;
What made the operations of the PHBK project developed by the central bank and GTZ&#13;
unique was the fact that links were established between banks, state and private&#13;
institutions in the formal sector, and village associations, including self-help groups and&#13;
volunteer cooperative networks (Kropp et al., 1989; Koch, 1993). There were three&#13;
scenarios for this institutional linkage. In the first model, a bank disbursed loans directly&#13;
to the group and received compulsory savings; an intermediary such as a&#13;
nongovernmental organization facilitated the transaction by providing training, advice&#13;
and assistance. In the second model, indirect links were forged between the bank and&#13;
the self-help group. Here, the third-party institution served as a financial intermediary by&#13;
receiving funds from the bank which it then disbursed to the group. Lastly, in the third&#13;
model, the linkage was direct, in that the bank itself made the loans and provided advice&#13;
and training. The project favored the third model, in order to encourage all the partners&#13;
to establish direct contacts and assume direct responsibility, and in order to cut interest&#13;
rates as far as possible by reducing the number of intermediaries involved.&#13;
&#13;
All these projects, government-sponsored or otherwise, were based largely on practices&#13;
which are now acknowledged to foster sound institutional operations, particularly with&#13;
respect to loan recovery: preliminary surveys to gather data, frequent meetings or work&#13;
sessions with local staff, social pressure, incentives, and the creation of client&#13;
expectations of future loans. Savings mobilization, however, continued to be a marginal&#13;
activity.&#13;
&#13;
As the Government withdrew from direct involvement, it delegated the tasks of&#13;
screening, disbursement, and monitoring to agents more qualified to conduct such&#13;
activities given their proximity to clients and their information networks. Nevertheless,&#13;
some programs remained heavily dependent on the State or on subsidies and risked&#13;
engaging in unfair competition with established financial institutions which were striving&#13;
to become independent and profitable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        The development of the private sector&#13;
&#13;
The number of private rural banks grew substantially following the liberalization of the&#13;
financial system, and particularly on the heels of the Pakto. This study will now examine&#13;
the reasons for this growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
               Characteristics of the new institutions&#13;
&#13;
The new rural banks took advantage of the opportunities created between 1970 and&#13;
1988 by sustained economic growth. These institutions, which were 95 percent privately&#13;
owned, were found primarily in the urban peripheries of Java and Bali. In geographical&#13;
terms they complemented the regional rural banks, but they competed directly with the&#13;
BRI village units, which enjoyed government support and benefited from years of&#13;
experience since the 1970s. Seeking to distinguish themselves, the new institutions&#13;
succeeded initially because they cultivated the image of quality service providers: their&#13;
offices were spacious and often new, their staffs were large, and their clients felt&#13;
welcome. Their strategy generally was to provide clients with a wide range of services.&#13;
They were unique by virtue of their business volume and interest rates, the incentives&#13;
and gifts they supplied, and their attentiveness to important household milestones, as&#13;
illustrated by the fact that they offered savings plans to finance pilgrimages to Mecca&#13;
and school loans for children. Emulating BRI to some extent, they screened their&#13;
clientele first by requiring borrowers to be able to present physical collateral such as&#13;
land titles, regular salaries or, more often, productive capital. The BPRs also counted on&#13;
a sufficiently large and professional staff to evaluate and monitor their clients' projects.&#13;
&#13;
Some of these banks adopted an approach distinctly tailored along the lines of Islamic&#13;
banking. In so doing, they adhered to the Islamic prohibition on fixed, preset interest&#13;
rates. The banks and their clients shared profits and losses. By adopting Islamic&#13;
principles, rural banks were quickly able to win over large numbers of clients and thus&#13;
mobilize substantial savings. In addition to BMI, Bank Muamalat Indonesia, based in&#13;
Jakarta and Java's provincial capitals, in 1994 there were some 40 rural Islamic banks&#13;
scattered throughout Indonesia's Muslim regions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Characteristics of the new rural bank networks&#13;
&#13;
The 1992 Banking Act limited the geographical reach of BPRs (restricting them to&#13;
subdistricts) and the rural banks which came into being with the liberalization of the&#13;
financial system frequently organized themselves into networks of banks dispersed over&#13;
a wide geographical area. The purpose of these spontaneous organizations was to&#13;
reduce risks that all the individual rural banks faced due to their limited geographical&#13;
diversification (inadequately diversified portfolios and exposure to local risks such as&#13;
droughts, epidemics, and declining prices in local markets).&#13;
&#13;
Nearly 60 percent of all new rural banks were organized into networks, and 70 percent&#13;
of the networks had at least five banks (BPR Bagian Pengawasan, July 1994). These&#13;
networks were varied in nature, and none had a status imposed or controlled by the&#13;
central bank. Some included a central organization which monitored and coordinated&#13;
the activities of the various BPRs; others were structured horizontally, with no umbrella&#13;
institution, and member banks organized their own funds transfers and training&#13;
programs. Some networks adopted an original approach, such as the network of rural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Islamic banks and regional networks financed and organized at the provincial level by&#13;
regional development banks (BPDs) and individuals living in these provinces. Some&#13;
rural banks were grouped into networks because they belonged to the same owner.&#13;
These might be Indonesian nationals owning several banks, or private national banks&#13;
which preferred to serve the rural market through rural bank networks instead of setting&#13;
up local branches. The network structure made it possible to optimize supervision and&#13;
monitoring efforts and achieve economies of scale with respect to training and technical&#13;
support services. General banks which created networks with BPRs were able to open&#13;
up a new market in rural areas and disburse KUK program loans pursuant to&#13;
government directives. The growth of this type of network occurred because risk was&#13;
limited, since the activities of the BPRs were independent of the operations of the&#13;
general banks and other BPRs. If problems arose, each BPR served as a "fuse" within&#13;
the rural bank/general bank network structure. The networks thus constituted a&#13;
spontaneous innovation which was widely developed, and the central bank adapted to&#13;
their presence, particularly by relaxing earlier geographical constraints (see the May&#13;
1993 decree).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               The performance of the new rural banks&#13;
&#13;
From the very outset, the structure of the new rural banks was impressive in terms of&#13;
staff size and premises. They were known for offering convenient services, some&#13;
institutions even having mobile loan officers to visit the clients. Their productivity&#13;
consequently remained relatively low in terms of business volume and numbers of&#13;
clients per employee.19 Nevertheless, the extremely rapid increase in business volume&#13;
with no increase in staff suggests that these banks can improve employee productivity&#13;
very quickly to a level matching that of their competitors, such as the BRI village units.&#13;
&#13;
A review of the rural banks' financial statements reveals that they have different liability&#13;
management strategies. While leverage is important to all the banks, their funds are&#13;
derived from different sources. For example, the Islamic banks, which focus on savings&#13;
mobilization, devote considerable effort to this activity, and a substantial share of the&#13;
savings they attract is deposited in long-term accounts. Some BPRs rely on long-term&#13;
debt through private banks, often as part of the KUK program (20 percent of the national&#13;
banks' portfolio is in the form of small loans disbursed through BPRs).&#13;
&#13;
However, the rural banks often adopt similar strategies with respect to assets, i.e., they&#13;
systematically disburse approximately 80 percent of their assets in the form of loans.&#13;
They are seeking to expand and to capture the financial market by offering credit. Their&#13;
balance sheets indicate that they have assumed considerable risk, given their low&#13;
liquidity ratios and reserves. Over the medium term, this may mean liquidity crises and&#13;
perhaps failure for some of these BPRs.&#13;
&#13;
The private sector thus has expanded very aggressively into rural markets and has&#13;
seized the opportunities presented by the financial liberalization reforms while&#13;
maintaining a highly innovative approach that has enabled it to adapt very flexibly to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
regulatory constraints. The constraints persist, owing either to the Government's&#13;
insistence on retaining excessive control or to the inflexibility of the administrative&#13;
machinery, which had to wait until 1993 for some of the rules that had been in place&#13;
since 1988 to be amended. Given this situation, the central bank has faced heavy&#13;
supervisory responsibilities, particularly since competition has spurred established&#13;
institutions to adopt reckless lending and savings mobilization policies.&#13;
&#13;
By opening up the financial sector, the Government of Indonesia performed two&#13;
functions justified by economic theory: first, by developing original mechanisms for state&#13;
intervention as a way to reduce poverty in rural areas it acted in the interests of a more&#13;
equitable distribution of resources; second, it created an environment hospitable to&#13;
competition and to more efficient institutional operations. However, the Government&#13;
appears to have exceeded its prerogatives in some respects (as illustrated by the&#13;
geographical restrictions imposed on BPRs) or to have intervened in a manner that was&#13;
not economically sound (subsidy programs and deposit guarantees on BRI savings for&#13;
example). Given the existing regulatory structure and the incentives offered by the&#13;
Government, some institutions took advantage of the more open market and devised&#13;
endogenous innovations to facilitate efficient operations.&#13;
&#13;
This study will now consider whether the Government has retained control of the&#13;
financial market and will examine how the rural financial institutions, taken as a system,&#13;
relate to one another.&#13;
&#13;
Regulation of the System and relationships among Institutions:&#13;
Towards a Contestable Market?&#13;
&#13;
The many types of financial institutions now in existence differ considerably with respect&#13;
to their operations, scale, size and efficiency. It would appear useful in this context to&#13;
introduce the concept of the "contestable market." In general terms, this concept&#13;
addresses circumstances pertaining to the efficiency of an industry's organization or the&#13;
manner in which freedom of entry into a market can enable the majority of established&#13;
businesses to operate efficiently (Baumol et al., 1988; Baumol and Lee, 1991).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                     Box 2 . Characteristics of a contestable market&#13;
&#13;
1. Definition&#13;
&#13;
By definition, a contestable market has no entry barriers, which means that there is&#13;
complete freedom of entry and absolutely no sunk costs are incurred.20 The advantage of&#13;
a contestable market is that ever-present concern regarding the arrival of new entrants&#13;
prompts established firms to adopt behaviors that are beneficial to their clientele.&#13;
Accordingly, even if an oligopoly or a monopoly exists, established firms cannot set&#13;
prices too high or reap excessive profits; new arrivals can always adopt "hit-and-run"&#13;
tactics and seize opportunities to make a profit and then exit once the environment turns&#13;
less hospitable. For the same reason, it is incumbent on firms to operate efficiently in&#13;
terms of resource allocation, management capacity, innovation, and know-how. Finally,&#13;
they are compelled to act in good faith. They cannot engage in unfair competition by&#13;
setting prices below costs ("predatory pricing"), because they can not make up for such&#13;
losses later with excessive profits. Discriminatory pricing ("cross-subsidies") also is&#13;
eliminated. Originally used to analyze the structure of industrial markets, the theory of&#13;
contestable markets helps in the context of this study to explain the efficiency of the rural&#13;
financial market.&#13;
&#13;
2. Application of the theory to Indonesia's rural financial system&#13;
&#13;
At state and private institutions alike, assets, outstanding debt, and collected savings are&#13;
scattered and, although liberalization reforms have been implemented, the Government&#13;
continues to play a major role. The system's structure is essentially similar to that of a&#13;
contestable market, in that it includes oligopolies as well as small institutions often new&#13;
to the market.&#13;
&#13;
a. Financial market entry and exit criteria&#13;
&#13;
Entry into and exit from the financial market are governed by precise rules which are&#13;
clearly set out in the Banking Act, and the central bank has already issued many licenses.&#13;
The procedures are therefore well-known. Although investments (offices and equipment)&#13;
are largely "recoverable," the characteristics of the banking business are such that loans&#13;
must be managed with the utmost efficiency in order not to jeopardize capital invested at&#13;
the outset. Nevertheless, through the Banking Act, the Government apparently has&#13;
established criteria allowing complete freedom of entry given the inevitable constraints of&#13;
the banking business.&#13;
&#13;
b. Economies of scale and scope&#13;
&#13;
A central tenet of the theory of contestable markets relates to economies of scale and&#13;
scope. Baumol and Lee (1991) note that "the role of economies of scale and scope is&#13;
crucial ­ without the availability of such economies, no one would seriously advocate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   promoting or perhaps even tolerating bigness." However, this assessment does not appear&#13;
   to take into account the fact that economies of scale and scope challenge the concept of&#13;
   the complete freedom of market entry, since firms practicing such economies that wish to&#13;
   enter a particular market must make substantial investments in order to reach an efficient&#13;
   size. It would therefore be useful to examine economies of scale and scope in detail, in&#13;
   order to understand the advantages of contestable structures in terms of efficiency of&#13;
   production, as well as the fairly substantial constraints on new firms.&#13;
&#13;
   The advantages and disadvantages with respect to the size and organization of rural&#13;
   financial institutions (RFIs) may be represented schematically as follows:&#13;
&#13;
                  Advantages and disadvantages of institutions according to size&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Advantages                      Disadvantages&#13;
&#13;
   Small institution         - Proximity, familiarity with        - Limited access to the&#13;
                             local conditions (lower ex ante      interbank market;&#13;
                             contract costs);&#13;
                                                                  - Risk management.&#13;
                             - Small structure (lower&#13;
                             management costs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Large institution         - Better protection against          - Cost of managing and&#13;
                             covariant risks;                     monitoring a&#13;
                                                                  geographically dispersed&#13;
                             - Flexible balance sheets;           network;&#13;
&#13;
                             - Impact of experience; "Too big     - "Decreasing return on&#13;
                             to fail".                            supervision".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Although entry into the financial market was completely blocked from 1970 to 1988, the&#13;
current structure of Indonesia's rural financial system is more characteristic of a&#13;
contestable market. Since 1988, the Government's role has been to protect state banks,&#13;
which, in addition to providing classical financial intermediation services, also serve the&#13;
general public throughout the country, even on the more remote islands (although they&#13;
are fewer in number there). They also provide the Government with a mechanism for&#13;
developing certain elements of its economic policy, as well as for financing innovations&#13;
such as the BRI network of village units. However, because the state system was likely&#13;
to prove inefficient, the Government pressed for arrangements which gave the private&#13;
and public sectors economic incentives to manage these institutions efficiently. Lastly,&#13;
the cost structure appears to allow small institutions to enter the market freely and to&#13;
compete with established institutions, whether public or private.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 22&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Some restrictions remained, however, concerning the pace and terms of the&#13;
liberalization effort. Between 1983 and 1988, the Government allowed state institutions&#13;
a delay during which they adapted to the transformation process; they were then in a&#13;
position to implement "retaliatory measures" to protect themselves against future&#13;
entrants by advertising their services to clients and winning them over through&#13;
incentives (e.g., lotteries, loan interest rebates). In addition, new entrants faced&#13;
restrictions on their activities, particularly regarding the geographical areas they were&#13;
allowed to serve. However, the 1993 regulations relaxed the constraints somewhat and&#13;
BPRs were now permitted to operate outside subdistricts. Finally, the support received&#13;
by certain state institutions could be construed as giving them an unfair advantage over&#13;
new entrants; the government guarantee on savings deposited with BRI village units&#13;
has enabled them to mobilize a substantial volume of savings which earn a lower&#13;
interest rate than that paid by competing institutions. This situation enables the village&#13;
unit network to earn a considerable profit.&#13;
&#13;
With regard to loans, lively competition21 compels new institutions to adopt a firm&#13;
offensive strategy which might take the form of an extremely high ratio of loans to&#13;
assets (approximately 80 percent at some BPRs), a situation requiring sound insurance&#13;
arrangements. Moreover, the number of institutions is growing rapidly and the central&#13;
bank now has heavy supervisory responsibilities both in terms of granting licenses and&#13;
in regular monitoring of banking activity.&#13;
&#13;
The financial deepening of the Indonesian system in turn has enabled institutions to find&#13;
ways to complement one another. These complementarities relate primarily to technical&#13;
support and funds transfers and, through recourse to loans on the interbank market,&#13;
they enhance the system's global image and no doubt sometimes help to alleviate&#13;
liquidity crises. However, it would appear that some market segments are not served -&#13;
small businesses still do not receive adequate financing from the financial sector - and&#13;
that the financial services provided are primarily small short-term household loans.&#13;
&#13;
The Government has steered the rural credit market on Java toward the structure of a&#13;
contestable market, although it has not necessarily done so elsewhere in Indonesia.&#13;
However, given the distinct advantage which deposit guarantees provide, state&#13;
institutions continue to benefit considerably from their savings mobilization efforts, from&#13;
which they are able to derive extremely high profits.&#13;
&#13;
THE CLIENTELE OF THE RURAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM&#13;
&#13;
Having reviewed the extensive development of the rural financial sector, this study will&#13;
now turn to the perceptions of clients, particularly rural households, and will consider the&#13;
impact which these perceptions may have on the institutions' future strategies. The data&#13;
for this discussion was gathered during field surveys in West Java.&#13;
&#13;
As is generally the case in Indonesia, the rural households of West Java are&#13;
characterized by their nuclear structure. Household economic activities generally are&#13;
very varied. Maurer (1986) speaks of the "occupational multiplicity" of Java's rural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               23&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
areas, combining agriculture (rice, soybeans, and cassava in particular), animal&#13;
husbandry, crops grown in village gardens, salaried labor, activities in the informal&#13;
microenterprise sector, crafts, trading and temporary migration for work abroad. This&#13;
diversity may be attributed to a strategy to reduce activity-specific risks as well as to the&#13;
fact that access to full-time salaried employment is limited (Dury, 1997).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Access of Households to Financial Services&#13;
&#13;
Household access to financial services is determined by geographical location and the&#13;
type of collateral households can provide. Household surveys indicate that in&#13;
Tasikmalaya, a region where traditional formal financing mechanisms are prevalent,&#13;
approximately 20 percent of the households have outstanding loans with official&#13;
institutions in the region; in Bogor the formal market serves slightly over 10 percent of&#13;
the households. Thus, despite the arrival of new institutions, they have made few&#13;
inroads in the market. As to the informal sector, 16 percent of Tasikmalaya's&#13;
households have outstanding loans with informal lenders; the corresponding figure for&#13;
Bogor is 38 percent. Field studies show that the informal sector continues to have a&#13;
strong presence, not only among the poorest members of the population, but also at all&#13;
levels of society, even among people who can gain access to formal services. The&#13;
informal financial services are described in Box 3.&#13;
&#13;
The differences between Tasikmalaya and Bogor, however, show that the higher-&#13;
income segments of the population in income-earning households and households&#13;
which own real estate assets are abandoning the informal financial system as formal&#13;
institutions gain ground. There would appear to be an adaptation period during which&#13;
the formal system and its clients get to know one another. Factors such as habit, mutual&#13;
understanding, and progressive introduction of clients to formal financial services play a&#13;
major role in shaping the impact that the sector has on households. The formal sector&#13;
therefore must develop a reputation for itself and win over local populations. To this&#13;
end, it must gather sufficient data on the nature of demand and the risks involved in&#13;
order to offer services which are flexible and which reflect the needs of its clients.&#13;
However, there is reason to believe that the approximately 15 percent of Tasikmalaya's&#13;
households which continue to deal with the informal sector represent an irreducible core&#13;
of clients for this sector, given the intricate social relations woven in villages among self-&#13;
help and mutually dependent groups, the inadequacy of insurance mechanisms, and&#13;
the rapid response and flexibility characteristic of the informal sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                        Box 3. Principal informal sources of financing&#13;
&#13;
   The following four sources are the most widespread:&#13;
&#13;
   a. Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs or Arisan in Indonesian):&#13;
   Indonesian ROSCAs primarily take the form of neighborhood groups of 10 to 40 people&#13;
   (mainly women) organized into cooperative groups (in which each participant receives&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
the amount contributed) or commercial ROSCAs (in which the ROSCA's organizer&#13;
collects a management fee). The amount of money involved usually is very small&#13;
(approximately 100,000 rupiahs or $50) and generally is used to purchase consumer&#13;
goods. The ROSCAs also play a key social role. For example, neighborhood women may&#13;
organize events in connection with religious ceremonies, such as the feast of Ramadan, at&#13;
ROSCA meetings. The ROSCAs also fulfill a consensus-building social function which&#13;
the State encourages in all areas of community life in order to promote the activities of&#13;
groups of individuals meeting in pursuit of economic, social, or religious objectives.&#13;
Accordingly, while the ROSCAs belong to the informal sector, they are fully recognized&#13;
by official institutions.&#13;
&#13;
b. Shopkeepers: Retailers, grocers, and owners of very small restaurants (warung) often&#13;
extend credit to their customers. Such credit is used to cover basic necessities or,&#13;
occasionally, durable goods, and interest rates may be steep (up to 20 percent monthly).&#13;
There are also itinerant vendors who sell clothing and dishes on credit. Finally, many&#13;
dealers in agricultural products buy the harvest ahead of time. This practice is called ijon,&#13;
from ijau, which means green. These "term contracts" exist for rice and highly perishable&#13;
fruits such as bananas.&#13;
&#13;
c. Pledged property (gadai in Indonesian): The gadai is an exchange between two&#13;
individuals whereby a sum of money is lent against a pledge of a productive asset (such&#13;
as land, a rice field, a fruit tree, or a vehicle). Dury et al. (1996) have extensively studied&#13;
gadai involving trees. The owner of the pledged asset relinquishes his right to use it to&#13;
the creditor for the duration of the loan. The creditor can then use the property as he sees&#13;
fit and harvest the crop, which serves as interest on the loan. Since no duration is&#13;
specified and harvests can vary, particularly in the case of fruit trees, interest can&#13;
fluctuate between 40 percent and 100 percent annually. The gadai is very flexible and&#13;
makes it possible to borrow relatively high amounts (between 100,000 and 500,000&#13;
rupiahs for a durian tree, or $50-$250, or several million rupiahs for a papaya plantation).&#13;
&#13;
d. Uncollateralized personal loans: Loans of this type between members of the same&#13;
family, neighbors, colleagues at work, or employers and employees are fairly common.&#13;
Although they are generally interest-free, social or traditional ties linking the households&#13;
concerned generally mean that it is more or less explicitly understood that work, gifts,&#13;
material aid or future support will be given in return. There are also "money keepers,"&#13;
trustworthy individuals who agree to safeguard cash for individuals, sometimes in&#13;
exchange for a small fee. Persons who make such deposits generally try to avoid being in&#13;
debt to persons who are close to them.&#13;
&#13;
The informal sector, which is traditional and of long standing, remains firmly anchored in&#13;
the practices of rural populations, the development of the formal sector notwithstanding.&#13;
These systems reflect diverse and at times interwoven elements: economic (shopkeepers,&#13;
gadai) social (ROSCAs, employer/employee relationships) or cultural such as religious&#13;
prohibitions against collecting interest (gadai). The informal sector is therefore much&#13;
more than a substitute to the formal financial sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       Segmentation of Financial Networks&#13;
&#13;
Market segmentation is dictated by the requirements of each institution as set out in&#13;
their credit policy.&#13;
&#13;
BRI and the BPRs extend loans against physical collateral (such as a certificate of title&#13;
to land, a house or a vehicle, or a pay slip). Accordingly, well-off families are BRI's&#13;
primary borrowers. The surveys conducted in Tasikmalaya indicate that the average&#13;
household utilizing BRI's services differs from the average sample household in that the&#13;
income of each member, the loan amount, and the value of productive assets are twice&#13;
as high. However, these results are widely scattered, indicating that BRI also serves&#13;
less- well-off households, but in fewer numbers. Because of the physical security&#13;
requirement, BRI and BPRs are the only formal institutions, along with government&#13;
employee cooperatives, which offer sizable loans (up to several million rupiahs). Only&#13;
the gadai system in the informal sector offers loans for more than 1 million rupiahs&#13;
($500). The ability to provide physical collateral is therefore a determining factor in&#13;
securing more substantial loans.&#13;
&#13;
Indonesian     Governments      have    promoted   the   cooperative   movement     since&#13;
independence. Many population groups have a registered cooperative. These take&#13;
many forms and often are organized first and foremost as social and self-help groups.&#13;
Government employee cooperatives require that members earn a regular salary;&#13;
microenterprise owners engaged in the same activity often organize cooperatives.&#13;
Social cooperatives, such as school cooperatives or those organized at mosques, are&#13;
semi-formal systems whose members' participation is based on their "social capital" and&#13;
the fact that they share the same values. Finally, village cooperatives (KUD) function as&#13;
quasi-compulsory intermediaries for the marketing of rice and many subsistence crops.&#13;
Loans are extended based on the borrower's social capital as well as his "political&#13;
capital," which is established through work performed in the cooperative's office or by&#13;
helping monitor its agricultural development programs.&#13;
&#13;
Programs to assist poorer populations include projects involving mutual benefit societies&#13;
along the lines of credit unions or "linkage" projects of the PHBK/GTZ variety which&#13;
require that a certain amount of savings be mobilized before a loan is extended. Future&#13;
borrowers therefore need to have some savings capacity. In the case of projects based&#13;
on joint liability, borrowers must be members of a group which in principle relies on&#13;
"social capital"and solidarity and makes members eligible to share responsibility for&#13;
repayment. The informal sector also takes considerable advantage of social capital and&#13;
family networks.&#13;
&#13;
Despite this institutional diversity, some members of the population are not served. First&#13;
among these are the poorest members of society, although this situation raises the&#13;
substantive question of whether credit markets can really be adapted to meet the needs&#13;
of the extremely poor. Another unserved group comprises "undesirable" individuals&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(yang tidak baik) or persons "of bad character" (karacter yang jelek), language which,&#13;
although rather vague, was actually used in the surveys of some BPRs or cooperatives.&#13;
The third excluded group comprises small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which&#13;
are larger than family businesses. The KUK programs (see the January 1990&#13;
regulations) were intended to generate support for SMEs, and KUK loan ceilings were&#13;
raised in 1993 to encourage this and take the focus off lending to the poor. However,&#13;
the major barrier derived from the risks incurred: financial institutions considered SMEs&#13;
overly risky investments (inadequate insurance protection, an inadequate legal&#13;
framework in the event of default, and activity-specific risk).&#13;
&#13;
In fact, an evaluation of institutional practices shows that the factors which determine&#13;
whether households enjoy access to credit are, first and foremost, whether they own&#13;
assets and have a regular income. Accordingly, landowners or government employees&#13;
enjoy privileged access to the financial system. Finally, for most institutions providing&#13;
convenient service, their clients' social capital and level of respectability are key&#13;
selection criteria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Household Strategies regarding Financial Services&#13;
&#13;
Households generally devise strategies to diversify their portfolios, particularly in order&#13;
to protect their savings.&#13;
&#13;
With respect to savings, only seven of the families surveyed in Bogor (18 percent of the&#13;
households) have deposit accounts in formal institutions. In Tasikmalaya, however, 22&#13;
families, or half the sample, have such accounts in formal institutions. BRI in particular&#13;
has been very successful in this region, and 20 percent of the families save with BRI for&#13;
a total of 22.8 percent of the volume of savings of the sample. As for informal savings&#13;
mechanisms, rich households use gold to diversify their holdings.22 The Bogor surveys&#13;
demonstrate the importance of informal intermediation, since one third of the&#13;
households make loans to family members, neighbors or friends totaling more than half&#13;
of the sample's total savings. Villagers make their own very short-term intermediation&#13;
arrangements which do not entail the direct payment of monetary interest.&#13;
&#13;
With respect to loans, while BRI is a major player (86 percent of loan volume), it has&#13;
very few borrowers (9 percent of the families in the sample). The strength of the&#13;
informal sector is evident in Bogor (56 percent of loan volume, 50 percent of the families&#13;
in the sample, and 80 percent of households that are borrowers); in Tasikmalaya, the&#13;
number of persons that borrow from the formal financial sector equals the number of&#13;
persons that borrow from the informal sector (18 percent of the sample in each case).&#13;
However, in contrast to the savings portfolio, there is very little diversification of loans,&#13;
and the situation in Bogor differs considerably from that in Tasikmalaya. Box 4&#13;
describes how loans are used.&#13;
&#13;
The formal system often is in direct competition with the informal market because&#13;
market niches tend to overlap. Formal financial institutions therefore face competition on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
two fronts: from formal institutions as a result of the liberalization process, and from the&#13;
informal savings and credit system. The different situations in Tasikmalaya and Bogor&#13;
reflect the public's attitude towards financial services as defined by how well formal&#13;
institutions know their clientele and the degree to which traditional family and village ties&#13;
prevail.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Box 4. How loans are used&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    As to their purpose, surveys23 show that loans, used for the most part for productive&#13;
    purposes, generally enable households to increase sales or conduct an ongoing activity on&#13;
    a more regular basis. These productive activities are primarily commercial activities: the&#13;
    sale of foods processed on-site (pastries, salted foods, fruit juices) and sold in a small&#13;
    shop (warung) or door-to-door (pikulan); the purchase of fabrics or clothing in Bogor or&#13;
    Jakarta and their resale, sometimes on credit, in the village. The second purpose for which&#13;
    loans are used is to finance agricultural activities (the purchase of seeds, fertilizer, small&#13;
    ruminants, or poultry). Finally, loans often are used to finance service activities, such as&#13;
    purchases of gasoline and small equipment by motor-taxi operators. Loans are frequently&#13;
    used to finance children's schooling, with women, who take a greater interest in their&#13;
    children's education, accounting for most of such borrowers. With second and third loans,&#13;
    the percentage used for productive activities tends to decline, although in absolute terms&#13;
    the share largely remains constant (reflecting the amount needed to sustain the activity);&#13;
    however, the share of such loans spent on consumer goods tends to rise and is used to&#13;
    improve housing conditions (building materials, electricity, radios, televisions) or to&#13;
    purchase gold in the form of jewelry (a form of liquid savings in the Indonesian context).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Household strategies vis-à-vis financial services are flexible, diverse, and, to some&#13;
extent, complex, which requires that formal institutions know their market well. That&#13;
being the case, the Government has thus played a major role by bearing the risks of&#13;
innovation, i.e., the investments needed to develop a stable clientele receptive to the&#13;
financial services offered by the formal sector. This is illustrated in the Tasikmalaya&#13;
region, where state financial institutions have been established since the late 1960s.&#13;
Because support was provided to the earliest rural banks operated by provincial&#13;
governments, households in the region are more receptive to the financial services&#13;
offered by the formal sector.&#13;
&#13;
CONCLUSION&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia's rural financial system offers a particularly interesting case study in the&#13;
context of current issues relating to rural financial mechanisms, in particular, with&#13;
respect to the role of the State and private institutions. This report has analyzed the&#13;
system's structure within the framework of imperfect markets and the liberalization&#13;
process.&#13;
&#13;
The Government has performed three major functions within the financial system:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  28&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
First and foremost, it established a regulatory framework for the financial system&#13;
through a series of decrees and the 1992 Banking Act. This framework proved flexible&#13;
and should be able to evolve over time as a function of the changing economic&#13;
environment and any limitations that may be introduced. This framework also clearly&#13;
sets out the procedures for market entry and the prudential regulations with which&#13;
general banks and BPRs must comply. Its specificity also derives from this clear&#13;
distinction between the two types of banks, which has provided a simple framework for&#13;
the establishment of nearly 1,000 rural banks since 1988.&#13;
&#13;
Second, the Government played an important role by virtue of its impact on its own&#13;
institutions. The sharp differences in performance by BRI and village cooperatives&#13;
demonstrates the importance of the State's catalytic role in generating reforms within&#13;
state institutions. The Government has the option to transform an institution such as BRI&#13;
by "privatizing" its operations (through decentralization and by increasing the&#13;
responsibilities of its staff, promoting the profit motive, and providing incentives). In the&#13;
same economic and regulatory environment, the State can choose to perpetuate the&#13;
status quo by continuing to provide financial assistance to programs whose employees&#13;
are not encouraged to develop a strong sense of responsibility or to become involved in&#13;
decision-making or client selection.&#13;
&#13;
Lastly, the Government can play a catalytic role. It supported the formal sector when it&#13;
was first being established, when households initially were hesitant to turn to the sector,&#13;
as illustrated by the different situations in Tasikmalaya and Bogor. The Government can&#13;
also finance the development of innovative financial services; one example was its&#13;
support for BRI's village unit network, which made it possible to introduce efficient&#13;
services adapted to the needs of the rural population throughout Indonesia. The State&#13;
also can promote partnerships between commercial banks, state institutions and largely&#13;
informal village associations and groups, as a component of poverty alleviation&#13;
programs. Although such programs generally are launched by the central bank,&#13;
ministries (cooperatives and agriculture), and state banks, their implementation is&#13;
largely the work of private partners who are more familiar with local conditions and the&#13;
clientele, and are often a part of social networks, a factor which bolsters contract&#13;
performance.&#13;
&#13;
Hugon (cited in Castel, 1995) describes the State's "pro" stance in Asian economies as&#13;
follows: promoter of private initiatives and of the rehabilitation of government&#13;
institutions; producer of services (such as within BRI) and poverty alleviation programs;&#13;
and prospector and programmer, as it delineates reforms and continually readjusts&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
However, the situation in Indonesia must be placed in its proper perspective. The&#13;
financial system developed within a context of considerable government stability which&#13;
left little room for political criticism. Moreover, the country's rural society, particularly in&#13;
West Java, is highly structured (groups play an important role, as do village leaders)&#13;
and its population is extremely dense. This has made it easier for financial institutions to&#13;
operate efficiently with lower travel, client monitoring and data collection costs. There&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               29&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
are still questions to be answered. Additional research would be useful in order to delve&#13;
further into the concept of economies of scale as they relate to financial services,&#13;
examine financing mechanisms for small and medium-sized enterprises, closely track&#13;
the evolution of the regulatory structure and the growth of the Indonesian financial&#13;
system, and analyze the requirements for the development of insurance mechanisms,&#13;
which are still virtually nonexistent. Lastly, it would be particularly useful to study how&#13;
rural financial institutions are responding to Indonesia's current economic crisis and to&#13;
examine the role of the Government during these difficult times.&#13;

     1These primarily have been "people's banks" operated by the West Java&#13;
     provincial government and BRI village units, which are heavily&#13;
     concentrated in rice-growing regions.&#13;
&#13;
     2In view of the pressures brought to bear on Indonesia's financial system&#13;
     (corruption, embezzlement, and lack of transparency) the reader is urged&#13;
     to view the figures provided with considerable caution.&#13;
&#13;
     3The historical analysis of the financial system has made it possible to&#13;
     establish a typology based on the private, public or semi-public nature of&#13;
     the institutions and on their geographical reach (local, provincial, or&#13;
     national). This typology was used to select the institutions surveyed in&#13;
     Bogor and Tasikmalaya.&#13;
&#13;
     4BPD, Bank Pembangunan Daerah, regional development bank.&#13;
&#13;
     5LPN in West Sumatra: BKK in Central Java, Bengkulu and South&#13;
     Kalimantan; KURK in East Java; LPD on Bali; LPK and BKPD in West&#13;
     Java; BUPK in Yogyakarta; LPK in Nusa Tenggara Barat (eastern&#13;
     islands); LKK in Aceh (North Sumatra).&#13;
&#13;
     6Although in terms of the number of institutions the public sector was&#13;
     represented by only seven national state banks and a number of rural&#13;
     banks, it was the largest sector in terms of its volume of business; in the&#13;
     early 1980s state banks accounted for 80 percent of total assets and&#13;
     disbursed 75 percent of loans granted. These institutions also received&#13;
     over 90 percent of the targeted and subsidized credits from the central&#13;
     bank; these refinancing operations thus provided them with their major&#13;
     source of funds (43.8 percent in 1983).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
8BPR (Bank Perkreditan Rakyat), people's credit banks.&#13;
&#13;
9"Small credit" meant amounts under 200 million rupiahs (USD 100,000)&#13;
for borrowers whose capital assets did not exceed 600 million rupiahs&#13;
(USD 300,000). These amounts represented significant sums in rural&#13;
areas and were to be used for SMEs rather than households.&#13;
&#13;
10The term Bank Perkreditan Rakyat, or people's credit bank, was&#13;
translated as "rural bank" in the English version of the Banking Act. This&#13;
designation as a rural service provider primarily reflects the fact that&#13;
these institutions were permitted to operate only at the subdistrict level.&#13;
In reality, however, new BPRs were found mainly on the outskirts of&#13;
urban areas.&#13;
&#13;
11Farmers who sold their crops through the KUDs were automatically&#13;
members. They therefore were obliged to provide funds in the form of&#13;
compulsory savings, which explains that each employee served so many&#13;
savers. In many villages, KUDs also served as channels for payments to&#13;
the national electricity company. Accordingly, most village inhabitants&#13;
also were members of the cooperative.&#13;
&#13;
12The provincial government of East Java owned 222 KURKs (Kredit&#13;
Usaha Rakyat Kecil, credit for activities of the poor).&#13;
&#13;
13See the definition of general banks in the description of Pakto on page&#13;
6.&#13;
&#13;
14Pos Pelayanan Desa: "village service post".&#13;
&#13;
15However, village units remained targets for corruption; some&#13;
employees were known to collect up to 10 percent of the total loan&#13;
amount before paying borrowers. The financial sector was no stranger to&#13;
this type of corruption which characterized the Indonesian economy.&#13;
&#13;
16The subsidies were used to cover losses incurred under the BIMAS&#13;
program, capitalize village units at the rate of 19 million rupiahs/unit, or a&#13;
total of $33 million, and establish training programs.&#13;
&#13;
17However, because the average loan was approximately US$1,000, or&#13;
114 percent of GDP, its services generally did not fall in the&#13;
"microcredit"category.&#13;
&#13;
18The P4K project (Pembinaan Peningkatan Pendapatan Petani dan&#13;
Nelayan Kecil, project to raise the income of small farmers and&#13;
fishermen); the KUM project (Karya Usaha Mandiri, project to generate&#13;
independent activities).&#13;
&#13;
19The data from the surveys conducted showed that from the beginning&#13;
the BPRs had 16 or 17 employees, each of whom served only 20 to 50&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
clients. The staff of the BRI units surveyed numbered 5 or 6 employees,&#13;
each of whom served 160 to 180 borrowers.&#13;
&#13;
20Sunk costs are investments which cannot be recovered upon leaving&#13;
the industry.&#13;
&#13;
21On Java and Bali; competition currently is less intense on the more&#13;
remote islands.&#13;
&#13;
22Gold-owning households in both Tasikmalaya and Bogor are wealthier&#13;
than the sample average and are in the high-income classes for 75&#13;
percent of the households. In addition, over half of them (56.2 percent)&#13;
have deposits in formal institutions (primarily BRI and cooperatives), and&#13;
the figure increases to 70 percent when all types of informal savings are&#13;
counted.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The study begins with the history of
            Indonesia's rural financial system; next, based on case
            studies in West Java, it evaluates the factors underlying
            the system's efficiency and dynamism and then turns to
            the role of the State; the third part analyzes the demand
            for financial services in rural areas.
