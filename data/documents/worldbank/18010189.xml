&amp;#12;THE WORLD BANK/IFC ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM&#13;
Memorialist's name:   Alexander Storrar&#13;
Date of Interview:    August 19, 1986&#13;
Place of Interview: Lodsworth, England&#13;
Interviewer's name:    Charles Ziegler&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:   Today is August 19, 1986.     My name is Charles Ziegler and I'm at&#13;
the home of Alexander Storrar, a former staff member of the World Bank.&#13;
Mr. Storrar had formerly served as head of the Agricultural Development&#13;
Service in East Africa and subsequently he served in numerous other&#13;
positions in the Bank, most notably as Director of the Resident Mission in&#13;
Dacca, Bangladesh, and as a senior adviser at Bank headquarters in&#13;
Washington.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Mr. Storrar, to start this interview, could you give a little personal&#13;
background on yourself and your career with the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STORRAR:   Yes, perhaps I could start this way.     In a sense my career&#13;
started quite a while back when I was Director of Settlement in Kenya,&#13;
because at that time we were operating a program of settlement there which&#13;
was partly financed by the World Bank. Because of this I came into contact&#13;
with a large number of Bank staff members.      Through this, really, and&#13;
visits to Washington, I suddenly found myself in a position where I was&#13;
offered a job with the World Bank by Mr. [Simon] Aldewereld, who was then a&#13;
Vice President of the World Bank and who, in fact, visited Kenya many&#13;
times.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I went to Washington to begin work for three months of an orientation&#13;
course at the World Bank.    It was certainly much needed, but was a rather&#13;
difficult time for me because I felt I didn't have enough time to do&#13;
everything that I should.   But after that I was posted to Kenya to assist&#13;
Dave [David L.] Gordon in setting up the Bank's Resident Mission in Nairobi&#13;
and to head the Agricultural Development Service [ADS], which had been&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                               -2-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
proposed and accepted by the Bank as a new type of operation.     I was in&#13;
Nairobi for four years as head of ADS, working throughout east, eastern and&#13;
central African territories in project preparation, project management and&#13;
so on.    Then I was transferred to Washington where I spent about five or&#13;
six years in the Agriculture Department of the Bank.     In those days it was&#13;
headed by Jim [Lionel J. C.] Evans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I was very fortunate in that I traveled widely throughout the world, in&#13;
Asia, Africa and Latin America, and indeed I believe I had a most&#13;
interesting time as a projects officer there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But when the Bank was being reorganized, I took it upon myself to ask&#13;
if I could be sent to Indonesia to join the Resident Mission there.        And,&#13;
guess who, the Chief of the Mission was in fact Dave Gordon, who was the&#13;
Chief of Mission in Nairobi when I first started at the Bank.     There I was&#13;
agricultural adviser both to the Resident Mission and to the Government of&#13;
Indonesia.   Which again was a rather interesting situation to be in, being&#13;
an adviser to the Minister and an adviser to the Bank itself.     However,&#13;
this appointment in many ways was at the time unique--although it is no&#13;
longer unique--in that we started to supervise projects directly from the&#13;
Resident Mission.    Prior to this, all the Bank's projects were supervised&#13;
out of Washington, so here was the first attempt at trying to supervise&#13;
from the field.     This, of course, led to certain problems between the&#13;
Washington staff and ourselves, not so much professionally but perhaps in&#13;
terms of communication and so on and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    After this I went back to Washington for a couple of years, working as&#13;
a projects officer in the East Asia and Pacific Department, I found having&#13;
to come back to a division a little bit more difficult, having been rather&#13;
a free agent myself.    But these things happen to all of us, it's a&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                             -3-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
problem that faces so many people who go overseas in the Bank.     Reentry can&#13;
be difficult.   No doubt that probably is just as much a problem today as it&#13;
was then.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Then for a short period I was actually appointed as Chief of Mission&#13;
for the Nigeria Resident Mission, but about three weeks before the&#13;
appointment was due it was cancelled.     And to my pleasure, really, not long&#13;
afterwards I was offered the appointment of Chief of Mission in Dacca,&#13;
Bangladesh where I spent another four years, indeed four and a half years,&#13;
very happily in that country, carrying through the policy that we had&#13;
started in Indonesia whereby supervision of most of the projects now were&#13;
handled by the Dacca office.   We went on further than that and included in&#13;
our efforts all the detailed work regarding disbursements.     Indeed, by the&#13;
time I left Bangladesh all the disbursement paper was produced in&#13;
Bangladesh and was sent to Washington only for payment.    I think this was a&#13;
particularly good move, and, by the way, nearly all the work was done by&#13;
Bangladeshi staff, supervised by regular professional staff, in Bangladesh.&#13;
It may be of interest to some people to realize that at least fifty percent&#13;
of the invoices are in Bengali, and therefore it was more likely that a&#13;
Bengali-speaking person could read them than could someone in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    After being there, again I faced the possible problem of reentry to&#13;
Washington, but this time with really happy results when I was appointed as&#13;
a senior adviser in the Bank in Washington.    There were five of us&#13;
appointed at that time.   For my last two years with the Bank I operated in&#13;
that position, dealing almost entirely with Africa.    At that time I visited&#13;
mostly all the African states, looking at problems, among others, of&#13;
technical assistance, which was still a problem.    I also dealt with the&#13;
more esoteric things, indeed, of the position of tsetse fly-borne disease&#13;
in Africa, which unfortunately is increasing rather than decreasing.     And&#13;
also the Bank-financed project on the control of onchocerciasis in western&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                               -4-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
Africa, which I noticed from my recent "World Bank News" is still being&#13;
financed by the Bank.     I only hope that they will be able to control this&#13;
in the future.    It is still open to question whether this will be possible.&#13;
Anyway, there in a rather long nutshell is the story of how I came to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:    What induced you to accept the assignment to the Agricultural&#13;
Development Service, and, as follow-on to that, why did you decide to come&#13;
to the Bank itself after having served in the Agricultural Development&#13;
Service?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STORRAR:    Well, as I mentioned earlier regarding the Agricultural&#13;
Development Service, I had connection with the Bank while I was Director of&#13;
Settlement and I was convinced, as many others were, that it would be of&#13;
great value if Africa could retain some of its more experienced&#13;
professional staff members, especially for the difficult years after&#13;
independence.    And of course, although I had these ideas myself, I was not&#13;
really the main moving factor in them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The people involved really were Barbara Ward--Baroness Lodsworth, the&#13;
Baroness of the village in which we sit--and Bruce McKenzie, who was the&#13;
Minister of Agriculture in Kenya--who was killed in an airplane accident&#13;
coming back from Uganda--and Sir Evelyn Baring, who was the Governor.        He&#13;
Chairman of CDC [Commonwealth Development Corporation] and eventually&#13;
became Lord Howick.     He died sometime back in a climbing accident.   So&#13;
these were the three people, really, who tried to put this thing together,&#13;
and perhaps even more importantly, were the people who had the good sense&#13;
to first consult the senior African politicians about the viability of such&#13;
an enterprise.    I'm quite sure that without having done this the thing&#13;
would not have happened at all.     They discussed it with people like Jimmy&#13;
Gichuru, who was then Minister of Finance, and Charles Njonjo, who is a&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                               -5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
very well-known personality in Kenya.       Their view was that, provided they&#13;
selected the right sort of people, that this would be a thing that should&#13;
be acceptable to the African people and would be advantageous for Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So as to why then I became head of ADS, I myself believed that there&#13;
was a need for such a thing and secondly, of course, I enjoyed working in&#13;
Africa.     I enjoyed working with the African people.    I spoke the language,&#13;
of course, of the eastern African territory and I felt it would be just a&#13;
natural continuation of my work, which previously was with the colonial&#13;
authorities.     And indeed if it had not been eventually for the abolition of&#13;
office, I would have continued happily in Africa in this colonial service&#13;
until my retirement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So there was no difficulty for me in accepting such an appointment,&#13;
because of my belief in this concept, but also because I had a number of&#13;
colleagues who also had the same sort of belief.      It was not all totally&#13;
altruistic.    After all, there were people who liked to work in Africa, and&#13;
it was proving to be, if I may put it this way, better paid than indeed the&#13;
colonial service.     So when you think about it, provided you've got the&#13;
right people, indeed you ended up with almost the best of both worlds,&#13;
which I think augured well for setting up a service such as ADS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:    Could you discuss the direct involvement of some of the more&#13;
outstanding personalities in the establishment of the Agricultural&#13;
Development Service?     For instance, Barbara Ward and George Woods who, of&#13;
course, was President of the Bank at the time, and Lord Howick.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STORRAR:    Sir Evelyn Baring, or Lord Howick as he became, was more our&#13;
guiding light.    He was Governor of the country and because of that he was&#13;
less active in what happened afterwards, although without his help, of&#13;
course, it would have been virtually impossible.&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                               -6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
    But the two people who were heavily involved were Barbara Ward and&#13;
Bruce McKenzie.     And they were a very interesting combination.     Bruce&#13;
McKenzie was a white South African who was a Minister in the Kenya&#13;
Government.     He was one of the best rugby players in Kenya, and indeed I&#13;
played rugby with him all the time he played.     We both the privilege, in&#13;
fact, of playing for Kenya against the South Africans.     That's rather a&#13;
long time ago, but I knew him as a farmer, I knew him when he came into&#13;
politics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    To the extent that one can be political in the colonial service, I&#13;
believed implicitly that if the Europeans were going to do anything at all&#13;
in and with the country that they would have to line up in some form or&#13;
another with the African people.     Otherwise the efforts were doomed.        Bruce&#13;
McKenzie became the first European to join the Kenyan African National&#13;
Union, and because of this in fact became rather disliked by quite a lot of&#13;
European people in the country.     But equally, of course, he was a man who&#13;
gained the confidence of the African people because of his outspoken&#13;
belief.     And this was really quite important in a way, important in terms&#13;
of the development of ADS, because he was the person who could speak to the&#13;
African people, trying to explain what it was going to be about and to put&#13;
it to them in such a way that they would find it acceptable.        In other&#13;
words, he was not a man who would hide things from them, say, you know,&#13;
this is jobs for the boys.     So the part he played was very much the&#13;
political part and in a way the common sense part of saying you've got&#13;
these people who know you, they speak the language.    Why don't you keep&#13;
them around?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Barbara Ward, of course, came in a totally different way.        She was a&#13;
very international person, and indeed I had taken her the length and&#13;
breadth of Africa a couple of years before ADS was established, showing her&#13;
what was going on in the way of agricultural development and the social&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                               -7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
problems, and indeed the political problems, associated with it.     But&#13;
beyond this, of course, she had two tremendous asssets:     she had enormous&#13;
imagination on a grand scale and, secondly, the tremendous ability to put&#13;
this on paper succinctly.     Indeed, she was the person who first wrote a&#13;
paper about the Agricultural Development Service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Now we go from there, really, to the Bank, because it was Bruce&#13;
McKenzie and Barbara Ward together who went to see George Woods to put&#13;
forward the proposal.     If you can find me two more persuasive people,&#13;
you'll go a long way.     Barbara Ward was a very feminine lady, a delightful&#13;
person; Bruce was a very bluff, strong South African man with very firm&#13;
beliefs and I couldn't believe that any President would possibly refuse&#13;
what they had proposed.     So perhaps what I'm really trying to say is that&#13;
these two people, both very strong personalities in different ways, were&#13;
absolute winners in trying to put forward a thing like this to a President&#13;
of the World Bank who, after all, was very far removed from this problem&#13;
that we were dealing with.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Let me just go back and say that this is not to suggest that Sir Evelyn&#13;
Baring did not play a part--he did--but it was a much more restrained part&#13;
because, obviously, of the position he held in the country.     And I think&#13;
perhaps lastly on this that Jimmy Gichuru, who indeed became Kenya's first&#13;
Governor of the World Bank, as he was then its Minister of Finance, himself&#13;
was aware of the setting up of ADS, because he was consulted.     But indeed&#13;
when it was set up he was a very, very strong supporter.     So, in a way, I&#13;
think one has to really bring in Jimmy Gichuru and Tom Mboya, who was&#13;
killed not long afterwards, as people who were really responsible for the&#13;
setting up of the Agricultural Development Service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:    Did you get any sense of George Woods' personal involvement in&#13;
the establishment of the Agricultural Development Service?&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                              -8-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STORRAR:   Yes.   As many people presumably will tell you, he was a very&#13;
approachable person, was George Woods, and a very pragmatic person.         I was&#13;
liaison officer between the Kenya Government and the World Bank before I&#13;
joined the Bank, and indeed in my visits to Washington, along with McKenzie&#13;
as a Minister, before ADS, one had contact with him and saw a very&#13;
practical person sitting there.    I think it would be only right and proper&#13;
to say that he was the sort of fellow, as I understood it--I didn't know&#13;
him well and I must make that clear--to whom you'd say, "Look, I think this&#13;
is a good idea, for God's sake let's do it, because if you ponder over it&#13;
too long, nothing will be done at all."    Without him, I have a feeling,&#13;
again, this probably would not have happened.    But what a tremendous&#13;
combination, and I still think that McKenzie and Barbara Ward and George&#13;
Woods were people obviously who had a lot of thoughts in very much the same&#13;
direction, although all three of them had completely different&#13;
responsibilities in the world:    one was a Minister in the Kenya Government,&#13;
one a writer really, and one the President of the Bank.       Interesting&#13;
thought, that, that people out of three totally different stables would&#13;
think the same.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:   Could you describe the relations among and between the&#13;
Agricultural Development Service, the Bank's Permanent Mission in Nairobi,&#13;
and the Bank's headquarters in Washington?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STORRAR:   Yes.   I think it's wiser you take them in two parts.     I would say&#13;
from the outset that the relationship between the ADS and the Permanent&#13;
Mission headed by Dave Gordon was close and good, mainly because of Dave&#13;
Gordon, because he â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ And I have left out something here.    Dave Gordon was&#13;
actually involved towards the end of actually setting up the Agricultural&#13;
Development Service and in fact he was the person who prepared detailed&#13;
papers on this in Washington for submission.    He believed in the&#13;
Agricultural Development Service and therefore from the very beginning he&#13;
was most supportive of it.&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                               -9-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
       Nonetheless, I think it would be only right to say we did create some&#13;
problems for him because there were also permanent staff members of the&#13;
Bank there, about four of them, and I think, like any new organization,&#13;
particularly getting support from the Chief of Mission, I think we got a&#13;
bit uppity and maybe we didn't consult as much as we might have done in the&#13;
very early years.     We had some very good people there, you know, like&#13;
[D.] Groenveld and Harold Young, who's still with the Bank--Groenveld is&#13;
gone--Andy [Thormod V.) Andersen, who also left the Bank quite a long time&#13;
ago.     But quite soon, through the efforts of Dave Gordon and ourselves as&#13;
well, we, inverted commas, "began to realize that they could help us."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       I'll give you the practical exposition of this.   We prepared our very&#13;
first project for possible Bank financing, we sent it to Washington, and we&#13;
got a very rude letter back saying what's all this about, this is not the&#13;
way you prepare a project at all.     And in my normal diplomatic manner I&#13;
said, "Well, for God's sake, why can't somebody tell us how we are to&#13;
prepare a project?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Quite rightly somebody responded, "Well look, there are people there,&#13;
Groenweld being one of them, who have been at the game a long time.     Why&#13;
don't you ask them?"     And the spinoff was tremendous, because we were able&#13;
to get advice from them in Bank methods of preparing and presenting&#13;
projects.    We wouldn't be prepared to admit that our way was any worse, but&#13;
it wasn't the way the Bank wanted them.     And so, gradually, because of&#13;
this, I think, and also the interest that they took in us, that soon the&#13;
two groups of people melded together very well and we ended up where we had&#13;
the regular staff helping us on ADS missions and ADS staff helping the&#13;
regular Bank staff.     For instance, Andy Andersen and I went up to Ethiopia&#13;
and I assisted him in the preparation of a project up there.     So eventually&#13;
we became almost interchangeable, except on management, of course, which&#13;
was purely a function of ADS.&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                             -10-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
    As far as relations with Washington were concerned, this becomes a&#13;
little more difficult.   I think it's probably fair to say that some&#13;
difference of opinion grew.   I would have to accept fifty-one percent of&#13;
the blame, I guess.   I think two things happened.   Firstly, we tended to go&#13;
it alone a little bit, which probably was a mistake, but on the other hand&#13;
we were answerable a priori to the Chief of Mission in Nairobi, and I&#13;
guess, as he was sympathetic, we probably took advantage of that.      I'm not&#13;
sure I was aware of that at the time but I think now that it probably was&#13;
the case.   We therefore, I think, tended to resent some rude comments, fair&#13;
comments no doubt, from Washington, D.C., but looking at it more in a sort&#13;
of antagonistic point of view, which I think I did and indeed in which&#13;
case, really, I was wrong.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But there was something underlying this which was quite real.      In the&#13;
middle of ADS we had 14 or 15 people there, all people who were not&#13;
particularly aware, as I say, of the way the Bank prepared projects and so&#13;
on, but people who really knew the country, who really knew the&#13;
agriculture, knew the people, knew the conditions and this sort of thing.&#13;
The comments from Washington, I'm sure in most cases quite justified,&#13;
tended to more esoteric, more economic, and this started to create some&#13;
strong difference of opinion between the Bank staff in Washington and ADS&#13;
staff in Nairobi.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I think up to a point maybe this is not a bad thing, but I think it got&#13;
to some extent out of hand and eventually culminated in a problem I still&#13;
in a way don't accept, though I feel I'm not being very generous.   We&#13;
prepared a project in Tanzania.   This was the first of many projects.     In&#13;
the four years I was there I think we sent 15 or 16 projects to the Bank.&#13;
When it came time for the Bank to appraise it the appraisal mission saw it&#13;
in a different light from the way we had prepared the project.    The problem&#13;
arose when the Minister of Agriculture in Tanzania, a fellow called Bryson,&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                                 -11-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
turned around and said that ADS people come down, prepare the project, and&#13;
Bank people come and appraise it and they say something different.          He&#13;
preferred what we said as opposed to what they said in Washington.          Well,&#13;
okay, number one, I think it was quite wrong of him to do that.        I&#13;
eventually went to see him personally and he did apologize to me for doing&#13;
something which I considered was very ungentlemanly in itself.        But&#13;
nonetheless it did create a problem, and the Bank became worried that we&#13;
would be representing the Bank's views when we prepared a project,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I think Jim Evans, who was Director of the Agriculture Department in&#13;
those days in Washington, felt very strongly about this.      He and I have&#13;
never really agreed on this point.      This is quite clear, and I'm sure if&#13;
you interview him he will tell you that here is a case where it did happen.&#13;
My argument was that there were 15 or 16 other cases where it didn't happen&#13;
and therefore one has got to look on the more positive side.      On the other&#13;
hand, I guess that at the end of the day Jim Evans would have had to bear&#13;
the brunt of any attack on us, so one could understand his point of view.&#13;
But I would remain all these years afterwards, twenty years after, still in&#13;
the belief that it is better to proceed and get things done and deal with&#13;
these odd things that happen as they happen and not alter the policy&#13;
because of an unusual incident.     And so that incident was unusual; the&#13;
others were better.     But overall, we got on reasonably well with&#13;
Washington.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:    I'd like to ask you how the Agricultural Development Service was&#13;
received by the Africans themselves and, to go a little further, once ADS&#13;
was established, what was the relationship between ADS on one hand and&#13;
Africans and African governments on the other.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STORRAR:    Yes.   Well, of necessity   I'll take this in several parts.     No&#13;
matter how much I would try to indicate that I'm objective, I suppose&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                               -12-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
there'll be some subjectivity in this, but I will try to approach this in&#13;
as objective a manner as possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       First of all, we had a situation in our assignment to these countries&#13;
that I believe was a very important factor underlying what I'm about to&#13;
say.    When we set up ADS, we refused nicely to sign contracts with the&#13;
governments.     And by the way, I still believe that to be correct.     What we&#13;
said was that we allocate Mr. Smith, say, for three years, but at any time,&#13;
if you feel he's not the right person, would you please send him back.        All&#13;
we ask is a month's notice, six week's notice, not for professional reasons&#13;
but purely human reasons so one can move his family and his kids and all&#13;
this sort of thing.     And I want to make this point again:   we made it&#13;
absolutely clear that they were totally returnable.     It was the whole idea&#13;
of ADS that these men would have a guaranteed future, that they could be&#13;
open and honest in what they were doing and would not be afraid of losing&#13;
their basic job in the meantime.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Equally, with the'Africans and the governments, we did not want them to&#13;
think, "Oh, my God, we've got ourselves locked into this, what are we going&#13;
to do?"     And especially with the World Bank, we were a source of finance&#13;
for these countries, so, well, they mustn't say too much because it may&#13;
interfere with the next loan, whatever it may be.     This was made abundantly&#13;
clear and I'm very proud to tell you that we never had anyone sent back all&#13;
the time we were there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       The only problems we ever had were twofold, one in Tanzania and one in&#13;
Malawi.     And in the Malawi case, Peter Nottidge was still with the Bank&#13;
project there when we had to remove him because he was to take over from me&#13;
when I left Nairobi.     Hastings Banda wrote a letter of complaint to&#13;
McNamara to say that this was disgraceful, taking this man away from the&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                               -13-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
country where he was so valuable.     And by the way, let me add that [Ronald]&#13;
Benham, who was also ADS, and who now lives in New Zealand, and who went&#13;
down at the same time to Malawi, stayed for 16 or 17 years in the country.&#13;
Each time there were new arrangements with the government, but he was there&#13;
actually for about 17 years.     And so the relationship we had was good,&#13;
mainly because we had good people, people who understood the local people's&#13;
habits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    With the characters that we came across in the various countries from&#13;
time to time, put it this way:     Jomo Kenyatta, I would imagine, was biased.&#13;
First of all, we were all ex-Kenya people to begin with.     Number two, he&#13;
knew most of us.     I'll give you a little story behind this, if you like.&#13;
Another person in the Government, by the way, who knew us very well was the&#13;
Minister of Settlement, Mr. Ngaini.     At the time that ADS was being set up,&#13;
I was the Director of Settlement and Mr. Ngaini was my Minister.      In the&#13;
Agricultural Development Service we had Victor Burke, who I think is just&#13;
about to retire, but Victor Burke was found to be acceptable and Mr. Victor&#13;
Burke was the gentleman who arrested Mr. Ngaini during the Emergency and&#13;
had him in fact brought into police custody.     And this says something, by&#13;
the way, for the African people, because when we talked to Ngaini about&#13;
this, he says, "Mr. Burke, but of course, fine chap."     He knew exactly who&#13;
he was.     And the African people, indeed Kenyatta, said these are bygones&#13;
and let's forget all about them.     It has got nothing to do with the future.&#13;
And I think that feeling was strong in the strange relationship of, really,&#13;
British people and the Africans.     Not all of them, mind you, on either&#13;
side, but it was quite clear there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The were only two other people we had close dealings with, really.         One&#13;
was Mr. [Julius] Nyerere of course, the President of Tanzania, who went to&#13;
the same university, Edinburgh, as I did, so we had a point of contact. He&#13;
was supportive.     He was a man who valued the people we had.   One in&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                                -14-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
particular I think, was Mike [Michael W. L.) Pease, who is still with the&#13;
Bank and was down there running the ranching project.       It was to somebody&#13;
like Mike Pease that he would have appealed to when there was a problem,&#13;
saying, "I've got a disagreement among the people here, please let me have&#13;
your advice."      This just says an enormous amount both for the staff and the&#13;
African leaders.     Kenyatta was a real strong, warmhearted sort of&#13;
personality, whereas Nyerere was a much more intellectual, retiring sort of&#13;
man, but he supported it, less so I think than Kenyatta, because he was&#13;
less direct and wasn't given to making strong statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Whereas Hastings Banda in Malawi, of course, was indeed very strong in&#13;
his views and he didn't give a jot whether people came from America,&#13;
Britain or Malawi or whatever.      If they were the right people to do the&#13;
job, he was for having them do it.     As a result ADS had on the Lilongwe&#13;
project there I should think the longest association with any one project,&#13;
one country, than anywhere else in Africa.       ADS was involved in that&#13;
project for 10 or 12 years, which I feel just says enough.       But, you know,&#13;
they want the people back again on this thing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So during the first four years after independence, when we really were&#13;
so short of African staff, clearly we were welcome, and indeed more welcome&#13;
than we'd be today when there are many more people coming up.       But at the&#13;
time, yes, pretty much appreciated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:    What were some of the major problems faced by the Agricultural&#13;
Development Service in its early years?       You referred at least partially to&#13;
some, but what were some of the problems that really stood out in your&#13;
mind?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STORRAR:    Yes.   Let me deal with it on two sides.   On the human side, on&#13;
the staff side, we really had amazingly few problems, because all the&#13;
people we had were all people who had lived, if you like, upcountry in&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                               -15-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
Kenya, started at the bottom, people that we had posted to quite out of the&#13;
way places, you know, 100 miles from the nearest hospital, that sort of&#13;
thing, were people who had been accustomed to it before.       And indeed this&#13;
was made clear to people who came into ADS that wherever they were needed&#13;
they would serve and we weren't particularly interested in appointments in&#13;
the main cities.     What we were looking for were people who would go out&#13;
into the field and do their job there.       We had limited problems, I think,&#13;
sometimes, with getting people settled down.       Post-independence, things&#13;
like housing and this sort of thing, was often quite difficult and setting&#13;
up education was also quite difficult from time to time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:    For the children?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STORRAR:    Yes.   But apart from that, not really any great problems.    But I&#13;
have to come back to a point I made earlier.       One of the reasons we didn't&#13;
was the let-out clause.     If the government really felt that they weren't&#13;
the people they wanted they must send them back, and we insisted on this.&#13;
I visited each project about every six months myself so that I could talk&#13;
to the people, both the government and the people on the project to find&#13;
out what was what.     It wasn't totally problem-free and I'll come back now&#13;
to an area which was a problem and in a sense I guess could remain a&#13;
problem.    When staff were appointed to these positions, they were appointed&#13;
to the government.    We continued to pay them directly into their bank, or&#13;
wherever they wanted it paid, but from the minute they stepped into Malawi,&#13;
or wherever it was, they became responsible to the government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I come back to Jim Evans, who believed that as these people were&#13;
associated with the World Bank, because they got them from the World Bank&#13;
office in Nairobi and were paid by the World Bank, therefore they're World&#13;
Bank employees.    So, what happens if anything goes wrong?     The person in&#13;
charge of the project says to do it one way, and the appraisal mission&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                               -16-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR)&#13;
comes out and says to do it another way.     In the end, the appraisal mission&#13;
was right.   That didn't matter.    The problem that arose here for the&#13;
government was to whom do you listen?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Now--and I'm repeating a little bit, which is probably just as&#13;
well--having fully noted the view of Jim Evans and some of the other&#13;
missions that came, I have to put the other point of view, which was:&#13;
Look, these people are working for the government and while they're there,&#13;
they are government employees, although we're paying them.     And they have&#13;
to realize this.   And that if they're putting up a proposal, they must not&#13;
think in terms of what the World Bank will think, they must think in terms&#13;
of what the government is thinking, they must put that point of view.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Now clearly there have been problems, but I can't call them very&#13;
serious except the one in Tanzania, a difference of opinion, between&#13;
headquarters and ADS.     But, okay, these things will occasionally arise, but&#13;
there can be no substitute for the immense value these people had in terms&#13;
of their practical experience and their knowledge of the country and so on.&#13;
And this far outweighed any of these other, I would almost like to call&#13;
bureaucratic, problems.    And I think maybe this affects my views on Africa&#13;
across development as a whole.     The more attention we pay to the realities&#13;
and the less we pay to the bureaucracy, the better it's going to be for&#13;
everyone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So I still remain of the view, having been on both sides and at least&#13;
having been on missions where I've been responsible, say in Dacca, for the&#13;
coordination of these things, that to me the Bank then and now would always&#13;
be wise to accept the occasional, if you like, difference of opinion of the&#13;
odd person put in this sort of position as a balance, that is going to be&#13;
better for development to be such.&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                               -17-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:     You have talked about people like Barbara Ward, George Woods and&#13;
Jomo Kenyatta.     Were there any other outstanding personalities that you'd&#13;
like to talk about, either colleagues in the Agricultural Development&#13;
Service or anybody else who comes to mind?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STORRAR:     Yes, I think I could; I'll just try to pick up at this stage.&#13;
Tom Mboya.     As you know, he was unfortunately killed while he was Minister&#13;
for Development in Kenya--that's not quite the right title but anyway,&#13;
that's what he was responsible for--and he was a man who represented, I&#13;
think, the forward-thinking African.     He had so many reasons on a broad&#13;
basis to dislike British people--! won't go into the detail, there were a&#13;
variety of reasons.     He himself was a great character.   And incidentally he&#13;
was a Luo, and I happened to speak the Luo dialect.      And this made us good&#13;
friends.     I'm wandering a bit, but I think the background is quite&#13;
interesting because his father-in-law was indeed a government servant, he&#13;
was a veterinary assistant, and a very capable man indeed whom I also knew&#13;
very well.     And so Tom, I think, in the background among his African&#13;
colleagues, and again with Bruce McKenzie, was the sort of person who was&#13;
strong enough to overcome at least the racial difficulties that were&#13;
looming very large in those days.     Tom was a friend of mine and his wife&#13;
Pamela I knew very well.     Tom, Bruce McKenzie and I often used to get&#13;
together and discuss the problems of Africa and its development.      You know,&#13;
this was before independence, which was nigh on treason, but African people&#13;
are not quick to forget people who at least are prepared to consider their&#13;
point of view.     So I think with this he was a man whom we have to thank for&#13;
his support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But then we come across from there to the ADS itself.      Yes, we had&#13;
several characters.    We had 16 people, I think, at one time and then we had&#13;
16 characters, that you can be sure of.      People were picked for their&#13;
character, really, for their ability to manage things, their ability to get&#13;
one with people, and despite all the problems, to come up with the goods at&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
the end of the day.     People like Dick [Richard) Henderson, who was my&#13;
deputy--Dick is now in Australia.     He spent four years in the ADS and&#13;
survived, that says something.     Prior to this, he was my deputy in&#13;
Settlement, he was one of my provincial agricultural officers in the&#13;
Department of Agriculture, and to put up with me all these years he must&#13;
have been quite a character.     He was a devoted and first class agricultural&#13;
officer and he had a terrific understanding of the African people and&#13;
absolutely marvelou~ with staff.     He was the man who did more to keep the&#13;
ADS staff happy than anyone else around in those days.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       We had people like Bennie Benham, who is now in New Zealand, who was a&#13;
soil conservation officer, and Bennie could be sent anywhere at any time&#13;
with his wife and the kids, they could up stakes and move in a matter of&#13;
days to the ends of the earth, and never complain.     He and Phillip Smith&#13;
worked down on the Kano Plains in Kenya and I went down with them,&#13;
introduced them to the provincial staff; within a week they each had a&#13;
house, built from local material.     They got busy and built an office, got&#13;
the business going and started the Kano Plains irrigation scheme.        It&#13;
turned out to be very successful.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       These sort of people were typical of the people we had.   Victor Burke,&#13;
who is just leaving the Bank now, even in the days of the Department of&#13;
Agriculture he was very much admired and respected and liked by the African&#13;
people, and wherever he went it was just the same.     Within months he was a&#13;
fellow who understood the people, the people got to love and he got in with&#13;
them in no uncertain terms.     He is happily married to a lady in the&#13;
American Peace Corps in Swaziland.     He's still over there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       This is just a vignette of the sort of enormously competent people we&#13;
had.     The youngest staff member was Dick [Richard G.] Grimshaw.   He's now a&#13;
division chief in Delhi, but he was one of the few people, by the way, who&#13;
came from the outside.     Again, a man of strong character, strong desire to&#13;
get things done.&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                               -19-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
    I'll tell you a little story about him, he's still with the Bank.         I&#13;
met him in Zambia, he was down there, and this in a way depicts the man.&#13;
I went out to see what he was doing in the area where he was working--he&#13;
was an agricultural officer--and I got taken around to the point of&#13;
exhaustion.    And when I said to him, you know, we've got this ADS thing and&#13;
I think your the sort of guy maybe who would be useful for us.        He never&#13;
asked what the salaries were or anything at all, he just said if that's&#13;
what I thought, he'd come.     And that's how we hired Dick Grimshaw.     Again,&#13;
strong personality, strong character, but with a sympathy to the African&#13;
people,     I say that for them all, they're all exactly the same.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:    Most of this interview, of course, concerns your experiences with&#13;
the Agricultural Development Service.        In view of that, would you like to&#13;
sum up, or do you have any concluding thoughts on your experiences with the&#13;
Agricultural Development Service?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STORRAR:    Yes.   I would welcome this opportunity.    The Bank also set up a&#13;
similar thing in West Africa, and this was set up completely different.&#13;
The ADS people in Kenya, or East Africa, they had contracts to the World&#13;
Bank.     In West Africa the Bank was actually underwriting their salaries.&#13;
But for some reason I don't really understand, they still were able to get&#13;
a laissez passer, although they were not really employees of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I want to broaden this a bit.     I was asked before I left the Bank to&#13;
look at a technical assistance problem in Sub-Saharan Africa where, by the&#13;
way, according to my estimates there are about 150,000 of them.       And I&#13;
asked many people about this.     I alos asked the Bank, bilateral donors and,&#13;
perhaps most important, the African governments, for their views on this.&#13;
The Bank and the bilaterals all felt that technical assistance was a good&#13;
thing and necessary; indeed at that particular time in the Bank's&#13;
commitment to Africa, if I remember correctly, as about $450 million a year&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                               -20-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
alone in technical assistance.     The people who worked there were from many&#13;
countries, including American, British and French. They were I think mainly&#13;
quite competent people and quite willing to do a job.       But I think they&#13;
were rather frustrated in many of the things they did.       The African people&#13;
had a slightly different view.     They said, well, you know, the trouble is&#13;
that you have a lot of unemployment, this was a good way of getting people&#13;
employed; these people come out here, they never learn to speak our&#13;
language, they don't really understand us, and they spend half the time&#13;
coming, the other half going, and really they make very little&#13;
contribution.     It came out clearly that their main objection was the fact&#13;
that the people really didn't associate themselves with the problems of the&#13;
country, with the people of the country, and therefore really they were of&#13;
very limited use.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So, I use that introduction to reflect on the Agricultural Development&#13;
Service.    Looking back it seems to me that it is quite important in&#13;
whatever walk of life we look at, that experience if possible should be&#13;
used and continuity should be assured.       The Africans are really the most&#13;
conservative of people, and to the point almost that they'd rather have&#13;
someone they knew, never mind his competence, and of course that could be a&#13;
critical error.     But they are this conservative.   For instance, in America&#13;
I would expect the opposite, people say, well, if he's a well-qualified guy&#13;
and he's good, let me have a go at him.       I'll wonder what to do with him if&#13;
he isn't any good.     But the Africans don't react like this.    So I look back&#13;
and think somehow we have failed.     I accept the fact that the Bank has to&#13;
be careful of having people out there who can be associated with the Bank&#13;
and therefore could cause the sort of problem I discussed in Tanzania.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I still don't believe that that is a major problem.       In the longer run,&#13;
it's not the political people we're dealing with.      Again, this was a&#13;
politician in Tanzania who brought it up, but with the ordinary people, the&#13;
staff members of the government departments and so on and so forth, I&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                                 -21-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
believe in the long run that we would have been better to have fostered&#13;
this direct association with the Bank and to accept the idea that we would&#13;
be prepared to face the odd criticism that surely would come as to be of&#13;
very little importance in relation to the benefit gained by keeping people&#13;
there who were practical and competent and above all were acceptable to the&#13;
African people.     Because this is where we always fail, we don't get through&#13;
to the African people, we don't get through to the way they're thinking.&#13;
And as a result, many things that really could have been achieved have not&#13;
been.   Obviously we can't have thousands and thousands of people in an&#13;
Agricultural Development Service run by the Bank, but may I say that in the&#13;
first three years that we ran the ADS we made it pay its way and it was&#13;
nofinancial burden to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    This leads me to believe, in retrospect, that independent countries in&#13;
Africa, thirty or forty of them, should have retained a number of the&#13;
experienced expatriates in an ADS-type setup who would have been the&#13;
kingpins of the major development projects, people who, and I can put it&#13;
this way, who the African government said yes, they would like them to&#13;
stay, not for any other reason than that they would have confidence in&#13;
them.   I think we missed that.    And I believe that they could have made a&#13;
tremendous contribution to many of the projects I'm afraid were not really&#13;
as successful as they should have been.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:    Mr. Storrar, you served for some time with the Resident Mission&#13;
in Indonesia.     Would you like to say anything about your experiences there?&#13;
I believe one of the more controversial aspects of Bank policy over the&#13;
years in Indonesia has been in the transmigration sector.      You might care&#13;
to comment something on that aspect of your work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STORRAR:    Yes, I'd be delighted to.    It is a controversial subject.   I am&#13;
not wholly convinced it should be, but it is.      I think it's just important&#13;
to quickly mention the background.      Java has a population of about&#13;

populated by Javanese and Sundanese people, who basically are not very keen&#13;
to move away from their ancestral areas, but where the pressure of the&#13;
population is quite intense.     Then of course you have the rest of the&#13;
country which is, you know, one might say virtually empty.     Kalimantan I&#13;
think is a country much bigger than France and has something like five&#13;
million people, and even Sumatra has amazingly few people in terms of the&#13;
huge country that it is.     So it seems clear that politically and socially&#13;
and economically that people must move out of Java and into the other&#13;
islands, that's for sure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Number two, there's got to be an understanding of the political reality&#13;
that there tends to be resistance from the local people in the receiving&#13;
areas, from the fact they're different peoples on the other islands, to the&#13;
Javanese and Sundanese people moving in.     These are very, very bland&#13;
statements but they're true and they're very important.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:    Is there much resistance on the part of the Javanese people to&#13;
move out?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STORRAR:    Oh, there is.   They really would prefer not to move, they have&#13;
very strong ties ancestrally there.    You know, while they are Moslem people&#13;
there is still a very strong Hindu influence lying at the back of all this&#13;
and they themselves prefer to be where they are, speaking their language,&#13;
Javanese and Sundanese, not Bahasa Indonesia.    Also, in the central&#13;
highlands, of course, of Java is one of the most lovely parts of the&#13;
country to live in.    But nonetheless, the migration has taken place and&#13;
will continue to take place.    Quickly in the past, as people have moved of&#13;
their own free will--spontaneous they were called, spontaneous&#13;
transfers--who moved mainly to Sumatra, where the results have really been&#13;
rather poor.    They've tended to be pushed into the poorer lands, or pushed&#13;
themselves into the poorer lands, whichever way you like to read this, they&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                              -23-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
were allowed to move into the poorer lands and really basically were not&#13;
very successful.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The Government, assisted by other institutions, including the Bank,&#13;
tried to find the solutions to this problem.     The Bank started off in&#13;
Sumatra, as it happens, not associated with transmigration but with a small&#13;
project up in the northwest, where people had I think it was about five&#13;
hectares of land, and we were involved in the planting of two hectares of&#13;
rubber to establish the holdings, underplanting them with rice and then&#13;
after three years handing them over to the local farmers to let them get on&#13;
with the business.    Because in the fourth or fifth year, anyway, the rubber&#13;
is coming into bearing and there's an income arising from that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I want to go a little bit on a very important part of all this:        the&#13;
Sumatran area in particular, and also Kalimantan, it's rain forest, and I&#13;
know it's a very popular subject today, there's a question of degradation,&#13;
but it's true there that it's very, very easy to degrade these areas.       And&#13;
in my view the idea of moving into what would be called arible agriculture&#13;
is almost heading for certain disaster.     You get marvelous crops for a year&#13;
or two, you know, then in these very acid soils with very, very poor&#13;
fertility the agriculture production collapses.     Indeed, FAO [United&#13;
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization] has done some very interesting&#13;
work on this in Indonesia.    It was suggested that we ought to go ahead with&#13;
transmigration, the idea of establishing with development funds maybe two&#13;
hectares of tree crops and then allow the farmer to develop the rest&#13;
himself.    He would obviously participate in the establishment of the&#13;
initial plantings, but the remainder of his is three or four hectares he&#13;
would establish himself.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And the Bank, in the days of Mr. [Robert S.] McNamara and Bernie&#13;
[Bernard R.] Bell, reached a position where they said that they couldn't&#13;
afford to spend something like $1100 or $1300 per family on transmigration,&#13;
and this of course immediately ruled out any question on the establishment&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                               -24-&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
of, say, rubber or oil palm, because that would have used up the whole&#13;
amount of money just for that alone.     So by this one single act this&#13;
immediately removed the possibility of doing what I was recommending.        And&#13;
the approach taken along this line--$1100 for development of each&#13;
holding--was bound to be a failure.     I presume it was because, if I&#13;
remember correctly, Bob [A. Robert] Sadove and a group of people were out&#13;
there to have a look and see what should be done.      Well, whoever was&#13;
responsible--and I don't really know, so I'm not trying to hide behind&#13;
anything--they eventually ended up talking about clearing the land with&#13;
Caterpillar tractors, chains and goodness knows what, which to me is just&#13;
the most horrendous thought in these tropical forest areas, and&#13;
particularly for settlement.     I understand, by the way, that that has now&#13;
gone to the wall.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    There are two things that must be for successful settlement, and by the&#13;
way this has become rather evident in Latin America where there's a lot of&#13;
transmigration.     Number one, the idea of organized settlement of people, in&#13;
other words the selection of people by local chiefs or by local&#13;
bureaucrats, virtually dooms the thing to failure.      A very good example of&#13;
this was in Colombia where the people were selected by a committee.&#13;
Everything was done for them.     Sixty percent of the settlers within two&#13;
years returned to where they came from.      Whereas spontaneous settlers go&#13;
down there and nothing is done for them at all, the return rate was only&#13;
four or five percent.    And this was in a sense like the settlement of the&#13;
United States.    The people who went there went for a particular reason,&#13;
they sure as hell weren't funded by the government, and because of their&#13;
beliefs and their action, what they did was successful.      I don't see why&#13;
300 years later why we should really think any different.      Because the one&#13;
thing that hasn't changed in many ways is the attitude of the human being&#13;
to this sort of thing.&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                                -25-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
     So the first mistake I think being made is the question of settler&#13;
selection.     If you see migration, transmigration, as providing a facility&#13;
for people who want to move, this will keep the development cost to a&#13;
minimum, number one.     Number two, I don't believe we should talk in terms&#13;
of a holding that would make it financially much superior to where they&#13;
came from because this would be, in my opinion, a misallocation of&#13;
resources, and we'd probably get people coming in for the wrong reasons.&#13;
You know, that maybe could have a small advantage or a middling advantage&#13;
over where they came from, fair enough, but not beyond that.      So I believe&#13;
that in the end transmigration will be successful where in these settlement&#13;
areas--and there they have to get permission from local people that it can&#13;
be&#13;
settled--they would provide roads, which are essential, provide guidance&#13;
and, in my opinion, in that particular environment provide a basic tree&#13;
crop that would meet subsistence requirements.      In other words, if that&#13;
would be enough to get them by, then if they wanted to improve their&#13;
position they would have to develop the remainder of the land, from their&#13;
own resources.     I'm not sure whether that is happening in Indonesia or not&#13;
but I hope it is.     And I repeat:   the first important thing is the fact&#13;
that the chosen settlers should be the ones who themselves chose to go.&#13;
And, number two, that for human and economic reasons some basic services&#13;
need to be provided, but no more than is absolutely essential to make the&#13;
thing eventually an economic and social success.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:     During your period in Indonesia would you say that the Bank's&#13;
projects in the transmigration sector were being conducted reasonably well?&#13;
Would you care to give any assessment on how the Bank itself was doing it?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STORRAR:     Well, to be fair to the Bank, at that time they were only&#13;
marginally involved in it.     Some of the projects were disastrous, I mean&#13;
they were going in the other direction, spending several hundreds of&#13;
dollars per settler's house on each little plantation, each little holding,&#13;
which is absolutely ridiculous.&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                              -26-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
    Now to be fair, in fact neither the Government or the Bank knew much&#13;
about transmigration.    And the Bank was called in to help.   It was clear&#13;
that at Lampung, in southern Sumatra, transmigration was a failure.     They&#13;
were on land that was completely unsuited for cultivation, and indeed the&#13;
people were starving.    Robert McNamara went to visit when he was out on an&#13;
Indonesia visit.    And the thing was there for everyone to see and of course&#13;
this became a political problem because the people were destitute     Then it&#13;
was a further problem, as people wanted to go back to Java again, which of&#13;
course didn't solve the problem, and it made the problem even worse than it&#13;
was before.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In an effort to do something quickly, mistakes were made.    I would be&#13;
very arrogant if I said that I knew the best solution for the settlement of&#13;
the tropical rain forests, but it seems to make sense to encourage the&#13;
spontaneous settler and support the planting of tree crops because, if you&#13;
take Brazil and the Amazon Basin where they've moved in with cultivation,&#13;
they really have degraded the environment, there's no question about it.&#13;
There are people who object to the idea of planting tree crops in rain&#13;
forest areas, but in fact it does very little harm, you're really putting&#13;
in productive forest for unproductive forest, and the best example you can&#13;
find of that is you go to Malaysia and see thousands of square miles of&#13;
rubber that has been planted by smallholders.    So I think that the idea of&#13;
tree crops associated with limited cultivation of rice, because the&#13;
smallholder has to have that, is about the best compromise you could make&#13;
at the moment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I believe it to be an immensely important thing to devleop a proper&#13;
policy for rain forest areas, because if you think of the whole of the&#13;
Amazon Basin, the whole of the Congo Basin, and large parts of Indonesia,&#13;
which are still virtually unsettled and are going to be settled over the&#13;
next decades.    In fact, there's a real large part of the tropical forest&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                                -27-&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR)&#13;
world which has not yet been settled and it is the last target, indeed, of&#13;
the human race, everywhere else has really been taken over except that.         So&#13;
I would advise the development of tree crops and I would advise them to&#13;
think hard about the solutions, which will never be perfect politically,&#13;
economically or socially, but there is a compromise which in the end should&#13;
result in the prevention of degradation.      Because if you try to exclude the&#13;
human race from the forest you will not succeed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:     Finally, Mr. Storrar, you at the end of your career at the Bank&#13;
were a senior adviser, I believe you were especially involved in Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa.     Would you care to elaborate on some of your experiences in&#13;
this capacity?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STORRAR:     I would pick three.   By the way, I would like to thank the Bank&#13;
for giving me the opportunity to do this.      It's probably been the most&#13;
rewarding time, in a way, I had in the Bank, being asked to look at the&#13;
continent which I knew well and to look at some of its quite important&#13;
problems.    First thing I looked at was the problem of onchocerciasis--river&#13;
blindness--in West Africa.     The Bank has cofinanced an eradication program&#13;
there over the last ten years, and I see, by the way, they have refinanced&#13;
a continuation of that.     There just can be no question that what they've&#13;
done to alleviate human suffering there is quite outstanding.     You find&#13;
people who no longer go blind, and the reward in human terms from that is&#13;
just quite enormous.     I didn't have enough time to look into the economics&#13;
of it but I would have a grave doubt if it could be proved to be&#13;
economically viable, so let's stay with it more on the human plane than on&#13;
the other.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But I ended up with serious doubts on this one.     I think there are very&#13;
serious problems.     Number one, in consulting particularly the headquarters&#13;
in Upper Volta--now Burkina Faso--headed, by the way, mainly by very&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                             -28-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
competent Africans, in the international headquarters there, it does seem&#13;
that there's no great likelihood that the nations, the individual nations&#13;
themselves, would give a priority to a policy such that reinvasion would&#13;
not take place.   And I would have to go along with this.   If you look at&#13;
any other problems in Africa, such as tsetse fly, recent history shows you&#13;
quite clearly that this was not a priority in terms of governments.     And&#13;
where it depends on intergovernment cooperation, surely Africa is full of&#13;
historic events which shows you that this is just not something that's in&#13;
the minds of the governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Secondly, it seems that eventually when they go further down in the&#13;
rivers there and you get into Guinea the problem is almost insoluble.    As&#13;
you probably know, the flies breed only in running water, in the rivers,&#13;
and virtually all the treatment is by helicopter, which is a highly&#13;
dangerous game and in fact in many areas treatment from the air is&#13;
impossible.   And I left there feeling that, number one, for human reasons&#13;
obviously we were quite correct in what we were doing in getting rid of&#13;
this.   And I'll never forget the joy of the people there who used to suffer&#13;
and no longer did.   But I guess that they would have to concern themselves&#13;
with the idea that in the long term this would have to be run on an&#13;
international basis and not a national basisand financed through the Bank&#13;
whether they get bilateral or multilateral finance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I don't think it would work just to run some sort of loose cooperative&#13;
effort by the countries.   First of all, I don't think a lot of them have&#13;
the technical know-how to deal with it anyway, and secondly if it's let&#13;
slip, it only takes a very short time to come back.   And this is no&#13;
different from tsetse, the next thing I'd like to just mention.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I looked at the whole question of tsetse in Africa because the World&#13;
Bank has a lot of projects situated in the tsetse areas.    What we found, to&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                               -29-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR)&#13;
&#13;
my astonishment, is that prior to the invasion, if you like, of the&#13;
European races into Africa, tsetse in fact was really very localized and&#13;
the records show this quite clearly, but the moment you get transhumance,&#13;
then the problem starts to grow because these insects move, they move in&#13;
vehicles, they move with people, they move with livestock.      Although they&#13;
also move with game, game doesn't move as far distant as many people think&#13;
in their annual migration.     And so what happened was that when colonization&#13;
took place, roads were developed, the country was opened up, so they opened&#13;
up the country for flies.     And indeed they expanded very rapidly, right&#13;
throughout Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    However, the colonial governments attended to this problem.      By the&#13;
way, one of the first jobs I ever had to do in Kenya, when I first went out&#13;
as an agricultural officer, was the clearing of bush in a tsetse-infested&#13;
area. In another area where the bush had all been cleared off I found the&#13;
land was absolutely eroding to blazes and I had the job of putting in soil&#13;
conservation to stop it eroding.     By the time I left Kenya, that had gone&#13;
back to bush and when I was back in Kenya about five years ago they were&#13;
busy clearing it again!&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Anyway, the colonial government set up tsetse departments and they&#13;
pushed back the fly barriers very, very strongly, especially in countries&#13;
like Kenya and Zimbabwe.     In Zambia they were very successful, such that in&#13;
many, many areas they're completely cleared.      But since independence two&#13;
things have happened.     Well, since independence the fly has not only come&#13;
back to the boundaries that it had before colonization, but actually has&#13;
expanded beyond that.     The reasons being, number one, that no great&#13;
priority was given to tsetse control by the governments, I won't bring all&#13;
the reasons for this, but that was one.      And of course the other was civil&#13;
disturbance.   A good example of this, for instance, was the fighting&#13;
between Tanzania and Uganda, where there was no fly control of any kind.&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                               -30-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
And so what's happened is that they had to abandon the tsetse control and&#13;
the country was reinvaded very seriously.      Mozambique, by the way, has been&#13;
completely reinvaded.     Tsetse fly has expanded beyond any boundary that was&#13;
ever known before, and this is clearly going to become a problem for the&#13;
Bank to deal with.     And exactly how it should be dealt with needs&#13;
examination.     You can either deal with aerial sprayings, which is in now,&#13;
which is all very well up to a point, but if you leave only a couple of&#13;
flies, male and female, you've got them all back again.      I do not believe&#13;
this to be the appropriate approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And I leave this with the thought.       It's going to have to be controlled&#13;
to a point, there's no question, and they're doing some wonderful work in&#13;
Zimbabwe at the moment.     Any staff member of the Bank that's got time off&#13;
should go and see it.     They are working very simply with traps that cost&#13;
very little indeed, and really attract the flies.      They've been tried on a&#13;
substantial scale and have reached eighty or ninety percent success already&#13;
with this very simplistic approach.     This means that they can get rid of&#13;
the vast bulk of the fly with a system that can be operated by the most&#13;
primitive African people and maintained very easily.      So I look forward to&#13;
an Africa where they will not be free of fly, but the fly will reach the&#13;
point that it will not be of any great danger to human beings or to the&#13;
animals.     And I do hope that the Bank will continue to look at this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Lastly, the question of technical assistance, which is another burning&#13;
issue.     I did have a look at this and I would like to put this on this&#13;
particular record for years to come.     I looked at this with colleagues from&#13;
the Bank and what we found was, and it's an astonishing situation, but&#13;
there were about 150,000 people operating as technical assistants in Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa, purely in the public and the parastatal parts of these&#13;
countries.     You have to ask yourself a question.   Here are these countries&#13;
where their economies are really in reverse.      You have this enormous&#13;
contingent of people that is costing the world six billion dollars per&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                              -31-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR]&#13;
year, of which the Bank supplies about $450 million a year--no small&#13;
amount--and they provide little benefit to the country.       I realize that I'm&#13;
beginning to come in circle from what I talked about before.       But what is&#13;
quite clear is that the views of the African governments and the views of&#13;
donor group or the lending group of the Bank are widely different.       The&#13;
African people themselves really feel that there is no need to have foreign&#13;
people help them develop their country.     They say the foreign people only&#13;
come for a couple of years, don't get to know the problems of Africa and&#13;
they get very highly paid, and so on and so forth, and this is all just a&#13;
guise to give people employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The international groups like the World Bank are aware of the fact that&#13;
the way the projects are designed, the Africans are going to need a certain&#13;
amount of foreign help in order to make them work.       And I believe that this&#13;
is one thing the Bank is going to have to look at very, very carefully over&#13;
the next few years, and I'm sure it will.    Let's not try and be arrogant&#13;
enough to offer a total solution to this, but if it's correct that the&#13;
Africans don't appreciate the technical assistance they are being given at&#13;
the moment--and much of it for good reason--if it's correct the economies&#13;
are in reverse rather than going ahead--which we know anyway--then if it is&#13;
also correct that the type of rather more sophisticated--not too&#13;
sophisticated--projects the Bank would have, especially in agricultural&#13;
development, then clearly they are going to need a high level of management&#13;
and technical competence if they're going to be successful.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I think they should examine carefully by--never has this been done--of&#13;
the need to take it more or less as read that a nucleus of people is going&#13;
to be required.    All right, if that's correct, then number one they must be&#13;
people who are acceptable to the Africans.       And I think the sooner this is&#13;
done the better.    They have to be consulted.     And they are not really at&#13;
the moment.   Let's face it.&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                                 -32-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[STORRAR)&#13;
    The final thing which I think is more important is I cannot conceive on&#13;
the part of the African people in any one given country can continue to&#13;
accept temporary, continually temporary technical assistance.         Because if&#13;
they do, how can the foreign technical assistants be acceptable if they&#13;
don't know the people, they don't speak the language?         All the many things&#13;
in Kenya, Nigeria, whatever.       It seems to me that unless we are going to&#13;
get people who are prepared to--I almost sound like a born-again&#13;
Christian--but you know to give their life to this sort of thing.         And&#13;
let's get off the namby pambies.      Not because they think it's the best&#13;
thing to do, but because they like it.         There are plenty of people in the&#13;
world who, if given an opportunity, would still be happy by preference to&#13;
work in places like Africa or Indonesia and continue to work there for many&#13;
years with one proviso:       that somebody will underwrite their career,&#13;
because we must never kid ourselves and that to try and take up a career&#13;
with what is a foreign government in Africa makes any sense at all, because&#13;
it doesn't.    There's no security of any sort.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So I would still think that somebody ought to reexamine how we can&#13;
provide a core of competent people whose careers and salaries would be&#13;
reasonably well underwritten.      I used to argue in ADS that on a five-year&#13;
contract, after four years they tell a man whether his contract would be&#13;
rewritten or not with the Bank and that would be reasonable security, and I&#13;
think most people would accept that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:    As I recall, Barbara Ward wrote something of a similar nature in&#13;
the mid-sixties.&#13;
&#13;

STORRAR:    That's correct.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:    Essentially setting up a world-wide agriculture development&#13;
service of sorts.&#13;
&amp;#12;STORRAR                                  -33-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STORRAR:     Absolutely, and for exactly the same reason.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But I'll just come back to the core point again, and at that point&#13;
we'll sign off I guess from the many strong views that I have on these sort&#13;
of things.     You know, we've got to separate the men from the boys here.        If&#13;
you're going to the developing world to make a huge income--and people do&#13;
and you have to pay for people to get there--you're choosing the wrong sort&#13;
of people.     People who go there only as do-gooders are not really going to&#13;
come true either.     What we are seeking are people who feel as part of their&#13;
life's work to get out there and to be reasonably well paid--no&#13;
question--but in return for that to be committed.        Not to be running back,&#13;
if you like, to the USDA, or the British Government or wherever it is.          But&#13;
committed to the developing world and the problems of the developing world.&#13;
Now that sounds a very missionary sort of attitude, but I believe it to be&#13;
real, and I believe that there are people you an find in all developing&#13;
countries to be quite willing to do so.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And I will just sign off on this point indeed.        I happen to be, if you&#13;
like, chairman of a consultancy company in this country, and there are lots&#13;
and lots of young men we come across that we would very much like to&#13;
employ, but we can't.       We've got nowhere to get them started.   They would&#13;
be very happy to go overseas.        They want to work overseas, but we can't get&#13;
them started.     We can't afford to start them off in this.     Whereas if you&#13;
had a big organization like the one I'm talking about who could afford to&#13;
bring these people in slowly and build up their competence--and by the way,&#13;
not just Europeans, but all people of competence--you could join it and&#13;
make a contribution.        I believe this is something that the world needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:     Well, Mr. Storrar, it's been a very, very interesting interview.&#13;
On behalf of the Oral History Program of the World Bank I thank you very&#13;
much.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STORRAR:     My pleasure.&#13;

            In August 1986, Alexander Storrar was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Charles Ziegler. During his tenure at the
            Bank from 1965 to 1983, Mr. Storrar worked in the following
            areas: in Nairobi and Kenya as head of the agricultural
            development service (1965-1969); in the agriculture
            department on the project staff (1969-1973); in the East
            Asia and Pacific (EAP) project department as an agricultural
            advisor (1973-1978); as chief of resident mission in
            Bangladesh (1978-1982); and as a senior advisor to the staff
            resources program (1982-1983). His transcript concerns
            fly-borne diseases and river blindness in Africa,
            involvement of Barbara Ward, George Woods, and Lord Howick
            in the establishment of the agricultural development
            service, and his contribution to the Bank as senior adviser.
