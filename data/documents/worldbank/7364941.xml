Objectives and&#13;
Description:           The objective o f the project i s to increase the volume o f private&#13;
                       investment and productive jobs in Afghanistan.        The specific&#13;
                       goals that will contribute to this are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                           0    Enhance the provision o f land and infrastructural services&#13;
                                for enterprise development&#13;
                           0    Enhance the capacity o f government agencies to analyze&#13;
                                PSD issues, and develop and implement PSD-related&#13;
                                strategies, policies and programs&#13;
                           0    Enhance the capacity o f government agencies to promote&#13;
                                Afghanistan as an investment destination and provide&#13;
                                investment facilitation services.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectBenefits:       By helping to address the land constraint this project will attract&#13;
                       private investment in a variety o f sectors, including but not&#13;
                       limited to manufacturing, agribusiness,         and smaller scale&#13;
                       infrastructure projects. The industrial park will help stimulate the&#13;
                       local economy, generate employment, and raise much needed tax&#13;
                       revenues.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectRisks:          Security remains a concern. If the security situation deteriorates,&#13;
                       private investors may shy away from investing in Afghanistan&#13;
                       despite the presence o f the industrial parks. Also, effective&#13;
                       sanctioning,   monitoring, and legal systems are only just&#13;
                       emerging. Effective contract enforcement i s essential to the&#13;
&#13;
                                             ...&#13;

&#13;
A.       Constraintsto PrivateSector DevelopmentinAfghanistan'&#13;
&#13;
1.       Electric Power. As in many developing countries, inadequate and unreliable power supply i s a&#13;
major constraint on private sector activity, particularly in the industrial sector. According to the&#13;
Afghanistan Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) carried out in 2005, inadequate power supply i s the&#13;
most important constraint faced by Afghan investors. 64 percent o f surveyed firms cited this as a major or&#13;
severe constraint; for one city, Le., Jalalabad, this figure i s 90 percent. Due to a combination o f the direct&#13;
effects o f war, a lack o f maintenance, and the theft o f spare parts and equipment - the power supply i s&#13;
erratic and unreliable. In addition to generation problems, Afghanistan has no national grid and suffers&#13;
from severe transmission and distribution limitations. Lack o f adequate power supply increases costs for&#13;
private firms who are forced to make alternative arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Land. Unclear ownership o f land i s a major constraint to investment inAfghanistan. According to&#13;
the I C A survey, this is the second most important constraint faced by Afghan investors with 60 percent o f&#13;
the surveyed firms identifying this as a major or severe constraint. Land titling in Afghanistan i s difficult&#13;
and multiple ownership documents exist for the same piece o f land. The return o f refugees i s&#13;
compounding the problem, with disputes being common. The scope for resolving disputes through the&#13;
court system i s limited given inadequate court capacity, small number o f judges with necessary legal&#13;
expertise and insufficient guidance provided by law. Property rights are thus unclear and insecure. Land&#13;
cannot be collateralized easily and hence cannot be used to generate financial resources or set up small&#13;
businesses.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Access tofinance. Banking services in Afghanistan remain severely limited. The passage o f the&#13;
Central Banking Law and the Commercial Banking Law in September 2003, and the entry o f several&#13;
commercial banks mark significant progress. But there i s much to be done before financial services are&#13;
restored to a level required for meaningful trade and investment activities. The state financial institutions,&#13;
which have the largest national infrastructure, are largely non-functional although Government i s&#13;
contemplating measures to revive the good assets in two public sector banks and channel them in ways&#13;
that improve access to finance. Some o f the new private banks are lending to industrybut on a very small&#13;
scale. Local enterprises suffer from a shortage o f capital, and trading activity and industrial development&#13;
have been adversely affected. Access to finance was listed as the fourth most important constraint by&#13;
firms surveyed for the Afghanistan Investment Climate Assessment (2005); it was cited by 51 percent o f&#13;
the firms as a major or severe constraint.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Labor. Because o f the low literacy levels and lack o f other formal training facilities, qualified&#13;
management level staff i s scarcely available and most labor training takes place on the job. This problem&#13;
i s exacerbated by barriers against women being employed in certain jobs, as well as a dysfunctional&#13;
education system in terms o f preparing students to exploit future labor market opportunities. Because&#13;
such formal employment opportunities are very few, hrther skill enhancement, including that for women,&#13;
i s not forthcoming. The weak legal framework within the country implies an unclear definition o f labor&#13;
rights. As a result, it i s difficult to develop and enforce contracts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'Thissection  draws uponWorld Bank (2005): TheInvestment Climate in Afghanistan: Exploiting Opportunities in&#13;
an Uncertain Environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.         Security. Security remains a major problem for private enterprises in Afghanistan although the&#13;
severity may differ between locations. Poor security increases the risks o f investment, and thereby deters&#13;
investors, particularly foreign investors, who have other places to invest. Poor security also raises the&#13;
costs for existing businesses, e.g., through the need to hire security guards. It also raises transport costs in&#13;
general by imposing limitations on operating hours, restricting the flexibility of truck operations,&#13;
and sometimes requiring the use of convoy systems. According to the 2005 ICA, firms spend, on&#13;
average, 15 percent o f their revenues in addressing security needs. This i s at least five times higher than&#13;
the security costs incurredby firms inother countries inthe region.&#13;
&#13;
6.         Risk mitigation. Insecurity as well as other factors such as the country's fragile economic&#13;
situation, coupled with weak legal and regulatory frameworks for the private sector, and a hugely&#13;
undevelopedjudicial system increases the perceived political risk of doing business inAfghanistan. While&#13;
there i s real and substantial interest from foreign private investors inAfghanistan, and strong government&#13;
encouragement o f FDI, the political risks will act as a major impediment to FDI flows to the country.&#13;
Domestically, also, Afghanistan i s acutely under insured. The Afghan National Insurance Company&#13;
(ANIC), the sole insurance company operating in the country, enjoys a monopoly on all insurance&#13;
functions, suffers fiom a lack o f trained staff and has a poor track record in paying out on legitimate&#13;
claims. Lack o f insurance has a serious effect on private sector activity. For example, most international&#13;
shipping lines do not allow their containers into the country. Within Afghanistan, cargo moves under&#13;
either owners' risk or carriers' liability (at much higher freight rates), both o f which discourage trade.&#13;
Without guarantees against political risks, many investors will be unwilling to do business in&#13;
Afghanistan.2&#13;
&#13;
7.         Transport and trade logistics. Transit related trade costs are high in Afghanistan due to&#13;
inefficiencies in the present transit system including: a) non-existent, or poor state, o f trade and transit&#13;
infrastructure, b) very poor condition o f the road network; c) the short internal hauls on many o f the&#13;
transit routes; d) insecurity; and, e) the numerous checkpoints along the routes. With limited exception o f&#13;
some direct road transport from Karachi to Kabul, all o f Afghanistan's foreign trade i s transshipped,&#13;
which raises costs directly (e.g., handling charges) and indirectly (loss and damage). International&#13;
shipping lines do not allow their containers into the country. Most o f the cargo, subjected to multiple&#13;
handling, i s thus break bulk cargo, and most vulnerable to handling loss and damage. Coordination&#13;
between transporters in Afghanistan and transit countries, and between shippers and customs officials, i s&#13;
poor because o f the lack o f professional transit agents and poor communications. A local freight-&#13;
forwarding industry existed and was very active prior to 1975, but i s non-existent today. There are no&#13;
norms o f accreditation for fieight-forwarders. Some international freight-forwarders are currently&#13;
operating inAfghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
8.         Regulatory burden. Although there have been improvements in the regulatory regime, such as&#13;
streamlining o f the business registration, customs procedures and trade licensing systems, there are still&#13;
numerous examples o f excessive regulatory burdens. For example, the transaction costs o f transporting&#13;
goods within Afghanistan are raised directly by multiple fees and taxes, and indirectly by the delays and&#13;
uncertainties that the multiple checkpoints along the routes i m p ~ s eProvincial agencies interfere with&#13;
                                                                                       . ~&#13;
operations by often imposing informal procedural requirements. Dealing with municipalities remains a&#13;
&#13;
 Inresponseto this situation, MIGA, together with the World Bank/IDA, the AsianDevelopmentBank, andthe governments of&#13;
Germanyandthe UnitedKingdom, has set up the AfghanistanInvestment Guarantee Facility (AIGF) to providerisk mitigation&#13;
tools, to foreign investors (including Afghan Diaspora) investinginAfghanistan.The Facilityhas recentlyissued its first&#13;
guarantee.3 Commercialfreight vehicles are still requiredto register with the Ministry ofTransport for everyjourney that they&#13;
makewithin Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                               2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
big hassle. While business registration and overall trade licensing have been streamlined, obtaining&#13;
specific licenses, e.g., for operating in certain sector such as pharmaceuticals, may still take considerable&#13;
time. Onerous regulatory procedures are often associated with corruption. The 2005 ICA identifies&#13;
corruption as the thirdmost important constraint faced by investors with 53% o f the surveyed firms citing&#13;
this as a major or severe constraint.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Legal framework for private sector development. Private sector development requires a&#13;
conducive legal framework and a fair and effective judicial system. Disputes need to be settled and&#13;
contracts enforced. Propertyrights and investment need to be adequately protected. Businesses needto be&#13;
able to start up easily, to function efficiently while they are inoperation, and to exit the market in a timely&#13;
and efficient manner. Afghanistan has inheritedmany laws, regulations and procedures that tend to inhibit&#13;
trade and investment instead o f encouraging it. An active program o f legal reforms i s currently underway&#13;
in Afghanistan with considerable donor support although the proposed investment law has faced&#13;
considerable delays in gaining approval. Adaptation o f foreign laws to the Afghan context and&#13;
translations o f English drafts are important challenges to legislative reform in Afghanistan. Also&#13;
important i s the need to enhance the enforcement o f legal decisions; unless such enforcement can be&#13;
ensured, the legalreforms underway will not have the desired impact.&#13;
&#13;
10.      Quality and standards. Afghanistan has no metrology, standards, testing and quality (MSTQ)&#13;
infrastructure; as a result the country i s often a dumping ground for sub-standard goods. Export&#13;
development i s inhibited given the high quality standards now demanded by international markets,&#13;
especially for ago-based products. Without a proper MSTQ system, enterprises are unable to access&#13;
information related to standards, calibration and product testing facilities. Existing limited arrangements&#13;
for quality control are generally ineffective. The Government i s now taking modest steps towards setting&#13;
up a quality system with a National Standards, Metrology and Quality Board having been established&#13;
recently.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Assets locked up in non-functional state-owned enterprises. Afghanistan has about 65 state&#13;
owned enterprises many o f which are defunct and none o f them are operating at full capacity. There are&#13;
another 13 state-owned commercial entities that are registered under the Corporations and not called&#13;
SOEs but could be considered as SOEs for all practical purposes. In addition, several line ministries have&#13;
a wide activities of commercial activities, including real estate, that are organized as budgetary units.&#13;
Most SOEs lack resources to carry out major restructuring. Moreover, many are overstaffed and lack&#13;
management capability to increase capacity utilization. Many SOEs have considerable amount o f surplus&#13;
land attached to them that i s not required to operate the enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
12.      Private sector capacity constraints. The private sector suffers from serious capacity constraints.&#13;
One manifestation o f i s in the construction industry,where participation o f Afghan companies has been&#13;
constrained by limited experience, insufficient equipment and unfamiliarity with competitive tendering&#13;
procedures. In general, the private sector needs assistance in accessing market information, business&#13;
development services, technology and managerial know-how. There i s need for a critical mass o f private&#13;
sector service providers in these areas. Since many o f these services may not amenable to full-cost&#13;
recovery at least not initially, public-private partnerships will be required.&#13;
&#13;
13.      Institutional framework for private sector development policy. Several ministries and agencies&#13;
have responsibilities related to private sector development. Coordination among these bodies is critical.&#13;
The High Commission for Investment provides a forum for such coordination but procedures and&#13;
practices must be in place to encourage coordination without necessarily having to go through the High&#13;
Commission. The Government has established AISA with a mandate to promote foreign investment and&#13;
facilitate business. Established inAugust 2003, AISA i s faced with the challenge o f attracting investment&#13;
ina tough global marketplace that has little positive information about the country. It has made a good&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
beginning with regard to facilitating investors but i s still in the early stages o f developing its corporate&#13;
identity, strategy, andbusiness plan. At the request of the Government, the World Bank Group conducted&#13;
an assessment o f AISA in order to identify areas o f comparative strength and constraint. This assessment&#13;
was followed by a three-year business plan, developed by MIGA with an aim to identify actions that will&#13;
help AISA to become a world-class investment promotion intermediary. Recently, AISA has developed&#13;
an organizational restructuringplan, drawing partly upon the business plan.&#13;
&#13;
 14.      An important aspect o fthe institutional framework for PSD is the role o fprivate sector collective&#13;
bodies and their interaction with the government. The Afghan Chamber o f Commerce, which has existed&#13;
for many years, i s essentially a government agency with a number o f regulatory functions. The future o f&#13;
this institutionis under discussion - it appears that the government intends to streamline its functions and&#13;
convert it to a truly private sector chamber. Meanwhile, a number o f independent private sector collective&#13;
bodies have emerged and are active. These include the Afghanistan International Chamber o f Commerce&#13;
(AICC), the Afghan-American Chamber o f Commerce (AACC) and several sectoral associations. The&#13;
Government has recently appointed a commission to develop a vision for the development o f chambers o f&#13;
commerce in the country, including deciding the future o f the quasi-government Afghan Chamber o f&#13;
Commerce.&#13;
&#13;
15.      Export promotion. Greater export orientation i s an important aspect o f the Government's private&#13;
sector development vision. This will require a successful export promotion effort involving collaboration&#13;
between the public and private sectors. The Export Promotion Department in the M o C has an explicit&#13;
mandate to promote and facilitate exports. However, it suffers from weak capacity, including lack o f&#13;
many basic shlls, and has lost contacts in developed countries after the shift in trade flows away from&#13;
these countries since the mid-1970s. The Government i s seriously considering revamping its export&#13;
promotion efforts.&#13;
&#13;
B.       GovernmentResponses&#13;
&#13;
16.      Macro-economic stability and fiscal reforms. The GOA has been remarkably successful in&#13;
establishing a stable macro-economic environment. Currency reform was completed in early 2003 and&#13;
since then inflation has been around 10 per cent and the currency stable. The government has shown&#13;
strong fiscal discipline and has implemented a no overdraft policy where they refrain from printing&#13;
money to finance a deficit. The government has also followed a prudent debt policy and has sought most&#13;
o f its external assistance in grants or highly concessional credits. The tax code was restructured in 2004&#13;
to expand and simplify the code. The gross profit tax rate is now 21.4 percent, compared with 35 percent&#13;
for the region and 46 percent inthe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).&#13;
&#13;
17.      External trade. The government has taken a number o f steps to foster trade and reestablish&#13;
relationships with trading partners. Customs tariffs have been rationalized, existing trade agreements&#13;
have been renewed and new agreements entered. The government has promised to build a trade regime&#13;
that will allow Afghanistan to enter the World Trade Organization within the next few years. Trade has&#13;
increased dramatically with the value o f annual exports and imports growing at double digit levels.&#13;
However, most o f the exports are re-exports to Pakistan suggesting that the increase in trade does not&#13;
reflect an increase inAfghanistan's international competitiveness.&#13;
&#13;
18.      Financial sector reforms. There has been significant progress indeveloping the financial sector.&#13;
The D a Afghanistan Bank (DAB) and Banking Laws have been gazetted (i.e., formally enacted) and a&#13;
number o f commercial banks licensed. DAB has divested its headquarters-based commercial banking&#13;
activities and divestment will be extended to branches in provinces where commercial banks are active.&#13;
Three state-owned banks (Mille, Pashtany, and Export Promotion) have been relicensed, with corrective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
action provisions to improve performance. Progress has also been made in developing the microfinance&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
19.      Emphasis on private sector development. The government has clearly recognized that&#13;
Afghanistan's success will depend upon its ability to quickly develop a strong and vibrant private sector.&#13;
Private sector development i s one o f the priority areas for the Afghanistan National Development Strategy&#13;
(ANDs), which is the GOA's overarching strategy for promoting growth, generatingwealth and reducing&#13;
poverty and vulnerability. The World Bank's Interim Support Strategy strongly supports GOA's strategy.&#13;
However, to meet this strategy and implement private sector dominance inthe economy, there i s need for&#13;
stronger GOA commitment to address private sector constrains pertaining to economic and physical&#13;
infrastructure, regulatoryregime and corruption.&#13;
&#13;
20.      Institutions for private sector development.         The Government established the Afghanistan&#13;
Investment Support Agency (AISA) in 2003 as an independent institution with its own organizational&#13;
structure.   AISA's core function i s domestic and foreign investment promotion. This comprises&#13;
registrationo f business to provide a legal identity, facilitation for obtaining other approvals required to set&#13;
up or operate a business and investment promotional work within and outside the country, e.g.,&#13;
organization o f business workshop and trade fare or road show, etc. The other function that AISA&#13;
performs i s to facilitate construction o f industrial parks to alleviate land problems o f the investors. This&#13;
function i s undertaken by the Industrial Parks Department, created within AISA. AISA has had a good&#13;
track so far in facilitating business entry. It has helped register about 3500 firms since its establishment in&#13;
August 2003. It is planning to open regional offices and is preparing papers on sectoral opportunities.&#13;
With United Nations Development Program (UNDP) assistance, AISA has also completed work on a&#13;
database o f 6000 companies which were registered prior to the establishment o f AISA. The runningcosts&#13;
o f AHA are partly funded by GTZ on a decreasing scale. This i s for 4 years and will end in 2007.&#13;
However, AISA earns substantial income from licenses which i s adequate to meet its current operational&#13;
costs.    Going forward, one o f the main challenges for AISA i s long-term institutional development,&#13;
especially inthe area o f investment support and policy advocacy.&#13;
&#13;
21.      The PRR Stage 1 application for the Ministry o f Commerce (MoCI) was approved in August&#13;
2005 followed by approval o f the PRR Stage 2 application in June 2006. The restructuring in the&#13;
Ministry has led to the creation of a number of directorates. In addition to the functional directorates&#13;
dealing with human resources, finance, administration, and research and planning, there are four thematic&#13;
directorates dealing with: a) International Trade, b) Transit and Trade Facilitation, c) Private Sector&#13;
Development, and d) State-owned Enterprises. The Ministry has come up with a capacity building&#13;
program with the objective o f developing the policy formulation, implementation and evaluation skills&#13;
and knowledge appropriate to each level o f personnel.&#13;
&#13;
22.      Infrastructure and utilities. A power sector master plan outlining an investment program to help&#13;
rebuild the power infrastructure has been adopted. Implementation o f the investment program has started&#13;
and has focused on rehabilitation o f damaged generation capacity for Kabul and Kandahar, construction&#13;
o f transmission lines from existing hydro plants to Kabul, and the Northern Transmission System, which&#13;
will allow import o f lowcost power from Uzbekistan to Kabul (expected completion by end o f 2008). In&#13;
addition, there is investment inrehabilitation and expansion o fthe distribution systems inKabul and other&#13;
cities. There i s also a proposal for a combined cycle generation turbine plant at Shebergan that could add&#13;
lOOMW to 150MW o f generation capacity and is a good opportunity for an international management&#13;
contract. There are three private mobile operators (one o f these was recently licensed). Competition&#13;
between the privately owned mobile networks has resulted in prices consistent with international noms.&#13;
The publicly owned, fixed-line telecom provider, Afghan Tel has been corporatized. Rehabilitating the&#13;
roadnetwork has been a top priority for the government, which has developed a large investment program&#13;
for major highways, including rehabilitation o f the existing network, completion o f the network, and, over&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
time; construction o f new roads. Despite some delays there have been noticeable improvements in some&#13;
areas with some improvements intravel times already beginning to materialize. Inaddition to work on the&#13;
main highways, there have been efforts to repair and improve smaller roads, primarily through public&#13;
works employment programs, most notably the National Emergency Employment Program. Nonetheless,&#13;
there i s still a long way to go inrehabilitating the highway system and completing its segments including&#13;
the remaining "ring" connection in Northwest Afghanistan. In addition, the government has revived&#13;
Ariana, the public sector airline and licensed a number o f private airlines.&#13;

Arrangements for resultsmonitoring&#13;
&#13;
The Industrial Parks Department and the recently created Policy and Research Department in the&#13;
Afghanistan Investment Support Agency will have overall responsibility for implementing the results&#13;
monitoring system as well as specific responsibility for monitoring the results o f the industrial park and&#13;
AISA-capacity building components o f the project. In addition, the Private Sector Development&#13;
Department in the M o C I will implement the results monitoring system for the capacity buildingprogram&#13;
in the Ministry.The project will also support the development and implementation of a broader results&#13;
monitoring system for PSD issues and results monitoring for the project components will be part of this&#13;
process. The specific arrangements for the specific components are discussed below and summarized in&#13;
the Table.&#13;
&#13;
i) Industrial park component.       The industrial parks component will support the construction o f one&#13;
industrial park as well as the development o f policy, regulatory and institutional capacity for an overall&#13;
industrial park development program. The results monitoring framework will cover both aspects. For the&#13;
industrial park to be supported by the project, each tenant will be required to submit data on a prescribed&#13;
format to the Industrial Parks Department in AISA. While AISA may require more frequent reporting for&#13;
i t s own purposes, the project will require quarterly reporting on production, employment, sales and&#13;
exports, and annual reporting on investments. The Industrial Park Department will collate the data and&#13;
provide them to IDA within a month after receiving them from the enterprises. The Department will also&#13;
provide quarterly progress reports to IDA during the construction phase o f the park. These progress&#13;
reports will include information on the progress with park construction, allocation o f plots, and&#13;
construction o f factory buildings by tenants and commissioning o f plants. This monitoring exercise is&#13;
separate from the monitoring o f environmental practices and work place conditions, which will be part o f&#13;
the environmental and social management plan (discussed inAnnex 10).&#13;
&#13;
Progress with regardto the policy, regulatory and institutional framework for industrialpark development&#13;
will be monitored by examining the drafting and enactment o frelevant policies, laws andregulations.&#13;
&#13;
ii;, AISA institutional development and capacity building. The results monitoring framework for this&#13;
component will have two .parts. First, improvements in AISA's investment promotion capacity will be&#13;
assessed through third-party surveys, such as MIGA's "mystery investor" surveys. In such surveys&#13;
investigators assess performance o f an investment promotion agency, such as responsiveness to investors,&#13;
by masquerading as investors. Such surveys will be carried out on an annual basis. In addition, a full-&#13;
blown capacity assessment will be carried out by MIGA as a part o f the mid-term review o f the project.&#13;
This will be similar to the assessment carried out in late 2004 which will serve as a benchmark. The&#13;
second dimension o f the results framework will assess the efficacy o f AISA's investment facilitation&#13;
function. The specific indicator to be used is the time taken and cost incurred to open a typical business.&#13;
The recently created Policy and Research Department inAISA will oversee the collection o f data for this.&#13;
Itwill collaborate with the private sector chambers inthe collection and interpretationo fthe data.&#13;
&#13;
iii) Ministry of Commerce and Industry capacity building. Results monitoring for this component will be&#13;
the responsibility o f the Private Sector Development Directorate. The DFID advisors in the Ministrywill&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
assist in this task. The main objective o f the capacity building exercise in the MoCI i s to help formulate&#13;
and implement PSD policies effectively. This i s difficult to measure and hence, the focus will be on two&#13;
measurable indicators: a) indices o f staff capacities in a small number o f critical areas (to be determined&#13;
later), and b) private sector satisfaction with the policy dialogue and policy formulation process. The&#13;
former will be monitored through staff assessments while the latter will be monitored through surveys of&#13;
the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                          TECHNICALANNEX4: DETAILEDPROJECT                DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
                      AFGHANISTAN:PRIVATESECTOR DEVELOPMENT                   PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Component1: Developmentof industrialparks(US$24.00m.)&#13;
&#13;
The GOA has identified industrial park development as an important plank o f its private sector&#13;
development strategy. It plans to develop industrial parks in various parts o f Afghanistan in an effort to&#13;
engender regional balance in industrial growth. It also proposes to involve the private sector in the&#13;
development and operation o f the estates.&#13;
&#13;
The emphasis on industrial park development i s a response to the difficulties investors face in acquiring&#13;
land with a clear title for setting up production facilities. Industrial parks are also viewed as an effective&#13;
means o f focusing the provision o f infrastructural and utility services, currently in short supply in&#13;
Afghanistan. The parks will provide physical infrastructure that guarantees a high degree o f self&#13;
sufficiency in terms o f essential utilities such as water and power supply, collection ad treatment o f&#13;
liquid as well as solid wastes. Given the difficult socio-economic and post conflict conditions in&#13;
Afghanistan and the nation's tremendous capital needs for reconstruction investments, the Government i s&#13;
anxious to ensure the economical utilization o f scarce funds. Finally, industrial parks will provide a&#13;
secure environment to carry out production activities. The concentration o f a critical mass o f industrial&#13;
enterprises in a park will also facilitate the provision o f business development services to the firms as&#13;
well as generate opportunities for firm-to-firm learning and knowledge diffusion.&#13;
&#13;
The institutional mandate for industrial park development i s in the process o f being clarified.&#13;
Historically, the Ministry o f Light Industry was in charge o f the industrial park development program.&#13;
With the creation o f a combined Commerce and IndustryMinistry,this mandate has now passed to the&#13;
new ministry. The Ministry, however, has very limited capacity to run an effective industrial parks&#13;
program. A new department has been created within AISA and given responsibility for developing&#13;
specific industrial parks, such as the three parks currently under development in Bagrami (near Kabul),&#13;
Mazar-e-Sharif and Kandahar, and the two parks to be supported by this project. AISA expects the&#13;
entire responsibility for industrial park development to be vested in them. However, a decision on this&#13;
has not yet been taken.&#13;
&#13;
The Government recognizes the importance o f an adequate policy, regulatory and institutional&#13;
framework for industrial park development, including private participation in the development and&#13;
management o f the parks. In response to a Government request, in 2004, MIGA prepared a set o f&#13;
recommendations on these areas in conjunction with an institutional analysis conducted for AISA. The&#13;
implementation of the Government's industrial park development program will require a strong&#13;
industrial park development agency with adequate mandate and budgets, and qualified staff. The&#13;
program should be guided by a clear strategy about the role o f industrial parks in Afghanistan's&#13;
development and implementedwithin an appropriate policy and regulatory framework.&#13;
&#13;
Infrastructure development in the first cohort o f industrial parks has commenced, with USAJD support.&#13;
Work i s most advanced inthe Bagrami industrial park where 34 plots have been allocated. Physical work&#13;
on developingthe 24 hectare park i s near complete and several industrial units are inthe process o f being&#13;
built and some are already inoperation. There is additional land adjacent to the site where an expansion&#13;
o f the park i s possible. Two additional parks are being developed in Mazar-e-Sharif (with ADB&#13;
assistance) and in Sharandow-Kandahar.&#13;
&#13;
Considering the high demand for the allocation o f industrial plots by a number o f growing industrial&#13;
entrepreneurs in Kabul, the GOAhas decided to build up additional industrial parks in order to meet&#13;
&#13;
                                                     14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
investor needs and support the development o fjob opportunities. AISA has been given the responsibility&#13;
for developing two additional parks at Kamari (near Kabul) and at Hissar-e-Shahi (near Jalalabad), in&#13;
addition to its current responsibilities for the three industrial parks in Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif and&#13;
Kandahar. This mandate has been formalized through the issuance o f a Presidential order on March 11,&#13;
2006.&#13;
&#13;
This component will support the Government's Industrial Park development programintwo areas:&#13;
&#13;
     Infrastructure development at theproposed Hissar-e-Shahi (Jalalabad) industrialpark site:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0    Technical assistance to help build capacity in the AISA to implement industrial park projects and&#13;
     develop apolicy, regulatory and institutionalframework for industrialpark development.&#13;
&#13;
It has been agreed with the Government o f Afghanistan that IDA will consider providing an additional&#13;
grant to fund the construction o f the proposed 135 hectare industrial park at Kamari after there i s&#13;
satisfactory progress with the implementation o f the Hissar-e-Shahi industrialpark and adequate capacity&#13;
i s built in AISA to develop and manage both parks. The proposed support to industrial parks will&#13;
complement the efforts o f USAID, which i s providing support to the development o f industrial parks on&#13;
a limited scale.&#13;
&#13;
Infrastructural investment in the Hissar-e-Shahi industrialpark ($21.1million). The project will support&#13;
the development o f the Hissar-e-Shahi industrial park. The total area to be developed i s 106 hectares, o f&#13;
which roughly 65% will be industrial plot area (the rest being taken up by roads and common facilities).&#13;
There i s scope for expanding the Hissar-e-Shahi Park in the future. However, this expansion will not be&#13;
funded by this project.      The park i s expected to house industrial units in the following sectors: food&#13;
processing, light engineering, leather garments, and carpet cutting and washing.&#13;
&#13;
The project will fund infrastructural investments such as land leveling and grading, road network, water&#13;
supply and fire-fighting system, waste water collection and treatment system, storm water drainage&#13;
system, solid waste collection and disposal system, environmental laboratory, and street lighting.4In&#13;
addition, provision has been kept for diesel generators with a total capacity o f 12 MW, and electricity&#13;
distribution lines within the park. This entire generating capacity may not be required if the power&#13;
transmission line linking Kabul to UzbekistadTajikistan i s commissioned by mid-2010 and power&#13;
currently diverted to Kabul i s made available to the Jalalabad area, including the industrial park, In that&#13;
case, some o f the generators may be used as a stand-by facility.&#13;
&#13;
The 135 hectare Kamari Park, which could later be considered for funding through an additional grant,&#13;
i s estimated to cost $32.0 million. Inaddition to the basic physical infrastructure which would be similar&#13;
to that for the Hissar-e-Shahi park, this figure includes the cost o f water supply to the Park from the&#13;
Logar well field ,and the costs o f connecting the Park to the main power transmission line (including the&#13;
cost o f the electricity distribution line and a sub-station to allow step-down o f electricity from the high&#13;
voltage transmission line to the low-voltage distribution line). The transmission line to bring power to&#13;
Kabul from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan i s expected to be completed by the time the industrial park i s&#13;
operational (i.e., mid 2010) and the Park i s expected to be connected to this transmission line. However,&#13;
provision has been kept for installing six generators o f 1.2 MW capacity each to meet the needs o f&#13;
industrial units should there be a delay inthe commissioning o f the transmission line for import o f power&#13;
from Central Asia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The cost figure of $21.1million includes provisionfor contingency, equal to 15% o f estimatedcost, as well as&#13;
provision for tax payments, equivalent to 8% o f cost.&#13;
&#13;
                                                        15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
AISA i s currently in discussion with the Ministry o f Energy and Water on whether Ministry would&#13;
assume responsibility for drilling o f well and highpoint surface reservoir for the Kamari area&#13;
including the park, and the Electrical Sub-station at Kamari. If the costs o f these investments are&#13;
borne by the Ministry, the residual cost for constructing the Kamari Park will be $23.3 million.&#13;
A I S A also feels that a provision for four generators, rather than six, i s adequate. Inthat case, the cost&#13;
will drop to $21.8 million.&#13;
&#13;
Although the project will fund only the Hissar-e-Shahi Park unless additional funds are made available&#13;
later, the design work for the project has laid the ground work for both parks; this includes economic&#13;
analysis, environmental and social assessments, and engineering design for the parks. In addition, the&#13;
technical assistance to be provided through this project (see below) will help buildadequate capacity in&#13;
AISA's Industrial Parks Development Department to handle the development and operation o f both&#13;
parks.&#13;
&#13;
ii) Institutional support to AISA in the area of industrial park development ($2.9 million)'.          AISA has&#13;
recently appointed a Director for the IndustrialParks Development Department (AISA-IPD). It also has a&#13;
small number o f staff with experience in engineering design and construction. However, its capacity i s&#13;
limited and insufficient to deal with the challenges o f building additional parks in addition to managing&#13;
the USAID-funded park in Bagrami. This component will help address this deficiency by helping to&#13;
build capacity in the areas of project management, financial management, procurement, and&#13;
environmental management. An implementation supervision consultant will be hired for 30 months to&#13;
help AISA supervise the work of the contractors. Other internationalh-egional experts to be hired will&#13;
include a procurement specialist, a financial management specialist and an environmental specialist, each&#13;
to be hired for a period o f 18-24 months. Local experts will also be funded through the project in the&#13;
same areas and also in social management. One o f the important tasks o f the external experts will be to&#13;
train the local experts who will implement the procurement, financial management, environmental and&#13;
social management systems that they will also be responsible for setting up. While these capacities will&#13;
help implement the industrial park to be supported by this project, their benefits will spill over to other,&#13;
future, projects o f AISA. This component will also fund environmental and social assessments that will&#13;
be required inconnection with project investments to be identified inthe future, such as the land fill site.&#13;
&#13;
Inaddition, short term experts will be funded to provide inputsrelated to the broader mandate ofoverall&#13;
industrial park development in the country. The topic areas will be identified by AISA in the future but&#13;
may include developing a strategic vision for an industrial park development program, laws and&#13;
regulations to encourage private sector participation in industrial parks, defining the optimal role o f&#13;
AISA and other' GOAentities in industrial park development, regulation, promotion, and management,&#13;
and clarifying the responsibilities o fnational, provincial and local authorities regarding industrial parks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Component2: Institutionaldevelopmentfor PSD (USSl .OO million)&#13;
&#13;
This component will support institutional development and capacity building in the public sector and&#13;
through public-private partnerships to strengthen the legal, policy, regulatory and institutional framework&#13;
for private sector development. This will be in addition to the capacity building in AISA's Industrial&#13;
Parks Development Department described above. The design o f this component will be guided by the&#13;
Government's PI2R exercise at the M o C I and AISA's organizational restructuring plans and i s intended&#13;
to support these initiatives. It will take into account the experience with recent technical assistance&#13;
programs o f various donors. In particular, it will address government concerns about the cost-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'This includes $0.95 million allocated from the Project Preparation Fund.The bulk of these finds have been used&#13;
for carrying out the environmental and social impact assessment.&#13;
&#13;
                                                        16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
effectiveness o f previous capacity building programs and the need to build long-standing indigenous&#13;
capacity.&#13;
&#13;
This component will support institutional development and capacity buildingingovernment through two&#13;
windows:&#13;
&#13;
     i)AISA-investmentpromotion,facilitationandpolicyresearch($0.50million)&#13;
     ii)MinistryofCommerce($0.50million)&#13;
&#13;
The detailed design o f the component takes into account the support being provided by other donors in&#13;
this area (GTZ inAISA, and DfID,USAID and GTZ inthe MoC). Itwill leverage the presence ofDfID,&#13;
GTZ and USAIDfunded advisors inthese agencies.&#13;
&#13;
i) Institutional support to AISA in the areas of investment promotion and facilitation, and policy&#13;
research. The institutional support to AISA will entail capacity buildingand advisory assistance to help&#13;
implement AISA's organizational restructuringplan developed inAugust 2006, buildingupon a business&#13;
plan developed earlier with MIGA assistance in December 2004. It will complement GTZ's technical&#13;
assistance program inAISA. A long-advisor, funded by the German Government, i s currently supporting&#13;
AISA in the area o f investment promotion. In addition, GTZ i s providing some funding for institution&#13;
building activities but its budget is limited. This project will help fill the gap. The technical assistance&#13;
programwill cover investment promotion and facilitation, and associated analytic and advocacy work.&#13;
&#13;
AISA was designed to be a one-stop shop for investors in Afghanistan, providing information, guiding&#13;
the investor through all government interactions, and eliminating, where possible, bureaucratic delays&#13;
and red tape. The Agency was intended to be the investor's primary partner throughout the investment&#13;
process.    Ithas achieved a great deal since it was established and began operations inAugust 2003. It&#13;
has hired staff, established an office, and moved forward with its first work program: establishing and&#13;
implementing procedures for business licensing and registration. Throughout this period, the Agency&#13;
received funding from the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development o f the&#13;
Government o f Germany and technical assistance from GTZ. The business registration program i s now&#13;
functioning well with Afghanistan now ranking close to international good practice in registering&#13;
businesses. AISA has also initiated some investment promotion activities and have developed capacity in&#13;
organizing events such as road shows. AISA's promotional and licensing services are reasonably well&#13;
developed although there i s considerable scope for improvement. In comparison, although important&#13;
beginnings have been made, AISA's investor facilitation function remains underdeveloped. AISA staff&#13;
have been helping investors on a selective basis to navigate the regulatory maze in other government&#13;
agencies and acquire the clearances and permits needed to start a business. It also has weak capacity in&#13;
research and analysis to underpin its promotional, facilitation and policy advocacy role. Here, also, a&#13;
beginning has been made through the recent establishment o f a Policy and Research Department but this&#13;
needs substantial capacity building.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
AISA wants to develop its Investor Support Department, and Policy and Research Department. The&#13;
Investor Support Department will provide specialized individual client services for domestic and foreign&#13;
investors duringthe pre and post investment phases. This will include: a) provision o f initial information&#13;
and advice in areas such as market intelligence, legal framework, customs and taxation, and availability&#13;
o f key inputs;b) facilitating support from other government agencies or private bodies; and c) facilitating&#13;
interaction with other government regulatory agencies. This support will be provided in both the pre and&#13;
post-investment phases. The Department will have staff with both sector and thematic (such as legal,&#13;
finance, risk management) expertise.        Currently, AISA has inadequate knowledge o f investments&#13;
actually realized. A revamped Investor Support Department will monitor and document the progress in&#13;
implementing investments that have been approved by AISA and systematically document the feedback&#13;
&#13;
                                                    17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
from investors on their experience in implementingprojects. This feedback will be used by the Policy&#13;
and Research Department to identify patterns and recurrent bottlenecks, and will inform AISA's policy&#13;
advocacy functions. AISA's effectiveness in these areas will be measured by the decrease in the time&#13;
taken and cost incurred to start a business (going beyond simplyregistering).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
AISA's current capacity to produce analytic papers on policy issues, fact sheets on market and sectoral&#13;
information i s weak with much o f the work being done by AISA's CEOPresident himself with&#13;
assistance fkom one international staff. Limited resources are devoted to these tasks. AISA intends to&#13;
develop its Policy and Research Department as a specialized unit to effectively carry out the analytic,&#13;
monitoring and advocacy functions inclose collaborationwith the other technical departments.&#13;
&#13;
The project will fund practical assistance to AISA staff so that they can undertake both policy analysis&#13;
and long-term planning, and hands on assistance to investors. Specific services/activities to be funded&#13;
will include:&#13;
&#13;
                a long-term advisor for the Policy and ResearchDepartment (for one year)&#13;
                a small number o f short-term experts;&#13;
                short-term and long-termtraining programs, and study tours for AISA staff;&#13;
                funds for research, analysis and monitoring and;&#13;
                small amounts o f equipment.&#13;
&#13;
AISA suggested that short-term expertise will be useful if carefully planned. It was agreed with AISA&#13;
and GTZ that the GTZ advisor will help AISA inthis planning and ensure that the recommendations are&#13;
followed up and implemented after the experts have left. Examples o f areas where short-term expertise&#13;
could be useful include the production o f sector and thematic reports, database development and&#13;
development o f a monitoring system.&#13;
&#13;
ii) Institutional support to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The PRR Stage 1 application for the&#13;
M o C was approved in August 2005 followed by approval o f the PRR Stage 2 application in June 2006.&#13;
The restructuring in the Ministry has led to the creation o f a number o f directorates. In addition to the&#13;
functional directorates dealing with human resources, finance, administration, and research and planning,&#13;
there are four thematic directorates dealing with a) InternationalTrade, b) Transit and Trade Facilitation,&#13;
c) Private Sector Development, and d) State-owned Enterprises. This component will support capacity&#13;
buildingprimarily inthe PSD Directorate (see Box for a description o f the Directorate's mandate). The&#13;
Directorate will be headed by a Director, assisted by four Deputy Directors. Inaddition, it i s expected to&#13;
have about 15 officers and an equal number o f junior staff. Positions for the Director and Deputy&#13;
Director were advertised recently and appointments are expected soon. The positions will be advertised&#13;
soon and the newly appointed Director and Deputy Directors will have a role in the selection process. It&#13;
i s expected that most, if not all, staff inthe PSD Directorate will be inplace by March 2007.&#13;
&#13;
The objective o f the capacity building program i s to develop the policy formulation, implementation and&#13;
evaluation skills and knowledge appropriate to each level o f personnel in the newly formed PSDD. The&#13;
capacity building program will also allow staff to develop the general managerial and administrative&#13;
s h l l s necessary for the efficient functioning o f the directorate.&#13;
&#13;
DfJD funded advisors have been working with the MoCI to assess capacity building needs in the&#13;
Ministry, especially in the PSD Directorate. A preliminary needs assessment has been carried out for&#13;
M o C I staff, includingthose in regional offices and in associated agencies. This has highlighted the need&#13;
for training in the following areas: a) Basic skills such as language, computer skills and management&#13;
skills; and, b) Technical skills, including policy formulation, research and analysis, project management,&#13;
report writing and financial management, and c) business and PSD concepts and terminology. The&#13;
project will provide support in all areas. Examples o f topical areas to be covered by the training include,&#13;
&#13;
                                                          18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
but is not limited to, investment-related legal and regulatory framework, investment incentives, business&#13;
development services principles, value chain analysis, small business development, stake-holder&#13;
analysis, strategic communications and public-private dialogue.&#13;
&#13;
The DFID-fundedadvisory team in the MOCI, in collaboration with MOCI staff, i s in the process o f&#13;
developing the structure and content o f the training modules. Senior staff inthe M O C I as well as Afghan&#13;
staff in the advisory team will be involved so that future training programs can be developed without&#13;
much external assistance. The sequencing o f the capacity building program i s designed to lead new&#13;
recruits through a logical progression o f professional development; starting with induction program, then&#13;
moving first to cross-cutting professional skills and knowledge and secondly to department specific&#13;
professional slulls and knowledge. Managerial and administrative skills and knowledge will be&#13;
developed throughout the period o f the capacity buildingprogram, focusing on essential skills at first6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Ministry of Commerce and Industry: Private Sector Development Directorate&#13;
&#13;
The PSD Directorate with consist o f three departments: a) the Investment Policy Department; b) the Market and&#13;
Business Development Policy; and c) PSD Outreach Department.&#13;
&#13;
The Investment Policy Department's mandate is to help create an institutional, legislative and regulatory&#13;
environment that encourages investment; work to reduce the regulatory burden on the private sector while at the&#13;
same time achieving the goals o f these regulations; work within the M o C and with other Ministries to promote&#13;
institutional reform so as to enhance the government-private sector interface; and coordinate with AISA to provide&#13;
information to the private sector to facilitate productive investment.&#13;
&#13;
The Market and Business Development Policy Department will complement the work o f the Investment Policy&#13;
Department on broader enabling environment issues by facilitating the development o f market systems and&#13;
encouraging the formalization o f Afghan businesses. Its mandate includes the development o f policies that promote&#13;
fair and equal access to well-hnctioning domestic and international markets for all market participants;&#13;
demonstrate opportunities for productive investment by analyzing value chains, identifying and removing obstacles&#13;
to value creation; identify incentives and disincentives to formalization and developing a package o f measures to&#13;
encourage greater formalization o f the Afghan economy; improve access by Afghan firms to public contracts;&#13;
facilitate the development by Afghan businesses o f skills and knowledge needed to compete effectively; and&#13;
encourage the creation o f a sustainable private sector market for business development services.&#13;
&#13;
The objective o f the PSD Outreach Department i s to promote effective dialogue between the M o C and other PSD&#13;
stakeholders and seek to develop a "shared stakeholder vision" on the role o f government in a free market&#13;
economy.      Using communication channels effectively and adopting a systematic approach to dialogue, the&#13;
department will help develop a wider public understanding o f the role o f the private sector and the benefits that can&#13;
flow from economic growth based on private sector-led development; provide the PSDD and M o C with a better&#13;
understanding o f the views and priorities o f the private sector and strengthen the quality o f its policy and law&#13;
making based on private ,sector input; disseminate information on PSD policy and reform programs, including&#13;
policy and legislative initiatives; and facilitate more effective implementation o f PSD-related mandates o f other&#13;
Ministries.&#13;
&#13;
Modalities o f support will include training programs, workshops, study tours and attendance in short-&#13;
term courses.      Formal training will be delivered by Afghan trainers drawn from the PSDD using&#13;
materials prepared by and with the support o f international advisers. A considerable amount o f training&#13;
will be provided in Dari. The formal training program will be carefully structured to give staff rapid&#13;
access to learning related to essential professional, managerial and administrative skills, so the&#13;
concentration o f formal training in the early months o f the program will be higher than later on, when&#13;
other methods will be used more extensively. Formal training sessions will be planned and timetabled in&#13;

advance and a learning culture will be encouraged within the PSDD so that staff are motivated to attend&#13;
sessions. Staff will receive a certificate o f satisfactory completion if they attend a certain number o f days&#13;
o f training and demonstrate that they have acquired a satisfactory level o f understanding. Seminars and&#13;
workshops will be held to develop capacity in response to the workload o f the directorate, addressing&#13;
specific needs as they arise.&#13;
&#13;
Study tours will be designed to expose PSDD staff to international best practice in their respective fields.&#13;
They will also be used as an incentive to staff to take maximum advantage o f other capacity building&#13;
opportunities provided under this program, by requiring staff members to have a certificate o f&#13;
satisfactory completion for other elements before they can be eligible to participate in such study tours.&#13;
Prior to going on a study tour, staff members will be prepared through their department specific training&#13;
program and seminars and workshops to ensure that they are able to take full advantage o f the&#13;
opportunity. There will also be a review mechanism to consolidate learning from study tours after staff&#13;
return to Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
The `Train the Trainer' approach will be used extensively throughout this program. All directorate staff&#13;
will at various times be encouraged to participate inthe planning and delivery o f training. Staff who will&#13;
demonstrate a particular aptitude will be trained to improve their presentation and training skills.&#13;
However, the primary focus will be to train the Director to deliver relevant aspects o f training courses to&#13;
Heads o f Departments and for Head o f Departments to become skilled at delivering training to Officers&#13;
and other staff intheir Department.&#13;
&#13;
The effectiveness o f the capacity building program in the Ministry o f Commerce and Industry will be&#13;
assessed both in terms o f its impact on policy formulation (as measured by private sector perceptions o f&#13;
the predictability o f PSD related policy) and on staff capacities to be assessed on several dimensions.&#13;

                        AFGHANISTAN: PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT             PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The project will be under the oversight o f the High Commission for Investment, which will receive&#13;
periodic reports on implementation progress. AISA, the Secretariat o f the High Commission for&#13;
Investment, which i s chaired by the Minister for Commerce and Industry, will be responsible for&#13;
implementation o f main components of the project. M o C I will directly implement a small technical&#13;
assistance component.&#13;
&#13;
A.       AfghanistanInvestment SupportAgency&#13;
&#13;
AISA was established in 2003 as an independent institution and has its own organizational structure. It i s&#13;
headed by a President, who i s also the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) o f the Agency. It has two distinct&#13;
functions and accordingly the organizational and staffing set up are in place. AISA's core function i s&#13;
domestic and foreign investment promotion and facilitation. This comprises registration o f business to&#13;
provide a legal identity, facilitation for obtaining other approvals required to set up or operate a business&#13;
and investment promotional work within and outside the country, e.g., organization o f business&#13;
workshop and trade fairs or road shows. These activities are carried out by the Investment Promotion,&#13;
Investment Support and Licensing Departments. Inaddition, AISA has recently established a Policy and&#13;
Research Department to carry out analytic and monitoring work, and policy advocacy. The other main&#13;
function o f AISA i s the development and operation o f a select number o f industrial parks. This function&#13;
i s carried out by its Industrial Parks Development Department (AISA-IPD) and was originally assigned&#13;
to AISA to facilitate the construction o f three USAID-funded industrial parks in Bagrami (near Kabul),&#13;
Mazar-e-Sharif and Kandahar. Under the USAID project, some capacity was created in AISA-IPD to&#13;
support the construction o f three parks. However, this capacity was mainly to complement the work o f&#13;
the USAID construction contractors. Inaddition to these five departments, AISA has an Administrative&#13;
Department that deals with finance and accounting, procurement, contracting and maintenance, and&#13;
personnel administrationand human resource development.&#13;
&#13;
Although AISA will have the overall responsibility to implement the project, its Industrial Parks&#13;
Development Department will be responsible for the construction and operation o f the parks, and&#13;
implementation o f its own technical assistance component. The other departments inAISA, inparticular&#13;
the Investor Support Department and the Policy and ResearchDepartments, will implement the technical&#13;
assistance component for enhancing AISA's investor facilitation capacity, and policy and research&#13;
capacity. AISA has some in-house capacity to implement its technical assistance component, since it i s&#13;
already involved in hiring consultants, arranging training and study tour, procuring office equipments&#13;
and vehicles and also organizing various promotional activities ininvestment promotional work.&#13;
&#13;
The Industrial Park Development Department's role will be as follows: (i)      manage the consultant which&#13;
i s undertaking the environmental and social assessments and design work; (ii) the design work,&#13;
                                                                                     using&#13;
prepare bid documents for the industrial parks, invite and evaluate bids, and award contracts; (iii)     hire&#13;
implementation supervision consultants to supervise the construction contractors for ensuring quality;&#13;
(iv) monitor the work' of the implementation consultants by supervising the progress in terms o f&#13;
specification, quality and actual progress o f the work; (v) implement the environmental and social&#13;
management plans; (vi) procure consultants, equipment and other services for implementing the&#13;
industrial park related technical assistance component; (vii) supervise the consultants' work, and design&#13;
and implement training program and study tours; (viii) prepare disbursement application for payments to&#13;
consultants, vendors and other purchases; and (ix) manage the financial records for all AISA-IPD&#13;
activities and prepare accounts for standard financial reporting and management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Current management structure and staffing in Industrial Park Department. AISA-IPD lacks capacity&#13;
and will require significant capacity buildingfor efficient implementation o f the project. The President o f&#13;
AISA has the overall management responsibility for industrial park development assisted by the Director&#13;
o f the Industrial Parks Development Department. The Director will be the key contact point for the&#13;
World Bank, MoF, MoCI, National Environment Protection Authority (NEPA), contractors and&#13;
consultants and other ministries, agencies or entities related to the project. Current AISA staffing i s as&#13;
follows: (a) Director (one), b) Deputy Director (one-currently vacant), c) Planning and Maintenance&#13;
Engineer (one), who i s responsible for overall design and implementation work; (d) Site Engineer (two),&#13;
who are responsible for site inspection to ensure the work progress according to implementation, quality&#13;
and target progress; and (e) Administration Office (one) responsible for overall office procurement and&#13;
accounts keeping in conjunction with AISA's Administration and Financial Department. In addition,&#13;
there i s a small number o f technicians and guards.&#13;
&#13;
Additional staffing required. The current AISA-IPD staffing and skill compositions are not adequate to&#13;
undertake the overall implementation o f the industrial park construction and technical assistance&#13;
implementation. The Department requires significant capacity enhancement in: (i)      project management;&#13;
(ii) procurement; (iii)financial management and disbursement; and (iv) environmental management (see&#13;
table below). The project will fund the expatriate positions for the duration mentioned in the table and&#13;
the local positions (except support staff positions which will not be funded) for the first two years, after&#13;
which they will be absorbed into AISA's payroll. AISA should also fill as soon as possible the Deputy&#13;
Director position.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Supervision Consultant. AISA will need to hire an Implementation Supervision&#13;
Consultant in order to ensure timely and quality implementation o f the industrial parks. Use o f&#13;
implementation supervision consultants i s a standard practice widely used under donor financed&#13;
construction projects. It i s not necessary to build such capacity on a permanent basis within AISA as.the&#13;
need for implementation supervision i s project specific. However, AISA should have internal capacity to&#13;
supervise and monitor the work o f the implementation supervision consultant. The Consultant will be&#13;
needed for 30 months to ensure efficient project management and quality o f work according to design&#13;
specifications. The Consultant will work with the Planning and Maintenance Engineer report to the&#13;
Director o f the Department. AISA will follow a competitive procurement process for this as well as the&#13;
other consultant positions listed inTable A6.1.&#13;
&#13;
                                                      25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The specific tasks o f the Implementation Supervision Consultant will include but not limited to the&#13;
following: a) prepare construction schedules for the park in consultation with the construction&#13;
contractors; b) ensure that work i s done according to the engineering design and on time, and o f specified&#13;
quality; c) check bills submitted by contractors and verify that bills match the work specifications; d)&#13;
certify bills for payment; and s) prepare reports on implementation progress.&#13;
&#13;
Industrial park management. The industrial park will be managed by AISA's Industrial Park&#13;
Development Department for the first three years o f its operation. After this, AISA will use its best&#13;
efforts to transfer the maintenance functions o f the industrial park to private management. An Investors&#13;
Association will be formed comprising o f the park tenants within the first two years o f operation after a&#13;
critical mass o f tenants have moved in. An MOU will be signed between AISA and Investors&#13;
Association spelling out the rights and responsibilities o f either party. A management contract will be&#13;
signed between the Investor Association and the private management contractor spelling out the&#13;
responsibilities o f the contractor, fee structures and penalties for non-compliance. The contract will also&#13;
spell out the role o f other supervisory and regulatory bodies such as AISA and the National&#13;
Environmental Protection Agency in overseeing the work o f the management contractors. A similar&#13;
model i s contemplated for the Bagrami IndustrialPark, which began operations earlier this year. Lessons&#13;
from this experience will be taken into account in designing the private management model for the&#13;
Hissar-e-Shahi park to be supported by this project.&#13;
&#13;
Pricing and allocation of plots. Prior to the allocation o f the plots, AISA shall prepare and agree with&#13;
the World Bank the following: a) the mode o f plot transfer, i.e., whether sales, leases or both; b) the&#13;
pricing mechanism, i.e., the price or rent to be charged if these are to be fixed in advance or, if the price&#13;
i s to be determined through market forces, b) the payment scheduling, i.e., amount o f down payment and&#13;
number and frequency o f installment payments; c) the method o f amving at the price, such as an auction,&#13;
including the reservation price; d) the criteria for allocating plots, including the size o f plots, and the&#13;
mechanism to apply the criteria, such as the nature and composition o f the evaluation committee. These&#13;
modalities will have to be such as to ensure transparency, efficiency and fairness in the pricing and&#13;
allocation decisions. Tenants will be fully informed about their responsibilities, and will have to commit&#13;
in writing to meeting these, before plots are handed over. These will include environmental and social&#13;
management responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
Land transfer. AISA has provided the World Bank copies o f documentation certifying transfer o f landto&#13;
AISA from the Ministry o f Agriculture for the Hissar-e-Shahi Park. Similar documentation will need to&#13;
be provided inthe future ifthe Kamari Park i s considered for funding through an additional grant.&#13;
&#13;
During Negotiation, it was agreed with Government that AISA shall appoint the specialists for&#13;
procurement and financial management and prepare a financial management manual before&#13;
disbursement. It was further agreed that:&#13;
&#13;

CountryIssues&#13;
&#13;
The Bank has gained substantial experience and understanding o f the financial management environment&#13;
inAfghanistanthrough the large number ofprojects under implementationover the past four years. The&#13;
Public Administration Capacity Building Project (PACBP), i s the primary instrument to continue and&#13;
enhance the fiduciary measures put in place during the past years to build transparency and&#13;
accountability for the fundingprovided by the Bank and other donors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A PFM performance rating system that was developed by the Public Expenditure and Financial&#13;
Accountability (PEFA) multi-agency partnership program, including the World Bank, using 28 high-&#13;
level indicators was applied in Afghanistan in June 2005. The system i s structured around six core&#13;
dimensions o f PFMperformance: budget credibility; comprehensiveness and transparency; policy-based&#13;
budgeting; predictability and control in budget execution; accounting, recording, and reporting; and&#13;
external scrutiny and audit.&#13;
&#13;
Afghanistan's ratings against the P F M performance indicators generally portray a public sector where&#13;
financial resources are, by and large, being used for their intended purposes. This has been accomplished&#13;
with very highlevels of support from international firms; this assistance will continue to be needed over&#13;
the medium term ifthese ratings are to be maintained. There i s also muchroom for improvement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In spite of the undeniable gains made in reconstruction since the end o f 2001, the challenges facing&#13;
Afghanistan remain immense, not least because o f the tenuous security situation in the region and&#13;
continuedprevalence o f a large illegal and illicit economy. The policy framework benchmarks have not&#13;
yet been fully costed so various priorities are funded through the annual budgeting process. The rising&#13;
costs o f the security sector constitute the major constraint on attainment o f fiscal sustainability. With&#13;
regard to executive oversight, the national assembly will play an increasingly active role. All in all, the&#13;
new national strategy has created high expectations o f the executive which could prove to be quite&#13;
difficult to meet.&#13;
&#13;
The public sector, in spite o f considerable efforts to reform its core functions, remains extremely weak&#13;
outside o f Kabul. The lack o f qualified staff inthe civil service and the absence o f qualified counterparts&#13;
inthe government after 30 years ofwar and conflicts is abindingconstraint. Delaysinreforming the pay&#13;
structure and grading o f civil servants have severely crippled the public administration o f the country.&#13;
Domestic revenues lag behind expenditures by a factor o f ten to one. Large-scale corruption could&#13;
emerge to undermine the government's efforts to enhance aid flows through national accounts.&#13;
Capacities to track expenditures and monitor expenditure outcomes have improved, but they need rapid&#13;
and substantial strengthening if progress toward the attainment o f national development targets i s to be&#13;
monitored. Currently, 75% o f external revenues bypass government appropriationsystems.&#13;
&#13;
To help mitigate these risks, the World Bank i s financing a Financial Management Advisor to assist the&#13;
MinistryofFinance, an Audit Advisor to assist the Control and Audit Office, and a ProcurementAdvisor&#13;
to assist in Procurement-related activities. An Internal Audit Function i s also being developed with&#13;
World Bank financing. USAID, continuing support based upon the earlier Indian Aid Assistance&#13;
Program, i s financing a team o f consultants and advisors to assist the D a Afghanistan Bank in local as&#13;
well as foreign currency operations. The activities carried out under the existing Public Administration&#13;
Projects have helped the Government to ensure that appropriate fiduciary standards are maintained for&#13;
public expenditures, including those supported by the Bank and the donor community. PACBP i s&#13;

                                                     28&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
helping to ensure that fiduciary standards are further enhanced and that capacity i s developed in the&#13;
Government to maintain these standards. The country systems which are in place for externally-aided&#13;
projects will be used for all financial management matters of the project.&#13;

Strengths&#13;
&#13;
The Government provides assurance to the Bank and other donors that the measures in place to ensure&#13;
appropriate utilization o f funds will not be circumvented. The Government support for PACBP i s a&#13;
strength in itself, strengthening as it does the financial management inTreasury operations, public sector&#13;
procurement, internal audit, and external audit in the Auditor General's office. AISA has demonstrated&#13;
adequate FM capacity by preparing its first annual financial statements which have successfully&#13;
undergone an external audit by KPMG, the entity audit firm. AISA i s also the recipient o f a Project&#13;
Preparation Facility for which they were able to meet all FMrequirements, thus their experience inBank&#13;
implemented project i s also a strength. AISA currently uses QuickBooks for accounting and reporting&#13;
which i s adequate for this project.&#13;
&#13;
Weaknessesand Action Plan&#13;
&#13;
The main weakness in this project, as in many others in Afghanistan, is the ability to attract suitably&#13;
qualified and experienced counterpart staff especially for financial management.        AISA presently has&#13;
capacity to handle its current FM responsibilities but AISA's staff and systems are not geared up for&#13;
effectively managing foreign grants and dealing with donor agencies. To strengthen the FM capacity o f&#13;
&#13;
                                                       30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
AISA to implement this project, the proposed measures include:             i)engagement of a Financial&#13;
Management Specialist to be appointed in the Finance Department o f AISA, ii)recruitment o f a&#13;
dedicated Accounts Officer for Industrial Park Development as the government counterpart to the FMS&#13;
who will coordinate between the Finance department o f AISA and MOF, and iii)appointment o f a head&#13;
o f Industrial Park Development (the last action has been completeted). Also to address this weakness&#13;
and help improve capacity, it i s important to involve AISA staff in this project at multiple levels.&#13;
Together with the intensive training programs included in this project, these actions are expected to&#13;
enable AISA to handle increasedFMresponsibilities o f donor projects inthe future.&#13;

&#13;
AISA i s the lead implementing agency for this Project.         There i s on-going Bank Group technical&#13;
assistance to AISA under the Investment Guarantee Facility Project. AISA has been able to manage this&#13;
well and thus has relative experience in the implementation o f Bank projects. The project will be under&#13;
the oversight of the MoC. AISA, the Secretariat o f the High Commission for Investment, which is&#13;
chaired by the Minister for Commerce, will be responsible for implementation o f the main components&#13;
o f the project. AISA was established in2003 as an independent institution and has its own organizational&#13;
structure. It i s headed by a President, who i s also the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) o f the Agency. It&#13;
has two distinct functions and accordingly the organizational and staffing set up are in place. AISA's&#13;
core function i s domestic and foreign investment promotion. AISA will require significant capacity&#13;
buildingfor efficient implementation o fthe project.&#13;

The FMS, along with the counterpart in AISA's Finance Department and the Director o f the Industrial&#13;
Parks Department, will be responsible for ensuring that the project expenditures forecast to be expended&#13;
in a fiscal year are captured inthe Governmental Development budget of that fiscal year. The project&#13;
will be includedinthe budget decree or AISA must obtain an approval from the Presidential Office to be&#13;
attached to D1forms at the time o f requesting yearly allotments for contracts under development project&#13;
to avoid delays when payments are processed.&#13;
&#13;
Fundsflow&#13;
&#13;
The standard mechanism of flow of funds in Afghanistan will be followed in this project. Project funds&#13;
will be deposited in the Designated Account (DA) to be opened and maintained at the Da Afghanistan&#13;
Bank (DaB) or in a local commercial bank, if approved. The DA, in keeping with current practices for&#13;
other projects in Afghanistan, will be operated by the Special Disbursement Unit (SDU) in the Treasury&#13;
&#13;

AISA i s presently beingrun on an autonomous basis with its own revenues and expenses without any&#13;
direct budgetary support from the Government. It has successfully prepared its First Annual Financial&#13;
Statement and has got it audited from KPMG. The financial statements and the audit opinion have been&#13;
reviewed and are of acceptable standards. AISA follows its own Chart o f Accounts with financial data on&#13;
QuickBooks.&#13;
&#13;
The project will follow AISA financial management policies and procedures. These have been reviewed&#13;
and are o f acceptable international standards. It will use the Chart o f Accounts which has been developed&#13;
for previous projects and which will be upgraded to capture the desired heads of financial information&#13;
under components and categories so as to meet the reporting requirements o f the project and&#13;
Government. A financial management manual shall be prepared by AISA to document its financial&#13;
management arrangements; this will be approved by the Bank before disbursement.&#13;
&#13;
AISA's Finance Department will be responsible for coordination with the MOF including obtaining&#13;
disbursement and Designated Account bank statements monthly and reconciling these statements to&#13;
records maintained for the project at AISA. It will also prepare monthly and quarterly reports. As a&#13;

Annual financial statements will be prepared in AISA detailing activities pertaining to the projects as&#13;
separate line items with adequate details to reflect the component and category wise details. These&#13;
financial statements would be reconciled to the one prepared by SDU for Government and External&#13;
Audit purposes.&#13;
&#13;
Project accounts will also be consolidated centrally in the Ministry o f Finance, through the Special&#13;
Disbursement Unit in the Treasury supported by the financial management agent. Consolidated Project&#13;
Financial Statements will be prepared for all sources and uses o f project funds.&#13;
&#13;
Internal control and audit&#13;
&#13;
AISA will upgrade its own chart o f accounts which, along with its internal controls, have been reviewed&#13;
and deemed acceptable by an external audit firm. The project will follow AISA's customary financial&#13;
management policies and procedures and controls. These have been reviewed and are of acceptable&#13;
international standards.&#13;
&#13;
The project financial management systems will be subject to review by the newly established internal&#13;
audit directorate o f the MoF, according to risk-based work programs to be determined by the Director o f&#13;
Internal Audit. As the size and volume o f transactions increases in AISA it will be encouraged to have&#13;
its own internal audit arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
External audit&#13;
&#13;
The accounts of the project will be audited by the Auditor General, with the support o f the Audit Agent,&#13;
with terms o f reference satisfactory to the Association. The audit o f the project accounts will include an&#13;
assessment o f the : (a) adequacy o f the accounting and internal control systems; (b) ability to maintain&#13;
&#13;
                                                      33&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
adequate documentation for transactions; and (c) eligibility o f incurred expenditures for Association&#13;
financing. The audited annual project financial statements will be submitted within six months o f the&#13;
close o f the fiscal year. All agencies involved in implementation and holding records o f expenditures&#13;
would need to retainthese records as per the IDA retention policy.&#13;

months o f the end o f the fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
Reporting and monitoring&#13;
&#13;
Financial Statements and Project Reports will be used for project monitoring and supervision. Based on&#13;
the FM arrangements o f this project, Financial Statements and Project Reports will be prepared in the&#13;
Finance Department o f the AISA. These reports will be produced based on records kept on Quickbooks&#13;
and Excel spread sheets after due reconciliation to expenditure statements from SDU (as recorded in the&#13;
Afghanistan Financial Management Information System- AFMIS) and bank statements from DAB. The&#13;
FMS along with counterpart staff will be responsible for this function.&#13;

Financing Percentage.      In line with the current Country Financing Parameters, the disbursement&#13;
percentage has been set at 100%. The Government has recently enacted the Income Tax Law o f 2005&#13;
and has also issued a finance circular to articulate the Ministry o f Finance policy with respect to the&#13;
application o f law. Provisions inthis circular must be reflected in all contracts under this project, where&#13;
applicable.&#13;

Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs).        Because Afghanistan i s a high-risk environment and&#13;
Government's and AISA's ability to maintain and manage documentation related to SOEs has not been&#13;
thoroughly demonstrated, most expenditures will require submission o f transaction records. For all&#13;
expenditures on contracts exceeding USS20,OOO records are required. For expenditures on contracts less&#13;
than US$ 20,000 supporting documentation in the form o f a detailed Statement o f Expenditure i s&#13;
acceptable.&#13;
&#13;
Designated Account. A Designated Account (DA) will be opened and maintained in D a Afghanistan&#13;
Bank (or a commercial bank, if so agreed with the Ministry o f Finance)           on terms and conditions&#13;
acceptable to the Association; and, if so agreed with the Ministryo f Finance) and would be operated by&#13;
AISA in accordance with the Association's operational policies.&#13;
&#13;
The Authorized Allocation o f the Designated Account would be set not to exceed US$ 500,000.&#13;
Applications for reimbursement o f the Designated Account will be submitted monthly, regardless o f&#13;
amount.&#13;
&#13;
Minimum application size.        The minimum application size for withdrawal applications for&#13;

&#13;
Authority to withdraw Gruntfunds. AISA may receive Ministryo f Finance approval to sign and submit&#13;
withdrawal applications to the Association. Specimen signatures o f authorized signatories in AISA will&#13;
be approved by the Minister o f Finance and to be submitted to the World Bank prior to commencing&#13;
disbursements.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
A.      Country Context&#13;
&#13;
The Bank has gained substantial experience and understanding o f the procurement environment in&#13;
Afghanistan through its involvement in the interim procurement arrangements put in place through&#13;
EPAP as well as with the institutions with current responsibility for those and the subsequent&#13;
arrangements, namely ARDS.            As part o f the broader review of Afghanistan's Public Finance&#13;
Management (PFM) system, the Bank carried out an assessment o f the procurement environment in the&#13;
country based on the baseline and performance indicators developed by a group o f institutions led by the&#13;
World Bank and OECD/DAC.&#13;
&#13;
The first key issue identified through the procurement assessment was the need for ownership and a&#13;
champion in the Government for reform, deepening o f capacity, ensuring integrity in the operation o f&#13;
procurement systems, and promoting sound procurement among ministries.&#13;
&#13;
A new Procurement Law has beenadopted inNovember 2005 whichradically transforms the legal and&#13;
regulatory framework. While it provides a very modem legal system for procurement, it may be difficult&#13;
to implement inthe current context. The Procurement Policy Unit (PPU) has now been established under&#13;
the MOF to ensure implementationthrough the creation o f secondary legislation, standardbidding&#13;
documents, provision o f advice and creation o f the necessary information systems for advertising and&#13;
data collection. It further relies on the development o f an independent complaints review mechanismto&#13;
ensure enforcement. These institutional arrangements are yet to be inplace.&#13;
&#13;
 In the absence of adequate capacity to manage procurement activities effectively, some interim&#13;
arrangements have been put inplace to improve the procurement management o f the country. A central&#13;
procurement facilitation service has been established under A R D S which i s supervised by the Ministry o f&#13;
Economy. The Bank and the Government has agreed on a program for country wide procurement reform&#13;
and capacity building, leading to the transition from centralized to decentralized procurement services.&#13;
The Bank funded Public Administration Capacity Buildingproject (PACBP) i s the primary instrument&#13;
for implementing the program to strengthen capacity o f the line ministries to manage public procurement&#13;
in an effective, transparent and accountable manner. However, the implementation o f the procurement&#13;
capacity building strategy has not made any significant progress yet due to lack o f coordination and&#13;
delays in decision making within the Government. The envisaged radical changes to the procurement&#13;
management environment expected from the new Law also require the urgent implementation o f a&#13;
comprehensive human resources and capacity development program.               The implementation o f the&#13;
procurement reform component o f the PACBP should be considered with due priority to ensure that&#13;
fiduciary standards are further enhanced and that capacity i s developed in the Government to maintain&#13;
these standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.      ProjectProcurement&#13;
&#13;
Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated M a y 2004; and "Guidelines:&#13;
Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated M a y 2004, and the&#13;
provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The general description o f various items under different&#13;
expenditure categories i s described below. For each contract to be financed by the Grant, the different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs,&#13;
prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank project team&#13;
in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually, more frequently if&#13;
required to reflect actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. The&#13;
Procurement Plan has been drawn up on the assumption that eventually the project may fund the Kamari&#13;
Industrial Park, in addition to the Hissar-e-Shahi park, through an additional grant. The expected dates&#13;
for award o f contracts for the Kamari Park i s based on the assumption that a decision on the additional&#13;
financing will be taken about a year after approval o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Procurementof Works: Works procured under this project would include: Land leveling, construction&#13;
o f boundary wall, and security rooms, construction o f water reservoir, flood protection dyke, road&#13;
pavement, waste water treatment plan, and land fill sites for the Hissar-e-Shahi and Kamari parks. The&#13;
procurement will be done usingthe Bank's Standard BiddingDocuments (SBD) for all ICB and National&#13;
SBD agreed with (or satisfactory to) the Bank for all NCB. Other method o f procurement will be&#13;
shopping. Threshold limit for N C B works will be USD 5,000,000 and for shoppingwill be USD 100,000&#13;
per contract.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this project would include: (a) Equipment for solid&#13;
waste collection and disposal (storage bins, skips etc.), (b) 10~1.2MW diesel generators including fuel&#13;

transformer, (d) 4 xl.2 MW diesel generator including fuel tank and HT panel protective equipment, (e)&#13;
Monitoring laboratory equipments and equipment for institutional capacity building in AISA and the&#13;
Ministryof Commerce. The procurement will be done usingBank's SBD for all ICB and National SBD&#13;
agreed with (or satisfactory to) the Bank for all NCB. Other methods will be shopping and direct&#13;
contracting. Threshold limit for NCB goods will be USD 200,000 and for shopping will be USD 100,000&#13;
per contract.&#13;
&#13;
Selectionof Consultants: This includes consultancy services for design and environmental assessment&#13;
(already contracted),    industrial parks implementation supervision, building AISA capacity in&#13;
procurement, financial management and environmental management, investment facilitation, research&#13;
and monitoring and policy advocacy capacity, and capacity buildingo f Ministry o f Commerce staff. The&#13;
selection methods for selection o f consultants will include QCBS, QBS, and CQS, LCB, FBS individual&#13;
consultant and Single Source Selection. Single Source Selection may be used when appropriate and prior&#13;
IDA agreement shall be obtained. Short lists o fconsultants for services estimatedto cost less than&#13;
$100,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely o f national consultants in accordance with&#13;
the provisions o fparagraph 2.7 o f the Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;

AISA will have overall responsibility for all procurement under the project including the procurement o f&#13;
goods and TA for the Ministry o f Commerce. An assessment o f the capacity o f the Implementing&#13;
Agency to implement procurement actions for the project was carried out inMarch 2006.&#13;
&#13;
The Industrial Parks Development Department o f AISA has limited experience in domestic and&#13;
international procurement o f works, goods and services. For the three industrial parks funded by USAID,&#13;
all procurement responsibilities are carried out by USAID consultants. These construction contracts are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    38&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
turn-key, where implementation supervision i s being done by USAID appointed implementation&#13;
supervision consultants. The role o f AISA's Industrial Parks Development Department has been limited&#13;
to making site visits and discuss progress with the implementation consultants. The Procurement Unit o f&#13;
AISA i s staffed with two procurement officers. The two procurement officers have experience o f 20 and&#13;
2 years each. They have experience o fprocurement under shopping procedure for goods only. They have&#13;
no experience in procurement o f works and consultancy services nor do they have experience in&#13;
procurement under Bank financed projects. So far, the unit has been involved in procurement o f goods&#13;
up to value o f USD 100,000. AISA has had some experience in awarding consultancy contracts for&#13;
limited environmental assessment and design work in the past, with substantial assistance o f the Afghan&#13;
Reconstruction Development Services (ARDS).&#13;
&#13;
The Department will require substantial capacity building in order to undertake the procurement for two&#13;
large industrial parks, i.e., the procurement o f works, goods and services, including the preparation o f&#13;
tender documents, technical and financial analysis o f bids, contract award and ensuring procurement&#13;
according to the World Bank's Guidelines.         AISA will require a full-time expatriate Procurement&#13;
Specialist for a period o f up to 24 months and a local Procurement Engineer to assist the Deputy&#13;
Director. It will also require support staff to help with the procurement process. The Procurement&#13;
Consultant could be a regional expatriate consultant with substantial experience in domestic and&#13;
international procurement, and familiarity with World Bank procurement guidelines, methods and&#13;
implementation. The local procurement engineer should have 5-10 years experience on domestic and&#13;
international procurement specific to construction industry andor rehabilitation projects. The support&#13;
staff could be a technical graduate or diploma engineer, with familiarity o f construction industry&#13;
procurement. AISA could seek A R D S assistance in the procurement work, since ARDS i s financed by&#13;
the World Bank to facilitate large procurement contracts, good and services in the reconstruction o f&#13;
Afghanistan. The Bank has reviewed the TORSfor the Procurement Specialist, Procurement Engineer&#13;
and Support Staff.&#13;
&#13;
The following actions have been agreed with AISA to mitigate the risks:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         0   The AISA shall hire a competent Procurement Specialist to support the project and build&#13;
             capacity within AISA to carry out procurement actions under the project&#13;
         0   Procurement documentation for large value o f goods, works and consultancy contracts shall&#13;
             be carried out by the P U o fARDS with technical evaluation support from AISA.&#13;
&#13;
The overall project risk for procurement i s high.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
D.       Procurement Plan&#13;
&#13;
The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation which provides&#13;
the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed between the Borrower and the Project&#13;
Team on November 13, 2006 and i s available at Shahmahmood Ghazi Watt. Kabul, Afghanistan. It will&#13;
also be available inthe Project's database and inthe Bank's external website. The Procurement Plan will&#13;
be updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project&#13;
implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
E.       Frequency of Procurement Supervision&#13;
&#13;
Inadditionto the priorreview supervisionto be carried out from Bankoffices, the capacity assessment&#13;
o f the ImplementingAgency has recommended two supervision missions to visit the field to carry out&#13;
post review o f procurement actions.&#13;

                        TECHNICAL ANNEX9: ECONOMIC              AND FINANCIAL       ANALYSIS&#13;
                         AFGHANISTAN:PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENTPROJECT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Scarcity o f data and the high level o f uncertainty in Afghanistan make it difficult to cany out a rigorous&#13;
financial and economy analysis o f the project. The problem i s compounded by two additional factors.&#13;
Firstly,given the current low incidence of industrial activity inAfghanistan, the emergence o f about 200&#13;
small and medium scale enterprises, clustered in two important locations, i s likely to have a wide range&#13;
o f spill over effects. While industrial activity anywhere has a spill over impact, the impact i s usually&#13;
substantial where the initial base i s small. Such spill over effects are difficult to measure, especially in a&#13;
country with little track record and paucity o f data. Thus, while this analysis tries to take into spill-over&#13;
effects, the results will most likely grossly underestimate the true returns from the investment. The second&#13;
source o f an underestimate i s the difficulties o f assessing returns from capacity buildingactivities, which&#13;
account for an important part o f the project. Because o f such difficulties, the capacity buildingcomponent&#13;
o f the project has not been included in the quantitative analysis that follows. Again, in a country where&#13;
the initial base (of capacity) i s low, capacity building efforts, especially in important agencies, strategic&#13;
agencies, i s likely to have a significant spill over impact going beyond the agencies themselves. These&#13;
caveats needto be kept inmindwhile assessing the results o fthe financial and economic analysis.&#13;
The analysis focuses on the Hissar-e-Shahi industrial park to be supported by the project and covers a&#13;
time period o f 20 years. The costs include the cost o fbuildingand operating the park. The benefits stream&#13;
relate to the most important stakeholders o f the project and include the following:&#13;
&#13;
          Industrial enterprises. Profits earned from the operation o f the enterprises&#13;
&#13;
          Employees of the enterprises. Wages and salaries earned&#13;
&#13;
          Other businesses: Wage income created due to spill over impact&#13;
&#13;
          Government. Taxes earned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Basecase assumptions&#13;
 1.       Development costs. Cost o f developing the park amounts to $19.5m without taxes. The financial&#13;
cost o f land i s not included since these will be merely transferred from one government agency to another&#13;
and the opportunity cost o f land i s taken as zero because currently these plots o f land are unused.&#13;
2.        Operating costs. The following costs o f operating the park are considered: a) utility costs, b)&#13;
administrative costs o f AISA related to industrial park operation, c) depreciation o f equipment and&#13;
physical infrastructure.&#13;
3 .       Number of enterprises in the parks. It i s assumed that, when the park i s fully occupied, it will&#13;
host a total o f 100 enterprises    .'This   i s based on an assumed plot size o f roughly 7000 sq. m. per&#13;
enterprise (the size o f the Hissar-e-Shahi Park will be 106 hectares or 1,06,000 sq. m., o f which about&#13;
two-thirds will be devoted to industrial plots). It i s assumed that the cumulative number o f enterprises in&#13;
production will increase in the following manner: 20% at end o f year 4; 50% by end o f year 5, 75% by&#13;
end o f year 6 and 100% by end o f year 7. It i s assumed that it will take 2 years to build the park and two&#13;
years for an enterprise to commence operations after it starts construction o f the factory building.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7Given the huge demand for industrial land, the industrial park i s expected to be fully occupied within a few years&#13;
&#13;
surveyed inJalalabad - the highest proportion for any city - cited access to land as a major or severe constraint to&#13;

&#13;
                                                         49&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.    Capacity utilization. Enterprises are not expected to attain full capacity utilization immediately after&#13;
commencing production. It i s assumed that on average an enterprise will have an average capacity&#13;
utilization o f 40% duringits first year o f operation, 60% duringyears 2-4 and 75% after that.&#13;
5.       Average investment levels and proJit rates. It i s assumed that average initial investment in the&#13;
enterprises will be $0.5m and that an average enterprise will earn profits equal to 10% o f initial&#13;
investment by year 7 when it is operating at 75% capacity. Profits will be proportionately lower in&#13;
previous years due to a lower rate o f capacity utilization.&#13;
6.       Average employment and wage rates. It i s assumed that the enterprises will employ, on average,&#13;
100 employees at 75% capacity utilization. The employment level will thus increase during the initial&#13;
years o f an enterprise till it reaches this level o f capacity utilization. It i s assumed that the average annual&#13;
wage inthe industrial park enterprises will be $1500. This i s assumed to remain constant over the 20 year&#13;
period, in other words it i s assumed that the annual rate o f increase inthe wage rate expressed inAfghanis&#13;
will equal the rate o f depreciation o fthe Afghani currency vis-a-vis the dollar.&#13;
7.       Spill over impact. It i s assumed that every job created in the industrial park will be associated&#13;
with two jobs created in other sectors, including, activities related to the supply o f raw materials to the&#13;
industries, activities usingthe output o f the industries as inputs,businesses involved inthe distribution o f&#13;
the industrial park outputs and businesses providing other services to the industrial enterprises and&#13;
workers. It i s assumed that thesejobs will have an average annual wage rate o f $ 1000, i.e., 33% less than&#13;
those o f the workers inthe industrial park since the latter are expected to be more productive on average.&#13;
9.       Government's tax revenues. It i s assumed that there will be a 15% tax on the profits earned by&#13;
the enterprises operating inthe industrial park.&#13;
&#13;
10.      Income earned by industrial park authority. It i s assumed that the plots inthe industrial park will&#13;
be sold at a unit price o f $25 per sq. m. This i s the price charged for plots inthe existing Bagrami Park. It&#13;
i s assumed that this will be paid in five equal installments over a five year period, starting from year 3&#13;
(for 75% o f the enterprises) and year 4 (from 25% ofthe enterprises).&#13;
&#13;

Summary of results, including sensitivity analysis&#13;
Base case results&#13;
The analysis, which is based on a discount rate o f lo%,       indicates that the industrial park project generate&#13;
an economic NPV of US$198m, corresponding to an ERR o f 61% per cent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sensitivity tests&#13;
Ten sensitivity tests were carried out by changing the values o f the critical variables. These tests reveal&#13;
that the base case results are robust for a wide range o f the parameter values. The economic returns will&#13;
not undergo any qualitative change under any of the assumed scenarios.&#13;

                          AFGHANISTAN:PRWATESECTOR DEVELOPMENT                       PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The bulk o f the project funds will be spent on an industrial park at Hissar-e-Shahi, near Jalalabad.&#13;
Additional financing could be considered in future for a second industrial park at Kamari, near Kabul.&#13;
This section is written on the assumption that eventually both these parks may be funded through this&#13;
project. The industrial park component o f the project will trigger two safeguard policies o f the Bank, OP&#13;
4.01 on Environmental Assessment and OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement. The environmental and&#13;
social impact assessment and environmental and social management plans summarized in this section&#13;
relate to this component. N o environmental and social issues are expected to arise with regard to the&#13;
capacity building components o f the project. The only exception i s the capacity building related to&#13;
environmental and social management in AISA which will have a positive environmental and social&#13;
impact.&#13;
&#13;
The proposed Hissar-e-Shahi Industrial Park will cover an area o f 106 hectares and will be located about&#13;
25 km from Jalalabad City on the northern side o f the main highway to Torkham.'                         The proposed&#13;
industrial park will comprise o f the following industries: a) light engineering; b) food processing; c)&#13;
leather garments; and d) carpet washing and finishing. The specific industries that private investors will&#13;
establish within the broad categories o f light engineering and food processing i s not known at this stage.&#13;
Hence, the calculation o f pollution loads at this stage is relatively generic and will needto be refined once&#13;
the specific nature o f the industries and technologies to be used are known. However, this i s not expected&#13;
to require any substantial change inthe design of the proposed environmentalmitigation plans.&#13;
&#13;
The proposed Kamari Industrial Park will be located in Bagrami District, about 10 km east o f Kabul on&#13;
the Kabul - Jalalabad road just beyond the existing Bagrami Industrial Park. The proposed park will&#13;
cover an area o f 135 hectares. This piece o f land originally belonged to the Ministry o f Defence and has&#13;
been transferred to AISA. The proposed park will have an industrycomposition broadly similar to that o f&#13;
the Hissar-e-Shahi Park except that it will also include carpet weaving.&#13;
&#13;
Roughly 60% o f the land inthe two parks will be industrial area, about 30% will be taken up by roads and&#13;
10% by public uses and utilities. The industrial plot sizes will range from 2000 sq. m. to 12000 sq. m.&#13;
Currently, it i s envisaged that most plots will be between 2000 sq. m. and 6000 sq. m.. Although all the&#13;
industries suggested for the parks are quite similar in terms o f processes involved &amp; compatibility, some&#13;
zoning will be done to minimize environmental problems. This will be particularly true o f the food&#13;
processing industry,which may require a more exclusive location.&#13;
&#13;
Environmentaland SocialImpactAssessment&#13;
&#13;
The environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) has been prepared at the basic planning and&#13;
preliminary design stage o f the project. The Master plan o f the proposed industrial park has been&#13;
approved by AISA and the preliminary design o f the basic infrastructure has been finalized. The ESIA&#13;
identifies the pollution sources anticipated at the preliminary design stage and provides some estimates of&#13;
various wastes expected to be generated and pollution abatement measures for these anticipated wastes.&#13;
Some estimates and assumptions will needto be updated as project design i s finalized. Specifiedpollution&#13;
abatement measures for each industrial unit to be set up in the parks will be spelt out in the enterprise-&#13;
specific assessments that will be carried out by the individual project sponsors and assessed by the&#13;
Afghan .National Environmental ProtectionAgency (NEPA) and AISA.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        i s scope for future expansion o f this park to 200 hectares, though not necessarily with support from this&#13;
project. The environmental and social assessment covers this future expansionpotential.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            52&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 The ESIA process involved the collection o f primary and secondary data as well as consultations with&#13;
 relevant stakeholders. The ESIA has identified the environmental and social impact for both the&#13;
 construction and operational stages o f the project (details below). On the social front, the construction of&#13;
 the Hissar-e-Shahi park involves resettlement o f 26 migrant families who had been temporarily living in&#13;
 mudhouses in one corner o fthe proposed site. Thisresettlement with adequate compensation has already&#13;
 taken place, inAugust 2006 (details below). Actions to deal with the environmental and social impact are&#13;
 detailed in the Environmental and Social Management Framework prepared for the project. This i s&#13;
 available as a separate document; a summary discussion i s provided below.&#13;
&#13;
 Anticipatedenvironmentalimpacts&#13;
&#13;
 Duringconstruction&#13;
&#13;
Ambient air quality and noise pollution. Construction activity will generate noise, particulate matter&#13;
 (PMlO), smoke, dust, CO, and NOx in the ambient air. Similarly activities like excavation, compaction&#13;
 dumping and storage o f excavated material will also create dust, noise and vibration. Such pollution will&#13;
 be greater ifold, ill-maintained vehicles and equipment i s used. Due to increased anthropogenic activities,&#13;
 ambient air quality o f the site will decrease considerably. However, this impact will be o f temporary&#13;
 nature as the ambient air quality will improve with the completion o f the construction stage. Noise and&#13;
 vibration will increase in the project area and adjacent areas due to inflow o f trucks and other vehicles.&#13;
 Residents o f the nearby settlements will be affected especially at night time.&#13;
&#13;
 Surface water quality. The main impact duringthe construction phase will be the increase insediments to&#13;
 the surface water during clearing and grubbing, filling as well as the potential release o f any chemicals&#13;
 and oil spills at the site duringthe construction stage. Ifthese are allowed to be deposited on the site, they&#13;
 will be absorbed in the storm water and ultimately contaminate the surface water quality o f Nangarhar&#13;
 canal, which runs by the proposed park site. Sewage will be generated at the construction camps. If the&#13;
 generated sewage i s not properly treated or disposed of, this may have a negative impact on the surface&#13;
 water quality.&#13;
&#13;
 Solid waste. Solid waste generation, comprising o f waste from construction camps and other waste, will&#13;
 increase considerably during construction. Residential waste comprises all the waste generated from the&#13;
 Workers Camp area. The major components o f this waste are garbage, putrescible wastes, rubbish and&#13;
 small portion o f ashes and residues. Immediate attention i s required for such type o f wastes as these are&#13;
 degradable and cause odor. The other waste generated i s mostly composed o f rubbish, ashes and residues,&#13;
 demolition materials and hazardous wastes. These wastes will be generated due to the construction&#13;
activities and materials used for construction.&#13;
&#13;
Natural drainagehlope: Excavations o f trenches for laying o f the water supply pipeline will generate&#13;
excavated materials which will be used for filling works. However, some o f the excavated material will&#13;
not be reused and, if left at places o f excavation, will cause dust pollution and hindrance to the natural&#13;
drainage o f the area. Another source o f spoils on construction sites i s discarded construction materials that&#13;
include chemicals, wires, plastics, cut pieces o f pipes, pieces o f empty fuel and lubricants tins, cardboard&#13;
packing and other discarded materials.&#13;
&#13;
Soil contamination. The type o f industries planned in the industrial park will produce hazardous waste&#13;
such as toxic metals, chemicals, plastic material, batteries, aluminum, steel, oil, grease etc. the industries&#13;
will not produce waste like radioactive, pesticides etc., which are very dangerous and requires great care&#13;
in handling, storage and transportation. Some of the chemicals used in the laying of water supply pipe&#13;
joints are hazardous and toxic. The sheathing on electric wires and cables are made from hydrocarbon&#13;
compounds and are toxic, as are paints and varnishes used in the construction industry.Ifadequate care i s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      53&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
not taken for handling, storing and transportation o f these toxic substances, it may damage the health o f&#13;
the workers as well as contaminate the soil. The waste from the proposed project should be properly&#13;
treated, stored, recycled (if possible) and disposed off through appropriate technical measures. The&#13;
treatment, storage and disposal o f hazardous waste should follow strict requirements. Workers must be&#13;
made familiar with the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) o f each chemical used at site.&#13;
&#13;
Biological environment. Flora is sparse in the area. Not a single tree exists and only degraded forms o f&#13;
grasses and some small shrubsherbs exist in the Project Area. The grass cover and the shrubby growth&#13;
shall be removed during the construction phase, which will have a negligible effect on the status o f&#13;
existing flora. Fauna in the Project Area shall be disturbed to some extent, as the reptiles like snakes and&#13;
lizards, living in the holes or long tunnels, shall either get killed or shall move to adjoining areas, on&#13;
account o f use o f heavy machinery for construction o f roads and other infrastructure. Their hideouts shall&#13;
be destroyed or filled up during the process. This i s a moderate negative impact. Similarly birds like&#13;
Mynah, House Sparrows, who build nests in the small bushes in the area, shall be negatively impacted&#13;
and will have to leave for adjoining areas. During the construction phase excavations, construction o f&#13;
roads and buildings will involve transportation and movement o f heavy constructional machinery in the&#13;
area. Personnel employed for this purpose will not only visit the area fkequently, but some will also stay&#13;
on the site, which can cause harassment to Avifauna besides noises which will scare away birds and other&#13;
biota. However, these activities will occur for a limited period as it i s only a temporary phase, will not&#13;
have any significant effect on the surrounding floralfauna and habitat o f the region.&#13;
&#13;
Duringoperation&#13;
&#13;
The following emissions and wastes are expected to be generated from the proposed industrial parks&#13;
duringthe operation o f the various industrial units.The wastewater shall be generated mostly from the&#13;
industrial units (industrial wastewater) and partially from commercial and institutional activities.&#13;
&#13;
Ambient air quality. It i s anticipated that industries will generate air pollution in the form o f various&#13;
gases. These include SOX, NOX, CO, and PM10. This will deteriorate the quality o f ambient air. The&#13;
impact will be o f permanent nature and needs mitigation measures. Emissions o f these air contaminants&#13;
will have to be controlledat source to avoid air pollution.&#13;
&#13;
Noise pollution.         Industrial units will create noise and vibrations. The noise levels will be maximum&#13;
inside the industrial units and will impact the technicians the most. Noise levels will usually be kept to&#13;
below 85 dB (A). Where the noise levels will exceed this, use o f PPE's such as ear muffs will be required.&#13;
Duringthe full plant operation, anticipated noise levels outside the factory buildingswill be below 60 dB&#13;
(A) at a distance o f 100 meters and beyond. The direct affectees o f this noise pollution will be the&#13;
workers worlung in the industrial parks. Residents o f nearby villages will also be affected by the noise&#13;
and vibration generated.&#13;
&#13;
Solid waste. Based on the planned industry composition, the expected solid waste generation will range&#13;
from 0.25 to 0.5 tons per hectare per day, i.e., in the range o f 20 to 35 tons / day for each park.g It i s&#13;
proposed that the solid waste collection, transportation and disposal system for each park should be&#13;
designed for 50 tons / day.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                54&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Surface Water Quality.         A considerable amount o f wastewater is anticipated to be generated due to the&#13;
operation o f the industrial units. In the Hissar-e-Shahi park, any contamination from the proposed&#13;
industrial area in future may pollute the Nangarhar canal water and shallow aquifer along the left bank o f&#13;
the canal. The characteristic o f the wastewater depends on the type o f industrial units since each type o f&#13;
industryhas different wastewater quality parameters depending on its processes. The waste water quality&#13;
expected to be generated from the proposed industries i s described in the Box below. It i s proposed that&#13;
collection o f wastewater system shall be combined, i.e., sanitary and industrial wastewater shall be&#13;
collected through a single pipeline. Therefore, a mixture o f sanitary and industrial wastewater shall be&#13;
produced."&#13;

Groundwater Contamination. Presently the Project Areas are totally barren. The groundwater tables in&#13;
the areas are deep, no water ponds or industry are present in and upstream o f the Project Area, except a&#13;
small plastic factory in Hissar-e-Shahi, which i s currently not in operation. Therefore, no contamination&#13;
source to groundwater aquifer i s foreseen inand around the Project Areas.&#13;
&#13;
Biological environment.          Various industrial units, like food processing, light engineering and leather&#13;
industries will emit gases and discharge chemical laden water, which if allowed untreated will adversely&#13;
effect flora, fauna and surrounding environments resulting in air and water pollution. This will also&#13;
adversely affect vegetation due to heavy chemical concentration in water and noxious gases interfering&#13;
with photo synthesis and growth o f plants. Such gases will kill avifauna also. On account o f permanent&#13;
construction o f roads and industrial units wild life present in the Project Areas such as snakes, lizards&#13;
shall move to the adjoining areas and the birds that have their nesting in the low bushes in the area will&#13;
move to the nearby trees or fields. This i s a minor negative impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
loThe expected characteristic of this mixed wastewater shall be as follows: BOD5 = 100 to 600 mg/l; COD = 200 to 900 mg/l;&#13;
SuspendedSolid = 200 to 1500mgil; pH = 6 to 10.&#13;

                                                             55&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   Water requirementsandwater supply system&#13;
&#13;
   It is estimated, based on the expected industry composition, that each o f the parks will need about 0.25&#13;
   MGD o f water for a 75 hectare park size. In addition, firefighting will require an additional reserve of&#13;
   120,000 gallons.&#13;
&#13;
   Two water sources are available at Hissar-e-Shahi: surface water from Nangarhar Canal and groundwater.&#13;
   The canal i s located near the northern boundary o f the project area. According to officials inthe irrigation&#13;
   department, water from the canal will not be available for industrial use over the year since the canal&#13;
.  remains closed for some months each year for clearing. The quality o f water during the raining season&#13;
   further degrades due to the quantity o f sediments. Moreover, the analysis o f canal water indicates that&#13;
   while it can be used for firefighting and other purposes it i s not fit for drinking. The water has to be&#13;
   treated to make it fit for drinking and other industrial use. This option may prove costly and i s not&#13;
   considered.&#13;
&#13;
   The option o f usingthe other source, i.e. ground water, was investigated. Duringreconnaissance survey o f&#13;
   the project area it was observed that shallow tube wells exist within the project site and its adjoining areas&#13;
   and ground water i s available at a depth o f about 40m to 50m. Samples o f existing water samples were&#13;
   collected from the site and tested against the WHO drinking water quality parameters. The results were&#13;
   found satisfactory. Hence, at Hissar-e-Shahi, water will be supplied from shallow tube wells within the&#13;
   project site and its adjoining areas where ground water i s available at a depth o f about 40m to 50m.. Three&#13;
   tube wells o f 1.0 cfs. capacity will be installed and each is expected to operate about eight hours daily.&#13;
   This will be sufficientto meet the daily requirements o fthe park.&#13;
&#13;
   For the Kamari Industrial Park, water will be supplied from the Logar Well Fields, about 4 km. to the&#13;
   west o f the proposed Park site. The Logar Fields are being developed to supply water to Kabul city and&#13;
   adjacent areas. This will involve the sinking o f several wells, o f which two (LG22 and LG23) will be the&#13;
   source o f water supply for Kamari. A main water pipe line will connect the wells to the nearby township&#13;
   o f Arzan Kimat and a second pipe will connect the Kamari park to this main line. The Afghan Water&#13;
   Supply Authority (AWSA) will be responsible for the sinking o f the wells. Consultants working on the&#13;
   design o f this project have confirmed that the wells will be able to meet the water requirements o f the&#13;
   industrial park without jeopardizing supply to the other customers. The land over which the pipeline&#13;
   connecting Kamarito the main line has not yet been identified.&#13;
&#13;
   Water works. Similar water works will be developed for both parks. The water works shall comprise o f&#13;
   undergroundtank, pumproom, overhead tower and generator. Water obtained from the tube wells will be&#13;
   stored in covered RCC under-ground tanks, to be located in the water works area. Water from the&#13;
   underground storage tanks shall be pumped to the overhead towers. For this purpose, pumps shall be&#13;
   installed in the pump rooms, proposed to be constructed on the underground storage tanks. A gravity&#13;
   flow water distribution network comprising o f pipes, gate valves, air valves, washouts etc. will be&#13;
   provided in both parks. The system will be connected to the overhead tower and underground tank&#13;
   respectively for low and highpressure zones. The pipe network will be connected to the industrial units&#13;
   and other facilities.&#13;
&#13;
   Social assessment&#13;
&#13;
   Hissar-e-Shahi&#13;
&#13;
   The Hissar-e-Shahi Project Area has no agricultural activity and, with the exception o f 26 migrant&#13;
   families, no habitation either. The resettlement issue regarding these 26 families, and its resolution, i s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        56&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
discussed below. The Study Area for the proposed park, Le., the adjoining area where an impact i s likely&#13;
to be felt, contains four settlements (see box for a brief description o f each). A socio-economic survey&#13;
was carried out in three o f these settlements covering the 26 households in the Project Area and 256&#13;
households in the Study Area. The Study Area households were distributed as follows: a) Hissar-e-Shahi&#13;
Camp (48), Kabul Camp (88) and Chora Gali (120). The field survey data was complemented by data&#13;
collected from relevant departments in Jalalabad. The variables covered by the survey related to&#13;
demography, occupation, education, housing, health, family income, expenditure and debt, basic&#13;
amenities, livestock, role o f women and cultural values. The survey also covered the perceptions o f&#13;
different stakeholders about the project (duringand after the construction stage).&#13;
&#13;
Interviews were conducted with notables (Maliks) and stakeholders and group discussions were held with&#13;
a cross section o f the people from the different settlements. Stake holders were interviewed in the field,&#13;
through structural questionnaires with the help o f local interpreter having good command on Pashto&#13;
language. The detailed results are provided in the ESIA for the Hissar-i-Shahi Park. The main findings&#13;
withregardto household characteristics are as follows.&#13;
&#13;
The dominant family size group inthe project area has between 3 and 4 family members and, inthe study&#13;
area, between 5 and 6 members. The female population i s about 49 per cent. Illiteracy rates are high,&#13;
about 80% and most working members o f the households work as laborers or servants. 95% o f the&#13;
households in the project area use water from community tube wells on payment and only 5 % carry&#13;
water from Nangarhar Canal. In the study area, 50% households obtain their water from the community&#13;
tube wells and 50% from Nangarhar Canal. N o household in either the project or study area has access to&#13;
electricity. N o proper sanitatioddrainage facilities are available and waste water i s disposed o f in the&#13;
open spaces just outside the houses. Telephone, Post Office, Metalled road facilities are not available in&#13;
the Project and Study Area. However, these facilities are available in Jalalabad city. There i s only one&#13;
school inthe Study Area located inthe Kabul Camp; it i s usedbothby girls and boys. The buildingo f the&#13;
school i s in poor condition. There are only two dispensaries in the Study Area and only two private&#13;
clinics.&#13;
&#13;
Prejudice against female education i s strong and most o f the respondents. Female respondents in the area&#13;
informed that there was no lady doctor, trained lady health visitors or maternity homes inthe area and are&#13;
constrained by the Pardah (veil) system from going outside and receiving treatment. They travel outside&#13;
the village only in a serious condition to get treatment from the hospital in Jalalabad City or to attend&#13;
weddings o f relatives. Three maternal death cases have been reported during the last one year. The&#13;
women have no formal role inthe authority structure o f the villages inthe Project and Study Areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Settlements around Hessar-e-Shahi Industrial P a r k&#13;
&#13;
    Hissar-e-Shahi Camp.The Hissar-e-Shahi camp is partly located inthe Project Area and partly inthe Study&#13;
    Area. The people living in this camp are Pashto speaking Afghan Muhajreen (refugees), originally from&#13;
    Kunar Province (Afghanistan), and residing at this site for the last one and a half year. Their main&#13;
     occupation is labor. The camp i s located at an approximate distance o f a half kilometer (km) from main&#13;
    road is accessible through a dirt track. The camp completely lacks infrastructural facilities. The residents&#13;
     fetch water from an existing tubewell located about 1 km from the site by paying Rs.50 /month to the&#13;
     contractor. The residents are prone to water borne diseases due to lack o f sanitation facilities.&#13;
&#13;
    26 families were residing inthe area o f Hissar-e-Shahi camp that lies within the Project Area limits. During&#13;
    the focus group discussion conducted by the environmental and social consultants in the camp area, it was&#13;
    revealed that the people are happy about the proposed project but requires compensation for relocation.&#13;
&#13;
    Kabul Camp. The Kabul Camp i s located in the Study Area o f the proposed Park and was constructed in&#13;
    the early nineties. The camp comprises nine blocks and each block has 170 houses with an approximate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          57&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     population o f 1050 people. The main occupants o f the camp are refigees from Pakistan and originally&#13;
     belonged to the Pashtoon and Tajik tribes. The camp is accessible through a dirt track. There i s only one&#13;
     primary school for both boys and girls near the Kabul Camp. The camp lacks in institutional and civic&#13;
     facilities. Water for domestic use i s self carried from a community tubewell by paying Rs.50 /month to the&#13;
     contractor. The influential people have their own water taps in their houses and pay Rs. 350Imonth water&#13;
     charges to the contractor. The pressing needs o f the Kabul Camp residents, as articulated through a survey,&#13;
     are hospital, high school, transport, electricity and water etc.&#13;
&#13;
     Chora Gali. The village Chora Gali i s located on the right bank o f Nangarhar Canal about 25 km from&#13;
     Jalalabad city and 3 km from the main road (Thorkham-Jalalabad). The people living in Chora Gali are&#13;
     Afghan Muhajreen from the following tribes: Mola Khail, Mian Khail and Mulla Khail. Pashto is the only&#13;
     language spoken inthis village. Around 650 houses exist inthe village which has a population o f 5100. As&#13;
     inother cases, the village lacks ineducational, institutional andcivic facilities. A few residents usually shift&#13;
     to Kabul City during the summer season. The residents use Nangarhar Canal as the main source o f water&#13;
     for both domestic as well as drinking purposes. The main diseases afflicting the villagees are Malaria,&#13;
     Typhoid, Diarrhea and Tuberculosis etc. Maliks are the influential people o f this village. Pure drinking&#13;
     water, hospital, school, transport and electricity are the pressing needs o f this village.&#13;
&#13;
     Nachaabad. The Nachaabad village i s located northwest o f the proposed industrial park at an approximate&#13;
     distance o f 4.5 km. The Pashto speaking people living in this village are basically from Rodat District and&#13;
     are locals. The village is accessible from the proposed Industrial Park through a dirt track whereas an&#13;
     independent road connects this village to main Torkham-Jalalabad road. The main source o f income i s&#13;
     through agricultural activities. The only and the nearest source o f surface water i s Nangarhar Canal and&#13;
     agricultural activities are dependent on this source. For drinking purposes, mostly community shallow&#13;
     pumps are being utilized. The village altogether lacks inbasic amenities, infrastructure etc. however, the&#13;
     living conditions o f residents of this village are much better in comparison to other villages described&#13;
     above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The sample survey findings show that the average monthly income i s US$69 in the Project Area and&#13;
US$121 in the Study Area. Several households had expenditures greater than incomes and most o f them&#13;
reported to be under debt. 52% o f the respondents in Study Area borrowed US$ 1,000 US$ or less while&#13;
30% borrowed more than US$2,000 duringlast year. The money borrowedby the residents o f the Project&#13;
and Study Area was mainly used for meeting the household needs (i.e. marriage, household expenditure,&#13;
construction o f house and business).&#13;
&#13;
The area has no archaeological importance except one grave yard which i s about 50 to 70 years old.&#13;
However, this i s located far away from the proposed IndustrialPark location.&#13;
&#13;
Kamari&#13;
&#13;
There are six villages in the Study Area o f the proposed Kamari Park. These are (with number o f&#13;
households inparentheses): Karaz Bakar (350), Daminah (700), Hussain Khel (600), Kila Mohsin (125),&#13;
Kamari (100) and Arzan Kemat (650). A socio-economic survey similar to that for Hissar-e-Shahi was&#13;
carried out covering 50 households, including seven in the Project Area and 43 in the Study Area. The&#13;
&#13;
exceptional findings are the following: a) higher average household incomes - $220 per month in the&#13;
socio-economic profile as revealed by the survey i s broadly similar to that in Hissar-e-Shahi. The main&#13;
&#13;
Study Area compared to only $69 in Hissar-e-Shahi; b) a higher proportion o f households involved in&#13;
farming (16.3%) and trading (25.65) than in Hissar-e-Shahi; c) 95% of houses are cemented compared to&#13;
very few in Hissar-e-Shahi. 56% o f the households obtain water from community hand pumps and the&#13;
rest from dug wells. No households have access to electricity and there are no proper sanitatioddralnage&#13;
facilities. One of the villages has a primary school and two have a middle school. Boys and girls use the&#13;
same schools. Illiteracy rates are lower than inHissar-e-Shahi, i.e., 43%. This reflects the relatively better&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            58&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
educational opportunities due to proximity to Kabul. There i s not a single dispensary and no Lady Health&#13;
Visitor i s available inthe Study Area. As i s Hissar-e-Shahi, there are strong biases against women.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Resettlement issues&#13;
&#13;
The land acquisition for the parks will be carried out according to the land acquisition laws o f&#13;
Afghanistan, Section-40 o f the Constitution o f Afghanistan contains relevant legal provisions for the&#13;
compulsory acquisition o f land in the public welfare. Land being used for the development o f Hissar-e-&#13;
Shahi IndustrialPark belongs to the government (Canal Department), therefore no compensation for land&#13;
i s foreseen.&#13;
&#13;
There are some resettlement issues regarding the Hissar-e-Shahi site. Twenty six families had been&#13;
residing inthe Project Area o f the Hissar-e-Shahi site. They were living intemporary mudhuts with a tent&#13;
or plastic cover as ceiling. All o f them are immigrants and had been residing at the site on a temporarily&#13;
basis (a list o f the affectees i s provided in the Environmental Management Plan document). Almost all&#13;
the affected persons are relatives o f each other and their huts are located in isolation from nearby&#13;
settlements.&#13;
&#13;
AISA started consultation with these affectees for the evacuation of site prior to the issue o f the Draft EIA&#13;
report. Three major meetings between AISA and the affectees were held. The first meeting was held on&#13;
June 19, 2006 which was also attended by the environmental consultants. As per the demand o f the&#13;
affectees, a compensation payment o f U S $100 per family plus one tent worth $ 100 for each family was&#13;
approved by AISA. This i s a fairly generous compensation since the mud walls for one hut can be put&#13;
together by two unskilled laborers in one day, which would cost in labor terms US$5 given the current&#13;
wage rate o f US$ 2.5 per day for unskilled workers. The evacuation process was completed on August&#13;
18, 2006 as per agreement between AISA and the affectees. The families have been relocated to an&#13;
adjacent government land. The process i s documented inthe EIA.&#13;
&#13;
There are only three permanent structures in the project area. These are constructed o f burnt brick&#13;
masonry walls in cement mortar with precast concrete roof. They were constructed for the Administration&#13;
o f the Kabul Camp but are now abandoned with no doors and windows and the concrete roof largely&#13;
removed. These are to be demolished but no compensation will be required to be paid to anybody. There&#13;
i s a possibility that during the project construction, the contractor or the client may rehabilitate the&#13;
structure for their use and remove them at the end without any cost to the client.&#13;
&#13;
There are four structures wholly on the proposed site; three at the Northern boundary and one at the&#13;
south-west comer boundary. Details o f these buildingsare provided inthe ESIA. One o f the buildingsi s a&#13;
de-mining stores building. It i s in a bad condition and needs to be demolished although, after some&#13;
renovation it could be used as a site office duringthe construction o f the park and eventually demolished.&#13;
There i s a small room close to the De-mining Stores building which could be used as a store during&#13;
construction and then demolished. There i s an observation tower and office building, also in poor&#13;
condition which could be used temporarily during construction and then demolished, All these buildings&#13;
are inpoor shape and owned by the Government; hence, no compensation i s required.&#13;
&#13;
Two structures are partly within the original site demarcation. These include the boundary wall o f one&#13;
cemented house and part o f a residential compound. As first household i s unwilling to remove the&#13;
boundary wall, and the second i s unwilling to relocate, the site demarcation was slightly modified to by-&#13;
pass these structure. Hence, there are no resettlement issues in Kamari. However, as in Hissar-e-Shahi,&#13;
there could be opportunities to generate a range o f benefits for the households in the Study Area o f the&#13;
Kamari Park (see discussion inAttachment 4 under Social Management Plan).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
The Environmental and Social Manapement Plan&#13;
&#13;
Environmental Management Plans have been prepared for both parks, based on the environmental and&#13;
preliminary social assessments. These plans lists the mitigation and remedial measures to be implemented&#13;
during the construction and operation o f the parks to minimize, redress and alleviate the impact o f water&#13;
and air pollution, noise, chemical &amp; biological pollution from industrial activities, and the impact o f the&#13;
requisite services network including on land use. Specifically, the EMPs:&#13;
&#13;
      outline the mitigation measures requiredto avoid or minimize the negative impacts.&#13;
      develop a monitoring mechanism and identify the monitoring indicators for assessing effectiveness&#13;
      o f the mitigation measures.&#13;
      define the roles and responsibilities o f the implementing agency, AHA, in implementing the EMPs&#13;
      and identify areas where these roles and responsibilities can be shared with other parties involved in&#13;
      the execution and monitoring o fthe Project.&#13;
      define the requirements necessary for documenting compliance with the E M P and communicating it&#13;
      to all concerned regulatory agencies.&#13;
      prescribe the mechanisms for            on-going consultation with stakeholders during project&#13;
      implementation.&#13;
&#13;
The EMPs will be part o f contract and tender documents to ensure that the cost o f EMP implementation i s&#13;
built into the contractor costs. The Contractor will be legally bound for the execution and implementation&#13;
o f the EMP. AISA with the help o f an independent monitoring company (see below for details on the&#13;
company) will ensure that coordination with project stakeholders on environmental and social matters as&#13;
requiredby the EMP i s maintainedthroughout the implementationperiod o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
For each park, the EMP includes a detailed Mitigation Management Matrix that summarizes the&#13;
mitigation measures for both the construction and operational stages and, for each measure, identifies the&#13;
agencies that would be responsible for monitoring and management. Athough the responsibilities for&#13;
executing and monitoring the mitigation measures has been delegated to different organizations, AISA&#13;
will hold the primary responsibility for ensuring the full implementation o f the EMP. AISA and the&#13;
contractors will ensure that the mitigation measures mentioned in the Mitigation Management Matrix&#13;
(MMM)are followed duringimplementationofthe proposedproject.&#13;
&#13;
A broad-based social assessment will be carried out in early 2007 to build upon the preliminary&#13;
assessment. The issues faced by women and their needs will be assessed separately in this report (the&#13;
preliminary assessment that has been done did not involve separate interviews with the women members&#13;
o f the households). Female social specialists will be part o f the team. A Social Management Plan (SMP)&#13;
will be developed based on this assessment. The broader assessment will identify the specific training&#13;
needs o f the households, in particular women, and the SMP will identify appropriate training programs&#13;
that may help them obtain jobs in the industrial park in the construction and, inparticular the operational&#13;
phase. The SMP will also provide recommendations on how the industrial park operations may help&#13;
improve the supply o f social services, inparticular for women who, as the preliminary assessment shows,&#13;
are severely deprived o f these services. Strategies for introducing good working practices inthe industrial&#13;
units to be located in the parks, including the treatment of women workers and child labor will also be&#13;
spelt out. The implementation o f the SMP will require dedicated attention to this.&#13;
&#13;
An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has beenprepared for the project and&#13;
identifies the specific measures to be taken to implement the EMP and the SMP. In addition to dealing&#13;
with the impact already predicted based on currently known design parameters, the Framework also&#13;
outlines an approach to deal with environmental and social impact o f sub-projectshnfrastructural&#13;
interventions that will be identified later, such as land fill sites, location o f power distribution line linking&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       60&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the parks to the main transmission lines, location o f water pipeline linkingthe Kamari Park to the main&#13;
water transmission line. The ESMF contains a summary o f the EMP, plans for an SMP, the Mitigation&#13;
Management Matrices for the two parks and an action plan to operationalize the EMP and SMP.&#13;
&#13;
An international expert will be hired as an Environmental Manager in AISA for 18 months to help&#13;
implement the ESMF. The project will provide funding for this. He/she will be assisted by two local&#13;
experts, an Environmental Officer and a Social Development Officer, who will be funded by AISA.&#13;

The overalllegal and regulatory framework&#13;
&#13;
The EMP and SMP will be implemented in the context o f the overall legislative and regulatory&#13;
framework for environmental management in Afghanistan. Two important aspects o f this framework are&#13;
the Environmental ProtectionAct approved by the Afghanistan cabinet inDecember 2005 and the Afghan&#13;
National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) established in 2005. The Act spells out frameworks&#13;
for managing natural resource conservation, biodiversity, drinking water, pollution control, and&#13;
environmental education, and clarifies the administrative roles at the national level and coordination with&#13;
provincial authorities. NEPA i s a regulatory authority and mainly responsible for developing and&#13;
implementing national environmental policies and strategies in order to integrate environmental issues&#13;
and sustainable development approaches into the legal and regulatory frameworks. NEPA i s also&#13;
responsible for assessing the effectiveness o f implementation o f the environmental legislations and&#13;
regulations and related measures. NEPA i s expected to actively coordinate and cooperate with Ministries,&#13;
Provincial Councils and District and Village Councils, public bodies and private sector on all&#13;
environment related issues. The Afghanistan Environmental ProtectionAct empowers NEPA to take legal&#13;
action against non-compliance o f environmental legislations and regulations and impose penalties. NEPA&#13;
i s a newly established agency and lacks the capacity to carry out its mandate effectively. This i s&#13;
particularly true o f its provincial offices."&#13;
&#13;
Environmental and social managementcapacity inAISA&#13;
&#13;
AISA, in collaboration with NEPA, will be responsible for ensuring the overall implementation o f the&#13;
EMP and SMP. It will ensure that the contractor carries out all project activities as per provisions o f EMP&#13;
and other applicable environmental laws and regulations. During the operation o f the industrial park,&#13;
AISA's Industrial Parks Department will be responsible for ensuring that the individual tenants comply&#13;
with the EMP and SMP. An independent monitoring agency will be contracted to monitor the&#13;
implementation o f the EMP and SMP during the construction stage and initial operational period o f the&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
Environmental and Social Policy. AISA currently doesn't have any environmental or social policy. AISA&#13;
will formulate an environmental and social policy that: a) states its commitment to prevent pollution,&#13;
continuously improve environmental performance, and comply with applicable laws and international&#13;
health, safety and environmental practices; b) states its commitment to ensuring that the industrial parks,&#13;
including the individual enterprises, operate in a manner that i s consistent with social good practices, and&#13;
c) state how AISA will implement its environmental protection and management plan, and its social&#13;
management plan. The formulation o f the policy should take into account the stated goals and the level o f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11 These offices lack qualified staff, environmental monitoring equipment, laboratories, computers and other office&#13;
equipment. There i s also lack o f awareness among provincial office staff about the roles and functions o f the NEPA.&#13;
Itis necessary to buildcapacity inthe regional offices through logistic support, providing qualified technical staff,&#13;
and in-house and external training to key staff on environmental management, monitoring and auditing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         61&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
resources that AISA i s willing to commit to achieve them. Once established, the environmental and social&#13;
policy will help communicate AISA environmental and social management commitment to its staff,&#13;
customers, government officials and others.&#13;
&#13;
Suggested institutional set-up within AISAfor implementation of the EMP and SMP. AISA will set up an&#13;
Environmental Management Unit (EMU) within the Industrial Parks Department. It will be headed by an&#13;
Environmental Manager with an adequate number o f environmental specialists. For the first year o f its&#13;
operation, the EMUwill be provided with the services o f an external environmental advisor who will help&#13;
set up the environmental management system and train the local environmental staff. The EMUwill work&#13;
inclose coordinationwith the other unitsinthe IndustrialParkDepartment that will beresponsible for the&#13;
construction and operational phases o f the park projects. The Planning Section in AISA's Industrial Park&#13;
Department has the primeresponsibility for supervising the engineering related aspects during design and&#13;
infrastructure development o f the industrial parks and the construction o f industrial units. Environmental&#13;
staff will work with this section in order to implement the EMP at the construction stage. AISA will also&#13;
appoint a Social Development Officer to design and implement social management initiatives and ensure&#13;
social compliance by the tenants o f the parks.&#13;
&#13;
AISA will operate the parks for the first three years o f its operation. After this, the industrial park&#13;
management contract will be transferred by AISA to the Investor's Association, comprised o f the tenants&#13;
o f the parks. The Association will appoint a private firm management firm for the operation and&#13;
maintenance o f the park, to be designated as the Industrial Park Manager. The Manager will be&#13;
responsible for environmental and social management, monitoring and compliance within the EMP and&#13;
SMP, including operation and maintenance o f the waste water treatment plant. During the operational&#13;
stage, the EMUand the Social Officer will work with the Operations and Maintenance Section o f AISA&#13;
inensuringthat the IndustrialParkManager is carrying out itsresponsibilities adequately.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Role of other players&#13;
&#13;
NEPA.     As a regulatory authority, NEPA's main function is to develop and implement the national&#13;
environmental policies; hence, its role vis-a-vis the industrial parks will be that o f an independent&#13;
monitoring agency. NEPA will inspect the parks at its own convenience or on receipt o f complaint from&#13;
any person or NGO about non-compliance o f any environmental legislation or its part. As NEPA will be&#13;
the issuing authority o f NOCs for the industrial units to be located in the parks, it will be kept informed&#13;
about the implementation o f suggested mitigation and remedial measures through EMP. AISA will keep&#13;
close liaison with NEPA.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Supervision Consultant. AISA will appoint an implementation supervision consultant to&#13;
oversee the work o f the contractors. The Consultant will be responsible for: a) Supervising the works o f&#13;
Contractor; b) Ensuringthat the day-to-day construction activities are carried out in an environmentally&#13;
and socially sound and sustainable manner; c) Assisting the environment staff in coordinating with the&#13;
NEPA, Provincial Environmental Protection Directorate, and provincial agriculture and canal&#13;
departments, district administration, NGOs and other publidprivate sector organizations.&#13;
&#13;
Project Contractors. For the proposed project, AISA will appoint Contractors for the construction and&#13;
other project activities. The Contractors will be responsible for the implementation of, or adherence to, all&#13;
the provisions o f the EMP and SMP and with any environmental and other code o f conduct required by&#13;
NEPA. Overall responsibility for the Contractor's environmental performance will rest with the Director&#13;
IndustrialParks, AISA.&#13;
&#13;
Independent Monitoring Contractor (IMC). To fulfill the monitoring requirements set out in the EMP and&#13;
SMP, AISA will appoint an independent monitoring contractor (IMC). Functioning as an independent&#13;
organization, the I M C will be responsible for carrying out monitoring according to the requirements o f&#13;
the EMP and SMP. It will directly report to the AISA and closely liaise with NEPA, other concerned&#13;
government authorities and the World Bank. It will prepare compliance report and documents as&#13;
suggested in the EMP and SMP and submit them to AISA. The I M C will also be responsible for the&#13;
review and updating o f EMP and SMP as and when required. The I M C will be responsible for the&#13;
implementationo f EMP and SMP only for the first year o f the operational stage.&#13;

            Afghanistan - Private Sector Development
            Support Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The private sector development support
            project for Afghanistan aims to increase the volume of
            private investment and productive jobs in Afghanistan. The
            specific goals that will contribute to this are: to enhance
            the provision of land and infrastructural services for
            enterprise development; to enhance the capacity of
            government agencies to analyze private sector development
            (PSD) issues, and develop and implement PSD-related
            strategies, policies and programs. Enhance the capacity of
            government agencies to promote Afghanistan as an investment
            destination and provide investment facilitation services. By
            helping to address the land constraint, this project will
            attract private investment in a variety of sectors,
            including but not limited to manufacturing, agribusiness,
            and smaller scale infrastructure projects. The industrial
            park will help stimulate the local economy generate
            employment, and raise much needed tax revenues.
