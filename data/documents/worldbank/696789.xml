Chapter I&#13;
The Energy Sector&#13;
A. Overview&#13;
1.1       Viet Nam began the transition from a centrally planned to a market economy in 1986, at&#13;
the Sixth Congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party. This process was accelerated in 1989 with the&#13;
devaluation of the Dong and the decontrolling of most prices. In 1993, Viet Nam obtained access to&#13;
concessional international finance, while the US embargo was lifted in early 1994. All these events&#13;
provided a stimulus to the economy, which responded with a rapid growth of about 8% per annum&#13;
(p.a.) over 1992-1994. The gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to continue growing at this rate&#13;
for the rest of the decade. In the economy's continued transition and growth, the energy sector, which&#13;
provides approximately one third of the nation's foreign exchange earnings, will play a vital role. Viet&#13;
Nam's economic development will be closely linked to growth in energy supplies in general, and&#13;
electricity in particular.&#13;
1.2       Per capita consumption of commercial energy in Viet Nam, at around 135 kilograms of oil&#13;
equivalent (kgoe), is amongst the lowest in the world. In comparison, per capita consumption is 215&#13;
kgoe in the Philippines and 325 kgoe in Thailand. Biomass and fuelwood still account for about 60%&#13;
of total primary energy consumption. Petroleum products made up 47% of primary commercial energy&#13;
consumed in 1992, with coal (21%) and hydropower (32%) making up the balance. Commercial&#13;
energy consumption has grown relatively quickly in the last two years, 10% in 1993 and 12.5% in&#13;
1994. However, over this period there has been a major shift in its composition, with a decline in the&#13;
consumption of coal and an increase in the consumption of electricity (10% p.a.) and petroleum&#13;
products (9.5% p.a.).&#13;
1.3       There are substantial regional differences in the country's energy endowments and the&#13;
pattern of energy consumption. The North has an excess of hydro and coal-fired power resources, and&#13;
surplus power is now being exported to the Center and the South over a 500 kV transmission line&#13;
commissioned in 1994. This has to some extent eased the electricity shortages that these two regions&#13;
had been suffering during recent dry seasons. The South, however, is geographically closer to the&#13;
hydrocarbon resources that have so far been discovered, and has had a more reliable supply of&#13;
petroleum products.&#13;
B. Domestic Energy Endowments&#13;
1.4       Viet Nam has considerable indigenous primary energy potential, in the form of oil, gas,&#13;
coal and hydro. These could not only meet projected national demand, but also allow additional exports&#13;
of oil and coal. Viet Nam's energy potential is, however, largely unexplored and under-exploited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
The Oil and Gas Sector&#13;
1.5       Viet Nain's hydrocarbon potential is estimated to be in the order of 4,000 - 6,000 million&#13;
barrels (mmb). Proven and probable reserves are currently estimnated at around 1,000 rnnb of oil and&#13;
3.6 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas, of which 2.3 tcf is associated gas. However, recent discoveries and&#13;
further drilling in known fields indicate that these estimates would be upgraded.&#13;
1.6       By 1994, four offshore oil fields had been discovered: Bach Ho, Rong, Dai Hung and Du&#13;
Block 15-2 of Rang Dong fields (discovered by JVPC of Japan). Production at the Bach Ho field,&#13;
operated by VietSovPetro, is currently 7 million tons per annum (tpa). The Dai Hung field, operated&#13;
by a consortium lead by BMP Petroleum of Australia, began production in October 1994 and its&#13;
production in 1995 is estirated at 1.1 million tons. The Rong field contains an estimated 30-40 mmb,&#13;
and its production in 1995 is estimated at about 1 million tons. The oil reservoir discovered by JVPC&#13;
in the Rang Dong field contains two layers of product; tests show that in the upper layer the production&#13;
could be about 4,000 barrels/day (bpd) and in the lower layer about 10,000 bpd.&#13;
1.7        Until recently, offshore gas development was linked to oil production. In 1994, a large&#13;
unassociated natural gas field was discovered at Lan Tay-Lan Do on Block 6 by the Oil and Natural&#13;
Gas Commission of India (ONGC), British Petroleum (BP) and Statoil of Norway, with an estimated&#13;
reserve of about 2 tcf. Based on production forecasts, Bach Ho alone is not expected to be able to&#13;
sustain a stable gas supply for 15-20 years of the quantum required by downstream users and will have&#13;
to be supplemented with the production from Dai Hung and Rong. The production of the Lan Tay-Lan&#13;
Do fields could be rather large and about 70 billion cubic feet (bcf) per annum could be available from&#13;
1998. A gas pipeline from Bach Ho to Ba Ria has already been completed; the pipeline would be&#13;
extended to Phu My in 1997 and Thu Duc power station in 1998.&#13;
1.8       Viet Nam does not yet have an oil refinery, and the entire crude oil production is&#13;
exported, the bulk of it to Japan. Refined petroleum products are currently imported to meet demand&#13;
and are distributed by truck, rail and barge; there is currently only one pipeline for the transportation of&#13;
petroleum products, from Quang Ninh port to the Hanoi area. There are plans to construct a refinery&#13;
near Nhatrang by 1999, with a capacity of 6.5 million tons (mmt) (below national demand for oil&#13;
products at this date). The refinery is expected to be financed by a consortium composed of Total&#13;
(France), the Chinese Petroleum Corporation (Taiwan) and the China Investment and Development&#13;
Company (China).&#13;
The Coal Sector&#13;
1.9       Viet Nam's coal reserves are estimated at 2,345 mrnt of anthracite, 78 mrnt of semi-&#13;
anthracite, 38 mmnt of coking coal, 96 mnmt of thermal coal and 306 mint of lignite. The commissioning&#13;
of the 1,920 MW Hoa Binh hydro plant in the north has led to a drop in coal demand from the power&#13;
sector, and coal mines are currently operating at around 50% capacity. This has pushed up costs of&#13;
production by 20%.&#13;
1.10      While the production costs of Viet Nam coal are low, the ocean freight rates charged from&#13;
Viet Nain ports are two to three times the freight costs of Australian coal to similar Asian and European&#13;
destinations. These high costs are due to slow loading rates and smaller ship handling capacity at&#13;
Vietnamese ports. Viet Namn exported just under a third of its total coal production of 3.9 mit in 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
1.11      The export market is likely to be the key for future growth in the coal sector. The export&#13;
of anthracite and the possible export of electricity to China from coal-fired stations in the north&#13;
represent the major export markets for coal. However, the successful export of anthracite will require&#13;
improved port facilities. If this is done, Viet Nam could be exporting as much as 2.3 mint by 2000 and&#13;
3.6 mmnt by 2010.&#13;
Hydroelectric Resources&#13;
1.12      Substantial hydropower resources exist in Viet Nam, estimated to be in the region of&#13;
10,000 MW (3,000 MW in the south and 7,000 MW in the north). The Son La site in North Viet Nam&#13;
is the largest of the schemes that could be developed, with a potential of 2,400 MW - 3,600 MW. In&#13;
the Southern and Central regions there are 10 as yet undeveloped sites with an aggregate capacity of&#13;
2,400 MW, which could be developed before 2010. The largest of these is the Yali project in Central&#13;
Viet Nam (700 MW), which is under construction and scheduled to begin operation in 1999. There is&#13;
also the possibility of importing hydro power from Laos and Cambodia.&#13;
Biomass and Fuelwood&#13;
1.13      Biomass and fuelwood currently make up over 60%  of Viet Nam's primary energy&#13;
consumption. There are substantial regional variations in the type of biomass used. In the northern&#13;
rural areas, rice straws and husks represent the bulk of the fuel used, with wood representing the&#13;
remainder. In the Mekong delta in the south, wood, along with coconut shells and woody residues&#13;
make up the bulk of traditional fuels, while rice husks and straw play a minor role. The upland areas&#13;
of the north, center and south are in general still heavily wooded, although deforestation is proceeding&#13;
under pressure from clearing for agriculture, cutting for poles, logging and for fuelwood. As part of a&#13;
policy to conserve the forests, the Government has developed an Improved Cooking Stoves Program,&#13;
which would need to focus on areas currently having the greatest pressure on fuelwood resources. The&#13;
Bank, under Energy Sector Management and Assistance Program (ESMAP), is providing technical&#13;
assistance to the Energy Institute of Viet Nam (El) to help improve the efficiency of the productioD and&#13;
consumption of traditional fuels. Specifically, the technical assistance will assist El in: (a) the design of&#13;
a phased, costed conmnercialization plan for the program to distribute improved cookstoves; and (b)&#13;
determining options for modernizing and improving the efficiency of the coal briquettes industry.&#13;
C. Energy Consumption&#13;
1.14      Table 1.1 presents the primary commercial energy balance for Viet Nam for 1994,&#13;
excluding traditional fuels (biomass and wood). Diesel fuel accounted for just under half of the&#13;
petroleum products consumption in 1994, with gasoline and fuel oil accounting for 23 % and 24% of the&#13;
total respectively.&#13;

1.15       In 1994 electricity accounted for 14%, petroleum products 66% and coal 20% of the end-&#13;
use energy consumption. Commercial energy end-use consumption has grown at only 3 % per year over&#13;
the last decade. However, this masks two distinct phases, from 1980-1985 when petroleum products&#13;
consumption was held constant and electricity consumption increased by 8% per annum, and from 1985&#13;
onwards when there were rapid increases in the consumption of both petroleum products and electricity,&#13;
at 9% and 10% p.a. respectively. Coal consumption has declined since 1987, due to a shift in fuel&#13;
consumption patterns by households and industry.&#13;
1.16       Sector-wise, industry accounts for 42%, transport 37%, household/service 16%  and&#13;
agriculture 5% of end-use commnercial energy consumption. The bulk of energy used by the industrial&#13;
sector is coal, although the usage of electricity is expected to rise rapidly with the modernization of the&#13;
economy and the introduction of light industries. Around 50 % of household consumption is made up of&#13;
petroleum products; this sector still consumed, in 1994, twice as much coal, in energy terms, as&#13;
electricity.&#13;
1.17       Commercial energy consumption is expected to increase rapidly if the forecast GDP&#13;
growth target in the order of 8% is realized. Over the last decade, due to the substitution of electricity&#13;
and petroleum products for coal, there has been a slow growth in commercial energy consumption,&#13;
relative to GDP growth. This situation is likely to change as the demand for electricity and petroleum&#13;
products is expected to increase sharply over the next decade. This could yield an overall commercial&#13;
energy consumption growth at as much as 10% - 12% p. a.. The composition of consumption, in terms&#13;
of the relative importance of coal, gas, oil and electricity, will depend upon the availability and pricing&#13;
of gas. The power sector is expected to be the main consumers of gas; it is unlikely that the household&#13;
sector will account for a significant share of consumption, at least in the near future.&#13;
D. Institutional Framework&#13;
1.18       The energy sector in Viet Nam is largely under government ownership and control. All&#13;
authority within the sector is derived from the nation's senior Governmental and political body, the&#13;
Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister. Responsibility for planning, pricing and foreign&#13;
investment across the whole economy, including the energy sector, falls under the jurisdiction of three&#13;
State Committees which report to the Council of Ministers. The Government has in recent years&#13;
undertaken a major restructuring of the institutional arrangements to provide greater autonomy to the&#13;
managements of operating companies. There has also been an effort by the Government to rationalize&#13;
functions of the Ministries in the energy sector, with a focus on sector policy and oversight rather than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
an active role in enterprise management.   A State Enterprise Law was promulgated in April 1995,&#13;
which effectively allows the Management Boards of state corporations to perform the ownership&#13;
function on behalf of the State. This arrangement reduces the direct influence of the Ministries in&#13;
sector operations.&#13;
1.19       The Oil and Gas Sector. The oil and gas sector is consolidated under Petrovietnam (PVN).&#13;
a holding company for all enterprises in the sector. PVN was established in 1989 under the Ministry of&#13;
Heavy Industry (MHI). In 1992, PVN was transferred directly under the Prime Minister. PVN has 14&#13;
companies which include many joint ventures with foreign companies. As a holding company, PVN&#13;
negotiates and manages all production sharing contracts for the exploration of hydrocarbon resources.&#13;
The companies under PVN include: Vietgas responsible for developing natural gas resources; and&#13;
VietSovPetro, the Vietnamese-Russian joint venture responsible for the exploitation of the Bach Ho&#13;
field.&#13;
1.20       The Power Sector. Until January 1995, the power sector was divided into three distinct&#13;
regional systems each managed by an integrated power company. These companies were Power&#13;
Company No.1 (PC 1) in the North, Power Company No.2 (PC2) in the South and Power Company&#13;
No.3 (PC3) in the Center. In addition to these three utilities, there were companies for engineering,&#13;
design, construction, manufacturing and associated service entities. A premier Institute of Energy&#13;
provided much of the planning and analytical support to the sector. The entire sector was under the&#13;
Ministry of Energy (MOE) which also controlled the coal sector.&#13;
1.21       In January 1995, the Government established a holding company, the Electricity of Viet&#13;
Nam (EVN), for the entire power sector. The MOBE' was rationalized to provide only policy support&#13;
to the sector. EVN is comprised of 34 separate business units. Five separate distribution companies&#13;
have been created through this restructuring and have the status of "independent accounting" state&#13;
enterprises under EVN. The remaining business units are 'dependent accounting" entities (para. 2.22).&#13;
E. Energy Pricing&#13;
1.22       The Government's main objectives in setting energy prices are to ensure the financial&#13;
viability of the energy entities, to generate surplus funds for the sector to finance a significant part of&#13;
the investment program, to set prices at levels that discourage wasteful consumption and, via taxes, to&#13;
raise revenues for the general budget. However, in the electricity sector in particular, fixed assets are&#13;
undervalued and depreciation understated due to the lack of modem financial techniques. Therefore,&#13;
the estimated financial costs, which tariffs are due to recover, do not reflect the current or future costs&#13;
of production. ADB-funanced studies on tariffs and on accounting systems in the power sector would&#13;
provide the bases for imnproving the sector's financial performance (paras. 2.17 and 3.19).&#13;
1.23       Wholesale prices for petroleum products are set by the Council of Ministers based upon&#13;
the CIF cost, the exchange rate and anticipated inflation, and a 15%  import tax for gasoline.&#13;
Petrolimex, the national distribution agency, may then set retail prices within plus or minus 10% of the&#13;
official wholesale price. However, the tax on gasoline may not be collected if Petrolimex's actual&#13;
I/ The MOE was subsunied under the Ministry of Industry in October 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
purchase costs of gasoline are sufficiently above the levels anticipated. The level of taxes on petroleum&#13;
products are low compared to neighboring countries like Thailand. Both, in the interest of revenue for&#13;
the Govermnent and for energy conservation, there is a strong case for higher taxes on petroleum&#13;
products.&#13;
1.24       Viet Nam has still to lay down prices for natural gas. The economic cost of gas from the&#13;
earlier discovered fields is estimated to be in the region of US$1.3 per million BTU (MMBTU);&#13;
however, further studies are required to establish the gas base, the costs for development and transport&#13;
and the correct prices for this resource in various sectors of the economy. The price of gas to the&#13;
power sector is currently being considered in the range of US$2.0 to 3.5 per MMBTU.&#13;
1.25       Export prices for coal are determined by market forces; the principal constraint facing&#13;
Vietnamese exports is the relatively high cost of freight from Vietnamese ports. Domestic prices are&#13;
largely set by market forces, subject to minimum sales prices which are set by the Coal Consumers&#13;
Association. The minimum prices are set so that the companies producing coal break even, which&#13;
means that coal is sold below full cost. Prices for coal to the power sector are determined through&#13;
negotiation between the coal producers and the power companies; in doing this, they follow guidelines&#13;
laid down by the State Committee on Planning (SCP).&#13;
1.26       Electricity tariffs were increased almost two-fold in 1992, with the average tariff reaching&#13;
about 4.5 USc/kWh (para. 2.16). In August 1994, a tariff reform was implemented, with higher rates&#13;
for consumption above minimum levels for residential consumers. In March 1995, tariffs were again&#13;
raised by about 0.45 USc/kWh. Currently tariffs average just over 5 USc/kWh. Although the tariff&#13;
schedule contains peak and off-peak tariffs for energy, the absence of time-of-day metering, even for&#13;
the largest consumers, means that these tariffs cannot be implemented. The Government has indicated&#13;
that it wishes to raise tariffs in a series of steps to 7 USekWh by 1999. This represents the Long Run&#13;
Marginal Cost (LRMC) (actually, average incremental cost) of electricity estimnated in the Bank's&#13;
Energy Sector Review. Allowing for modest inflation of the dollar of around 2.5% p.a. over this&#13;
period, this means that by 1999 tariffs will be around 90% of LRMC, as compared to about 75% at&#13;
present.&#13;
F. Energy Conservation&#13;
1.27       The operation of the centrally planned economy, with energy prices substantially below&#13;
cost, monopoly state enterprises with little incentive to increase efficiency and the absence of&#13;
competitive markets did not encourage energy efficiency. The transition of the economy to a market&#13;
system, with competition in product markets, and pricing energy products closer to their cost will go&#13;
some way towards encouraging energy efficiency.  There is therefore considerable scope for&#13;
improvements in the efficiency of energy use in Viet Nam. The capital base of the manufacturing&#13;
industry is expected to more than double in the next decade; this will provide opportunities for&#13;
introducing energy efficiency technologies, provided the correct incentives are in place.  Energy&#13;
efficient household appliances will help to ease the burden that the rapid increase in household&#13;
electricity demand is expected to place upon the system, especially in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.&#13;
Viet Nam's commercial energy-GDP relationship, given its current GDP of US$16 billion and energy&#13;
consumption shown in Table 1.1, is US$2 of GDP per kgoe. In comparison, in 1992 Thailand had a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
GDP of US$3.1 per kgoe and the Philippines US$2.7 per kgoe. The industrialization of the country&#13;
and the switch to commercial fuels would increase energy consumption per unit of GDP, and it is&#13;
important that conservation measures, such as Demand Side management (DSM) are introduced now to&#13;
moderate the growth in the demand for energy.&#13;
1.28      The conservation of energy and end-use efficiency improvements will need to be an&#13;
important component of Viet Nam's energy strategy. Efficiency gains can be expected to be derived&#13;
from both the supply and demand sides. In the power sector, the older thermal plants consume at least&#13;
20% more fuel per kWh of electricity produced than plants in other East Asian countries. Transmission&#13;
and distribution losses are in the range of 20% or more, around two to three times the level in the&#13;
OECD. The distribution system rehabilitation components of the Power Sector Rehabilitation and&#13;
Expansion Project (PSREP) (Credit No. 2724-VN), the strengthening of transformer substations under&#13;
this project, and other rehabilitation and reinforcement projects being undertaken by EVN will&#13;
contribute substantially towards reduction of the level of losses.&#13;
1.29      Although there is a growing awareness within Viet Nam of the utility of energy efficiency&#13;
measures, there has not so far been any systematic evaluation of DSM opportunities. A Demand Side&#13;
Management study for Viet Nam has been commissioned under PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN).&#13;
G. The Environmental Sector&#13;
1.30      In 1991, Viet Nam  adopted the National Plan for Environment and Sustainable&#13;
Development: A Framework for Action (NPESD). This provides a comprehensive framnework for&#13;
establishing, over the next 10 years, the necessary policies, institutions, laws, regulations and programs&#13;
for addressing environmental issues. In the energy sector, it acknowledges that programs will be&#13;
required for environmental impact assessments (EIAs), watershed management, oil spill contingency&#13;
planning, air, water and soil pollution, and energy demand management through conservation programs&#13;
or legislation such as fuel efficiency standards for vehicles. The Government is now preparing a&#13;
National Enviromnental Action Plan (NEAP), building on the Bank's report entitled Environmental&#13;
Program and Policy Priorities (Report No. 13200-VN), addressing issues related to land use and&#13;
management, reforestation and forest/watershed protection, wetlands, coastal and forest protection,&#13;
urban and industrial pollution and policy, institutional and regulatory issues.&#13;
1.31      Viet Nam has also begun to establish the legal and institutional framework required to&#13;
implement environmental management programs. The Department of Environment and Natural&#13;
Resources (DENR) is the Government's main environmental arm. This department is part of the&#13;
Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment (MSTE) which was established in October 1992.&#13;
The Law on the Enviromnent identifies key environmental management functions, but does not define&#13;
the role and responsibilities of DENR at an operational level. DENR's capacity to perform these&#13;
functions remains limited. Within the line agencies, DepaJtments of Science and Technology have been&#13;
instructed to add environmental protection to their mandates.  Therefore, the MOE has an&#13;
environmental management role; however, in common with the other line agencies, it lacks the staff&#13;
with specialized training and experience, and does not yet have the capacity to develop and implement&#13;
sector-specific environmental guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
1.32       A Law on Protection of Environment was enacted in December 1993. Amongst other&#13;
provisions it: (a) identifies in general terms the responsibilities of the state, organizations and&#13;
individuals to prevent and remedy enviromnental deterioration and pollution; (b) provides for the&#13;
development of environmental standards and submission of environmental impact reports on new and&#13;
existing facilities and provides for responsible parties to pay compensation for environmental damage;&#13;
and (c) calls for civil and criminal penalties for violations. Several other legal initiatives relevant to the&#13;
energy sector have been completed or are being developed. These include the Act of Forestry&#13;
Protection and Development (enacted by the National Assembly on August 18, 1991), a key provision&#13;
of which requires compensation if environmental disruption occurs, ar.d designates certain areas as&#13;
protected forests for hydroelectric watersheds; and the Regulation on Environmental Protection in&#13;
Marine Petroleum Operation (enacted September 5, 1990). Waste water guidelines and regulations, and&#13;
a Mining Law are currently being enacted. However, the Law does not make clear, for example, who&#13;
shall be responsible for preparing the ElAs, or which institutions will have the mandate of reviewing&#13;
them.&#13;
1.33       It is likely that the next two years (1996-1997) would concentrate on the promulgation of&#13;
environmental umbrella legislation, institutional capacity building and drafting of specific regulations on&#13;
pollution and environmental management. The implementation and enforcement of selected regulations&#13;
in high priority areas will follow on from this.&#13;
1.34       In the conunercial energy sector, high priority areas are watershed management (affecting&#13;
hydroelectric resources) and particulate emissions from thermal plant, and surface disruption by coal&#13;
mines. Water pollution from site-specific energy industry investments, and air pollutior. from sulphur&#13;
emissions and NO/VOC emissions may have a relatively low priority, yet it is expected that they will&#13;
be addressed in the 1997-2001 time horizon primnarily because these problems can be handled using&#13;
relatively straightforward control technologies.&#13;
H. Energy Sector Strategy and lssues&#13;
1.35       In its wider program to reform the economy, the Government is moving from price&#13;
liberalization measures, which have so far been very successful, to more difficult institutional reforms,&#13;
such as restructuring and privatizing state-owned businesses. The Government has restructured the&#13;
power sector by creating a holding company, EVN, and organizationally separating the core power&#13;
sector operations of generation, transmission, and distribution. This operational separation in itself&#13;
represents a fairly significant step in the right direction. While the structure will still have a single&#13;
authority over the entire sector, the Government would gradually need to sequence further reforms&#13;
especially in the development of a legal and regulatory framework that would allow for strong&#13;
regulatory oversight and greater autonomy and financial responsibility at the enterprise level. This&#13;
careful pacing and sequencing of reforms is particularly important for the power sector which has&#13;
strong monopolistic characteristics. The studies initiated under PSREP and follow-up studies under the&#13;
proposed project (para. 2.26) will not only assist the Government in making these decisions and in&#13;
implementing them but will also allow the achievement of broader objectives of introducing mnarket-&#13;
oriented mechanisms in all sectors of the economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
1.36       The demands placed upon the power sector by the pace of economic growth, in particular&#13;
in the cities of Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi, are likely to be severe. This makes the reform of the sector to&#13;
introduce efficient and flexible management essential. It will also require the mobilization of financial&#13;
resources, internally through changes in tariffs and taxes and in the longer-term externally through&#13;
foreign direct equity investment and bilateral/multilateral aid and the implementation of an integrated,&#13;
least-cost development program for the energy sector. This will require that the MOE maintain iis&#13;
policy making capacity to provide guidance to the sector as a whole.&#13;
1.37       As far as pricing of energy products is concerned, there are two issues which are of&#13;
imnportance. The level of duties and taxes on petroleum products is low compared with successful&#13;
neighboring economies such as Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. There is considerable scope for the&#13;
Government to raise additional revenue for the budget by raising duties, in particular on gasoline and&#13;
diesel fuel. This would also have the benefit of dampening the increase in demand for these products.&#13;
Secondly, the price of electricity is substantially below LRMC. The Government's indication that&#13;
tariffs will be raised to 7 USc/kWh by 1999 is, therefore, welcome. It is important that electricity is&#13;
correctly priced to send the right price signals to consumers. The introduction of metering to support&#13;
time of day tariffs, at least for the largest consumers, and the possible application of seasonal tariffs,&#13;
will help to achieve this objective.&#13;
1.38       In the coal sector, the Govemment agencies should move away from operations and focus&#13;
more on policy implementation, research and regulation for safety and pollution control. The success&#13;
of exports will depend upon the development of modem handling facilities at ports.&#13;
1.39       There is already extensive private sector involvement in the petroleum sector, with the&#13;
operation by foreign consortia of oil fields within Viet Nam's territorial waters, and the likelihood of&#13;
private sector financing for the refinery. The Government's role within this sector should continue to&#13;
be at a regulatory and policy-making level. As far as the development of gas resources is concerned,&#13;
the policy should be to ensure correct pricing of gas, and ensuring availability of gas to sectors where&#13;
it has the highest value; predominantly in the power sector.&#13;

Chapter II&#13;
The Power Sector&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
2.1        Viet Nam's power sector is divided into three distinct regional systems. Till recently,&#13;
these systems were managed by PC1 in the North, PC2 in the South and PC3 in the Center. With the&#13;
creation of EVN in January 1995, the operations in the power sector are managed by the following&#13;
entities:&#13;
North&#13;
Power Company No. 1 (PC1)  Power generation below 30 MW, regional load dispatch and power&#13;
transmission and distribution at or below 35 kV in the North, except&#13;
Hanoi.&#13;
Power Company of Hanoi      Power distribution in Hanoi.&#13;
Transmission Company 1      Power transmission above 35 kV in the North.&#13;
Transmission Company 4      National load dispatch center and 500 kV transmission.&#13;
Five Generation Units       Pha Lai, Uong Bi, Ninh Binh, Hoa Binh, Thac Ba.&#13;
South&#13;
Power Company No. 2 (PC2)  Power generation below 30 MW, regional load dispatch and power&#13;
transmission and distribution at or below 35 kV in the South, except&#13;
HCMC.&#13;
Power Company of HCMC       Power distribution in HCMC.&#13;
Transmission Company 2      Power transmission above 35 kV in the South.&#13;
Six Generation Units        Thu Duc, Tra Noc, Ba Ria, Tri An, Thac Mo, Da Nhim&#13;
Center&#13;
Power Company No. 3 (PC3)  Power generation below 30 MW, regional load dispatch and power&#13;
transmission and distribution at or below 35 kV in the South.&#13;
Transmission Company 2      Power transmission above 35 kV in the Center.&#13;
One Generation Company      Vinh Son&#13;
2.2        The North has an installed capacity of about 2,673 MW and a peak demand of about 1,100&#13;
MW. The South has an installed capacity of about 1,495 MW and a peak demand of about 1,055 MW.&#13;
The Center has an installed capacity of about 250 MW and a peak demand of about 190 MW. The&#13;
available generating capacities are well below installed capacities due to poor condition of the thermal&#13;
plants.&#13;
2.3        The North has abundant coal and hydropower resources; in contrast, the South and Center&#13;
regions face acute generation deficiencies and require substantial additions of capacity over the near&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
future. Fuel options for power generation in the South include: (a) off-shore natural gas; (b) coal,&#13;
imported either from the North or fr,n regional countries; and (c) hydropower, both from the South&#13;
and from the two other regions. In C; .tral Viet Nam, the demands are low and the region has a large&#13;
hydropower potential which can be tapped for the benefit of both the Center and the South. A 500 kV&#13;
line linking the three regions was completed by the Government in 1994; this facilitates interregional&#13;
power transfers and an integrated development of the national grid.&#13;
B. The Power Market&#13;
The Growth of Electricity Demand in Viet Nam&#13;
2.4        Viet Nam has seen a very rapid growth in the demand for electricity over the last decade,&#13;
averaging 9.9% p.a. over the period 1981-1993. This is conimensurate with GDP growth of around&#13;
79% over the same period. Sales of electricity in 1994, at just over 9,200 Gwh, were treble the levels&#13;
of 1981. Growth was slowest in PC1, although it still averaged 8.2% p.a., with sales in PC2 and PC3&#13;
growing at 10.0% p.a. and 12.6% p.a., respectively. There was a slowdown in the growth of sales in&#13;
PC2 and PC3 in 1990-1992, due to chronic shortages in electricity supply; since these have eased,&#13;
growth has accelerated again.&#13;
2.5        Table 2.1 compares sales, losses, and peak demand for the three systems for 1994. For&#13;
the country as a whole, average total losses were about 21 % of generation of which non-technical losses&#13;
were about 3%.&#13;

2.6         Sectorally, industry represents the largest consumer (sales of 3,893 Gwh in 1994), with&#13;
sales to residential consuners (3,236 Gwh) comparable in size. Both agriculture (1,420 Gwh) and non-&#13;
industrial sales (696 Gwh), the latter representing transport and service industries, are still relatively&#13;
small. Sales to residential consumers grew at 12.6% p.a. over the period 1985-1994, nearly double the&#13;
growth rate of sales to industry (which grew at 6.8%).&#13;
Forecasts of Electricity Demand&#13;
2.7        Since the time of the Bank's Energy Sector Policy and Investrnent Review (Report No.&#13;
10842-VN, 1993), the actual demand for electricity in Viet Nam has been growing at a much more&#13;
rapid rate than forecast. The Energy Institute has been periodically updating its load forecasts based on&#13;
economic data. Its sales forecast of August 1994 was based on Base Case average demand growth rate&#13;
over 1995-2000 of: (a) 12.9% for the whole country; (b) 11.5% for the North; (c) 14.2% for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
South; and (d) 12.8% for the Center. This has become outdated and the Energy Institute's sales&#13;
forecast of January 1995 is based on Base Case average demand growth rates over 1995-2000 of: (a)&#13;
13.7%  for the whole country; (b) 12.3%  for the North; (c) 14.9% for the South; and (d) 13.9%  for the&#13;
Center. The Energy Institute's sales forecasts for each of the regions are presented in Table 2.2.&#13;
These represent a Base Case and a High Case scenario; the Base Case assumes an average increase of&#13;
13.7% p.a. for the country as a whole until the year 2000, the High Case assumes an average increasc&#13;
of around 14.6% p.a. over the same period. After this period, lower growths of around 11.3 to 11.7%&#13;
are assumed. With the substantial increase in economic activity in the country and increasing per capita&#13;
consumption in the urban areas due to increases in the income levels, Energy Institute's High Case&#13;
demand forecast is considered to be a reasonable assumption for power planning in the near to medium&#13;
term.&#13;

MW in the North and 1,495 MW in the South). In the northern region, the completion of the Hoa Binh&#13;
hydroelectric plant (1,920 MW and 8,400 Gwh p.a.) has created substantial excess capacity; the three&#13;
large coal-fired steam generation plants in the region (Pha Lai, Nin Binh and Uong Bi) are operating at&#13;
well below 50% of their rated capacities. These plants are of Soviet and Chinese origin, and are&#13;
located near anthracite mines. All these plants are in relatively poor condition, due to the quality of the&#13;
design, dearth of spare parts, inadequate control systems and poor mnaintenance. Peak demand in the&#13;
North, at 1,000 MW, is well below installed capacity, although allowance has to be made for exports to&#13;
the South and the Center of around 400 MW, and the low availability on some of the older thermal units.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
2.9        The commissioning of the 500 kV  North-South-Center link has created a single&#13;
Vietnamese power grid and has for the time being ended the chronic energy shortages that the South&#13;
and Center had been suffering. The South anticipates importing 33 % of its power requirements through&#13;
the link in 1995. Unlike the North, the South and Center have suffered from a deficit in generation,&#13;
shortages in power being especially critical during the dry season when hydropower energy is low. The&#13;
major hydro sites in this region are Tri An (400 MW), Vinh Son (66 MW) and Thac Mo (150 MW).&#13;
There are two principal fuel-oil fired thermal generating stations in the South (Thu Duc, 165 MW, and&#13;
Can Tho, 33 MW). New combustion turbines have been added to both Thu Duc (2 x 37.5 MW) and&#13;
Ba Ria (5 x 37.5 MW). A gas pipeline, from the Bach Ho field has been commissioned to the Ba Ria&#13;
site in niid-1995 (and will be extended to Phu My by 1997 and Thu Duc by 1998), allowing these&#13;
turbines to be operated on gas. Despite these additions, there would be insufficient generating capacity&#13;
to provide a firm backup to the 500 kV link (which is single circuit) and therefore the South and Center&#13;
can expect to suffer from at least temporary power shortages when the link is inoperative.&#13;
Transmission and Distribution&#13;
2.10       Viet Nam's transmission and distribution systems are based on multifarious standards and&#13;
are old and unreliable, with overall losses of about 20% (see Table 2.1). There is an urgent need to&#13;
rehabilitate and strengthen the networks to reduce technical losses, improve reliability and thereby&#13;
reduce outages, and serve the forecast increases in demand. While PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN)&#13;
provides for extensive reinforcement of the medium voltage distribution networks, the proposed project&#13;
would cover strengthening of the high voltage sub-station capacity.&#13;
2.11       As far as EHV and HV transmission are concemed, the commissioning of the 500 kV link&#13;
(1,440 lkm long) represents the first step in the construction of a national grid. Prior to this, there were&#13;
two separate interconnected grids in the country, operating at 220/230 kV, 110 kV and 66 kV, with a&#13;
total circuit length of about 5,500 km. The development of a national link underscores the need for&#13;
modem national and regional dispatch centers and communications systems which are being covered&#13;
under PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN).&#13;
D. Viet Nam's Power Development Plan&#13;
2.12       The Govermnent's objectives for the development of the power sector are: (a) exploitation&#13;
of the vast hydropower potential of the country; (b) improvement of supply side efficiency through&#13;
reduction of losses in energy conversion, transmission and distribution; (c) promotion of foreign&#13;
investments; and (d) increasing the availability of electricity in rural areas.  In line with these&#13;
objectives, the Energy Institute has developed a generation expansion schedule, using the ENPEP&#13;
model.&#13;
2.13       Under this plan there will be a substantial addition of hydro capacity (Vinh Song, Song&#13;
Hinh, Yali, Dai Ninh, Pley Krong and Son La) and of gas-fired combined cycle capacity (Ba Ria, Phu&#13;
My and others). There is also expected to be development of coal-fired capacity in the north, at Pha&#13;
Lai and, later, at Quang Ninh. A total of 2,987 MW is expected to be added by 2,000 and 5,995 MW&#13;
by 2005.  The plan was developed using the High Case demand forecast (see Table 2.2), and a&#13;
planning criteria of Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) of about 3 days per year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
2.14          Associated with this, it is expected that about 2,832 km of 220 kV lines, 3,259 km of 110&#13;
kV lines, 7,686 MVA of 220 kV transformer capacity and 6,815 MVA of 110 kV transformer capacity&#13;
will be added to the system in the period 1995-2000. Additional capacity on the 500 kV interconnector&#13;
is expected to coincide with the commissioning of the Yali project. The development of the large Son&#13;
La scheme (2,400 MW), which is planned for the period after 2005, would require a further upgrading&#13;
of the link.&#13;

2.15         Table 2.4 shows forecasts of the regional power balance, for selected years (the most&#13;
important dimension as far as medium term planning for the power sector is concemed). It shows that,&#13;
countrywise, the reserve margin would dimninish from 57% in 1995 to about 29% in 2005, a level that&#13;
would be considered reasonable. The table also shows the extremely precarious condition of the power&#13;
supply system for the South over the 1995-1997 period, underscoring the need for urgent capacity&#13;
additions. After 1997, the situation would progressively improve with the rapid commissioning of gas&#13;
fired capacity in the early years and the coming on line of hydro capacity in the outer years.&#13;
Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Govemment would, on an annual basis, continue to&#13;
fumish to IDA for its review and comments: (a) a review of the implementation of its power&#13;
development program during the preceding 12 months; and (b) its proposed implementation program for&#13;
the next five years, and thereafter carry out the power development program taking into account IDA's&#13;
comments.&#13;

E. Electricity Tariffs&#13;
2.16         Existing tariff levels are provided in Annex 1. Tariffs were rationalized and raised almost&#13;
two-fold in March 1992; higher charges during the dry season were introduced for consumption above&#13;
set levels, and special tariffs were introduced for foreigners and partially or wholly owned foreign&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
companies. Further upward revisions in the tariffs were implemented in August 1994 and May 1995;&#13;
currently the average tariff is about D580/kWh, or about 5.3 USc/kWh. The LRMC of electricity was&#13;
estimated in 1993 to be in the range of 7 USc/kWh and the Government has expressed its commitment&#13;
to increasing tariffs to this level by 1999. Assuming relatively low levels of inflation (around 2.5%) in&#13;
US$ terms, by 1999 tariffs will be approximately 90% of LRMC, as compared to about 75% at&#13;
present.&#13;
2.17        Tariffs are currently uniform across Viet Nam. Industrial consumers face a tariff schedule&#13;
that has average, peak and off-peak tariffs, with peak rates being well over double the off-peak rates.&#13;
Unfortunately, few, if any, of these customers have time of day metering, and therefore this tariff&#13;
schedule cannot be applied. The introduction of these meters, for appropriate consumers, will be an&#13;
important step in establishing a cost reflective tariff that will provide incentives for conservation of&#13;
energy at peak times. The ADB is funding a tariff study to assist in the development of an appropriate&#13;
tariff policy, based on appropriate financial and social objectives. This study would address the&#13;
metering issues.&#13;
2.18        The present tariff structure broadly reflects the differences in costs associated with voltage&#13;
level and type of consumer. Therefore, charges to industrial consumers are highest for those supplied&#13;
at 6 kV or below, and lowest for those supplied at voltages above 20 kV. There is a subsidy element&#13;
in the Residential category; consumers face a rising block tariff. The tariffs to commercial customers&#13;
are substantially above anything paid by other consumers. It is likely that residential consumers will be&#13;
contributing proportionately more to the peak than conmmercial consumers do, suggesting that this&#13;
difference is not cost reflective. In addition, there is a tariff schedule for foreign customers (both&#13;
business and residential), with tariffs above the estimated LRMC of 7 USc/kWh. The existence of&#13;
"wholesale electricity vendors", particularly in rural areas, who buy electricity from the power&#13;
companies and resell it, metered through submeters, to small customers, is quite prevalent. The prices&#13;
the vendors charge are considerably higher than the official tariffs, ranging as high as Dl,000/kWh.&#13;
The high prices charged suggest that the willingness-to-pay for electricity in certain areas is well above&#13;
current tariff levels.&#13;
2.19        The main reform required at present is an increase in the average rate of the tariff, to&#13;
reflect to consumers the true cost of electricity supply. To improve the accuracy of the price signals&#13;
sent through the tariffs, the Government should consider: (a) introduction of metering to allow peak and&#13;
off-peak tariffs to be charged to large consumers; (b) introduction of demand charges for larger&#13;
consumers; and (c) increasing the level of tariffs charged to residential consumers, at least for&#13;
consumption over the minimum block, so that the higher rates are at least equivalent to that charged to&#13;
commercial consumers. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Government would furnish, on&#13;
an annual basis, to IDA a review of the policy and levels of its electricity tariffs, including proposed&#13;
adjustments to meet the objectives of the power development program, and thereafter implement&#13;
proposed adjustments taking into account IDA's comments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

F. Sector Strategy&#13;
The Govenment's Power Sector Policy&#13;
2.20       The power sector in Viet Nam faces a number of challenges in the coming years, the most&#13;
significant being the ability to finance and implement an investment programn of almost US$6.5 billion&#13;
from 1995-2001, to meet the unprecedented growth in electricity demand. Presently, the power system&#13;
is technically stretched to its limit and owing to years of under-investment in assets and in maintenance,&#13;
the system is inefficient and unreliable.. Further, with only 78% of the population having access to&#13;
electricity and a per capita consumption of less than 300 kWh, there is a large amount of suppressed&#13;
demand in the country.&#13;
2.21       Recognizing the need for drastic rationalization of sector policies to meet these challenges,&#13;
the Government has prepared, in consultation with IDA, a Power Sector Policy Paper that lays out its&#13;
sectoral objectives, its reform strategy and a reform implementation plan (see Annex 2 for details). The&#13;
principal elements of the Government's power sector policy are to: (a) rationalize power sector&#13;
institutions and functions; (b) commercialize the operations of sector entities through financial and&#13;
management restructuring; (c) introduce an appropriate legal and regulatory framework for the sector;&#13;
(d) adopt appropriate bulk and retail electricity tariffs, both in terms of tariff level and tariff structure;&#13;
(e) encourage and introduce private sector capital and direct participation in the sector; (f) introduce&#13;
electricity conservation and load management practices; and (g) prepare and implement a plan to bring&#13;
electricity to rural areas.&#13;
Sector Reform and Restructuring&#13;
2.22       In January 1995, the Government issued Decree No. 14/CP to establish EVN, a holding&#13;
company for the different power sector entities engaged in generation, transmission, distribution and&#13;
associated service functions. EVN comprises 34 separate business units, each with its own charter and&#13;
each reporting to EVNs Director General. These business units are grouped under two accounting&#13;
systems: (a) independent accounting, which focuses on costs and revenues; and, (b) dependent&#13;
accounting, which focuses on costs. The business units fall into three categories:&#13;
(a)   Those engaged in generation and transmission are subject to dependent accounting, and&#13;
consolidation of accounts takes place only at the level of EVN as a whole (General EVN).&#13;
There are 17 business units involved in these activities - 12 for generation and 5 for&#13;
transmission. They all report to EVNs Director General, through the Deputy-Director&#13;
General for production.&#13;
(b)   Those responsible for distribution and supply are independent accounting enterprises&#13;
(profit- or cash-generating centers), which are accountable directly to EVNs Director&#13;
General. There are five distribution units: Hanoi-PC, HCMCPC, PCI, PC2 and PC3.&#13;
(c)   Those involved in the provision of services (including finance, design and construction,&#13;
and planning) have either independent or dependent accounting status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
2.23       EVN has the legal status of a state corporation under the State Enterprise Law.&#13;
Independent accounting entities have the status of state enterprises that are members of the state&#13;
corporation (i.e. EVN). EVN's newly created Board of Management (BOM) has been vested with&#13;
responsibility to exercise the States ownership function based on the principles established under the&#13;
new State Enterprise Law. It also oversees the operation and management of EVN.&#13;
2.24       From a sector structure perspective, the core functions of generation and transmission are&#13;
separated under several regionally-oriented business units, all of which are grouped under EVN as&#13;
dependent accounting units. This restructuring has set the stage for consolidation of a transmission&#13;
business unit as a separate profit center and progressive commercialization of the distribution units.&#13;
The generation-transmission business units sell electricity in bulk to the five independent distribution&#13;
companies. Retail prices to final consumers are established by the Government and are currently&#13;
uniform across the country. The mechanism for setting the bulk transfer price (BTP) allows the&#13;
distribution companies to make a target profit; the profit level is determined by EVN. Given uniform&#13;
retail pricing and differing distribution system costs for each distribution company, the BTP is different&#13;
for each distribution company.&#13;
2.25       The Ministry of Energy (MOE), now MOI, has been significantly rationalized in parallel&#13;
with the establishment of EVN. Consistent with the Governments policy for all line ministries, MOE&#13;
is increasingly responsible for policy and oversight functions, while all operational responsibility is&#13;
being vested with operating companies.&#13;
EDA's Strategy and Assistance to The Power Sector&#13;
2.26       IDA's strategy for the power sector and the associated technical assistance are focused on:&#13;
(a) assisting the Government in introducing reformns and restructuring the power sector; (b) improving&#13;
the technical and operational efficiency of the sector through strengthening the sector institutions and&#13;
moving them towards commercialization and corporatization; (c) initiating legal and regulatory reforms;&#13;
(d) creating an enabling environment for introduction of private power; (e) promoting conservation and&#13;
encouraging environmentally and socially sustainable development; and (f) encouraging the spread of&#13;
electricity to rural areas. In furthering this strategy, IDA (under the PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN) and&#13;
under the proposed project) would focus on:&#13;
(a) Power Sector Reform and Restructuringe In association with PSREP, ESMAP began an&#13;
investigation of the needs and priorities of sector reformn. The work was a collaborative effort&#13;
between an MOEIEVN working group and the ESMAP team, and was coordinated by a high-&#13;
level government steering committee. The findings of this work, as well as options to reform&#13;
the sector was discussed at a workshop in May 1995 in Hanoi. ESMAP also conducted a&#13;
training workshop on power sector financing options in July 1995. The work done by ESMAP&#13;
is reprinted in Report No. 174/95. This report provides the framework for further reforms in&#13;
the power sector.&#13;
(b) Power Sector Institutional Strenutheninu Much work remains to be done by the Government to&#13;
achieve an increasing commercial orientation of the sector, including: (i) separating more&#13;
sharply the function of government oversight and regulation from that of sector ownership and&#13;
management; (ii) establishing a commercial arms-length ownership policy vis-a-vis EVN, in&#13;
terms of financial responsibilities and operational performance; (iii) strengthening the&#13;
administrative and management practices of EVN and its enterprises; and (iv) allowing adequate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
financial and management autonomy to the distribution companies. Technical assistance in&#13;
institutional strengthening is being provided under PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN). It includes:&#13;
improving organizational structures; streamlining administrative and management practices;&#13;
improving reporting and information flows between entities; and defining of budget and&#13;
financial control systems. The proposed project would provide for additional strengthening of&#13;
EVN through management training.&#13;
(c) Legal and Regulatorv Framework  An important element of the power sector policy is the&#13;
establishment of an effective and credible body of sector-specific legislation and regulations,&#13;
which is a prerequisite for the orderly introduction of private power. This would comprise: (i)&#13;
defining the scope of regulation and the agency to carry out this function; (ii) drafting of an&#13;
electricity law and its subsequent approval by the National Assembly; (iii) preparation and&#13;
operationalization of a Grid Code; and (iv) promulgation of the Electricity Law and&#13;
Regulations. In support of the proposed project, the ESMAP group of the Bank would provide&#13;
extensive technical assistance to the Government in developing an appropriate legal and&#13;
regulatory framework for the power sector.&#13;
(d) Development of Private Power As a key objective to encourage private sector participation, the&#13;
Government issued Decree No.87/CP on Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contracts to facilitate&#13;
private investment in infrastructure, including power. Despite this policy initiative, significant&#13;
impediments to promoting and implementing private power remain including: (i) the lack of a&#13;
proper legal and regulatory framework; (ii) the unfavorable credit-risk of EVN stemming from&#13;
low tariffs and the lack of financial disclosure; and (iii) uncertainty regarding a domestic dispute&#13;
resolution mechanism. Under the proposed project, assistance will be provided by the Bank&#13;
Group to help structure the second phase of the Phu My power station as a BOT type project.&#13;
This work would include: (i) improving the overall framnework to solicit private investment; (ii)&#13;
training for structuring and negotiating project agreements with foreign investors and lenders;&#13;
and (iii) providing project specific legal and financial consulting services.&#13;
(e) Energy Conservation and Demand Side Management A study to evaluate energy conservation&#13;
potential and methods to implement demand side management and energy conservation&#13;
programs is being conducted under the PSREP.&#13;
(f) Master Plan for Rural Electrification The proposed project provides for technical assistance in&#13;
developing a strategy and a master plan for rural electrification in the country.&#13;
Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement&#13;
2.27       IDA's first operation in the Viet Nam power sector (PSREP) has just conmmenced and the&#13;
lessons leamed from this project have been drawn upon in the preparation of the proposed project. An&#13;
important lesson has been the need for a detailed preparation of the resettlement action plan (RAP) with&#13;
a clear definition of project affected persons and the legal framework for resettlement, and assuring the&#13;
active participation of the affected people in the project and the RAP. Another significant lesson from&#13;
power projects, in general, is the need for thorough investigations in the preparation of technologically&#13;
and managerially complex projects. The proposed project includes development of a large gas-fired&#13;
thermal power complex; adequate field investigations have been made, alternatives studied, and foreign&#13;
consulting assistance has been availed of from the feasibility stage and will be continued during&#13;
implementation. Being a fast track project, adequate safeguards have been provided to achieve its&#13;
timely completion, including construction on a turnkey basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
2.28       The project would be fully consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (Report&#13;
No. 15053-VN of October 25, 1995), discussed by the Board on November 21, 1995, which sees&#13;
IDA's role for the power sector as filling an important niche not covered by other players in the sector.&#13;
This includes financing of environmentally sustainable hydropower, transmission and distribution, and&#13;
thermal power to the extent that the Bank Group could be instrumental in introducing private power&#13;
while simultaneously working with the Government in improving the legal and regulatory framework.&#13;
The policies and programs that the Government proposes to follow in the sector are consistent with the&#13;
Bank's policy guidelines for the power sector.&#13;
2.29       Viet Nams needs for financing its infrastructure are large (the power sector alone&#13;
requiring almost US$6.5 billion over 1995-2001) and the Government clearly recognizes the necessity&#13;
for private direct financing. However, to permit the private sector to participate in power development&#13;
on the required scale and in a sustainable manner, Viet Nam needs a conducive policy, legal and&#13;
regulatory framework. The present situation does not permnit such participation because of an almost&#13;
total lack of such a frarnework. Accordingly, IDA's dialogue with the Government over the past two&#13;
years has been to agree on a shift in its policy on private sector participation, help create a proper legal&#13;
and regulatory framework and to move the power sector increasingly towards conmmercialization and&#13;
corporatization. Various units of the Bank Group - FIAS, IFC, ESMAP and the Region - have&#13;
participated in this dialogue. Notable among the Bank Groups efforts so far have been: (a) the&#13;
collaborative work of ESMAP and the Government through the Power Sector Reform and Restructuring&#13;
Study (ESMAP Report No. 174/95); (b) the seminar held by ESMAP in July 1995 to sensitize the&#13;
Govemrnent to issues relating to private financing of power; and (c) the holding of a high level semninar&#13;
by FIAS and IFC in Hanoi in September 1995 on Impediments to Direct Investment in Infrastructure.&#13;
2.30       Preparing and implementing a sound policy, legal and regulatory framework will,&#13;
however, take time, in part because there is not yet a completely uniform view on private sector power&#13;
development within the Government. In the meantime, the demand for power is increasing rapidly.&#13;
Therefore, in parallel with the efforts to develop the framnework, the Government is willing to consider&#13;
private power development under BOT arrangements on a case-by-case basis, provided it is done in a&#13;
competitive and economic manner. This preparatory work will take time. The Government believes&#13;
that it needs to make some immediate investments in power generation through EVN to head off a&#13;
looming power crisis in the southern part of the country, an assessment with which IDA concurs. The&#13;
Bank Group is satisfied with the appropriateness of the overall strategy which will be implemented first&#13;
in the development of the Phu My complex.&#13;
2.31       Phu My, with an ultimate capacity of 2,400 MW, will be the largest thermal power&#13;
generation complex in the country. EVN has invited bids for the first two 150 MW gas turbines while&#13;
it has also, in parallel, received some private power proposals. EVN did not find the latter acceptable&#13;
for technical and economic reasons. There were also concerns that negotiations and finalization of&#13;
project arrangements, in the absence of a proper framework, would require considerably more time than&#13;
was available (the initial capacity increase needs to be completed by December 1996).  The&#13;
Government, therefore, requested IDA to finance these two gas turbines. The approach taken by IDA&#13;
was to predicate IDA financing on a clear up-front policy decision by the Government to introduce&#13;
private power for the second CC block of Phu My. After considerable debate at the highest political&#13;
level, the Govermment adopted the policy decision recommended by IDA. IDA's strategy has, thus,&#13;
succeeded in creating a breakthrough in the introduction of private power in Viet Nam. While&#13;
reiterating its desire to work with IDA in establishing the proper legal and regulatory framework (which&#13;
should significantly facilitate large scale and sustainable private sector involvernent in power&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
development), the Government has sought Bank Group's assistance in realizing a BOT type of&#13;
installation for the second CC block of Phu My. IDA and IFC consider the Governmnents approach to&#13;
be reasonable, and are satisfied that their involvement will help introduce private power in an orderly&#13;
manner.&#13;
&#13;

Chapter III&#13;
The Beneficiary&#13;
A. The Beneficiary&#13;
3.1        The beneficiary of the proposed credit is the Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN).&#13;
B. Organization and Management&#13;
3.2        EVN was created on January 1, 1995 by govermnent decree number 562/TTG dated&#13;
October 10, 1994 (Annex 3).  EVN, a "State Corporation" under the newly promulgated State&#13;
Enterprise Law, is an independent juridical entity acting as a holding company overseeing 14&#13;
"independent accounting" and 22 "dependent accounting" business units. EVN's legal basis, scope of&#13;
responsibilities, organizational boundaries and other institutional features are laid out in its charter.&#13;
3.3        The Ministry of Energy (MOE) which earlier exercised oversight of the power sector&#13;
enterprises, has been rationalized and most of its staff reassigned to EVN. A limited scope of&#13;
regulatory functions has been assigned to MOE. The interface between EVN and MOE remains to be&#13;
clarified and the ESMAP-funded technical assistance project on "Developing a Legal and Regulatory&#13;
Framework for the Power Sector" (para. 2.26) would assist in clarifying the details of the separation of&#13;
these responsibilities and functions.&#13;
Management Board&#13;
3.4        Under its charter, EVN's organization (Chart 1) consists of: (a) the Management Board;&#13;
(b) the Board of Directors headed by the General Director assisted by deputies and department heads;&#13;
and (c) business units. The Management Board which is the highest decision-making authority in EVN,&#13;
consists of five members headed by the Chairman (Minister of Energy). The other mernbers of the&#13;
Management Board include a Vice Chairman, a General Director, and two experts on legal, technical&#13;
and economic aspects. The members of the Management Board have a tenure of five years. The&#13;
Management Board (similar to a corporate Board of Directors) is authorized by the State to carry out&#13;
ownership and control functions on its behalf. Specifically, the Management Board is responsible for&#13;
setting up policy and giving advice to EVN's top executives.&#13;
Board of Directors&#13;
3.5        The second level of management is the Board of Directors which consists of the General&#13;
Director and four deputies in charge of production, investment, development, construction management&#13;
and finance. The main function of the Board of Directors is to implement the Management Board's&#13;
decisions and for day-to-day management. EVN has 15 functional and administrative departments for&#13;
administration, planning, organization and personnel, finance and accounting, business, power&#13;
generation, power network, international cooperation, financial estimation, project evaluation, material&#13;
and import-export, rural and mountains region power development, inspection security and technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
safety inspection. Each department is headed by a director who reports directly to the General&#13;
Director.&#13;
Business Units&#13;
3.6        Under the new EVN charter, the three formerly fully integrated power companies (PCI in&#13;
the North, PC2 in the South, and PC3 in the Center), which were responsible for generation,&#13;
transmission and distribution in their respective regions; the two Power Investigation and Design&#13;
Companies (PIDC1 and PIDC2), which undertook detailed design and construction management af large&#13;
power sector projects; the three Power Construction Companies, which undertook construction of major&#13;
power projects; and the National Load Dispatch Center, were fragmented and restructured into financial&#13;
"independent" and "dependent" business units.&#13;
3.7        The "independent' business units comprise five distribution companies, four power&#13;
construction companies, two investigation and design companies, a company for fabrication of electrical&#13;
equipment, and a communication company. The "dependent" business units comprise 12 generating and&#13;
four transmission companies, the National Load Dispatch Center, and three peripheral units for&#13;
planning, information and research. Currently, some Project Management Boards, which formally&#13;
belonged to the PCs have been separated from the PCs and now belong directly to EVN as dependent&#13;
business units. The list of EVN's business units is given in Annex 4.&#13;
3.8        Each business unit is headed by a director. While the business units are given autonomy&#13;
by EVN to appoint their own deputy directors and heads of departments, the director and chief&#13;
accountant of each unit are appointed by EVN. As presently structured, there is a tendency to&#13;
concentrate much of the decision making at the level of EVN senior management. This lack of&#13;
autonomy, particularly for the independent business units' directors, is inconsistent with the intent of the&#13;
sector reorganization to provide the independent business units with legal and financial independence.&#13;
The issue of developing a plan to implement the internal organizational changes within EVN which&#13;
would allow greater autonomy along with adequate accountability is being addressed in the study&#13;
"Power Sector Institutional Strengthening" under PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN).&#13;
C. Staff Development and Training&#13;
3.9        EVN's management and staff, drawn largely from the staff of MOE, PCI and PIDC1, are&#13;
technically competent and qualified, but are not equipped with modern tools and are inadept at modern&#13;
management practices. During the reorganization and restructuring of the sector, no employee in the&#13;
power sector was retrenched. As of January 1, 1995, EVN has a total staff of 63,788 representing the&#13;
total work force of the sector prior to reorganization. More than half (57%) of EVN staff now belong&#13;
to the five distribution companies, 16% to the power construction companies, 13% to the power&#13;
generation companies, and the rest to the transmission and other companies. As of April 1, 1995, EVN&#13;
reported 52,300 staff with fixed positions, but transfers are still taking place and the final numbers are&#13;
not yet officially known. Of this number, 3,500 belong to the managerial ranks. EVN has a staffing&#13;
ratio of 12 employees per installed MW, and 65 customers per staff. The latter figure is low, when&#13;
compared to a figure of about 120 for Thailand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
3.10       Recruitment is the responsibility of EVN's Administration Department but the business&#13;
units have been delegated the task of recruitment of their own staff within limits specified by EVN.&#13;
Staff training has also been delegated to each business unit. The National Training Center of PCI and&#13;
the training centers of PC2 and PC3 still operate under the control of the respective PCs as&#13;
technical/vocational schools. The National Training Center, in line with EVN's policy of re-educating&#13;
staff, provides technical and non-technical training on management, accounting, and computers. A&#13;
major program of upgrading training facilities and staff skills in managing new and sophisticated plants&#13;
and systems is being provided under PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN).&#13;
D. Operations and Management&#13;
Project Development and Procedures&#13;
3.11       The procedures for development of investment projects in the power sector are&#13;
cumbersome and bureaucratic. As currently envisaged, the strategy for development of long-term plans&#13;
for the power sector would be drafted by the Energy Institute and submitted to EVN and MOE for their&#13;
review and appraisal.  On the basis of these plans, projects are prepared and approved by the&#13;
Government in accordance with established procedures and stages. Once approved, feasibility studies&#13;
are appraised by the State Appraising Committee or by a committee chaired by the Vice Minister or&#13;
Vice Chairman of the People's Committee. Project proposals within EVN are subject to the following&#13;
levels of approval: (a) Level A, projects in excess of D 100 billion by the Prime Minister; (b) Level B,&#13;
projects ranging from D 6-100 billion by the Government and MOE; and (c) Level C, projects less than&#13;
D 6 billion by EVN's Board of Management. Procurement, which has caused bottlenecks and delays in&#13;
project implementation, needs to be streamlined. Currently, procurement is done by bidding in&#13;
accordance with government regulation. The National Procurement Evaluation Comnmittee evaluates&#13;
and selects bids costing above D 100 billion for the Primne Minister's approval while MOE approves&#13;
bids below D 100 billion.&#13;
Operational Performance&#13;
3.12       At present, EVN operates 15 units of various generating stations with a total capacity of&#13;
4,480 MW; of which 68% is hydro and 32% is conventional oil/gas and thermal power plants. With a&#13;
transmission line length of 6,900 circuit-kIn, it has 85 substations and 2,530 MVA transformer capacity.&#13;
In April 1994, the 1,500 km 500 kV North-South power line was completed providing 500 MW of&#13;
electricity to the central and southern provinces. The PCs, who managed the facilities prior to the&#13;
establishment of EVN, have operated these facilities and the transmission network at levels that have&#13;
been severely constrained by shortages of funds and spare parts supplies.&#13;
3.13       Power losses, including both transmission and generation losses, arnount to about 20% of&#13;
electricity produced, with estimated transmission and distribution losses being about 18 % and auxiliary&#13;
consumption being 3% of generation.  These levels are relatively high when compared to those&#13;
recorded for the more developed power grids of countries such as Thailand and South Korea. EVN&#13;
would need to exercise stricter control on its operations to reduce non-technical losses. A program to&#13;
progressively reduce the non-technical losses of PC3 in the Central Region from about 18% to 3% as&#13;
planned by the Government has been agreed with IDA under the PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
E. Financial Management&#13;
Accounting System and Promdures&#13;
3.14       The establishment of the charter of EVN coincided with the introduction by the Ministry&#13;
of Finance (MOF) of modifications to the Vietnamese accounting system. In accordance with Circular&#13;
No. 162 TB dated November 30, 1994, the Prime Minister approved the application on a trial basis of&#13;
the reformed accounting system to several state-owned enterprises including EVN. MOF and MOE&#13;
have required EVN and its business units to adopt the new system with modifications to the chart of&#13;
accounts to suit the power sector. EVN's system is designated as a "mixed" accounting system&#13;
whereby: (a) centralized accounts are maintained in the generation and transmission of electricity; (b)&#13;
all power plants and transmission companies are dependent accounting units; and (c) consolidation of&#13;
accounts take place only at the EVN level as a whole.&#13;
3.15       The revision in the accounting policies has resulted in the following improvements in the&#13;
accounting principles adopted by EVN:&#13;
(a)   EVN and its subsidiaries now use the accrual basis of accounting;&#13;
(b)   Remittance to the Government of regular depreciation and depreciation of fully written-off&#13;
assets has been discontinued. The EVN group now employs uniform capitalization and&#13;
depreciation policies and adopts appropriate depreciation rates on each asset consistently;&#13;
(c)   Foreign currency denominated balances are now restated at the end of each reporting&#13;
period with the resulting gains or losses recognized for that period;&#13;
(d)  Cash flow statements will now be prepared at the end of each entity's financial year.&#13;
Consequently, a consolidated cash flow statement of EVN will also be presented;&#13;
(e)   The business units are now required to mnaintain their own books of accounts and submit&#13;
regular financial and non-financial reports to the Management Board for review and&#13;
consolidation of accounts; and&#13;
(f)   Consolidated accounts will be prepared for EVN and the dependent business units on a&#13;
monthly basis and EVN  and the independent business units quarterly.  During&#13;
consolidation of accounts, all intercompany transactions are eliminated.&#13;
3.16       While the aforemnentioned changes are encouraging, certain practices, however, are still at&#13;
variance with internationally accepted accounting principles and practices. Thus:&#13;
(a)   There is no external or internal audit of EVN accounts. The consolidated accounts of&#13;
EVN and its independent business units are only submitted to MOF for approval;&#13;
(b)  EVN is not allowed to make provisions for doubtful accounts. The current practice is that&#13;
the distribution companies submit a list of long overdue accounts to the Management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
Board for review. Write-offs will only be made upon approval of the Board and MOF.&#13;
In the meantime, no allowance is provided for these doubtful accounts;&#13;
(c)   Differences between the result of the physical count and the book balances of inventories&#13;
at the end of the year are recognized as balance sheet items instead of being taken directly&#13;
to income. This practice results in a misstatement of the balance sheet and profit and loss&#13;
accounts; and&#13;
(d)   The consolidated balance sheet of EVN does not properly account for construction work in&#13;
progress.  Fixed assets are not classified into assets in operation and assets under&#13;
construction in progress.&#13;
3.17       The deviations mentioned above are not of a serious nature and EVN's accounting&#13;
practices are now, for the most part, consistent with international accounting standards. The ADB&#13;
consulting study (para. 3.19), which is expected to be completed in early 1996, should assist EVN in&#13;
improving the systemic and qualitative presentation of the financial statements.&#13;
3.18       EVN is required to conform to the accounting manual of MOE and MOF and has adopted,&#13;
for all its business units, uniform accounting policies and procedures, documentation of transactions,&#13;
and charts of accounts. Its business units now prepare and submit standard accounting and other&#13;
financial reports. EVN's Business-Finance Department reviews the reports prior to submission to the&#13;
Management Board for consolidation. EVN's computerized accounting system was developed by&#13;
computer specialists from the three power companies, PCs 1, 2 and 3. While currently in use, the&#13;
program is still under evaluation and improvements are introduced as necessary. The business units all&#13;
have their own accounting departments and the accounting staff are generally competent.&#13;
3.19       PCI, PC2, PC3, HCMC and Hanoi Distribution Companies maintain a comprehensive&#13;
accounting system. These business units also have their own Electronic Data Processing Departments&#13;
acting as computer service centers for all their other departments. Other business units, which have not&#13;
yet computerized their accounts, are currently evaluating the systems in place. EVN is aware of the&#13;
need to adopt modern management practices and improve financial reporting within the group.&#13;
Eventually, a plan to computerize all significant accounting systems within EVN will be implemented.&#13;
The ADB study on "Improvement of Financial and Accounting System of the Power Companies in Viet&#13;
Nam" aimed at introducing a modem accounting and management information system, and the study on&#13;
"Power Sector Institutional Strengthening" under PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN) aimed at improving and&#13;
modernizing the commercial systems and institutional strengthening of the power sector, should assist&#13;
EVN in carrying out some of the important reforms and restructuring necessary.&#13;
Reporting and Management Information System&#13;
3.20       The guidelines for EVN's project development and procedures, accounting systems and&#13;
practices, infornation reporting, approval process and decision-making are extensive and reflect&#13;
prinarily a "top down" centralized approach to management control and decision-making. The reason&#13;
for the top-heavy decisior2 making seems to be lingering doubts as to the extent to which delegation to&#13;
the business units can be justified. The management reporting system has evolved primarily in response&#13;
to existing external reporting requirements and is used by the Government and EVN for strict&#13;
monitoring of the business units. Information is exchanged within EVN through written reports and the&#13;
computer network. Access to financial data is highly restricted and centralized. The ADB and IDA-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
supported studies referred in para. 3.19 will address this issue and should help EVN decentralize and&#13;
improve the management of and operational relationship between the business units.&#13;
Audit&#13;
3.21       Auditing capability in Viet Nam has developed significantly over the past two years. Six&#13;
international accounting firms now have self-sufficient in-country practices. Three have been licensed&#13;
to operate independently in Viet Nam, while three operate as joint ventures with local firms. In&#13;
addition, there are five strictly local firms, which are state-owned enterprises. Operating under the&#13;
supervision of MOF, they are expected to compete and be financially self-sufficient. While two of&#13;
these local firms are joint venture entities with foreign accounting firms, they also operate separate&#13;
entities under their own namnes. Recently, MOF has also established a certification program for local&#13;
accountants, with technical assistance from the European Economic Union.&#13;
3.22       Currently, there is no independent external audit of Government entities in Viet Nam.&#13;
EVN has no Internal Auditing Department nor are there plans to create one. The Government does not&#13;
require the annual financial statements of the consolidated EVN and the independent business units to be&#13;
published or audited by independent auditors. The consolidated financial accounts of EVN will be&#13;
submnitted to MOE, MOF and the Tax Department for review and approval. MOF audits are used to&#13;
determine tax liabilities, scheduled payments of "state-rented" capital, and other financial matters. IDA&#13;
is advising MOF in initiating work under an Institutional Development Fund grant for improving Viet&#13;
Namn's audit capacity that will represent the first important steps toward designing and implementing&#13;
modem govemmental accounting and financial importation systems. At negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached with EVN that it would appoint independent auditors acceptable to IDA and that an audit report&#13;
in a form acceptable to IDA would be made available to IDA within nine months after the close of each&#13;
financial year.&#13;
Taxes and Insurance&#13;
3.23       EVN is subject to the following major taxes: (a) tax on revenues (turnover tax) levied at&#13;
8% of power sales; (b) royalty tax at 2% on the use of water for hydro generation and calculated on the&#13;
basis of share of revenues from power sales generated from hydro against total generation; (c) capital&#13;
tax at 2.4% of government capital; and (d) income tax on net profit at 25%.&#13;
3.24       Unless otherwise provided by law or by MOE, EVN does not carry any insurance&#13;
protection for its assets and their contents. EVN does not also have either property or liability&#13;
insurance arrangements. Only company vehicles, as mandated by law, are insured. EVN is aware of&#13;
the IDA requirement for provision of insurance for assets financed by IDA and that insurance could be&#13;
obtained from external insurers or be effected through specific internal insurance funds of individual&#13;
business units or a common EVN fund. Agreement was reached during negotiations that EVN would&#13;
make provisions, satisfactory to IDA, for insurance against such risks and in such amounts consistent&#13;
with appropriate practice.&#13;
Budgd Arrangements&#13;
3.25       The existing budget process is designed to support applications by state-owned enterprises&#13;
for funds from the governnent budget and to provide the Government with a tool to exercise tight&#13;
financial control. Each business unit of EVN is required to submit an annual revenue and expenditure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
budget and a five-year budget by September. These budgets are submnitted to the General Director, who&#13;
presents the annual budget to the Management Board for approval. The five-year plan for the period&#13;
1996-2000 is currently being prepared and will be proposed to the Prime Minister for approval. EVN&#13;
will review the financial performance of the business units and will compare it with the annual budget&#13;
for the purpose of granting bonuses to the units. The bonuses will be in the form of cash although no&#13;
definite criteria has been set by EVN with regard to the level and funding for them. The budget&#13;
process of EVN would be reviewed by the Power Sector Institutional Strengthening Study under PSREP&#13;
(Credit No. 2724-VN).&#13;

Chapter IV&#13;
The Project&#13;
A. Objectives and Description&#13;
4.1        The main objectives of the proposed project are to: (a) help meet the rapid growth in&#13;
electricity demand in the south of Viet Nam through the addition of new gas-fired generating capacity;&#13;
(b) strengthen the high voltage (HV) transformation capacity in Viet Nam; (c) assist the Government in&#13;
introducing private power in the country; (d) strengthen the institutional capability of EVN through&#13;
technical assistance and training; and (e) assist in the formulation of a national strategy and master plan&#13;
for rural electrification. The achievement of project objectives would be monitored during and after&#13;
project implementation through specific project performance indicators (para. 4.20).&#13;
Project Description&#13;
4.2        The proposed project would cover: (a) the installation of 2x150 MW gas turbines for the&#13;
450 MW Phu My 2, Phase-1 (PHMY2-1), Combined Cycle (CC) power block; (b) addition of about&#13;
900 MVA of HV transformation capacity at existing sub-stations in the South of Viet Nam and about&#13;
1,350 MVA of such capacity in other parts of the country; (c) resettlement and compensation of persons&#13;
affected by PHMY2-l; and (d) consulting services for: (i) project design and supervision for PHMY2-1&#13;
CC power block; (ii) development of a BOT-JYV type of arrangement for the Phu My 2, Phase-2&#13;
(PHMY2-2) CC power block on the basis of competitive bidding; (iii) technical assistance and training&#13;
for EVN managerial staff; (iv) master plan for rural electrification; and (v) technical studies for the Dai&#13;
Ninh hydropower project. In addition, technical assistance for development of the legal and regulatory&#13;
framework for the power sector would be provided by the ESMAP group of the World Bank.&#13;
Description of The Project Components&#13;
Phu Mv Power Station&#13;
4.3        The Phu My Power Station would be located in Phu My village, Ba Ria-Vung Tau&#13;
province in South Viet Nam. The site is about 600 mneters from the Thai Vai River which would be the&#13;
source of cooling water for the power station. The first phase of the Phu My development (PHMY1)&#13;
would comprise 3x200 MW conventional gas/oil fired power units financed by the OECF of Japan.&#13;
This phase is expected to be conmmissioned in 1998. The second phase of the Phu My development&#13;
(PHMY2) would comprise 2x450 MW gas-fired CC power blocks. The two 150 MW internal&#13;
combustion turbines (GTs) of the first block (PHMY2-1), which constitute the proposed project and&#13;
which are being constructed on a fast-track basis, would be commnissioned by end-1996; the full CC&#13;
block would be functional by 1998. The second 450 MW CC block (PHMY2-2) is expected to be&#13;
commissioned in 1998199. A detailed feasibility study for PHMY2 was prepared by the Power&#13;
Investigation and Design Company No 2 (PI)C2) and was reviewed and updated by consultants, ESBI&#13;
of Ireland. The study has been approved by EVN and the State Appraisal Committee and is acceptable&#13;
to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
Gas Supplv for the Phu MY Power Station&#13;
4.4       In the near term (1997-1998), gas supply for Phu My would be available from the off-&#13;
shore Bach Ho associated gas field. Petro Viet Nam (PVN) would arrange to install gas compressors&#13;
which would increase the capacity of the existing pipe line from Bach Ho to the Ba Ria power station to&#13;
109-128 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD) by the middle of 1997. This would be sufficient to meet&#13;
the gas requirement of about 56 MMCFD for the 2x150 MW GTs of PHMY2-1, about 38 MMCFD for&#13;
the gas turbines at the Ba Ria power station and about 30 MMCFD for the liquified petroleum gas&#13;
(LPG) plant. For a period of about six months after commissioning (end-1996 to mid-1997), the 2x150&#13;
MW GTs of PHMY2-1 would use distillate. The natural gas reserves of Bach Ho would suffice only&#13;
for a period of about five years. The price of natural gas from the Bach Ho field, following&#13;
commissioning of the compressors, has been fixed by the Government at US$2 per MMBTU.&#13;
4.5       In the long-term, PHMY2-2 will have to use gas from the off-shore Nam Con Son Basin&#13;
(Block 6), which is expected to be available on-shore at Vung Tau by the end of 1998. The participants&#13;
in Block 6 gas are, British Petroleum (BP) (30% stake), Statoil of Norway (15% stake), and Oil and&#13;
Natural Gas Commission of India (ONGC) (55% stake). At the present time, PVN (which has an&#13;
option to take a 5% stake in field development) is the owner of the gas since the existing Production&#13;
Sharing Agreement (PSC), which is for oil, has yet to be renegotiated with the participants in regard to&#13;
the gas discovery. The feasibility study for the 375 km mid-stream gas pipeline is currently under&#13;
progress by British Petroleum (BP), Statoil, Mobil and PVN. The pipeline would be constructed&#13;
through international competitive bidding. Evaluation of the Nam Con Son gas reserves (estimated at&#13;
around 2 trillion cubic feet (TCF)) has been completed by BP and Statoil and by PVN. The gas&#13;
reserves have subsequently been certified by an independent body, the National Natural Resources&#13;
Committee of Viet Nam. The Nam Con Son gas reserves would be enough to fire as much as 2,400&#13;
MW of CC capacity for 20 years. The price of Nam Con Son gas has yet to be determined, but is&#13;
expected to be in the range of US$2.5 to 3.5 per MMBTU.&#13;
4.6        The gas from Block 6 is earmarked for: (a) PHMYI - 3x200MW, to be financed by&#13;
OECF of Japan; (b) PHMY2-1 - 450 MW, being constructed by EVN; (c) PHMY2-2 - 450/600MW,&#13;
which would be constructed through a BOT type arrangement; and (d) PHMY3 - 600/900 MW, which&#13;
would be constructed by BP through a BOT type arrangement. EVN needs to conclude a Gas Supply&#13;
Agreement (GSA) for PHMY1, PHMY2-1 and Ba Ria (total 180-190 MMCFD for 20 years) with the&#13;
owner and developer of the gas. The GSAs for PHMY2-2 and PHMY3 would be concluded by the&#13;
BOT developers.&#13;
4.7        The estimated cost of development of the Nam Con Son gas systen is about US$760&#13;
mnillion, comprising: (a) US$150 million for Lan Tay field development; (b) US$180 million for&#13;
compression platform for Lan Tay, 7-9 years down the line; (c) US$100 million for Lan Do field&#13;
development; and (d) US$330 million for the trunkline to shore and terminal. Several ownership&#13;
structures are currently being explored for the construction and operation of the pipeline. The minimum&#13;
gas supply required to make the pipeline and field development economically viable, is estimated by BP&#13;
to be about 150 MMCFD.&#13;
4.8        Agreement was reached at negotiations that EVN will enter into contractual arrangements&#13;
by no later than December 31, 1996, for gas supply to PHMY2-1 for a period of at least 20 years.&#13;
Further, (a) receipt by IDA of certification of gas reserves for Namn Con Son, satisfactory to IDA; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
(b) EVN entering into contractual arrangements for gas supply to PHMY2-1 for a period of at least five&#13;
years, are conditions for effectiveness of the IDA Credit.&#13;
Addition of HV Transformation CapacitY&#13;
4.9        EVN has done a detailed analysis of the transformer capacity and the forecast demand&#13;
(1995-2000) at each of its existing HV (66, 110 and 220 kV) sub-stations. Most of these sub-stations&#13;
not only do not have firm transformer capacity, but are operating near (and in some cases above) their&#13;
name plate ratings. This situation is a cause for alarm and augmentation of transformer capacity at&#13;
these sub-stations is imminent. Twenty-three sub-stations in the South of Viet Nam and 28 sub-stations&#13;
in the rest of Viet Nam, where the need for additional transforming capacity (based on current loading&#13;
and forecast demand) is most urgent, are listed in Annex 5. A total of about 2,250 MVA of&#13;
transforming capacity (900 MVA in the south and 1,350 MVA in the rest of Viet Nam) together with&#13;
the associated switching and control facilities are proposed to be installed under the project.&#13;
Consulting Services: (a) CC Block of PHMY2-1: Desien and Project Management: and (b) Dai Ninh&#13;
Hydropower: Technical Studies&#13;
4.10       Provision has been made in the project for about 350 staff-months (SM) of consulting&#13;
services to assist in engineering, design, procurement and construction supervision for the CC Block of&#13;
PHMY2-1. As this project component has to be implemented on a fast track basis, EVN has appointed&#13;
ESBI of Ireland as consultants, on a sole source basis, for the two GTs of PHMY2-1 for about 160 SM.&#13;
This is acceptable to IDA as ESBI (selected on a competitive basis for the Ba Ria CC power plant under&#13;
PSREP) are already in Viet Nam and are fully familiar with the requirements of PHMY2-1. It would&#13;
also be impossible to meet the extremely tight project schedule if EVN were to embark on a new&#13;
selection process. Consulting services for the steam cycle of PHMY2-1, amounting to about 190 SM,&#13;
would be procured following the Bank's procedures for the selection of consultants. EVN has adequate&#13;
in-house capability to undertake engineering, design, procurement and construction supervision for the&#13;
transformer reinforcement proposed to be undertaken under the project and hence, no provisiorn has&#13;
been made for external consulting services for this project component.&#13;
4.11       A provision of US$2.0 million has been made in the project for consulting assistance of&#13;
about 130 SM for technical studies associated with the Dai Ninh Hydropower project which is currently&#13;
under preparation as a prospective IDA-assisted project for FY97. These consulting services would be&#13;
engaged following the Bank's procedures for the selection of consultants.&#13;
Technical Assistance for Development of PHMY2-2 on Build. Operate. Transfer-Joint Venture (BOT-&#13;
JV) Basis&#13;
4.12       The main objectives of this technical assistance (TA) would be to: (a) review the&#13;
Govermnent's overall private sector policy and legal framework vis-a-vis development, ownership, and&#13;
operation of private power projects; (b) recommend the necessary legal and incentive framework for the&#13;
implementation of power generation projects by the private sector in Viet Nam; (c) develop the&#13;
solicitation package for PHMY2-2 (including selection criteria and security package) and evaluate the&#13;
proposals; and (d) assist the Govermment in contract negotiations and executing the contract with the&#13;
selected project sponsor. The terms of reference for this TA are at Annex 6. Agreement was reached&#13;
at negotiations that EVN would develop PHMY2-2 through a BOT-JV type of arrangement following a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
competitive bidding process and would engage TA for this exercise according to terms of reference&#13;
agreed with IDA.&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training for EVN&#13;
4.13       PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN) provides for TA directed at institutional strengthening,&#13;
focusing on the development of appropriate organizational structures, adoption of commercial&#13;
management practices, budget and control systems, reporting procedures and information flows, under&#13;
the reformed sector structure.  This TA is currently under implementation.  It is envisaged that&#13;
considerable resources (in terms of advisory services, computer hardware and software) would be&#13;
required in the strengthening of EVN management, including training of staff, following the&#13;
reconrmendations of the aforementioned TA. The proposed project provides for about 18 SM of in-&#13;
country consulting assistance, about 6 SMs of staff training and about US$100,000 worth of computer&#13;
hardware and software. The terms of reference for the proposed TA would be drafted after completion&#13;
of the first TA. Agreement was reached at negotiations that following completion of the TA under the&#13;
PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN), and taking into account its recommnendations, EVN would discuss and&#13;
agree with IDA the requirements for further TA and training and implement such TA and training&#13;
according to a plan and schedule to be agreed with IDA.&#13;
Technical Assistance for Master Plan for Rural Electrification&#13;
4.14       Extension of electrification to rural areas in the past has been dictated primarily by the&#13;
need for agricultural pumping. To achieve a more widespread improvement in the living standards of&#13;
the rural population, the Government has set specific targets for per capita electricity consumption to&#13;
the year 2020 in various rural areas of the country. As costs of extensive rural electrification (RE)&#13;
become increasingly higher, the Government would need to optimize its limited resources and undertake&#13;
RE in the most cost effective manner. This would require development of a master plan that lays down&#13;
policies, strategies and criteria for meeting provincial rural area development priorities. There are a&#13;
number of technical, financial and institutional issues that would need to be addressed including: (a)&#13;
inadequate transmission and distribution networks, poor power supply reliability and poor loading&#13;
characteristics in rural areas; (b) scarcity of investment capital, subsidized pricing practices, inadequate&#13;
private investment mechanisms and underdeveloped domestic equipment enterprises; and (c) lack of&#13;
locally based institutions to manage and operate grid-connected and/or isolated rural electric networks.&#13;
The main objectives of the rural electrification master plan study would be to define: (a) appropriate&#13;
regulatory, institutional and financing frameworks; (b) methodologies for forecasting and economic&#13;
evaluation of alternative supply locations and options; and (c) technical standards of design, construction&#13;
and operation. The terms of reference for the study are at Annex 7. Agreement was reached at&#13;
negotiations that EVN would undertake a master plan study of rural electrification according to terms of&#13;
reference agreed with IDA, review with IDA the reconunendations of the study and fornulate a rural&#13;
electrification mnaster plan and implementation program consistent with the reconmmendations of the&#13;
study.&#13;
Technical Assistance for Le2al and Regulatory Framework&#13;
4.15       This TA would be a follow up on the TA on "Power Sector Reform and Restructuring"&#13;
that was provided by ESMAP in association with PSREP (Credit No. 2427-VN). The main objective of&#13;
the proposed TA (which would also be funded by ESMAP) is to assist the Government in identifying&#13;
the issues and options in creating a legal and regulatory framework for the power sector that would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
conducive to private sector participation. The terms of reference for this TA, which would include&#13;
drafting of an Electricity Law and a Grid Code, are given in Annex 8. Agreement was reached at&#13;
negotiations that EVN would review with IDA the recommnendations )f this TA and thereafter take&#13;
measures, mutually acceptable to IDA and the Borrower, for implementing the regulatory framework&#13;
and the Grid Code and take further actions in passing the Electricity Law.&#13;
B. Implementation&#13;
4.16       EVN, through its appropriate business units, would have full responsibility for&#13;
implementing the physical components of the project, including the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for&#13;
Phu My. MOE (now MOI) and EVN would be responsible for managing the TA associated with the&#13;
project's policy aspects. Steering committees would be formed and representatives from relevant line&#13;
ministries would be involved in the development of the legal and regulatory framework and in the&#13;
solicitation of private power proposals. For managing the implementation of large thermal power&#13;
projects in the south of Viet Nam EVN has established the Phu My Ba Ria Management Board&#13;
(PMBRMB). PMBRMB will be responsible for implementing the PHMY2-1 component of the project.&#13;
For managing the implementation of high voltage transmission lines and sub-stations in the south, north&#13;
and center of Viet Nam, respectively, EVN has established Management Boards of the Power Projects&#13;
for the Southern, Northern and Central Regions (MBPPSR, MBPPNR and MBPPCR). These Boards&#13;
will be responsible for irnplementing the transformer augmentation component of the project falling in&#13;
their respective regions. The organization charts of the PMBRMB and the MBPPSR, MBPPNR and&#13;
MBPPCR and the project management units created by them for implementation of the project&#13;
comnponents are shown in Charts 4 and 5. Most of the personnel of these Boards have been drawn from&#13;
the erstwhile power companies and have adequate experience in technical and managerial aspects of&#13;
project implernentation. PMBRMB will employ consultants for assistance in engineering, design, bid&#13;
evaluation and construction supervision of the PHMY2-1 project component (para. 4.10). The 2x150&#13;
MW GTs of PHMY2-1 will be installed under a single responsibility supply and erection contract.&#13;
MBPPSR, MBPPNR and MBPPCR have substantial in-house expertise in engineering, design,&#13;
procuremnent and construction supervision for installation of transformers and no external consulting&#13;
assistance is required (para. 4.9). This project component will be installed by local contractors under&#13;
the supervision of staff of the respective Boards and with supervision services from foreign contractors&#13;
for the installation of major equipment like transformers and circuit breakers. Bid documents following&#13;
the Bank guidelines were prepared by consultants for PHMY2-1; the bids were received in September&#13;
1995 and contract award has been made. Bid documents for some of the transformer installations have&#13;
also been issued. Bidding Evaluation Committees (having representation from the MOI) have been set&#13;
up for evaluating bids and approving contract awards.&#13;
4.17       EVN has prepared a Project Implementation Plan in line with Bank guidelines (Annex 19,&#13;
Ref. 1). The bar charts for implementing the various project components are given in Charts 2 and 3.&#13;
Most of the project would be implemented over the 1996-1997 period. Vietnamese institutions are&#13;
technically well experienced in implementing the project components and with the consulting assistance&#13;
provided under the project for PMHY2-1, no substantive problems are foreseen in efficient and timely&#13;
implementation of the project. The implementing arrangements are satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
4.18       Satisfactory procedures for monitoring the progress of the project in terms of physical&#13;
execution and financial reports were agreed with EVN, at negotiations. It was also agreed that EVN&#13;
will furnish quarterly progress reports. An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be drafted by&#13;
IDA not later than six months after completion of the Credit and agreement was reached with EVN to&#13;
assist in its preparation. EVN will adopt the plan for the operational phase of the project. EVN will&#13;
also prepare and make available to IDA its own evaluation report, including a summary report which&#13;
will be attached unedited to the ICR. The evaluation would assess the project execution and initial&#13;
operation, its costs and benefits, IDA's performance, its own performance of the obligations under the&#13;
Credit Agreement, and the extent to which the purposes of the Credit were achieved.&#13;
Supervision Plan and Key Performance Indicators for Project Monitoring&#13;
4.19       Supervision of this project will extend over a period of three years, 1996-1998. The key&#13;
issues that would be focused upon are: (a) review of Viet Nan's power development plan in keeping&#13;
with changes in the economic scenario; (b) a continuing dialogue with the Government on tariffs for the&#13;
power sector; (c) monitoring of compliance with financial covenants to assure the financial health of the&#13;
sector while undertaking large investment programs; (d) monitoring of the implementation of the&#13;
environmental impact mitigation measures and resettlement plans for PHMY2-1; and (e) technical&#13;
supervision of physical implementation of the project components. The IDA missions, accompanied&#13;
with ESMAP as necessary, would also assist the Government in: (a) legal and regulatory framework&#13;
issues for the power sector; (b) realizing a BOT-JV type of arrangement for PHMY2-2; (c) institutional&#13;
strengthening of EVN; and (d) development of strategies and master plan for rural electrification.&#13;
Supervision of the project would require expertise in power engineering, economics, financial analysis,&#13;
power sector regulation and private power development, and resettlement. Three missions annually for&#13;
a period of three years (normally coinciding with preparatory missions for ongoing and future IDA-&#13;
assisted projects) are foreseen for adequate supervision of this project. The total estimated staff inputs&#13;
are: (a) power engineer, economist and financial analyst - 24 staff-weeks; (b) environmental impact&#13;
assessment and rehabilitation - 4 staff weeks; and (c) regulatory framework and private power&#13;
development - 15 staff-weeks (see Annex 9 for details).&#13;
4.20       Key project performance indicators that would be used for monitoring and supervision are&#13;
given in Annex 9. These performance indicators are closely linked to the project objectives spelled out&#13;
in para. 4.1. The targets for some of the performance indicators have been defined, while targets for&#13;
others would be developed, early during implementation. In addition to the perfomiance indicators,&#13;
target dates have been defined to monitor: (a) commissioning of PHMY2-1 on schedule to ensure that&#13;
there is no load shedding in the south; (b) availability of gas by mid-1997 so that PHMY2-2 turbines do&#13;
not bum costly distillate fuel for more than six months; (c) taking of timely steps by EVN towards&#13;
development of PHMY2-2 on a BOT-JV basis; and (d) timely completion of the TA on legal and&#13;
regulatory framework for the power sector and the process of subsequent decisions on its incorporation.&#13;

C. Environment and Resettlement&#13;
Phu My Power Project&#13;
Environmental Impacts&#13;
4.21       A detailed environmental impact assessment (EIA) (Annex 19, Ref. 2), which takes into&#13;
account the 3x200 MW conventional power plants of PHMY1 and the 2x450 MW CC power blocks of&#13;
PHMY2, has concluded that with proper design and mitigation measures, atmospheric impacts (NO.,&#13;
SO, and noise levels) and aquatic impacts (cooling water temperature, chlorine concentration and impact&#13;
on shrimp farming and mangroves) would be within acceptable limits.  A summary of main&#13;
environmental impacts and mitigation measures is presented in Annex 10. The EIA has been approved&#13;
by the Governrnent. It was agreed during negotiations that EVN would: (a) design the PHMY2-1 plant&#13;
to meet specified environmental requirements and adopt appropriate mitigation measures; and (b) set up&#13;
an environmental unit and an environmental coordinator as part of the management structure of the&#13;
power station.&#13;
Resettlement&#13;
4.22       About 18 ha of land are being acquired by PMBRMB for the overall PHMY2&#13;
development, which would accommodate the 450 MW block of PHMY2-1, whose GTs are being&#13;
financed under the project, and the future 450 MW block of PHMY2-2. About 63% of the area is&#13;
covered with cashew trees, about 30% comprises other tree crops and the remaining 7% is fallow land.&#13;
The total number of families that would be affected by the PHMY2 development is 55 of which 9&#13;
(currently residing on the right-of-way of the transmission line) will need to be resettled and the&#13;
remaining 46 compensated and rehabilitated. A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared for&#13;
the 55 families that would be affected by the project (see Annex 11 for details). The principles of that&#13;
RAP would also apply for resettlement/compensation of people affected by future phases of&#13;
development at the Phu My site. The project affected persons (PAPs) will be relocated, as far as&#13;
possible, close to their present location in order to ensure that their socio-economic lifestyles will not be&#13;
affected. The form of compensation for land will be "land for land", unless PAPs specifically insist on&#13;
cash compensation. PAP's opting for cash compensation would be given a choice between land-based&#13;
and non-land based rehabilitation. Compensation will be paid at replacement cost for houses and&#13;
structures and at market rates for trees and crops. The RAP will be implemented by PMBRMB with&#13;
the involvement of PAPs and the peoples' committees at the district and commune levels. Adequate&#13;
mechanisms have been provided for the redressal of grievances and for external and internal supervision&#13;
and monitoring. The RAP is in compliance with the Bank's operational directives and is acceptable to&#13;
IDA. The RAP was agreed with the Government at negotiations. It was also agreed at negotiations&#13;
that EVN would carry out the RAP as approved by the Government and accepted by IDA.&#13;
Installation of Transformers&#13;
4.23       All transformers and their associated switchgear will be installed in existing substations&#13;
which have been in operation for several years. Hence, no acquisition of new land would be necessary&#13;
and thus there would be no persons affected by this project component. An environmental analysis&#13;
pertaining to the installation of transformers at sub-stations is given in Annex 12. No PCB is used in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
the transformers in Viet Narn and none would be used for the transformers that would be installed&#13;
under the project&#13;
D. Cost Estimates&#13;
4.24       The total cost of the project (including capitalized interest during construction) is estimated&#13;
at US$242 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$180 million. The cost estimates for the&#13;
gas turbines for PHMY2-1 are based on bids already received. The cost estimates for the transformers&#13;
and associated switchgear are based on contracts recently placed for such equipment in Viet Nam.&#13;
Physical contingencies are assumed at 10% of the base cost for all project components. Price&#13;
contingencies are estimated on the basis of escalation factors of 6% per annum for local cost&#13;
components and 2.2% per annum for foreign cost components, following the Bank's latest forecasts.&#13;
Table 4.1 summarizes the cost estimates for the project (details are at Annex 13).&#13;
E. Financing Plan&#13;
4.25       The financing plan for the project is shown in Table 4.2. The proposed IDA credit of&#13;
US$180 million equivalent would meet 100% of the foreign cost of the project and about 74% of&#13;
project financing requirements. The proposed IDA credit would be made to the Govermnent at IDA's&#13;
standard rate for a 40 year term including 5 years of grace on repayment of principal. The Credit&#13;
would be onlent to EVN in US dollars at a fixed interest rate of 6.9% per annum, with repayment over&#13;
20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and foreign exchange risk being borne by EVN. The&#13;
finalization of subsidiary loan agreement between the Govemrnment and EVN, acceptable to IDA, would&#13;
be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit.&#13;

F. Procurement&#13;
4.26         About 94.5%  (US$170 million equivalent) of the IDA credit would be used for financing&#13;
goods procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) using the Bank guidelines.  In the&#13;
evaluation of bids obtained following ICB procedures, a margin of preference equal to 15% of the CIF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
bid price of imported goods or the actual customs duties and import taxes, whichever is less, will be&#13;
allowed for domestic manufactures. About 3.5% (US$6.5 million equivalent) of the credit amount&#13;
would be used for financing consulting services and TA procured following the Bank procedures for the&#13;
employment of consultants. Consulting services for the two GTs of PHMY2-1 amounting to about&#13;
US$2.0 million equivalent have been procured on sole source basis (para. 4.10). About 0.5% (US$1.0&#13;
million equivalent) of the credit would be used for financing specialized equipment (including testing&#13;
and measuring equipment, computer hardware and software) using the following procedures complying&#13;
with the Bank guidelines: (a) Limited International Bidding (LIB), aggregating US$0.5 million&#13;
equivalent; and (b) International Shopping (IS) aggregating USS0.5 million equivalent. Contracts under&#13;
these procedures would not exceed the equivalent of US$200,000 each for LIB and US$50,000 each for&#13;
IS.&#13;
4.27       The bid documents would follow the text of the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents. All&#13;
bid documents, contract award recommendations and contracts for goods and services would be subject&#13;
to prior review and approval by IDA. The total number of procurement packages is foreseen to be: (a)&#13;
ICB - 8 packages (Annex 14); and (b) LIB and IS - about 5 packages. A total of about 660 staff-&#13;
months of consulting services will be engaged under 6 contracts.&#13;
4.28       Civil and installation work for transformer additions would be contracted to local finns&#13;
through a competitive bidding process satisfactory to IDA. Such local contracts would not be financed&#13;
from the IDA credit.&#13;
4.29       Table 4.3 summarizes the procurement arrangements for the components expected to be&#13;
financed out of the proposed IDA credit.&#13;
G. Disbursements&#13;
4.30       The IDA credit would be disbursed against: (a) 100% of foreign expenditures, or 100% of&#13;
local expenditures (ex-factory cost) for items procured through ICB; (b) 50% of local expenditures for&#13;
other items procured locally; and (c) 100% of expenditures for consulting services, excluding taxes.&#13;
Statement of Expenditures (SOE) procedures would be followed for consultancy contracts below&#13;
US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals. To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account&#13;
would be established in US currency for EVN on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA with a&#13;
deposit of US$3.0 million. Replenishment applications would be submitted monthly or when the&#13;
account is drawn by 30% of the authorized allocation, whichever occurs first. For withdrawal outside&#13;
of the Special Account (applications for direct payment or for issuance of Special Commitments) a&#13;
minimum application value of 30% of the authorized allocation of the Special Account would be&#13;
observed.&#13;
4.31       Retroactive financing would be permitted to the extent of US$15.0 million equivalent for&#13;
payments made, prior to the date of the Credit Agreement but after October 1, 1995 (the appraisal&#13;
starting date), for contracting urgently required goods and consulting services. This is necessary to&#13;
meet the project implementation schedule.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
4.32          Annex 15 gives the disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA credit and the standard&#13;
profile of disbursements for power projects in Asia. This is a fast track project and the Credit is&#13;
assumed to be disbursed about two years faster than the profile, based on actual performance of Viet&#13;
Nam on other power projects and the preparatory work already undertaken. The project is expected to&#13;
be completed by June 30, 1999 and the closing date for the credit would be December 31, 1999.&#13;

5.1          Since 1990 the power companies (PCs) were allowed by the Govermment to manage and&#13;
utilize their resources "paying attention to high rates of return" and to continuously accumulate finds&#13;
for the Government and themselves."  Key performance figures of PCI, PC2 and PC3 for 1994 are&#13;

Note: All figures are in Dong billion unless otherwise noted.&#13;
5.2          The past financial results showed that the three PCs' overall financial performance,&#13;
representing the operations of the entire power sector, were satisfactory as PCI and PC2 generated&#13;
revenues sufficient to cover all their operating and maintenance expenses, including depreciation.&#13;
While PCI and PC2 indicate reasonably acceptable results, PC3's finances were seriously negative and&#13;
as an independent company, it could be considered bankrupt.&#13;
5.3          Notwithstanding the acceptable financial results related to the overall operation of the PCs,&#13;
they continue to have serious cash flow constraints. This problem, which constrains the PCs' ability to&#13;
finance their investment program, is clearly discerned from the serious weakness in the capital structure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
of the power sector. The PCs simply have not been provided with any paid-in capital nor allowed to&#13;
accumulate adequate earnings to sufficiently finance capital expenditures. The structure of the sector's&#13;
equity base consists of Government capital at D 14,533 billion (representing the non-cash residual&#13;
interest in the assets of the PCs after deducting liabilities), and accumulated profits of only D 158&#13;
billion, representing a mere 1 % of total equity. Furthermore, until 1995, the PCs were required to&#13;
remit anywhere from 30-100% of their depreciation charge to the Govermnent and to continue&#13;
depreciating and remitting fully depreciated assets. In other words, the PCs' financial constraints derive&#13;
from their balance sheets, not their income statements. With these constraints, the PCs' financial&#13;
performance and liquidity have suffered, ruining their ability not only to maintain existing assets but&#13;
also to finance capital investments and future expansion. Without adequate retained earnings, the&#13;
financial resiliency of the power sector to withstand unexpected business crises has been greatly eroded.&#13;
5.4        To address the vulnerable condition of the PCs, particularly, PC2 and PC3, and to achieve&#13;
financial recovery, the PSREP sought a recapitalization of the PCs' equity with the aim of rebuilding,&#13;
fully funding, and strengthening the capital base. In 1994, the Government decided to discontinue the&#13;
requirement of remitting depreciation charges starting 1995. Assurances were also obtained (under IDA&#13;
Credit No. 2724-VN) that actions, including but not limited to adjustment of tariffs, would be made to&#13;
enable PC2 to generate enough internal funds to finance its investment program and to ensure viable&#13;
operations of PC3.&#13;
Financial Performance of EVN&#13;
5.5        The reorganization of the power sector in January 1995 into a corporate structure resulted&#13;
in the establishment of EVN, as holding company, and numerous subsidiaries or business units involved&#13;
in specific types of activities under it. For accounting purposes, EVN as a consolidated entity now&#13;
comprises the following dependent and independent entities:  14 power plants, four transmission&#13;
companies, five distribution companies, four construction companies, and nine peripheral units&#13;
consisting of two design companies, two conununications companies, the National Load Dispatch&#13;
Center, the Energy Institute, the Research Center, an equipment production company, and a finance&#13;
company.&#13;
5.6        Given the very recent establishment of EVN, a financial analysis of its past performance is&#13;
not meaningful. The first year of operation is 1995, when the accounts of the three formerly fully&#13;
integrated power companies, PCI, PC2 and PC3 (which were responsible for generation, transmission&#13;
and distribution in the North, South and Center, respectively), were consolidated into the accounts of&#13;
EVN.&#13;

5.8          As can be seen in the above table, EVN reported net revenues of about D 137 billion in&#13;
the first quarter of its first full year of operation. However, these figures are prelirninary and should be&#13;
treated with caution. The figures reflect accounts submitted by the various business units to EVN for&#13;
consolidation. It has been the practice of the previous power companies to submit figures that&#13;
underestimnate financial performance that would result in more fund transfers and less taxable obligations&#13;
from and to the Govermment, respectively. EVN is convinced that this is the case for the first quarter&#13;
of 1995 and it is currently discussing this issue with the independent business units on the final&#13;
numbers.&#13;

5.10          l accordance with its charter, the State assigns capital and resources to EVN, which is&#13;
also allowed to mobilize all sources of domestic and foreign funds in line with the provisions of the&#13;
State. EVN's financial objective, as defined by its charter, is to preserve and develop the assigned&#13;
capital and fulfill its financial obligations towards the State in conformity with laws. Furthermore, it is&#13;
responsible for regularly upgrading its equipment, technology and management so as to lower its cost of&#13;
production and reduce electricity losses. While the financial objectives presented are very broad, the&#13;
Institutional Strengthening Study financed under PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN) would greatly assist&#13;
EVN to define "market-oriented' financial objectives, develop financial planning systems and redefine&#13;
the process of setting performance targets for its business units.&#13;
5.11         Table 5.3 shows that EVN's assets to date have largely been financed by equity as the&#13;
power companies have not incurred any significant long term debt in the past. The long term debt&#13;
consists primarily of some term loans contracted by PC2 in 1993 from local commercial banks. Gross&#13;
Fixed Assets in Operation decreased from D 22,373 billion in 1994 to D 21,375 billion in 1995 on&#13;
account of EVN's writing off of some assets during the consolidation of its accounts in 1995. EVN's&#13;
liquidity position is satisfactory with a current ratio of 1.24 during the first quarter of 1995.&#13;
Fixed Assets Valuation and Distribution&#13;
5.12         Major portions of the fixed assets of the PCs were initially recorded at cost. Upon the&#13;
unification of Viet Nam, the PCs' assets were valued using standard unit prices, which was typical of&#13;
the system used by many centrally-planned economies. These asset values remained on the PCs' books&#13;
at cost without regard for the general development of the economy and inflation. After minor&#13;
adjustments were made in 1981, 1985 and 1989, a nationwide asset revaluation exercise was decreed by&#13;
the Government in 1990 for all industries, using the following parameters: (a) one Russian Ruble&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-&#13;
equivalent to D 2,400 for assets procured from the former Soviet Union; and (b) one US Dollar&#13;
equivalent to D 2,400 for assets procured abroad elsewhere. A second nationwide revaluation was&#13;
undertaken in January 1992 using: (a) one Russian Ruble equivalent to D 10,000 for all assets procured&#13;
from the former Soviet union; and (b) one US Dollar equivalent to D 10,000 for assets procured abroad&#13;
elsewhere. However, due to the high rates of inflation experienced in Viet Nam over the past four&#13;
years, the varying methodologies used for revaluing fixed assets, and distortions in the value of fixed&#13;
assets, it is not possible to state definitively whether the assets are properly valued. As a result,&#13;
computations of annual rates of return, can be misleading.&#13;
5.13       Upon the organization of EVN and its subsidiaries, the necessary assets that will be used&#13;
by the appropriate business units were transferred at net book value. These historical book values were&#13;
based on the 1992 revaluation exercise. The carrying costs of assets which were acquired prior to the&#13;
revaluation done in 1992 could not be determined as objective. It is therefore difficult-to determine if&#13;
the carrying costs of the assets transferred within the EVN group reflect the fair value of the assets at&#13;
the time of transfer. A revaluation of EVN's fixed assets in operation will be undertaken as part of the&#13;
ADB Study on "Improvement of Financial and Accounting Systemns of the PCs in Viet Nam". Until&#13;
this valuation exercise is concluded, the value of fixed assets presented in EVN's balance sheet as of&#13;
March 31, 1995 is used as basis for future projections. To enable continuous assessment of real&#13;
earnings to be made which in turn will help in determining the appropriate level of cash generation,&#13;
agreement was reached during negotiations that EVN will revalue its fixed assets periodically in&#13;
accordance with sound and consistently maitained methods of valuation satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
5.14       As of March 31, 1995, EVN's gross fixed assets representing generation, transmission,&#13;
distribution and other assets (except land) of the power sector, amounted to D 21,373 billion of which&#13;
D 7,218 billion was accumulated depreciation. The Hoa Binh hydroelectric plant, formerly operated by&#13;
PCI and now operated by the Hoa Binh Power Plant Company, represented the biggest asset holding&#13;
valued at more than a quarter of total EVN assets. Other substantial assets were transferred to&#13;
Transmission Company No. 1 at D 2,072 billion and to the Tri An Power Plant Company at D 1,848&#13;
billion. The new PCI and PC2 recorded asset shares at 9% and 7% of total EVN assets, respectively.&#13;
The 500 kV transmission system was transferred to Transmission Company No. 4 and the assets were&#13;
valued at D 1,094 billion.&#13;
B. Fiunicial Outlook&#13;
5.15       Projections of EVN's financial performance for the period 1995-2001 and the assumptions&#13;
underlying these projections are presented in Annexes 16 and 17. The key financial indicators are&#13;
presented in Table 5.4 below. In interpreting the ratios shown, it should be borne in mind that EVN&#13;
will become fully operational only at the end of 1995 and that there are certain outtanding financial&#13;
issues including appropriate bulk pricing arrngement, d  ion  of cost and profit centers,&#13;
unrealistic asset valuation, and the accounting variances and misstatements described in para. 3.16, that&#13;
could make conventional ratio analysis of limited value.&#13;

5.16         The future financial situation of EVN will depend heavily on the economic development of&#13;
the country and the resulting demand and sales increases, and the speed and efficiency with which EVN&#13;
will be able to develop and finance its potentially large investment program. Maintenance of a sound&#13;
revenue position for financing operations will be equally important. The assumptions used for EVN's&#13;
future finances were designed to ensure its financial viability and satisfactory financial performance. In&#13;
this context, EVN's ability to generate income adequate to meet all financial obligations on a timely&#13;
basis and to sustain an adequate level of working capital needed for continuous operations will be of&#13;
great importance. The projections also aim at developing EVN's capability to contribute to the renewal&#13;
and expansion of assets and maximizing EVN's finances by abandoning its total reliance on the&#13;
Govermnent budget and instead, using, to the extent possible, internal as well as external sources of&#13;
funds. Having these principles in mind, the financial projections are based on the parameters dealt with&#13;
below.&#13;
5.17         The Government has developed three demand scenarios: low, base and high. Over the&#13;
next few years the scenarios are not too different because financing for the generation facilities is more&#13;
or less secured and the completion of the 500 kV interconnection system provides much of the energy&#13;
required to satisfy the demand expected to materialize in the short-run. The financial projections are&#13;
based on the high case scenario with an average growth rate over 1995-2000 of around 12.8% in the&#13;
North, 16%  for the South, and 15%  for the Center or an average increase of 14.6%  for the country as&#13;
a whole. Average technical and non-technical losses currently at about 21 % of generation (of which&#13;
non-technical losses are about 3%) are projected to be maintained at 21%  until 1997 and to be gradually&#13;
reduced until the losses reach 17% in 2001.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
5.18       On the basis of these assumptions, EVN's projected financial results are satisfactory&#13;
showing that it would be able to generate revenues sufficient to cover all operating expenses (including&#13;
depreciation), as well as interest expenses and income taxes. EVN's load forecast assumes that sales&#13;
would increase from 10,676 Gwh in 1995 to 24,297 Gwh in 2001-an increase of about 15% p.a. With&#13;
projected reduction in system losses, review of the power development program, and upward adjustment&#13;
in tariffs agreed with under PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN), electricity revenues will increase by an&#13;
average of about 33% from D 6,059 billion in 1995 to D 32,714 billion in the year 2001. The&#13;
projected income statements also assumes that EVN would be able to increase tariffs by half a cent (5&#13;
USc/kWh) beginning FY96; from its current level of 5 USc/kWh, the average tariff is expected to&#13;
increase to 5.5 USc/kWh in FY96, and reach 7 USc/kWh by 1999.&#13;
5.19       EVN's operating costs are projected to increase on average by 14% annually between&#13;
FY95-2001. EVN's fuel expenses (as it puts several hydropower projects to operation and switches to&#13;
more fuel-efficient thermal plants) are expected to reduce significantly over this period. Because tariff&#13;
increases would rise faster than increases in operating costs, EVN's operating ratio is expected to&#13;
improve substantially from 92% to 38%. Consequently, operating income is expected to grow steadily&#13;
from 8% of total revenues in FY95 to 62% in FY2001. While interest expenses are projected to&#13;
escalate from D 22 billion to D 2,025 billion during the period, as EVN finances a larger portion of&#13;
future investments through loans, nevertheless, net income is calculated to rise from 6% of total&#13;
revenues in FY95 to 42% in FY2001.&#13;
5.20       The financial projections show that with reasonable tariff adjustments averaging to about&#13;
10% p.a. and allowing EVN to accumulate profits and build its cash reserves, EVN would be able to&#13;
finance about 34% of its future investment from internal sources. At negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached with EVN and the Government that EVN would take all actions including but not limited to&#13;
revision of tariffs, so that funds generated from internal sources would be equivalent to not less than&#13;
30% of the annual average of EVN's capital expenditures incurred for the financial year, the previous&#13;
financial year, and the next following financial year.&#13;
5.21       In the past, the power sector has not borrowed long term funds since all funds have been&#13;
provided through the Government budget. EVN's existing long term debt is only 2% of its debt plus&#13;
equity, however, long term debt and further borrowing would be needed to finance EVN's investment&#13;
program, which would involve large debt service payments in the coming years. The projections&#13;
assume that about two-thirds of future investments would be financed through loans and the balance&#13;
from internal cash generation. The assumptions on future financing show that no additional capital&#13;
infusion nor any contribution to the investment program would be made by the Government during the&#13;
period as it is the Government's intention that EVN becomne self-sufficient from the date of its&#13;
organization. The decision by the Government to wean the power sector into financial independence&#13;
through several steps would lay the foundation for a power sector that hopefully would be able to raise&#13;
its own funds for capital expansion.  In order to achieve satisfactory financial performance and&#13;
contribute to the renewal and expansion of assets, PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN) included contractual&#13;
obligations in the legal agreements binding PC2 and PC3 to maintain financial viability. Through these&#13;
covenants, (suitably modified following the restructuring of the power sector) IDA would monitor the&#13;
relevant PCs' financial performance and, eventually, assist them to become sufficiently creditworthy to&#13;
raise funds in the capital markets.&#13;

5.23        EVN's development program for the period 1995-1999 is huge when compared to its&#13;
modest capital expenditures of the past. It is projected at D 58,730 billion or an average annual&#13;
investment of D 11,746 billion. This is mainly due to the large capital costs of thermal and hydro&#13;
projects which account for about 43% and 40%, respectively, of the total investment program. The&#13;
hydro generation program includes investments in the future projects in Ban Mai (D 2,105 billion), Son&#13;
La (D 4,745 billion), Yali (D 4,907 billion), Plei Kron (D 1,581 billion), and Ham Thuan Da Mi (D&#13;
4,779 billion). Thermal generation includes investments in three major plants: Pha Lai (D 8,484&#13;
billion), Quang Ninh (D 1,674 billion) and Phu My (D 8,880 billion). The value of EVN's net fixed&#13;
assets in operations and its revalued rate base at the end of the period are projected to increase to about&#13;
1.9 timnes their 1995 levels.&#13;
5.24        To finance this substantial investment program, EVN would secure long term financing,&#13;
net of debt service, of about D 17,766 billion of projected 1995-1999 investments. These borrowings&#13;
represent an adequate capital structure with long term debt not exceeding 40% of total capitalization for&#13;
the projected period. EVN is expected to finance the balance from internally generated funds and&#13;
achieve a significant level of self financing averaging about 35 % throughout the period.&#13;
5.25        The financial projections show that with the implementation of adequate tariff increases,&#13;
the debt service coverage ratio of EVN would be between 3.3 to 82.1 during the period. The initial&#13;
years of operation would show very high debt servicing capabilities as debts repayments would not&#13;
occur until the later part of the period. With a view to maintaining debt service at acceptable levels,&#13;
agreement was reached at negotiations with EVN and the Government that EVN would not incur&#13;
additional debt unless its estimated internally generated cash, after expenditure for each year, during the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-&#13;
term of the debt to be incurred shall be at least 2.0 times its total estimated debt service requirements in&#13;
such years.&#13;
5.26       In the past, the financial constraints of the power sector (para. 5.3) stemmed from the&#13;
insufficiency of its equity capital. While the Government's policy is to no longer make any capital&#13;
contributions to EVN in order to set it up as an independent company, it must recognize that the&#13;
financial viability of EVN is well beyond EVN's control. There are problems which can negatively&#13;
influence the financial situation of EVN; if projected demand fails to materialize, if the Government is&#13;
unable or- is delayed in making the necessary tariff adjustments, if the external financing for the&#13;
investment program is not fully secured, or if other unforseen problems arises, the Government will&#13;
need to provide relief, either through new equity investments or advances or reimbursements in respect&#13;
of some portions of the investment program. At negotiations, agreements were reached that by&#13;
December of each year, EVN will review with IDA its proposed annual budgets and financial plan for&#13;
each succeeding five year period.&#13;

CHAPTER VI&#13;
Project Justification&#13;
A. Economic Analysis&#13;
6.1        Development of the power sector is crucial for the economic upliftment of Viet Nam.&#13;
Implementation of the proposed project would help ensure the country's continued economic growth in&#13;
general and of the rapidly expanding southem region, in particular. The project would make a&#13;
significant contribution towards: (a) strengthening the managerial capabilities of the power sector&#13;
entities; (b) establishing a legal and regulatory framework for the power sector, a necessary prerequisite&#13;
for the introduction of private power; and (c) achieving a BOT type arrangement in the power sector.&#13;
6.2        The project supports two crucial investments in the power sector of Viet Nam - PHMY2-1&#13;
and HV transformer additions. The acute power shortage predicted for the South from the end of 1996&#13;
makes it imperative to add generation within a short period of about 15 months. This is feasible only&#13;
with internal combustion turbines (GTs). Forunately, natural gas would be available to fuel these GTs&#13;
from mid-1997 and the use of costly diistillate oil is expected to be limited to about 6 months only.&#13;
Also, the discovery of large offshore gas reserves in the South and the expected availability of this gas&#13;
onshore by end-1998 makes gas-fired combined cycle (CC) generation an economically attractive (and&#13;
environmentally least-objectionable) option for power generation in the South. Gas-fired generation&#13;
(along with environmentally acceptable hydropower), thus, figures largely in the least-ost power&#13;
development plan for Viet Nam.&#13;
6.3        The second investment supported by the project (HIV transformer additions) is an&#13;
investment that is long overdue. Due to paucity of funds, many HV transformer substations have aeen&#13;
operating at or above their rated capacities. The consequences of overloading transformers are a loss of&#13;
life, high energy losses and unserved energy. PSREP (Credit No. 2724-VN) supports the reinforcement&#13;
of medium voltage (MV) distribution in some of the heavily loaded MV systems supplying the fast&#13;
growing areas in and around HCMC. Complementary investments in the HV system are vital to meet&#13;
the demand growth. The project supports transformer capacity augmentation at some of the critically&#13;
loaded HV substations in fast growth areas in the South as well as the most urgent capacity additions in&#13;
the HV transformier substations elsewhere in Viet Nam, especially in the North.&#13;
PHMY2&#13;
6.4        The 2x15OMW GTs of PHMY2-1 are scheduled to be commissioned by end-1996. A&#13;
detailed feasibility study by PIDC2 has established that it would be economical to convert the GTs to&#13;
CC operation for gas prices above USSI.75IMMBTU. Accordingly, the GTs would be converted to&#13;
CC operation by the installation of the associated steam cycle equipment in end-1998. The following&#13;
Base Case assurmptions are made in the economic analysis:&#13;
(a)   Costs and monetary benefits are converted to 1995 prices. Due to the liberalized nature of&#13;
the market for foreign exchange in Viet Nam, the exchange rate reflects market prices and&#13;
no adjustments are made for foreign costs. As the labor component of the project cost is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-&#13;
s -.                         only about 1 % of the total cost, no adjustment is made for the shadow wage rate&#13;
(estimated at about.0.75).&#13;
(b)   Capital cost for the GTs is US$117.4 million; this includes physical contingency of 10%;&#13;
price contingencies and duties and taxes are excluded. The capital cost for the steam cycle&#13;
to be installed at a later date is assumed to be US$7501kW.&#13;
(c)   In the Vietnamese power grid, generation accounts for about 65 % of the total investment,&#13;
transmission and distribution accounting for the balance 35%. Accordingly, the cost of&#13;
transmission and distribution associated with the project is assumed to be about US$125&#13;
million (US$35 million for transmission and US$90 million for distribution). The cost of&#13;
distribution system expansion is assumed to be spread uniformly over 7 years.&#13;
(d)   Annual O&amp;M costs as percentage of capital costs are assumed at 5% for GT, 3.5%  for&#13;
CC, 1.5% for transmission and 2.5% for distribution.&#13;
(e)   Based on the data provided by the Energy Institute, the plant is assumed to operate at an&#13;
annual plant capacity factor of 68%. The plant life is assumed to be 20 years.&#13;
(f)   The plant is assumed to use distillate for the first 6 months and natural gas thereafter.&#13;
(g)   The economnic cost of distillate is 20 USc/liter (24 USclliter with 20% tax). The econonic&#13;
price of natural gas is assumed to be the same as the expected buying price. The latter is&#13;
assumed to be in the range of US$2.5-3.5/1,000 cu. ft (Base price - US$2.5/1,000 cu.&#13;
ft.). The true economic price would be lower, but is not possible to estimate, as the basis&#13;
of gas pricing has not yet been finalized in Viet Nam.&#13;
Cn)   The net heat rates for the GTs are assumed to be 11 cu. ft./kWh for gas and 0.33&#13;
liter/kWh for distillate.&#13;
(i)   The output from the plant (derated for site conditiorLs from 150 to 130 MW) is decreased&#13;
by the level of technical losses forecast for the system (reducing from 17% in 1996 to 13&#13;
% in 2006 and remaining constant thereafter) in each year of operation; this represents the&#13;
incremental sales from the project.&#13;
(j)   The electricity tariffs are used as proxy for the evaluation of project benefits. The tariff is&#13;
assumned to increase progressively to 7 USc/kWh by 1999, in nominal terms, based on&#13;
Government's proposals.&#13;
6.5         The EIRR is estimated at about 17% (details are at Annex 18). The EIRR calculated&#13;
understates the benefits to the economy, as consumer surplus (benefit derived by consumers over and&#13;
above the price for electricity) is not included. Inclusion of consumer surplus would result in a higher&#13;
EIRR, largely independent of the tariff; a lower tariff would simply transfer the benefit from the power&#13;
comspany to the consumners.&#13;
6.6         The project faces the following significant risks: (a) delay in the availability of natural gas,&#13;
forcing the use of distillate for an extended period; and (b) higher than assumed price for natural gas.&#13;
Other lesser risks faced by the project are: (a) the plant operates at lower than assumed plant capacity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51-&#13;
factor due to the nature of system demand; and (b) higher than estimated capital cost. Sensitivities are&#13;
computed for the aforementioned risks (as also for a lower gas price of US$2.0/1,000 cu. ft. and the&#13;
results are as under:&#13;
Case                                                %EIRR&#13;
Base                                                      16.9&#13;
Delay in availability of gas:    6 months                 15.3&#13;
18 months                    13.1&#13;
Higher gas price:            US$3.0/1,000 cu.ft.          13.9&#13;
US$3.35/1,000 cu.ft.         12.0&#13;
Lower price of gas:          US$2.0/1,000 cu. ft.         19.7&#13;
Capital cost of the GT/CC plant increased by 20%          14.6&#13;
Annual plant capacity factor reduced to 55%               12.4&#13;
6.7        Under all scenarios, the EIRR remains at or above the threshold level of 12%  (the&#13;
opportunity cost of capital in Viet Nam) except when the gas price exceeds $3.35/1,000 cu. ft. A&#13;
combination of adverse events is unlikely, but could render the project marginally un-viable. However,&#13;
it is to be noted that the analysis-is conservative in that it does not take into account consumer surplus&#13;
(para. 6.5) which would increase all EIRRs substantially.&#13;
Transfonner Additions&#13;
6.8        The HV transformer additions are essentially components of overall network expansion&#13;
and rehabilitation programs and it is not feasible to evaluate their EIRRs in isolation. The existing&#13;
distribution networks in Viet Nam are old, unreliable and overloaded, and incur high losses. With the&#13;
forecast rapid increase in demands, large investments are needed in rehabilitating the old network&#13;
components, in expanding the networks to new areas and in connecting new consumers. Part of the&#13;
reason that sales are expected to increase so rapidly is that there is substantial pent-up demand because&#13;
of shortages in generating capacity. Detailed feasibility studies for upgrading distribution networks in&#13;
important areas in the South and North have been conducted by consultants. These studies provide&#13;
useful data on: (a) demand growths; (b) investment requirements over the next several years for meeting&#13;
the demands while upgrading the networks to acceptable levels of safety and reliability; and (c)&#13;
estimates of progressive reductions in losses and improvements in reliability (expressed in terms of&#13;
unserved energy due to outages).&#13;
6.9          The following methodology is used for evaluating the EIRR for the transformer additions&#13;
as part of distribution expansion and rehabilitation.&#13;
6.10       The analysis assumes two scenarios: (a) "with project"; and (b) "without project"'. The&#13;
"with project" scenario is based on incurring the full investments (in the HV transformer substation&#13;
reinforcements under the project and the downstream subtransmission and distribution systems) for&#13;
meeting the forecast demands and a progressive reduction in losses and unserved energy. The "without&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52-&#13;
project" scenario assumes that the system would be able to meet the full forecast demand growth with&#13;
zero investments but with progressive increase in losses and unserved energy. The "without project"&#13;
scenario makes the conservative assumption that the existing system would be able to meet the demand&#13;
growth. Incremental operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs are conservatively assumed to be the&#13;
same for both the scenarios, although in the "without project" scenario these would be higher. The&#13;
following are the main assumptions:&#13;
(a)   All costs are expressed in constant 1995 prices, mnaking no adjustments for shadow&#13;
exchange rate or shadow labor costs.&#13;
(b)   The downstream investments in subtransmission and distribution are assumed to be six&#13;
times the cost of HV transformer additions according to norms currently applicable for&#13;
power networks in Viet Nam and corresponding well with figures assumed in recent&#13;
feasibility studies by consultants.&#13;
(c)   The capital investmnent is considered over the 1996-2000 time slice (part of which would&#13;
be funded by the proposed project).&#13;
(d)   The analysis is made over a project economic life of 25 years, with no increases in sales&#13;
or losses or improvements in reliability after 2000.&#13;
(e)   The average retail sales tariff is assumed to increase from the current level of about 5&#13;
USc/kWh to 7 USc/kWh in 1999 as proposed by the Government.&#13;
(f)   The LRMC of supply at the HV level is assumed at 4.6 USc/kWh based on the Bank's&#13;
Energy Sector Investment and Policy Review (Report No. 10842-VN).&#13;
(g)   Unserved energy is very conservatively valued at 10 times the tariff level.&#13;
(h)   With the project, the technical losses are assumed to reduce over the years (based on&#13;
recent feasibility studies). Without the project, the percentage losses are assumed to&#13;
increase in proportion to the demand. The technical losses are valued at the LRMC of&#13;
supply at the HV  level (non-technical losses are not considered in the economic&#13;
evaluation).&#13;
6.11       The details of the economic analysis are presented in Annex 18. To test the robustness of&#13;
the EIRR for the base case, a sensitivity is undertaken, with unserved energy not evaluated. The&#13;
resulting EIRRs are tabulated below:&#13;
EIRR %&#13;
Case                                    South Viet Nam          Rest of Viet Nam&#13;
Base                                          42.6%                  40.1%&#13;
Unserved energy not evaluated                 24.8%                  20.4%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-&#13;
6.12        The results indicate robust EIRRs for these project components and there is little need to&#13;
undertake sensitivities for adverse conditions, such as lower demands and higher capital costs. The&#13;
EIRRs are likely to be underestimates because of the conservative assumptions made about the unserved&#13;
energy (both in terms of its magnitude and its evaluation) and about the other factors mentioned above.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
6.13        The Phu My component of the project faces two significant potential risks: First, delays in&#13;
commissioning of the power plant, which could result in curtailing demand in the south; Second, delays&#13;
in securing the gas supplies and the uncertainty about the gas price. The Government is conscious&#13;
about the need to take all measures possible to avoid implementation delays. The contract for the gas&#13;
turbines is in place and construction is progressing satisfactorily. Gas supply arrangements for the&#13;
earlier years are being finalized; the plant is not expected to burn distillate oil for more than six months&#13;
from start, and the EIRR is robust enough to tolerate burning of distillate for a year longer. With&#13;
regard to the long term gas supply arrangements, the Prime Minister has directed that gas should be&#13;
available at Phu My by the end of 1998 and negotiations between gas suppliers and EVN are well under&#13;
way. The project requires short-term gas arrangements to be finalized before credit effectiveness and&#13;
long-term arrangements by end-1996. It is expected that the price of gas could be satisfactorily&#13;
negotiated in the range of $2.5-3.5/1,000 cu. ft., within which the project is economically viable.&#13;
6.14        The only tangible risk associated with the transforner additions component is that of delay&#13;
in procurement which could result in overloading of transformers and/or shedding of load. The&#13;
Vietnamese are well aware of this situation, bids have already been invited, and appropriate&#13;
arrangements have been made for timely procurement decisions. The risk of demand not materializing&#13;
is small; in this case, the downstream investments in distribution could be delayed, besides the EIRR is&#13;
robust enough to tolerate lower demand growth rates.&#13;

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF POWER SECTIORPOLICY&#13;
Hknoi, December)', 1995&#13;
This paper sets out the main elements of Govemment of Vietnam's&#13;
(GOV) power sector policy, It outlines the objectives and strategy of the&#13;
Govemment. and the Ministry of Industry for the development of the Power&#13;
Sector of Vietnam&#13;
A. Policy Objectives&#13;
1.1  The Govemment's power sector policy aims to achieve the following&#13;
objectives:&#13;
(a)   Provide electricity access to the national economy and the entfre&#13;
population of Vietnam&#13;
(b)  Increase the operatingltechnical efficiency of the electicity sector&#13;
to optimize the use of scarce investment resources.&#13;
(c)   Ensure the best quality of elctricity delivered&#13;
(d)   Resolve the mismatch between market - based production costs&#13;
and State administered prices&#13;
(e)   Clearly delineate state managernent functions and business&#13;
management functions&#13;
(f)   Enable Vietnam to raise financing in the order of USS 1 billion&#13;
(10.000 bil. VND) annually for power sector expansion to meet&#13;
economic growth targets.&#13;
B. The power Sector In Vietnam - An Overview&#13;
1.2  In January 1995, GOV issued Decree No 141CP to establish Electricity of&#13;
Vietnam (EVN) - a group corporation for the different power sector entitis&#13;
engaged In generation, transmission, distribution and associated service&#13;
functions. The business units are grouped under two accounting systems:&#13;
(i)independent accounting; and, (ii). dependent accounting. The business units&#13;
fall into three categories:&#13;
* Those engaged in generation and transmission are subject to dependent&#13;
accounting, and consolidation of accounts takes place only at the level of&#13;
EVN as a whole (general EVN). There are 17 business units involved in&#13;
these activities - 12 for generation, 4 for transmission and I for National&#13;
Load dispatch center.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of 7&#13;
* Those responsible for distribution and supply are independent accounting&#13;
enterprise. There are five distribution units: Hanoi, HCMC, PC1, PC2 and&#13;
PC3.&#13;
*  Those involved in the provision of services (including finance, design and&#13;
construction, and  planning) have  either independent   or dependent&#13;
accounting status.&#13;

1.3    EVN  has the legal status of a state corporation  under the  State&#13;
Enterprise Law. Independent accounting entities will have the status of state&#13;
enterprises that are members of the state corporation (i.e EVN). Within the&#13;
EVN, the Board of Management (BoM) has the highest authority and exercises&#13;
the functions established under the new State Enterprise Law.&#13;
1.4    From  a sector structure  perspective, the core functions of generation&#13;
and transmission are integrated and under direct management of EVN&#13;
headquarters. The generation- transmission core sells electricity in bulk to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;

five independent distribution companies (Figure 1). Retails prices to final&#13;
consumers are established by the Govemment and are currently uniform&#13;
across the country. The mechanism for setting the BTP allows the distribution&#13;
companies to make a target profit - the profit level is determined by EVN. Given&#13;
uniform retail pricing and differing distribution system costs for each distribution&#13;
company, the bulk transfer price is different for each distribution company.&#13;
1.5   According to State - Owned Enterprise Law the Ministry of Industry&#13;
(MOI), as and  line ministries,. is responsible  for policy and oversight&#13;
functions(as the owners of state enterprises),   while all operational&#13;
responsibility is vested with operating companies.&#13;
1.6  The current installed capacity  is insufficient to meet the increasing&#13;
energy demand in Vietnam. Vietnam's power development plan calls for the&#13;
addition of 3000 MW by the tum of the century and about 6,000 MW by the&#13;
year 2005. To meet this ambitious expansion program, apart from govemment&#13;
budget, ODA funds and funds from Multinational Financial Institutions, GOV will&#13;
increasingly utilize private finance. Decree No. 87/CP on BOT (i.e Build -&#13;
Operate - Transfer) contracts facilitates private investment in infrastructure&#13;
including power projects.&#13;
C. Reform Strategy&#13;
1.7  The Govemment reform strategy addresses the following key aspects of&#13;
power sector reform. A proposed Reform Implementation Plan is attached.&#13;
(a)   Rationalizing Power Sector Institutions and Functions.&#13;
1.8   The Govemment plans to rationalize the functions and responsibilities of&#13;
the various bodies relevant to the power sector and clarify their exact roles. The&#13;
Govemment proposes:&#13;
, Ministry of Industry    perform  the "ownership function" and state&#13;
management functions over EVN.&#13;
* Management Board of EVN fulfill the ownership functions related  to EVN&#13;
activities, and be responsible for development of the Power sector to meet&#13;
the targets set by GOV&#13;
* Vest all operating and management responsibilities (except regulatory&#13;
functions) with EVN's General Director and the management team of Deputy&#13;
General Directors.&#13;
(b)   Structural Reform and Commercializafion of Sector Enterprise&#13;
1.9   GOV  proposes to  rationalize the power sector structure and&#13;
commercialize  the  operations  of  its  power  sector  enterprises.&#13;
Commercialization would include: (i) strengthening the finances and long-term&#13;
creditworthiness of sector enterprises; and, (ii) introducing improved operational&#13;
and management practices. The Govemment proposes to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-61-                                 Annex 2&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
*  Reevaluate the operational efficiency of the four transmission companies.&#13;
Consider the possibility of consolidation of the operations of the four&#13;
transmission companies under a single transmission business unit.&#13;
*  Strengthen  the  internal  organizational  structure,  improve  the&#13;
accountinglfinancial systems and streamline administrative procedures in&#13;
the distribution companies and the EVN generation-transmission core.&#13;
*  Establish  the  independent distribution  companies  as entities with&#13;
management and financial autonomy; define appropriate incentives to&#13;
undertake efficient investment and operating decisions; and, establish&#13;
performance contracts between the EVN Board of Management and&#13;
distribution companies.&#13;
*  Consider the feasibility of establishing non - core members enteprises of&#13;
EVN (eg Power Investigation and Design Companies) as seperate business&#13;
units.&#13;
(c)   Electricity Law and Regulatory Framework&#13;
1.10 It is expected to develop a consistent body of laws and regulations that&#13;
would facilitate efficient and commercial operation of the sector, provide&#13;
security to domestic and foreign investors in the sector and allow the&#13;
Govemment to supervise sector operations on an objective basis. It is proposed&#13;
as follows:&#13;
- Define the scope and institutional arrangements for regulation&#13;
- Prepare a draft Electricity Law&#13;
Prepare a Grid code that would formalize operating   arrangements&#13;
between: EVN generation entities and the integrated transmission operation;&#13;
independent BOT/JV generators and the EVN purchasing entity; and, EVN&#13;
generation-transmission core and distribution entities. The Grid Code will be&#13;
progressively operationalized.&#13;
(d)   Electricity Pricing - Bulk Transfer Price and Retail Price&#13;
1.11  It is recognized that cost-based retail prices and intemal transfer prices&#13;
are essential to a commercial power sector that is expected to raise the&#13;
required capital for its needs. Retail prices based on these principles will&#13;
ensure that resources are allocated efficiently in the economy and that&#13;
consumers face the appropriate price signals to utilize electricity efficiently.&#13;
Efficient intemal prices will provide incentives -to the distribution companies to&#13;
operate efficiently and establish an objective basis to evaluate the cost of&#13;
purchasing power from BOT/JV power generation schemes. It is proposed to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
-62-                                  Page 5 of 7&#13;
* Progressively raise average retail tariff to levels prevailing in the region by&#13;
1999 - 2000. The tariff is proposed to be varied to about 7 USC/kWh by&#13;
1999.&#13;
* Determine and adopt an appropriate bulk transfer prices (BTP) between the&#13;
distribution companies and the EVN generation-transmission core.&#13;
(e)   Private Sector Participation In Vietnam's Power Sector.&#13;
1.12  The objectives for promoting private sector participation are to: (i).&#13;
mobilize additional financial recourses in the form of debt and equity financing&#13;
with minimum Government guarantees; (ii). supplement public sector&#13;
investments; (iii). access the private sector's proven skills in project design,&#13;
finance, implementation and operation; and (iv) create an enabling environment&#13;
that fosters competition. It is expected to achieve: (i) balanced portfolio mix:&#13;
private power projects will be consistent with Vietnam's least-cost power plan in&#13;
terms of size and technology, and with the system's operational needs; (ii)&#13;
competitiveness: project sponsors will be selected through a competitive&#13;
bidding process measured in terms of the lowest price of electricity delivered;&#13;
and, (iii) limited recourse project financing: foreign investors will secure&#13;
financing under limited recourse basis where project sponsors and lenders will&#13;
assume commercial and project risks.&#13;
(f)   Rural Electrification&#13;
1.13 Only 65% of the Vietnamese population has access to electricity. Access&#13;
to electricity is much lower in rural than in urban areas. In order to increase&#13;
rural access to electricity the Govemment will develop a Rural Electrification&#13;
Master Plan. This master plan will define: (i). criteria for expanding the&#13;
electricity network to rural areas; (ii) appropriate regulatory, institutional and&#13;
financing frameworks; (iii) methodologies for forecasting and economic&#13;
evaluation of alternative supply locations and options; (iv). technical standards&#13;
for design, construction and operation.&#13;
(g)   Electricity Conservation&#13;
1.14 To facilitate the efficient utilization of electricity and encourage electricity&#13;
conservation practices and technobgies, the Govemment will examine the&#13;
potential and scope for electricity demand-side management (DSM), and load&#13;
management in Vietnam.&#13;

VIET NAM&#13;
Power Development Project (SRPDP)&#13;
Development of Phu My 2 Phase 2 with Private Sector Participation&#13;
Terms of Reference for Consulting Services&#13;
Background&#13;
1.         The Government of Vietnam  (GOVN) has embarked on reforming its state-owned&#13;
enterprises and has selected its power sector as a pilot-cxperiment enterprise reform under the&#13;
Enterprise Group initiative11. GOVN is conmmitted to the implementation of comprehensive reforms in&#13;
its power sector and as a first step, under Decree 14/CP dated January 22, 1995, it has reorganized and&#13;
regrouped the different power sector enterprises by establishing Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) as a&#13;
holding company. The charter of EVN calls for the creation of three hierarchical organizations: Board&#13;
of Management, Control Section, and Finance Company. Currently, the roles and responsibilities of&#13;
EVN as owner, regulator, and financier are in apparent conflict with each other. Under a separate&#13;
technical assistance provided by the joint World Bank/UNDP Energy Sector Management Assistance&#13;
Progranmme, GOVN is launching a study that will, inter alia, review options and make&#13;
recommendations for an appropriate legal and regulatory framework.&#13;
2.         GOVN's power sector reform measures will include setting up of a legal and regulatory&#13;
framework, commercialization and corporatization of EVN and the four independent distribution&#13;
companies, and fostering private investment in the power sector through Build-Own-Operate-Transfer&#13;
(BOOT) or Joint Venture (JV) type of arrangements. GOVN issued Decree No. 87-CP dated&#13;
November 23, 1993 on "Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) Contracts" to encourage foreign investments in&#13;
the construction and development of Vietnam's infrastructure.&#13;
3.         Although the BOT decree has generated private sector interest in power generation&#13;
projects, there has been no progress beyond signing of memoranda of understanding (MOUs) to on-the-&#13;
ground projects.&#13;
4.         Under the Southern Region Power Developmernt Project (SRPDP), GOVN, in coordination&#13;
with the World Bank, proposes to take concrete steps towards the developmrent of Phu My 2 Phase 2&#13;
(PHMY2-2) under a BOT/JV type of arrangement. It expects that this would be the precursor to future&#13;
such developments in the power sector of Viet Nam.&#13;
Objectives of The Consulting Services&#13;
5.         The objectives of the consulting services are to: (a) review GOVN's overall private sector&#13;
policy and legal framework vis-a-vis development, ownership, and operation of private power projects;&#13;
(b) identify constraints and recommend the necessary legal and incentive framework that would help&#13;
achieve specific power generation projects in an optimum manner through BOOT/JV type of&#13;
arrangements; (c) develop the solicitation, selection criteria, security package, and evaluation of request&#13;
for proposals (RFP) for the selection of project sponsors for PHMY2-2; and (d) assist GOVN in&#13;
1/ In March 1994, GOVN issued a decree No. 91/Ttg, Pilot-Work to Establish Enterprise Groups. This decree outlines the&#13;
GOVN's initiative of refofning large sectorAl and regional state-owned enterprises.&#13;

evaluating proposals, in contract negotiations and in executing contracts with the selected project&#13;
sponsor.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
6.          The consulting services will involve three main tasks. The first two tasks will comprise&#13;
Phase I and the third task, Phase II of this consultancy. Because private power project development in&#13;
developing countries is driven by financial issues and concerns of the developers and investors, the first&#13;
task will entail: (a) a thorough diagnostic analysis of (i) the requirements of the project sponsors,&#13;
lenders, and equity investors; and (ii) the requirements for mobilizing financial resources for successful&#13;
private sector power project development; and (b) crystallization of project objectives and&#13;
implementation framework vis-a-vis legal, regulatory, financial, technical, and institutional roles and&#13;
responsibilities, and preparation of a Request for Qualifications for the PHMY2-2 BOT power project.&#13;
After the successful completion of the first task, the second task will involve preparation of detailed&#13;
documents (request for proposals, security package (power purchase agreements, fuel supply&#13;
agreements, etc.) incorporating findings of the first task, and proposal evaluation criteria and&#13;
methodology - for the PHMY2-2 development; design and preparation of a Brochure on Vietnam's&#13;
Private Power Program; and a framework for setting up a "one-stop-shop" within the Ministry of&#13;
Energy (MOE) as a clearinghouse for information on Vietnam's private power policy and a road map&#13;
for implementing private power projects. In the third task the consultants will assist the GOVN team in&#13;
evaluating proposals and contract negotiations.&#13;
7.          The three tasks would consist of the following main activities:&#13;
Task I      Enabling Environment Diagnostics&#13;
Schedule:         October 1995 - December 1995&#13;

(b)   evaluate the adequacy of the legal and policy environment in attracting private investments&#13;
to Vietnam's power sector;&#13;
(c)   review and discuss the scope of EVN to participate as a minority equity partner in a BOT-&#13;
JV arrangement for PHMY2-2 and at the same time a purchaser of electricity from the&#13;
PHMY2-2 BOT-JV project company; if the existing legal and contractual framework pose&#13;
hurdles to EVN's participation as a minority equity partner, discuss contractual and&#13;
legislative options that will facilitate EVN's participation;&#13;
(d);  review the expectations and conditions from the international investors' and banking&#13;
community's perspective; discuss the spectrum of risks in project development (pre- and&#13;
post commissioning) and recommend alternative schemes and security arrangements for&#13;
risk allocation and resolution;&#13;

(j)   review issues of sovereign guarantees or financial institutions that can provide guarantee&#13;
for contract performance by the power purchaser;&#13;
(k)   evaluate and recommend different project ownership and financing structures for the Phu&#13;
My 2 - Phase 2 project and also identify the role of the World Bank Group in catalyzing&#13;
private sector power development; the range of options for project ownership and&#13;
financing structures considered should delineate the documentation requirements for each&#13;
option and conformity or lack thereof with the legal and contractual framework; also see&#13;

Task III: This task is not amenable to scheduling a report because the extent and nature of the&#13;
Consultants' assistance is not known. Any work accomplished will result in a draft report&#13;
submitted to CG within one month after completion and final report will be prepared 45 days&#13;
later, incorporating CG comments.&#13;
Final Report to be submitted to the GOVN no later than 18 months after signing of the Contract.&#13;
Execution Schedule&#13;
13.        The first phase of this consultancy service which comprise Tasks I and II will be&#13;
completed in 8 months, after Contract signing, in accordance with the attached Schedule (Annex 1).&#13;
The second phase (Task III) will be completed in 8 to 9 months so as to meet the target commissioning&#13;
of PHMY2-2 simple cycle (gas turbine operation) by June 1998.&#13;
General Conditions&#13;
14.        Due to the complexity and evolving nature of the assignment, the Consultant shall be&#13;
prepared to act as a conduit for additional expertise that may be identified and required during the&#13;
implementation of this assignment. This additional expertise may be sourced from individual experts not&#13;
associated with the Consultant and would be made available through the Consultants contract.&#13;
Contracting of a consortium of technical, legal, and financial advisory firms will be considered.&#13;
15.        Experts assigned by the Consultant should have extensive international experience of direct&#13;
relevance and some knowledge of the Vietnam's power sector. Close coordination with a parallel&#13;
technical assistance for Vietnam's grid code, and power sector legal and regulatory framework by the&#13;
joint World Bank/UNDP Energy Sector Management Assistance Progranmne is deemed critical to&#13;
overall success.&#13;

Current Status of Rural Electrification in Vietnam&#13;
Present status of rural Rower network development&#13;
1.         Electricity supply to rural areas in the North of Vietnam started from the late 1950's.&#13;
Network development was, however, totally halted in the war period (1964-1972), was resumed in 1980&#13;
and considerably accelerated from 1985 onwards. In the Southern Region, the electricity supply for&#13;
rural areas started and developed at a substantial rate only after 1975.&#13;
2.          As of 1993, electricity consumption in rural areas was 1,243 GWh (23.7% of commercial&#13;
electricity) of which agricultural use accounted for 485.3 GWh (39% of total rural electricity). Region-&#13;
wise consumption was:&#13;
(a)   Northern Region (to Ha Tinh province): 883 GWh (23.7%  of Northern Region&#13;
conmnercial electricity) in which agricultural production: 321 GWh (36.4%).&#13;
(b)   Central Region (from Quang Binh to Phy Khanh), Tay Nguyen (except Lam Dong): 112&#13;
GWh (17.5%  commercial electricity for Central Region) in which for agricultural&#13;
production: 99.3 GWh (40%).&#13;
(c)   Southern Region: 248 GWh (7.3%  of Southern Region commercial electricity) in which&#13;
agricultural production: 99.3 GWh (40%).&#13;
3.          The rural power networks have been developed fairly. According to the statistics of 1992&#13;
the whole country had 19,872 kan of medium-voltage 6-35 kV lines (76% of total), transformers with&#13;
capacity of 2,616 MUA (43% of total).&#13;
4.          The districts and conmmunes being supplied with electricity by power companies are as&#13;

7.          As of now, Viet Nam does not have a master plan for rural electrification that lays down&#13;
policies, strategies and criteria for meeting provincial rural area development priorities. There are a&#13;
number of technical, financial and institutional constraints, including: (a) inadequate transmission and&#13;
distribution networks, poor power supply reliability and poor loading characteristics in rural areas; (b)&#13;
scarcity of investment capital, subsidized pricing practices, inadequate private investment mechanisms&#13;
and underdeveloped domestic equipment enterprises; and (c) lack of locally based institutions to manage&#13;
and operate grid-connected and/or isolated rural electric networks.&#13;
Objectives of the Study&#13;
8.          The main objectives of the rural electrification master plan study  are to define: a)&#13;
appropriate regulatory, institutional and financing frameworks; b) methodologies for forecasting and&#13;
economic evaluation of alternative supply locations and options; and c) technical standards of design,&#13;
construction and operation. The study should provide a basis for detailed project preparation.&#13;

VIET NAM&#13;
Power Development Project&#13;
Electricity Law and Regulatory Framework&#13;
(Terms of Reference for Technical Assistance)&#13;
Background&#13;
The Goverrnent of Viet Nam (GOVN) has in conjunction with macro-economic reform efforts,&#13;
initiated a broad program of power sector reforms. In January 1995, GOVN issued Decree No.14/CP&#13;
to establish Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) - a holding corporation for the different power sector&#13;
entities engaged in generation, transmission, distribution and associated service functions.  From a&#13;
sector structure perspective, the core functions of generation and transmission are integrated, and&#13;
distribution is separate.   There are five distribution companies and they are able to maintain&#13;
independent accounts, and have the status of state enterprises in accordance with the State Enterprise&#13;
Law. EVN is classified as a state corporation according to the State Enterprise Law and comprises of&#13;
member state enterprises. EVNs Board of Management (BoM) has been vested with responsibility to&#13;
exercise the States ownership function based on the principles established under the new State&#13;
Enterprise Law. It also oversees the operation and management of EVN.&#13;
Retail prices to final consumers are established by the Government and are currently uniform across the&#13;
country. Electricity is sold in bulk by the integrated generation-transmission core to the independent&#13;
distribution companies. The mechanism for setting the bulk transfer price allows the distribLtion&#13;
companies to make a target profit - the profit level is determined by EVN. Given uniform retail pricing&#13;
and differing distribution system costs for each distribution company, the bulk transfer price is different&#13;
for each distribution company.&#13;
The Ministry of Energy (MOE) has been significantly rationalized in parallel with the establishment of&#13;
EVN. Consistent with the Governmend policy for all line ministries, MOE is increasingly responsible&#13;
for policy and oversight functions, while all operational responsibility is being vested with operating&#13;
companies.&#13;
The current installed capacity of [4,200 MW] is insufficient to meet the annual energy demand in&#13;
Vietnam. VietnamA power development plan calls for the addition of 2,400 MW by the turn of the&#13;
century and about 6,000 MW by the year 2005. To meet this ambitious expansion program, GOVN&#13;
will increasingly utilize private finance which is essential to meet the power sector expansion targets.&#13;
Decree No.87/CP on BOT (i.e. Build-Operate-Transfer) contracts facilitates private investment in&#13;
infrastructure including power projects.&#13;
In a recently completed exercise the Ministry of Energy and EVN examined the implications of the&#13;
sector structure and defined a series of actions to continue the refonn process and ensure that reform&#13;
objectives can be achieved. This exercise which was conducted with the assistance of IDA/ESMAP&#13;
concluded that some form of transparent economic regulation was necessary for the power sector.&#13;
From a reform perspective the development of consistent body of laws and regulations was required to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-85-&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
facilitate efficient and commercial operation of the sector, provide security to domestic and foreign&#13;
investors in the sector and allow the Government to supervise sector operations on an objective basis.&#13;
Further, as the entry of independent generators is envisaged an operational grid code would clarify the&#13;
technical and operational standards and responsibilities of independent entities in the sector. This&#13;
technical assistance project is designed to address this priority area of power sector reform.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
The technical assistance project will assist GOVN in developing a legal and regulatory framework for&#13;
the power sector, to accelerate and support on-going power sector reform efforts. The creation of a&#13;
suitable regulatory system and institutions is a pre-requisite for a commercially-oriented power system.&#13;
The mnain elements of this work are:&#13;
1.   definition of the appropriate regulatory functions to be undertaken by government supervisory&#13;
agencies;&#13;
2.   delineating the regulatory responsibilties of different government agencies and ministeries;&#13;
3.   devising a suitable institutional form for the conduct of these functions, as well as establishing&#13;
regulatory procedures and mechanisms;&#13;
4.   preparing the required draft electricity legislation and regulations; and&#13;
5.   Preparing a grid code that would formalize operating arrangements between: EVN generation&#13;
entities and the integrated transmission operation; independent BOT/JV generators and the EVN&#13;
purchasing entity; and, EVN generation-transmission core and distribution entities. The grid&#13;
code will be progressively operationalized.&#13;
Scope and Organization of Work&#13;
Given the complexity of regulatory reform and the need for a process that is open to review and inputs&#13;
by all stakeholders, the technical assistance activity will be divided into 5 phases.&#13;
Ph.e  1: Counterpat Arrangements and Background Report&#13;
GOVN will designate a suitable high-level steering conmnittee to oversee and direct the activity. This&#13;
Steering Conmnittee will include officials from the relevant government agencies and ministries that&#13;
have a stake in the process of power sector reform. These agencies will include, but not be limited to,&#13;
Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Justice, State Planning Conmmission, Ministry of Finance, etc..&#13;
The Steering Conmmittee will be responsible for setting up a working group and constituent task forces&#13;
to interact on a day-today basis with the international advisory team, and carry out the required analytic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-86-&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
and conceptual work. It is envisaged that the working group will include representatives from power&#13;
companies, and the principal government agencies and entities involved in power sector decisions and&#13;
operations. It is advisable to involve key individuals who assisted with the earlier IDA/ESMAP&#13;
financed work on 'Options for Power Sector Restructuring' in the working group to provide the&#13;
required continuity with this activity.&#13;
The working group will complete a review of the implementation of sector reforms and prevailing&#13;
institutional arrangements. This review will form the basis of preliminary discussion of issues and&#13;
regulatory objectives within Viet Nam.&#13;
The formation of the Steering Committee, Working Group, and preparation of the background report&#13;
will be completed by Sept./Oct. 1995.&#13;
Phase 2: Definition of Fundamental Prnciples and Scope of Power Sector Regulation&#13;
This task will be completed during a two week period of intensive discussions between the working&#13;
group and international advisory team. The main elements of this second phase of work are the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a).  Review and discussion of the background report by intemational consultants&#13;
(b).  Presentation and discussion of international experiences in power sector regulation. The focus&#13;
will be on clarifying the concepts of economic regulation and discussing the advantages and&#13;
disadvantages of different regulatory techniques.&#13;
(c).  Definition of guiding principles and objectives of power sector regulation in Viet Nam.&#13;
(d).  Outline of the required or desired scope of power sector regulation in Viet Nam.&#13;
(e).  Preliminary scope and requirements for an Electricity Law&#13;
(f).  The requirements of a Grid Code for Viet Nam&#13;
In effect, the output of this phase will lay the foundations for more discussions on the details and&#13;
structure of power sector regulation. This task will be undertaken in Dec. 95/Jan. 96.&#13;
Phase 3: Preliminary Design of the Electricity Law &amp; Regulatory Framework&#13;
The Working Group and the international consulting team will in this phase focus on four aspects of&#13;
regulatory framework design. Broadly defined, these are:&#13;
1.   Price Regulation&#13;
2.   Separation of Regulatory Function from EVN&#13;
3.   Regulation of Franchise Operations and Licensing&#13;
4.   Requirements of a Grid Code&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

The four topics, which are outlined in greater detail below, are inter-related. The Vietnamese working&#13;
group could be divided into four task forces corresponding to the four topics. The issues that are&#13;
common to all four topics listed above, relate to: (i). the allocation of regulatory roles and&#13;
responsibilities; and (ii). the regulatory mechanism and organizational structure to perform these&#13;
regulatory functions. These issues will be discussed in by the individual task forces, as well as in&#13;
plenary session when required.&#13;
A detailed, although not comprehensive, scope of issues to be tackled by the four task forces is as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Task Force 1: Price Regulation&#13;
(a).  Retail and bulk prices that need to be regulated:&#13;
-    Retail consumer price&#13;
-    Bulk transfer price regulation&#13;
(b).  Evaluation of mechanisms to regulate prices; principles to establish pricing policies; information&#13;
needs for price setting/review; administrative processes for price revisions in the regulated&#13;
monopoly segment of the power sector.&#13;
(c).  Identification of institutional mechanism to regulate prices&#13;
Task Force 2: Separation of Regulatorv Function from EVN&#13;
(a).  Review and assessment of the role and responsibilities of EVNs Board of Management. The&#13;
impediments to effective and efficient enterprise management should be clearly identified.&#13;
(b).  Institutional arrangements to undertake all regulatory/government functions currently performed&#13;
by EVNs Board of Management and completing its separation from enterprise management and&#13;
ownership.&#13;
Task Force 3: Regulation of Franchise Operations and Licensine&#13;
(a).  Evaluation of current procedures and institutional responsibility for system planning, and the&#13;
obligation to serve&#13;
(b).  Identification and evaluation of options to draw a balance between the need for appropriate&#13;
oversight of planning and investment decision and the obligation to serve by a local supplier.&#13;
(c).  Reconciling the obligation to serve under a workable licensing and franchising framework&#13;
(d).  Identification of methods and mechanisms to separate central and local responsibilities&#13;

(b).  Creating an objective and arms-length mechanism for:&#13;
-     regulating bulk sales of power&#13;
-    access to transmission networks&#13;
(c).  Implementing and operationalizing a Grid Code&#13;
Phase 4:    Workshop -   Power Sector Regulation in Viet Nam&#13;
A key phase in this technical assistance will be a workshop on power sector regulation. The workshop&#13;
will targeted at a audience of senior policy makers, power enterprise officials and power sector experts.&#13;
At this workshop the working groups will present the task force interim reports (i.e. output of phase 3)&#13;
on power sector regulation in Viet Nam. The workshop will be important in developing broad&#13;
consensus amongst policy makers in Viet Nam on the pace and scope of regulatory reform in the power&#13;
sector.&#13;
The workshop will be held in Hanoi around July 1996. At present a three-day event is envisaged - 1-&#13;
day for opening session, an overview of the work, and a presentation of international experience in&#13;
power sector regulation; 2-days for presentation and discussion of task force interim reports by the&#13;
Vietnamese working group.&#13;
Phase 5: Recommended Regulatory Framework and Institutional Structure, Draft Electridty Law&#13;
Based on the inputs and discussions at the workshop, the working group and the international consultant&#13;
team will begin to develop the elements of a workable regulatory framework. This task will include:&#13;
(a).  Draft power sector regulation that clearly addresses all the major aspects of regulation discussed&#13;
by the four task forces. It is of crucial importance that the draft regulation clearly delineate the&#13;
roles and responsibilities of the different government agencies.&#13;
(b).  Design of an institutional structure that will be able to enforce the draft regulations. The&#13;
structure must clearly identify new/revised roles of existing institutions, clarify their functions&#13;
and propose an organizational structure and staffing for any new institution.&#13;
(c).  Preparation of a draft Electricity Law&#13;
Time Schedule&#13;
This activity should be completed within 12-16 months of initiation. If work is initiated around&#13;
August/September 1995, a preliminary draft/design of the legal and regulatory framework (Phase 3)&#13;

Power Development Project&#13;
Environmental Assessment Summary&#13;
Phu My 1 and 2 Power Plants&#13;
Project Description&#13;
1.1        The project is for the development of 800MW of combined cycle plant at Phu My in the&#13;
South of Vietnam. The plant will burn natural gas which will be available in mid 1997. At this stage&#13;
the only stack emissions of significance would be NOx (oxides of nitrogen) which will be maintained&#13;
below a level of 50 ppm by use of low NOx burners. The first two gas turbines will, however, be&#13;
commissioned in December 1996 and will burn distillate fuel oil for about 6 months until natural gas is&#13;
available. During this phase emission of NOx will be rather high at about 300 ppm as it is not&#13;
justifiable to install NOx reduction measures for such a short period.&#13;
1.2        A conventional thermal plant called Phu My 1 as also planned for the site and will consist&#13;
of 3 x 200MW units. Phu My I will also burn natural gas. Residual fuel oil will be used for&#13;
emergency standby. For completeness of information this EIA considers total emissions from the site,&#13;
i.e. Phu My 1 and 2.&#13;
1.3        Cooling water for the plants will be taken from the Sao stream at the rate of 60n3/s and&#13;
will be discharged to the Thivai estuary. Chlorination of the system in order to reduce fouling will be&#13;
carried out so that the residual chlorine level at the discharge is &lt;0.02 ppm.&#13;
1.4       Waste water streams will include water treatment plant waste, sewage, surface drains,&#13;
boiler washings and other minor sources typical of a power station. They will be treated as appropriate&#13;
so that the effluents will satisfy IBRD and Vietnamese regulations.&#13;
1.5        The plant will require fresh water for boiler make-up and domestic use at a maximum rate&#13;
of about 2000 m3/day. This will be supplied by wells on site. Gas will be delivered by pipeline and&#13;
distillate and heavy fuel oil by tanker. A 4km power line will be constructed to join the existing&#13;
transmission system.&#13;
Baseline Data&#13;
1.6        The Phu My site is located in a rural area about 70kn south east of Ho Chi Minh City.&#13;
The population of the small townlet is about 8000 and the main economic activities are farming and&#13;
fishing. The average income is low even compared to nearby districts and infrastructure and services&#13;
such as electrical supply, roads, health services and education are also poor.&#13;
1.7        Given the rural nature of the site air quality is expected to be good.  Limited&#13;
measurements on the site show that this is so with levels of NO2 of 0 - 0.06 mg/mn3 and levels of SO2 of&#13;
0.010 - 0.02 mg/m3.&#13;
Ks &#13;

Annex 10&#13;
Page 2 of 11&#13;
1.8        Noise measurements carried out at 3 locations show levels of about 40 dBA at night and&#13;
higher levels at day time, probably due to nearby construction activities for a harbour development.&#13;
For power station design night time levels are the most significant as the permitted noise levels are&#13;
lowest during night.&#13;
1.9        The most significant ecological system is that of the mangrove forest and associated fish,&#13;
shell fish and other animal species. This appears under threat in this region as it does in many parts of&#13;
South East Asia due to:-&#13;
*     Excessive siltation and organic pollution&#13;
*     Harvesting for firewood and charcoal manufacture&#13;
*     Operation of shrimp and fish aquaculture enterprises which may involve clearing&#13;
mangrove areas as well as, depending on the stocking level, water pollution from biocides&#13;
and other wastes.&#13;
1.10       There is evidence of all the above activities near Phu My; however successful replanting&#13;
of mangroves has also taken place in areas where they were cut down. Development of shrimp&#13;
aquaculture probably represents the single greatest threat.&#13;
1.11        A survey of mangrove trees in the site and nearby study area indicated the presence of 32&#13;
species.  The distribution depends on submersion and salinity levels as well as impacts of artificial&#13;
replanting. The survey also found the following numbers of animal species which are largely associated&#13;
with the mangrove areas;&#13;
*     30 species of birds&#13;
*     17 species of mammals&#13;
*     8  species of amphibians&#13;
*     16 species of reptiles&#13;
1.12       The site itself, which is 150ha in extent contain, about 20 ha of mangrove area. The rest&#13;
is mostly cultivated for rice, cashew nut trees, eucalyptus and other crops. Apart from the mangroves&#13;
there are no significant habitats or wild life areas on the site or in the surrounding area.  A study&#13;
carried out showed the presence of 201 species of plant in the study area of which 101 occurred in the&#13;
actual site area.&#13;
1.13       The Thivai river estuary, which runs by the site, will be utilised to disperse the heat in the&#13;
cooling water discharged from the plant. It is wide (400m) and deep (15 - 30m) with a tidal variation&#13;
of about 3m and a large tidal flow (1O,00Om3/s). Analyses of the water quality of the Thivai estuary&#13;
indicated the following main features:-&#13;
*    High salinity levels, particularly in the dry season.&#13;
*     Some evidence of oil pollution.&#13;
*     Organic pollution from domestic sources.&#13;
*     Moderate levels of dissolved oxygen.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 10&#13;
Page 3 of 11&#13;
1.14       Surveys of the aquatic ecosystem of the Thivai river indicate that it is typical of the nearby&#13;
large area of delta. It is rich in numbers of species but with some evidence of an impact from organic&#13;
pollution. The baseline surveys identified the following numbers of species:-&#13;
*    72 species of phytoplankton and 31 species of zooplancton.&#13;
*    60 species of fish and 22 species of shellfish.&#13;
*    42 species of zoobenthos (near site).&#13;
1.15       Fish eggs and larvae are considered particularly sensitive to enviromnental disturbance. A&#13;
survey of eggs and larvae in the Thivai estuary showed numbers and species composition typical of the&#13;
delta area. The larvae were found to migrate from surface layer to the bottom depending on the time of&#13;
day.&#13;
Environmental Impacts&#13;
1.16       The proposed project, consisting of combined cycle plant burning natural gas, is the most&#13;
environmentally benign forn of thermal power plant. It has a very high efficiency, close to 50%, and&#13;
lower air emissions and cooling water requirements per unit of electricity generated than for&#13;
conventional plant. In particular, when burning natural gas with a low NOx burner as is planned for&#13;
this project, there are no significant emissions of NOx or SO2 and emissions of carbon dioxide are 50%&#13;
lower than for conventional plant burning fuel oil or coal.&#13;
1.17       A major and positive impact will be the provision of 800MW generating capacity. This&#13;
will impact on a regional basis by strengthening the electricity supply network and allowing the&#13;
connection of extra consumers and the development of industry and services in the region. The&#13;
employment of large number of people during the construction and operation phase will also benefit the&#13;
local economy.&#13;
1.18       While some disturbance will be caused to the townlet of Phu My the overall impact should&#13;
be positive by the provision of jobs and improvement of infrastructure.&#13;
1.19       During the construction phase there will be a permanent loss of 2 ha of mangrove forest&#13;
due to the construction of a jetty and a loss of about 0.5 ha of mangrove at the cooling water intake.&#13;
There will be a temporary loss of 1 ha due to construction of the cooling water outlet pipes. As these&#13;
will be buried the areas can be replanted.&#13;
1.20       Dredging of the Thivai river in order to allow berthing of tankers of 10,000 dw tonnage as&#13;
well as all the cooling water system construction will cause a local and temporary loss of benthnic&#13;
animals as well as disturbance of fish and other organisms.&#13;
1.21       Impacts of other construction activities such as noise, dust, sewage, after taking into&#13;
account mitigation measures, will be minor.&#13;
1.22       The Phu My 1 and 2 Power Stations will bum natural gas and the only stack emission of&#13;
interest will be NOx. A dispersion analysis was carried out for the case of plants on full load and&#13;
showed that the maximum hourly ground level concentration of NO2 when burning natural gas would be&#13;
0.11 mg/m3 while the maximum annual average will be 0.002 mg/m3. These relatively low values will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-96-&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 4 of 11&#13;
be well below IBRD and Vietnamese air quality regulations and will be of minor significance to air&#13;
quality in the area.&#13;
1.23       For about six months the first two gas turbines to be commissioned will burn distillate&#13;
until natural gas reaches the site. The rate of emission of NOx will be quite high at 300 ppm as&#13;
methods of reducing NOx levels such as water injection are not considered feasible for this short&#13;
period. However as they will be on open cycle for this period the high exit temperature will provide&#13;
good dispersion characteristics. A dispersion analysis for this case showed that maximum hourly&#13;
ground level concentrations of NO2 would be 0.100 mg/m3. This level will not break ambient air&#13;
quality standards nor will it have a significant impact over the short period involved.&#13;
1.24       Specification for the proposed plant will be such that noise levels at the site perimeter will&#13;
not exceed permnitted levels for residential areas. This will ensure that no noise nuisance is caused at&#13;
nearest residences.&#13;
1.25       Cooling water discharge will be at a maximum rate of 60m3/s and a temperature rise of&#13;
70C. The discharge will be deep into the Thivai estuary which has a large tidal flow of 10,000 m3/sec.&#13;
A thermal diffusion study indicates that the physical impact will be minor with, for the worst case, a&#13;
thermal plume of 1°C extending across the estuary. Beyond the immediate outfall the maximum&#13;
temperature rise will be 1.5°C.&#13;
1.26       Ecological impacts of the thermal plume are not predicted to be significant. However,&#13;
because it is a deep discharge some scouring will take place at the outfall. No significant impacts will&#13;
be caused to aquaculture or commercial fishery on the Thivai River.&#13;
1.27       Chlorination of the cooling water will take place at a rate that will leave a residual level of&#13;
&lt;0.02 ppm at the outfall. At this concentration the chlorine should not have any significant impacts&#13;
beyond the discharge point.&#13;
1.28       A large number of organisms including fish eggs and larvae will be entrained by the&#13;
cooling water system and significant mortality will occur due to pressure, temperature rise and&#13;
chlorination. This is not predicted to have an overall impact on fish numbers in the area due to the&#13;
large amount of similar habitat in the region and due to the small ratio of CW flow to overall tidal&#13;
flow.&#13;
1.29       Other waste water streams from the plant include water treatment plant effluent, sewage,&#13;
surface drains, boiler washes and acid cleans. These will all be treated as appropriate so that the&#13;
effluents will satisfy Vietnamese regulations and will have no environmental impacts on the receiving&#13;
water.&#13;
1.30       Oil spillage into the sensitive mangrove ecosystem represents a serious menace. In order&#13;
to minimise this risk strict procedures will be implemented for the delivery, unloading, storage and&#13;
handling of oil as well as an emergency response plan and clean up procedures.&#13;
1.31       Dredging will be required occasionally in order to maintain navigable depth at the jetty.&#13;
This will create a local and temporary disturbance to biota in the area. The dredged material will be&#13;
transported for land reclamation to an area not yet designated.&#13;

Summary of Altematives&#13;
1.32       Alternatives to the proposed project should be seen in the context of a high predicted&#13;
growth in electricity demand in the South Vietnam area over the next twenty years. This growth is&#13;
required for economic development and improvement in standard of living. A mixture of thermal and&#13;
hydroelectric power, which are complimentary to each other, is required to satisfy this demand.&#13;
Alternative designs and sites were considered.&#13;
1.33       A natural gas fired combined cycle plant, such as the present design, has the following&#13;
major advantage over other types of thermal plant which might be considered&#13;
*    Lower capital cost&#13;
*    Shorter lead times to power production&#13;
*    Small land area requirements&#13;
*    Higher efficiencies&#13;
*    Lower air emissions per unit of electricity generated&#13;
*    Lower cooling water requirements per unit of electricity generated.&#13;
1.34       A number of alternative sites were considered and evaluated on the following criteria:-&#13;
-    Proximity to Bach-Ho - Thu Duc gas pipeline&#13;
-    Distance to transmission lines&#13;
*    Cooling water availability&#13;
-    Environmental and socioeconomic issues&#13;
-    Site area available&#13;
-    Construction and engineering issues.&#13;
The site at Phu My was judged as the optimum available.&#13;

Summary of Mitigation Measures&#13;
1.35            In order to reduce enviromnental impacts from  the proposed development mitigation&#13;
measures, sunmmarised below, have already been put in hand or are planned. Apart from these, and&#13;
taking into account the minor residual impacts of the proposed development, no further mitigation&#13;
measures are considered necessary.&#13;
1.36            Mitigation measures to apply during the construction phase include the following:-&#13;
*       Provision  of housing, clean  water, sanitation  facilities, health  services  to  the&#13;
construction workers.&#13;
*       Sewage treatment.&#13;
*       Dust suppression control&#13;
*       Noise control&#13;
1.37            During the operation phase air emissions will be controlled by burning natural gas and&#13;
installing low NOx burners.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-102-&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 10 of I1&#13;
1.38         Noise control will be by housing and acoustic cladding of noisy plant to ensure noise&#13;
levels at the site perimeter are within regulations.  Other noise reduction measures such as tree&#13;
plantations may be used as appropriate.&#13;
1.39         Impacts of the cooling water system will be mitigated by:-&#13;
*     Design of outfall to reduce extent of thermal plumes.&#13;
*     Maintaining residual chlorine levels at less than 0.02 ppm.&#13;
*     Measures to reduce impingement of fish at the intake.&#13;
1.40         All other waste water streams will be treated so that effluents will satisfy Vietnamese&#13;
regulations and will not cause any significant impacts.&#13;
1.41         In order to avoid risks of ground water pollution or soil contanination all waste&#13;
materials that will arise at the site will be monitored as to type and quantity and removed offsite for&#13;
disposal or recycling.&#13;
Environmental Management and Training&#13;
1.42         It is recommended that an environmental unit be set up as part of the management&#13;
structure in the new development at Phu My. The main function of this unit would be the monitoring&#13;
and control of waste water streams and other emissions from the plant. This function could be&#13;
combined with the already planned water quality analysis programme at little additional expense.&#13;
1.43         It is also recommended that as EVN  expands its generation programme, an&#13;
environmental co-ordinator be established with the function of developing environmental policy, issuing&#13;
in-house guidelines and establishing compliance with standards and regulations and setting up an&#13;
environmental management system.&#13;
1.44         It is further recommended that this co-ordinator would also liaise with other groups such&#13;
as a coastal zone management group in order to promote strategies for the protection and sustainable&#13;
development of the delicate coastal zone.&#13;
Environmental Monitoring&#13;
1.45  In order to fully control the implementation of the proposed project, it is recommended that the&#13;
following monitoring programme be put in place:-&#13;
*     Monitoring programme of the waste water streams from the new project.&#13;
*      Extension of the existing air monitoring programme.&#13;
*      Noise monitoring at the site perimeter.&#13;
*      Monitoring of waste materials arising on site.&#13;
*     A review of the baseline ecological study of the Thivai river estuary particularly in the&#13;
area near the power plant site.&#13;
1.46         During the construction phase monitoring for dust levels, noise levels, sewage effluent&#13;
should be carried out to ensure no nuisance is created.&#13;

SECTION 1&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
A - The Project&#13;
1.        Under the Power Development Project, the Electricity of Viet Nain (EVN) will be&#13;
constructing the Phu My 2 (PM2) Power Station (the Project), comprising two 300-450 MW combined&#13;
cycle power blocks. This power station will require acquisition of 180,000 ml of land in 1995. This&#13;
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) covers this power station and has been prepared by the Management&#13;
Board of Phu My - Ba Ria power plants of EVN (PMBRMB) with the consulting support of the Power&#13;
Investigation &amp; Design Company N°2 and was approved by EVN and the relevant local government&#13;
bodies at the end of August 1995. The power station is located on land where further power generation&#13;
development is planned. Resettlement, compensation, and rehabilitation of persons affected by further&#13;
power station development will follow the principles laid down in this RAP. This RAP applies for&#13;
PM2.&#13;
2.         At the Phu My Site it is proposed to construct power plants PM1, PM3 and PM4 in the&#13;
future. The Land for PM1, PM2 and PM4 and cooling water intake and discharge canals for these&#13;
plants were acquired together and the compensation payment will be finished by the end of October,&#13;
1995. The principles for the total land acquisition process followed the same guidelines, and are&#13;
described in this RAP. However, the numbers of affected persons and households, the approximate area&#13;
acquired, etc. are only those for PM2.&#13;
(See attached Map 3)&#13;
B - Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)&#13;
Project Impact Area&#13;
3.         Phu My 2 power plant will be constructed in Phu My Townlet, Tan Thanh District, Ba&#13;
Ria-Vung Tau province. Phu My Townlet was set up since August 15, 1994 from the former Phu My&#13;
village. Phu My Townlet is located in an area running from km 44 to km 47 along the National Road&#13;
No 51 and on the left bank of the Thi Vai river. The distance from the Townlet to Ho Chi Minh City is&#13;
about 80 km., 20km to the provincial center of Ba Ria and 40hn to the coastal city of Vung Tau.&#13;
4.         Phu My Towniet covers 3,000 ha. Its population is 8,126 people living in 1,481 famnilies.&#13;
There are 3,707 people of working age. The percentage of women is 50%, children under 15 years old&#13;
is 30%. The percentage of economic dependants is 54.25%. Agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery,&#13;
salt production and forestry are main professions of local people. The other subsidiary professions are&#13;
service and handicrafts.&#13;
5.         More than 65% of the inhabitants live on agricultural activities concentrated mainly on&#13;
tree crops (fruit and cashew nuts) and partially on rice cultivation. Since soil in the Phu My site is&#13;
sandy and salty, the agricultural production is very low. Average annual income per capita of local&#13;
farmers is low, at about VND 891,320 (1994 statistics).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-107-&#13;
Annex I I&#13;
Page 4 of 16&#13;
Project Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impact&#13;
6.         The Phu My 2 Power Plant covers a total area of 180,000 m2. The total area for this RAP&#13;
analysis is taken all plots affected particularly/or fully by PM2 plant. On this area will be constructed&#13;
the power generating plant itself and ancillary buildings like administration, water treatment plant,&#13;
workshop, warehouse and fuel supply system. The cooling water system and oil unloading jetty will be&#13;
commnon with Phu My 1 power plant. The plant will be permanently connected to the network through&#13;
220kV busbar of Phu My 1 220kV switchyard.&#13;
7.         Since PM1 will be built after PM2, the PM2 project will temporarily connect to the Ba&#13;
Ria - Long Binh transmission line by overhead 220kV line. Right - of - way for this temporary&#13;
transmission line is 4.4km long and 21.6m wide, and it is included in the PM2 project.&#13;
8.         The transmission line, and its routing, has not been decided and approved by the&#13;
Government, therefore the land requirement for this has not yet been determined. This RAP is based on&#13;
the assumption that the transmission line is chosen as indicated on the attached Map 2.&#13;
9.         Similarly, the underground gas fuel pipeline from the Ba Ria gas supply station to the&#13;
power plant has not yet been finally located and designed, and land requirements for this has not yet&#13;
been determined, this will be contracted out for gas fuel delivery at the fence. For both the transmission&#13;
line and the fuel intake, the principles of this RAP will be followed.&#13;
10.        The project produces two major impacts. The first is land acquisition and the resettlement&#13;
of the area of the power station site and the second is the clearance and relocation of houses under the&#13;
transmission line and the fuel intake line.&#13;
Il.        Based on the survey, the power station area consists of 130 pieces of land belonging to 49&#13;
households of the Quang Phu hamlet of Phu My Townlet and 3 households of Vung Tau city. All the&#13;
49 households live in the same hamlet. There are no houses on the project area. In land - use structure,&#13;
cashew plantation covers an area of 13.78 ha (66.7%). Paddy - crop covers an area of 2.5 ha (12%),&#13;
other trees cover an area of 4.39 ha (21.3%). The number of PAPs affected by the power station area&#13;
is 305 of which 84% gain their main income from agriculture, 10% from service and small trade, and&#13;
6% from handicraft and other occupation. Most of the land under cultivation in the power station site&#13;
was newly - reclaimed from vacant land after 1975. Land - use certificates has not been issued to any&#13;
land - users. However, all plots have been surveyed and registered in the cadastral and tax payment&#13;
book of Town People's Committee. Therefore, there are no disputes over the land - use rights.&#13;
12.        The second major affected area of the temporary transmission line is the place where the&#13;
transmission line crosses the National Highway N°51. There are 9 households whose houses and their&#13;
properties are identified under the 21.6m right - of - way of transmission line. All these 9 households&#13;
(100 %) gain their living from agriculture. There are 4 households with brick - made houses, the rest&#13;
are households with thatched and timber structures.&#13;
13.        The power generating plant area has already been acquired and the first step of&#13;
compensation payment has been done, the second (last) will be done by the end of October, 1995. The&#13;
transmission line and fuel intake line ROW has not been acquired yet.&#13;
&#13;

14.        The Socio-Economic study, undertaken as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment&#13;
shows that while the affected people welcome the project and the economic development and&#13;
employment opportunities that this will create, the affected people expressed their concerns regarding&#13;
the level of compensation. For the success of the project such concerns should be covered by adequate&#13;
rates of compensation and suitable rehabilitation measures. This RAP was prepared after extensive&#13;
consultations with the project affected people, and the rates of compensation were only determined after&#13;
careful examination of the cost of replacement of similar land.&#13;
15.        This RAP defines the PAP, the resettlement principles and objectives, legal and&#13;
institutional framework, modes of compensation and rehabilitation, people's participation features and&#13;
grievances procedures that will guide the resettlement and rehabilitation of the PAPs. The RAP is based&#13;
on the results of the census and socio-economic survey of the PAPs and properties to be affected and&#13;
includes compensation and/or resettlement and rehabilitation entitlements of various categories of PAPs;&#13;
a timetable for implementation of the RAP; allocation of the institutional responsibilities for&#13;
implementation; a budget for funding the various compensation and rehabilitation measures, internal and&#13;
extemal monitoring arrangements. These components are detailed in the following parts and in the&#13;
Annex.&#13;
16.        The principle objective of this RAP is to ensure that all PAPs will be compensated and&#13;
rehabilitated to assist them to improve, or at least maintain, their living conditions and income earning&#13;
capacity at the pre-Project levels. The PAPs will be resettled as close as possible to the vicinity of their&#13;
original residential areas.&#13;
C -Project Affected People (PAP)&#13;
17.  The PAPs include the following persons:&#13;
(a)   persons whose residence is in part or in total affected by the Project;&#13;
(b)   persons whose premises and/or agricultural land is in part or in total affected (permanently&#13;
or temporarily) by the Project; and&#13;
(c)   persons whose businesses are affected in part or in total (temporarily or permanently) by&#13;
the Project.&#13;
D - Resettlement Principles and Objectives&#13;
18.        The principles outlined in the World Bank's Operational Directives 4.30 have been&#13;
adopted in preparing the RAP. In this regard the following principles and objectives have been applied:&#13;
(a)   Minimize adverse impact on the local population of acquisition by the project location and&#13;
project design.&#13;
(b)   All PAPs residing or cultivating land in the Project area as of the date of the socio-&#13;
economic survey are entitled to compensation and rehabilitation, and resettlement if&#13;
required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-109-&#13;
Annex 1 l&#13;
Page 6 of 16&#13;
(c)   PAPs will be compensated, resettled and rehabilitated so as to improve their standard of&#13;
living or at least maintain their current standard at pre-project levels.&#13;
(d)   The means of resettlement and rehabilitation are: Compensation at replacement cost for&#13;
houses and other structures, agricultural land for land of equal productive capacity&#13;
acceptable to the PAP. PAPs losing productive land will be given a choice among the&#13;
following alternatives: (i) land for land of equal productive capacity; or (ii) cash for land&#13;
and a choice to opt for land - based or non - land - based rehabilitation. For PAPs losing&#13;
house and premise land only, replacement of premise land of equal size acceptable to the&#13;
PAP, transfer allowance, and compensation for structures, trees, tombs, wells and other&#13;
fixed assets at replacement value.&#13;

SECTION 2&#13;
INSIMJTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
A -Institutional Framework&#13;
19.        The responsibilities for implementing the RAP are as follows:&#13;
(a)   EVN (or PMBRMB on its behalf) assumes the overall responsibility for planning and&#13;
imnplementing the RAP. For this purpose, PIDC2 provides technical consultancy support&#13;
for RAP planning. PMBRMB is responsible for co-ordinating with the Provincial People's&#13;
Committee (PPC) of Ba Ria Vung Tau, District People's Committee of Tan Thanh (DPC)&#13;
and Town People's Committee of Phu My (TPC). The Phu My TPC have held meetings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-110-&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Page 7 of 16&#13;
to discuss the various aspects of the RAP with the PAPs in the presence of PMBRMB&#13;
representatives.&#13;
(b)   Funds for the resettlement program will be provided by EVN based on decisions reached&#13;
through negotiations between local governments (provincial, district, and town people's&#13;
committees) and the PAPs.&#13;
(c)   EVN will implement the RAP in co-ordination with the Provincial, District, Town&#13;
People's Comnnittees and the participation of PAPs.&#13;
B - Legal Framework&#13;
20.        The overall objective of the RAP is guided by Article 27 of the Land Law of 1993 as&#13;
further amplified by Government Decree No 90-CP of 17th August 1994. Article 27 provides that: "In&#13;
case of utmost necessity, then the State recovers land being used by a land user, for national defence,&#13;
security, national benefit, or public benefit purposes, the land user shall be given compensation for the&#13;
damnages".&#13;
21.        Compensation for land and fixed assets (e.g. houses) is defined by the Government&#13;
Decrees No. 87-CP and 89-CP of the 17th of August 1994, which provide for land compensation and&#13;
cash for land, when land is not available, at rates established by Government. These rates have been&#13;
established for purposes of leasing government land, acquisition of land by government for national&#13;
purposes, and for tax computing on issuing land use rights certificates. Also, compensation for land&#13;
and fixed assets is defined by Decision 423/QD-UBT of March 30th 1993, Decision 31/QD-TJBT and&#13;
Decision 970/QD-UBT of the Ba Ria - Vung Tau People's Committee.&#13;
SECTION 3&#13;
ENTITLEMENT POLICY&#13;
22.        In respect to resettlement principles and objectives and based on PAP's census survey&#13;
(Table 1) PAP will be entitled to the following types of compensation and Resettlement and&#13;
Rehabilitation (R &amp; R) program, according to their entitlement categories.&#13;
(a)   PAPs losing agricultural land will have the choice between the following forms of&#13;
compensation:&#13;
(i)   either to be provided with land of equal productive capacity by the Peoples'&#13;
Committee of the District, satisfactory to the PAP. (the land-for-land option)&#13;
(ii)  or to be compensated in cash for the lost land at a rate that can provide for similar&#13;
type of land in the commune as mutually agreed between PAP and PC of Ba Ria&#13;
Vung Tau. (the cash-for-land option)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-lll-&#13;
Annex I 1&#13;
Page 8 of 16&#13;
23.          The PAP census showed that all PAPs expressed a clear preference in favour of cash-for-&#13;
land compensation. This supports their preference to select alternative land themselves rather than be&#13;
allocated alternative land by the Peoples' Committee. The location of the alternative land will be in the&#13;
vicinity of the commune. When the PAP have identified land, and agreed with the present land user that&#13;
the land should be registered in his/her name, the Townlet will arrange for this land to change land&#13;
user, without fees. The Townlet will monitor that the PAPs wanting land have been able to get land.&#13;
The cash rate of compensation has been calculated to meet the replacement value by taking the state -&#13;
authorized land - use value of 70 VND/m2 and adding the a production assistance of 5,930VND/m2 for&#13;
new land development in the transitional period. This comes to a total of 6,OOOVND (  0.55 $US) per&#13;
m2 of land. According to a survey of current rates for land - use transfer, and the PAPs, this is&#13;
adequate to secure new land in the vicinity.&#13;
(iii)  Compensation in cash at market price is to be provided for the loss of standing&#13;
crops and other trees, plus the assistance in cash equivalent to the lost production in&#13;
the transitional period to restore the original income depending on the maturity and&#13;
quality of the existing plants and trees. The average compensation cost per tree, as&#13;
well as the production assistance for the trees to restore the present production are&#13;
shown in Table A. The production assistance is calculated as a product of the&#13;
number of years to bear fruit and the average annual income from the trees.&#13;

The above rates have been negotiated with the PAPs and are acceptable to them.&#13;
(b)   PAP losing agricultural land will be provided economic rehabilitation of their own&#13;
choosing through various activities in support of their requests.&#13;
(i)    For those PAP opting for land based rehabilitation, whenever required, the local&#13;
committee will assist them in securing the alternative land with necessary&#13;
procedures like official witnessing and registration. The local committee will&#13;
monitor progress to ensure that PAPs have acquired land of their choice. If PAPs&#13;
opt for land in the conunune or nearby area then adequate land will be available.&#13;
The land in these areas are of better quality than the land currently used by the&#13;
PAP. Hence, it is expected that the compensation areas will permit more intensive&#13;
&#13;

use of the alternative land and therefore yield higher incomes to the PAPs&#13;
concerned The requisite nursary trees are available in the market at very low&#13;
prices.&#13;
(ii)  Those PAPs opting for non - land based rehabilitation will be provided&#13;
opportunities of employment, training and starting new occupations, as well as the&#13;
assistance needed in order to maintain their living standard. PMBRMB will present&#13;
PAPs seeking employment to the contractors engaged in construction of PM2, and&#13;
co-operate with local authorities in fmding employment opportunities for PAPs.&#13;
EVN has recently started a two year residential course for operation of power plant&#13;
staff, where suitable PAPs have been accepted. PAPs opting to start their own&#13;
business (food etc.) will be assisted by EVN and local PCs with registration, tax&#13;
exemptions in the beginning years. EVN will also be responsible for providing fees&#13;
for training to the PAP in relevant occupations at local vocational training centers,&#13;
planned to start early 1996. The training would cover technical training (like&#13;
tailoring, electrical repair, carpentry) and business training (like running of small&#13;
enterprises, marketing and finance).&#13;
(c)   PAPs whose house is affected by the project transmission or fuel lines and forced to&#13;
relocate will be entitled as follows:&#13;
(i)   A equivalent residential site, acceptable to the PAP and cash compensation at full&#13;
replacement cost for the affected structures and fixed assets without depreciation.&#13;
The PAP will be allowed to take material from the site before it has to be vacated.&#13;
(ii)   A transfer allowance of about 1 million VND or more for the relocation of the&#13;
affected house to new resettlement site.&#13;
(iii)  Land not directly acquired for construction (of transmission poles, etc) but is in the&#13;
right of way can be used by the current user for cultivation, grazing and other&#13;
activities, and will normally not be compensated. However, as height restrictions of&#13;
4 meters will have to be observed by the user in all future, trees above that height&#13;
will be removed and compensated as above. Because of the restrictions in land use,&#13;
the PAP will receive a one-time lumpsum 'restriction-fee' of at least 70 VND/m'.&#13;
(iii) Any damage caused to PAP's properties and crops during project construction&#13;
period will be compensated at market price by Contractor.&#13;
SECTION 4&#13;
PEOPLE'S PARTICIPATION IN THE PROJECT&#13;
24.        There are various stages in the RAP planning and implementation activities that require the&#13;
PAP participation. This was encouraged by favourable conditions created by PMBRMB and the&#13;
respective conmnittees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-113-&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Page 10 of 16&#13;
25.        The PAPs were adequately informed by the relevant local peoples committees of the&#13;
details of the RAP and meetings were held as follows:&#13;
Dec. 14, 1994    PAPs informed by local Peoples Committee (PC) on project impacts&#13;
June 25, 1995   PAPs representatives (7 households) met with Tan Thanh PC.&#13;
August, 1995    On site verification of losses. The procedure of verifying the number of&#13;
trees, their age, etc, and determining the value was done with the&#13;
participation of the concerned PAP, representatives of the local Peoples'&#13;
Committees (District and Towniet), and an independent consultant.&#13;
Sep. 9, 1995    PAPs met with PC of Phu My Townlet, Rehabilitation Committee of Baria-&#13;
Vung Tau Province, Tan Thanh District and PMBRMB representatives.&#13;
26.        PAPs were specifically informed about the choice available to them and their subsequent&#13;
choice was recorded.&#13;
27.        The PAP's participation included their attendance in the meetings jointly held by&#13;
PMBRMB and the respective people's committee in order to learn of the project impacts, obtain their&#13;
co-operation in providing adequate information on affected matters, and to give their suggestions for&#13;
RAP planning.&#13;
28.        The crucial PAP's participation is their agreement upon the finalisation of RAP. This&#13;
includes their consensus in joining the consultancy process to mutually arrange compensation choices&#13;
and rates, and the commitment to the implemnentation arrangenent with the respective people's&#13;
committee and PMBRMB in the spirit of current law and the R &amp; R policies.&#13;
29.        The final participation that is also important, is the PAP's co-operation with respective&#13;
people's committee and PMBRMB in implementing RAP and resolving any issue that may arise in the&#13;
process.&#13;

Remark: The above percentage of land loss is only taken in comparison to the total agricultural&#13;
land area in Phu My commune fields belonging to h. holds.&#13;
31.       Incomes of PAPs are expected to improve due to new ability to intensify agricultural&#13;
production ( in the case of those opting for land-based rehabilitation) or due to the potential offered by&#13;
small scale enterprise. Typical incomes from small scale trading is 7.2 million VNDJyear and for food&#13;
services, 12 million VND/year. Construction firm labour income is about 9.8 million VND/year.&#13;

IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENT&#13;
A - Resettlement and Construction Schedule&#13;
32.        The PAPs have been informed by project authorities and/or LPCs about the detailed&#13;
description of project impacts and the properties to be acquired . Payment of compensation for crops,&#13;
trees and other properties, allotment of land for construction of relocated houses, and replacement land&#13;
of equal productive capacity, will be completed before the affected people will be evicted from the land&#13;
and construction can start on the affected area.&#13;
B - Implementation Arrangements&#13;
33.        Implementation of the Resettlement and Compensation (RIC) program will be a joint effort&#13;
of EVN and it's subsidiary (PMBRMB), the Provincial Peoples Committees (PPC), District peoples'&#13;
Committees (DPC) and the commune authorities. The overall responsibility for implementing the RAP&#13;
will be that of EVN. EVN will exercise its functions through MB of PMBRMB. Though most of the&#13;
activities will be carried out in close co-ordination with the Peoples' Committees at various levels, the&#13;
officials of EVN and of PMBRMB will ensure that implementation complies with the RAP (Par 45).&#13;
EVN will be responsible for co-ordinating the disbursement of funds. The funds would be disbursed to&#13;
the people directly by PPCs, with the Local Peoples Committee Representatives acting as a witness.&#13;
34.        The PPCs will inform the concerned district about the resettlement program and direct it&#13;
to take the steps necessary for compensation and resettlement of the PAP. The DPCs will inform the&#13;
PAP and the respective communes about the project and the R/C program and co-ordinate its activities.&#13;
35.        PMBRMB and PIDC2 have carried out a socio-economic survey on PAP covering the&#13;
following information:&#13;
(a)   The losses of PAP's land, properties, crops.&#13;
(b)   PAP's claims on compensation choices and compensation rates.&#13;
(c)   PAP's aspiration for R/C.&#13;
36.        The PPCs are responsible for checking and fixing compensation amounts for various types&#13;
of affected properties in agreement with PAP and in accordance with the principles of this RAP.&#13;
Payment of compensation will be supervised by PPC &amp; PMBRMB and its agencies. Allotment of&#13;
alternative lands for PAP's house relocation will be the responsibility of the DPCs.&#13;
37.        The town authorities will be in charge of informing the PAPs about the RAP&#13;
implementation schedule, and to redress their grievances and to act as a communication link between&#13;
the PAPs and the DPCs, PPCs, EVN &amp; PMBRMB. Most routine activities will be co-ordinated&#13;
directly by the town and district authorities. EVN will finance the total cost of the RAP and ensure the&#13;
timnely availability of funds. Table 8 in the Annex shows the activities which need to be carried out as&#13;
a part of the R/C program and the organisation(s) responsible for it.&#13;

38.         With regard to economic rehabilitation of PAPs, it is important to note that the area is an&#13;
rapid growth area, with several new employment opportunities emerging. Not only from the power&#13;
plant development, but from several industries already established in the area (e.g. Vinakyoei Steel&#13;
Mill). As noted earlier, the Townlet of Phu My was established in August last year, in order to&#13;
facilitate the economic growth of the area, and the local PC have made several plans for improving the&#13;
general as well as the technical educational facilities. Many PAPs, and especially their teen-age&#13;
children, have expressed their desire for changing their sources of income from agriculture to off-farm&#13;
employment, either in the opportunities established by incoming industries or by self-employment to&#13;
render services to these enterprises and their workers. Therefore the challenge of the economic&#13;
rehabilitation program of this RAP is to ensure that PAPs avail of the opportunities that are being&#13;
created in the area. This require general education, vocational training, access to credit, and initial&#13;
extension support. The major responsibility for implementing these measures lies with the PC of the&#13;
Townlet and the district, and funding will be provided by EVN.&#13;
39.         The first step in this process will be to carry out a detailed survey of the capacity, wishes&#13;
and plans of PAP households. Every person, belonging to an affected household, between 16 and 50&#13;
years of age will be offered assistance for economic rehabilitation to be availed of within a two year&#13;
period from the time of the survey. Based on this survey, a rehabilitation plan will be worked out for&#13;
the PAPs. This survey will be carried out by the agency that EVN will contract for external monitoring&#13;
and evaluation during November-December 1995.&#13;

D - Complaints and Grievancs&#13;
41.          Complaints and grievances related to any aspect of the RAP will be handled through&#13;
negotiations aimed at achieving consensus.&#13;
42.          Settlement between the PAP and local government will be first attempted at the level of&#13;
the Commune. If this first conciliation attempt fails, the case will be discussed a second time at the&#13;
District level. If at the District level the case is not resolved, an ad-hoc committee established by the&#13;
PPC will decide the matter&#13;
43.          In case where, despite the above efforts, no agreement is reached between the parties, the&#13;
case will be submitted to the District court.&#13;
44.          PAPs who present their cases to the Commnune, District and Provincial authorities, will be&#13;
exempted from any legal fees. PAPs, who bring their case to the District Court, will have to follow the&#13;
prevailing laws.&#13;

E - Supervision and Monitoring&#13;
45.        Implementation of the RAP will be regularly supervised and monitored by EVN in co-&#13;
ordination with the respective local peoples committees.  An agency nominated by EVN, namely&#13;
PMBRMB will periodically carry out internal monitoring and evaluation. External monitoring will be&#13;
done by an organisation such as an academic or a research institution, an NGO or an independent&#13;
consulting firm. They will be identified and hired in November 1995, prior to commencement of&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
46.        Internal monitoring and supervision will:&#13;
(a)   verify that the census and socio-economic survey of all PAPs has been carried out and that&#13;
property assessment and compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation has been carried out&#13;
in accordance with the provisions of the RAP;&#13;
(b)   oversee that RAP is implemented as approved;&#13;
(c)   verify that funds for implementing the RAP are provided in a timely manner, are&#13;
sufficient for their purposes, and are spent in accordance with the provisions of the RAP.&#13;
(d)  ensure that all PAPs opting for land-based rehabilitation have been able to secure land and&#13;
all those opting for non-land-based rehabilitation have been set up in their new&#13;
occupations; and&#13;
(e)   monitor the implementation of training to the PAPs.&#13;
47.        In addition to verifying the reports generated by the internal monitoring, the extemal&#13;
nonitoring agency will carry out the following tasks:&#13;
(a)  evaluate the initial social and economic impact of land acquisition and assess the training&#13;
needs of PAPs, based on which a training programme, availing of existing institutions will&#13;
be proposed;&#13;
(b)   verify if the objective of enhancement or at least restoration of income levels and&#13;
standards of living of the PAPs has been met; and&#13;
(c)  suggest modification in RAP implementation to achieve the principles and objectives set&#13;
forth in of this RAP.&#13;
48.        Monitoring activities will start from the time the PAPs have been compensated and will&#13;
continue for a period of about five years. The extemal monitoring agency will undertake surveys on an&#13;
annual basis and produce reports.&#13;

A - Budget for RAP activities&#13;
49.           Timely availability of funds for carrying out surveys, payment of compensation, allotment&#13;
of alternative sites and transfer of houses to new sites is crucial for effective implementation of the&#13;
RAP. It is the responsibility of EVN to ensure that adequate funds for implementing the RAP are&#13;
available on schedule. Table 10 provides an estimnate of the RAP costs.&#13;

Environmental Analysis for Installation of Transformers&#13;
1.         All transformer sub-stations in Viet Nam follow the Vietnamese Environmental and Safety&#13;
Regulations for these installations. All installations are subject to approval of the Electrical Inspector.&#13;
The design and layouts of substations at rated voltage of 110 kV and above are subject to approval by&#13;
the Fire Protection Authority. The following are some of the environmental and safety measures&#13;
followed:&#13;
(a)   Provision of fire partition walls if distance between two transformers is less than 25&#13;
meters (mainly applicable for 220 kV substations).&#13;
(b)   Provision of retention basins with gravel below transformers for quenching burning oil in&#13;
the event of fire (for transformers 25MVA and above).&#13;
(c)   Provision of automatic fire protection system including a sump tank for transformers rated&#13;
220 kV and above.&#13;
(d)   Provision of adequate safety clearances for all high voltage equipment.&#13;
(e)   Use of only oil-less or minimum oil circuit breakers indoors.&#13;
(f)   Specification of Noise Level (70db) for transformers.&#13;
PCB is not used in transformers or switchgear in Viet Nam.&#13;
2.         The installation of transformers and associated switchgear at existing sub-stations pose no&#13;
significant environmental risks nor create any significant environmental impacts.&#13;

over 1995-2000 would be around 12.8% for the North; 16% for the South; and 15% for the&#13;
Center or an average increase of 14.6% p.a. for the country as a whole.&#13;
Losses&#13;
2.         Average technical and non-technical losses currently at about 21 % of generation (of&#13;
which non-technical losses are about 3%) are projected to be maintained at 21% until 1997 and to&#13;
be reduced to 20% in 1998; to 18% in 1999-2000; and to 17% in 2001.&#13;
Tariff&#13;
3.         The average price of electricity is about D 580/kWh, or about 5.3 USc/kWh. The&#13;
financial projections assume that tariffs would be progressively raised to an average level of 7&#13;
USc/kWh by 1999 as proposed by the Government. Assuming a 5% annual depreciation of the&#13;
Dong vis-a-vis the dollar, this tariff in 1999 would be about D 944/kWh.&#13;
Cost of Fuel&#13;
4.         Cost of fuel includes the cost of coal, heavy fuel, diesel and gas consumed by EVN's&#13;
thernal generating facilities. The fuel mix is based on EVN's generation plan. The base fuel&#13;
costs as of July 1995 are as follows: (a) Coal - US$42 per MT; (b) Heavy fuel oil - US$140 per&#13;
MT; (c) Diesel oil - US$280 per MT; and (d) Gas - US$2.5 per MMBTU.&#13;
Salaries, Wages and Benefits&#13;
5.         EVN records base salaries, wages and benefits in the Income Statement; staff,&#13;
however, also draws bonuses which are not recorded in the costs of the Income Statement.&#13;
Consistent with the practice of other state-owned enterprises in Viet Nam, EVN will distribute&#13;
20% of its profits to employees as bonuses. In the financial projections, this allocation of profit is&#13;
not carried forward to retained earnings but instead is recorded as current payables to employees&#13;
and treated as a reduction from funds generated from operations in the Funds Flow Statement.&#13;

Other Operating Expenses&#13;
6.         Other Operating Expenses are based on current EVN experience, with projections for&#13;
future plants based on historical costs for similar plants and escalated with inflation rates of 10%&#13;
per annum.&#13;
Taxes&#13;
7.         Taxes are based on current levels as follows: (a) Tax on Revenues (Turnover Tax) at&#13;
8% of total revenues; (b) Tax on Natural Resources (Royalty Tax) at 2% of that part of revenue&#13;
from sales of power which corresponds to the percentage of hydro generation versus total&#13;
generation; (c) Tax on Capital at 2.4% of total Government capital; and (d) Income Tax at 25%.&#13;
Depredation&#13;
8.         Depreciation rates are prescribed by the Government and calculated on the following&#13;
basis: turbines (8%), rockfill dams (2%), concrete dams (3%), and distributionsystems (8.5%).&#13;
Capital Investment&#13;
9.         Projected capital expenditures are those estimated to provide the additional plant and&#13;
equipment required to meet the demand forecast, escalated in accordance with the latest projection&#13;
of inflation rates. These expenditures are projected by EVN in accordance with the power&#13;
development plan.&#13;
Capital Structure&#13;
10.        The following capital structure is assumed:  (a) existing Government capital and&#13;
Enterprise capital remain as equity; (b) capital balance remains unchanged for the duration of the&#13;
projected period; (c) starting FY95 new investments are assumed to be financed at two-thirds debt;&#13;
(d) interests on outstanding loans are assumed to be totally capitalized; (e) long termn debts are&#13;
assumed to have an annual interest rate of 8% per annum and repaynent tems of up to 15 years&#13;
including two years of grace; and (f) no dividend payments on equity are assumed.&#13;
Fixed Assets&#13;
11.        Due to doubtful past valuation procedures, fixed assets as recorded may not represent&#13;
the fair value of the assets at the time of transfer from the PCs to EVN. Consequently, the&#13;
financial projections are based on fixed assets values provided by EVN as available at the end of&#13;
March 31, 1995.&#13;
Current Assets&#13;
12.        Accounts receivable are projected to be approximately one month of total revenues&#13;
while stocks are assumed to be one-eighth of total revenues.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Power
            Development Project are to: 1) help meet the rapid growth in
            electricity demand in the South of Viet Nam through the
            addition of new gas-fired generating capacity; 2) strengthen
            the high voltage (HV) transformation capacity in Viet Nam;
            3) assist the government in the introduction of private
            power in the country; 4) strengthen the institutional
            capacity of Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) through technical
            assistance and training; and 5) assist in the formulation of
            a national strategy and master plan for rural
            electrification. The project will finance the following
            components: 1) installation of 2x150 megawatt (MW) gas
            turbines for the first 450 MW Combined Cycle (CC) power
            block of the Phu My power station; 2) addition of about 900
            megavolt-amperes (MVA) of such capacity in other parts of
            the country; 3) resettlement and compensation of persons
            affected by the Phu My plant; and 4) consulting services
            for: (a) project design and supervision for Phu My; (b)
            development of a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) type of
            arrangement for the second CC power block of Phu My on the
            basis of competitive bidding; (c) technical assistance and
            training for EVN managerial staff; (d) master plan for rural
            electrification; and (e) technical studies for the Dai Ninh
            hydropower project.
