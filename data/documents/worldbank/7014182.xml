Project development objective Re$ PAD B.1,Annex 3&#13;
The project will support and constitutes an integral part o f a national program to increase&#13;
Romaniak avian and human influenza preparedness, i.e. the country's capacity to prevent and&#13;
control the spread o f influenza among animals and humans.Inthis context, the overall&#13;
development objective o f the project i s to reduce the threat posed to humans and the poultry&#13;
sector inRomania by HPAIand other zoonoses, and to support the preparation for, control of,&#13;
and response to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies inhumans. To&#13;
achieve this, the project will support activities inthe three areas o fprevention, preparedness and&#13;
contingency planning, response and containment under the three components: (i)          animal health;&#13;
(ii) health;and(iii) awareness,communicationsandimplementationsupport.&#13;

2.      Evaluation o fNational Veterinary Services. The organizational and functional review o f&#13;
the main governmental veterinary services undertaken by experts from EUmember countries&#13;
andinternational organizations, andthe rapidassessmentundertakenbythe Bank team, suggest&#13;
the need for an in-depthassessment o f the national veterinary services, followed by appropriate&#13;
reforms as may be warranted. To meet international standards set by the World Organization for&#13;
Animal Health (OIE), the EUrequirements, and the recommendations developed by FA0 and&#13;
EUexperts, the veterinary services needto develop and document appropriateprocedures and&#13;
standards for the implementation and management o f animal health measures and international&#13;
veterinary certification activities. As a basis for activities insupport o f institutional&#13;
enhancements (below), the project will provide technical assistance to support the self-evaluation&#13;

Veterinary Services'' evaluation guidelines'inorder to establish the current level o fperformance,&#13;
form a shared vision with service providers and clients inthe private sector, establish priorities,&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
andfacilitate strategic planning.&#13;
&#13;
3.      StrengtheningVeterinary and Food Safety Institutions. Once the evaluation o f veterinary&#13;
andrelated services (above) has been completed, the project will provide technical support for&#13;
realigning institutional structures and resources with priority objectives, mandates, and tasks. In&#13;
collaboration with and complementary to ongoing and planned advisory activities fundedby&#13;
donors and international organizations, the project will provide technical assistance for&#13;
institutional and organizational restructuring at national and county levels as may be warranted;&#13;
training o f staff; equipment and materials. Inparticular, the project will support the&#13;
establishment o f animal disease control centers at the national and county levels.&#13;
&#13;
A 2 - ImprovingHPAIPrevention and Control Planning (EUR 0.35 million)&#13;
&#13;
4.       Contingency Plan Implementation Guidelines and Manuals. While governmental&#13;
authorities have developed individual contingency plans for animal and humanhealth, overall&#13;
national contingency planning and coordination still needs improvements. The Government has&#13;
established a National Disease (AI) Control Center that has started a comprehensive process o f&#13;
reviewing, integrating, and consolidating existingcontingency plans. The project will provide&#13;
technical assistance to support this process o f refining and finalizing the draft contingency&#13;
plan(s) and to develop the necessary detailed implementation guidelines and manuals for&#13;
relevant agencies and services.&#13;
&#13;
(B)      StrengtheningDisease Surveillance, Diagnostic Capacity, and Research&#13;
&#13;
B1- StrengtheningMonitoring and Surveillance Systems (EURO0.18 million)&#13;
&#13;
5.       Surveillance Capacity o f Veterinary Services. The project will provide technical&#13;
assistance and training for staff o f veterinary service institutions at national and local levels,&#13;
focusing on the structured routine collection o f samples on a national scale, on intensive follow-&#13;
up sampling around outbreaks areas, as well as routine investigation o f deadwild birdsthat are&#13;
regularly collected for such purposes (support for serological testing under active surveillance&#13;
schemes i s provided under the diagnostic capacity component B 2 and support to local mobility i s&#13;
provided under the institutional strengtheningcomponent Al).&#13;
&#13;
6.       Epidemiological Surveys. The second wave o f HPAIoutbreaks inRomania, starting on&#13;
May 11,2006, has shown that the lack o freliable epidemiological information, and the sound&#13;
analysis thereof, has hampered the development o f rational, targeted disease control measures&#13;
and slowed down the containment o fthe disease. The project will provide technical assistance&#13;
and training for epidemiological studies and surveillance programs to support decision makers in&#13;
continuously fine-tuning and improving disease control measures based on improved risk&#13;
assessment. InRomania where 70% o fpoultry i s produced inbackyard systems, small-scale and&#13;
semi-commercial poultry production systems are the major control target.&#13;
&#13;
B 2 - StrengtheningDiagnostic Capacity (EUR 8.14 million)&#13;
&#13;
7.       Diagnostic capacity inRomania's national reference laboratory (IDAH) and county&#13;
laboratories. Inorder to equip existing laboratories for the increased work loadunder active&#13;
surveillance schemes and to minimize the lengtho f the period between infection and control&#13;
action (i.e. the highrisk period being the time needed for detection, reporting, sampling, testing,&#13;
and decision-making for response), the project will finance priority laboratory equipment and&#13;
laboratory consumables including samplingkits, materials for transporting and conditioning o f&#13;
samples, reagents, as well as technical assistance and training, inorder to increase the capacity&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
for virology and serological tests, screening surveys for the confirmation o f the disease and the&#13;
preparation for the differentiation o f AI sub-types. The sub-component will also provide personal&#13;
protective and laboratory waste disposal equipment. Twinning arrangements with appropriate&#13;
institutions outside Romania will be explored inorder to facilitate sustained capacity&#13;
strengthening.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Quality control o f veterinary medicinal products. This sub-component will provide&#13;
equipment, consumables, technical assistance and training for increasingthe capacity o fthe&#13;
Institute for Control o f Biological Products and Veterinary Drugsto fulfillits responsibility in&#13;
providing quality control for vaccines and other veterinary medicinal products for which formal&#13;
quality assurance has to be provided by the State.&#13;
&#13;
B3 - Strengthening Animal Diseases Information Systems (EUR 2.23 million)&#13;
&#13;
9.       This sub-component will support the development o f a comprehensive integrated national&#13;
animal disease information system which will enable Romania to participate inglobal disease&#13;
information sharing and comply with its obligations as a member o f OIE, contributing towards&#13;
progressively better global and regional control and eradication. The system will be linked with&#13;
rapid and standardized methods o f routine analysis o f surveillance data inorder to track&#13;
important changes inthe H5N1situation and promptly supply this information to field personnel.&#13;
The system supported under the project i s intended to enable an effective and efficient flow o f&#13;
information among relevant agencies and individuals (esp. field veterinarians, laboratory experts,&#13;
epidemiologists, etc.), providingthe necessary support to decision-makers charged with the&#13;
prevention and control o f animal diseases at local and national levels. The project will provide&#13;
technical assistance, priority equipment and supplies, and training, for the design, establishment&#13;
and use o f the system. The animal health information system also includes a geo-referenced&#13;
database for all poultry farms, confirming to the requirement ofmunicipalities to register all&#13;
backyard flocks under their authority.&#13;
&#13;
B4 - StrengtheningApplied Veterinary Research Capacity (EUR 0.3 1million)&#13;
&#13;
10.    Applied Veterinary Research Program. A Government Decision under preparation at the&#13;
time o f project appraisal i s to provide ANSVSA inthe near future with a new mandate on&#13;
establishing the Research Center for Cross border Diseases, Emergencies, Reemergence and&#13;
Zoonoses o f the Institute for Diagnosis and Animal Health, situated on premises at Tulcea. This&#13;
sub-component will be limited to the provision o f preparatory support to initiate applied research&#13;
on epidemiology, birdmigration and ecology, and other subjects related to HPAI(and other&#13;
zoonotic diseases) byproviding technical assistance for ANSVSA to assist with the design a&#13;
research program as well as to assist with the design, construction and refurbishment plans for&#13;
the physical facilities for the Research Center. Twinning arrangements with appropriate&#13;
institutions outside Romania will be explored inorder to facilitate sustained capacity&#13;
strengthening. Upon completion o f the design additional project funds may be made available&#13;
subject to a separate request and subsequent appraisal.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Infectious disease research on live animals. Research with highlyinfectious agents (such&#13;
as HPAIvirus) on live animals - as may be required for the testing o f vaccines and the practicing&#13;
o f vaccination and post-vaccination sampling - requires a high-containment laboratory&#13;
environment. The project will finance goods, consumables, and civil works for minor&#13;
refurbishments inexistinglaboratory facilities for the installation and operation o f isolators at the&#13;
Institute for Control o f Biological Products and Veterinary Drugs.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(C)     StrengtheningHPAIControl Programs&#13;
&#13;
C1 - Targeting Virus Eradication at the Source (EUR 1.47 million)&#13;
&#13;
12.     Quarantine, Culling and Disposal. Although capable teams are inplace to effectively&#13;
control HPAIoutbreaks, the recent wave o f out outbreaks has overwhelmed authorities and&#13;
veterinary services. The wide distribution o f small flocks across a country where 70% o fpoultry&#13;
are produced inbackyard systems i s a particular challenge for the control o f the disease. The&#13;
project will contribute to the enhancement o f existing capacities for the control o f HPAI&#13;
outbreaks as requiredby existing national contingency plans. Weaknesses have been identified in&#13;
the areas o f quarantining (disinfection stations), culling o f infectedand at-risk poultry, and the&#13;
safe disposal of poultry carcasses and potentially infectious materials ina bio-secure and&#13;
environmentally acceptable manner. Disinfection practices will be improved with support from&#13;
other thanproject sources. The project will focus its assistance on the culling o fpoultry and on&#13;
the disposal o fcarcasses insmall-holder systems - which dominate Romania'spoultry sector.&#13;
The project will finance the purchase and operation o f containers where C 0 2 i s applied inan&#13;
animal welfare acceptable manner. The project will also finance the purchase and operation o f&#13;
mobileincineratorswith a combined daily capacity o f about 40,000 kg.&#13;
&#13;
C2 - Supporting Poultry Vaccination Campaigns (EUR 0.10 million)&#13;
&#13;
13.     Vaccination planning andimplementation. A policy on the use o f vaccination for the&#13;
containment o f HPAIoutbreaks has not yet been formulated. Insituations where other measures&#13;
failed to control the spread o f the disease and where the virus has become endemic, vaccination&#13;
mightinfuture become an option for the containment o fthe disease. The project will therefore&#13;
provide technical assistance and training to develop Romania's vaccination policy, contingency&#13;
plan and implementation manuals inthe context o f its near-future EUmembership,and train&#13;
officials, as a contingency planning exercise, inthe implementation o fpoultry vaccination&#13;
campaigns andpost-vaccination monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
(D)     Improving Bio-security inpoultry production and trade (EUR 0.29 million)&#13;
&#13;
14.     Bio-security on small-scale poultry farms. The level o f bio-security both on commercial&#13;
and on backyard farms is insufficient and represents a major risk for new waves o f infections.&#13;
The project will support enhancements o fbio-security on small-holder farms with the following&#13;
instruments:(i)   Bio-security on poultry farms is - primarily - the result o f managerial decisions&#13;
and behavior (such as restricted access to poultry production farms, quarantining of new&#13;
purchases, separation o f sick animals, separation of species, personal hygiene, etc). The project&#13;
will therefore support awareness campaigns andknowledge transfer activities - includingon-&#13;
farm demonstrations and training o f farmers, extension agents, and other rural services providers&#13;
- aimed at managerial and behavioral changes. (ii) project will also finance technical&#13;
                                                      The&#13;
assistance for a comprehensive poultry sector assessment which - together with improved&#13;
epidemiological evidence - will help shape state support to increased bio-security on small-&#13;
holder farms. This study will assess the structure o f the poultryproduction sector, assess bio-&#13;
security issues indifferent production systems, and formulate technical options for upgrading on-&#13;
farm bio-security, especially insmall-holdings. It will result inthe publication o f biosecurity&#13;
manuals for different stakeholders (iii)  Investment incentives (on a matching grant basis) for&#13;
infrastructure upgrades on small-holder farms incompliance with enhanced bio-security&#13;
requirements (such as fencing, compartmentalization, caging, and manure disposal.), based on&#13;
the results o f the poultry sector assessment and successful pilot activities, could be an option for&#13;
project follow-up activities and were endorsed by the appraisal mission but have not been&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
included inthe final project design.&#13;
COMPONENT 2: HUMANHEALTH&#13;
&#13;
15.      The HumanHealth Component will comprise three subcomponents for a total estimated&#13;
cost o f EUR 19.80 million, with Bank financing inthe amount o f EUR 16.95 million:&#13;
&#13;
(A)      Enhancing Public Health Program Planning and Coordination (EUR 0.16 million)&#13;
&#13;
16.      Activities under the first subcomponent will aim at enhancing coordination and program&#13;
planning by providing financial and technical support for additional studies and research as well&#13;
as for conferences andworkshops, including the organization o f a regional coordination meeting&#13;
on preparations for a human influenza pandemic.&#13;
&#13;
(B)      Strengthening o f National Public Health Surveillance Systems (EUR 1.26 million)&#13;
&#13;
17.      The second subcomponent will help strengthen the national public surveillance system&#13;
by: (i) Upgrading o f the National Influenza Laboratory to BSL 3 through the financing o f minor&#13;
civil works (partitioning andcreation o f decontamination rooms), the supply and installation of&#13;
additional security devices, and the installation o f a system for maintaining negative pressure in&#13;
the rooms; and (ii)  Strengthening o f regional laboratoriesbyprovidingcritical equipment and&#13;
training o f staff.&#13;
&#13;
(C)      StrengtheningHealth System Response Capacity (EUR 18.29 million)&#13;
&#13;
18.      The third subcomponent will help strengthen the capacity o fthe healthcare system to&#13;
respond to the disease, through:&#13;
&#13;
(i)      The strengtheningo fthe isolation and case management capacity inbothnational and&#13;
regionalhospitals. The project will finance equipment for the intensive oare units o f the two&#13;
Bucharest infectious diseases hospitals and the establishment o f isolation and intensive care units&#13;
inthe 7 regional centers for infectious diseases (Brasov, Craiova, Constanta, Cluj, Iasi,&#13;
Timisoara and Tg. Mures). According to the National Plan, during the inter-pandemic period, all&#13;
suspected cases shall be transported to and isolated at the Institute o f Infectious Diseases ProfDr&#13;
Matei Bals, where medical assistance can be providedby specialized dedicatedpersonnel. The&#13;
centralization o fpatient care is the only possible way at this point intime as there i s no medical&#13;
unit able to ensure highquality care to suspected or confirmed AIhumancases inthe rest o fthe&#13;
country. However, inthe future, patients would have to be hospitalized within their region o f&#13;
residence. Therefore, there is a need to develop isolation and intensive care capacities inthe&#13;
regional centers for infectious diseases.&#13;
&#13;
(ii) TheupgradingoftheinfluenzavaccineproductionunitattheCantacuzinoInstitute&#13;
including the rehabilitation and equipment o f the influenzaproduction department, and the&#13;
completion and equipment o fthe filling and sealing unit. A significant part o f the vaccines&#13;
needed inRomania duringthe inter-pandemic and pandemic periods can be producedby the&#13;
Cantacuzino Institute. Makingthe Institute able to significantly increase up to 2.5 million doses&#13;
andits production infullcompliance with GMP standards requires the upgrading o fboththe&#13;
production unit and the filling and sealing station. This intervention will help both to increase the&#13;
production capacity and to ensure that the production i s at the required Good Manufacturing&#13;
Practice standards.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 COMPONENT 3:            PUBLIC AWARENESS, COMMUNICATION, AND&#13;
 IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT&#13;
&#13;
 (A)     Public Awareness and Communication (EUR 1.64 million)&#13;
&#13;
 19.     The Public Awareness and Communication Sub-component will support the GOR's&#13;
 efforts indesigning and implementing an integrated and comprehensive communications&#13;
 strategy and action plan. The component will be implemented by ANSVSA, and will comprise&#13;
 the following three sub-components:&#13;
&#13;
 (i)     Strengthening institutional capacity for ANSVSA: the project will support assistance for&#13;
 and training o f communications staff, and additional equipment and operating costs for the&#13;
 communications teams inthe two agencies.&#13;
&#13;
 (ii) Developmentofanintegratedcommunicationsstrategyandactionplanforbothhuman&#13;
 andanimal health based on qualitative and quantitative research: the project will build on the&#13;
 experience gained from the information campaigns of UNDP, UNICEF, USAID, as well as on&#13;
 the sectoral communications strategies o f WHO and UNICEF, and the communications needs&#13;
 assessment of ANSVSA. The strategy will define parameters o f specific audiences invarious&#13;
 generic target groups, the degree o f social acceptance o f proposed hygiene and bio-security&#13;
 measures, the associated messages which will need to be persuasive without creating panic, and&#13;
 the most efficient delivery tools andvehicles for a nation wide campaign.&#13;
&#13;
 (iii) Deliveryofseveralinformationcampaigns:thesewillaimtoobtainthepublic'ssupport&#13;
 and participation inreporting andmonitoring; to promote and induce a set o f behavior changes&#13;
 which will diminishthe possibility of AI outbreaks and contamination; and to educate different&#13;
 key audiences (farmers, people living invillages, traders, local authorities, media, food&#13;
 inspectors, front line workers, consumers, other stakeholders). The campaigns, even iftargeted&#13;
 especially for HPAI, will leadto other important positive externalities. The proposedbio-&#13;
 security measures and associated campaigns will also affect the spreading and prevention o f&#13;
 other animal diseases such as Newcastle disease, Classical swine fever, or Rabies, and will&#13;
 provide support for other on-going ANSVSA programs such as animal welfare, identification&#13;
 and registration o f animals and traceability. Also, the campaigns will improvethe general&#13;
 hygiene and sanitation of the population. Inclose collaboration with and complementary to the&#13;
 animal health related and overall coordination activities supported under the project, human&#13;
 health related communications activities will be entirely financed through USAID support and&#13;
 from governmental budgetsunderMOPH.&#13;
1(B)     Implementation Support, Monitoring and Evaluation (EUR 1.82 million)&#13;
&#13;
 20.     The project will be implemented by the MOPH and ANSVSA, buildingupon their&#13;
 experience with implementingother bank financed projects. Inorder to ensure effective&#13;
 implementation o f the project inaccordance with Bank fiduciary and procurement policies and&#13;
 guidelines, the project will finance: (i)&#13;
                                         Incremental support interms o f staff and operating costs&#13;
 to the existing project management unit within MPH and the project management unit to be&#13;
 established withinANSVSA; (ii)     Studies, technical services, manuals; and (iii) Surveys for&#13;
 monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
 Which safeguard policies are triggered, if any? Re$ PAD D.4,Annex 8&#13;
&#13;
 21.     Activities financed under the proposedproject are not expected to generate any&#13;
 significant adverse environmental effect, as a large part of the project i s gearedto support&#13;
 prevention activities. Overall, the project will have positive environmental and social impacts.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IThe primary potential environmental risks canbe grouped into three categories:&#13;
 (i)     Inadvertent human exposure and spread o f the virus due to: improper culling and disposal&#13;
 o f dead birds (wildbirds, sick and dead birds fkom backyard and commercial poultries); lack of,&#13;
 or improper use o f personalprotection equipment (PPE); improper disposal o f farm waste (i.e.,&#13;
 bedding,manure, washings, etc. during and/or after an outbreak); and inadequate laboratory&#13;
 biosafety protocols.&#13;
 (ii)    Inadvertent release o f chemicals inthe environment from unsatisfactory decontamination&#13;
 procedures (for personnel, poultry sheds, and transport vehicles, etc.) and from vaccination&#13;
 manufacturing.&#13;
 (iii)   Release o f chemicals and infectious agents into the environment from inadequate&#13;
 laboratory, medical and vaccination facility waste management.&#13;
&#13;
 22.     The project's investments infacilities, equipment, and training for laboratorieswill&#13;
 improve the effectiveness and safety over existing avian influenza handling and testing&#13;
 procedures by meetinginternational standards established by OIE. Upgrading for laboratories&#13;
 will include provision o f appropriate facilities and training for waste management and for bio-&#13;
 safety level 2 and 3 operations as well as high-containment isolators. Medical waste generated in&#13;
 health care facilities will be managed usingexisting guidelines inRomania, which have been&#13;
 found satisfactory under previous projects. The Project will also support updating these&#13;
 guidelines, training o f health care workers to manage medical waste following these guidelines,&#13;
 and, as appropriate, purchase o f equipment for the proper handling and disposal o f medical waste&#13;
 inparticipating facilities. As such, the project willmainstream environmental safeguards into&#13;
 protocols and procedures for the culling and disposal o f animals during an outbreak, inparticular&#13;
 by adopting OIE standards inthese areas, and improve bio-medical waste management systems&#13;
 inhealth facilities and laboratories.&#13;
&#13;
 23.      Based on the project's planned activities which entail the environmental risks mentioned&#13;
 above, the project has been rated "B" and requires an environmental assessment and&#13;
 environmental management plan. An Environmental Assessment and an Environmental&#13;
 Management Plan are being prepared. The EMP - which will become a part o f the Project&#13;
 ImplementationManual - will describe the methods to be deployed for culling and the disposal&#13;
 o f culled poultry, laboratory and medical facility waste management and bio-safety, and vaccine&#13;
 production and handling.&#13;

 A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE&#13;
&#13;
1. Country and sector issues&#13;
&#13;
1.    Avian Influenza the global dimension. The continuing outbreaks o f highly pathogenic&#13;
                        -&#13;
avian influenza (HPAI), which begun in late 2003 in several Southeast Asian countries and have&#13;
now occurred in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have been disastrous to the poultry&#13;
industryand have raised serious global public health concerns. As o f February 2006, nearly 200&#13;
million domestic poultry had either died or beenculled, and economic losses to the Asian poultry&#13;
sector alone are estimated at around $10 billion. Despite control measures, the disease continues&#13;
to spread, causing further economic losses and threatening the livelihoods o f hundreds o f&#13;
millions o f poor livestock farmers, jeopardizing smallholder entrepreneurship and commercial&#13;
poultry production, and seriously impeding regional and international trade and market&#13;
opportunities. The rural poor, who rely for a larger share o f their income and protein&#13;
consumption on poultry, have been particularly hard hit with income losses and negative&#13;
nutritional consequences. Between February and May, 2006, the first cases o f H5N1 (or H5)&#13;
infections in poultry or wild birds were reported from an unprecedented 34 countries, marking&#13;
the fastest and most extensive geographic spread of H P A I virus since the disease was first&#13;
described in 1978. As o f June 25, 2006, OIE had received official notification o f the presence o f&#13;
AI (H5) from 58 countries inAsia, Europe, Middle East, andAfrica.&#13;
&#13;
2.    So far, worldwide and even in South and Central Asia where many outbreaks have been&#13;
observed, the H5N1 epizootic has only been associated with sporadic human cases. The available&#13;
scientific evidence shows that the H5N1 virus i s not well adapted to humans yet. However,&#13;
genetic accidents (mutation or recombination o f the H5N1 virus with the seasonal influenza&#13;
virus) could trigger a pandemic. As of June 20, 2006 228 people have been infected by the&#13;
disease in 10 countries, namely: Azerbaijan, Cambodia, China, Djibouti, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq,&#13;
Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam. Of the 228 people tested positive to H5N1, 130 died which&#13;
means a fatality rate o f 57%. Before June 2006, no cases o f human to humantransmission had&#13;
been formally confirmed. However, in June 2006 in Indonesia, an outbreak involved eight&#13;
members o f a single family, and seven o f them died. The presence o f the H5N1 virus was&#13;
confirmed in all eight. This i s the largest cluster o f human H5N1 ever reported. While the case is&#13;
under further investigation, evidence is increasing for human-to-human transmission. The nature&#13;
o f the virus and the recent increases in the number o f known cases o f avian influenza (AI)&#13;
transmission have raised concerns over the potential emergence o f a pandemic, which could have&#13;
devastating effects on human health and livelihoods.&#13;
&#13;
3.    It is impossibleto anticipate when the next influenza pandemic may occur or how severe its&#13;
consequences may be. On average, three pandemics per century have been documented since the&#13;
16th century, occurring at intervals of 10-50 years. In the 20th century, pandemics occurred in&#13;
1918, 1957 and 1968. The pandemic o f 1918 is estimated to have killed up to 50 million people&#13;
in eighteen months, with peak mortality rates occurring in people aged 20-45 years. The&#13;
pandemics o f 1957 and 1968 were milder, but many countries nevertheless experienced major&#13;
strains on health care resources. Ifa major pandemic were to appear again, similar to the one in&#13;
1918, even with modern advances in medicine, an unparalleled toll o f illness and death could&#13;
result. Air travel might hasten the spread o f a new virus, and decrease the time available for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
preparing interventions. Country health care systems could be rapidly overwhelmed, economies&#13;
strained, and social order disrupted.&#13;
&#13;
4.   Incollaboration with national and internationalpartners, governments aroundthe world are&#13;
increasing their efforts to prepare and implement contingency plans and action programs inorder&#13;
to increase the general preparedness levels for the prevention and control o f avian influenza and&#13;
a potential human influenza pandemic. The proposedproject will support such efforts undertaken&#13;
by the Government of Romania, inclose collaboration with its international partners.&#13;
&#13;
5.&#13;
World Animal Health Organization) and WHO - have developed and promulgated global&#13;
      International response. The leading international technical agencies - the FAO, OIE (the&#13;
&#13;
strategies, guidelines and norms intendedto minimize the threat and risk o f H P A I inhumans and&#13;
domestic poultry through progressive control and eradication o f HPAI from terrestrial domestic&#13;
poultry. These global strategies are expected to be complemented by and implemented through&#13;
country-specific contingency plans and investment programs for prevention and control. Global&#13;
coordination o f the tracking o f and response to disease outbreaks, as well as the coordination o f&#13;
bilateral and international financial support, has taken form following a series of global meetings&#13;
since October 2005. Within this framework, the UnitedNations and World Bank have supported&#13;
national preparedness planning, resource mobilization efforts, and the design and implementation&#13;
o f national investmentprograms to enhance the countries' prevention and response capacities.&#13;
&#13;
6.    Regional implications. Untilrecently, avian flu outbreaks were limited to Southeast Asia.&#13;
In July 2005, however, first outbreaks were registered in domestic poultry and fowl in seven&#13;
regions of Russia. Four months later, outbreaks o f highly pathogenic H5N1 in poultry were&#13;
reported in four regions o f Kazakhstan. Over the past eleven months, the avian influenza virus&#13;
spread fast across Asia and Europe with its first occurrence in Europe on October 1, 2005, on a&#13;
poultry farm in Turkey, and three days later inRomania on a backyard farm. On January 5,2006,&#13;
the first human cases in Europe were reported from Turkey. As o f June 25, 26 countries&#13;
(Albania, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech&#13;
Republic, Denmark, France, Georgia, Greece, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Kazakhstan, Poland,&#13;
Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom)&#13;
had reported outbreaks o f HPAI (H5) and 9 people had died o f avian influenza in Europe and&#13;
Central Asia. Except for Moldova, Romania i s surrounded by countries in which the avian&#13;
influenza virus has been detected. As o f M a y 31, 2006, AI outbreaks had been reported in&#13;
domestic poultry from Ukraine (22), Turkey (176), and Albania (2) (in parenthesis: number of&#13;
the reported outbreaks) and in wild birds from Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary,&#13;
Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. While no new cases have appeared inRomania since June 6, the&#13;
spread o f the disease continues in neighboring countries. On June 4, another HPAI infection&#13;
(later confirmed as H5N1) was observed in domestic poultry (geese) in Hungary and further&#13;
suspected cases were reported on June 20. On June 11, HPAI was detected (on June 22, 2006,&#13;
confirmed as H5N1) on a poultry farm (chicken, ducks, geese) inthe Sumy region o fUkraine.&#13;
&#13;
7.    Seasonal migration of birds has long been assumed as the major factor in the long-distance&#13;
transmission o f new strains between geographical regions and countries. However, it has become&#13;
increasingly clear that vectors related to the movement of goods and humans through local and&#13;
international trade can be equally responsible for the emergence o f the disease in a new location.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 2 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Outbreaks have therefore prompted bans by the EU (and by other countries) on the import o f&#13;
poultry and poultry products from infected countries. In the case o f Romania, the EU banned&#13;
imports o f live birds, meat and poultry products in 2005 after the confirmation o f H5N1.At the&#13;
end of the first wave, inMay 2006, the EUagreed to limit import restrictions to affected counties&#13;
only. Similar import restrictions for Romanian poultry products were taken by Albania, Bosnia&#13;
and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, and Kosovo. With the&#13;
re-occurrence and rapid spread of the disease in a second wave starting in M a y 2006, the EU&#13;
decided on June 2, 3006, to re-impose the import ban for poultry products from the entire&#13;
Romanian territory.&#13;
&#13;
8.    HPAI outbreak situation in Romania. The H5N1virus was first detected inRomania on&#13;
a backyard farm in the Danube Delta (Tulcea County) on October 4, 2005, and confirmed and&#13;
reported to OIE on October 13, 2005. 52 more outbreaks in nine counties (48 villages and two&#13;
small towns) inthe Danube Delta and Black Sea area, all inbackyard poultry systems, followed&#13;
in this first wave of AI which lasted until April 21, 2006, when the last outbreak location was&#13;
officially declared closed. However, only three weeks later, on M a y 11, 2006 (date of first&#13;
suspicion, with confirmation by virus isolation on M a y 15, 2006), a second avian influenza wave&#13;
started inBrasov country, this time with an outbreak on a commercial farm and at a considerable&#13;
distance from the Danube Delta. On M a y 21, 2006, the presence o f HPAI was confirmed in&#13;
Bucharest, triggering the quarantining o f residential neighborhoods in three sectors o f the city.&#13;
As o f June 9,2006, this second wave had caused 121 confirmed outbreaks (6 more suspected) in&#13;
19 o f Romania's 42 counties, concentrated in but not limited to the center o f the country. After&#13;
the first wave o f AI outbreaks which i s believed to have been caused by wild birds inthe Danube&#13;
Delta region, this second wave revealed that inappropriate farm management and trade practices&#13;
can have equally dramatic effects on the spread o f the disease. Luckily, untiltoday, Romania has&#13;
not experienced any human cases. Of the 17 suspected human cases that have been hospitalized,&#13;
none tested positive. However, in the second wave o f outbreaks alone, about one million birds&#13;
had died or were culled; and the total cost of disease control and economic losses to the poultry&#13;
and related industries is estimated to exceed EUR 90 million. The low level o f bio-security and&#13;
hygieneinbackyardpoultry systems remains a major concern.&#13;
&#13;
9.    Key issues:&#13;
&#13;
    The agriculture sector in the Romanian economy. While Romania i s in a process o f major&#13;
    economic and sectoral transformations resulting ina natural decline of the agricultural sector,&#13;
    agriculture still plays a critical role in the Romanian economy, contributing 11.9% to GDP&#13;
    and harboring 35% o f the total labor force in 2003. About 62% o f Romania's total area i s&#13;
    agricultural (compared to the EU average o f 41%). Gross Agricultural Output has remained&#13;
    roughly constant since 1980: Duringthe first 10 years o f transition, agricultural gross value-&#13;
    added in agriculture declined less than industrial output. But since 2000 the industrial sector&#13;
    has enjoyed continuous growth, while the agricultural sector has experienced significant&#13;
    fluctuations due to its sensitivity to droughts.&#13;
&#13;
    Role of poultry production in Romania's agriculture sector. In 2005, Romanian&#13;
    consumption o f purchased poultry meat increased by 19% compared to the previous year to a&#13;
    total o f around 375,000 tons, o f which 59% or 220,000 tons were produced domestically.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 3 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Compared to the year 2000, domestic production of poultry meat nearly doubled. Including&#13;
production for own consumption, Romania's total domestic output o f poultry is estimated at&#13;
around 360,000 tons. Romania's poultry production is largely based on small-holder&#13;
("backyard") systems inwhich 70% o f the country's poultry population (Le., 70 millionbirds)&#13;
i s kept. A typical small-holder farm in Romania keeps 20 chickens, 10 ducks, 5 turkeys, 3&#13;
geese, 3 swine, 10 sheep and goats, a cow and a horse living inimmediate proximity. Most o f&#13;
the backyard poultry i s producedfor own consumption or for sale at local (live bird) markets.&#13;
Romania's commercial poultry production i s highly concentrated. 15 large producers o f&#13;
poultry meat hold about 60% o f the total commercial production. The two waves o f AI&#13;
outbreaks in Romania have demonstrated the extreme susceptibility o f the sector to both&#13;
disease infections due to low bio-security in backyard farms and market collapse caused by&#13;
loss o f consumer confidence.&#13;
&#13;
On-farm bio-security. Untilthe reoccurrence o f the HPAIinMay 2006, the commercial farm&#13;
bio-security was judged as generally acceptable. Yet, the risk o f thembeing hit by the AI was&#13;
not ruled out for at least two reasons: these farms were located in affected areas and they&#13;
were staffed by workers commuting to and from areas with extensive backyard poultry&#13;
holdings. The new series of outbreaks starting in M a y 2006 raised questions about the&#13;
observance o f bio-security principles even in the large-scale poultry holdings. DRAKOM&#13;
SILVA SRL is likely to have neglected these rules, and there is a possibility that the virus&#13;
was brought by workers from their backyard holdings. Bio-security is particularly weak in&#13;
backyard poultry systems. Most backyard holdings rarely separate different poultry species&#13;
from 'each other or from other animals - notably from pigs which are susceptible to both&#13;
avian and human influenza. Moreover, poultry roam and forage freely during the day and are&#13;
exposed to frequent contact with potentially infected domestic and/or wild birds and their&#13;
excreta&#13;
&#13;
Risk for avian influenza infections and endemism in Romania. Given Romania's&#13;
endowment with waterfowl habitats (Danube Delta, UNESCO world heritage site) coupled&#13;
with the dominance ofbackyard poultrywith low bio-security, future AI outbreaks are likely.&#13;
The natural and farming system environment create a real possibility that the virus could&#13;
become endemic which would further increase the risk o f future outbreaks. Spreading o f the&#13;
H5N1 HPAI among backyard poultry in Romania will significantly affect Romania's&#13;
agriculture and economy in general; it poses a risk o f human infection and also presents a&#13;
danger o f spread o f the infection to poultry inother countries inthe region.&#13;
&#13;
Strengths and weaknesses of the veterinary services.&#13;
     o Institutional framework ANSVSA is Romania's central food safety and animal&#13;
         health authority that acts with functional and decisional autonomy from the Ministry&#13;
         o f Agriculture, reporting directly to the Prime Minister's Office. ANSVSA employs&#13;
         about 3000 regular staff and some 400 area veterinarians in its 42 County Sanitary&#13;
         Veterinary and Food Safety Directorates (Bucharest included). At the local level&#13;
         ANSVSA has contractual arrangements with about 2800 private veterinarians. Three&#13;
         public institutions are affiliated to ANSVSA: (1) the Institute for Diagnosis and&#13;
         Animal Health (IDAH), (2) the Institute for the Control o f Biological Products and&#13;
         Veterinary Drugs, and (3) the Institute for Veterinary Hygiene and Public Health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             - 4 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  (IVHPH). In addition, ANSVSA also controls the border inspection posts (BIPs).&#13;
  During the second wave of AI outbreaks, institutional weaknesses have become&#13;
  evident and the Government has started to restructure the public veterinary&#13;
  institutions. The government intends to establish national and county animal disease&#13;
  control centers.&#13;
o Monitoring, i.e. the continuous investigation of a given population to detect changes&#13;
  in the prevalence of the disease, is currently insufficient. According to an FA0&#13;
  recommendation, monitoring should be expanded beyond the risk areas and needs to&#13;
  cover the entire country.&#13;
o Surveillance. Romania's surveillance system is primarily passive, reacting to reports&#13;
  o f disease suspicions and testing dead or sick birds. Active surveillance would be&#13;
  needed to ensure that the disease i s detected early enough. The AI-related EU&#13;
  Directive [2005/94/EC] requires that a diagnostic manual for the sampling o f&#13;
  commercial farms be used. An active surveillance scheme would substantially&#13;
  increase the number o f samples tested and hence the amount o f testing inputs&#13;
  consumed.&#13;
o Diagnostic    capacity. Romania's      laboratory capacity has been substantially&#13;
  strengthened over the past years and i s equipped to diagnose all notifiable diseases,&#13;
  including HPAI, at the national reference laboratory which i s located at the Institute&#13;
  for Diagnosis and Animal Health (IDAH) affiliated to ANSVSA. The IDAH&#13;
  laboratory i s the only BSL-3 facility on the animal health side, and its capacity for&#13;
  virus isolation is now fully used. During the first wave o f outbreaks, in the period&#13;
  from October 20, 2005, to March 31, 2006, 15,610 samples were processed in the&#13;
  BSL-3-facility o f the national reference laboratory (IDAH). Positive samples from&#13;
  IDAHwere confirmed by the international reference laboratory inWeybridge. IDAH&#13;
  also has robotized equipment for the management o f large numbers o f serological&#13;
  samples. In addition, each county has a local laboratory which has the capacity to&#13;
  perform serological tests with ELISA. Nine of these county laboratories own RT-PCR&#13;
  equipment, four o f which are real-time RT-PCR - all in the south-east o f the country&#13;
  between Bucharest and the Delta. In order to comply with the recommended&#13;
  maximum period o f 24 hours between sampling and PCR results, and given that&#13;
  conventional PCR is too slow for rapid diagnosis in mass outbreaks, ANSVSA&#13;
  intends to equip more county laboratories with real-time RT-PCR, envisaged to be&#13;
  funded by EU's SAPARD program. Giventhe large number o f laboratories across the&#13;
  country and the abundance o f equipment, Romania's veterinary system would benefit&#13;
  from laboratory consolidation and more strategic location. However, moving from&#13;
  passive to active surveillance schemes will substantially increase the number o f&#13;
  samples to be tested for which the capacity not always exists, especially with respect&#13;
  to consumables such as reagents.&#13;
o Epidemiological Surveys. European Council Directive 2005/94/EC (dated December&#13;
  20, 2005) on Community measures for the control o f avian influenza requires EU&#13;
  Member States (MS) to "ensure that epidemiological inquiries are started on the basis&#13;
  o f questionnaires, established within the framework o f the contingency plans&#13;
  provided for in Article 62.'' These inquiries need to include, inter alia, the period o f&#13;
  infection on the premises, possible virus origin, identification o f contact holdings, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     - 5 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      movement o f poultry and poultry products, persons, vehicles and other material. The&#13;
       second wave o f outbreaks in Romania, starting on May 11, 2006, has shown that the&#13;
       lack o f reliable epidemiological information, and the sound analysis thereof, has&#13;
      hampered the development o f rational, targeted disease control measures and slowed&#13;
       down the containment o f the disease.&#13;
   o The Animal disease information system is currently based on emails and paper files;&#13;
       needs to be upgraded to a fully integrated national system which could include the&#13;
      registration o f poultry farms. A data base o f poultry holdings i s not available;&#13;
       however county offices hold registration o f commercial poultry farms. Mayors o f&#13;
       municipalities are obliged to register all backyard flocks within their authority. The&#13;
       current status o f these registers i s not clear.&#13;
   o Outbreak control: culling and disposal of carcasses. Culling is currently performed&#13;
       with plastic garbage containers filled with carbon dioxide. Additional and more&#13;
       appropriate containers for asphyxiation purposes in an animal welfare-acceptable&#13;
       manner are required for the culling operations. The safe disposal o f the carcasses i s&#13;
       not sufficiently solved. At present carcasses are burned in open trenches, and ashes&#13;
       are covered. While open burning o f potentially virus-loaded carcasses is acceptable&#13;
       and in compliance with EU directives if undertaken in response to an emergency, i s&#13;
       negatively affected by wind and precipitation which could create a risk o f virus&#13;
       spreading if carcasses are burned incompletely or too slowly. On the other hand,&#13;
       transportation o f carcasses to other locations for collective burningbears the risk o f&#13;
       contamination in transit. Mobile incineration units would represent an ideal means o f&#13;
       safe disposal o f carcasses ina country with 70% backyard poultry.&#13;
&#13;
Strengths and weaknesses of thepublic health case system.&#13;
   o Institutional framework, planning and coordination. On October 13, 2005, the&#13;
       MinistryofPublic Health adopted anationalplanwhich presents the general strategy&#13;
       for the response to an influenza pandemic o f avian origin and the composition o f the&#13;
       National Committee on Avian Flu. Several other Ordinances complete the national&#13;
       plan by presenting the attributions and responsibilities o f the various Ministries&#13;
       involved inthe response, the methodology for the surveillance and management o f AI&#13;
       human cases and recommendations to the population and travelers. Overall the plan&#13;
       and various orders constitute a good strategic framework and provide good general&#13;
       guidance for action. The plan needs however to be further operationalized. This i s&#13;
       being done with the support o f an USAID Avian flu project which supports the MPH&#13;
       in the preparation and dissemination of technical instructions, guidelines and&#13;
       operational manuals. While the national plan and various orders do present well the&#13;
       infomation flows, the chain o f command i s still insufficiently defined. The roles o f&#13;
       the National Center for Disease and o f the Regional and Country Public Health&#13;
       Departments need to be clarified and individual responsibilities at all levels o f the&#13;
       system shall be defined. Additional work, studies and researches will also be needed&#13;
       especially with regards to the possible kinetics and impact o f a flu pandemic, and&#13;
       means and measures to reduce the spread o f the virus inthe Romanian context.&#13;
   o Epidemiological surveillance and control. In Romania, surveillance o f seasonal&#13;
       influenza has been in place for about 15 years, and the Romania National Influenza&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 6 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        Center is recognized by WHO and i s affiliated with the European Influenza&#13;
        Surveillance System (EISSD). The surveillance system i s deemed to function well.&#13;
        While the M P H Department o f Public Health has the overall responsibility for the&#13;
        prevention o f and fight against avian flu in humans, the 42 existing District Public&#13;
        Health Departments are directly responsible for the investigation o f AI outbreaks. N o&#13;
        major issues have been reported in the past months, and the last W H O K D C mission&#13;
        considered the investigation o f outbreaks satisfactory. However, the increasing&#13;
        number o f AI outbreaks reported in poultry and the risk o f human cases in remote&#13;
        areas o f the country makes it necessary to assess in depth the regional and local&#13;
        capacity to investigate and control outbreaks. Ifneeded, a plan to rapidly build up this&#13;
        capacity should be adopted. The National Influenza Reference laboratory (located at&#13;
        the Cantacuzino Institute) has recently been renovated, is well staffed and fully&#13;
        equipped. However, for safety reasons, in case the virus needs to be isolated, this&#13;
        laboratory should be rapidly upgraded to bio-safety level 3 (from its current bio-&#13;
        safety level 2+ level). The capacity o f regional and district laboratories to perform all&#13;
        major tests to international standards will need to be progressively upgraded.&#13;
    o Health care system response. According to the national plan, at this phase, all&#13;
        suspected cases shall be transported and isolated at the two Bucharest hospitals o f&#13;
        infectious diseases (Prof Matei Bals and Victor Babes Hospital). At this central level&#13;
        the capacity to effectively and safely isolate and treat patients infected with the H5N1&#13;
        virus is relatively good, even if the two infectious disease hospitals need additional&#13;
        equipment for their intensive care units. Would the virus continue to spread or a&#13;
        pandemic occur, patients would need to be hospitalized and treated in a timely and&#13;
        safe manner within or closer to their region o f residence. This requires the&#13;
        establishment of isolation and intensive care units in 7 o f the regional hospitals for&#13;
        infectious diseases. In line with the plan estimate that between 400,000 and 1million&#13;
        antiviral treatments should be stock piled in Romania, 500,000 treatments are&#13;
        currently available. In case of necessity, Romania can access the WHO international&#13;
        stockpile. Romania needs approximately 2.5 million doses o f seasonal flu trivalent&#13;
        vaccines annually. In case o f a pandemic, Romania would need about 5.5 million&#13;
        doses o f a mono-valent vaccine. A significant share o f the national needs could be&#13;
        produced in Romania by the Cantacuzino Institute, which has produced seasonal flu&#13;
        vaccines since 1971. The upgrading o f the existing vaccine production unit at the&#13;
        Cantacuzino Institute would help meet the needs in the pre-pandemic period and&#13;
        would be sufficient incase o f a medium-size pandemic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Compensation scheme. Compensation for poultry culled in affected areas is paid at locally&#13;
determinedmarket prices and generally within less than a week after the culling. This speedy&#13;
payment o f compensation has substantially contributed to the acceptance o f culling activities&#13;
by the rural population. Compensation payments, in general, are subject to the provisions o f&#13;
the national "Compensation for Animal Deceases'' allocation inthe Ministry o f Agriculture&#13;
(MAFRD) budget. Initial budgetary allocations for payments compensating farmers for&#13;
culling/slaughtering in order to preventbight animal diseases (such as avian influenza, swine&#13;
fever, foot and mouth disease, etc.) amounted to about EUR 2.0 million in MAFRD's 2005&#13;
budget and EUR 5.5 million inthe 2006 budget. Since the first outbreak o f HPAIinRomania&#13;
in October 2005, total compensation payments for culled poultry have added up to EUR 3.9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            - 7 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   million out of which EUR 3.2 million were paid in 2006. During the first AI (2005) wave,&#13;
   421,470 birds were culled in 16,166 households, while during the second (2006) wave, the&#13;
   number o f poultry culled went up to 210,470 (in 14,255 households) and to 764,865 (in&#13;
   commercial farms). Average compensation payments amounted to RON20 (EUR 5.7) per&#13;
   each hen culled (hens representing 80% o f the total poultry culled) to about RON60 (EUR&#13;
   17) per each turkey culled. While remaining within the initial budgetary allocations, a further&#13;
   increase in the number o f HPAI outbreaks might require further capitalization of the&#13;
   compensation fund during the mid-year budget rectification. The GOR has, however,&#13;
   signaled that a 2006 capitalization would be covered from own financial resources and that&#13;
   no support under the Project would be sought. Subject to EU accession in January 2007 and&#13;
   prior submission of an application acceptable to the EC, national expenses for&#13;
   preventive/emergency culling events would then be eligible for a 50% E C financial&#13;
   contribution towards the eligible costs o f measures taken.&#13;
&#13;
   Communications issues related to AI. The government put an emphasis on communication&#13;
   with the public, as an integral measure for controlling the outbreak. Overall, there is a&#13;
   satisfactory level o f awareness, which needed some effort to reach the most remote rural&#13;
   areas o f Romania. Nevertheless, it i s difficult to change behaviors that have been established&#13;
   for ages, and the collaboration o f the population remains critical for controlling the spread o f&#13;
   the disease. Initially, people were concerned about the health risks, but as no human cases&#13;
   were reported, the perception o f risk was apparently reduced. This could also be partly&#13;
   attributed to a lack o f explanation regarding the public health measures that were&#13;
   implemented. Public health messages have focused on the protection o f health and the&#13;
   reduction o f the spread of the disease, while the clear understanding o f risks to health&#13;
   remains weak. The need for reporting i s perceived strongly when it deals with chickens, but&#13;
   not as much for health symptoms inpeople. The health messages are conveyed*mainlyafter&#13;
   the animal outbreak has started and i s controlled, and not before. In Romania AI outbreaks,&#13;
   the main challenge i s a decline o f trust in the authorities by the population, and the need to&#13;
   restore it. People have received messages that are not always consistent and clear from&#13;
   different sources, mainly on self-protective behaviors. Coordinated communication can help&#13;
   restore trust as the public would receive consistent information through common messages&#13;
   from different sources.&#13;
&#13;
2. Legal framework, policies, and contingency planning related to HPAI&#13;
&#13;
10. Veterinary activities in Romania are regulated by Government Ordinance No. 42/2004,&#13;
approved by Law no. 215/2004. It comprises general provisions with respect to animal health,&#13;
animal movement, and veterinary certification. It is complemented by a plethora o f specific&#13;
regulations. Romania fully transposed the Council directive 92/40/EC on measures for&#13;
prophylaxis, surveillance, and control o f avian influenza into national legislation. ANSVSA&#13;
Order No. 26/2005 is o f particular interest in the context o f avian influenza as it requires the&#13;
constant monitoring o f all commercial and non-commercial poultry farms, the control o f access&#13;
to poultry farms, compulsory prophylactic quarantine o f poultry before entering it into the&#13;
production chain, and other bio-security andpreventive measures.&#13;

across both the animal and human health sectors. The Plan includes information about the&#13;
disease (etiology, epidemiology, sources of infection, diagnosis, clinical findings, prophylaxis,&#13;
etc.), reference to applicable legal provisions, financial provisions, the chain o f command,&#13;
national compensation system, and public awareness. The Plan was reviewed and endorsed by a&#13;
WHO/CDC assessment mission carried out inFebruary2006. However, there i s a need for more&#13;
effectively integrated animal-human response teams at the local level and detailed instructions&#13;
and guidelines for the management of outbreaks.&#13;
&#13;
12. In case o f an AI outbreak, Romania pursues a policy o f virus eradication through the&#13;
immediate destruction o f poultry within an epidemiological unit around infected farms, the&#13;
establishment o f surveillance zones, epidemiological surveys, the complete disinfection of&#13;
affected areas and the use o f sentinel birds before restocking, following relevant EUregulations.&#13;
Poultry holders whose animals are destroyed inthe course o f fighting an AI outbreak are entitled&#13;
to receive financial compensation within 60 days. Compensation payments are made from the&#13;
budget of the Ministry o f Agriculture and are based on the replacement value equaling the&#13;
market price o f the destroyed animals or by estimating the total losses incurred by the holder.&#13;
The reference date for the assessment of losses i s the date when control activities started.&#13;
&#13;
13. A National Plan o f Intervention in case o f a (human) influenza pandemic was adopted by&#13;
the Ministry o f Public Health on October 13, 2005. Since then several Ministerial Orders have&#13;
been adopted, including a methodology for the surveillance o f cases o f AI inhumans. InJanuary&#13;
2006, the MPH concluded a protocol with the Ministry o f Transportation, Construction, and&#13;
Tourism, the Ministry o f Administration and the Interior, the National Customs Authority and&#13;
the ANSVSA to optimize public health protection through a more effective inter-institutional&#13;
collaboration. It also concluded a protocol with the Ministry o f Education and Research to&#13;
improve the implementation o f the measures related to the prevention o f appearance and&#13;
transmission of AI to humans. Overall the plan and various orders constitute a good strategic&#13;
framework and provide good general guidance for action. They closely follow the WHO&#13;
recommendations, address most o f the issues and broadly present the actions to be taken during&#13;
the 6 phases o f the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. The last section o f the National Plan&#13;
provides estimates o f the costs o f the various planned interventions. Additional work, however,&#13;
i s requiredto make this plan more operational by providing details o f some key interventions and&#13;
measures.&#13;
&#13;
3. Institutionalstructure for HPAI crisis management&#13;
&#13;
14. With some 180 outbreaks o f avian influenza on backyard and commercial poultry farms&#13;
since October 2005, Romania has actually experienced a major AI crisis, putting to test her&#13;
emergency response procedures and institutional capacities. A permanent National Disease&#13;
Command Center (the "Central Anti-Epizootic Command Center") as well as local disease&#13;
command centers have been established through Order No. 146/2005. These centers are activated&#13;
individually and successively in times o f disease outbreaks, and as the disease spreads beyond&#13;
mandate areas. Together with the National Commission for Defense against Disasters, which i s&#13;
responsible for the definition o f the overall policy framework for disaster prevention and&#13;
response, the Anti-Epizootic Command Center manages animal disease control measures and i s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 9 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
responsible for the monitoring o f its implementation. According to Government Decision No.&#13;
1218/2005, the Central Anti-Epizootic Command Center i s headed by the Minister o f&#13;
Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development and includes the head o f ANSVSA as vice-&#13;
president as well as representatives o f nine other ministries.On M a y 24, 2006, the leadership o f&#13;
the Anti-Epizootic Command Center was transferred to the Prime Minister who, on May 26,&#13;
2006, established a National Center for the Coordination o f the Fight against AI, chaired by the&#13;
president o f ANSVSA, comprising representatives o f 6 ministries and technical experts as&#13;
needed, and functioning as an advisory body to the Central Anti-Epizootic Command Center. In&#13;
addition, the Command Center i s assisted by a Crisis Cell which i s established upon suspicion o f&#13;
AI andremains operational untilthe quarantine is liftedand the poultry farms are repopulated.&#13;
&#13;
15. The County Disease Command Centers and their corresponding Crisis Cells are made up o f&#13;
the deputy director o f the County Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety Unit and several AI&#13;
experts, and include a Fixed Command Post (located within the County Sanitary and Veterinary&#13;
Unit), Operational Command Posts (located where the outbreaks occur), and Information Cells&#13;
(located at the County Prefectures). Specific operational structures are then established at the&#13;
local level (the so-called "local expert groups"). They can gather under various configurations&#13;
and with very specific tasks: e.g. team o f epidemiologists, screening team, traceability team,&#13;
stamping-out and evaluation team, training team and information groups. Communication flows&#13;
follow the hierarchy above, circulating both ways, using e-mail, fixed and mobile telephones and&#13;
faxes.&#13;
&#13;
16. A national and international notification system i s inplace. At the national level, in case o f&#13;
suspicion or confirmation o f AI, immediate reporting i s compulsory to the competent veterinary&#13;
authorities (Le. County Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Agency). After local confirmation&#13;
o f the disease, ANSVSA (central office) i s informed. ANSVSA i s the only authorized institution&#13;
to make international notifications o f animal diseases. It sends reports to (1) the sanitary and&#13;
phytosanitary agencies o f the European Commission and to the central veterinary agencies o f the&#13;
Member States, (2) the central office o f the OIE, and (3) the central veterinary agencies o f the&#13;
neighboring countries and, ifneeded, to the central veterinary agencies o f other trade partners.&#13;
&#13;
17. The Ministry o f Public Health i s the key institution in charge o f disease surveillance in&#13;
humans and o f implementing preventive measures. It cooperates with the County Public Health&#13;
Departments, the "Cantacuzino" Institute, the Institute o f Infectious Diseases "Prof. Dr. Matei&#13;
Bals", and other sanitary organizations. The Ministry o f Transport, Construction and Tourism i s&#13;
responsible for setting up disinfection points on roads; and the Ministry o f Education and&#13;
Research participates in information and communication campaigns. InOctober 2005, a National&#13;
Committee and county committees for flu pandemic case intervention were established. The&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture, Forests and Rural Development (MAFRD) is responsible for the&#13;
payment o f compensations to poultry holders.&#13;
&#13;
4. Integratednationalprogramand internationalsupportto fight Avian Influenza&#13;
&#13;
18. Romania has received and continues to have access to substantial donor support inits HPAI&#13;
response activities. EU support through Phare and SAPARD grants predominantly target the&#13;
upgrading o f diagnostic and institutional capacities. After the first confirmed outbreak,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 10-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
immediate support was provided by U SAID, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Germany (through&#13;
FA0 TA). These donors have continued their support. Preparedness and response assessments&#13;
have been carried out by FAO, WHO, and CDC. Appendix lb summarizes current and planned&#13;
activities aimed at upgrading institutional capacities for the prevention and control o f HPAI and&#13;
other zoonoses inRomania.&#13;
&#13;
5. Rationale for Bank involvement&#13;
&#13;
19. The justification for the Bank involvement i s the Global Public Goods aspect o f the HPAI,&#13;
one o f many emerging and re-emerging zoonoses, and its strong link to poverty reduction. HPAI&#13;
control programs require a multi-disciplinary approach to integrate technical, social, economic,&#13;
political, policy, and regulatory issues in addressing a complex problem. The Bank i s well-placed&#13;
to build upon its knowledge o f multi-disciplinary approaches needed in the proposed Project,&#13;
which draws on evidence and lessons learned in the various regions regarding emergency&#13;
preparedness responses and multi-disciplinary approaches. The Bank's experience with multi-&#13;
sectoral emergency response and risk-mitigation projects gives it considerable qualifications in&#13;
bringing together the relevant ministries, government agencies, and the donor community, in&#13;
understanding and addressing the social and economic impact, and in assuring high level&#13;
political coordination.&#13;
&#13;
20. Given the Bank's work with FAO, WHO, OIE, EU, USAID and other partners within&#13;
Romania and at the international level to address both preparedness and outbreaks and to assist&#13;
with institutional assessments, the Bank can assist Romania in leveraging additional resources&#13;
from other international and bilateral agencies. In addition to its financial role, the technical&#13;
assistance provided by the Bank has been important in similar global or regional emergency&#13;
situations such as SARS, Tsunami relief, and HIV/AIDS. The Bank's national and regional&#13;
support will be closely linked with the activities o f FAO, WHO, OIE, and the EU and the&#13;
proposedproject i s fully consistent with, and draws heavily on, the global strategies proposed by&#13;
FA0 andWHO.&#13;
&#13;
21. The Bank is particularly well positioned to work with ANSVSA and MPH, based on its&#13;
previous and current involvement through the Modernizing Agricultural Knowledge and&#13;
Information Systems Project (MAKIS) and the Health Reform Project. As such, M A K I S&#13;
supported areas which are also relevant for the AHIP project, including: building ANSVSA&#13;
capacity in risk assessment, management and communication; establishing a communication&#13;
system between the center, regions and counties; training o f staff in EU requirements for food&#13;
safety standards, inspection, testing, enforcement and communications; modernization and&#13;
accreditation o f national reference laboratories and a few regional laboratories;             and&#13;
establishment o f border inspectionpoints.&#13;
&#13;
22. To date the Bank has supported two investment operations in the health sector. The first&#13;
project, Health Services Rehabilitation (Loan size: US$ 150 million), completed in 1999,&#13;
supported, inter-alia, the upgrade of the vaccines production in the Cantacuzino Institute. This&#13;
almost tripled at that time the domestic production o f the main vaccines used by the MPH in the&#13;
mass immunization programs at reduced unit costs. The second project, Health Sector Reform -&#13;
APL Phase 1 - was completed inJune 2004 (Loan size: US$40 million). It covered the upgrade&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 11-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
o f essential hospital care, improvements in emergency medical services and support for primary&#13;
care in selected counties and the strengthening o f the planning capacity within the MPH and the&#13;
counties. The APL Phase 2 i s currently under implementation with a focus on the rehabilitation&#13;
o f the country's network o f maternities, further improvement o f the emergency services,&#13;
improved access to high quality primary health care services in the poor remote areas, and the&#13;
development o f national health accounts.&#13;
&#13;
6. Country eligibility under GPAI&#13;
&#13;
23. Romania is classified as a "newly infected country" with a recent outbreak o f avian&#13;
influenza among poultry but no human infections. Given the existence in Romania o f an&#13;
appropriate response program with effective detection and control measures in place, Romania&#13;
qualifies for participation in the Bank's GPAI and i s eligible to request assistance through an&#13;
Emergency Recovery Loan. In particular, the Government's commitment and the existence o f&#13;
appropriate structures and mechanisms for the fight against H P A I are evident, inter alia, in the&#13;
establishment o f a National Disease Command Center, chaired by the Prime Minister; the&#13;
existence o f effective control measures demonstrated during the first wave o f outbreaks in&#13;
October 2005 through April 2006; the rapid detection o f the second wave o f outbreaks and&#13;
efforts to detect the source o f infection; and the absence o f human infections to date.&#13;
&#13;
7. Lessons learned and reflected inproject design&#13;
&#13;
24. Relevant lessons for the design o f the proposed operation have been drawn from the&#13;
implementation o f projects inthe agricultural and health sectors inRomania and from the design&#13;
o f previous World Bank and FAO-supported emergency recovery projects. The Vietnam Avian&#13;
Influenza Emergency Recovery Project, approved in August 2004, was the Bank's first avian&#13;
influenza operation. By now, under the GPAI, six more projects have been approved (in&#13;
Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Nigeria, Turkey) and 14 more are under&#13;
preparation (in Afghanistan, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cambodia, Djibouti, Ethiopia,&#13;
Indonesia, Lao PDR, Nepal, Romania, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, West Bank/Gaza).&#13;
&#13;
25. A performance audit o f some o f the emergency projects supported by the Bank in various&#13;
regions drew the following general lessons: (i)emergency projects should avoid policy&#13;
conditionality; (ii)project design must be simple and take into account a realistic assessment o f&#13;
the existing capacity of the Borrower and other stakeholders, e.g. NGOs; (iii) speedy appraisal&#13;
                                                                                   a&#13;
and approval are crucial to provide a prompt response and a substantial contribution to project&#13;
success; (iv) procurement arrangements should be finalized at an early stage but need to remain&#13;
flexible; (v) mitigation and prevention measures should be included in the design to minimize&#13;
impacts o f a possible recurrence o f the disaster; and (vi) realistic assessments should be made o f&#13;
the counterparts' absorptive capacity, as well as o f the effectiveness o f communications and&#13;
coordination mechanisms among all relevant stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
26. The Vietnam Avian Influenza Emergency Recovery Project has been effective since&#13;
November 9, 2004. The main recommendations arising from its implementation are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 12-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   0   Preparedness is a key factor. While Vietnam had a national strategy document to control&#13;
       avian influenza in the domestic poultry population, it was not clearly understood and&#13;
       shared by all relevant stakeholders and some aspects o f the response have lagged.&#13;
&#13;
   0   A two-pronged strategy is recommended, including: (i) control o f HPAIat the source&#13;
                                                                 the&#13;
       in high-risk regions (through aggressive measures including culling and movement&#13;
       control); and (ii) simultaneously prepared short and medium-term measures to minimize&#13;
       the risks to humans and prepare for an eventual pandemic.&#13;
       For implementation arrangements, a coordination structure is needed which i s&#13;
       empowered with multi-sectoral responsibilities, for instance at the Prime Minister's&#13;
       Office level, and to have full time project coordinators to implement activities ina "crisis&#13;
       situation". Coordination should not only involve the Government, but include the donor&#13;
       community, the private sector and the civil society.&#13;
&#13;
   0   A "compensation framework" is essential to obtain cooperation from affected farmers and&#13;
       to ensure the efficacy o f the surveillance and diagnosis mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
   0   Strengthening the technical, scientific and operational capacity o f relevant participating&#13;
       agencies i s important. The HPAI crisis highlighted several weaknesses in the existing&#13;
       animal health and public health services systems, including: poor surveillance at the local&#13;
       level, weak diagnostic capacity, lack o f epidemiological expertise and information&#13;
       system, and inadequate operating budget to bear the additional physical and human cost&#13;
       to contain the disease.&#13;
&#13;
   0   An effective national response is imperative in case o f a human epidemic, including all&#13;
       technical ministries in charge of agriculture/animal health and human health, as well as&#13;
       other relevant sectors, at the national and sub-national level.&#13;
       Raising awareness inthe public and private sectors is important from the initial moments.&#13;
        Support should be given for the integration o f each country to a regional and global&#13;
       framework for the control o f HPAI, and more broadly o f all trans-boundary animal&#13;
       diseases and other emerging infectious diseases, to increase cost-effectiveness and ensure&#13;
       the harmonization o f activities and responses.&#13;
&#13;
 B. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
1. Projectdevelopmentobjectiveandkey indicators&#13;
&#13;
27. The project will support and constitutes an integral part o f a national program to increase&#13;
Romania's avian and human influenza preparedness, i.e. the countryk capacity to prevent and&#13;
control the spread o f influenza among animals and humans. In this context, the overall&#13;
development objective o f the project is to reduce the threat posed to humans and the poultry&#13;
sector in Romania by HPAI and other zoonoses, and to support the preparation for, control of,&#13;
and response to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans. To&#13;
achieve this, the project will support activities inthe three areas o f prevention, preparedness and&#13;
contingency planning, response and containment under the three components: (i)         animal health;&#13;
(ii) health;and(iii) awareness,communicationsandimplementationsupport.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
28.   Key indicators include: (i)evidence o f institutional mechanisms for effective&#13;
implementation o f appropriate disease contingency plans; (ii)evidence o f an effective&#13;
surveillance system for both animals and humans for HPAI and other zoonoses; (iii)       evidence o f&#13;
enhanced outbreak control capacities and general awareness, reducing the probability of virus&#13;
transmission from animals to humans; (iv) evidence o f increased capacities to handle human&#13;
cases o f infectious diseases.&#13;
&#13;
2. Financinginstrumentandprojectcomponents&#13;
&#13;
29. The proposed project has been prepared within the framework o f the Global Program for&#13;
Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response (GPAI), endorsed by&#13;
the Bank's Board o f Executive Directors on January 12, 2006. Under the GPAI - a global,&#13;
horizontal Adaptable Program Loan (APL)- individual countries can obtain separate loans (and&#13;
credits and grants, depending on the specific country case) to finance national programs. The&#13;
GPAI was endorsed with a comprehensive list o f eligible activities and set out the criteria for&#13;
participation in this global program. The Bank's emergency policy and business procedures,&#13;
OP/BP 8.50, apply. In this context the proposed project will be financed as a new and self-&#13;
standing operation through an Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL) o f EUR 29.6 million (US$ 37.7&#13;
million equivalent) on standard IBRD terms. With a government contribution o f EUR 7.9&#13;
million, the total project cost will amount to EUR 37.5 million. The project will be implemented&#13;
over a period o f three years.&#13;
&#13;
COMPONENT 1: ANIMAL HEALTH&#13;

&#13;
A1  - StrengtheningVeterinary      Institutions(EUR 1.14 million)&#13;
&#13;
31. Evaluation of National Veterinary Services. The organizational and functional review o f&#13;
the maingovernmental veterinary services undertakenby experts from EUmembercountries and&#13;
international organizations, and the rapid assessment undertaken by the Bank team, suggest the&#13;
need for an in-depth assessment o f the national veterinary services, followed by appropriate&#13;
reforms as may be warranted. To meet international standards set by the World Organization for&#13;
Animal Health (OIE), the EU requirements, and the recommendations developed by FA0 and&#13;
EU experts, the veterinary services need to develop and document appropriate procedures and&#13;
standards for the implementation and management of animal health measures and international&#13;
veterinary certification activities. As a basis for activities in support o f institutional&#13;
enhancements (below), the project will provide technical assistance to support the self-evaluation&#13;
o f and by the national veterinary services based on OIE's "Performance, Vision and Strategy for&#13;
Veterinary Services'' evaluation guidelines in order to establish the current level o f performance,&#13;
form a shared vision with service providers and clients in the private sector, establish priorities,&#13;
and facilitate strategic planning.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
32. Strengthening Veterinary and Food Safety Institutions. Once the evaluation o f veterinary&#13;
and related services (above) has been completed, the project will provide technical support for&#13;
realigning institutional structures and resources with priority objectives, mandates, and tasks. In&#13;
collaboration with and complementary to ongoing and planned advisory activities funded by&#13;
donors and international organizations, the project will provide technical assistance for&#13;
institutional and organizational restructuring at national and county levels as may be warranted;&#13;
training o f staff; equipment and materials. In particular, the project will support the&#13;
establishment o f animal disease control centers at the national and county levels.&#13;

    -&#13;
&#13;
33. Contingency Plan Implementation Guidelines and Manuals. While governmental&#13;
authorities have developed individual contingency plans for animal and human health, overall&#13;
national contingency planning and coordination still needs improvements. The Government has&#13;
established a National Disease (AI) Control Center that has started a comprehensive process o f&#13;
reviewing, integrating, and consolidating existing contingency plans. The project will provide&#13;
technical assistance to support this process o f refining and finalizing the draft contingency&#13;
plan(s) and to develop the necessary detailed implementation guidelines and manuals for relevant&#13;
agencies and services.&#13;

&#13;
B1 StrengtheningMonitoringandSurveillanceSystems (EUR 0.18 million)&#13;
    -&#13;
&#13;
34. Surveillance Capacity of Veterinary Services. The project will provide technical assistance&#13;
and training for staff o f veterinary service institutions at national and local levels, focusing on the&#13;
structured routine collection o f samples on a national scale, on intensive follow-up sampling&#13;
around outbreaks areas, as well as routine investigation o f dead wild birds that are regularly&#13;
collected for such purposes (support for serological testing under active surveillance schemes i s&#13;
provided under the diagnostic capacity component B2 and support to local mobility i s provided&#13;
under the institutional strengthening component A1).&#13;
&#13;
35. Epidemiological Surveys. The second wave o f HPAI outbreaks in Romania, starting on&#13;
M a y 11, 2006, has shown that the lack o f reliable epidemiological information, and the sound&#13;
analysis thereof, has hampered the development o f rational, targeted disease control measures&#13;
and slowed down the containment o f the disease. The project will provide technical assistance&#13;
and training for epidemiological studies and surveillance programs to support decision makers in&#13;
continuously fine-tuning and improving disease control measures based on improved risk&#13;
assessment. InRomania where 70% o f poultry i s produced inbackyard systems, small-scale and&#13;
semi-commercial poultry production systems are the major control target.&#13;
&#13;
B2 StrengtheningDiagnosticCapacity (EUR 8.14 million)&#13;

&#13;
36. Diagnostic capacity in Romania's national reference laboratory (IDAH) and county&#13;
laboratories. In order to equip existing laboratories for the increased work load under active&#13;
surveillance schemes and to minimize the length o f the period between infection and control&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
action (Le. the highrisk period being the time needed for detection, reporting, sampling, testing,&#13;
and decision-making for response), the project will finance priority laboratory equipment and&#13;
laboratory consumables including sampling kits, materials for transporting and conditioning o f&#13;
samples, reagents, as well as technical assistance and training, in order to increase the capacity&#13;
for virology and serological tests, screening surveys for the confirmation o f the disease and the&#13;
preparation for the differentiation o f AI sub-types. The sub-component will also provide personal&#13;
protective and laboratory waste disposal equipment. Twinning arrangements with appropriate&#13;
institutions outside Romania will be explored in order to facilitate sustained capacity&#13;
strengthening.&#13;
&#13;
37. Quality control of veterinary medicinal products. This sub-component will provide&#13;
equipment, consumables, technical assistance and training for increasing the capacity o f the&#13;
Institute for Control o f Biological Products and Veterinary Drugs to fulfill its responsibility in&#13;
providing quality control for vaccines and other veterinary medicinal products for which formal&#13;
quality assurance has to beprovided by the State.&#13;
&#13;
B3 StrengtheningAnimalDiseases InformationSystems (EUR 2.23 million)&#13;
    -&#13;
&#13;
38. This sub-component will support the development o f a comprehensive integrated national&#13;
animal disease information system which will enable Romania to participate in global disease&#13;
information sharing and comply with its obligations as a member o f OIE, contributing towards&#13;
progressively better global and regional control and eradication. The system will be linked with&#13;
rapid and standardized methods o f routine analysis o f surveillance data in order to track&#13;
important changes inthe H5N1 situation and promptly supply this information to field personnel.&#13;
The system supported under the project is intendedto enable an effective and efficient flow o f&#13;
information among relevant agencies and individuals (esp. field veterinarians, laboratory experts,&#13;
epidemiologists, etc.), providing the necessary support to decision-makers charged with the&#13;
prevention and control o f animal diseases at local and national levels. The project will provide&#13;
technical assistance, priority equipment and supplies, and training, for the design, establishment&#13;
and use o f the system. The animal health information system also includes a geo-referenced&#13;
database for all poultry farms, conforming to the requirement o f municipalities to register all&#13;

&#13;
39. Applied Veterirzary Research Program. A Government Decision under preparation at the&#13;
time o f project appraisal i s to provide ANSVSA in the near future with a new mandate on&#13;
establishing the Research Center for Cross border Diseases, Emergencies, Reemergence and&#13;
Zoonoses o f the Institute for Diagnosis and Animal Health, situated on premises at Tulcea. This&#13;
sub-component will be limited to the provision o f preparatory support to initiate applied research&#13;
on epidemiology, bird migration and ecology, and other subjects related to HPAI (and other&#13;
zoonotic diseases) by providing technical assistance for ANSVSA to assist with the design a&#13;
research program as well as to assist with the design, construction and refurbishment plans for&#13;
the physical facilities for the Research Center. Twinning arrangements with appropriate&#13;
institutions outside Romania will be explored in order to facilitate sustained capacity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 16-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
strengthening. Upon completion of the design additional project funds may be made available&#13;
subject to a separate request and subsequent appraisal.&#13;
&#13;
40. Infectious disease research on live animals. Research with highly infectious agents (such&#13;
as HPAIvirus) on live animals - as may be required for the testing o f vaccines and the practicing&#13;
o f vaccination and post-vaccination sampling - requires a high-containment laboratory&#13;
environment. The project will finance goods, consumables, and civil works for minor&#13;
refurbishments inexisting laboratory facilities for the installation andoperation o f isolators at the&#13;
Institute for Control o f BiologicalProducts and Veterinary Drugs.&#13;
&#13;
(C)StrengtheningHPAI ControlPrograms&#13;
&#13;
C1  - TargetingVirus     Eradication at the Source(EUR 1.47 million)&#13;
&#13;
41. Quarantine, Culling and Disposal. Although capable teams are in place to effectively&#13;
control HPAI outbreaks, the recent wave o f out outbreaks has overwhelmed authorities and&#13;
veterinary services. The wide distribution o f small flocks across a country where 70% o f poultry&#13;
are produced in backyard systems i s a particular challenge for the control o f the disease. The&#13;
project will contribute to the enhancement o f existing capacities for the control o f HPAI&#13;
outbreaks as requiredby existing national contingency plans. Weaknesses have beenidentified in&#13;
the areas o f quarantining (disinfection stations), culling o f infected and at-risk poultry, and the&#13;
safe disposal o f poultry carcasses and potentially infectious materials in a bio-secure and&#13;
environmentally acceptable manner. Disinfection practices will be improved with support from&#13;
other than project sources. The project will focus its assistance on the culling of poultry and on&#13;
the disposal o f carcasses in small-holder systems - which dominate Romania's poultry sector.&#13;
The project will finance the purchase and operation o f containers where C 0 2 is applied in an&#13;
animal welfare acceptable manner. The project will also finance the purchase and operation o f&#13;
mobile incinerators with a combined daily capacity o f about 40,000 kg.&#13;
&#13;
C2 SupportingPoultryVaccinationCampaigns (EUR 0.10 million)&#13;
    -&#13;
&#13;
42.   Vaccination planning and implementation. A policy on the use o f vaccination for the&#13;
containment o f H P A I outbreaks has not yet been formulated. In situations where other measures&#13;
failed to control the spread o f the disease and where the virus has become endemic, vaccination&#13;
might in future become an option for the containment o f the disease. The project will therefore&#13;
provide technical assistance and training to develop Romania's vaccination policy, contingency&#13;
plan and implementation manuals in the context o f its near-future EU membership, and train&#13;
officials, as a contingency planning exercise, in the implementation o f poultry vaccination&#13;
campaigns and post-vaccination monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
(D)ImprovingBio-securityinpoultryproductionandtrade (EUR 0.29 million)&#13;
&#13;
43. Bio-security on small-scale poultry farms. The level o f bio-security both on commercial&#13;
and on backyard farms i s insufficient and represents a major risk for new waves o f infections.&#13;
The project will support enhancements o f bio-security on small-holder farms with the following&#13;
instruments:(i)  Bio-security on poultry farms is - primarily - the result o f managerial decisions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 1.1-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and behavior (such as restricted access to poultry production farms, quarantining o f new&#13;
purchases, separation o f sick animals, separation o f species, personal hygiene, etc). The project&#13;
will therefore support awareness campaims and knowledge transfer activities - including on-&#13;
farm demonstrations and training o f farmers, extension agents, and other rural services providers&#13;
- aimed at managerial and behavioral changes. (ii) project will also finance technical&#13;
                                                          The&#13;
assistance for a comprehensive poultry sector assessment which - together with improved&#13;
epidemiological evidence - will help shape state support to increased bio-security on small-&#13;
holder farms. This study will assess the structure o f the poultry production sector, assess bio-&#13;
security issues indifferent production systems, and formulate technical options for upgrading on-&#13;
farm bio-security, especially in small-holdings. It will result in the publication o f biosecurity&#13;
manuals for different stakeholders (iii)  Investment incentives (on a matching grant basis) for&#13;
infrastructure upgrades on small-holder farms in compliance with enhanced bio-security&#13;
requirements (such as fencing, compartmentalization, caging, and manure disposal.), based on&#13;
the results o f the poultry sector assessment and successful pilot activities, could be an option for&#13;
project follow-up activities and were endorsed by the appraisal mission but have not been&#13;
included inthe final project design.&#13;
&#13;
COMPONENT 2: HUMANHEALTH&#13;
&#13;
44. The Human Health Component will comprise three subcomponents for a total estimated&#13;
cost o f EUR 19.80 million, with Bank financing inthe amount o f EUR 16.95 million.&#13;
&#13;
(A)EnhancingPublicHealthProgramPlanningand Coordination(EUR 0.16 million)&#13;
&#13;
45. Activities under the first subcomponent will aim at enhancing coordination and program&#13;
planning by providing financial and technical support for additional studies and research as well&#13;
as for conferences and workshops, including the organization o f a regional coordination meeting&#13;
on preparations for a human influenza pandemic.&#13;
&#13;
(B)Strengtheningof NationalPublicHealthSurveillanceSystems (EUR 1.26 million)&#13;
&#13;
46. The second subcomponent will help strengthen the national public surveillance system by:&#13;
(i)Upgrading o f the National Influenza Laboratory to B S L 3 through the financing o f minor civil&#13;
works (partitioning and creation o f decontamination rooms), the supply and installation o f&#13;
additional security devices, and the installation o f a system for maintaining negative pressure in&#13;
the rooms; and (ii)   Strengthening o f regional laboratories by providing critical equipment and&#13;
training o f staff.&#13;
&#13;
(C)StrengtheningHealthSystemResponse Capacity (EUR 18.29 million)&#13;
&#13;
47. The third subcomponent will help strengthen the capacity o f the health care system to&#13;
respondto the disease, through:&#13;
&#13;
     (i)The      strengthening of the isolation and case management capacity in both national&#13;
          and regional hospitals. The project will finance equipment for the intensive care units&#13;
          o f the two Bucharest infectious diseases hospitals and the establishment o f isolation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 18 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
          and intensive care units in the 7 regional centers for infectious diseases (Brasov,&#13;
          Craiova, Constanta, Cluj, Iasi, Timisoara and Tg. Mures). According to the National&#13;
          Plan, during the inter-pandemic period, all suspected cases shall be transported to and&#13;
          isolated at the Institute o f Infectious Diseases Prof Dr Matei Bals, where medical&#13;
          assistance can be provided by specialized dedicated personnel. The centralization o f&#13;
          patient care i s the only possible way at this point in time as there i s no medical unit&#13;
          able to ensure high quality care to suspected or confirmed AI human cases in the rest&#13;
          o f the country. However, in the future, patients would have to be hospitalized within&#13;
          their region o f residence. Therefore, there is a need to develop isolation and intensive&#13;
          care capacities inthe regional centers for infectious diseases.&#13;
&#13;
     (ii)Theupgradingof theinfluenza vaccineproduction unitattheCantacuzinoInstitute&#13;
          including the rehabilitation and equipment o f the influenza production department, and&#13;
          the completion and equipment o f the filling and sealing unit. A significant part o f the&#13;
          vaccines needed in Romania during the inter-pandemic and pandemic periods can be&#13;
          produced by the Cantacuzino Institute. Making the Institute able to significantly&#13;
          increase up to 2.5 million doses and its production in full compliance with GMP&#13;
          standards requires the upgrading o f both the production unit and the filling and sealing&#13;
          station. This intervention will help both to increase the production capacity and to&#13;
          ensure that the production i s at the required Good Manufacturing Practice standards.&#13;
&#13;
COMPONENT 3: PUBLIC AWARENESS, COMMUNICATION, AND&#13;
                      IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT&#13;
&#13;
(A)PublicAwareness and Communications(EUR 1.64 million)&#13;
&#13;
48. The Public Awareness and Communication sub-component will support the GOR's efforts&#13;
in designing and implementing an integrated and comprehensive communications strategy and&#13;
action plan. The component will be implemented by ANSVSA, and will comprise the following&#13;
three sub-components:&#13;
&#13;
      (i)for&#13;
           Strengthening institutional capacity for ANSVSA: the project will support assistance&#13;
                and training o f communications staff, and additional equipment and operating&#13;
           costs for the communications team inthe ANSVSA.&#13;
&#13;
      (ii)Development of an integrated communications strategy and action plan for both&#13;
           human and animal health based on qualitative and quantitative research: the project&#13;
           will build on the experience gained from the information campaigns o f UNDP,&#13;
           UNICEF, USAID, as well as on the sectoral communications strategies o f WHO and&#13;
           UNICEF, and the communications needs assessment o f ANSVSA. The strategy will&#13;
           define parameters of specific audiences invarious generic target groups, the degree o f&#13;
           social acceptance o f proposed hygiene and bio-security measures, the associated&#13;
           messages which will need to be persuasive without creating panic, and the most&#13;
           efficient delivery tools and vehicles for a nation wide campaign.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 19-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      (iii)Delivery of several information campaigns: these will aim to obtain the public's&#13;
           support and participation inreporting and monitoring; to promote and induce a set o f&#13;
           behavior changes which will diminish the possibility o f AI outbreaks and&#13;
           contamination; and to educate different key audiences (farmers, people living in&#13;
           villages, traders, local authorities, media, food inspectors, front line workers,&#13;
           consumers, other stakeholders). The campaigns, even iftargeted especially for HPAI,&#13;
           will leadto other important positive externalities. The proposedbio-security measures&#13;
           and associated campaigns will also affect the spreading and prevention o f other&#13;
           animal diseases such as Newcastle disease, Classical swine fever, or Rabies, and will&#13;
           provide support for other on-going ANSVSA programs such as animal welfare,&#13;
           identification and registration o f animals and traceability. Also, the campaigns will&#13;
           improve the general hygiene and sanitation o f the population. In close collaboration&#13;
           with and complementary to the animal health related and overall coordination&#13;
           activities supported under the project, human health related communications activities&#13;
           will be entirely financed through USAID support and from governmental budgets&#13;
           under MPH.&#13;
&#13;
(B)ImplementationSupport,MonitoringandEvaluation(EUR 1.82 million)&#13;
&#13;
49. The project will be implemented by the MPH and ANSVSA, building upon their experience&#13;
with implementing other bank financed projects. In order to ensure effective implementation o f&#13;
the project in accordance with Bank fiduciary and procurement policies and guidelines, the&#13;
project will finance: (i)Incremental support in terms o f staff and operating costs to the existing&#13;
project management unit within M P H and the project management unit to be established within&#13;
ANSVSA; (ii)Studies, technical services, manuals; and (iii)Surveys for monitoring and&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
3. Projectcosts andfinancing&#13;
&#13;
50. Total project costs have been estimated at EUR 37.50 million o f which the IBRD loan will&#13;
finance EUR 29.60 million. In addition, the Borrower expressed its commitment to finance&#13;
project related rehabilitation, maintenance and operating costs for the entire duration o f the&#13;
Project.&#13;
&#13;
51.   Governmental A I Program and donor support (parallel financing). Based on the&#13;
Government's "Strategy for improvement o f infrastructure o f veterinary control and control o f&#13;
food in the public sector", Romania requested under SAPARD Measure 1.2 on "Improving the&#13;
structures for quality, veterinary and plant health controls, for the quality o f foodstuffs and for&#13;
consumer protection", EU financing for upgrading 16 county laboratories in all o f Romania's&#13;
eight regions. In addition, EU's PHAFG project has allocated EUR 500,000 for consumables to&#13;
upgrade diagnostic capacity at the regional and national levels, as well as culling and disposal&#13;
equipment and disinfection points ("filters") on roads. Romania is also coordinating with the EU&#13;
with regard to HPAI contingency planning and epidemiology. International partners reacted&#13;
promptly to Romania's emergency AI situation, and several donor meetings were held for&#13;
coordination and knowledge sharing. Based on technical and scientific support o f WHO and&#13;
FAO, technical assistance, training and limited equipment were provided by USAID, the&#13;
&#13;

integration into a national framework for the enhancement of HPAI preparedness (prevention&#13;
and control capacity) is provided inAppendix lb&#13;
&#13;
52. Financing gapsfor which Bankflnancing is sought. The GOR has requestedWorld Bank&#13;
assistance for an emergency operation to fill specific gaps in some areas that are not being&#13;
fundedby state budgets, the EUor other donors. These are summarized inthe table below. More&#13;

 C. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
1. Overallprojectcoordinationand management&#13;
&#13;
53. The Government o f Romania has set up emergency response structures at the national and&#13;
local levels for the management o f HPAI control. The Anti-Epizootic Command Center at the&#13;
national level and the animal disease command centers at the county and municipality levels&#13;
form the backbone o f the HPAI emergency institutional structure, activated in times o f disease&#13;
outbreak. Together with the National Commission for Defense against Disasters, which i s&#13;
responsible for the definition o f the overall policy framework for disaster prevention and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               -21 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
response, the Anti-Epizootic Command Center manages animal disease control measures and is&#13;
responsible for the monitoring o f its implementation. The command centers are staffed with&#13;
veterinary specialists from ANSVSA and its County Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Units&#13;
and supplemented by officials from other ministries. On M a y 24, 2006, the leadership o f the&#13;
Anti-Epizootic Command Center - which includes representatives from ANSVSA and 10&#13;
ministries (Agriculture, Forests and Rural Development; European Integration; Public Finance;&#13;
Administration and Interior; National Defense; Foreign Affairs; Public Health; Transport,&#13;
Construction and Tourism; Communications and Information Technology; Environment and&#13;
Water Management) - was transferred from the Minister o f Agriculture to the Prime Minister.&#13;
&#13;
54. Inline with this overall HPAIemergency structure, the project will be coordinatedby a task&#13;
force within the National Anti-Epizootic Command Center. This task force - operating as the&#13;
Project Steering Committee (PSC) - will consist o f representatives o f the Prime Minister's Office&#13;
as the Chair, the MOPF, ANSVSA, and MPH. Given that the task force will consist o f members&#13;
(or their delegates) o f the Anti-Epizootic Command Center, project activities will be fully&#13;
integrated into the overall strategy and national action program to control HPAI. The PSC will&#13;
coordinate and collaborate with other ministries (many o f which are represented in the Anti-&#13;
Epizootic Command Center) affiliated institutions, as well as donors and other international&#13;
partners as needed. While the Anti-Epizootic Command Center is only activated in crisis&#13;
situations, the PSC will meet more regularly. The PSC is responsible for the provision o f broad&#13;
guidance in project implementation and for ensuring that project activities conform to national&#13;
emergency response strategies and policies. The PSC will review work programs including&#13;
budget and procurement plans, and review and evaluate technical and financial monitoring&#13;
reports. Special attention will be paid to the coordination o f the communications activities&#13;
undertaken by MPH and ANSVSA with participation and inputs from the two Project&#13;
Coordinators (definition below). The PSC will report to the Prime Minister on a regular basis&#13;
about progress and impact o fproject implementation.&#13;
&#13;
2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements&#13;
&#13;
55. The project will be implemented jointly by the National Sanitary, Veterinary and Food&#13;
Safety Authority (ANSVSA) and Ministry o f Public Health (MPH). Both implementing agencies&#13;
have designated senior officials as Component Coordinators who have guided project&#13;
preparation and who will be responsible for the implementation o f their respective components.&#13;
Inboth implementing agencies, Project Management Units (PMUs) will be responsible for the&#13;
day-to-day management o f the avian influenza project. However, the P M U at ANSVSA will&#13;
need to receive official status, which i s a condition o f effectiveness. While staff experienced in&#13;
the implementation o f Bank-financed projects exists inthese PMUs, additional human resources&#13;
and limited equipment and recurrent cost will be covered under the avian influenza project to&#13;
enable them to cope with the additional work load.&#13;
&#13;
56. The Animal Health Component will be implemented by ANSVSA through a P M U to be&#13;
established before effectiveness. This new ANSVSA PMU will be strengthened with additional&#13;
staff (financial, procurement, technical experts) and given access to resources for additional&#13;
operating expenditures related to activities o f the avian influenza project. Overall coordination o f&#13;
the component will be assured by a senior veterinary official.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 22 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57. The Human Health Component will be implemented by MPH, through the PMU&#13;
established for the second phase o f the Health Sector Reform Project. The PMU i s well-&#13;
experienced in assuring that procurement and financial management i s carried out in accordance&#13;
with World Bank guidelines, however limited support for incremental staff and operating costs&#13;
will be provided. The activities o fthe P M Uunder this component will be under direct oversight&#13;
o f the component coordinator who i s the head o f the HSR Project. The beneficiary institutions&#13;
(Cantacuzino Institute, infectious disease hospitals) will play a leading role in the technical&#13;
design and bid evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
58. The Public Awareness and Communications Component will be implemented by&#13;
ANSVSA. Inparticular, there will be a joint communications strategy and action plan, and the&#13;
information campaigns will be coordinated in terms o f timing, design, messages, distribution&#13;
channels and targeted audiences. Details of the institutional arrangements, coordination&#13;
mechanisms, and decision-making processes, as well as monitoring and evaluation, will be&#13;
described by the Borrower in a Project Implementation Manual (PIM) satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
The PIM will include a description o f these structures and processes, as well as the procurement&#13;
plans, detailed cost tables, environmental management plan (EMP), forms for budgeting and&#13;
financial reporting, monitoring methodology and forms, terms o f reference for key positions o f&#13;
project management and technical assistance, and annotated outlines o f envisaged training&#13;
activities.&#13;

&#13;
59. Procurement. Procurement for the Animal Health Component will be carried out by&#13;
ANSVSA through a Project Management Unit (PMU) to be established before effectiveness, and&#13;
for the Human Health Component by MPH through the PMU for the Health APL 2 Project. The&#13;
Public Awareness and Communications Component will be implemented by ANSVSA. The&#13;
Bank has carried out procurement capacity assessments o f the two implementingagencies which&#13;
will be responsible for fiduciary tasks including procurement, financial management, and&#13;
disbursementsandhas found them to be acceptable. Additional procurement staffwill be hired to&#13;
support the additional work for both PMUs related to the implementation o f this project. Further&#13;
details on procurement arrangements are provided inAnnex 6.&#13;
&#13;
60. FinancialManagement.Strengths and Weaknesses: The significant strengths that provide&#13;
a basis o f reliance on the project financial management system include the simple funds' flow&#13;
and project financial management teams experienced in the implementation o f other WB&#13;
financed projects. There are no significant weaknesses o f the project financial management&#13;
system. Implementing Entities: The existing project management unit within the Ministry o f&#13;
Public Health (MPH) in charge o f the implementation o f the Health APL 2 Project (P078971)&#13;
and the project management unit to be established within ANSVSA, will be responsible for the&#13;
financial management o f the Project.&#13;
&#13;
4. Monitoringand evaluation of outcomesh-esults&#13;
&#13;
61. Monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) activities related to the project will be the responsibility&#13;
o f both the ANSVSA andMPH. Depending on the specific situation ineach case, these activities&#13;

could be carried out by the regular staff o f the agencies (with the support o f the respective&#13;
implementation units) or by contracting out these functions with specialized agencieshnstitutes&#13;
when appropriate. Monitoring project progress and the achievement o f objectives will entail&#13;
continuous and systematic review o f the various project implementation activities. The purpose&#13;
o f the M&amp;E activities are to: (i)&#13;
                                 measure input, output and outcome indicators (see Appendix 2);&#13;
(ii) informationregularlyonprogresstowardachievingresultsandfacilitatingreporting&#13;
     provide&#13;

potential problems in implementation so that adjustments can be made; (iv) determine whether&#13;
the relevant stakeholders are responding as expected and intendedby the project; and (v) provide&#13;
a process whereby the coordinating and executing agencies can reflect and improve on their&#13;
performance. The results o f relevant M&amp;E activities will be reflected in the quarterly project&#13;
reports. These reports will cover the progress with the works, the institutional activities, training&#13;
and studies, performance indicators, and financial reports. Part o f the progress reports will be&#13;
devoted to issues identified during project implementation and the strategies and actions to be&#13;
taken to resolve such issues that affect progress. The individual ANSVSA and MPH reports will&#13;
be aggregated and consolidated at the level o f MPH, who will submit single joint project&#13;
progress reports to the government and to the Bank. Methodological details for monitoring o f&#13;
project progress and impact evaluation will be described inthe Project ImplementationManual.&#13;
&#13;
5. Sustainability, critical risks and possible controversial aspects&#13;
&#13;
62. Romania has demonstrated full commitment in fighting AI and has shown good practice&#13;
and efficiency in containing the disease and closing all outbreaks during both the first and the&#13;
second AI wave. The level of transparency was also outstanding, and the information to the&#13;
public was beneficial in avoiding any human case transmissions to date. The national level&#13;
institutional structures and command lines are established and Romania is now planning for&#13;
improved preparedness and response capacity. Given that Romania's geographic location, natural&#13;
environment and trade relationships make the country vulnerable to further AI outbreaks,&#13;
Romania cannot afford slow implementation o fmeasures designed to enhance the country's level&#13;
o f preparedness. Slow project implementation constitutes a major risk for achieving maximum&#13;
impact. The project will therefore work with existing and proven institutional structures, keep the&#13;
number o f additional entities (committees) to the bare minimum, seek ownership and&#13;
commitment at the highest political level while keeping the decision-making authority at the&#13;
lowest appropriate level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
63. In line with the EC's recent Comprehensive Monitoring Report, dated October 25, 2005,&#13;
which reveals that corruption in Romania remains a serious and widespread problem, the&#13;
corruption risk for this project i s considered significant and relates to procurement, also&#13;
considering the emergency nature o f the operation, and to the safeguarding o f the project assets.&#13;
The project will address the governance and implementation challenges they pose ina systematic&#13;
manner, actively promoting greater transparency, accountability and integrity through smart&#13;
project design and implementation arrangements. These mitigation actions can be summarized as&#13;
follows: (a) the project will establish a tight internal control framework, including appropriate&#13;
internal control over the management and safeguarding o f project assets, in particular the high&#13;
value goods, equipment and vaccines (see appendix 7); (b) the size o f procurement packages and&#13;
the frequency o f the Bank's prior review will be determinedina way that it allows an appropriate&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
level o f control while attempting to avoid unnecessary reviews which could cause delays; (c) the&#13;
project will increase its reliance on internal audit departments as these continue to develop, (d)&#13;
the project will also seek operational reviews by the Court of Accounts or independent auditors&#13;
on terms acceptable to the Bank; (e) enhanced disclosure and transparency o f project-related&#13;
information, including through a project website; and (f) an appropriate complaints handling&#13;
mechanism. All complaints from bidders, observers or other parties should b e promptly&#13;
forwarded to the Government and the Bank for consideration and follow-up action.&#13;

64. Given the scope o f the second wave o f past AI outbreaks and the need to finance&#13;
immediately critical prevention and control activities for likely future outbreaks, Retroactive&#13;
Financing o f up to an amount o f EUR 7.0 million can be provided for eligible expenditures&#13;
incurred between October 7, 2005 and the date o f signing o f the Loan Agreement. Eligible&#13;
expenditures include technical assistance for the strengthening o f veterinary institutions and&#13;
contingency planning, equipment and consumables to enhance national and county laboratory&#13;
capacity, goods and consumables for the safe culling and disposal o f poultry carcasses and the&#13;
disinfection o f outbreak locations, and technical assistance for awareness campaigns and&#13;

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
1. Economicandfinancialanalyses&#13;
&#13;
70. Fiscal and EconomicImpactAnalysis of Past Outbreaks. Since October 2005, Romania&#13;
experienced some 180 HPAI outbreaks in commercial and backyard poultry farms, requiring&#13;
massive control activities including culling, disinfection, quarantining, and compensation, as&#13;
well as preventive medication with anti-viral drugs. Between October 2005 and May 2006, the&#13;
GORincurredthe following expenditures (totaling about EUR 56.3 million):&#13;
&#13;
            Outbreak operations (disinfection, culling, incineration o f poultry etc.): EUR5.7&#13;
            million;&#13;
            Compensations to poultry holders: EUR 3.9 million;&#13;
            Vaccination o f civil population and security forces: EUR 1.O million;&#13;
            Preventive medicationwith anti-viral drugs (Tamiflu): EUR 0.2 million;&#13;
            Sanitary and protection equipment, information materials related to human health:&#13;
            EUR0.3 million.&#13;
            Road and railway disinfection: EUR45.2 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 27 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
71. However, the figures reported by the various public bodies do not cover entirely the public&#13;
financial effort required to fight AI. For instance, the cost o f the AI dedicated classes targeting&#13;
school children was not reported by the Ministry o f Education and Research on the grounds that&#13;
these classes were included into the regular civic education schedule. The Ministry o f&#13;
Administration and Interior reported only costs related to the protection o f the security forces&#13;
that entered the outbreak areas, without counting separately related staff expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
72. In addition, several sectors suffered economic losses: The poultry sector suffered losses&#13;
amounting to around EUR 70 million from depressed prices (down by 41%), drop in demand&#13;
(down by 22%), extra-storage costs (up by 18%), lost export opportunities (down by 14%),&#13;
extra-disinfection costs (up by 14%), and delays in the production flows (down by 1%). The&#13;
Federation o f the Employers in the Romanian Tourism estimates that the sectoral losses caused&#13;
bythe AI go up to around EUR 50 million inthe period from October 2005 to March 2006 alone.&#13;
The actual loss to the economy can be assumed to be much higher. In addition, poultry holders&#13;
sufferedlosses from lost production during an average period o f 6 weeks after infection, culling,&#13;
and disinfection. These losses have been estimated at about EUR 1.5 million since October 2005.&#13;
Up- and downstream industries as well as the banking sector are affected by actual losses or&#13;
increased risks.&#13;
&#13;
73. Conservative estimates would put the total economic losses due to HPAI since October&#13;
2005 at an amount o f EUR 192 million. Since this figure only includes those for which&#13;
quantitative estimates are available inthe form o f official statistics or formal reports and claims,&#13;
actual losses are likely to be much higher.&#13;
&#13;
74. Economic Analysis of Future Project Activities. Economic benefits o f investments under&#13;
the project have been estimated through a costbenefit analysis comparing the incremental stream&#13;
o f estimated net benefits "with project" to those "without project". Recognizing that the project&#13;
supports investments that are targeted at two different scenarios that could only be combined&#13;
through the (rather arbitrary) assumption o f the probability o f the case o f a (human) influenza&#13;
pandemic, two separate models have been formulated: (i)       Avian Influenza as zoonosis, causing&#13;
widespread damage to the poultry industry but only very few (ifat all any) human infections and&#13;
deaths; and (ii)Pandemic phase with widespread human illness and death.&#13;
&#13;
(i)AvianInfluenzaaszoonosis,causingwidespreaddamagetothepoultryindustrybut&#13;
    only very few (if at all any) human infections and deaths.&#13;
&#13;
75. Economic benefits are estimated based on the project's objective to reduce economic cost&#13;
related to poultry deaths from HPAI due to the disease itself or through culling. The "without&#13;
project" scenario i s based on estimates derived from the economic losses experienced duringthe&#13;
actual outbreaks between October 2005 and July 2006 and a reference HPAI incidence rate o f&#13;
 1.4%. The successful implementation o f the project i s expected to contribute to the reduction o f&#13;
the incidence culling rates and hence reduction inthe costs to the economy. Inorder to achieve a&#13;
reference internal rate o f returno f 12% for the project's investments, an annual reduction in the&#13;
HPAI incidence rate by about 10% in the first two project years, and another 5% in year 3,&#13;
totaling about 30% at the end o f the project implementation period (i.e., after three years), would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 28 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
be required. That means, the project is worth to be undertaken if improvements in the&#13;
effectiveness o f the response of veterinary services (detection, containment, eradication) and&#13;
poultry producers (bio-security and early warning) to HPAI outbreaks lead to a reduction in the&#13;
number o f killed (by the disease) and/or culled birds from 1.41% o f the total number o f domestic&#13;
birds in Romania (actual, without project) to 0.98% with the project. These calculations have&#13;
been made using a time horizono f eight years. However, even ifHPAI disappears after a number&#13;
of years, investments supported under the project will increase in the long-term the capacity o f&#13;
veterinary and public health services to respond more effectively to other transboundary and&#13;
zoonotic diseases as well. Assumingthe standard time horizon for economic analysis o f 20 years,&#13;
a reduction inthe HPAIincidence rate by only 5% annually over the first three years (the project&#13;
implementation years) would be required, equivalent to a reduction in the culling rate from&#13;
1.41% without the project to 1.13% with the project.&#13;
&#13;
(ii)Pandemicphasewithwidespreadhumanillnessanddeath.&#13;
&#13;
76. Vaccination represents the single most cost-effective strategy to avert influenza-related&#13;
morbidity, mortality and economic consequences. The main drivers of the pharmacoeconomic&#13;
profile of influenza vaccination are the vaccine effectiveness in terms of prevention o f&#13;
hospitalization and mortality, the background incidence o f hospitalization and death in&#13;
unvaccinated individuals and the relative costing of the vaccine compared with the costs o f a&#13;
hospital in-patient day.&#13;
&#13;
77. In a pandemic situation, the Romanian vaccination policy i s relying on its national&#13;
manufacturer (Institute Cantacuzino), for the manufacturing o f around 5,500,000 univalent&#13;
vaccine doses (3rd option o f the WHO pandemic plan), which can be done in the upgraded and&#13;
expanded facility proposed under the project. This would assure the coverage o f around 25% o f&#13;
the country population. The cost of vaccination within the inter-pandemic period i s&#13;
approximately EUR 2 per dose (one dose per patient), amounting to EUR 3 million in 2005. In&#13;
case o f a pandemic, the recommended vaccine coverage should reach 30 to 50% o f the&#13;
population (monovalent), which can be realized mainly through own production and less through&#13;
imports, because inthis case WHO recommends the vaccine supplies to be directed towards non-&#13;
manufacturing countries.&#13;
&#13;
78. Assumptions on the regional (in-country) and international spread o f a pandemic, the speed&#13;
o f the intervention, the type o f intervention, and the type o f viral strain (growth potential for fast&#13;
vaccine production) are further complicating factors in modelling the economic and financial&#13;
benefits o f the proposed project. It is clear however, that increasing the capacity o f the national&#13;
producer produces the following advantages: a) increased immunization coverage resulting in&#13;
lower morbidity, b) reduced procurement costs, c) shorter response times (faster intervention by&#13;
which slowing down the spread o f the disease and reducing the morbidity, d) spare capacity in&#13;
case o f global shortage, e) better flexibility (response time, adjust to needs), f) improved access&#13;
and availability o f vaccines to district authorities, and g) immediate switch to monovalent&#13;
vaccine form and immunization ifneeded.&#13;
&#13;
79. The price o f the nationally produced influenza vaccine (seasonal) i s approximately 30%&#13;
below the prices o f multinational companies inRomania, where price levels o f influenza vaccine&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  - 29 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
are approximately half o f those in western EU countries. In the case o f a pandemic (or even&#13;
widespread endemic) price levels o f multinational products in Romania will very quickly adjust&#13;
to international price levels and vaccines might become unaffordable for the Romanian&#13;
population. The intended investments in the national vaccine production result (even without a&#13;
pandemic) in a government (or insurance fund) budget saving o f EUR 1.3 million annually (at&#13;
price and coverage level 2005). Inthe case o f a pandemic, the cost savings by far outweigh the&#13;
investment(EUR 12millionsaved through an investment o f about EUR 5 million).&#13;
&#13;
80. The economic benefits however are larger, mainly achieved by the possibility o f a faster&#13;
response, less relying on imports (in a time o f shortage), and a better adjustment to local needs&#13;
(contain the pandemic). Whether these economic benefits materialize i s largely depending on the&#13;
organizational response o f the authorities. These elements are hard to factor into an economic&#13;
impact model. The following table estimates the economic impact:&#13;

2. Technical analysis&#13;
&#13;
81. The Bank's appraisal mission, in collaboration with the AI technical lead agencies FAO,&#13;
OIE and WHO, have found the technical design of the proposed project to be appropriate,&#13;
addressing critical needs in the country's preparedness for influenza and other infectious&#13;
diseases, and to be consistent with the GPAI program including its list o f eligible activities. The&#13;
main issues are:&#13;
&#13;
82. Animal Health:&#13;
&#13;
      (i)Institutional   framework and contingency planning. In response to weaknesses&#13;
           identified during the first two waves o f AI outbreaks, the government has started to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 30 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     restructure its key veterinary institutions and to enhance their capacity. In&#13;
     collaboration with local and international partners, the proposed project will support&#13;
     the institutional capacity enhancement in critical areas such as evaluation and&#13;
     restructuring o f institutions, establishment o f animal disease control centers, and&#13;
     contingency plan implementation guidelines and manuals.&#13;
(ii)Monitoringandsurveillance. ThesecondwaveofHPAIoutbreaksinRomaniahas&#13;
      shown that the lack o f reliable epidemiological information, and the sound analysis&#13;
     thereof, has hampered the development o f rational, targeted disease control measures&#13;
     and slowed down the containment o f the disease. Veterinary capacity for monitoring,&#13;
      surveillance and epidemiological analyses is a critical factor in every AI control and&#13;
     eradication strategy. The proposed project will therefore enhance the capacity o f&#13;
     veterinary services in collecting and analyzing epidemiological data and performing&#13;
     risk assessments.&#13;
(iii)Diagnostic capacity in national and regional laboratories. Romania'slaboratories&#13;
      are comparatively well equipped for standard analytical procedures, but exceptional&#13;
     work loads and highly specialized analyses cannot be performed at the requiredspeed&#13;
      or quality level due to the lack o f specialized equipment, reagents and other&#13;
      consumables. Speed is a critical factor in the control o f highly contagious diseases&#13;
      such as HPAI. The project will increase the diagnostic capacity o f national and&#13;
     regional laboratories with small goods and consumables, technical assistance and&#13;
     training, for which no other funding sources exist.&#13;
(iv) Applied veterinary research. A Government Decision under preparation at the time&#13;
      o f project appraisal is to provide ANSVSA inthe near future with a new mandate for&#13;
     transboundary and zoonotic diseases research under the administration o f the Institute&#13;
      for Diagnosis and Animal Health, to be located at existing premises at Tulcea.&#13;
      Thematic focus, structural designs, and programs for the new applied veterinary&#13;
     research did not exist at the time o f appraisal.&#13;
&#13;
(v) Quality control for veterinary medicinal products and infectious disease research.&#13;
     Romania does not currently have the capacity to fulfill its responsibilities inproviding&#13;
      sufficient quality control for vaccine imports and other veterinary medicinal products&#13;
     which includes the test o f vaccines in live animals. Experiments with highly&#13;
      contagious pathogens require a high-containment laboratory environment that does&#13;
     not presently exist.&#13;
(vi) Animal disease information system. Outbreak information and epidemiological data&#13;
     is being reported through individual e-mail or fax communication, but there is no&#13;
      systematic filing and distribution o f this critical information. The project will support&#13;
     the establishment o f a country-wide information system, connecting local and&#13;
     national levels and relevant agencies and individuals, allowing real-time access to&#13;
     critical information for disease control.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(vii) Quarantine, culling, and disposal. Romania's large number o f small-holder poultry&#13;
      farms with sometimes as few as a dozen chicken per household (average: 20)&#13;
     dispersed across a large country pose a particular challenge for disease control&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          - 3 1 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            activities that involve culling and disposal. Culling o f backyard chicken currently&#13;
            involves non-specialized equipment. In order to increase the acceptability o f the&#13;
            measure, the project will finance the purchase and operation o f animal welfare&#13;
            acceptable COz containers. Appropriate disposal facilities don't exist at the village&#13;
            level, and the transport o f (potentially) virus-infected carcasses represents a particular&#13;
            risk o f spreading the disease even further. In this situation and for the purpose o f&#13;
            highly infectious poultry diseases, mobile incinerators have been found to be more&#13;
            appropriate than large rending plants. The project will establish appropriate disposal&#13;
            capacity at the local level in conformity with environmental, animal welfare, and&#13;
            human health standards and requirements.&#13;
      (viii)On-farm bio-security. Bio-security on commercial and backyard poultry farms is a&#13;
            critical factor in the prevention o f the spread o f infectious diseases. Especially the&#13;
            second outbreak wave has shown that bio-security i s particularly weak on Romanian&#13;
            poultry farms, given its large %age o f backyard and even urban poultry raising&#13;
            practices. Without improved on-farm bio-security, Romania will not be able to avoid&#13;
            future outbreaks o f AI or other infectious animal diseases. Recognizing that bio-&#13;
            security on poultry farms i s - primarily - the result o f managerial decisions and&#13;
            behavior, the project will support awareness campaigns and knowledge transfer&#13;
            activities, but also technical on-farm pilot projects for enhanced bio-security.&#13;
&#13;
83. Human Health. Romania i s still in phase 2 o f the inter-pandemic period and, to date no&#13;
human cases have been confirmed. However, the risk o f sporadic human infections (isolated&#13;
cases or localized outbreaks) and therefore entering into the phase 3 o f the inter-pandemic period&#13;
is highinRomania.&#13;
&#13;
      (i)Planning       and coordination. The national plan o f intervention adopted in October&#13;
            does constitute a good strategic framework and considerable attention has been paid&#13;
            to the coordination between the MPH and key stakeholders. However, the plan will&#13;
            need to be regularly updated and further operationalized taking into account the&#13;
            evolution o f the situation and lessons learned from the field. In collaboration with&#13;
            other partners ( notably USAID), the project will finance studies and research to&#13;
            provide the information neededfor these revisions and will help further strengthen the&#13;
            coordination bothwithin the health.sector and with other sectors.&#13;
      (ii)Monitoring andsurveillance. An influenza surveillance system is inplace and&#13;
            functions satisfactorily. While they have to play a central role in the surveillance o f&#13;
            communicable diseases, some o f the district health authorities do not have all the&#13;
            required capacity to investigate and control outbreaks. With the support o f the&#13;
            USAID,the MPHhas started training activities to enhance their capacity.&#13;
      (iii) Diagnostic capacity. While laboratories at the central level are well equipped and&#13;
            staffed and can performed even sophisticated analyses, the regional laboratories can&#13;
            only performed standard procedures, in some cases not at international standards and&#13;
            laboratory safety needs to be improved to allow for the manipulation o f highly&#13;
            pathogenic viruses. The project will therefore help bring up to bio-safety level 3 the&#13;
            national influenza lab and will further equip 3 regional laboratories so they can&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 32 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
           perform AI tests. Training inAI diagnostic, bio-safety and quality control will also be&#13;
           provided.&#13;
      (iv) Isolation and case management. Romania is comparatively well preparedto respond&#13;
           to limited outbreaks and isolate and treat a limited number o f patients. The&#13;
           centralization o f patient care in Bucharest hospitals i s part o f the MPH strategy to&#13;
           ensure high quality care to suspected or confirmed AI human cases. However, would&#13;
           the virus continue to spread and be present in all parts (including remote ones) o f the&#13;
           country and/or a pandemic occur, patients would need to be hospitalized and treated&#13;
           within or closer to their regions o f residence. The project will therefore support a) the&#13;
           further equipment o f the two Bucharest infectious diseases hospitals; and b) the&#13;
           establishment o f isolation and intensive care units in 7 o f the regional hospitals for&#13;
           infectious diseases (Brasov, Craiova, Constanta, Cluj, Iasi, Timisoara and Tg. Mures).&#13;
&#13;
      (v) Antiviral and other drugs. The MPH has already establish a stockpile o f antivirals&#13;
           and ifneed be could access to drugs from the WHO international stock pile. Would a&#13;
           major outbreak occur, project funds would be reallocated to help finance the purchase&#13;
           o f antivirals, antibiotics and other drugs.&#13;
&#13;
      (vi) Vaccines. Vaccine production is seen by Romania as a matter o f national interest. A&#13;
           significant part (80%) o f the 2.5 and 5.5 million doses o f influenza vaccines needed in&#13;
           Romania during the inter-pandemic and pandemic periods, respectively, could be&#13;
           produced locally by the Cantacuzino Institute. However, this requires the&#13;
           strengthening o f the existing vaccine production unit. The project will therefore&#13;
           support the upgrading o f both the influenza vaccine production unit and the filling&#13;
           and sealing station and will help ensure that the production remains in compliance&#13;
           with Good Manufacturing Practices.&#13;
&#13;
3. Fiduciary&#13;
&#13;
84. Financial Management. The financial management arrangements o f the project are&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. The project will rely to the extent possible on several elements of&#13;
financial management country systems, as follows:&#13;
&#13;
           Implementing entities - the project will be implementedby existing structures;&#13;
           Staffing - the project staff will be employees o f by the MPH and ANSVSA;&#13;
&#13;
           Internal control  -  the project will use the existing internal control framework within&#13;
           MPHand ANSVSA with additional procedures developed for the project;&#13;
           Flow o f funds - the project will use fully the Treasury for the Government&#13;
           contribution and partially, to the extent possible, for the loan funds;&#13;
           Internal audit - as the internal audit departments within MPH and ANSVSA continue&#13;
           to develop, the project will rely to the extent possible on this for the internal audit o f&#13;
           the project;&#13;
           External audit - the Romanian Supreme Audit Institution, Court o f Accounts will&#13;
           perform an operational review o f the project;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 33 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        0   Accounting and reporting system   -  the project will rely on the existing systems.&#13;
&#13;
85. As o f the date o f this report, the Borrower i s in compliance with its audit covenants o f&#13;
existing Bank-financed projects. Formats o f the interim financial reports (IFRs) and o f the audit&#13;
terms o f reference are being developed and will be agreed upon and attached to the minutes o f&#13;
negotiations. The first Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Romania was&#13;
finalized in December 2003 and concluded that the overall fiduciary risk associated with the&#13;
public financial management and financial accountability arrangements o f the Romanian&#13;
government administration i s considered to be moderate, with the systems for accounting,&#13;
financial reporting and internal control representing the areas with the higher risks and&#13;
budgeting, cash management and external audit and Parliamentary oversight representing the&#13;
lower risks.&#13;
&#13;
86. The implications o fthe CFAA for the project have been addressed by the following actions:&#13;
            A detailedreview o fthe systems was performed for the implementing entities;&#13;
        0   The implementing entities will set up distinct project-specific accounting ledgers;&#13;
        0   Project accounting staff appointedby the implementing entities;&#13;
        0   The format o f the IFRs and audit TORSagreed with the implementing entities;&#13;
            Project financial statements audited by an independent auditor annually.&#13;
&#13;
87. Procurement. The Joint Procurement Assessment Mission (JPAM) o f June 2005&#13;
concluded that the public procurement risk inRomania i s high. The capacity o f the PMUs which&#13;
will conduct procurement under Bank guidelines has been assessed in the preparation o f the&#13;
MAKIS and APL 2 Health Project and has been found satisfactory. Both PMUs will be&#13;
strengthened by hiring an additional procurement specialist for each o f the PMUs to assist them&#13;
with the additional procurement work stemming from the additional project. Appointment o f&#13;
procurement staff satisfactory to the Bank in the new ANSVSA PMU i s a condition o f&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;

&#13;
88. Activities financed under the proposed project are not expected to generate any significant&#13;
adverse environmental effect, as a large part o f the project i s geared to support prevention&#13;
activities. Overall, the project will have positive environmental and social impacts. The primary&#13;
potential environmental risks can be grouped into three categories:&#13;
&#13;
       (9   Inadvertent human exposure and spread o f the virus due to: improper culling and&#13;
            disposal o f dead birds (wildbirds, sick and dead birds from backyard and commercial&#13;
            poultries); lack of, or improper use o f personal protection equipment (PPE); improper&#13;
            disposal o f farm waste (i.e., bedding, manure, washings, etc. during and/or after an&#13;
            outbreak); and inadequate laboratory biosafety protocols.&#13;
       (ii)Inadvertent release of chemicals in the environment from unsatisfactory&#13;
            decontamination procedures (for personnel, poultry sheds, and transport vehicles,&#13;
            etc.) and from vaccination manufacturing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 34 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        (iii)Release ofchemicals and infectious agents intothe environment from inadequate&#13;
              laboratory, medical and vaccination facility waste management.&#13;
&#13;
89. The project's investments in facilities, equipment, and training for laboratories will improve&#13;
the effectiveness and safety over existing avian influenza handling and testing procedures by&#13;
meeting international standards established by OIE. Upgrading for laboratories will include&#13;
provision o f appropriate facilities and training for waste management and for bio-safety level 2&#13;
and 3 operations as well as high-containment isolators. Medical waste generated in health care&#13;
facilities will be managed using existing guidelines in Romania, which have been found&#13;
satisfactory under previous projects. The Project will also support updating these guidelines,&#13;
training o f health care workers to manage medical waste following these guidelines, and, as&#13;
appropriate, purchase o f equipment for the proper handling and disposal of medical waste in&#13;
participating facilities. As such, the project will mainstream environmental safeguards into&#13;
protocols and procedures for the culling and disposal o f animals during an outbreak, inparticular&#13;
by adopting OIE standards inthese areas, and improve bio-medical waste management systems&#13;
inhealth facilities and laboratories.&#13;
&#13;
90. Based on the project's planned activities which entail the environmental risks mentioned&#13;
above, the project has been rated "B" and requires an environmental assessment and&#13;
environmental management plan. An Environmental Assessment and an Environmental&#13;
Management Plan are being prepared. The EMP - which will become a part o f the Project&#13;
Implementation Manual - will describe the methods to be deployed for culling and the disposal&#13;
o f culled poultry, laboratory and medical facility waste management and bio-safety, and vaccine&#13;
production and handling.&#13;

Macro-economicFramework&#13;
&#13;
1.   Romania i s a middle income country with a population o f 22 millionpeople and per capita&#13;
income o f US$ 2,950 in 2004. Until 2000, the country was one o f the poorest performing&#13;
economies in the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), with a decline in gross domestic product&#13;
(GDP), and an average inflationo f 54% per year.&#13;
&#13;
2.   EU accession aspirations have enhanced macroeconomic stability and spurred renewed&#13;
commitmentto reforms inrecent years. During2000-2004 the economy grew robustly at 4 to 5%&#13;
per year, with inflation declining from above 40% in 2000 to 8.6% in 2005, the lowest level&#13;
since the start o f transition.   Structural and institutional reform accelerated during the same&#13;
period - private sector share o f GDP has moved closer to EU-8 levels, more than 90% o f&#13;
banking assets are now held by the private sector, energy reform has resulted in a substantial&#13;
reduction o f quasi-fiscal deficits, and independence o f the judiciary has been strengthened. The&#13;
Accession Treaty was signed on April 25, 2005 and entry i s expected to take place on January 1,&#13;
2007. Romania faces the challenge o f convergence with EU countries in terms o f both incomes&#13;
and living standards - its per capita GDP in 2004 i s about one-third o f EU-15 and it lags in&#13;
several social indicators. About 19% of the population still lives below the povertyline.&#13;
&#13;
3.   According to the OIE (the World Animal Health Organization) statistics, Romanian ranks&#13;
among the first ten countries which have reported the presence o f the highly pathogenic avian&#13;
influenza (HPAI), subtype H5N1 in poultry. Romania first reported a suspected case o f AI on&#13;
October 7, 2005 in a backyard farm of Ceamurlia-de-Jos inthe Danube Delta region. On October&#13;
13, 2005 tests performed by the Romanian National Reference Laboratory (RNRL) confirmed&#13;
that the virus found was o f the H5N1 strain. From October 7, 2005 to April 24, 2006, 53&#13;
outbreaks were confirmed in52 localities from 9 counties inthe Danube Delta and the Black Sea&#13;
area: Tulcea, Braila, Buzau, Calarasi, Constanta, Dambovita, Dolj, Ialomita and Ilfov counties.&#13;
On April 21, 2006, the last outbreak o f avian influenza in Romania ended (Deleni&#13;
village/Constanta county). All outbreaks occurred in small backyard premises and no&#13;
commercial farms were affected. From October 2005 to April 2006, Romania adopted two&#13;
different control measures in order to control the disease: stamping out (46 outbreaks) and&#13;
zoning (7 outbreaks). During this period, 421,470 birds from 16,166 backyard premises were&#13;
destroyed. In early M a y 2006, the disease reoccurred and the presence o f the HPAI was&#13;
confirmed on M a y 14, 2006. The first outbreaks were detected in Codlea, Fagaras (Brasov&#13;
county) in a commercial farm, SC DRAKOM SILVA SRL. This farm had more than 105,000&#13;
broiler chickens. On June 7, 2006, the total number o f outbreaks went up to 127. The outbreaks&#13;
spread across 18 counties and also reached Bucharest. From M a y 2006, 210,470 birds from&#13;
backyard premises and 764,865 birds from the commercial farms in Codlea (Brasov county)&#13;
were killed.&#13;

APriculture and Poultry Sector&#13;
&#13;
4.    Agriculture plays a key role inRomania's economy, its share inGDP being around 11-14%.&#13;
In addition, agriculture continues to be the largest employer in Romania, accounting for more&#13;
than 30% o f the labor force, most o f which are in subsistence agriculture. Poultry production i s&#13;
widespread across the country, with the backyard holdings accounting for 70% o f Romania's&#13;
total poultry production. The particular structural challenge lies inthe low bio-security standards&#13;
o f smallholder poultry operations inherent in their fragmented structure and traditional poultry&#13;
and livestock management practices. Typical household in Romania comprises chickens, ducks,&#13;
turkeys, geese, swine, sheep and goats, cows and horses living in an immediate proximity.&#13;
Keeping o f domestic animals, and especially poultry, i s extremely extensive in Romanian&#13;
villages, which means that poultry, andparticularly ducks and geese, freely graze during the day.&#13;
Poultry production inRomanian villages i s essential for the owners who, at the time, do not have&#13;
any other alternative for keeping and housing their poultry. The poultry owners use the poultry&#13;
for their own consumption, but there is also a live poultrytrade at the localmarkets.&#13;
&#13;
5.    As regards the commercial poultry production, this appears to be highly concentrated.&#13;
According to the Romanian Poultry Producers Association, there are 15 large producers of&#13;
poultry meat who hold about 60% o f the total domestic production. They rely on integrated&#13;
establishments that autonomously produce broiler chickens and poultry feed, and have their own&#13;
slaughterhouses. There are also 20 middle and 43 small producers, yielding 30% and lo%,&#13;
respectively, o f the domestic commercial poultry output.&#13;
&#13;
6.    In2005 the total Romanianconsumption ofpoultry (self-consumption excluded) went upto&#13;
around 375,000 tons, reflecting an increase by 19% as compared to the previous year. The&#13;
consumers favored poultry to other meat, given its lower prices. Out o f the total poultry&#13;
consumption, 220,000 tons were provided by the domestic producers (59%), with the domestic&#13;
output o f poultry practically doubling from 2000. If production for self-consumption was also&#13;
considered, the total domestic output o fpoultry could be estimated around 360,000 tons.&#13;
&#13;
7.    Overall, 2005 was considered as exceptional for the poultry industry, in spite o f the&#13;
downward trends recorded towards the end o f the year, due to the HPAI. The poultry producers&#13;
invested heavily in their production capacities in order both to meet consumers' demands and to&#13;
comply with the new legal requirements. Yet, starting with the last trimester o f 2005, the&#13;
Romanian poultry industry was marked by the effects o f the AI. According to the Romanian&#13;
Poultry Producers Association, the losses caused by the disease totaled EUR 70 million. They&#13;
were due to sales price drop, delays inpopulating farms and storage costs. The stocks o f poultry&#13;
meat increased massively from about 5,000 tons in October 2005 to 20,000 tons at the end o f the&#13;
year. Nevertheless, they dropped a couple o f months later, reaching 10,000 tons in February&#13;
2006. In spite o f these signs o f recovery, the M a y episode o f the AI brought about a very sharp&#13;
decrease o f poultry meat consumption (by 50-80% duringthe first days o f outbreaks).&#13;
&#13;
8.    Responsibility for the ongoing surveillance and monitoring for the HPAI in poultry and&#13;
migratory fowl and for response in case o f an outbreak rests with the National Sanitary,&#13;
Veterinary and Food Safety Authority (ANSVSA). ANSVSA was established in 2004 as the&#13;
main body in charge with the food safety and animal health, subordinated to the Romanian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 38 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Government and under the coordination o f the Ministry o f Agriculture, Forests and Rural&#13;
Development (MAFRD). The Authority currently functions according to the provisions o f the&#13;
Government Decision no. 130/2006. The Romanian Parliament authorized ANSVSA to be the&#13;
contact structure with the European Food Safety Authority and to act on functional and&#13;
decisional autonomy, according to the commitments made by Romania in its international&#13;
relations. The ANSVSA services extend over 90,000 producers, processors and marketing units,&#13;
to which approximately 2,200,000 individual holdings add. The human resources the Agency&#13;
relies on include own staff, but also contracted veterinarians.&#13;
&#13;
9.    The Romanian veterinary services are provided both on a public and on a private basis. The&#13;
public veterinary services are organized as a top-down system, covering the central, county and&#13;
local levels. There are several bodies subordinated to the ANSVSA, who i s the central&#13;
institution. On one hand, there are the 42 County Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Agencies&#13;
(Bucharest included), which also incorporate the regional sanitary and veterinary units, and the&#13;
local sanitary, veterinary and food safety units. On the other hand, there are three public&#13;
institutions, acting in the veterinary field: (1) the Institute for Diagnosis and Animal Health&#13;
(IDAH), (2) the Institute for the Control of Biological Products and Veterinary Drugs, and (3)&#13;
the Institute for Veterinary Hygiene and Public Health (IVHPH). In addition to these, the&#13;
organizational structure o f the ANSVSA comprises the border inspection posts (BIPs).&#13;
&#13;
10. In response to the threat o f HPAI outbreak, the Romanian Government has established&#13;
emergency-specific institutional structures for coordination and control measures, both at the&#13;
central and the local levels. Through Order no. 146/2005, the ANSVSA established a National&#13;
Disease Command Center as well as Local Disease Command Centers, as components o f its&#13;
organizational structure. They can be converted into disease-specific command centers,&#13;
according to needs. According to the Contingency (Emergency) Plan for AI o f Romania, these&#13;
bodies operate as emergency-specific structures. Ifthe animal disease spreads beyond the control&#13;
o f these specific structures, they will ask for the activation o f the general structures (i.e. the&#13;
Central and Local Anti-Epizootic Command Centers).&#13;
&#13;
11. According to the Government Decision no. 1218/2005, the Central Anti-Epizootic&#13;
Command Center i s headed by the Minister o f Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development. Its&#13;
vice-president i s the head o f the ANSVSA, while its members are the representatives o f nine&#13;
other ministries. However, on 24 M a y 2006 the leadership o f the Anti-Epizootic Command&#13;
Center was taken over by the Prime Minister. On 26 M a y 2006 the latter decided to also set up a&#13;
National Center for the Coordination o f Fight against the AI, whose role will be to provide&#13;
qualified advice to the Central Anti-Epizootic Command Center. The newly born center i s&#13;
chaired by the president o f the ANSVSA and comprises representatives o f 6 ministries. Its&#13;
meetings are open for the participation o f various other experts, invited according to needs.&#13;
&#13;
12. Romania has received and continues to have access to substantial donor support in its&#13;
HPAI-response activities. EU support through Phare and SAPARD grants predominantly target&#13;
the upgrading o f diagnostic and institutional capacities. After the first confirmed outbreak,&#13;
immediate support was provided by USAID, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Germany (through&#13;
FA0 TA). These donors continue their support to date. Preparedness and response assessments&#13;
have been carried out by FAO, WHO, and CDC. In addition to the proposed project, Bank&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                                - 39 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
assistance to the agriculture sector includes the ongoing Modernizing the Agricultural&#13;
Knowledge and Information System (MAKIS), Agricultural Pollution Control Project (APCP),&#13;
Rural Finance Project (RFP), Forestry Development Project (FDP), Rural Development Project&#13;
(RDP), Iri-igation Rehabilitation Project, Hazard Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness&#13;
Project&#13;
&#13;
Health Sector&#13;
&#13;
13. In Romania, the Ministry o f Public Health (MPH) i s the main responsible authority for&#13;
ensuring public health against the HPAI. There are 42 County Public Health Departments&#13;
(Bucharest included), under its subordination, that represent the public health authority at the&#13;
local level and implementthe strategy o f the MPH.&#13;
&#13;
14. Health services are provided both on a public and a private basis. The public system&#13;
comprises various types o f health units (hospitals, polyclinics, diagnosis and treatment centers,&#13;
surgeries etc.) subordinated directly to the MPH or to the County Public Health Departments.&#13;
Their funding comes either from the state budget (subsidies) or from own resources (contracts&#13;
with the public health insurance fund). The private system covers mainly smaller and more&#13;
specialized health care units (e.g. surgeries and specialized surgeries, medical centers). While&#13;
there i s an increasing share o f polyclinics with major private ownership, the number o f private&#13;
hospitals remains very low.&#13;
&#13;
15. The national research infrastructure for human health i s either subordinated to or&#13;
coordinated by the MPH. Inaddition to hospitals and universities, public bodies subordinated to&#13;
the MPH include several municipal Institutes and Centers for Public Health (e.g. the Institute for&#13;
Public Health o f Bucharest) and ensure the scientific grounds for the health policy and for the&#13;
strategies inthe area o f prevention, promoting and preserving health. They develop public health&#13;
studies, elaborate norms and methodologies, produce reports and coordinate some of the public&#13;
health programs. The public bodies coordinated by the MPH comprise (1) the "Cantacuzino"&#13;
National Institute for Research and Development in Microbiology and Immunology, (2) the&#13;
"Victor Babes" National Institute for Research and Development in Pathology and Biomedical&#13;
Sciences, and (3) National Institute for Research and Development in Health. Of these three&#13;
institutions, the Cantacuzino Institute has developed, with its own budgetary resources, a&#13;
reference laboratory designated for seasonal avianhuman influenza diagnostics.&#13;
&#13;
16. Currently, inRomania there i s one World Bank project under implementation inthe health&#13;
sector, namely the second phase o f the Health Sector Reform Project (APL).&#13;

1.    Total component costs are estimated at EUR 14.30 million, with Bank financing in the&#13;
amount o f EUR 9.15 million.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
A1  - StrengtheningVeterinary      Institutions&#13;
&#13;
2.    Evaluation of National Veterinary Services. The organizational and functional review o f&#13;
the main governmental veterinary services undertaken by experts from EUmember countries and&#13;
international organizations, and the rapid assessment undertaken by the Bank team, suggest the&#13;
need for an in-depth assessment o f the national veterinary services, followed by appropriate&#13;
reforms as may be warranted. To meet international standards set by the World Organization for&#13;
Animal Health (OIE), the EU requirements, and the recommendations developed by FA0 and&#13;
EU experts, the veterinary services need to develop and document appropriate procedures and&#13;
standards for the implementation and management o f animal health measures and international&#13;
veterinary certification activities. As a basis for activities in support o f institutional&#13;
enhancements (below), the project will provide technical assistance to support the self-evaluation&#13;
o f and by the national veterinary services based on OIE's "Performance, Vision and Strategy for&#13;
Veterinary Services" evaluation guidelines in order to establish the current level o f performance,&#13;
form a shared vision with service providers and clients in the private sector, establish priorities,&#13;
and facilitate strategic planning.&#13;
&#13;
3.    Strengthening Veterinary and Food Safety Institutions. Once the evaluation o f veterinary&#13;
and related services (above) has been completed, the project will provide technical support for&#13;
realigning institutional structures and resources with priority objectives, mandates, and tasks. In&#13;
collaboration with and complementary to ongoing and planned advisory activities funded by&#13;
donors and international organizations, the project will provide technical assistance for&#13;
institutional and organizational restructuring at national and county levels as may be warranted;&#13;
training o f staff; equipment and materials, and upgrading o f priority infrastructure (limited works&#13;
for refurbishments) including support at the county level to enhance institutional arrangements,&#13;
such as the recruitment and payment procedures for additional culling personnel, for the control&#13;
o f animal disease outbreaks. In particular, the project will support the establishment o f animal&#13;
disease control centers at the national and county levels.&#13;

4.    Contingency Plan Implementation Guidelines and Manuals. European Council Directive&#13;
2005/94/EC obliges every EU Member Country to draw up a national contingency plan&#13;
specifying the national measures to be implementedin the event o f an outbreak. Romania as an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 54 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
EUcandidate country therefore needs to design a national plan in accordance with the Directive&#13;
provisions. Inthis plan and related manuals, detailed information must be given, inter alia, about&#13;
the staff involved in control measures, their skills and responsibilities, as well as detailed&#13;
instructions for staff with respect to reporting duties, field measures such as quarantining, culling&#13;
and disinfection, location o f and access to equipment and materials, and personal protection&#13;
against the potential risk o f infection. While governmental authorities have developed individual&#13;
contingency plans for animal and human health, overall national contingency planning and&#13;
coordination still needs improvements. The Government has established a National Disease (AI)&#13;
Control Center that has started a comprehensive process o f reviewing, integrating, and&#13;
consolidating existing contingency plans. The project will provide technical assistance to support&#13;
this process o f refining and finalizing the draft contingency plan(s) and to develop the necessary&#13;
detailed implementation guidelines and manuals for all relevant agencies and services. Support&#13;
will also be provided for the participation o f veterinary experts and project staff inregional and&#13;
international information exchanges on avian influenza as well as for working visits to other&#13;
countries implementing similar activities.&#13;
&#13;
(B)StrengtheningDisease Surveillance, Diagnostic Capacity, and Research&#13;
&#13;
B1- StrengtheningMonitoring and Surveillance Systems&#13;
&#13;
5.   Surveillance Capacity of Veterinary Services. Surveillance programs entail structured&#13;
sampling approaches to search for evidence o f disease in animal populations. Examples include&#13;
regular routine repeat serum sampling inregional or national populations or in sentinel flocks or&#13;
in surveillance zones inan outbreak situation, and also continuous collection o f dead waterfowl&#13;
to be examined for evidence of HPAI. The project will provide technical assistance and training&#13;
for staff o f veterinary service institutions at national and county levels, focusing on the design&#13;
and implementation o f HPAI surveillance programs, collecting and analyzing epidemiological&#13;
data and performing risk assessments (support for serological testing under active surveillance&#13;
schemes i s provided under the diagnostic capacity component B2). The project will also support&#13;
transportation facilities and arrangements for surveillance field work as needed.&#13;
&#13;
6.   Epidemiological Surveys. European Council Directive 2005/94/EC (dated December 20,&#13;
2005) on Community measures for the control o f avian influenza and repealing Directive&#13;
92/40/EEC requires EU Member States (MS) to "ensure that epidemiological inquiries are&#13;
started on the basis of questionnaires, established within theframework of the contingency plans&#13;
providedfor in Article 62." These inquiries need to include, inter alia, the period o f infection on&#13;
the premises, possible virus origin, identification o f contact holdings, and movement o f poultry&#13;
and poultry products, persons, vehicles and other material. EU MS have the duty to inform the&#13;
E C and other MS if the results o f the epidemiological inquiries suggest transboundary&#13;
transmission of the virus. The second wave o f outbreaks in Romania, starting on M a y 11, 2006,&#13;
has shown that the lack o f reliable epidemiological information, and the sound analysis thereof,&#13;
has hampered the development o f rational, targeted disease control measures and slowed down&#13;
the containment o f the disease. The project will provide technical assistance and training for&#13;
epidemiological studies and surveillance programs to support continuously adapted and&#13;
improved disease control measures. In Romania where 70% o f poultry i s produced in backyard&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
systems, small-scale and semi-commercial poultry production systems are the major control&#13;
target.&#13;
&#13;
B2 Strengthening Diagnostic Capacity&#13;
    -&#13;
&#13;
7.   Diagnostic capacity in Romania's national reference laboratory (IDAH) and county&#13;
laboratories. Romania's veterinary diagnostic service is organized in the National Reference&#13;
Laboratory (IDAH) and 41 regional laboratories. During the first outbreak o f H5N1 HPAI in&#13;
Romania, diagnosis o f AI was performed by classical methods, i.e. virus isolation in chicken&#13;
embryos, as well as detection o f specific antibodies through hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and&#13;
imunodiffusion tests. IDAH recently adopted molecular diagnostic techniques that could speed&#13;
up diagnostic procedure and process a large number o f samples on a daily basis. Currently, there&#13;
are two Real-Time PCR machines, but the capacity should be further strengthened to process the&#13;
required number o f samples that could arise if the virus spreads further. Eight regional&#13;
laboratories adopted conventional PCR techniques. PCR techniques require specific and&#13;
expensive reagents. Pathogenicity o f the isolated viruses i s currently determined in IDAH by&#13;
genetic sequencing. The existing device i s a single capillary sequencer in which only a limited&#13;
number o f samples can be processed daily. Purchasing a four capillary sequencer will increase&#13;
IDAH's capacity for the determination o f pathogenicity o f isolated AI strains. Results obtained&#13;
by this method may also be used for future applied veterinary research. Testing by ELISA o f&#13;
serum samples collected on a large scale in surveillance programs will strengthen the diagnostics&#13;
o f AI based on the detection o f specific antibodies. This method allows processing o f a large&#13;
number o f samples within one day, but also requires specific and expensive diagnostic kits.&#13;
IDAHandmost o fthe regionallaboratoriesare equippedto use ELISA. Methods that are already&#13;
in use in Romania's veterinary diagnostic laboratories and those that will be adopted require&#13;
basic protection equipment and training activities in order to prevent possible infection o f the&#13;
laboratory staff with H5N1 HPAI. The equipment and activities should be in compliance with&#13;
the respective appropriate biosafety standards.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
9.    Quality control of veterinary medicinal products. This sub-component will provide&#13;
equipment, consumables, technical assistance and training for increasing the capacity o f the&#13;
Institute for Control o f Biological Products and Veterinary Drugs to fulfill its responsibility in&#13;
providing quality control for vaccines and other veterinary medicinal products for which formal&#13;
quality assurance has to be provided by the State. The project will also provide high-level&#13;
containment facilities available to work with live animals (see component B4).&#13;

     -&#13;
&#13;
10. This sub-component will support the further development o f a comprehensive national&#13;
animal disease information system at ANSVSA. The project's contribution to the development o f&#13;
this integrated geo-referenced information system i s incremental to the already initiated&#13;
investment in a veterinary laboratory network being developed by ANSVSA with financial&#13;
support made available through E C SAPARD. Other information networks dealing with animal&#13;
health related aspects (e.g. trade in livestock and products o f animal origin, livestock&#13;
identification and movement control, border inspection post operations, etc.) are hosted by&#13;
different entities within and . outside ANSVSA. Notwithstanding the present hosting&#13;
arrangements, the information available through links and networks is fully accessible through&#13;
the project supported ANSVSA integrated animal health information system. The system will&#13;
enable Romania to participate in global disease information sharing and comply with its&#13;
obligations as a member o f OIE, contributing towards progressively better global and regional&#13;
control and eradication. The system will be linked with rapid and standardized methods of&#13;
routine analysis o f surveillance data in order to track important changes in the H5N1 situation&#13;
and promptly supply this information to field personnel. The system supported under the project&#13;
i s intended to enable an effective and efficient flow o f information among relevant agencies and&#13;
individuals (esp. field veterinarians, laboratory experts, epidemiologists, etc.), providing the&#13;
necessary support to decision-makers charged with the prevention and control o f animal diseases&#13;
at local and national levels. The project supported integrated animal disease information system&#13;
i s owned by ANSVSA and will be operated and maintained under ANSVSA's responsibility.&#13;
Specialized service providers will to be contracted for such maintenance work. The project will&#13;
provide technical assistance, priority equipment and supplies, and training, for the design,&#13;
establishment and use o f the system. The animal health information system also includes a geo-&#13;
referenced database for all poultry farms, in line with the requirement that municipalities register&#13;
all backyard flocks under their authority.&#13;

 11. Applied Veterinary Research Program. It is widely believed that infection with H5N1&#13;
HPAIvirus was introduced into Romaniabywild migratory birds and spread to domestic poultry&#13;
inthe Danube delta in early October 2005. However, it remains unclear if and how wild birds&#13;
have passed the virus on to domestic poultry. It is also not clear to which extent the virus has&#13;
become endemic in Romania's wild bird or domestic poultry populations. Furthermore, it is not&#13;
clear whether wild migratory birds still play an important role in spreading of the virus. The role&#13;
o f wild birds and virus transmission mechanisms may need further investigation through applied&#13;
veterinary research. A Government Decision i s being prepared for early implementation to&#13;
establish the Research Center for Cross border Diseases, Emergencies, Reemergence and&#13;
Zoonoses as part o f the Institute for Diagnosis and Animal Health, providing ANSVSA with the&#13;
mandate to undertake applied veterinary research. A skeleton building has been reportedly&#13;
identified in Tulcea to house the new Center. The project will finance technical assistance to&#13;
assist with the design o f ANSVSA's applied research program related to HPAI. Twinning&#13;
arrangements with appropriate institutions outside Romania may be explored inorder to facilitate&#13;
sustained capacity strengthening. Inaddition technical assistance will be made available through&#13;

the project to design the overall reconstruction and refurbishing o f the building reportedly&#13;
allocated to house the Center.&#13;
&#13;
12. Infectious disease research on live animals. Research with highly infectious agents (such&#13;
as HPAI virus) on live animals - as may be requiredfor the testing o f vaccines and the practicing&#13;
o f vaccination and post-vaccination sampling - requires a high-containment laboratory&#13;
environment. The project will finance goods, consumables, and civil works for minor&#13;
refurbishments in existing laboratory facilities for the installation and operation o f isolators at the&#13;
Institute for Control o f BiologicalProducts and Veterinary Drugs.&#13;

&#13;
C1  - TargetingVirus     Eradicationat the Source&#13;
&#13;
13. Quarantine, Culling and Disposal. Although capable teams are in place to effectively&#13;
control H P A I outbreaks, the recent wave o f out outbreaks has overwhelmed authorities and&#13;
veterinary services. The wide distribution o f small flocks across a country where 70% o f poultry&#13;
are produced in backyard systems is a particular challenge for the control o f the disease. The&#13;
project will contribute to the enhancement o f existing capacities for the control o f HPAI&#13;
outbreaks as requiredby existing national contingency plans. Weaknesses have been identified in&#13;
the areas o f quarantining (disinfection stations), culling o f infected and at-risk poultry, and the&#13;
safe disposal o f poultry carcasses and potentially infectious materials in a bio-secure and&#13;
environmentally acceptable manner. Disinfection practices will be improved with support from&#13;
other than project sources. The project will focus its assistance on the culling o f poultry and on&#13;
the disposal o f carcasses in small-holder systems - which dominate Romania's poultry sector.&#13;
The project will finance the purchase and operation o f containers where C 0 2 i s applied in an&#13;
animal welfare acceptable manner. The project will also finance the purchase and operation o f&#13;
mobile incinerators with a combined daily capacity o f about 40,000 kg. These incinerators will&#13;
be located at a central location in each o f 4 regions: Cluj, Iasi, Bucharest, Timisoara. The&#13;
incinerators will be maintained by the local veterinary authorities who will also undergo training&#13;
for handling and managing the equipment.&#13;
&#13;
C2 - SupportingVaccination Campaigns&#13;
&#13;
14. Vaccination planning and implementation. Vaccination o f poultry against HPAI is a&#13;
controversial issue but continues to be discussed as an option to contain HPAI outbreaks. The&#13;
controversy stems from the possibility that vaccinated poultry may become infected without&#13;
showing clinical signs and may consequently continue to excrete the virus into the environment.&#13;
Moreover, infected domestic waterfowls seem to carry the virus without showing any clinical&#13;
signs and therefore pose a major risk o f spreading the virus to other domestic poultry as masked&#13;
carriers. Continuous infections and endemism could be the result. On the other hand, vaccination&#13;
does increase the threshold for the infection, and if vaccinated birds become infected, they will&#13;
excrete the virus ina significantly lower amount and during a shorter period o f time. Vaccination&#13;
can be an effective tool in situations where other measures failed to control the infection and&#13;
where the disease became endemic. However, to reduce the risk o f negative effects, vaccination&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 58 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
campaigns need to use vaccines that allow the distinction between infected and vaccinated&#13;
animals and need to be accompaniedby appropriate surveillance schemes and restrictions.&#13;
&#13;
15. Effectiveness o f vaccination in controlling H P A I in Italy i s well documented and recent&#13;
experiences regarding vaccination in controlling H5N1 HPAI in Vietnam and China are also&#13;
encouraging. Therefore, although vaccination against H P A I is generally prohibited inthe EU, the&#13;
recent Council Directive 2005/94/EC considers that "Vaccination against avian influenza can be&#13;
an effective tool to supplement disease control measures and to avoid massive killing and&#13;
destruction o f poultry or other captive birds. Current knowledge suggests that vaccination may&#13;
be useful not only as a short-term measure in emergencies but also as a long-term measure to&#13;
prevent disease in situations o f higher risk of introduction of avian influenza viruses from wild&#13;
life or other sources." The same Directive offers the option o f Emergency vaccination: "A&#13;
Member state may introduce emergency vaccination in poultry or other captive birds as a short&#13;
term measure to contain an outbreak when a risk assessment indicates there i s a significant and&#13;
immediate threat o f avian influenza spreading within or into the Member State concerned in&#13;
accordance with this Section where there is one or more o f the following: (a) an outbreak within&#13;
that Member State; (b) an outbreak in a nearby Member State; or (c) where avian influenza has&#13;
been confirmed inpoultry or other captive birds in a nearby third country" as well as Preventive&#13;
vaccination: "Member States may introduce preventive vaccination in poultry or other captive&#13;
birds as a long term measure in accordance with this Section where they deem that on the basis&#13;
o f a risk assessment certain areas o f their territory, type o f poultry husbandry or certain&#13;
categories of poultry or other captive birds or the poultry or other captive birds compartments are&#13;
exposed to the risk o f avian influenza." Romania, as a candidate country, has a legal option for&#13;
using vaccination against HPAI as an additional tool for controlling H5N1 in poultry. A policy&#13;
on the use o f vaccination for the containment o f HPAIoutbreaks has not yet been formulated nor&#13;
has a contingency plan for the practical the implementation o f a potential vaccination campaign&#13;
been drafted.&#13;
&#13;
16. The project will therefore provide technical assistance and training including orientation&#13;
visits to other countries, to develop Romania's vaccination policy and action plan in the form o f&#13;
detailed operational manual for vaccinations against HPAI, and train officials in the&#13;
implementation o f vaccination campaigns and post-vaccinationmonitoring.&#13;
&#13;
(D)ImprovingBio-securityinpoultryproductionandtrade&#13;
&#13;
17. Bio-security on small-scalepoultry farms. After the first wave o f AI outbreaks inRomania&#13;
which is believed to have been caused by wild birds inthe Danube Delta region, the second wave&#13;
revealed that inappropriate farm management and trade practices can have equally dramatic&#13;
effects on the spread o f the disease. However, most o f Romania's H5N1 HPAI outbreaks&#13;
occurred inbackyard poultry systems where 70% o f the country's poultry are kept, revealing that&#13;
bio-security on backyard farms is insufficient and represents a major risk for new waves o f&#13;
infections. On these farms, a farm household typically keeps 20 chickens, 10 ducks, 5 turkeys, 3&#13;
geese, 3 swine, 10 sheep and goats, a cow and a horse living inimmediate proximity, sometimes&#13;
roaming freely around the farm, adding to the risk o f both (i) mixing o f wild and domestic birds,&#13;
and (i)  species-to-species transmission and mutation or even recombination o f the virus. In&#13;
addition, live poultry trade at the local markets is common, which can significantly contribute to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 59 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the spread o f H5N1 between villages. For Romania in particular it has become decisive to&#13;
upgrade the level o f bio-security on its farms inorder to reduce the chances o f virus transmission&#13;
(i) between wild and domestic birds, (ii)    between animals (species) on farms, and (iii)  between&#13;
farms. Bio-security i s as much a behavioral issue as i t is a technical one and i s the result o f&#13;
managerial decisions (such as restricted access to poultry production farms, quarantining o f new&#13;
purchases, separation o f sick animals, separation o f species, personal hygiene, etc). Support&#13;
activities for Bio-security enhancements will therefore have to include awareness campaigns and&#13;
knowledge transfer activities for producers, rural families, and other local stakeholders, Small&#13;
investments may be neededon some farms, depending on the characteristics o f the local farming&#13;
system. These systems can vary considerable. The project will therefore also support a&#13;
comprehensive poultry sector assessment, based on which technical options and communication&#13;
approaches will be defined to deal with aspects o f biosecurity, resulting in the publication o f&#13;
biosecurity manuals for different stakeholders. In parallel, some technical options should be&#13;
tested and demonstrated to poultry producers in selected areas. Such technical options could&#13;
involve fencing, compartmentalization, caging (at least temporarily), and manure disposal, and&#13;
other technical and managerial innovations.        Investment costs, knowledge and management&#13;
skills, labor for husbandry including feeding, fodder costs, and the emotional impact o f changing&#13;
the look and feel o f animal production systems are critical factors in the evaluation o f the&#13;
feasibility and social acceptance o f bio-security improvements. Ultimate scaling up o f on-farm&#13;
bio-security investments on individual farms (not initially included inthe project) would need to&#13;
present several options and assist farmers inmaking an informed choice.&#13;
&#13;
18. The project will finance:&#13;
&#13;
       (i)Knowledge      transfer activities - including on-farm demonstrations and training o f&#13;
            farmers, extension agents, and other rural services providers - aimed at managerial&#13;
            and behavioral changes. These also deal with training o f staff and workers involved in&#13;
            the culling and disposal operations inthe face o f outbreaks.&#13;
       (ii)Technical assistancefor acomprehensivepoultry sector assessment,leadingtothe&#13;
            review o f options and subsequently to the publication o fbiosecurity manuals.&#13;
&#13;
Component2 -HUMANHEALTH&#13;
&#13;
 19. The Human Health Component will comprise three subcomponents for a total estimated&#13;
cost o f EUR 19.80 million, with Bank financing inthe amount o f EUR 16.95 million.&#13;
&#13;
(A)EnhancingPublicHealthProgramPlanningandCoordination&#13;
&#13;
20. The National Plan o f intervention in a flu pandemic situation, which was approved on&#13;
 October 13, 2005 by the Ministry o f Public Health (Order N o 1094), presents the general&#13;
 strategy for the preparation for and response to an influenza pandemic o f avian origin. The M P H&#13;
 Order N o 31 adopted on January 12, 2006 completes the national plan by presenting the&#13;
methodology for the surveillance and management o f AI human cases. Several other MPH orders&#13;
have been adopted and published on the MPH website in both Romanian and English language&#13;
 (See ww.ms.ro).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 60 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21. The National Plan defines the composition o f both the National Committee and the County&#13;
Committees for flu pandemic, while Order No 31 defines the circuit for information and&#13;
identifies the institutions responsible for the laboratory investigations and the clinical&#13;
management o f cases. The Directia de Sanatate Publica (DSP- Direction o f Public Health) holds&#13;
the overall responsibility for the surveillance and control o f Avian Influenza in Human. All&#13;
suspected human cases have to be transported to and hospitalized at the Institute o f Infectious&#13;
Diseases Dr Matei Bals in Bucharest. The Cantocuzino Institute i s responsible for laboratory&#13;
testing and confirmations. All suspected cases should be reported to the County Public Health&#13;
Departments, which shall recommend measures to be taken (hospitalization, home isolation,&#13;
treatments o f contact persons...) and shall report all events to both the National Center for&#13;
Communicable Disease control andthe Cantacuzino Institute the Institute Matei Bals.&#13;
&#13;
22. Overall the plan and various orders constitute a good strategic framework and provide good&#13;
general guidance for action. They closely follow the WHO recommendations, address most o f&#13;
the issues and broadly present the actions to be taken during the 6 phases o f the pre-pandemic&#13;
and pandemic periods.&#13;
&#13;
23. Romania i s already benefiting from a US$ 1.3 million USAlD project which i s providing&#13;
technical assistance for the development o f the national emergency preparedness plan and&#13;
training on planning as well as the preparation of technical guidelines and manuals.&#13;
&#13;
24. The project will finance additional work to further operationalize the national plan and&#13;
enhance coordination with both other sectors and neighboring countries. More specifically the&#13;
project will a) finance additional studies and researches, including a study on the kinetics and&#13;
impact o f a pandemic and, b) the organization o f conferences, workshops and consensus&#13;
meetings.&#13;
&#13;
(B)Strengthening Surveillance and the national laboratory capacity&#13;
&#13;
25. In Romania, the surveillance o f the seasonal influenza i s in place since about 15 years, is&#13;
well organized and functions well. The Romania National Influenza Center is recognized by&#13;
WHO and is affiliated with the WHO FLUNET and the EuropeanInfluenza Surveillance System&#13;
(EISS). The NIL i s in contact with the London and U S Atlanta-CDC international reference&#13;
laboratories and centers. The N I C participates inthe national surveillance of Avian Fluand in all&#13;
preparedness activities for an influenza pandemic. At this point in time and based on the&#13;
information available, there i s no need to further strengthen the existing sentinel surveillance&#13;
system and no action i s required inthe short term.&#13;
&#13;
26. At the central level, the M P H (DSP) Public Health Department has the overall&#13;
responsibility for the prevention and fight against avian flu in humans while the 42 existing&#13;
District Public Health Departments are directly responsible for the investigation o f AI outbreaks.&#13;
N o major issues have been reported in the past months and the last W H O K D C mission&#13;
considered as globally satisfactory the investigation o f outbreaks. However, the increasing&#13;
number o f AI outbreaks reported inpoultry and the increasing risk to have to face human cases&#13;
requires the strengthening o f existing capacity to investigate and control outbreak. Support&#13;
towards this is providedby USAID.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 61 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27. The Romania National Influenza Reference Laboratory-NIL is located at the Cantacuzino&#13;
Institute. The Laboratory has been recently renovated (with the support o f the EU-Phare&#13;
Program), i s well equipped (RT-PCR, sequencer) and at bio-safety level 2. This laboratory i s&#13;
recognized by W.H.O. The Professor Dr Matei Bals Institute o f Infectious Diseases inBucharest&#13;
has also a well staffed and fully equipped laboratory at bio-safety level 2. All districts have&#13;
laboratories able to perform main microbiological tests, though only some o f them at&#13;
international standards. While overall the laboratory capacity appears appropriate and at the&#13;
requiredlevel, there is a need to further strengthen the NILand regional national laboratories.&#13;
&#13;
28. The project will finance:&#13;
&#13;
        (a) The upgrading o f the NIL to BSL 3 through the financing o f minor civil works&#13;
            (partitioning and creation o f decontamination rooms), the supply and installation o f&#13;
             additional security devices and the installation o f system for maintaining negative&#13;
            pressure inthe rooms.&#13;
        (b) The strengthening o f at least 3 regional laboratories through the supply o f critical&#13;
            equipment and the training o f staff.&#13;
&#13;
(C)StrengtheningHealthSystemResponse Capacity&#13;
&#13;
29. The health care system appears relatively well prepared to respond to isolated cases and&#13;
limited outbreaks. However, additional efforts are needed to ensure that the system can&#13;
adequately respond to a pandemic situation.&#13;
&#13;
30. According to the National Plan, during the inter-pandemic period, all suspected cases shall&#13;
be transported to and isolated at the Institute o f Infectious Diseases Prof Dr Matei Bals and- if&#13;
need be- at the Bucharest Victor Babes hospital, where medical assistance shall be provided by&#13;
specialized dedicated personnel. The Prof Matei Bals Institute for Infectious Diseases has about&#13;
360 beds including a special isolation unit (established during the SARS epidemic) and a 50 bed&#13;
Intensive Care Unit-ICU and about 650 staff, including 78 physicians and 265 nurses. The&#13;
hospital has a fully equipped radiological department (including a CT-Scanner) and a fully&#13;
equippedlaboratory which can perform all necessary tests (including RT-PCR and sequencing o f&#13;
virus). While the ICU is well organized, it needs additional equipment, more specifically&#13;
intensive care beds and mechanical ventilators. The centralization o f patient care is part o f the&#13;
MPH strategy to ensure high quality care to suspected or confirmed AI human cases. While this&#13;
strategy i s appropriate in a pre-pandemic period, the MPH needs to start establishing a capacity&#13;
to isolate and treat HPAI patients at the regional level to both reduce the risks linked to the&#13;
transportation o f patients and make sure that all patients can be properly isolated and treated&#13;
within their regions ofresidence.&#13;
&#13;
3 1. The National Plan states that a) at least 50% o f the population with an increased risk should&#13;
be vaccinated with the trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine during the inter-pandemic period,&#13;
which requires the supply o f about 2.5 million vaccine doses and, b) in case o f a pandemic, at&#13;
least 25% o f the total population shall be vaccinated with a univalent vaccine (when available)&#13;
which would implies the supply o f about 5.5 million doses. Inthe past, the Cantacuzino Institute&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 62 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
has produced an average o f 550,000 vaccine doses per year. To be in a position to increase its&#13;
production up to 2.5 million doses while remaining in compliance with good manufacturing&#13;
practice standards, the Cantacuzino Institute needs to upgrade the existing unit and its filling and&#13;
sealing station. A relocation and extension o f the production unit would be needed if the&#13;
production hadto be brought up to 5 million doses or more.&#13;
&#13;
32. The National plan includes provisions regarding the use o f anti-viral drugs for&#13;
chemoprophylaxis and treatment and the stockpiling o f these drugs. The plan indicates that there&#13;
i s a need to stockpile 400,000 and 1million treatment respectively during the inter-pandemic and&#13;
pandemic periods. According to information provided by the MPH, Romania has a currently&#13;
stock pile o f 500,000 oseltamivir (Tamiflu')  treatments.&#13;
&#13;
33. The project will finance:&#13;
&#13;
        (a) The strengthening o f the isolation and case management capacity through (i)the&#13;
             equipment o f the two Bucharest infectious diseases hospitals and, (ii)the&#13;
             establishment o f isolation and intensive care units in 7 o f the regional hospitals for&#13;
             infectious diseases (Brasov, Craiova, Constanta, Cluj, Iasi, Timisoara and Tg. Mures).&#13;
&#13;
        (b) The upgrading and capacity increase o f the influenza vaccine production unit at the&#13;
             Cantacuzino Lnstitute including (i)the rehabilitation and equipment of the influenza&#13;
            production department and, (ii)the completion and equipment o f the filling and&#13;
             sealing unit. This intervention will help both increase the production capacity and&#13;
             ensure that the production i s at the required Good Manufacturing Practice-GMP&#13;
             standards.&#13;
&#13;
Component3 - PUBLIC AWARENESS, COMMUNICATIONS, and&#13;
                     IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT&#13;
&#13;
(A)PublicAwareness and Communications&#13;
&#13;
34.    The Public Awareness and Communications Sub-component will support the GOR's&#13;
efforts indesigning and implementingan integrated and comprehensive communications strategy&#13;
and action plan. The component will be implemented by ANSVSA, and will comprise the&#13;
following three sub-components:&#13;
&#13;
       (i)forStrengthening institutional capacity for ANSVSA: the project will support assistance&#13;
                 and training of communications staff, and additional equipment and operating&#13;
             costs.&#13;
        (ii)Development of an integrated strategy and action planbased on qualitative and&#13;
             quantitative research: the project will build on the experience gained from the&#13;
             information campaigns o f UNDP, UNICEF, USAID, as well as on the sectorial&#13;
             communications strategies o f WHO and UNICEF, and the communications needs&#13;
             assessment o f ANSVSA. The strategy will define parameters o f specific audiences in&#13;
             various generic target groups, the degree o f social acceptance of proposed hygiene&#13;
             and bio-security measures, the associated messages which will need to be persuasive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 63 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             without creating panic, and the most efficient delivery tools and vehicles for a nation&#13;
             wide campaign.&#13;
       (iii)Delivery of several information campaigns: these will aim to obtain the public's&#13;
             support and participation inreporting and monitoring; to promote and induce a set o f&#13;
             behavior changes which will diminish the possibility o f AI outbreaks and&#13;
             contamination; and to educate different key audiences (farmers, people living in&#13;
             villages, traders, local authorities, media, food inspectors, front line workers,&#13;
             consumers, other stakeholders).&#13;
&#13;
35. Project support under this sub-component will focus on information and communication&#13;
activities to increase the attention and commitment o f government, private sector, and civil&#13;
society organizations, and to raise awareness, knowledge and understanding among the general&#13;
population about the risk and potential impact o f the pandemic. It will provide communications&#13;
support to the Avian Influenza response operations across different sectors, at different&#13;
administrative levels, and along different pandemic phases.&#13;
&#13;
36. Advocacy interventions will be needed to maintain and/or create the high-level political&#13;
engagement; a multi-sectorial approach; a credible and trusted public sector response; a&#13;
professional media reporting accurately the AI agenda; and an informed base o f decision-makers,&#13;
supportive o fpolicy implementation and safety-net programs.&#13;
&#13;
37. In addition to the advocacy role, communication programs will bring the public's attention&#13;
to a wide range o f actions stemming from the national response (investments in infrastructure,&#13;
rapid-training for service delivery, allocation o f special financial instruments to compensate and&#13;
mitigate the impact, etc.) This information, together with the activities o f the civic and private&#13;
sectors, will create an "enabling environment," that reduces uncertainty, and builds social-&#13;
support, trust, and understanding of the possible scenarios.&#13;
&#13;
38. To carry out these communication activities, communication specialists and operational&#13;
resources will be assigned to implementation team in ANSVSA to subcontract rapid-research&#13;
around knowledge, attitude and practices o f vulnerable and at-risk populations; to design and&#13;
produce awareness-raising and prevention campaigns; and promote fast reporting through&#13;
innovative technologies. The mobilization o f group resources i s an important element that needs&#13;
to be considered, particularly inpreparation for possible pandemic. Fostering community support&#13;
i s crucial to facilitate transparency in the allocation o f financial incentives, responsiveness in the&#13;
containment and mitigation actions, and adoption o f policies and ordinances that might be&#13;
enforced (culling and banning backyard farming, for example).                    A two-way flow of&#13;
communications, and not only a top-down approach, has to be established, where local interests&#13;
and cultural context are accounted.&#13;
&#13;
39. The communications sub-component will finance technical assistance, training, as well as&#13;
goods and services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  - 64 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(B)ImplementationSupport, Monitoringand Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
40. This sub-component will provide for project coordination and administration, procurement,&#13;
financial management, reporting, monitoring and evaluation activities for all components. The&#13;
project will be implemented by the MPH and ANSVSA, and will build upon the already existing&#13;
Project Management Units in the two agencies. In order to ensure effective implementation o f&#13;
the project in accordance with Bank fiduciary and procurement policies and guidelines, the&#13;
project will finance: (i)Incremental support to the two PMUs in terms o f staff and operating&#13;
costs; (ii)&#13;
          Studies, technical services, manuals; and (iii)  Surveys for monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
The incremental staff will include, for each o f the agencies, one procurement staff, one financial&#13;
management staff and one technical specialist. Funds will also be provided for hiring short-term&#13;
individual consultants and consulting companies for services and surveys on a need basis. The&#13;
project will also provide for purchase o f some additional office equipment and a vehicle,&#13;
together with salaries and operating costs for three years.&#13;

                                               Project&#13;
&#13;
1.    Inline with this overall HPAIemergency structure, the project will becoordinatedby atask&#13;
force within the National Anti-Epizootic Command Center. This task force - operating as the&#13;
Project Steering Committee (PSC) - will consist of representatives o f the Prime Minister's Office&#13;
as the Chair, the MOPF, ANSVSA, and MPH. Given that the task force will consist o f members&#13;
(or their delegates) o f the Anti-Epizootic Command Center, project activities will be fully&#13;
integrated into the overall strategy and national action program to control HPAI. The PSC will&#13;
coordinate and collaborate with other ministries (many o f which are represented in the Anti-&#13;
Epizootic Command Center) affiliated institutions, as well as donors and other international&#13;
partners as needed. Givenits inclusion inthe Anti-Epizootic Command Center, the PSC does not&#13;
need to be formally established. It will, however, meet more regularly, given that the Anti-&#13;
Epizootic Command Center i s only activated in crisis situations. The PSC i s responsible for the&#13;
provision o f broad guidance in project implementation and for ensuring that project activities&#13;
conform to national emergency response strategies and policies. The PSC will review work&#13;
programs including budget and procurement plans, and review and evaluate technical and&#13;
financial monitoring reports. Special attention will be paid to the coordination of the&#13;
communications activities undertaken by MPH and ANSVSA where the representative of the&#13;
Prime Minister will take the lead, with participation and inputs from the two Project&#13;
Coordinators (definition below). The PSC will report to the Prime Minister on a regular basis&#13;
about progress andimpact of project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
2.    The project has selected hybrid implementation arrangements whereby implementation o f&#13;
project activities will be shared betweenvarious national ministries / agencies / institutes as well&#13;
as by two Project Management Units. The project will be implemented jointly by National&#13;
Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety Authority (ANSVSA) and Ministry of Public Health&#13;
(MPH). ANSVSA will designate a senior veterinary official as the coordinator for the Animal&#13;
Health Component and M P H will designate a State Secretary to be in charge o f the Human&#13;
Health Component. Both component coordinators will be responsible for the implementation o f&#13;
their respective components and will jointly share the responsibility o f implementingthe Public&#13;
Awareness and Information Component. The two coordinators will work under the guidance and&#13;
leadership o f the Steering Committee comprised o f representatives o f MPH, ANSVSA, MOPF&#13;
and the Prime Minister's office. The Project Steering Committee and the National Disease and&#13;
Command Center will cooperate and make transparent annual work programming and budgeting&#13;
exercises.&#13;
&#13;
3.    Animal Health Component. This component will be implemented by the ANSVSA, through&#13;
a Project Management Unit (PMU) to be established before effectiveness. Overall coordination&#13;
o f the component will be assured by a senior veterinary official. The Institute for Diagnosis and&#13;
Animal Health and the Institute for Drugs Control will provide technical expertise /&#13;
specifications for their respective activities and will be responsible for smooth implementation o f&#13;
their parts, while overall procurement, financial management and coordination will be done by&#13;
ANSVSA through the PMU.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
4.    Human Health Component. The implementing agency for this component will be MPH,&#13;
through the Project Management Unit (PMU) established to implement the second phase of the&#13;
Health Sector Reform Project. The PMU is well-experienced in assuring that procurement and&#13;
financial management i s carried out in accordance with World Bank guidelines, however&#13;
incremental support in terms o f staff and operating costs will be provided. The activities o f the&#13;
PMU under this component will be under direct oversight o f the component coordinator. The&#13;
"Cantacuzino" Institute and the "Matei Bals" Institute will provide the technical expertise and&#13;
will ensure the technical oversight o f their parts, while overall procurement, financial&#13;
management and coordination will e done by the MPH, through the PMU.&#13;
&#13;
5.    Public Awareness and Communications Component. This component will be implemented&#13;
jointly by ANSVSA. Inparticular, there will be ajoint communications strategy and action plan,&#13;
and the information campaigns will be coordinated in terms o f timing, design, messages,&#13;
distribution channels and targeted audiences.&#13;
&#13;
6.    A Project Implementation Manual will be developed prior to effectiveness, which will&#13;
describe in greater details roles and responsibilities, chain o f command and decision making&#13;
process, procurement plan andTerms of Reference for the first year, etc.&#13;
&#13;
7.    Details o f the institutional arrangements, coordination mechanisms, and decision-making&#13;
processes, as well as monitoring and evaluation, will be described by the Borrower in a Project&#13;
Implementation Manual (PIM) satisfactory to the Bank. The PIM will include a description o f&#13;
these structures and processes, as well as the procurement plans, detailed cost tables,&#13;
environmental management plan (EMP), forms for budgetingand financial reporting, monitoring&#13;
methodology and forms, terms o f reference for key positions o f project management and&#13;
technical assistance, and annotated outlines o f envisaged training activities.&#13;

&#13;
Preamble&#13;
&#13;
1.    As described in OP 8.50 for Emergency Recovery Assistance (ERA), in addition to&#13;
emergency assistance, the Bank may support operations for prevention and mitigation in&#13;
countries prone to specific types o f emergencies. Such operations could assist in: (a) developing&#13;
a national strategy, (b) establishing an adequate institutional and regulatory framework, (c)&#13;
carrying out studies o f vulnerability and risk assessment, (d) reinforcing vulnerable structures,&#13;
and (e) acquiring hazard-reduction technology.&#13;
&#13;
A. General&#13;
&#13;
2.    Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated M a y 2004, and&#13;
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated M a y&#13;
2004, and with the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. Agreements covering&#13;
procurement methods, thresholds, and other conditionality will be consistent with ERA&#13;
assistance guidelines and determined for the Project according to capacity and experience o f&#13;
implementing agencies in procurement and taking into account the emergency nature o f the&#13;
operation.&#13;
&#13;
3.    The activities covered under the Project will be implemented on the basis o f annual work&#13;
plans to allow for needed flexibility in adjusting activities to account for in-country experience&#13;
and the lessons from implementation by other countries participating inthe multi-country Global&#13;
Program for Avian Influenza and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response GPAI.&#13;
Accordingly, the following approach to procurement will be adopted.&#13;
&#13;
B. Procurementarrangements&#13;
&#13;
4.    Procurement Capacity Assessment. Procurement activities for Animal Health Component&#13;
will be carried out by the National Authority for Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety&#13;
(ANSVSA), through the PMU o f the M A K I S Project, and for Human Health Components the&#13;
Health APL2 Project PMU under the Ministry o f Public Health. Procurement under the Public&#13;
Awareness and Communications Component will be conducted by both PMUs in close&#13;
coordination. The Bank has carried out. procurement capacity assessments o f the two&#13;
implementing agencies which will be responsible for fiduciary tasks including procurement,&#13;
financial management, and disbursements and has found them to be satisfactory. Staff&#13;
knowledgeable o f applicable Bank procedures and guidelines i s already available in both&#13;
institutions but need reinforcement in order to cope with the incremental work load from this&#13;
additional project. Given the emergency nature o f the operation it i s crucial that fiduciary tasks,&#13;
including procurement, are entrusted to experienced staff who require minimal familiarization&#13;
with applicable policies and procedures. To achieve this, and taking into account that both the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 69 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
M A K I S Project and the Health APL2 Project are currently at the initial phase o f implementation,&#13;
the following measures have been agreed:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Experienced short-term consultants will be recruited, financed from the respective&#13;
        projects, to start the preparation o f the required procurement documents for the first year&#13;
        o f implementation o f the avian influenza project;&#13;
&#13;
    0   The two project implementing agencies will recruit one experienced procurement staff&#13;
        each to assist the PMUs with the incremental procurement work load stemmingfrom this&#13;
        additional project.&#13;
&#13;
        The necessary level o f authority should be delegated to the implementation teams to&#13;
        ensure streamlined procedures related to contract preparation and implementation. This&#13;
        may include delegation o f required authority to sign the contracts based on the annual&#13;
        plans approvedby the respective Romanian authority and the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
        The implementation o f the project will be intensively and closely supervised with the&#13;
        ratio o f one out o f five contracts to be post reviewed.&#13;
&#13;
        All complaints bybidders will be diligently addressed and monitored inconsultation with&#13;
        the Bank&#13;
&#13;
        All tender notices and information on contract awards will be published as per Bank&#13;
        Procurement Guidelines&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.   Taking into account the current uncertainties about the scope and implementation&#13;
arrangements, given the country conditions, the Project has been classified in category highrisk.&#13;
The annual Procurement Plan (PP) will define thresholds for prior review appropriate to this&#13;
category; these thresholds will be reviewed during supervision mission and adjusted to minimize&#13;
prior review as appropriate to the level o f risk.&#13;
&#13;
6.   Procurement Methods and Thresholds. The Loan Agreement and the Procurement Plan&#13;
define the appropriate methods and thresholds for International Competitive Bidding (ICB),&#13;
National Competitive Bidding (NCB),             or Shopping in accordance with ERA guidelines.&#13;
Thresholds for project procurement methods and prior review requirements have been indicated&#13;
on the basis o f the Bank's latest assessment o f the capacity o f the implementingentities involved&#13;
which will be responsible for procurement, the estimated risks specific to the country, and the&#13;
country's capacity o f construction, manufacturing and consulting.&#13;

11. UNAgencies as Procurement Agents. For several years, a number o f specialized UNand&#13;
bilateral agencies operating in the Region have supported various country agencies in the&#13;
procurement of drugs, vaccines, specialized test equipment and supplies, and other materials.&#13;
Using this type o f assistance will be part o f the Project's procurement arrangements. In&#13;
accordance with the Procurement Guidelines Section 3.9, the Project will include the use o f&#13;
Specialized Agencies o f the United Nations (WHO, FA0 and UNICEF) as suppliers o f goods&#13;
(mainly for drugs and vaccines and some medical supplies such as reagents), following their own&#13;
procedures ofprocurement.&#13;
&#13;
12. Procurement under Emergency Assistance Provisions. Following ERA procedures, the&#13;
Project i s likely to include financing for items included on a positive list of imports identified as&#13;
necessary under a well-defined preparedness and response program to be prepared as part o f&#13;
project implementation. In case o f a declared global influenza pandemic, which will trigger&#13;
disbursement conditions for critical imports, support will be provided under the Project for the&#13;
procurement o f a positive list o f critical imports. These may be procured under Modified&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (MICB), according to paragraphs 2.66 and 2.67 o f the&#13;
Procurement Guidelines. Also, commonly traded commodities may be procured through&#13;

1. Summary&#13;
&#13;
1.   Country Issues. The first Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for&#13;
Romania was finalized in December 2003 and concluded that the overall fiduciary risk&#13;
associated with the public financial management and financial accountability arrangements o f&#13;
the Romanian government administration i s considered to be moderate, with the systems for&#13;
accounting, financial reporting and internal control representing the areas with the higher risks&#13;
and budgeting, cash management and external audit and Parliamentary oversight representingthe&#13;
lower risks. The implications o f the CFAA for the project have been addressed by the following&#13;
actions:&#13;
       o A detailedreview o f the systems was performed for the implementingentities;&#13;
       o The implementing entities will set up distinct project-specific accounting ledgers;&#13;
       o   Project accounting staff appointed by the implementing entities;&#13;
       o   The format o f the IFRs and audit TORSagreed with the implementingentities;&#13;
       o   Project financial statements audited by an independent auditor annually.&#13;
&#13;
2.   In line with the EC's recent Comprehensive Monitoring Report, dated October 25, 2005,&#13;
which reveals that corruption in Romania remains a serious and widespread problem, the&#13;
corruption risk for this project i s considered significant and relates to procurement, also&#13;
considering the emergency nature o f the operation, and to the safeguarding o f the project assets.&#13;
The project will address the governance and implementation challenges they pose in a systematic&#13;
manner, actively promoting greater transparency, accountability and integrity through smart&#13;
project design and implementation arrangements. These mitigation actions can be summarized as&#13;
follows: (a) the project will establish a tight internal control framework, including appropriate&#13;
internal control over the management and safeguarding o f project assets, in particular the high&#13;
value goods, equipment and vaccines; (b) the size o f procurement packages and the frequency o f&#13;
the Bank's prior review will be determined in a way that it allows an appropriate level o f control&#13;
while attempting to avoid unnecessary reviews which could cause delays; (c) the project will&#13;
increase its reliance on internal audit departments as these continue to develop, (d) the project&#13;
will also seek operational reviews by the Court o f Accounts or independent auditors on terms&#13;
acceptable to the Bank; (e) enhanced disclosure and transparency o f project-related information,&#13;
including through a project website; and (f) an appropriate complaints handling mechanism. All&#13;
complaints from bidders, observers or other parties should be promptly forwarded to the&#13;
Government and the Bank for consideration and follow-up action.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

3.    Risk Assessment and Mitigation Measures. The overall financial management risk for the&#13;
project is moderate, and adequate mitigation measures are inplace to ensure that the residual risk&#13;
i s acceptable. The table below summarizes the financial management assessment and risk&#13;
ratings.&#13;

&#13;
4.    Strengths and Weaknesses. The significant strengths that provide a basis o f reliance on the&#13;
project financial management system include the simple funds' flow and project financial&#13;
management teams experienced in the implementation o f other WB financed projects. There are&#13;
no significant weaknesses o f the project financial management system.&#13;
&#13;
5.    Implementing Entities. The project management units, one existing within the Ministry o f&#13;
Public Health (MPH) - in charge of the implementation o f the Health APL 2 Project (P078971)&#13;
and the other one to be established within the ANSVSA - in charge of the implementation o f the&#13;
relevant components o f the M A K I S Project (P086949) will be responsible for the financial&#13;
management aspects o f the new Project.&#13;
&#13;
6.    Funds Flow. Project funds will flow in respect o f each o f the sources o f project financing&#13;
as follows:&#13;
&#13;
       (i)MPH&#13;
            The Bank loan, by direct payments or via the Designated Accounts (DAs), one for&#13;
                   and one for ANSVSA, which will be replenished on transactional methods&#13;
            usingStatements o fExpenditure; and&#13;
       (ii)Governmentcounterpartcontribution,viadedicatedTreasuryprojectaccounts.&#13;
&#13;
 7.   Two designated accounts will be opened at commercial banks on terms and conditions&#13;
acceptable to the WB. Foreign currency amounts will be exchanged as needed in local currency&#13;
(RON), to cover eligible expenditures payments in local currency to suppliers, from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 75 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
designated accounts into local currency transfer accounts that will be opened at commercial&#13;
banks on terms and conditions acceptable to the WB.&#13;
&#13;
8.    Government counterpart contribution payments will be made from separate Treasury&#13;
project accounts, which will be used specifically for the counterpart contributions to the project.&#13;
These contributions will be receivedmonthly inaccordance with standard budgetprocedures.&#13;
&#13;
9.    Staffing. The project management unit within MPH includes a finance team comprising a&#13;
financial coordinator and an accountant. The unit within ANSVSA includes a financial officer.&#13;
The project finance teams will work closely with the existing MPH's and ANSVSA's economic,&#13;
finance and accounting departments. The project financial staff will be employees o f M P H and&#13;
ANSVSA, respectively. The project financial management functions may be supplemented with&#13;
additional experts as needed duringimplementation.&#13;
&#13;
10. Accounting Policies and Procedures. The project's accounting books and records will be&#13;
maintained on an accrual basis and denominated in Romanian Lei (RON) with the exception o f&#13;
the books and records in the DAs which will be maintained in the currency o f the Bank loan.&#13;
The project units will build upon the existing accounting procedures and internal control&#13;
framework to ensure that all project procedures and controls are adequately documented,&#13;
contract monitoring and invoice payment procedures are consistently adhered to and&#13;
documented. Before signing the contracts (especially for the acquisition o f higher risk items,&#13;
such as drugs, vaccines, etc), the project units will verify and compare unit prices obtained with&#13;
those available on the local and international market, usingthe Internet or similar. Then, for each&#13;
contract, a monitoring sheet will be opened, filled in and updated by each implementing entity,&#13;
as follows: (i)  date o f the contract; (ii)&#13;
                                           number o f the contract; (iii) o f the contractor; (iv)&#13;
                                                                          name&#13;
contract start date; (v) contract end date; (vi) name o f the assigned resident inspector for works&#13;
or recipient for goods or services, where relevant; (vii) name o f the assigned contract monitoring&#13;
staff within the project team; (viii) contract value; (ix) list o f invoices received for the contract;&#13;
(x) amounts paid in respect o f the contract; (xi) date o f the last inspection, where relevant; and&#13;
(xii) record o fprocurement complaints.&#13;
&#13;
11. For each payment, the following standard checklist will be filled inprior to the payment o f&#13;
any invoice to ensure that all appropriate contract monitoring procedures have beencarried out,&#13;
confirming: (i)that the invoice was accompanied by an appropriate certified completion&#13;
certificate by the assigned resident inspector or other goods received note or acknowledgement&#13;
o f receipt o f the goods or services; (ii)the mathematical accuracy o f the invoice; (iii) the&#13;
                                                                                              that&#13;
invoice agrees to the terms o f payment as specified in the contract; (iv) that the works described&#13;
in the invoice and resident inspector's report are those contracted for; (v) the approval by the&#13;
relevant staff member; (vi) the approval by the project manager; (vii) the date o f payment o f the&#13;
invoice; and (viii) that the contract monitoring sheet has been updated.&#13;
&#13;
12. The other procedures that will be performed include:&#13;
&#13;
       o   Close monthly project accounting books no later than the 15th o f the following month;&#13;
&#13;
       o   Close yearly project accounting books no later than January 31st o fthe following year;&#13;
       o Check the mathematical accuracy o fthe IFRs inputswith the accounting records;&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                                - 76 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       o  Check the opening figures o f the IFRswith the closing figures o f the previousquarter;&#13;
&#13;
       o  Check the IFRs figures for consistency between the various reports (Statement o f&#13;
          Sources and Uses o f Funds, Uses o f Funds by Project Activities, Designated Account&#13;
          Statements,    Physical    Progress  Reports,   Procurement, Reports      and Contract&#13;
          Monitoring);&#13;
       o Monthly bank accounts statements reconciliation with project accounting records;&#13;
&#13;
       o  MonthlyBank disbursement recordsreconciliation with project accountingbooks; and&#13;
&#13;
       o  Inventory and fixed assets stock taking at least once per year and more often, if&#13;
          needed.&#13;
&#13;
13. Additional internal control measures for the project will be developed to ensure the&#13;
appropriate management and safeguarding of high value goods, equipment drugs, vaccines, etc.&#13;
Currently, only very few assets, goods and equipment are covered by adequate insurance&#13;
policies. The project - financing high value goods, equipment and vaccines - will have adequate&#13;
insurance coverage against theft and damage. The vaccines will be stored and transported in safe&#13;
conditions including refrigeration where needed, proper security, monitoring o f the shelf life, etc.&#13;
Regular deliveries o f goods will be received at the warehouses used under the project, inorder to&#13;
ensure the needed level o f supply. The contracts with the suppliers will stipulate the schedule o f&#13;
deliveries on a monthly basis, considering the needs o f usage and the storage capacity o f the&#13;
warehouses. Deliveries will have purchase orders that are matched to the goods inwards notes,&#13;
certified by the warehouse officers and verified by the project management unit representatives.&#13;
Goods delivery notes signed by an authorized recipient will be matched to supply orders by the&#13;
project units. The warehouses will communicate monthly the inventory status to the project units&#13;
and the project units will often perform on the spot checks.&#13;
&#13;
14. Other additional internal controls will be developed for the following areas:&#13;
       (i)Authorization    and proper accounting for the movement o f higher risk items, such as&#13;
            drugs, between warehouses, decentralized locations (hospitals, municipalities or&#13;
            centers) and final users; and&#13;
       (ii)Decentralizedlocations(hospitals, municipalitiesorcenters) consideredwillneedto&#13;
            have proper control procedures, including cool storing facilities where needed,&#13;
            accounting for the receipts and uses o f the drugs, and safeguarding procedures,&#13;
            including authorization for movements and uses.&#13;
&#13;
15. The existing arrangements in place for vaccine management and storage within the&#13;
proposed entities inBucharest and the seven regional satisfy the minimum financial management&#13;
requirements and include restricted access control to the storage areas, computerized inventory&#13;
management systems and controls over the movements and uses. The MoH county health&#13;
departments will be responsible for ensuring the transportation o f vaccines between the locations&#13;
in proper conditions, having been previously equipped, through another WB financed project,&#13;
with appropriate transportation means, including refrigeration, etc. Additional internal controls&#13;
will include strengthening security arrangements for storage facilities within the proposed&#13;
entities, as well as during the transportation to the regional centers and increase o f adequate&#13;
storage capacity for the proposed regional centers, as needed. These measures will be developed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 77 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
as part o f crisis action plan. The additional procedures mentioned above will ensure that the&#13;
project establishes a tight internal control framework, including appropriate internal controls&#13;
over the management o f vaccines.&#13;
&#13;
16. The Project Implementation Manual will include the full accounting and internal control&#13;
procedures.&#13;
&#13;
2. Audit Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
17. Internal Audit. Both MPH and ANSVSA include in their structure an internal audit&#13;
department.    It is anticipated that these internal audit departments will review the project's&#13;
financial management arrangements, including higher risk items such as drugs, vaccines, etc -&#13;
checking internal controls and inventories. The internal audit departments will include in their&#13;
annual work program the Project, as part o f MPH's and ANSVSA's overall activities. As the&#13;
internal audit departments continue to develop, the project will rely to the extent possible on it&#13;
for the project internal audit.&#13;
&#13;
18. External Audit. As o f the date o f this report, the M P H and ANSVSA are in compliance&#13;
with the audit covenants o f existingBank-financedprojects.&#13;
&#13;
19. The Project will be audited annually both by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank&#13;
and on terms o f reference acceptable to the Bank. The terms o f reference for the audit will be&#13;
agreed upon and attached to the minutes o f negotiations. The audit scope will include the&#13;
project's books and records as maintained by the implementing entities, all withdrawal&#13;
applications, and the designated accounts. The audited project financial statements together with&#13;
the auditor's opinion thereon will be provided to the Bank within six months of the end o f the&#13;
reporting period, being the fiscal year. The project management unit within MPHwill coordinate&#13;
the auditing arrangements and will sign the contracts with the auditors for the entire project.&#13;
&#13;
20. In addition, the Romanian Court o f Accounts (CoA), the country's supreme audit&#13;
institution, will continue to perform ad hoc external audits o f the implementing entities,&#13;
including o f this project. The CoA will perform an operational review o f the project to look at&#13;
the specific issues related to governance, efficiency and performance. Currently the CoA&#13;
performs the audit field work at the ANSVSA and MPH in respect o f the year ended December&#13;
31, 2005 and will issue the report by October 31, 2006. The following chart identifies the audit&#13;
reports that will be required to be submitted by the project implementation agencies together&#13;
with the due date for submission.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
  3. DisbursementArrangements&#13;
&#13;
  21. Bank funds will be disbursed either as direct payments, or to the two Designated Accounts&#13;
  (DAs) which will be replenished under the transactional disbursement procedures. Withdrawal&#13;
  applications for the replenishments o f the DAs will be sent to the Bank monthly, or when about a&#13;
  third o f the initial deposit in the DAs has been utilized, whichever comes first. All&#13;
  replenishments for transactions above the prior-review threshold will be fully documented.&#13;
  Supporting documentation for all transactions, including completion reports, goods received&#13;
  notes and acceptance certificates, will be retained by the implementing entities and made&#13;
  available to the Bank during project supervision. There i s no plan to move to forecast report-&#13;
  based periodic disbursements.&#13;
&#13;
  4. ReportingandMonitoring&#13;
&#13;
  22. Project management-oriented Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) will be used for project&#13;
  monitoring and supervision. The PMUwithin MPH will aggregate the project's IFRs on a semi-&#13;
  annual basis with inputs received from ANSVSA's PMU, and the reports will be submitted to the&#13;
  Bank within 45 days after the semester end. The format for IFRs has been developed and was&#13;
  agreed upon and attached to the minutes o f negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
  5. InformationSystems&#13;
&#13;
  23. Both MPH and ANSVSA project units have in place existing financial management,&#13;
  accounting and reporting software systems. Project specific ledgers will be created within the&#13;
  systems to allow the project units to record distinctly the operations o f the new project using the&#13;
&#13;
' existing chart o f accounts.&#13;

  7. SupervisionPlan&#13;
&#13;
  25. Duringproject implementation, the Bank will supervise the project's financial management&#13;
  arrangements in two main ways: (i)     review the project's quarterly interim financial reports as&#13;
  well as the project's annual audited financial statements and auditor's management letter; and (ii)&#13;
  during the Bank's supervision missions, review the project's financial management and&#13;
  disbursement arrangements (including a review o f a sample o f withdrawal applications and&#13;
  movements on the designated accounts) to ensure compliance with the Bank's financial&#13;
  management requirements.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
1.    The Romanian Avian Influenza Project has been assigned World Bank environmental&#13;
category B, since it involves moderate environmental impacts that can be mitigated during&#13;
implementation o f the project. Although project activities supporting AI prevention,&#13;
preparedness and planning, response and containment are not expected to generate significant&#13;
adverse environmental effects, they do present a moderate environmental risk from inadvertent&#13;
spread o f the AI virus and waste management. Overall the AI prevention and response-focused&#13;
activities are expected to have a positive environmental impact, as the investments in facilities,&#13;
equipment, and training for veterinary and public health service staff and laboratories will&#13;
improve the effectiveness and safety over existing avian influenza handling and testing&#13;
procedures by meeting international standards established by OIE and WHO. This will be&#13;
reinforced by the mainstreaming o f environmental safeguards into protocols and procedures for&#13;
the culling and disposal o f animals during AI outbreaks and for laboratory and medical facility&#13;
waste management and bio-safety, andvaccine production.&#13;
&#13;
2.    This environmental management plan (EMP) will address the moderate adverse&#13;
environmental effects o f the Animal and Human Health Components. For the Animal&#13;
component, the EMP will address zoonotic disease containment and waste management as it&#13;
pertains to disposal o f special waste, emissions and materials at laboratories, and training for&#13;
veterinary services workers, to include procedures for safe handling o f AI materials, safe culling&#13;
o f infected and at-risk poultry and disposal o f carcasses. For the Human Health component, the&#13;
EMP will focus on equipment, refurbishing and training for laboratories and medical facilities to&#13;
include key environmental issues in zoonotic disease containment and waste management. The&#13;
Human Health component will also finance the expansion o f vaccine production capacity at the&#13;
Cantacuzino Institute in Bucharest, from an average o f 550,000 vaccine doses per year to 2.5&#13;
million doses. The EMPwill provide mitigation plans and monitoring plans to ensure appropriate&#13;
attention to environmental issues, and tracking progress or problems in their management. A&#13;
delay in the completion and disclosure o f the Environmental Assessment from the normal&#13;
appraisal stage has been approved, instead making this a condition o f disbursement for goods&#13;
and works under Component 1- Animal Health, and Component 2 - Human Health.&#13;
&#13;
3.     The main areas o f environmental risk from project activities are the inadvertent spread o f&#13;
the AI virus during culling, transport and disposal o f carcasses, animal waste, litter, and used&#13;
protective gear; contamination o f surface and groundwater from use o f disinfectants; laboratory&#13;
bio-safety and waste management; and pharmaceutical manufacturing waste management. In&#13;
addition, minor environmental disturbances may occur during renovation o f laboratories.&#13;
&#13;
4.     Animal Health: Equipment, refurbishing and training for regional laboratories and border&#13;
inspection to include key environmental issues in zoonotic disease containment and waste&#13;
management as pertain to special waste, emissions and materials; training for veterinary services&#13;
and poultry sector workers to include procedures for safe handling o f AI materials; safe culling&#13;
o f infected and at-risk poultry and disposal o f carcasses.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
7.    Since October 2005, Romania experienced some 180 HPAI outbreaks in commercial and&#13;
backyard poultry farms, requiring massive control activities including culling, disinfection,&#13;
quarantining, and compensation, as well as preventivemedication with anti-viral drugs. The cost&#13;
o f controlling the disease in addition to the economic losses experienced by farmers and up- and&#13;
downstream producers and related industries including tourism have been estimated to exceed&#13;
E m 9 0 million. Given that Romania actually experienced HPAI outbreaks, the economic&#13;
analysis will begin with a presentation of actual costs and economic losses that occurred during&#13;
the first two waves o f HPAIoutbreaks (Part I). on this analysis o f actual costs, Part I1will&#13;

Public administration:&#13;
&#13;
8.    Since October 2005, Romanian authorities engaged in massive control activities to contain&#13;
and eradicate the HPAI virus. The following key institutions were involved: (1) National&#13;
Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety Authority management o f the AI outbreaks in animals,&#13;
                                                    -&#13;
using both its regulatory and enforcement powers; (2) Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and&#13;
Rural Development - payment o f compensations to poultry holders; (3) Ministry o f Public&#13;
Health - implementation of preventive measures and surveillance o f people; (4) Ministry o f&#13;
Transport, Construction and Tourism - set up o f disinfection points on the roads; (5) Ministry o f&#13;
Education and Research - participation in information and communication campaigns; and (6)&#13;
Ministryo fAdministration andInterior-display oftask forces inthe AIoutbreaks.&#13;
&#13;
9.    Between October 2005 and June 2006, the National Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety&#13;
Authority spent EUR 5.7 million (around 2.5% of its total expenditure) on disinfectants, culling&#13;
and incineration o f poultry, specialized equipment etc. 51% o f the total expenditure was made in&#13;
the last trimester o f 2005, while the rest inthe first half o f 2006. Inthe same period o f time, the&#13;
MinistryofAgriculture, Forestry and Rural Development spent EUR3.9 million (less than 0.5%&#13;
o f its total expenditure) on the compensations to poultry holders. Only 18% o f its total AI&#13;
expenditure occurred in 2005, while most o f the compensations were paid in2006. The Ministry&#13;
o f Transport, Construction and Tourism spent EUR 45.2 million (with the proportion o f its total&#13;
expenditure increasing from 0.2 in 2005 to 2.75 in 2006) on road and railway disinfection. The&#13;
Ministryo fPublicHealthspent EUR 1.3 million (less than 0.2% o fits total expenditure) both on&#13;
vaccination (80% o f the total AI expenditure) and on sanitary and protection equipment, printed&#13;
information materials etc. This expenditure does not include the costs related to family doctors,&#13;
whose activity was supported by the National Health Insurance House. About EUR 0.2 million&#13;
were spent on preventive medication with anti-viral drugs (Tamiflu"). The Ministry o f&#13;
Administration and Interior stated only marginal expenses related to AI in the amount o f EUR&#13;
15,700. This money was spent for vaccinating against seasonal influenza the security forces that&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
entered the outbreak areas. The Ministry o f Education and Research stated no specific&#13;
expenditure related to AI, as no extra activities were caused by the bird disease (the AI was&#13;
imposed as a compulsory topic for the regular civic education classes).&#13;
&#13;
Domesticpoultry consumption:&#13;
&#13;
10. The Romanian domestic consumers o f poultry meat responded quickly and dramatically to&#13;
the AI crisis. The second wave o f influenza was accompanied by an unprecedented reduction in&#13;
demand, o f about 8O%, as opposed to a drop o f about 40% inthe last quarter o f 2005. However,&#13;
the duration o f the low poultry consumption rates that followed the re-eruption o f the AI i s&#13;
difficult to estimate.&#13;
&#13;
Domesticpoultryproduction:&#13;
&#13;
11. Duringthe first AI wave, 421,470 birds were destroyed in 16,166 households, while during&#13;
the second AI wave, the number of poultry culled went up to 210,470 (in 14,255 households) and&#13;
to 764,865 (incommercial farms).&#13;
&#13;
12. Commercial farms. According to the Romanian Association o f Poultry Producers, the&#13;
sectoral losses incurred because o f the AI went up to about EUR 70 million from October 2005&#13;
to the end o f M a y 2006. They were equally distributedbetween the last quarter o f 2005 and the&#13;
first half o f 2006, while about EUR 20 million of the current year's loss relate to the second&#13;
wave o f the bird disease (May 2006). Several factors lie behind the damages claimed: (i)&#13;
depressed prices, (ii) ban, (iii) o f one-day chickens whose sales were prohibited,&#13;
                       export          culling&#13;
(iv) delays in the production flows caused by shortages inthe storage places for meat and eggs,&#13;
(v) inventory increases, (vi) difficulties in selling hatching eggs but also (vii) additional&#13;
disinfection costs.&#13;
&#13;
 13. Backyard farms. There are no estimates o f the losses suffered by the backyard poultry&#13;
producers. However, the compensations promptly paid by the Ministry o f Agriculture, Forestry&#13;
and Rural Development were largely judged as having covered the economic value o f the poultry&#13;
slaughtered. However, for both types o f poultry producers (commercial and backyard) there are&#13;
additional costs associated with the opportunities lost because o f interrupting production untilthe&#13;
outbreak area was formerly closed. An approximation relying on the average poultry meat and&#13;
egg output for the six weeks when the outbreak i s under surveillance would lead to losses o f&#13;
about EUR 1.5 million incurred by the poultry producers between October 2005 and M a y 2006.&#13;
&#13;
Foreigntrade:&#13;
&#13;
 14.    In2005, Romania imported 158,000 tons o fpoultry meat, the equivalent o f about 0.70 of&#13;
the domestic commercial production. However, in the first half o f 2006 the import/domestic&#13;
production ratio worsened for Romania, reaching 0.86, while imports totaled 53,000 tons. Import&#13;
protection was consequently granted to the Romanian poultry producers, as a temporary increase&#13;
intariff (from 45% to 70%) for two tariff lines corresponding to about 70% of the total poultry&#13;
meat imports. Overall, given the very small share o f the poultry meat exports in the total&#13;
domestic production (less than 2% in 2005), the restrictions on the Romanian poultry products&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 83 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
caused relatively little sectoral losses when compared to other factors. For instance, according to&#13;
the GAIN Report - R06004, the export bans, in conjunction with slaughter delays and slaughter&#13;
disinfection, generated 22% of the total loss suffered by the Romanian poultry sector in the last&#13;
trimester o f 2005.&#13;
&#13;
Pricesinthe poultryindustry:&#13;
&#13;
15. According to the National Institute o f Statistics, the prices in the poultry industry dropped&#13;
inMay 2006 as compared to the previous month: by 10.4 percentage points for eggs and by 1.1&#13;
percentage points for poultry meat. This monthly development continues the downward trend&#13;
that was already recorded inthe poultry industry during 2005 (a fall by 11.7 percentage points in&#13;
the poultry meat prices, according to the National Bank o f Romania). However, apart from the&#13;
reduction in the domestic demand caused by the eruption o f AI, there i s also pressure on the&#13;
domestic poultry producers stemming from ever cheaper imports. Between 2000 and 2005,&#13;
poultry import prices fell from 1,000-1,200 USD/ton to 550-600 USD/ton. Moreover the&#13;
Romanian producers complain about unfair competition from U S and Brazilian suppliers, who&#13;
are not obliged to observe the EUstandards for selling their products on the Romanianmarket.&#13;
&#13;
Relatedindustries:&#13;
&#13;
16. The full utilization o f the poultry meat storage capacities leads to the blockage o f the&#13;
slaughter-houses and o f the entire upstream industry. According to the Romanian Association o f&#13;
Poultry Producers, the extra storage costs caused by the AI contributed by about 18% to the total&#13;
poultry industry loss during the last quarter o f 2005 (i.e. EUR 35 million). Moreover, the&#13;
financial difficulties that affect the poultry producers may impact also on the suppliers o f both&#13;
animal feed and disinfectants. However, in an initial phase, there was an increased demand for&#13;
disinfectants, going up to about EUR4.6 millionbetween October and December 2005.&#13;
&#13;
17. Substitute industries. The reduction in the poultry meat consumption caused by the AI has&#13;
lead to rather limited gains in the other meat industries. According to the Romanian Meat&#13;
Association, there was an insignificant increase inthe red meat sales (2%) starting May 2006, far&#13;
below the drop inthe poultry sector.&#13;
&#13;
18. Banking system. According to the National Bank o f Romania, 63 poultry producers&#13;
contracted bank loans going up to almost EUR 81 million (14% o f the net banking profits in&#13;
2005). Banks are consequently exposed to the risk o f non-payment ifthe poultry sector continues&#13;
to face difficulties inrecovering.&#13;
&#13;
19. Tourism. The Federation o f the Employers in the Romanian Tourism estimates that the&#13;
sectoral losses caused by the AI i s inthe amount o f about EUR 50 million from October 2005 to&#13;
March 2006 alone (according to the statistics available in the industry). These losses cover only&#13;
accommodation and meals and do not include any other expenses that could have been made by&#13;
the tourists. The general perspective i s that tourism will be affected throughout 2006, even if the&#13;
AIis eradicated.&#13;

Part I1 Economic Analysis of Future Project Activities&#13;
          -&#13;
&#13;
20. From October 2005 to May 2006, two waves o f AI have lead to the culling o f about 1.4%&#13;
o f the total 2005 poultry population in Romania and to significant economic losses reaching an&#13;
estimated amount o f at least EUR 193 million (according to a conservative estimate, see table 2&#13;
above). Economic benefits of investments under the project have been estimated through a&#13;
costbenefit analysis comparing the incremental stream o f estimated net benefits "with project" to&#13;
those "without project". Recognizing that the project supports investments that are targeted at&#13;
two different scenarios that could only be combined through the (rather arbitrary) assumption o f&#13;
the probability o f the case of a (human) influenza pandemic, two separate models have been&#13;
formulated: (i) Influenza as zoonosis, causing widespread damage to the poultry industry&#13;
                   Avian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         - 85 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
but only very few (if at all any) human infections and deaths; (ii)           Pandemic phase with&#13;
widespread human illness and death.&#13;
&#13;
(i) Avian Influenza as zoonosis, causingwidespreaddamageto the poultryindustrybut&#13;
    only very few (if at all any) human infectionsand deaths.&#13;
&#13;
21. Economic benefits are estimated based on the project's objective to reduce economic cost&#13;
related to poultry deaths from H P A I due to the disease itself or through culling. The "without&#13;
project" scenario i s based on estimates derived from the economic losses experienced during the&#13;
actual outbreaks between October 2005 and July 2006 and a reference HPAI incidence rate o f&#13;
1.4%. The successful implementation o f the project is expected to contribute to the reduction o f&#13;
the incidence inculling rates and hence reduction inthe costs to the economy. Inorder to achieve&#13;
a reference internal rate o f return o f 12% for the project's investments, a reduction in the H P A I&#13;
incidence rate by about 10% in the first two project years, and another 5% annually in year 3,&#13;
totaling about 30% at the end o f the project implementation period (Le., after three years), would&#13;
be required. That means, the project is worth to be undertaken if improvements in the&#13;
effectiveness o f the response o f veterinary services (detection, containment, eradication) and&#13;
poultry producers (bio-security and early warning) to HPAI outbreaks lead to a reduction in the&#13;
number o fkilled (by the disease) and/or culled birds from 1.41% o fthe total number o f domestic&#13;
birds in Romania (actual, without project) to 0.98% with the project. These calculations have&#13;
beenmade usinga time horizon o f eight years. However, even ifHPAIdisappears after a number&#13;
o f years, investments supported under the project will increase the capacity o f veterinary and&#13;
public health services to respond more effectively to other transboundary and zoonotic diseases&#13;
as well. Assuming the standard time horizon for economic analysis o f 20 years, a reduction inthe&#13;
HPAIincidence rate by only 5% annually over the first three years (the project implementation&#13;
years) would be required, equivalent to a reduction in the culling rate from 1.41% without the&#13;
project to 1.13% with the project.&#13;
&#13;
(ii) Pandemicphasewith widespreadhumanillnessand death&#13;
&#13;
22. Regarding a possible pandemic situation some modeling has been done, although the results&#13;
o f such modeling are to be read with a great level o f uncertainty. Since many characteristics of a&#13;
next pandemic viral strain remain unknown, modeling methods and parameter estimates mostly&#13;
underestimate intervention-related benefits, thus yielding minimum estimates o f the true cost-&#13;
benefit ratios. Literature on pandemic modeling shows however that even under the most&#13;
unfavorable assumptions, pre-pandemic stockpiling remains cost-saving as long as the estimated&#13;
probability o f a pandemic remained &gt;1 every 80 years. The advantage to either therapeutic or&#13;
short-term prophylactic use o f antiviral drugs appears to be limited.&#13;
&#13;
23. Vaccination represents the single most cost-effective strategy to avert influenza-related&#13;
morbidity, mortality and economic consequences. The main drivers o f the pharmacoeconomic&#13;
profile o f elderly influenza vaccination are the vaccine effectiveness in terms o f prevention o f&#13;
hospitalization and mortality, the background incidence o f hospitalization and death in&#13;
unvaccinated individuals and the relative costing o f the vaccine compared with the costs o f a&#13;
hospital in-patient day. The variation in outcomes between different studies can partly be&#13;
explained by differences in these main drivers. This review demonstrates that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 86 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
pharmacoeconomic profile o f elderly influenza vaccination i s highly favorable. From the studies&#13;
it appears that financial benefits o f elderly influenza vaccination surpass the costs and that, when&#13;
this is not the case, cost-effectiveness interms o fnet costs per life-year gained is acceptable.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
25. The vaccination policy in Romania in view o f the pandemic threat i s under discussion.&#13;
Currently, in Romania 66 doses/1,000 inhabitants and coverage o f around 13% o f the persons&#13;
with an increased risk is realized. Within the inter-pandemic periods the country wants to reach&#13;
the optimal flu control coverage level o f 150 doses/1,000 inhabitants, covering at least 50% o f&#13;
the population with an increased risk, i.e. around 2,500,000 doses. A significant increase could&#13;
be realized through the vaccine compensation by the National House o f the Health Insurances&#13;
(CNAS) for the persons with an increased risk (elderly, chronic patients etc.), as it i s practised in&#13;
most European countries. Due to budgetary constraints the Romanian M S can purchase only&#13;
limited flu vaccine quantities (in2003 1.1milliondoses, growingto 1.5 million doses in2005).&#13;
&#13;
26. In a pandemic situation, the Romanian vaccination policy is relying on its national&#13;
manufacturer (Institute Cantacuzino), for the manufacturing o f around 5,500,000 univalent&#13;
vaccine doses (3rd option o f the WHO pandemic plan), which can be done in the upgraded and&#13;
expanded facility proposed under the project. This would assure the coverage o f around 25% o f&#13;
the country population. Priority groups are identified in accordance with WHO: medical-sanitary&#13;
personnel, personnel within communitarian strategic and essential services, officials in social&#13;
and/or pathological areas, and persons that present a high risk o f flu infection (elderly, chronic&#13;
patients, pregnant women, babies, etc.). The cost of vaccination within the inter-pandemic period&#13;
i s approximately EUR 2 per dose (one dose per patient), amounting to EUR 3 million in2005. In&#13;
case o f a pandemic, the recommended vaccine coverage should reach 30 to 50% o f the&#13;
population (monovalent), which can be realized mainly through its own production and less&#13;
through imports, because in this case WHO recommends the vaccine supplies be directed&#13;
towards non-manufacturing countries. The production capacity o f monovalent vaccines o f the&#13;
sole national producer Cantacuzino i s around 5,500,000 doses within a period o f 60 days from&#13;
receiving the viral strains from WHO. The 5,500,000 doses represent 25% coverage and the&#13;
approximated cost would be around EUR 12 million (to be allotted through a governmental&#13;
decision).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   - 87 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27. Assumptions on the regional (in-country) and international spread of a pandemic, the speed&#13;
o f the intervention, the type o f intervention, and the type o f viral strain (growth potential for fast&#13;
vaccine production) are further complicating factors in modelling the economic and financial&#13;
benefits o f the proposed project. It i s clear however, that increasing the capacity o f the national&#13;
producer produces the following advantages: a) increased immunization coverage resulting in&#13;
lower morbidity, b) reduced procurement costs, c) shorter response times (faster intervention by&#13;
which slowing down the spread o f the disease and reducing the morbidity, d) spare capacity in&#13;
case o f global shortage, e) better flexibility (response time, adjust to needs), f) improved access&#13;
and availability o f vaccines to district authorities, and g) immediate switch to monovalent&#13;
vaccine form and immunization ifneeded.&#13;
&#13;
28. The price o f the nationally produced influenza vaccine (seasonal) is approximately 30%&#13;
below the prices o f multinational companies inRomania, where price levels o f influenza vaccine&#13;
are approximately half o f those in western EU countries. In the case o f a pandemic (or even&#13;
widespread endemic) price levels o f multinational products in Romania will very quickly adjust&#13;
to international price levels and vaccines might become unaffordable for the Romanian&#13;
population. The estimated budget requirements are presented inthe following table.&#13;

29. The intended investments in the national vaccine production result (even without a&#13;
pandemic) in a government (or insurance fund) budget saving o f EUR 1.3 million annually (at&#13;
price and coverage level 2005). This implies a return o f the investment in maximum 3 years. In&#13;
the case o f a pandemic, the cost savings by far outweigh the investment (EUR 12 million saved&#13;
through an investment o f app. EUR 5 million). The economic benefits however are larger,&#13;
mainly achieved by the possibility o f a faster response, less relying on imports (in a time o f&#13;
shortage), and a better adjustment to local needs (contain the pandemic). Whether these&#13;
economic benefits materialize i s largely depending on the organizational response o f the&#13;
authorities. These elements are hard to factor into an economic impact model. The following&#13;
table estimates the economic impact:&#13;

            Romania - Avian Influenza Control and Human
            Pandemic Preparedness and Response (APL) Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Romania Avian Influenza Control and
            Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response (APL) Project
            supports and constitutes an integral part of a national
            program to increase Romania's avian and human influenza
            preparedness. In this context, the overall development
            objective o f the project is to reduce the threat posed to
            humans and the poultry sector in Romania by Avian Flu and
            other zoonoses, and to support the preparation for, control
            of, and response to influenza pandemics and other infectious
            disease emergencies in humans. The project has three
            components each with multiple sub-components that support
            activities in prevention, preparedness, contingency
            planning, response, and containment. Component 1 focuses on
            animal health: it strengthens veterinary institutions;
            improves Avian Flu prevention and control planning;
            strengthens monitoring and surveillance systems, diagnostic
            capacity, animal diseases information systems, applied
            veterinary research capacity, and Avian flu control
            programs; supports poultry vaccination campaigns; and
            improves bio-security in poultry production and trade.
            Component 2 focuses on human health by enhancing Public
            Health Program Planning and Coordination; and Strengthening
            o f National Public Health Surveillance Systems and the
            health system's response capacity. Component 3 funds
            public awareness, communication, and implementation support.
