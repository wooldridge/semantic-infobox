            Post-conflict infrastructure - trends in
            aid and investment flows
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            As war and civil strife subside, can
            governments turn to the private sector to restore basic
            services? Post-conflict countries suffer from
            disproportionately low levels of private investment in
            infrastructure, with only small-scale service providers
            likely to emerge during, and right after conflict. Larger
            investors are slow to enter, and when they do, they focus
            almost exclusively on the easily secured, and most
            profitable sub-sectors. Yet, some countries have been able
            to couple aggressive reform and liberalized policies to
            attract infrastructure investments soon after conflict
            abates. What does their experience tell us? This Note
            summarizes an analysis from a companion paper, and explores
            policy options for post-conflict countries seeking to
            attract private investment in infrastructure. It suggests
            improving the underlying factors influencing political and
            economic risk ratings, for it may lead to faster growth in
            infrastructure investment in conflict-affected countries,
            than in other developing countries.
