THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;
                                                               Region: Latin America &amp; Caribbean&#13;

regulations applying to domestic small to medium-size          Income category: Upper middle income&#13;
businesses through their life cycle. Economies are ranked&#13;
from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 123,799,215&#13;
Doing Business presents results for 2 aggregate measures:&#13;
the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 9,980&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 38&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 42*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;

The ease of doing business ranking compares economies&#13;
with one another; the distance to frontier score               DB 2015 DTF: 72.15&#13;

can show only how much the regulatory environment has          starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016&#13;
changed relative to that in other economies.                   report for sources and definitions.&#13;

Just as the overall ranking on the ease of doing business             Doing Business introduced the distance to frontier score.&#13;
tells only part of the story, so do changes in that ranking.          This measure shows how far on average an economy is&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such&#13;
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the&#13;
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economyâ&#128;&#153;s name&#13;
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business&#13;

        The time and cost of updating the building record are&#13;
        established by the Financial Code of the Federal District, Article&#13;
        217. The building is not actually registered with the Property&#13;
        Registry. Once built, a cadastral actualization document&#13;
        (manifestacion de actualisacion del valor cadastral) is filed for tax&#13;
        purposes with the Tax Ministry. The information in the new deed&#13;
        is updated only when the property (with the building included) is&#13;
  10    sold. In Mexico, the owner of the land is automatically the owner           1 day          no charge&#13;
        of the building unless otherwise specified. Only in cases where&#13;
        the owner of the building and the owner of the property are two&#13;
        different people would the building be registered.&#13;

Access to reliable and affordable electricity is vital for     WHAT THE GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
businesses. To counter weak electricity supply, many&#13;
firms in developing economies have to rely on self-            INDICATORS MEASURE&#13;
supply, often at a prohibitively high cost. Whether&#13;
electricity is reliably available or not, the first step for   Procedures to obtain an electricity connection&#13;
a customer is always to gain access by obtaining a             (number)&#13;
connection.&#13;
                                                                 Submitting all relevant documents and&#13;
What do the indicators cover?                                    obtaining all necessary clearances and permits&#13;
Doing Business records all procedures required for a             Completing all required notifications and&#13;

as well as the time and cost to complete them. These             Obtaining external installation works and&#13;
procedures include applications and contracts with               possibly purchasing material for these works&#13;
electricity utilities, clearances from other agencies            Concluding any necessary supply contract and&#13;
and the external and final connection works. In                  obtaining final supply&#13;
addition, this year Doing Business adds two new&#13;
measures: the reliability of supply and transparency           Time required to complete each procedure&#13;

The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;

and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the&#13;
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-&#13;
use tariff is available.&#13;

      * The notary requests a commercial valuation of the property&#13;
&#13;
      A commercial valuation is required under the Fiscal Code of the Federal&#13;
      District to determine the taxable value of the property subject to transfer.&#13;
      Article 116 of the Fiscal Code of the Federal District establishes that the&#13;
      property tax shall be calculated taking in to account the highest of (i) the&#13;
      purchase price, (ii) the cadastral value, and (iii) the value resulting from&#13;
      the commercial valuation by the fiscal authorities or authorized&#13;
      appraiser.&#13;
&#13;
      The notaries usually have their own appraisers. Nevertheless, the parties            7 days&#13;
      may hire the appraiser they choose. When banks are involved in the              (simultaneous MXN 3,000 - MXN&#13;
5&#13;
      transaction, they will usually bring in the valuers they usually work with.    with Procedures     5,500&#13;
      Sometimes parties have a previous valuation, and the notary can have it           1, 2, 3 &amp; 4)&#13;
      reviewed to see if it suffices. However, these previous valuations are&#13;
      usually not fiscal ones and therefore another one has to be done to&#13;
      determine the value of the property for the ISAI tax, but also for the VAT&#13;
      tax to which commercial constructions are subject to when transferred&#13;
      (please note that the land is not taxable under VAT, just the commercial&#13;
      constructions).&#13;

PAYING TAXES&#13;
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes&#13;
faster, easier and less costly for businessesâ&#128;&#148;such as by          have brought concrete results. Some economies&#13;
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen&#13;
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business&#13;

&#13;
                   Mexico increased taxes on companies by raising several tax&#13;
                   rates, including the corporate income tax and the rate on cash&#13;
DB2011             deposits. At the same time, the administrative burden was&#13;
                   reduced slightly with more options for online payment and&#13;
                   increased use of accounting software.&#13;
                   Mexico continued to ease the administrative burden of paying&#13;
                   taxes for firms by ending the requirement to file a yearly value&#13;

                   Mexico made paying taxes easier for companies by abolishing&#13;
                   the business flat taxâ&#128;&#148;though it also made paying taxes more&#13;
                   costly by allowing only a portion of salaries to be deductible.&#13;

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous&#13;
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost&#13;
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary&#13;
requirements than does the number of documents required.&#13;

ENFORCING CONTRACTS&#13;
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to&#13;
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making&#13;
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           contract enforcement faster. What reforms making it&#13;

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal&#13;
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

                                            The Law of the Commercial Insolvency Law (LCM) provides a unitary&#13;
                                            form of insolvency proceedings (concurso mercantil) which has two&#13;
                                            phases: Conciliation (reorganization) and Bankruptcy (Liquidation).&#13;
                                            Mirage would commence a reorganization proceeding (conciliation) by&#13;
              Mexico City,                  filing for a â&#128;&#156;concurso mercantilâ&#128;&#157; in light of Art. 10 of the (LCM). It will&#13;
Proceeding                   reorganization&#13;
              Monterrey                     be sufficient to demonstrate that the debtor is generally unable to pay&#13;
                                            its debts as they mature. One of the main advantages of this option is&#13;
                                            that once the â&#128;&#156;concurso mercantilâ&#128;&#157; commences, all all enforcement&#13;
                                            actions against the debtor would be automatically suspended,&#13;
                                            allowing Mirage to reorganize.&#13;
&#13;
              Mexico City,                    Since it would be possible to reach a reorganization agreement, the&#13;

              Monterrey                       hotel will continue operating as a going concern.&#13;

                                              It would take approximately 21 months to resolve an insolvency&#13;
                                              proceeding in Mexico City, similar to the case study, in which a debtor&#13;
                                              reaches a reorganization agreement with its creditors and the&#13;
                                              agreement is approved. All necessary steps to complete the entire&#13;
 Time (in     Mexico City,                    process are included within this estimate, including the appointment&#13;

                                              145 of the Commercial Insolvency Law is rarely enforced, but it is taken&#13;
                                              into account when approving the agreement.&#13;

The distance to frontier score captures the gap between&#13;

Calculating the distance to frontier score for each           or construction, including legal index scores (such as the&#13;

the nonlinear transformation, an increase in the total tax&#13;

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it&#13;
would have had before this approach was adopted in&#13;
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in&#13;
figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report). And for&#13;
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;
C in figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report).&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;
weights&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for Mexico.
            To allow for useful comparison, the profile also provides
            data for other selected economies (comparator economies) for
            each indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the 13th edition in a
            series of annual reports measuring the regulations that
            enhance business activity and those that constrain it.
            Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business; for
            2015 Mexico ranks 38. A high ease of doing business ranking
            means the regulatory environment is more conducive to the
            starting and operation of a local firm. Doing Business
            presents quantitative indicators on business regulations and
            the protection of property rights that can be compared
            across 189 economies from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe and over
            time. Doing Business sheds light on how easy or difficult it
            is for a local entrepreneur to open and run a small to
            medium-size business when complying with relevant
            regulations. It measures and tracks changes in regulations
            affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a business: starting
            a business, dealing with construction permits, getting
            electricity, registering property, getting credit,
            protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across
            borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency and labor
            market regulation. The data in this report are current as of
            June 1, 2015 (except for the paying taxes indicators, which
            cover the period from January to December 2014).
