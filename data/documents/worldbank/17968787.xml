&#13;
OLIVER.     Mr. Bell, it Is. a great pleasure to have you back and to make up for          request.    This memorandum was acheduled for discussion by the Loan Committee,&#13;
&#13;
lost time in this adventure.       I wonder if you would begin by explaining               then the top body of the Bank.       In the course of that discussion, all members&#13;
&#13;
something of your singular relationship with Hr. McNamara at the time of                   of the Loan Committee except two were enthusiastically in favor of meeting          th~&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia.                                                                                 Indonesian request.      The two who were opposed were Burke Knapp, who was the&#13;
&#13;
BELL:     Maybe I should start by going back co March of 1968, just prior to the           senior vice president of the Bank, and ayself          for entirely different&#13;
&#13;
time that    HcNama~a   took office aa President of the Bank.       I waa at that time     reasons.    He was opposed because he thought that it might detract from the&#13;
&#13;
Deputy Director for Economics in the Projects Depart.ant. I hadn't travelled               responsibility and authority of the Washington office, and he was opposed to&#13;
&#13;
anywhere for several years, and Mr. Aldewereld and Hr. Chadenet, who were my               that.    I argued against it on tWo grounds:      first, that Indonesia had such a&#13;
&#13;
chiefs there, kept urging me to take a trip somewhere, anywhere, and deal with             terrible reputation at the time as a place to live that none of the good&#13;
&#13;
several matters that were outstanding with a number of countries.            I agreed to   people on the Bank staff would be willing to go, and, unless the very best&#13;
&#13;
do that. I said, among other things, that I would like to go to Indonesia,                 people in the Bank went, it would be a mistake because the Indonesian team&#13;
&#13;
which I had last visited in September of 1963.                                             would be far superior and wouldn't learn anything       fro~   them; and second, that&#13;
&#13;
           I went to Indonesia for four or five days and, in the course of that            the   ~ashington   bureaucracy would try to prevent the staff in Indonesia from&#13;
&#13;
four or five days, the Indonesian economic team was discussing the outlines of             exercising the independence and authority it would need to be effective.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               )                                                                                       4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Burke said that he thought that he and I should have a private discussion with         handicapped people, especially handicapped children Â·- either physically or&#13;
&#13;
McNamara and tell him why we had opposed the .ajority      reco~endat!on      to the   psychologically handicapped, and Boston University had a very good faculty In&#13;
&#13;
committee.     He would let me know when we could do that.                             this area and a very good curriculum.      She wanted to go there. but her&#13;
&#13;
             had never met McNamara up until that time.    A few days later Burke      academic record was not particula.rly brilliant.       The first reply fro111 Boston&#13;
&#13;
called me and said,    M~e   don't need ro have a discussion." He had already had      University to her 1n1t1al letter of application had been somewhat&#13;
&#13;
it himself.     I said, "Well, O.K.â&#128;¢ And   aas~d   the proposal was dead, though       discouraging.     I felt I wanted to stay here and help her actually to get in.&#13;
&#13;
probably for the wrong reasons.       Several daya after that, Hr. Aldewereld, who             McNamara (this will tell you something about him) picked up the phone&#13;
&#13;
was the head of the Projects Department, called me and said, "Hr. McNamara             and said to his secretary, "Get me Eunice" -Â· that was Eunice Kennedy. She&#13;
&#13;
wants to see you at 6:00 this afternoon.â&#128;¢       I asked what about.      He said he    did.   I could hear his end of the conversation and guessed the other end.            l!e&#13;
&#13;
didn't know.     So 1 went. That was the firat ri-. I had met HcN&amp;Q4ta. He told        said, "Eunice, I know you are very busy packing because you and Sargent are&#13;
&#13;
me that he was very much in favor of rhe recomaendation which the Loan                 leaving to1110rrow." (Sargent Shriver, her husband, had just been appointed&#13;
&#13;
Co~ittee     had made, that a resident staff be established with w1de                  Ambassador to France.) "But there is something I want you to do.         There is a&#13;
&#13;
responsibility. He wanted me to head it and asked if I would.         I said, "No,"    little girl who wants to get into Boston University and her chances don't look&#13;
&#13;
and he said, "I want you to think it over, but just offhand without any                very good." There vas â&#128;¢oâ&#128;¢e more conversation.        Then he hung up and turned to&#13;
&#13;
commitment on your part, could you tell me some of the       reasons.~                 me and said,     "Well, that'â&#128;¢ settled, she's ln".     That was McNamara.      I ce.n't&#13;
&#13;
        I told him that I could think of about 8 reasons offhand, four of              recall what my    othe~   tWO personal reasons were. In any case he had an answer&#13;
&#13;
which were entirely personal and four related to the way in which the Bank             for those.&#13;
&#13;
operated.     He asked if I could tell him what they were, and I mentioned that                Then I said, "On the side of che of the Bank, the Sank ts a highly&#13;
&#13;
on the personal side both my wife and I had elderly mothers who were ill, and          Washington centralized opera.tlon.     I know from experience as Deputy Director&#13;
&#13;
we didn't think that this was a ti.a we wanted to be away.         To which he said    of the Projects Department that many     depart~ents   in Washington consider it&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢Well, you and your wife can make as many trips back here at Bank expense as           their religious duty to ignore or contradict any recommenda.tion       n~ade   by field&#13;
&#13;
you feel are necessary to take care of that." That answered that.                      staff, and that would continue and be a constant struggle, which would be a&#13;
&#13;
        Then 1 said another reason was that I had a daughter who had just              waste of time."    That was the point at which he sa.id, "I have dealt with&#13;
&#13;
completed her first two years of college in the Washington area and wanted to          bigger bureaucracies than this one and I can take care of that. I will rule&#13;
&#13;
transfer to Boston University because she was interested in working with               that no one in the Washington office can ignore or controvert in ":ny way any&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              5&#13;

&#13;
approval.      I said 1 thought that might work. It certainly did.    There were to   strongly disagreeing with US Government policy on Vietnam, refused to speak to&#13;
&#13;
my memory only two or three instances in four years in which anybody in               him, which didn't help.&#13;
Vashlngton went to him to try to get hia approval of their disagreement with                    Indonesia was clearly one of his main interests when he came to the&#13;
&#13;
the resident staff.     On one of those occasions he agreed with them, and on the     Bank    and this influenced his decision to establish a    reside~t   staff in&#13;
&#13;
others he did not.     In any case it scared them sufficiently so that they           response to Indonesia's request, although I'm quite aura he had this in mind&#13;
&#13;
rarely ignored or disputed our recommendations that went to him.                      even before the request came.     He had been President of the Bank for&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Uhy was Indonesia such a special case?                                    approximately one month and it was almost the first action he took aside from&#13;
&#13;
BELL:     That's an interesting question about which I have speculated quite a        routine ones.&#13;
&#13;
lot.     I haven't wanted to ask KcNam.ra that directly. For one thing, the Bank                When I mentioned another one of my organizational objections, namely&#13;
&#13;
had totally neglected Indonesia.     The Bank's only connection with Indonesia        that I thought â&#128;¢any good people in the Bank would not be eager to go to&#13;
&#13;
was that, sometlâ&#128;¢a in the late 50s, it had sent an economic mission to                Indonesia, .&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia which prepared in    ~aahington   a report which was duly put into the      OLIVER;    Hay I stop you for just a â&#128;¢inute to ask whether or not McNamara, in&#13;
&#13;
files.     I don't know Whether anybody aver read it; cettainly nothing came of       your opinion, had already decided that he had to have a directly reporting&#13;
&#13;
it.     McNamara felt that this waa the fifth largest country in the world,           reeident mission in Indonesia, or wee this vary     m~ch   tied up with you,&#13;
&#13;
anxious for economic and social progress, and that the     ~orld   Bank couldn't      yourself?&#13;
&#13;
ignore it.                                                                            BELL:     I think, although I have never confirmed this with him, that he had in&#13;
&#13;
           I've also speculated that there is a connection between his interest       fact decided, even before the Indonesia request came to him via the Loan&#13;
&#13;
in Indonesia and his feeling about Viet Ham. I hesitate to say this, but I            Committee, that the Bank needed to establish a resident staff in Indonesia,&#13;
&#13;
will to you.      I've said it to ala1ost no one else.   In part I think there was    that the Bank knew nothing about Indonesia, and that the only way that it&#13;
&#13;
a kind of expiation on his pert for what he now regarded as his earlier               co~ld   effectively assist Indonesia was with a staff of people on the ground&#13;
&#13;
mistaken views about Viet Ham.     Viet Â·Nam was a very painful thing for             Uhether he had also decided that he    wo~ld   strengthen the authority and&#13;
&#13;
McNamara.     He clearly changed his mind at some point about what the US should      responsibility of that staff by making it report only to him, I have no idea&#13;
&#13;
be doing vis-a-vis Viet Ham.     It was that change of mind which, I believe, led     He may have had some such idea, but I am sure it was strengthened by my saying&#13;
&#13;
to his leaving the US government and becoming the President of the World Bank.        that it would be extremely difficult for the staff to be effective when all&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                                            8&#13;

the departments in Yashington would consider it their religious duty to                    Indonesia case, McNamara was thinking in operational terms.          For the Bank&#13;
&#13;
disagree with anything that was recommended and would consider it an insult to             effectively to assist the Indonesians, there had to be a staff on the spot&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                     '&#13;
have any authority placed in that staff.                                                   think he was quite right about that.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
unwilling to reside in Jakarta and partly because their superiors would refuse             the latter years of the Sukarno regime.     He was called the first minister&#13;
&#13;
to release them for that purpose.        He said,   ~I'll   taka care of that.   I will    because Sukarno liked to call himself both President and Prime Minister. but&#13;

looking very dejected.     He said to me, â&#128;¢you might as well go home,             You'll be       to Yashington and there applied for a loan of $100          ~lllion    to help finance&#13;

course of a party at the Hotel Indonesia.        His daughters, whom I know,                      promptly and for three years thereafter we did our best to provide the&#13;
continue to tell me that that was no heart attack, that he was poisoned.                    I     assistance and choice the govern.ent of Indonesia requested, much of it&#13;

suspect, they are right.     Sukarno and his then foreign        ~iniater,      Subandrio,        unrelated to the Ex-Im loan.&#13;
&#13;
knew that Djuanda vas potentially their chief rival.           They knew what 1 knew                      I have gone in to all of this by way of helping to explain why I thought&#13;
&#13;
that the top generals in the    ar~y   had asked Djuanda whether, if they took over               the resident ataff operation, which McNamara started, waa very successful.&#13;
&#13;
to try to save the country, he would run the government for             the~.     I knew what     mention all this to support one of the points I was going to make about why we&#13;

his answer had been, which wss, â&#128;¢tf you fellas an ever agree among yourselves                     had been succeaaful, which was that from the very beginning the Indonesians&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER;     So the whole restructuring plan went out the window?                                  thought that anyone whom Ojuanda wanted as his advisor was a good man for&#13;
&#13;
&amp;ELL:     Yes, totally.                                                                           them.&#13;

&#13;
were very interested since you already had prior experience in Indonesia.                         &amp;ELL:     Including the army.     We had a good start for that reason, and I&#13;

&amp;ELL:     Exactly. I was very much interested in Indonesia and I had been sine"                   ~anaged,    with the help of    HcNa~ara's   decree chat nobody could scand in the way&#13;

my first encounter with it in    Oec.,~ber   1949.   I was then the chief economist               of somebody going to join the resident staff, to get a good staff.               We had,&#13;

the final sgre.,ment terminating hostilities and recognizing Indonesian                           worked really as part of the government; we were, among other things, a&#13;

various ministries and departments in the government of Indonesia didn't talk                 companies would pay aixtyÂ·flve percent of their profita to Pertamina. It was&#13;

to each other very much. We ware, aaong other things, the channel of                          60 of that 65, not 60 percent of the 65, but 60 out of the 65 which, under the&#13;

&#13;
issue, which was whether the pay.enta by foreign oil companiea under their                    lack of communication in the government and our role in establishing it.&#13;

&#13;
independently of that Wldjoyo recognizing that the issue had to be decided                    In fact, he had been there for several months by that time. He, too, was very&#13;
&#13;
between. himself as the leader of the team of economic ministers, and the                     much trusted and used by the Indonesians. He and 1 worked very closely&#13;
&#13;
General who headed Pertamina asked me to negotiate the question with General                  together.     We were in continuous discussion with the Indonesian economic team&#13;
&#13;
Ibnu Sutano, who was the head of       Pert~ina   and with whom, for aome reason              about what they should be doing in their trade regulation, exchange rates,&#13;
&#13;
which      don't understand, I had a good relationship.      We used to â&#128;¢eet several          fiscal and monetary policy, etc., etc.&#13;
&#13;
times a week and talk about various things.         We both smoked Lucky Strikes.         l              There wete several devaluations in the period that we were there, '68-&#13;
&#13;
think we were the only two people in the country who did.                                     '72, and there was a unification of exchange rates.       Several rates were in use&#13;
&#13;
           Long before the committee reached any conclusion General Sutano and I,             at the time in â&#128;¢68 when we started.       There was a unification; there was a&#13;
&#13;
with Widjoyo behind me all the time, had reached an agreement on what the                     movement, as I recall, to a single rate of 420 rupiah co the dollar.          That&#13;
&#13;
arrangement should be.      It was incorporated into what was called the Pertamlna            rate prevailed until, I believe, 1978 when there was a one time devaluation&#13;
&#13;
Law.    At that time, it provided that sixty percent of       ~he   contractor profits,       fro~    420 to, I think it was, 620. I was vety much involved in that one.        It&#13;
&#13;
oil company profits, should go to the        gover~ent   and anything over that which         was just shortly after I retired from the Bank.        (I retired at the end of&#13;

January. 1977.)     I still remember that for a period of months, all through the     ministers.     Some were their ideas, which they suggested to, and discussed with&#13;
&#13;
Spring of 1968, everybody was writing memoranda to the economic ministers of          us. I should emphasize that everything we did was in agreement with them.          Ye&#13;
&#13;
the government on the subject of devaluation.       Some of that advice was           didn't undertake any independent actions and neither did they.       We worked as a&#13;
&#13;
solicited, some was volunteered.     They were not all in agreement either on the     team, in complete cooperation.       They didn't always accept fully every&#13;
&#13;
question of whether there should be a devaluation at all, or how much of a            recommendation we made.      They made their own decisions on   ev~rything   Â·Â· as we&#13;
&#13;
devaluation.                                                                          thought appropriate.       For the most part, those decisions were decisions that&#13;
&#13;
           I was one of those who wrote such a memo. Discussions went on for          we in the course of discussions had agreed were the proper ones. Sometimes&#13;

summer, then went out there again, I think it was early in the fall of '78.           they couldn't go ahead along certain lines.      They may even have thought that&#13;
&#13;
The first person I went to see was Minister Ali Wardhzna, Minister of Finance,        our economic reasoning was bad at certain points, although I can't really&#13;
&#13;
the first afternoon I was there.      He greeted me by saying, KYell, we've made      recall any of those.       If they did think so, they were too polite to mention&#13;

the decision. It's what you (and some others) recommend; only five people in          â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;

wasn't really very much interested.       Therefore, I was saying,     "No."                 OLIVER:     So in any event you went to East Africa.&#13;
&#13;
          Hr. McNa.ara said that he thought I shouldn't be precipitate about                 BELL:     Yea, I did.   1 started to try to learn something about East Africa,&#13;
&#13;
this; 1 ought to think about it and come back to his office at 11;00 with an                 which I knew nothing about and which I found was quite different from&#13;
&#13;
answer.     I went back at 11:00 and said that I had thought it over and the                 Indonesia.     For that aattar moat of East Asia and the Pacific were different&#13;
&#13;
answer was no.     ~ereupon,    somewhat to .y surprise, he aaid,    ~You   don't really     from Eaat Africa for â&#128;¢any reasons some of which I'll mention.      The governments&#13;
&#13;
have a choice.     You can either accept the position, or leave the Bank."          I        of the countries of East Africa were not undertaking wall planned, well&#13;
&#13;
said, without a lot of thought, I would leave the Bank. Whereupon he said,                   conceived, and vigorously executed progrags of development.       There were in&#13;
&#13;
"Well, will you take the position sa a personal favor to .e?"         To which I             .oat of the Eaet African countries even fewer people with any experience,&#13;
&#13;
could only say, "If you put it on that basis, I can't say no."                               education, or training of the kind required for development. There were other&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Have you any idea what was behind this?    Was it just that the ti-.             reasons.     If I knew more about East Africa, I'd probably understand some of&#13;
&#13;
had come to go back onto a country basis and gat out from under tha direct                   them.&#13;
&#13;
line to HcNagara, or was it something mora than that?                                        OLIVER: Well East Asia is a relatively lush place basically, and East Africa&#13;
&#13;
BELL:     I've never actually asked Hr. HcNamara directly why he wanted this.           He   is a relatively barren place I would have said.&#13;
&#13;
said that he felt that the Bank had rather neglected East Africa and that a                  BELL: Yes, and no.      Soma of the countries of East Africa are rich in mineral&#13;
&#13;
~ch more vigorous prograg in relati~n to East Africa had to be undertaken.                   resources.&#13;
&#13;
He thought that 1 could do it.       There may have been other reasons.        It may        OLIVER:     Not ln agriculture.   You couldn't have doubled, I would have said,&#13;
&#13;
have been that the complaints about the way the resident missions operated,                  production in ten years in East Africa.&#13;
&#13;
complaints from departments in the Bank, were cumulative and had so.ethfng to                BELL:     No, 1 don't think that would have been pos91ble, but 1 think&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 27                                                                                   28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
significant increases in      ~any   of the countries would have been possible,   In    meeting with President Hobutu together with his personal assistant, who          ne~t&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Tanzania, for example, where, with the best of intentions and greatest degree           to Mobutu was the most powerful man in the government. Mobutu was a very&#13;
&#13;
of interest on the part of the leaders of the government in development and             striking personality.     He started the meeting, after the   e~change   of&#13;
economic progress, they were unaucceaaful.        They had, I discovered in my one      greetings, by saying, wNo doubt you've heard lots of things about me from your&#13;
brief visit there, failed quite completely in attempting to increase                    American and Belgian friends, including that 1 am an alcoho1ic, a dope fiend,&#13;
agricultural production by establishing collectives and cooperatives.                   a terrible womanizer, one of the richest men in the world, and one of the&#13;
           I recall very vividly a trip in which, together with the Tanzanian           worst crooks in the world.     Don't believe a word of it; none of it's true.&#13;
Ambassador to the United States, I visited several cooperative farms and we             like to drink once in a while, I like a woman once in awhile.       I've never&#13;
&#13;
found that there was a lot of modern equipment and machinery just sitting               taken dope in my life and my personal fortune is quite modest.&#13;
&#13;
around unused,       At mid-day there were a lot of quite healthy men asleep in                      He then said, and this is interesting, â&#128;¢You know you spent quite a&#13;
&#13;
front of a storehouse which was pretty empty.         The kinds of incentives that      lot of time at this meeting you've been conducting discussing this very large.&#13;
&#13;
had been established were si-PlY ineffective.         Tanzania was one of the places    short-tarâ&#128;¢ debt which we have recently accumulated in Europe and debating the&#13;
&#13;
where the country was atte-Pting to do something, but I think it was                    question of what could be done about it.     You have also been discussing how&#13;
&#13;
misconceived.                                                                           stupid we ware to incur that debt.     Let me tell you why and how we incurred&#13;
&#13;
           In the brief period that l was involved with East Africa, one of the         that debt.     We had aoaa urgent needs which we couldn't meet, end just at that&#13;
&#13;
places I found most interesting was Zaire. I went there once when I decided             point the Arabs came to .. and said, If you will break relations with Israel,&#13;
&#13;
that the consultative group on Zaire ought really to .aet in Zaire rather than          we will lend you (I've forgotten the figure, $10 billion dollars, or something&#13;
&#13;
in Paris.       That was after I discovered thst the last time it had met in Paris,     on that order) â&#128;¢payable at the end of 20 years with zero interest.        That's all&#13;
&#13;
representatives of the Zairian government hadn't even appeared.         I thought if    we had to do to get it.     So I went on nationÂ·wide TV and radio and said, The&#13;
&#13;
they were to be interested and to be involved in an effort, the beat thing to           Israeli's are our very good friends. They have helped us enormously, but the&#13;
&#13;
do was to have a meeting in Kenshasa. McNamara and others agreed that was a             Arabs are our brothers.     So we are breaking diplomatic relations with Israel.&#13;
&#13;
good idea.       There were some objectioris from some people but they didn't           He said, â&#128;¢As soon as l had done that, I got in toueh with our Arab friends.&#13;
&#13;
prevail.                                                                                and they began to talk about a loan of $500,000 payable in 5 years.           In the&#13;
&#13;
           ~.   had that meeting, and it was attended by the high officials,            ~antime,     we had, in the expectation of this big loan on very favorable terms.&#13;
&#13;
economic officials, of Zaire.          Immediately subsequent to the meeting, I had a   put it all in short-term debt to banks in Europe.â&#128;¢ 1 was brash enough to say&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              29                                                                                        30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
to him, "That is easily remedied.      Reestablish relations with Israel." He         felt that I was really much better equipped to work on problems in East Asia.&#13;
&#13;
said, "You know, we may do that."      He didn't until some years later.     He has   I was particularly happy to be again involved with Indonesia and its problems.&#13;
&#13;
now, but that was perhaps a small illustration of the kind of person he was.          Also with other countries that 1 have come to know something about in the&#13;

&#13;
would have excaberated the debt all that much.                                        Malaysia, Taiwan, Korea. As you know, of course, three of those last four are&#13;

BELL:     It didn't, but in the meantiâ&#128;¢a they had borrowed a lot more from            among what are described today as the Four Tigers or something like that.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER:     Overborrowed perhaps.                                                     BELL:     Who have been tremendously successful in increasing their output and&#13;
BELL:     Oh yea, much overborrowed.   He said, "In the expectation that the big      incomes and their exports.&#13;

&#13;
urged, they hadn't eome through on what he said they had promised.                    begun to figure significantly in Indonesia's exports: textiles, garments,&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I understand.   I take it you feel that Zaire has perhaps more            plywood.     They are beginning, I believe, to export machinery and metal&#13;
&#13;
potential than other areas of the region?                                             products.    Laat night, in hia talk to the lndonaaiaÂ·Amerlca society, the&#13;

BELL:     I think in â&#128;¢any ways it does.   It baa vary substantial mineral             Director of Pertaalna said that Indonesia had just concluded contracts for the&#13;

extensive areas well suited to agricultural production which are, were then           countries.     They have already exported   so~.    He said also that within the&#13;

OLIVER:     Well, I guess your next incarnation vas back to East Asla.                urged us ell to buy one.     That 1 had not been aware of.&#13;
&#13;
BELL:     Yes, as of July 1, 1974.                                                    OLIVER:     It should be called the   ~Indo,"   rather than the   "Yugo.~&#13;

OLIVER:    Would it be too much to say You were glad to get back?                     BELL:     1 hope if it happens it will get better ratings than the Yugo. I was&#13;

&#13;
learn something about East Africa and begun to be quite interested, I still           I haven't seen that reference to the Korean car, but I want to find out more&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               3l&#13;

about this Indonesian car.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Well, Hr. Bell we're running out of tape,     We can certainly do&#13;
&#13;
another one, but 1 wonder if you wish to    suqmarl~e   things, particularly from&#13;
&#13;
your Indonesian experience -- put a cap on things, so to speak.&#13;
&#13;
BELL:     In line with what you were suggesting.   1 look at Indonesia as a good&#13;
&#13;
exa~ple   of what can be done by way of   develop~ent   of the so called&#13;
&#13;
underdeveloped countries of the world, what can be done to improve the&#13;
&#13;
conditions of life of the poor which constitute most of the population of&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia and many other countries in the so called Third World.           I look at&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia also as a very good example of the way in which such institutions as&#13;
&#13;
the World Bank can provide constructive assistance.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Thank you.&#13;

            In November 1985 and January 1988,
            Bernard R. Bell was interviewed on behalf of the World Bank
            Group Archives oral history program by Robert W. Oliver.
            During his tenure at the Bank from 1965 to 1977, Mr. Bell
            worked in the following areas: in the projects department as
            assistant director of economics (1965-1967) and as deputy
            director (1967-1968); in Indonesia as director of resident
            staff (1969-1972); in the East Africa region department as
            vice president (1972-1974); and in the East Asia and Pacific
            (EAP) region as regional vice president (1974-1977). Mr.
            Bell also talks about his pre-World Bank experience as chief
            economist of the Export-Import bank in the United States.
            His transcript concerns his ambitions for the World Bank to
            expand the volume of lending to developing countries, a goal
            later achieved under the direction of World Bank president
            Robert McNamara.
