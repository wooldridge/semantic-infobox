October 2015                                                                  THE WORLD BANK&#13;
&amp;#12;Executive summary&#13;
&#13;
 A mild growth         Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s economy posted GDP growth of 4.2 percent in FY2014/15 compared to&#13;
 recovery is           4.0 percent in the previous year, but below the 5.1 percent targeted growth&#13;
 underway.             envisaged for FY2014/15 in the Annual Plan. On the demand side, investment and&#13;
                       government consumption posted strong growth. Private consumption was&#13;
                       supported by record high remittances in the order of US$18.7 billion in FY2014/15.&#13;
                       The share of investment in GDP remains relatively small, at 15.1 percent of GDP,&#13;
                       about half of the South Asian average at 30 percent. More worryingly, private&#13;
                       investment as a share of GDP has been declining and stood at 9.7 percent of GDP&#13;
                       in FY2014/15. This low investment has implications for Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s long term&#13;
                       growth potential that has been on a clear declining long run trend as discussed in&#13;
                       special section III in this issue.&#13;
&#13;
 Lack of               Several factors are contributing to this low investment normal. Constrained fiscal&#13;
 complementary         space limits the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s ability to make the necessary complementary public&#13;
 public investments    investments. In addition, inconsistent trade and industrial policies create&#13;
 and a weak            disincentives for investors and contributes to weak business environment, as&#13;
 investment climate    evidenced by Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s ranking in most international surveys dealing with this issue,&#13;
 are constraining      like the Global Competitiveness Ranking. Another reason for the very low&#13;
 private sector        investment levels has to do with the low domestic savings rate in Pakistan at below&#13;
 investment.           10 percent of GDP, which compares unfavorably with an average of around 25&#13;
                       percent in South Asia. Limited access to financial markets, high dependency ratio&#13;
                       and low returns on financial instruments all contribute to this low rate of savings.&#13;
&#13;
 The services sector   More than two-thirds of the economyâ&#128;&#153;s growth came from the services sector, while&#13;
 continues to be the   industry and agriculture jointly contributed about one-third. In the agricultural&#13;
 main contributor to   sector, crop performance remained weak owing to prolonged adverse weather and&#13;
 growth.               two years of relatively low prices. In the industrial sector, the poor performance was&#13;
                       primarily the result of weak growth in the large-scale manufacturing sector, which&#13;
                       achieved growth of 2.4 percent against a target of 7 percent. Ongoing energy&#13;
                       shortages, limited external demand and structural bottlenecks all constrained&#13;
                       industry growth. The weak growth in the industrial sector also acted as a drag on&#13;
                       related services sectors such as trade and communications, which also posted&#13;
                       relatively slow growth. On the positive side, transport, finance and insurance and&#13;
                       government services all posted strong growth.&#13;
&#13;
 Government efforts    The overall deficit for FY2014/15 was 5.3 percent of GDP, 0.3 percentage points&#13;
 for fiscal            higher than the revised estimates. The declining trend represents a break from the&#13;
 consolidation         recent past, with deficits between 6 and 9 percent of GDP between FY2009-10 and&#13;
 continue, but         FY2012/13. The reduction in the deficit was achieved through curtailing the federal&#13;
 progress is slower    development budget and above target non-tax revenues, while tax revenues&#13;
 than anticipated.     continued to fall short of targets. Energy subsidies remain large, although lower oil&#13;
                       prices have contributed to limiting the energy subsidy bill. Spending grew fastest at&#13;
                       the provincial level due to post 7th NFC award availability of higher resources, and&#13;
                       devolution of increased responsibilities (see special section II for a detailed&#13;
                       discussion of Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s current Fiscal Decentralization Framework). Total public&#13;
                       debt stood at 64.6 percent of GDP at the end of FY2014/15, a slight decline from&#13;
                       the previous year. Domestic debt continues to dominate the debt stock, despite&#13;
                       healthy disbursements by the IFIs, the continuation of the IMF program and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                            I&#13;
&amp;#12;                         successful issuance of international bonds.&#13;
&#13;
A narrowing current      The current account deficit narrowed to US$2.6 billion (from US$3.1 billion in the&#13;
account deficit and      previous year), a result of record high remittances in the order of US$18.7 billion&#13;
large external           and inflows in the services account of Coalition Support Fund (CSF). Remittances&#13;
financial inflows        are concentrated in oil producing countries (Saudi Arabia, UAE), the US and the&#13;
suggest a significant    UK. Remittances from oil producing countries may be negatively affected by low oil&#13;
turnaround in the        prices, but there are no sign of it yet. External financial inflows continued strong,&#13;
external sector, a key   although lower than in the previous year. This is despite very weak Foreign Direct&#13;
concern a few years      Investment (FDI) inflows of 0.3 percent of GDP, the lowest in the last decade. As a&#13;
ago.                     result, the balance of payments was positive for the second year in a row and&#13;
                         international reserves increased by US$4.4 billion to US$13.5 billion by end of&#13;
                         FY2014/15 or more than three months of next yearâ&#128;&#153;s imports (goods and services).&#13;
                         The turnaround on the external front has been quite impressive, which has also led&#13;
                         international rating agencies to upgrade the countryâ&#128;&#153;s sovereign credit ratings in&#13;
                         recent months.&#13;
&#13;
The trade deficit        Exports declined in FY2014/15 and this decline was broad based, a result of both&#13;
widened, as non-oil      low international prices of some of Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s export products as well as weak&#13;
imports increased        external demand. Textiles, which account for about half of all exports, posted a&#13;
due to improved          significant decline. Imports also declined, mainly due to lower international oil and&#13;
economic activity.       commodity prices, although to a lesser extent than exports. Non-oil imports&#13;
                         increased significantly, in particular metals, food, machinery and wood and paper&#13;
                         products. As a result, the trade deficit widened in absolute terms.&#13;
&#13;
Reserves buildup         As a result of the positive developments in the external sector, the Pakistan Rupee&#13;
contributed to           (PKR) remained largely stable with a small depreciation of about 3.0 percent against&#13;
stability in foreign     the US$ during FY2014/15. A relatively stable nominal exchange rate against the&#13;
exchange markets,        US$ and sharply falling inflation resulted in the REER appreciating by about 8.0&#13;
which contributed to     percent during the period under review, which affected the competitiveness of the&#13;
low inflation.           tradable sector. Average inflation declined by around 4 percentage points to 4.5&#13;
                         percent in FY2014/15, its lowest level in a decade, the result of declining oil prices&#13;
                         being passed on to consumers and a stable exchange rate. The decline in inflation&#13;
                         was broad based, with both food and non-food items contributing to the&#13;
                         deceleration in inflation.&#13;
&#13;
Improved                 The stability in PKR and the government decision to pass-on the benefit of falling&#13;
macroeconomic            international oil prices eased inflation considerably. All this allowed State Bank of&#13;
conditions allowed       Pakistan (SBP) to ease monetary policy through a cumulatively cut of its policy rate&#13;
SBP to ease its policy   by 350 bps in FY2014/15. While reserve money grew by 9.9 percent in FY2014/15,&#13;
stance during            broad money supply grew by 13.2 percent. Reserve money growth was influenced&#13;
FY2014/15 while the      by government efforts to limit borrowing from the SBP. At the same time, broad&#13;
government               money growth was driven by the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s borrowing from the commercial&#13;
borrowed heavily         banks to finance the deficit and reduce financing from the SBP. As a result,&#13;
from the banking         government borrowing from commercial banks expanded by PKR 1.3 trillion in&#13;
sector.                  FY2014/15, compared to PKR 0.1 trillion in the previous year.&#13;
&#13;
Credit to the private    The private sector borrowed PKR 209 billion in FY2014/15, a decline from PKR&#13;
sector remains           371 billion in the previous year. Structural bottlenecks as well as weak external&#13;
sluggish â&#128;&#147; a             demand constrained business activity and credit demand by the private sector. A&#13;
combination of both      relatively high real cost of borrowing as inflation declined at a much faster pace than&#13;
supply and demand        lending rates also played a role in subdued private sector credit demand. The fast&#13;
side conditions.         increase in borrowing by the government also tightened financing conditions â&#128;&#147;&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                             II&#13;
&amp;#12;                        which may have led to crowding out of private sector credit. The government has&#13;
                        recently approved a National Financial Inclusion Strategy and started its&#13;
                        implementation, which may help in reversing this trend. For a more detailed&#13;
                        discussion please see section VI in this volume.&#13;
&#13;
The financial sector    The banking sector achieved strong growth, driven primarily by increased&#13;
remains strong with     government borrowing. Risk indicators such as the capital adequacy ratio have&#13;
improving banking       improved over the past year while profitability indicators also remain high. The&#13;
indicators and an       equity market saw considerable investor interest in FY2014/15, despite both&#13;
upward trend in         domestic and external turbulences, but the bond market continues to be dominated&#13;
equity markets.         by government bonds. As in most of the world, capital markets have seen some&#13;
                        volatility over the past few months.&#13;
&#13;
Real GDP growth (at     GDP growth is projected to accelerate to 4.5 percent in FY2015/16 and 4.8 percent&#13;
factor cost) is         in FY2016/17, supported by strong services growth and a slight improvement in the&#13;
projected to register   industry sector. This assumes that some of the constraints affecting the industry&#13;
4.5 percent in          sector, like power outages, will be addressed in the forecast period. Investment is&#13;
FY2015/16, reaching     forecast to increase, given both greater fiscal space as well as an increase in private&#13;
4.8 percent in          sector investment as the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s reform agenda begins to bear fruit.&#13;
FY2016/17.              Investments foreseen in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor will also contribute&#13;
                        to an increase in investment.&#13;
&#13;
External risks have     External and internal balances are projected to improve. The current account will&#13;
increased â&#128;&#147; and         reach around 1 percent of GDP during the forecast period â&#128;&#147; as it will be supported&#13;
despite recent          by robust remittances and a continuation of external financial flows. Fiscal&#13;
reforms Pakistan has    consolidation is projected to continue, and the Government has an ambitious target&#13;
limited buffers to      of reducing the deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP by FY2016/17. Debt levels are&#13;
absorb major shocks.    projected to remain in a slowly declining trend while reserves have already achieved&#13;
                        more comfortable levels. But downside risks remains as a more volatile external&#13;
                        environment going forward may result in lower financial inflows. The slowdown of&#13;
                        the Chinese economy and slow recovery in the Euro zone will weaken external&#13;
                        demand, affecting both trade and investment. Low energy prices benefit Pakistan in&#13;
                        the form of lower energy subsidies and fuel imports â&#128;&#147; but it may eventually affect&#13;
                        remittances, which have been crucial in financing Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s persistent trade deficit&#13;
                        and supporting consumption.&#13;
&#13;
Consistent              Fiscal consolidation will require strong tax revenue efforts by the government as&#13;
implementation of       well as gradual phasing-out of energy-related subsidies and of reduced support to&#13;
the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s        loss-making SOEs. Efforts to tighten fiscal policy will also need closer coordination&#13;
reform agenda will      with the provinces, and ensuring that progress in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s decentralization&#13;
be crucial to           effort better aligns the provinceâ&#128;&#153;s responsibilities with the increased resource&#13;
maintain                envelop that resulted from the 7th NFC award. Efforts to prevent major shocks to&#13;
macroeconomic           the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal stance should also include reducing the fiscal risks of the&#13;
stability and           frequent natural disasters affecting Pakistan â&#128;&#147; an issue discussed in detail in special&#13;
accelerate and          section V. On the external side, it will be important to increase efforts to attract&#13;
maintain growth.        more FDI from the current low levels, by improving the overall business climate&#13;
                        and address regulatory weaknesses at the sectoral level that may be affecting the&#13;
                        countryâ&#128;&#153;s ability to attract investment. Continued implementation of the&#13;
                        governmentâ&#128;&#153;s reform agenda to address structural bottlenecks, in particular in the&#13;
                        energy sector, will also be crucial to be able to attract more investment.&#13;

A mild recovery is                  Following a steady path of recovery, Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s economy registered a GDP growth&#13;
underway.                           rate of 4.24 percent in FY2014/15 compared to 4.03 percent in last year.&#13;
                                    Nevertheless, this performance was below the 5.1 percent targeted growth rate&#13;
                                    envisaged for FY2014/15 in the Annual Plan.&#13;

On the aggregate                    It is quite typical for consumption to be the largest component of aggregate&#13;
demand side,                        demand, however, in the case of Pakistan, it constitutes a very large share of GDP&#13;
consumption                         at 90 percent1 and contributes 3 percentage points towards GDP growth (see&#13;
remained the largest                Figure 1) 2,3. This high level has been driven by private consumption primarily on&#13;

Investment posted                   The share of investment in GDP is relatively small, increasing from 15.0 percent of&#13;
above average                       GDP in FY2013/14 to 15.1 percent of GDP in FY2014/15, driven by an increase&#13;
growth in FY2014/15                 in public investment. Private investment declined from 10.0 percent of GDP in&#13;
but investment levels               FY2013/14 to 9.7 percent of GDP in FY2014/15 â&#128;&#147; the lowest level in the last three&#13;

                                    for this including (a) volatile security situation in the country which has only recently&#13;
                                    started to improve; (b) slow-down in the global economy, which is affecting foreign&#13;

                                    propensity to consume has increased sharply overtime. In 2000s, the private MPC was&#13;

levels are also a            South Asia of 23 percent (average for the past decade). Multiple factors account for&#13;
result of a very low         this low level of savings in Pakistan, including limited access to financial markets,&#13;
savings rate.                high propensity to consume, high dependency ratio and low real returns on financial&#13;

On the supply side,          More than half (2.91 percentage points out of 4.24) of the GDP growth came from&#13;
services sector              services while industry and agriculture contributed 0.73 and 0.6 percentage points&#13;
continued to lead            respectively (see Figure 3). Within agriculture, the overall crop performance&#13;
GDP growth                   remained weak (see Table 1), growing by only 1.0 percent4 owing to prolonged&#13;
followed by industry         adverse weather and two years of relatively low prices. Agriculture was supported,&#13;

Performance in the           The poor performance of industrial sector was solely on account of the Large-Scale&#13;
industrial sector,           Manufacturing (LSM) sector which achieved a growth rate of only 2.4 percent&#13;
which was targeted           against an ambitious target of 7 percent. This target was based on expectations of an&#13;
to grow at 6.8               improvement in energy supplies and export demand from EU markets under the&#13;
percent, was                 GSP Plus arrangement. The strong growth in automobiles sector (at 20 percent) and&#13;
disappointing as it          construction subsectors (at 19 percent) remained an exception. Lower than expected&#13;
only grew at 3.6             performance in other sectors dragged overall LSM growth down. A number of&#13;
percent in                   reasons explain this outcome: (i) continued energy constraints, (ii) limited external&#13;
FY2014/155.                  demand for textiles, (iii) decline in sugar crop production due to price disputes&#13;
                             between sugar crop growers and sugar mills, and (iv) extraordinary growth in some&#13;
                             subsectors like edible oil, Petroleum, Oil, &amp; Lubricants (POL), and fertilizers in&#13;
                             FY2013/14 meant that some form of growth slowdown was expected in&#13;
                             FY2014/15. Within LSM, textile posted a cumulative growth rate of 0.5 percent in&#13;
                             FY2014/15 compared to 1.5 percent in previous year and food posted a growth rate&#13;
&#13;
                             4   Annual target was 3.3 percent while last yearâ&#128;&#153;s growth was registered at 3.2 percent&#13;
                             5   Compared to 4.5 percent in FY2013/14&#13;

Services sector grew         With an 18 percent share in GDP, wholesale and retail trade subsector posted&#13;
by 5 percent in              growth of 3.4 percent vis-Ã -vis 4 percent in FY2013/14 (see Table 2). This low&#13;
FY2014/15,                   growth was mostly due to a direct spillover effect of weak LSM and crop&#13;
compensating for the         performance in the outgoing fiscal year. Similarly, transport, storage and&#13;
low growth in                communication grew by 4.2 percent in FY2014/15 compared to 4.6 percent in&#13;
agriculture and              previous year mostly due to slowdown in communications while air transport and&#13;
industry.                    railways continued to grow steadily6. Growth in the services sector came from&#13;
                             finance and insurance (6.2 percent, compared to 4.2 percent in the previous year)&#13;
                             and general government services (9.4 percent compared to 2.9 percent in&#13;
                             FY2013/14), on account of an increase in infrastructure spending and wages.&#13;

               II.      Fiscal Policy&#13;
                                 Fiscal Consolidation Remains on Track for the Second Consecutive Year&#13;
Fiscal consolidation         The overall deficit for FY2014/15 turned out to be 5.3 percent of GDP, 0.3&#13;
continues, albeit at a       percentage points higher than the revised estimates, owing to provincial increased&#13;
slower pace than             spending as well as tax revenue shortfalls. Nonetheless, the budget deficit declined&#13;
anticipated.                 slightly from 5.6 percent of GDP observed in the previous fiscal year. The past two&#13;
                             years have been a break from the past four years (FY2009/10-FY2012/13) when&#13;
                             the fiscal deficit has hovered above 6 percent of GDP7 (see Figure 4). This break&#13;
                             has been a result of government efforts in tightening fiscal policy.&#13;

                             operational efficiency was improved.&#13;
                             7 For FY2011/12, the deficit was a high as 8.8 percent of GDP.&#13;

FBR taxes continue            The budget target for tax revenues â&#128;&#147; 86 percent of total revenues â&#128;&#147; for FY2014/15&#13;
to experience                 was set at PKR 2,810 billion, which was revised downward during the year.&#13;
shortfall.                    Provisional data points to a collection of PKR 2,594 billion â&#128;&#147; PKR 11 billion lower&#13;
                              than the last revised estimate of PKR 2,605 billion â&#128;&#147; on account of FBR revenues,&#13;
                              recording an annual growth of 14.2 percent viz.-a-viz. collection in the previous&#13;
                              year8. Weak performance of sales tax (with 42 percent share in FBR taxes) as well as&#13;
                              direct taxes (40 percent share) appears to be the reason behind this moderate&#13;
                              growth (see Table 3). The underlying factors have been the decline in oil prices,&#13;
                              historical low inflation, sluggish LSM sector activity as well as non-implementation&#13;
                              of some revenue measures introduced at the time of budget that were challenged in&#13;
                              court9. Consequently, in order to compensate for the shortfall resulting from these&#13;
                              developments, the government implemented a number of additional tax measures10&#13;
                              during the course of the year. These additional measures have been able to only&#13;
                              partially compensate for the shortfall in tax revenue. Despite these headwinds, the&#13;
                              tax-to-GDP ratio increased from 10.5 percent in FY2013/14 to 11.0 percent in&#13;
                              FY2014/15 â&#128;&#147; the increase coming from the federal government only. This has been&#13;
                              possible due to some progress towards improving the efficiency and effectiveness of&#13;
                              tax administration as well as phasing out of Statuary Regulatory Order (SRO) related&#13;
                              exemptions.&#13;

                              8 Last year, the growth was 17.4 percent.&#13;
                              9 These measures included 5 percent income tax on bonus shares and Gas Infrastructure&#13;
                              Development Cess (GIDC). The GIDC bill was only approved by the end of fiscal year, on&#13;
                              May 22, 2015. The bill will not only authorize the government to continue collecting the&#13;
                              GIDC, but will also provide retroactive legalization to the GIDC the government has been&#13;
                              collecting since 2011.&#13;
                              10 These included raising GST rate on petroleum products from 17 percent to 22 percent&#13;
&#13;
                              and then to 27 percent, levying regulatory duties of 10 percent on imports of more than 300&#13;

Non-tax revenues                  Normalization of interest receipts from SOEs as well as lower energy-related&#13;
declined compared                 proceeds contributed to a 7.7 percent decline in non-tax revenues in FY2014/15,&#13;
to FY2013/14. They                recorded at PKR 913 billion (see Table 4). Last year, the circular debt settlement&#13;
were nonetheless                  increased the revenues generated by SOEs considerably and thus, this year â&#128;&#147;&#13;
higher than                       without any such development â&#128;&#147; the revenues from SOEs reverted to its past&#13;
budgeted, on                      normal trend. Moreover, collection in FY2013/14 was unusually high due to&#13;
account of healthy                another one-off inflow from Universal Access Fund of the Telecommunication&#13;
central bank profits              Ministry. In the outgoing fiscal year, the highlight has been the SBP profits that&#13;
as well as CSF                    were to the tune of almost PKR 400 billion, 22 percent higher than those booked&#13;
monies.                           the previous year, mainly on account of successful divestment of government shares&#13;
                                  in commercial banks11. Moreover, defense receipts due to CSF12 proceeds were&#13;
                                  impressive and amounted to PKR 157 billion. Additionally, provinces showed&#13;
                                  notable effort towards non-tax revenue and collected PKR 76 billion in aggregate,&#13;

This time, unlike the             An increased spending role after the 18th Constitutional Amendment (see special&#13;

provinces did not                 FY2014/15 for provincial recurrent spending, significantly higher than the 7.1&#13;
contribute to fiscal              percent growth witnessed the previous year. Similarly, provincial development&#13;
consolidation efforts             expenditures increased to PKR 499 billion from PKR 431 billion in the previous&#13;
of the federal                    year, growing by almost 16 percent. As a result, provinces posted a small combined&#13;
government.                       deficit of PKR 9.8 billion (or 0.04 percent of GDP) for FY2014/15 contrary to&#13;
                                  revised estimates that projected a surplus to the order of 0.5 percent of GDP.&#13;

                                              As a Result of Continued Fiscal Consolidation, Public Debt Dynamics&#13;

Total public debt                         As of end-June 2015, total public debt stood at 64.6 percent of GDP15 as compared&#13;
marginally declined                       to the June 30, 2014 stock position of 64.9 percent (see Figure 5). In terms of its&#13;
over the course of                        composition, domestic debt dominated the stock in line with the past trend. In fact,&#13;
the year.                                 foreign currency public debt declined by 1.3 percentage points during the year and&#13;
                                          closed FY2014/15 at 19.1 percent of GDP despite healthy IFI disbursements,&#13;
                                          continued IMF program and successful launch of international Sukuk. This is&#13;
                                          primarily due to translational gain16 observed during most of the fiscal year.&#13;

long-term and short-                      recorded an increase of PKR 1.3 trillion in the portfolio, thereby closing FY2014/15&#13;

                                          disbursements are effectively converted into PKR. As PKR is not an internationally traded&#13;
                                          currency, other currencies are bought and sold via selling and buying of USD. Hence, the&#13;
                                          currency exposure of foreign debt originates from two sources: USD/other foreign&#13;

percent of GDP in               percent in FY2013/14. Imports also declined mainly due to lower international oil&#13;
FY2014/15 compared              and commodity prices (see Table 6). Nevertheless, trade deficit widened in absolute&#13;

The demand for non-             Imports witnessed a decline of 0.9 percent during FY2014/15 against 3.8 percent&#13;
oil imports in                  growth in previous year. This contraction was primarily due to declining petroleum&#13;
response to relatively          group import bill â&#128;&#147; which declined by 17.8 percent (US $ 2.6 billion) during&#13;

                                           products. Overall decline in value of textile exports (by 1.0 percent) is mainly on&#13;
                                           account of decrease in low value added exports which declined by 9.8 percent due&#13;

                                           26 China is faced with lower exports of its high value added products due to lower demand&#13;
                                           and recession in EU, therefore suppressing exports from Pakistan. Similarly Bangladesh is&#13;
                                           also faced with lower exports to US and supply chain issues which resultantly led to lower&#13;

&#13;
                                           particularly skilled and qualified workers, (ii) enforcement of anti-money laundering&#13;
                                           legislation and (iii) implementation of Pakistan remittance initiatives (PRI) by the banking&#13;

                                    countries, which contributes only 2 percent in total remittance and hence have a&#13;
                                    negligible impact on overall volume and growth of remittances. The share of Saudi&#13;
                                    Arabia in overall remittances was the largest (31 percent); with the United Arab&#13;
                                    Emirates (23 percent), the United States (14 percent) and United Kingdom (12&#13;

                                    oil prices could affect remittances by affecting economic growth in oil producing&#13;

Reserves buildup                                 The PKR remained largely stable with a small depreciation of about 3.0 percent&#13;
continued to ease                                against the US$ during FY2014/15. A stable nominal exchange rate and sharply&#13;
forex market                                     falling inflation resulted in REER appreciating by 7.9 percent during the period&#13;

                                                        Higher Budgetary Borrowing remains a Leading Factor behind Monetary&#13;

Improved                                         Strong workersâ&#128;&#153; remittance and CSF flows, and declining international oil prices&#13;
macroeconomic                                    helped contain current account deficit to 0.8 percent of GDP. This coupled with&#13;
indicators allowed                               substantial inflows in capital and financial accounts resulted in a buildup in SBPâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
SBP to ease its                                  reserves thereby infusing stability in the foreign exchange market. As a result, the&#13;
monetary policy                                  PKR remained stable with a small depreciation of 3.3 percent against the US$&#13;
stance aggressively                              during the year. The stability in PKR and the government decision to pass-on the&#13;
during FY2014/15.                                benefit of falling international oil prices eased inflation considerably. All this allowed&#13;
                                                 SBP to ease monetary policy through a cumulatively cut of its policy rate by 350 bps&#13;

&amp;#12;                            in FY2014/15.31&#13;
&#13;
Movement in                 While reserve money growth decelerated for the third year in a row to 9.9 percent in&#13;
monetary aggregates         FY2014/15, broad money supply grew by 13.2 percent in FY2014/15, compared&#13;
were largely dictated       with 12.5 percent in FY2013/14. The behavior of reserve money was primarily&#13;
by targets set in the       influenced by measures to limit government borrowing from SBP. This, along with&#13;
governmentâ&#128;&#153;s reform         the outright sale of government securities to commercial banks, allowed the SBP to&#13;
program agreed with         limit growth of net domestic assets (NDA) for all quarters of the year. While these&#13;
the IMF.                    measures have constrained growth in NDA, overall positive external balance&#13;
                            allowed net foreign assets (NFA) of central bank to expand, albeit slower than in&#13;
                            FY2013/14 (see Table 7). The current account balance narrowed slightly during&#13;
                            FY2014/15; but limited FDI and capital and financial inflows led to a deceleration&#13;
                            of NFA growth during the year, particularly with regards to the central bank.&#13;
&#13;
Broad money growth          This is reflected in strong expansion in NDA of banking system which grew by 11.7&#13;
was fundamentally           percent as compared to 9.1 percent in FY2013/14 (see Table 7). Although&#13;
driven by the               expansion in NDA is in line with the monetary easing during the year, a significant&#13;
government sector           part of this growth came from the government sector instead of private sector. In&#13;
borrowing for               absolute term, the government borrowed PKR 861.0 billion for budgetary finance&#13;
budgetary support           from the banking system in FY2014/15, compared with PKR 303.0 billion in&#13;
and commodity               FY2013/14. Within the banking system, the government heavily relied on&#13;
operations.                 commercial banks not only to finance its budget deficit, but also to retire some of its&#13;
                            borrowing from SBP. In addition, in a declining interest rate environment, banks&#13;
                            were also keen to lock-in their funds in high yielding assets. As a result of this&#13;
                            demand-supply dynamics, net government borrowing from commercial banks&#13;
                            expanded by PKR 1,335 billion in FY2014/15 compared with only PKR 106.1&#13;
                            billion in FY2013/14.32&#13;

Despite this easing,         The government, as part of its economic reform program with the IMF, limited&#13;
overall market               borrowing from the central bank, and instead resorted to increased borrowing from&#13;

Slow credit off-take         Out of overall private sector credit, private businesses borrowed PKR 180 billion&#13;

in private sector.           13 percent in FY2013/14. On the other hand, construction and ship breaking&#13;
                             sectors registered an uptake in credit.&#13;

Inflationary pressure             The average Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation steadily declined by around 4&#13;
substantially eased               percentage points and reached 4.5 percent, its lowest level in a decade and well&#13;
during FY2014/15.                 below its previous level of 8.6 percent in preceding year and annual target of 8.0&#13;
                                  percent (see Figure 14). Similarly, year-on-year inflation exhibited a sharp fall&#13;
                                  particular from October 2014 onward mainly due to fall in global oil price, which&#13;
                                  was duly passed on to domestic consumers, and lower food prices (see Figure 15).&#13;
                                  Specifically, during Q1-FY2014/15, year-on-year inflation declined only marginally&#13;
                                  from the 8.2 percent to 7.7 percent by September 2014; after that it decelerated&#13;
                                  sharply in subsequent months and reached 2.1 percent in April 2014. Since then, it&#13;
                                  inched up slightly to 3.2 till June 2015.36&#13;

Economic growth               The outlook for Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s economy is supported by relatively low inflation,&#13;
is expected to                particularly low oil prices, and continuous fiscal consolidation. Reforms are&#13;
accelerate slightly           expected to continue and support easing of energy constraints and improvements&#13;
over the next two             in the economyâ&#128;&#153;s competitiveness. Nonetheless, this outlook is subject to&#13;
years as                      substantial external and domestic risks. Investment levels remain low given weak&#13;
macroeconomic                 investorsâ&#128;&#153; confidence. Removing infrastructure bottlenecks, especially in energy,&#13;
indicators improve            will be crucial to accelerate growth and its long-term sustainability. Security&#13;
and the reform                situation, though improved, still affects growth prospects negatively.&#13;

4.5 percent in                which comprises more than half of the economy. Agriculture sector, which is one-&#13;
FY2015/16, reaching           fifth of the economy, is expected to grow at about 3 percent in FY2015/16 (see&#13;
4.8 percent in                Figure 22). Given forward linkages of the agricultural sector, improved&#13;

                              industrial sector is expected to grow at 4.4 percent, lower than the official target of&#13;
                              6.4 percent. Services, which has been a main stay for growth in the last few years, is&#13;
                              expected to grow at about 5.2 percent in FY2015/16.&#13;

Fiscal consolidation         Fiscal consolidation is projected to continue over the medium term on the&#13;

                             SOEs. Resultantly, the fiscal deficit (including grants) is expected to decline to 4.2&#13;
                             percent of GDP in FY2015/16 and to 3.5 percent in the subsequent fiscal year.&#13;
                             Accordingly, reduced deficit financing will facilitate provision of bank credit to the&#13;
                             private sector, leading to increased economic activity.&#13;

Under the baseline           In the short to medium run, inflationary pressures are expected to remain subdued.&#13;
scenario, inflationary       It is expected that inflation would remain around 4-5 percent as international&#13;

                             indicates lower inflationary expectations for the months ahead). The 1.8 percent&#13;
                             YoY monthly inflation in July, 2015 (the lowest since August, 2003) is the&#13;
                             continuation of the declining trend in CPI inflation in FY2015/16 as well.&#13;
                             However, the supply disruption of perishable food items due to seasonal floods and&#13;
                             a possible hike in the electricity and gas tariffs by the government pose up-side risks.&#13;
                             In addition, recent monetary easing may result in higher aggregate demand which&#13;
                             may also result in inflation uptick.&#13;
                       II.        Risks to the Outlook&#13;
Recent slowdown in           Recent slowdown in China and a weak recovery in the EU may have direct and&#13;
China and weak               indirect impact on Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s exports. First is the direct impact on trade, stemming&#13;
recovery in the EU           from both demand effects and exchange rate effects. China constitutes 10 percent&#13;
represent to have            of Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s exports (roughly US $2.2 billion). Competitiveness of the textiles&#13;

for external side.           appreciation of the real effective exchange rate and compensate for slight&#13;
                             improvements in competitiveness otherwise. Remittances are expected to remain at&#13;
                             current high levels, but a further weakening of prices may negatively oil-producing&#13;
                             countries where a large share of the remittances originate.&#13;
&#13;
Underperformance             On the fiscal side, realization of tax revenue targets largely hinges upon the steady&#13;
in revenue collection        implementation of the tax reform agenda. Fiscal consolidation may also be&#13;
may pose downside            negatively affected by delayed implementation of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s privatization&#13;
risk to fiscal               agenda. Public sector investment is expected to increase as a result of official&#13;
consolidation.               Chinese government support to the CPEC. Should the slowdown in China affect&#13;
                             the level of this support, public investment may be negatively affected. Deviation&#13;
                             from targeted budget deficits may force government to increase its financing from&#13;
                             commercial banks which may continue to crowd out private sector credit.&#13;

&amp;#12;                C. Progress on Structural Reforms&#13;
After a strong focus      Over the past two years, Pakistan has successfully implemented an economic reform&#13;
on macroeconomic          agenda with a strong focus on achieving external and internal balance. Aided by a&#13;
stability over the past   narrowing current account and strong external financial inflows, the external&#13;
two years â&#128;&#147; Pakistan      balance has been positive over the past two years and international reserves have&#13;
needs to continue         steadily increased to reach over 3 months of imports. The fiscal deficits have also&#13;
making progress in        declined â&#128;&#147; although by less than programmed, and debt levels are now in a&#13;
the structural            downward trajectory. Growth has also accelerated, but it remains well below&#13;
reforms agenda.           potential at 4.2 percent in FY2014/15. Investment remains low, and more&#13;
                          worryingly private sector investment has declined as a share of GDP over the past&#13;
                          few years. It will be important for the country to now focus on a reform agenda that&#13;
                          accelerates growth and investment and ensures its sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
The government            Reforming the energy sector continues to be a top priority as the private sector&#13;
continues with its        continues to be plagued by power outages. The poor performance of the energy&#13;
ambitious reform          sector also inhibits much needed private sector investment in the sector and&#13;
agenda in the energy      generates significant fiscal outlays, in the form of energy subsidies and the&#13;
sector.                   accumulation of circular debt that will ultimately have to be financed through the&#13;
                          budget. The reform program is laid out in the new energy policy approved in July&#13;
                          2013. The policy foresees (i) adoption of a new tariff pricing formula, (ii) improved&#13;
                          operating efficiency and reduced losses within power distribution companies, (iii)&#13;
                          increased efforts to attract private sector investment to the sector, including the&#13;
                          privatization of a number of companies (both distribution and generation). In the&#13;
                          past year, the Government has implemented surcharges and adjusted prices with the&#13;
                          objective of achieving full cost recovery from consumers. The Government has also&#13;
                          developed a mechanism to monitor the accumulation of arrears in the sector&#13;
                          (circular debt) and adopted a plan for reducing the accumulation of arrears. This&#13;
                          plan includes the improvement of collections and reduction of operation costs and&#13;
                          losses (through revenue-based load management) and adoption of performance&#13;
                          contracts to improve management of the distribution companies. The Government&#13;
                          is also implementing a number of demand-side measures with regards to pricing,&#13;
                          metering-infrastructure and adoption of equipment standards for improved energy&#13;
                          efficiency and conservation. On the supply-side, the Government is improving the&#13;
                          fuel-mix in electricity generation, continues to invest and attract investment in&#13;
                          generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure. There are a number of large&#13;
                          investments planned in the energy sector over the next few years (including through&#13;
                          the CPEC) that will add significant generation capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Increasing tax            Pakistan has one of the lowest tax to GDP ratios in the world. The Government&#13;
revenues remains          adopted relatively ambitious targets to increase revenues from below 10 percent to&#13;
high on the               14 percent in only five years. The reform is laid out in the tax reform strategy&#13;
governmentâ&#128;&#153;s reform       adopted in February 2014 and a 3-year plan for phasing out SRO-based tax&#13;
agenda â&#128;&#147; and despite      exemptions in July 2014. The Government has started to implement this ambitious&#13;
significant revenue       reform agenda, including the elimination of a large number of SRO-based&#13;
growth performance        exemptions and the authority to grant tax concessions or exemptions has now been&#13;
continues to be           transferred to parliament. The Government is also implementing a series of&#13;
below targets.            measures to automatize and streamline business processes, enhance tax&#13;
                          administration through broadening the tax base and improving compliance,&#13;
                          enforcement and market analysis. At the same time as broadening the tax base, the&#13;
                          Government is also increasing efforts to improve governance and reduce corruption&#13;
                          in tax administration. With the devolution of authority over a number of taxes to&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                            25&#13;
&amp;#12;                       the provincial level, it is becoming increasingly important to enhance capacity at the&#13;
                       provincial level. Provinces have now authority over services sales taxes, property&#13;
                       taxes and agricultural income taxes, all taxes with significant revenue potential which&#13;
                       is currently not being exploited. Despite these efforts â&#128;&#147; tax collection continues to&#13;
                       be below targets, suggesting the need to maintain the focus on this reform area and&#13;
                       to accelerate efforts as appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
Private investment     Despite a more stable macroeconomic environment and government broader&#13;
continues to be very   efforts to attract investment, private investment is now on a declining trend, falling&#13;
low â&#128;&#147; and more         below 10 percent of GDP in FY2014/15. FDI is also on a declining trend, and at&#13;
worryingly seems to    0.3 percent of GDP is the lowest in a decade and among the lowest in South Asia&#13;
be on a declining      (for a discussion on the reasons for such low levels of FDI and investment more&#13;
trend.                 broadly see special section I). To reverse this trend, the Government of Pakistan&#13;
                       adopted in October 2014 a plan to improve the investment climate. The reform&#13;
                       plan covers a broad range of issues to improve the investment climate, including&#13;
                       measures to improve (i) business start-up and registration, (ii) dealing with&#13;
                       construction permits, (iii) accessing credits, (iv) tax administration, (v) trade&#13;
                       facilitation, and (vi) contract enforcement. The Government has implemented a&#13;
                       series of reforms over the past few years, including the establishment of one-stop-&#13;
                       shops, started the implementation of a comprehensive tariff reform to improve&#13;
                       trade competitiveness and the preparation and adoption of a financial inclusion&#13;
                       strategy in early 2015, which includes the preparation and passing of a number of&#13;
                       key laws including the Credit Bureau Act, the Secured Transactions Law and the&#13;
                       Deposit Protection Fund. A number of reforms are under the responsibility of&#13;
                       provincial authorities. To improve the business environment at the subnational&#13;
                       level, the Federal Government is enhancing coordination with provinces and&#13;
                       developing province-level implementation plans to improve the business&#13;
                       environment.&#13;

                        I.      Why Investment is Low in Pakistan?&#13;
Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s                            Pakistan has immense potential for profitable investments, considering its strategic&#13;
investment to GDP                     location and prospective market size. Despite this potential, the investment-to-GDP&#13;
ratio is low and                      ratio has consistently remained lower than other economies in the region; more&#13;
declining.                            troubling is the declining trend of this ratio in recent years that reached a 35-year&#13;
                                      low by end FY2013/14 (See Figures 23). Persistently low level of investments has&#13;
                                      constrained growth potential. Hence, whenever the economy experienced demand-&#13;
                                      driven boosts, macro-economic imbalances emerged in the form of inflation, higher&#13;
                                      imports and current account deficits. This section discusses some of the reasons&#13;
                                      behind chronically low investment rates in Pakistan.&#13;

                             PKR 309 billion on the same year. Another implication of high fiscal deficit is its&#13;

A relatively shallow            Banking sector deposit to GDP is about 32 percent at end June 2014. Most of these&#13;
financial market is             deposits are of shorter maturity (Table 11) creating a mismatch between commercial&#13;
unable to fulfill long          banks assets and liabilities. This clearly hampers the ability of banks to advance&#13;

needs.                          addition, private corporate debt market is in its early stages with very few companies&#13;
                                able to issue long term certificates to finance new investments or expansions. Out&#13;
                                of total 122 listed term finance certificates up till end February 2015, only 20 are&#13;
                                outstanding so far. A total of PKR 135 billion were raised of which PKR 30 billion&#13;
                                is outstanding. With this limited success, investors have limited options to finance&#13;
                                long term investments.&#13;

                          management skills to the operation of infrastructure services. Table 12 below shows&#13;
                          that Pakistan has a relatively small number of projects where it successfully reached&#13;
                          financial closure. In terms of amount, Pakistan attracted about US$ 35 billion in&#13;
                          PPP compared to US$ 338 billion by India and about US$ 500 billion in Brazil over&#13;
                          the past 25 years. Not only is Pakistan quite behind other emerging economies in&#13;
                          terms of number of projects; but more importantly, the distribution is skewed&#13;
                          towards one sector. A major reason for low private participation in Pakistan has&#13;
                          been due to a weak legal framework, which outlines the modus operandi of private&#13;
                          sector involvement in financing and operating infrastructure facilities.42 The&#13;
                          provinces are seeking to fill this void, with Sindh and Baluchistan provincial&#13;

Lack of coherent and      Inconsistencies in policies for different sectors over time have dented investorsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
consistent industrial     confidence. Incidents like the Independent Power Producers-Government stand-&#13;
and trade policies are    off in the late 1990s; litigation over Reko Diq mining lease; contract enforcement&#13;
impeding investorsâ&#128;&#153;       issues with Engro Fertilizer; and, frequent changes in Compressed Natural Gas&#13;
confidence.               (CNG) policy have affected the interest of potential investors in Pakistan.&#13;
                          Government capacity in terms of designing and analyzing investment agreements,&#13;
                          including in terms of forecasting demand and supply, needs strengthening.&#13;
                          Investments that need uninterrupted gas supplies (e.g. fertilizer) are now facing&#13;
                          operational constraints given gas shortages. The lack of coherence in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                          trade and industrial policies has also played a key role in reducing industrial&#13;
                          investments. More specifically, tariff policies have not been supplemented by a&#13;
                          comprehensive industrial strategy to improve the competitiveness of local firms.&#13;
                          Entry in some sectors is difficult. Burki (2008) observed that industrial policies were&#13;
                          made either as part of medium-term development plans or in response to some&#13;
                          crisis the country was facing. He states that, â&#128;&#156;the frequent changes in industrial&#13;
                          policy have kept the industrial sector relatively backward compared to the&#13;
                          developments in other large Asian economiesâ&#128;?.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                          42 Financing infrastructure and development projects in Pakistan has over the years been&#13;
                          made directly from budget allocations; therefore there is a lack of institutional and regulatory&#13;
                          capacity, which is necessary to facilitate private participation in infrastructure provision.&#13;

available elsewhere.       FDI is also highly concentrated in a small number of sectors and countries of origin.&#13;
                           In the last 15 years almost 60 percent of FDI went to three sectors: oil and gas&#13;
                           exploration, communications and financial business. Such high concentration means&#13;
                           that negative developments in these sectors can have a disproportionate impact on&#13;
                           overall FDI, e.g. the law and order situation in the exploration areas has deterred&#13;
                           FDI in oil and gas exploration45 which has dragged down overall FDI in the&#13;
                           country. In terms of sources of FDI, the US, UK and UAE jointly contribute on&#13;
                           average 60 percent of total FDI making Pakistan highly vulnerable to economic&#13;
                           conditions or changing perceptions of investors in these countries.&#13;

Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s share in        The Inward FDI Performance Index46 measures the amount of FDI that countries&#13;
overall global             receive relative to the size of their economy (GDP). A value greater than 1 suggests&#13;
investment flow is         that the economy has received more FDI relative to its economic size, while a value&#13;
low and falling.           below 1 suggests that it has received less FDI. The inward FDI performance index&#13;
                           for Pakistan suggests that over the years, the country has lost momentum in&#13;
                           attracting FDI. In contrast, some other countries in the group have either stabilized&#13;
                           or improved (see Table 13). Initially, the fall in FDI flows to Pakistan was&#13;
                           considered to be in line with global trends as most of the countries in the region&#13;
                           were facing similar declines. However, while the FDI flows to a number of peer&#13;
                           countries have stabilized or resumed recently, they continued to fall for Pakistan.&#13;

investment horizon? Government reform efforts in privatization, removal of energy bottle necks, and&#13;
                     simplifying and making tax laws more transparent are all steps in the right direction.&#13;
                     But perhaps more needs to be done to revive overall investment activity especially&#13;
                     FDI. Just facilitating foreign investors without making efforts to revive domestic&#13;
                     investment may not yield the desired results. It will be unrealistic to expect foreign&#13;
                     businesses to invest in Pakistan when its own private sector is not investing. This&#13;
                     regime should ideally be designed in such a manner that motivates and induces&#13;
                     industries to invest, innovate and reinvest. Improvements in the investment climate&#13;
                     will also need public investments in infrastructure and improved logistics.&#13;

&amp;#12;                    II. Fiscal Decentralization in Pakistan: Progress and Challenges&#13;
The 18th                   Amongst other political reforms, the amendment sought to increase provincial&#13;
Amendment                  autonomy and restore the fiscal relationship between the center and provinces. It&#13;
promulgated in 2010        abolished the Concurrent List of Legislation (CLL)47 and reassigned the functions to&#13;
is viewed as the most      provincial governments (except electricity) and also made changes in the Federal&#13;
comprehensive              Legislative List (FLL)48 with a view to increase provincial influence. Resultantly, the&#13;
attempt at                 provinces gained complete control over all public services within their jurisdiction&#13;
constitutional reform      and control over all local government institutions. The center mostly retained&#13;
since the 1973             functions relating to natural resources, electricity, communications, and regulatory&#13;
Constitution was           frameworks and cross border relationships of trade and finance.&#13;
adopted by Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
The Amendment and          For one, provinces were given authority over sales tax on services, considered to be&#13;
the 7th NFC Award          a dynamic and buoyant tax (estimates for Pakistan suggest it could yield revenues of&#13;
that preceded it also      0.5 percent to 1.0 percent of the GDP). In addition other taxes such as those on&#13;
sought to expand the       immovable property, estate and inheritance, and zakat and usher (religious taxes)&#13;
resource envelope of       were reverted back to the provinces. The NFC Award of 2009 was also considered a&#13;
the provinces in           significant milestone in terms of altering the distribution of resources between the&#13;
order to respond to        center and the provinces. It broke from the past and introduced a multifactor&#13;
the larger service         formula that included not just population share but also poverty, inverse population&#13;
delivery mandate.          density and provincial tax effort. Overall share of the provinces was also increased&#13;
                           from 47.5 percent to 56 percent in the first year of NFC Award (2010/11) and 57.5&#13;

Committee (IC) set         were to be devolved to the provinces, re-allocated within the Federal government,&#13;
up at the Federal          or abolished as a result of this process. Of these, 103 functions ended up being&#13;
level comprising of        devolved, while other were abolished or retained at the Federal level. Seventeen&#13;
members of                 Federal ministries/divisions, mostly relating to social sectors were abolished while&#13;
Parliament                 eight new ministries/divisions were created to manage retained functions in&#13;
representing the           devolved subjects (SPDC 2012).50 The reforms affected functions of 61,000&#13;
leading political          Federal employees of which approximately 15,000 were transferred to the provinces&#13;

and 18th                delivery by increasing the agency of provincial governments in determining&#13;
Constitutional          development priorities and raising revenues. A review of fiscal trends at the&#13;
Amendment aimed         provincial level reveals that some progress is being made towards realizing the goals&#13;
to strengthen the       of decentralization. However issues of political economy and capacity continue to&#13;

Post 18th               have been shared with the provinces (see Figure 27) when compared to a&#13;
Amendment Period.       continuation of the 6th NFC Award. To understand whether this increase in&#13;
                        resources translated into achieving decentralization objectives, it needs to be looked&#13;
                        into where these additional funds went.&#13;
&#13;
Analysis of             In the period 2010/11 to 2014/15, growth in recurrent expenditure was 27 percent&#13;
provincial finances     whereas development expenditure grew at 15 percent in real terms. While there is&#13;
shows that the          need to increase the proportion of budget for development projects, it is&#13;
additional resource     encouraging to see a shift towards service delivery in development priorities of the&#13;
transfer to the         provinces in the post reform period.53 Social services now has the largest share in&#13;

towards higher          (such as transportation/construction and agriculture/irrigation). Moreover,&#13;
recurrent spending      provincial social service spending over the four years of 7th NFC Award have risen&#13;
rather than             by 45 percent.&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
On the revenue side,    This increase is largely driven by the reversion of GST on services to the provinces&#13;
provincial revenue      and thus does not translate into increasing the national resource pie. Provinces need&#13;
collection indicators   to focus on strengthening own revenue collection effort to contribute to expanding&#13;
&#13;
                        52 Which included increasing the vertical share of the province, increasing the divisible pool&#13;
                        pie, etc. (see section 1.4 of full policy note for details).&#13;
                        53 According to Global Competitiveness Report (GCR) 2014/15, quality of road infrastructure in&#13;

                        Pakistan is ranked at 75 out of 144 countries, while India is and Bangladesh are ranked at 76&#13;
                        and 117 respectively. Similarly for quality of port infrastructure indicator, Pakistan is ranked at 59&#13;
                        while India and Bangladesh are ranked at 76 and 93 respectively. However, Pakistan ranking&#13;
                        in social sector indicators drops in comparison to the regional peers. For example, infant&#13;
                        mortality indicators of GCR ranks Pakistan at 137 out of 144 countries compared to 115 and&#13;
                        104 ranking for India and Bangladesh respectively. On quality of education indicator, Pakistan is&#13;
                        ranked at 119 out of 144 countries compared to 88 and 108 ranking for India and&#13;
                        Bangladesh. For infant mortality indicators, Pakistan is ranked at 137 out of 144 countries&#13;
                        compared to 115 and 104 ranking for India and Bangladesh.&#13;

                         54 This decline has been attributed not to any structural improvements in the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                         finances but rather due to higher revenues from one off inflows and non-settlement of the&#13;

&amp;#12;                III. Some Stylized Facts of Pakistan Economic Growth&#13;
Pakistan low             This section explores stylized facts of Pakistanâ&#128;&#153; growth patterns. The analysis&#13;
investment will place    suggests that Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s economic growth has been a story of scarce growth spurts&#13;
it at a disadvantaged    and declining long run trend in growth potential. Using a growth accounting&#13;
position among peer      framework, it also analyzes the role factor accumulation and technological progress&#13;
countries going          over the long term.&#13;
forward.&#13;
&#13;
An economy which         Since independence Pakistan economy has been characterized by both high growth&#13;
is unable to sustain     episodes as well as economic downturns. The 1960s, 1980s and the period of 1999-&#13;
longer period of high    2005 are characterized as high growth episodes while 1970s, 1990s and the period of&#13;
growth.                  2006-2011 experienced low growth. The average growth rate during high growth&#13;
                         episodes was 6.7 percent while it remained around 3 percent during low growth&#13;
                         periods56 (see Table 19). Over the past few years, the economy has shown some&#13;
                         recovery but still growing below 5 percent. Generally the periods of relatively strong&#13;
                         growth tend to be associated with increased investment and trade, real exchange rate&#13;
                         depreciations, and with political stability57. Moreover, high levels of external aid and&#13;
                         ability to push through reforms also contributed to growth spurts. As the economy&#13;
                         has a very low domestic saving rate (as percentage to GDP)58, Pakistan has&#13;
                         remained dependent on foreign saving inflows to sustain its investments.&#13;
&#13;
The economyâ&#128;&#153;s            On average, the economy grew at an average annual rate of slightly above 5&#13;
growth pattern is full   percent59 during the last six decades and few impressive high growth episodes with&#13;
of short cycles of       an average of around 7 percent. However, these episodes tends not to be sustained&#13;
rapid growth             (see Table 19). For instance, since 1962, there have been only two periods where&#13;
followed by              growth consistently remained above 5 percent per annum for more than 4 years.&#13;
stagnation.              Hence, episodes of robust growth are frequent, but not sustained. This is not the&#13;
                         case in many comparable countries in the region such as India, China, Malaysia and&#13;
                         South Korea, which have all managed to grow at relatively high rates for a&#13;
                         considerable period of time. In contrast, Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s economic growth is&#13;
                         characterized as less volatile. Over the last five decades, the volatility of its GDP&#13;
                         growth, as measured by the standard deviation of the growth rate of real GDP, was&#13;
                         2.1 percent; near about the average in South East Asia60. However, this has been&#13;
                         increasing in recent times, rising from 1.4 in the 1980s to 2.5 in the 2000s.&#13;

                         56 High growth is assumed to be greater than 5 percent per annum.&#13;
                         57 Haussmann, Pritchett and Rodrik (2004) define growth accelerations as periods with an&#13;
                         increase of GDP per-capita growth of 2 percentage points or more for at least 8 years.&#13;
                         Accounting for population dynamics, in Pakistan such a figure would be roughly equivalent&#13;
                         to GDP growth of at least 5 percent.&#13;

Agriculture sector          Although agriculture contribution to GDP has gradually halved its share of GDP&#13;
has strong influence        from 47 percent in 1960 to 21 percent in 2015, Figure 29 shows the existence of a&#13;
on overall growth           high correlation between real GDP and real agricultural GDPâ&#128;&#148;even though such&#13;
performance due to          correlation weakens in the 2000s from 80 percent to 35 percent till 2015, whereas&#13;

sectors.                    Political uncertainty and natural disasters have also contributed to growth&#13;
                            slowdown. Looking closely at Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s economic history, above average growth&#13;
                            rates in the 1960s and 1980s coincided with episodes of reform and economic and&#13;
                            political stability along with high levels of external aid. In contrast, during the 1970s&#13;
                            and 1990s, political disruption, economic uncertainty and regional tensions were&#13;
                            accompanied by few or incomplete reforms and, toward the end of the 1990s,&#13;
                            macroeconomic instability and the resulting inability of policymakers to implement&#13;
                            and sustain policies necessary for growth and poverty reduction. In addition, natural&#13;
                            disasters have taken their toll and explain a few episodes of growth deceleration.&#13;
                            This is certainly the case of the late 2000sâ&#128;&#148;a period that witnessed four natural&#13;

                         capitalâ&#128;&#153;s contribution in output per worker has improved. TFP contribution has also&#13;
                         been relevant, but dramatically declining to about half from 1980s to 2000s.&#13;
                         However, these have recovered in last 5 years to 1.3 percent on average still below&#13;
                         medium-term average of 2.0 in East Asia67. Productivity has increased the most in&#13;
                         the services sector, led by a significant improvement in productivity in the past five&#13;
                         years (Table 20).&#13;
&#13;
Contribution of total    Literature identified several factors contributed to the low TFP in Pakistan&#13;
factor productivity in   compared to many of its peer countries. The underlying factor have been the overall&#13;
overall labor            macroeconomic environment, financial developments, limited FDI and human&#13;
productivity is low,     capital and technological developments. Evidence indicates that TFP growth in&#13;
compared to peer         Pakistan was particularly strong in periods where the macroeconomic environment&#13;
countries.               improved and political stability ensued68. Low levels of science and technological&#13;
                         growth also appeared to be closely correlated with low TFP growth69. There is also&#13;
                         evidence from literature that the TFP decline in 1990s was a result of&#13;
                         macroeconomic factors70 whereby the need to curtail the fiscal deficit was mainly&#13;
                         done through cutting development expenditure and social sector expenditures,&#13;
                         which negatively affected human capital. The above mentioned results are&#13;
                         consistent with literature, which highlighting that high TFP growth is associated&#13;
                         with macroeconomic stability, high level of investments, low inflation and external&#13;
                         inflows.71 During 1980, a period of relatively high productivity growth, all sectors&#13;
                         benefitted from price stability, significant external inflows and the impact of large&#13;
                         investment made by public sector in 1970s72.&#13;
&#13;
More recently, lack      The recent low contribution of capital to productivity is in line with the overall low&#13;
of investment has        investment levels in the economy in the last 5 years. Labor productivity growth in&#13;
held back labor          recent years can also be associated with demographic transitions effects. Pakistan is&#13;

percent of GDP in       translating into a growth of about 4.4 percent. While the recurrent expenditures&#13;
total expenditures of   are set to contract by 0.6 percent viz-a-viz last year and reach PKR 3,166 billion by&#13;
the Federal             the end of the on-going fiscal year, a 28 percent increase in development outlay has&#13;
government from         been programmed amounting to a size of PKR 864 billion. In terms of GDP,&#13;
14.1 percent in         federal development expenditures are budgeted to increase from 2.0 percent of&#13;
FY2014/1575 to 13.1     GDP in FY2014/15 to 2.3 percent for the current fiscal year. Of this, more than 80&#13;
percent in              percent has been allocated under the budget 2015/16 Public Sector Development&#13;
FY2015/16.              Programme (PSDP). Another 12 percent comprises of the flagship cash transfer&#13;
                        programme (BISP) that falls outside the PSDP bracket. The remaining includes&#13;
                        fertilizer subsidy (traditionally parked under this head), lump sum provision of misc.&#13;
                        items, and some other items.&#13;
&#13;
There are structural    Given the rigid nature of non-development spending historically, the three top most&#13;
rigidities within       heads appear to be interest payments (with 40 percent share in total recurrent&#13;
recurrent budget.       expenditure), defense affairs (25 percent) and general administration â&#128;&#147; 14 percent&#13;
                        (see Figure 31). It is apparent that the increased security related spending&#13;
                        (manifested by an upsurge in budgeted spending for Defense and Law &amp; Order for&#13;
                        FY2015/16) has been accommodated by cutting the budget of general public&#13;
                        service. This is encouraging despite the 7.5 percent increase in public sector wage&#13;
                        bill announced in the Budget. Grants, mostly directed towards the SOEs, still appear&#13;
                        to be making 13 percent of the total recurrent spending despite governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                        commitment to move ahead with reforms to restructure the loss-making enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
Higher public           In the Budget speech, the Federal Minister for Finance alluded to concerted efforts&#13;
investment is           being made to attract private investment, in addition to increasing public&#13;
expected to crowd in    investment, through a variety of mechanisms such as promoting public private&#13;
private sector.         partnerships, FDI, and creating special economic zones with fiscal incentives. Key&#13;
                        priorities under the Federal annual development plan are listed below (see Table 21&#13;
                        and Figure 32). After infrastructure, rest of the categories appear to be shrinking&#13;
                        their allocations towards the PSDP primarily to make space for â&#128;&#152;New Programmesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
                        that has only been added to the development portfolio during the last fiscal year.&#13;

Infrastructure is one      Infrastructure is set to receive the highest â&#128;&#147; 55 percent â&#128;&#147; allocation with a budget of&#13;
on the biggest             PKR 386 billion. Within this sub-sector, highways together with power projects are&#13;
priority in the            expected to make up 70 percent of the total infrastructure allocation (see Figure&#13;
development budget.        33).&#13;

                           prominent in the current year plan with almost PKR 76 billion allocation.&#13;
                           Interestingly, out of the three motorway schemes, Multan-Sukkur Motorway worth&#13;
                           PKR 50 billion is the only approved project implying an expected speedy execution&#13;
                           of this road project. Additionally, operationalizing the Western and Northern&#13;
                           alignment of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) appears to be another&#13;
                           salient feature of this year, approximating to PKR 58 billion.&#13;

                             Jamshoro (PKR 20 billion)78. Inclusion of these projects point towards government&#13;
                             efforts to explore avenues other than the conventional fuel-based power generation.&#13;
                             Railways (PKR 41 billion), Water and Atomic Energy (PKR 30 billion each) sub-sectors are&#13;
                             tilted towards completion of on-going schemes. Importantly, CPEC-related railway&#13;
                             projects of about PKR 2 billion as well as Chasma Nuclear Power Project Unit&#13;
                             worth PKR 26 billion have also been planned for the current year. Moreover,&#13;
                             allocation for Ports &amp; Shipping has been increased by almost 4 times from PKR 2.6&#13;
                             billion last year to PKR 12 billion for FY2015/16 owing to construction of Gwadar&#13;
                             port under the first phase of CPEC.&#13;

Social and economic           Social Services: In Pakistan, the fiscal architecture has undergone a considerable&#13;
sector, too, received         shift post 18th Constitutional Amendment79, thereby devolving the social subjects&#13;
significant                   largely to the provinces. Nonetheless, higher education and curriculum development&#13;
allocations.                  remains the responsibility of Federal government. Higher Education Commission is set&#13;
                              to receive PKR 20.5 billion this year. Moreover, the Federal government continues&#13;
                              financing of vertical health programmes80,81. As these projects are approaching their&#13;
                              culminations, the allocation has declined over time (for instance, from PKR 28&#13;
                              billion last year to PKR 20 billion in the FY2015/16 Federal PSDP). Thus, the share&#13;
                              of social services sector in Federal PSDP is budgeted to fall from 10 percent in&#13;
                              FY2014/15 to 6 percent in FY2015/16 (or from PKR 58 billion to PKR 43.7&#13;
                              billion).&#13;

                              81 By passing the Award before the 18 th Amendment, the federal government violated the&#13;
&#13;
                              basic rule of decentralization sequencing i.e. â&#128;&#152;finance follows functionâ&#128;&#153;. As a result, the&#13;
                              provinces disassociated the transfer of responsibilities emanating from the 18 th Amendment&#13;
                              from the additional resources allocated under the 7 th NFC Award. The federal government&#13;
                              thus ended up retaining several big ticket vertical programs within the devolved subjects,&#13;
                              which continue to command a significant share of the federal PSDP. This squeeze is likely to&#13;
                              continue as the next NFC Award appears to be delayed by at least a year and the 2015/16&#13;
                              federal budget has been prepared on the basis of continuation of the current Award. (Source:&#13;

FY2015/16                  Others: This sector includes development projects envisaged by various Federal&#13;
development budget         Divisions (see Figure 34) and has been allocated PKR 47.7 billion for the on-going&#13;
also focused on some       fiscal year. Most notably, Planning and Development Division has been allocated&#13;
special areas and          PKR 14 billion, compared to only PKR 6.2 billion spent by the division in&#13;
sectors, and started       FY2014/15. This allocation includes a block allocation of PKR 9.7 billion for un-&#13;
some new initiatives.      funded or underfunded important projects. This scheme appeared in FY2014/15&#13;
                           and amounted to PKR 27 billion. The considerable reduction in allocation of almost&#13;
                           PKR 17 billion in just one year indicates that most of the priority spending is being&#13;
                           financed from the regular PSDP, thereby leading to improved transparency with&#13;
                           respect to block allocations. Finance Division has been allocated PKR 9 billion,&#13;
                           mostly for provincial projects, including PKR 2 billion for Gwadar Development&#13;
                           Authority and PKR 1 billion for development of Ziarat Town. Moreover, allocation&#13;
                           for Interior Division almost doubled to PKR 8.3 billion, the apparent reason being&#13;
                           security related augmented spending. Similarly, Defense Division is set to receive&#13;
                           PKR 7.2 billion in this year.&#13;
                           Special Areas: For FY2015/16, PKR 43 billion has been allocated for development&#13;
                           projects in special areas â&#128;&#147; Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Gilgit Baltistan (GB),&#13;
                           Northern Areas and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) â&#128;&#147; that are&#13;
                           otherwise not included in the resource distribution framework of the federation.&#13;
                           Special Programmes: Two of these projects appeared in the Federal PSDP list last&#13;
                           year and are budgeted to continue this year. However, these largely encompass&#13;
                           block allocations on (i) MDGs &amp; community development (PKR 20 billion), and (ii)&#13;
                           federal development program/projects in provinces &amp; special areas (PKR 28.5&#13;
                           billion). In Pakistan, where federal financing of provincial projects has been an&#13;

&amp;#12;important instrument of fiscal equalization, yet given that the provincial PSDP itself&#13;
has been increased by an almost parallel 26 percent, the financing of provincial&#13;
programs from the federal budget needs to be limited. Spending on earthquake&#13;
reconstruction and rehabilitation83 is projected at PKR 7 billion.&#13;
New Programmes: This category â&#128;&#147; with 17 percent share â&#128;&#147; comes second after&#13;
infrastructure as the Federal government priority for 2015/16. Allocation for two&#13;
new programs that appeared in the revised estimates of last year, Special&#13;
Development Programme for Temporary Displaced Persons (TDPs) &amp; Security&#13;
Enhancements and Prime Ministerâ&#128;&#153;s Youth Programme, is budgeted to continue&#13;
and to increase. Former is allocated PKR 100 billion while latter is set to receive&#13;
PKR 20 billion for 2015/16.&#13;
Benazir Income Support Programme: BISP, as it is abbreviated, was launched in&#13;
July 2008 with an immediate objective of consumption smoothening and cushioning&#13;

and Fiscal Impact of      77 percent of the all the people affected by natural disasters were impacted by&#13;
Natural Disasters. In     flooding events. Eighty seven percent of the people affected by natural catastrophes&#13;
Pakistan,                 were resident in Punjab and Sindh. Since 1973 there have been 11 natural&#13;
approximately 3           catastrophe events that - were they to occur in the present day - could affect over&#13;
million people are        four million people in Pakistan. Pakistan is vulnerable to a number of adverse&#13;
affected by natural       natural events and has experienced a wide range of disasters over the past 40 years,&#13;
catastrophes each         including floods, earthquakes, droughts, cyclones and tsunamis. These hazards are&#13;

                          Pakistan increases, so does its economic exposure to natural disasters. A summary&#13;

There remains a lack      In general, the disaster risk management system defined in the NDM Act of 2010&#13;
of standardization in     and national disaster response plans are not followed in full at the provincial level.&#13;
procedures related to     Across the provinces approaches vary, in the case of Punjab disasters are typically&#13;
disaster risk             managed following instructions given in war books such as the financial war book;&#13;

The post-disaster               At the provincial level, although the financial responsibilities of governments are&#13;
financial                       not defined, generally they can be broadly categorized as Emergency Relief,&#13;
responsibilities of             Recovery and Reconstruction and Livelihoods Assistance to Affected Populations.&#13;
provincial                      In addition to these expenditures, other relief mechanisms may be provided. In&#13;
governments are not             Punjab, for instance, short term waivers on taxes on water and land are common&#13;
well defined.                   following a disaster. In certain cases waiver of interest on agriculture loans are&#13;
                                allowed as well as a delay in the repayment of these loans.&#13;
                                Since 2005, estimates of the total costs through the three post-disaster phases have&#13;
                                exceeded US$5 billion on two occasions. Total estimates for post-disaster costs for&#13;
                                the 2005 earthquake and the 2010 floods were approximately $US5.2 billion and&#13;
                                US$8.7 billion respectively. Estimates made during the respective preliminary&#13;
                                damage and needs assessments for four selected events since 2005 are shown in the&#13;
                                following Figure.&#13;
&#13;
Donor assistance can            For example, following the 2005 earthquake approximately US$520 million (62%)&#13;
represent a                     of a total estimated expenditure of US$845 million for relief and recovery came&#13;
significant, although           from international donors. For the 2007 Cyclone Yemyin, international donor&#13;
uncertain, part of              assistance accounted for approximately 59% of total relief and recovery spending&#13;
financing natural               (US$21 million of a total of US$36.2 million). In 2010 and 2011, following the&#13;
disasters, indeed               devastating flood events, donors contributed 81% (US$1.37 billion) and 65%&#13;
since 2005 donor                (US$157 million) of the relief and recovery spending. This information is&#13;
assistance has                  summarized in Figure 36. However, it should be noted in the Figure 35 above&#13;
accounted for                   that the total costs of the events summarized are between 4 and 7 times greater than&#13;
between                         the expenditures contributed to recovery and reconstruction. Thus, while donor&#13;
approximately 60%               financing plays an important role in financing recovery and reconstruction, it&#13;
and 80% of total                accounts for only 5%-16% percent of the financing needs.&#13;

The annual expected      A recurrence of the 2005 earthquake would cause a present day economic loss of&#13;
earthquake loss to       approximately US$ 2.8 billion which is almost double as compared to the losses&#13;
residential              caused to the housing sector by the 2005 earthquake. The contingent liability of the&#13;
properties/housing       government due to natural disasters can create significant fiscal risk. However the&#13;
sector alone is          GoPâ&#128;&#153;s contingent liability is not clearly defined in law and makes a fiscal risk&#13;
approximately US$ 1      assessment difficult to perform. Beyond its explicit contingent liability and&#13;
billion and that once    associated spending needs (such as the reconstruction of public assets and&#13;
every 100 years these    infrastructure), the government may have a moral and social responsibility (implicit&#13;
losses are expected      contingent liability) to assist the population in the aftermath of an extreme disaster&#13;
to exceed US$18.7        event. For example, the government provides not only emergency assistance (e.g.&#13;
billion.                 food, shelters and medical supplies) but it can also finance recovery and&#13;
                         reconstruction activities such as assistance for the rebuilding of low-income&#13;
                         housing. Contingent liabilities arising through the establishment of disaster-linked&#13;

Way forward.             A comprehensive national disaster risk financing strategy should be designed to&#13;
                         improve the capacity of the GoP to access immediate financial resources in the&#13;
                         event of a national disaster and to ensure that required funds are efficiently&#13;
                         delivered to beneficiaries, while maintaining the fiscal balance. The strategy should&#13;
                         follow the operational framework of: (i) assess risk; (ii) arrange financial solutions;&#13;
                         and (ii) deliver funds to beneficiaries.&#13;

                         Access to Financial Services Contributes to Economic Empowerment, which&#13;
                                                is a Key Challenge for Pakistan&#13;
Access to financial      Evidence suggests that financial inclusion is positively related to income levels as&#13;
services contributes     well as a more equitable income distribution. Theoretical and empirical economic&#13;
to economic              research over the years has shown that financial inclusion as measured through&#13;
empowerment,             access to and usage of financial sector products is positively correlated with growth&#13;
which is a key           and employment generation. At the macro level, greater inclusion causally impacts&#13;
challenge for            economic growth through lower transaction costs, enhanced deposits base, and&#13;
Pakistan.                efficient distribution of risk across the financial sector. At the micro level, financial&#13;
                         inclusion fosters development through enhanced access to credit, increased&#13;
                         household consumption, and consumption smoothing through savings.&#13;
&#13;
Pakistan has been a      There have been a large number of significant milestones which include: the&#13;
pioneer in               creation of a regulatory framework for MFBs (2001); the expansion and&#13;
championing              modernization of the online credit information bureau (e-CIB, 2005); the adoption&#13;
reforms aimed at         of Branchless Banking Regulations (2008, amended in 2011); the adoption of a&#13;
providing an             tiered approach to know-your-customer (KYC) requirements; the establishment of a&#13;
enabling                 specialized microfinance credit information bureau (m-CIB, 2009-2012); and the&#13;
environment for          launch of a nationwide Financial Literacy Program (2012). As a result, the enabling&#13;
financial inclusion      environment for microfinance is ranked among the worldâ&#128;&#153;s best, according to the&#13;
for over a decade.       Economistâ&#128;&#153;s Global Microscope 2014.&#13;
&#13;
Despite these            Pakistan is home to 5.2% of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s unbanked population and only 13.0%&#13;
sustained efforts, the   Pakistani adults have an account with a formal financial institution, making the&#13;
level of financial       financial inclusion agenda important from a country as well as global context.85 The&#13;
inclusion remains        gender divide remains a key challenge to address, as women are largely financial&#13;
very low.                excluded. Only 4.8% women are included in the formal financial sector compared to&#13;
                         the South Asian average of 37.4%. Additionally, those who are included have a&#13;
                         narrow range of credit and savings products to choose from, while not having&#13;
                         access to other specialized financial services such as insurance, pensions, and&#13;
                         agriculture and MSME finance.&#13;
&#13;
Around 50 countries      This is evidence of the global recognition of the importance of financial inclusion to&#13;
worldwide have set       income distribution and growth. Given that about 25 countries account for over&#13;
national targets for     73% of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s financially excluded population, there has been a global call for&#13;
financial                action for Universal Financial Access by 2020, through ambitious country-led&#13;
access/inclusion.        reforms which enable transformative and technology-led business models that&#13;
                         would lower costs, manage risks, and improve access to financial services for low-&#13;

infrastructure and        secured transactions framework and electronic collateral registry for moveable&#13;

commitments made         lay the foundations for implementing this vision. The key enablers cut across all&#13;
by the G-20 nations      priority sectors, and are; (1) public and private sector commitment to the NFIS and&#13;
and Alliance for         coordination; (2) enabling legal and regulatory environment; (3) adequate supervisory&#13;
Financial Inclusion      and judicial capacity; and (4) financial, payments and information and&#13;
(AFI), the State Bank    communications technology (ICT) infrastructure. The key enablers will support&#13;

collaboration with       ecosystem of financial services that will have the quality and features required by the&#13;
the World Bank,          Pakistani population and enterprises. These drivers are: (i) promoting Digital&#13;

Financial Inclusion      expanding and diversifying access points; (iii) improving capacity of financial service&#13;

                                              Coordinated Support is Necessary&#13;
The commitment to        The National Financial Inclusion Strategy has been developed at a particularly&#13;
achieving results is     opportune moment for Pakistan as technological innovation now allows financial&#13;
collectively shared by   institutions to capture economies of scale, while expansion of branchless banking&#13;

sector stakeholders,     environment to deliver significant impacts towards financial inclusion.&#13;

The NFIS has put         Policymakers, regulators and other financial sector stakeholders are already using the&#13;
forth a vision, a        NFIS framework to guide the financial inclusion reform agenda. The Finance&#13;

                                Legislative improvements are underway, such as passing of the Credit Bureaus Act&#13;
                                and approval of the secured transactions bill for onward submission to the&#13;
                                Parliament â&#128;&#147; both activities were supported by the NFIS86. Such policy reforms are&#13;
                                complemented by regulatory reforms such as the introduction of a new account&#13;
                                category called "Asaan Account" in June 2015 with simplified account opening&#13;
                                requirements/procedures for low-income low-risk customers. The NFIS has also&#13;
                                allowed for a more focused sub-sectoral planning process, such as with the launch&#13;
                                of the Microfinance Growth Strategy which highlights a critical funding and human&#13;
                                resource gap within the microfinance sector. Similarly, the World Bank will be&#13;
                                providing support to develop Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s national payments system strategy, which&#13;
                                would cover a comprehensive framework to guide the development of the national&#13;
                                payments system.&#13;

            Pakistan development update
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Pakistan’s economy posted GDP growth of
            4.2 percent in FY2014/15 compared to 4.0 percent in the
            previous year, but below the 5.1 percent targeted growth
            envisaged for FY2014-15 in the annual plan. On the demand
            side, investment and government consumption posted strong
            growth. Private consumption was supported by record high
            remittances in the order of US$18.7 billion in FY2014/15.
            The share of investment in GDP remains relatively small, at
            15.1 percent of GDP, about half of the South Asian average
            at 30 percent. More worryingly, private investment as a
            share of GDP has been declining and stood at 9.7 percent of
            GDP in FY2014/15. This low investment has implications for
            Pakistan’s long term growth potential that has been on a
            clear declining long run trend as discussed in special
            section three in this issue.  Exports declined in FY2014/15
            and this decline was broad based, a result of both low
            international prices of some of Pakistan’s export products
            as well as weak external demand. Textiles, which account for
            about half of all exports, posted a significant decline.
            Imports also declined, mainly due to lower international oil
            and commodity prices, although to a lesser extent than
            exports. Non-oil imports increased significantly, in
            particular metals, food, machinery and wood and paper
            products. Fiscal consolidation will require strong tax
            revenue efforts by the government as well as gradual
            phasing-out of energy-related subsidies and of reduced
            support to loss-making SOEs. Efforts to tighten fiscal
            policy will also need closer coordination with the
            provinces, and ensuring that progress in the country’s
            decentralization effort better aligns the province’s
            responsibilities with the increased resource envelop that
            resulted from the 7th NFC award. Efforts to prevent major
            shocks to the government’s fiscal stance should also include
            reducing the fiscal risks of the frequent natural disasters
            affecting Pakistan, an issue discussed in detail in special
            section five. On the external side, it will be important to
            increase efforts to attract more FDI from the current low
            levels, by improving the overall business climate and
            address regulatory weaknesses at the sectoral level that may
            be affecting the country’s ability to attract investment.
            Continued implementation of the government’s reform agenda
            to address structural bottlenecks, in particular in the
            energy sector, will also be crucial to be able to attract
            more investment.
