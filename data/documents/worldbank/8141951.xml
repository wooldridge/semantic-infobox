                                              ExecutiveSummary&#13;
&#13;
T      he Cambodia Rural Water Supply Coverage Analysis Project was implemented at the request of&#13;
       the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD).&#13;
       The reason for the formulation of the project was the release of two national data sets, showing&#13;
a marked discrepancy in rural water supply (RWS) coverage rates between them. Specifically, the&#13;
Cambodia Inter-censal Population Survey (CIPS) showed that 39.6% of the rural population has&#13;
access to safe water, while the Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey (CSES) showed that fully 60.1% of&#13;
the rural population has access to safe water; a difference of more than 20 percentage points.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The National CMDG targets "access to a safe water source" aim for 50% rural and 80% urban&#13;
coverage by 2015 (targets 7.10 and 7.11). Measuring progress towards those targets depends on&#13;
the definitions of "access" and "safe". While a definition is in use internationally (based on having&#13;
access to an "improved water supply" which provides at least 20 liters of water per person per day,&#13;
and is not further than 1000 meters away) no formal definition exists in Cambodia. Projects have&#13;
tended to use their own definitions of access, and different national surveys use different definitions&#13;
of which water supply technologies are considered "safe".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The main national surveys considered in this report (the Census, the Cambodia Inter-Census Population&#13;
Survey and Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey) all consider the following water sources to be safe:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Piped water&#13;
       Tube well&#13;
       Protected dug well&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Surface water (pond, river or stream) is considered unsafe by all surveys. Beyond that, interpretations differ.&#13;
The Census and CIPS consider bought water safe, but rainwater unsafe. The CSES sees bought water&#13;
as unsafe, but rainwater as safe. Looking at the approach followed by the national surveys, the following&#13;
issues become obvious:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   1.  There is no clear definition of "access to a safe (or improved) water source";&#13;
   2.  The terminology in use in the CMDG targets and the surveys implies a level of assessment accuracy&#13;
       that does not exist. It is not known whether water sources are "safe" or "unsafe"                because the&#13;
       water is not tested. It would be more accurate to speak of "improved source" vs. "unimproved source";&#13;
   3.  Related to the lack of definitions, there is no agreement on how to classify bought water and rain water;&#13;
   4.  Although survey data are reported as "access to safe water", what is actually measured is "use of an&#13;
       improved source". This leads to under reporting in the case where improved sources exist, but are not&#13;
       used, for example because of taste problems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                iii&#13;
                                                                                                                &#13;
                                                                                              Executive Summary&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Examining the differences in coverage figures between CIPS and CSES in more detail reveals the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       The fact that CSES and CIPS both classify rainwater and bought water differently introduces a difference&#13;
       between them of more than 7 percentage points.&#13;
       Almost all the remaining difference is caused by the fact that both surveys appear to have different&#13;
       definitions of what is a "protected dug well". The absolute difference between surveys in the dug&#13;
       well category (protected and unprotected) is only slightly more than one point. But disaggregating&#13;
       the numbers into protected dug wells and unprotected dug wells shows a difference of more than&#13;
       15 points between the "protected dug well" categories.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Neither CIPS nor CSES use a formal definition of what is considered a "protected dug well" although by&#13;
the numbers it is clear that whatever approach the CIPS uses, its definition is stricter, since the reported&#13;
numbers are much lower (CIPS reports 2.7% rural use of protected dug wells, while CSES reports&#13;
18.1%). Neither survey considers the full range of protective measures used internationally to lower the risk of&#13;
contamination, i.e.:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       A headwall around the well with a properly fitting cover&#13;
       A concrete drainage platform around the well, with drainage channel&#13;
       A hand pump or bucket with windlass&#13;
       A fence around the well&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Coverage trends were analyzed by taking data from the four CSES surveys conducted between 1996&#13;
and 2004, and separately considering the 1998 Census and the 2004 CIPS data. The 2000 Demographic&#13;
and Health Survey data were also considered, although no trend analysis could be performed, since data&#13;
from only one DHS are available. The analysis shows the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       The third CSES survey (from 1999) shows a dramatic rise in protected dug well coverage when compared&#13;
       with earlier surveys. No other survey shows a similar increase, and it appears possible that&#13;
       the definition of "protected dug well" used in the SES changed in 1999.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       The overall contribution of ground water (dug wells and tubewells) to the total has remained&#13;
       fairly constant since 1998, at around 60%. However, within the category we see the use of dug&#13;
       wells declined by about 10 points, while the use of tubewells increased by the same amount.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Other sources (including rainwater) fluctuate around 30%. Rainwater by itself shows a sudden&#13;
       peak in 2003-2004, growing to 13% from 1% or less three years earlier. A possible explanation for&#13;
       this growth is the fact that part of the latest SES was carried out during the wet season&#13;
       (when rainwater use is higher).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Data from 1997 seems anomalous in that piped water accounts for more than 13%, but for much&#13;
       less in the years before or after that peak, averaging some 2.9% over the period 1998-2004.&#13;
       The peak in piped water use also explains the "dip" seen in dug wells and other sources;&#13;
       the total has to add up to 100% after all, so growth in one category must be matched&#13;
       by a decrease in one or more others.&#13;
&#13;

        Executive summary&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         The major trend feature is that the SES data continually indicate higher coverage figures, and&#13;
         show a faster growth than CIPS. An approximate 10 percentage point difference between surveys in&#13;
         1996 had grown to a greater than 20 percentage point difference by 2004. The DHS figure of&#13;
         2000 falls very close to the Census-CIPS trend line compared to the trend line for the SES. The DHS&#13;
         data coinciding with the CIPS trend line indicates that the definitions used by it more closely&#13;
         resemble the definitions used by CIPS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A breakdown of available data by province unsurprisingly shows rural water supply access in the more&#13;
urbanized areas (e.g. Phnom Penh, Preay Veng, Pursat, Svay Reing) to be much above the national average,&#13;
while access in the more remote provinces (e.g. Mondul Kiri, Rattanak Kiri, Stueng Traeng) is much lower than&#13;
the national average.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Addressing the issues raised in this report will take a concerted effort by sector agencies, government&#13;
institutions and development partners. Some of the issues raised and recommendations given can be&#13;
dealt with fairly efficiently. Others will need further debate before a consensus can be reached. Not all of&#13;
the questions raised have a clear answer, but involve a judgement based on an understanding of the local&#13;
situation. These are important issues the water sector is faced with and everyone involved must work&#13;
together to come to a consensus for them to be resolved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  SummaryofRecommendations&#13;
&#13;
Please note that the recommendations are numbered according to the chapter in which they appear.&#13;
&#13;
   Recommendation 1.1&#13;
   Government and sector agencies should formulate an official definition of access to rural water supply&#13;
   services. This definition should encompass the classification of improved and unimproved sources,&#13;
   as well as considerations of water quantity and source accessibility. It is recommended that the definition&#13;
   take into account (but does not necessarily copy) existing internationally accepted definitions.&#13;
&#13;
   Recommendation 1.2&#13;
   The use of the terms "safe water source" and "unsafe water source" in official targets and definitions&#13;
   should be abandoned in favor of "improved source" and "unimproved source".&#13;
&#13;
   Recommendation 1.3&#13;
   The classification of "bought" water as safe in the census and CIPS should be urgently reconsidered.&#13;
   Considering bought water as "unimproved" more accurately reflects the reality in Cambodia -- where&#13;
   bought water mostly refers to untreated surface water--and at the same time mirrors international practice.&#13;
&#13;
   Recommendation 1.4&#13;
   The classification of "rainwater" in the same category as surface water in the CSES should be urgently&#13;
   reconsidered. International and national data provide ample justification for classification of rainwater as&#13;
   an improved source.&#13;
&#13;
   Recommendation 1.5&#13;
   Independent of the classification of rainwater as an improved or unimproved source, Census and&#13;
   CIPS surveys should list rainwater in a category by itself, distinct from surface water sources. This will allow&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                  v&#13;
                                                                                                Executive summary&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 a more meaningful breakdown of water use, and make for better comparability with data collected through&#13;
 the Socio-Economic Surveys.&#13;
&#13;
 Recommendation 1.6&#13;
 The agreed upon definitions and specifications for access to an improved water supply should be&#13;
 disseminated widely throughout the sector through the organisation of workshops as well as the release of&#13;
 written materials in English and Khmer. Particular care needs to be taken that the following institutions&#13;
 are fully briefed (not an exhaustive list):&#13;

&#13;
 Recommendation 2.1&#13;
 The Ministry of Rural development, together with sector agencies should draw up a clear definition&#13;
 of what constitutes a "protected" dug well, considering issues such as lining, headwall, covers, water&#13;
 withdrawal etc. following internationally accepted guidelines. The classification of protected dug wells as&#13;
 an improved or unimproved water source should be considered separately, in line with recommendation 1.1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Recommendation 2.2&#13;
 The National Institute of Statistics should be requested to officially adopt the definition and specifications&#13;
 for "access to an improved water source" for use in future surveys once these have been&#13;
 agreed upon by the relevant sector agencies (see also recommendation 1.1).&#13;
&#13;
 Recommendation 2.3&#13;
 Training materials based on the agreed definitions and specifications need to be developed, and NIS staff need&#13;
 to be trained in properly classifying "improved" vs. "unimproved" water sources according to those definitions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Recommendation 3.1&#13;
 Future national surveys should stratify Rural and Urban data according to the latest Rural/Urban&#13;
 classification published by the Ministry of Planning. The use of this classification should be stated explicitly&#13;
 in the survey report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Recommendation 3.2&#13;
 Responsible sector agencies, in cooperation with the National Institute of Statistics, should recommend which&#13;
 regularly implemented national survey will serve as the primary source for reporting water supply coverage&#13;
 figures, and will be used for tracking progress towards indicators 7.10 and 7.11 of the CMDGs.&#13;
&#13;
 Recommendation 3.3&#13;
 Responsible sector agencies should agree on which existing survey data will be used for reporting&#13;
 current water supply coverage in the interim period before the release of the next national survey&#13;
 (see also recommendation 3.2). Part of this agreement should be a consensus of which water supply&#13;
 sources in that survey will be considered as "improved" and "unimproved".&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 1.1. TheProject&#13;
T      he Cambodia Rural Water Supply Coverage Analysis Project was implemented at the requestof&#13;
       the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and the Ministry of Rural Development&#13;
       (MRD). It was carried out in the period of September through December 2005. The reason for the&#13;
formulation of the project was the release of two national data sets, showing a marked discrepancy&#13;
in rural water supply (RWS) coverage rates between them. Specifically, the Cambodia Inter-censal&#13;
Population Survey (CIPS) showed that 39.6% of the rural population has access to safe water,&#13;
while the Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey (CSES) showed that fully 60.1% of the rural population&#13;
has access to safe water; a difference of more than 20 percentage points.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
These access rates as reported by official national surveys are used to monitor changes in the water&#13;
supply situation over time. Changes are taken to indicate the degree of success in increasing the share&#13;
of the population with access to safe water. The large difference between the official figures causes&#13;
an equally large degree of uncertainty about the actual rural water supply situation in Cambodia, and for&#13;
this reason it was felt useful to investigate the causes of the discrepancy and to make recommendations&#13;
for improvement. This project was a collaborative effort between the staff of WSP and the staff of the&#13;
Department of Rural Health Care within the Ministry of Rural Development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The main objectives of the project were twofold: first to document any major gaps, inconsistencies or other&#13;
quality issues in the official RWS coverage figures obtained from the Ministry of Planning for&#13;
the period of 1996 - 2005. Second, to report coverage trends at the provincial and national levels&#13;
based on official data and research using Socio-Economic Survey data. Finally, the project allowed the&#13;
summary and presentation of a large amount of water supply data in one location, this report.&#13;
&#13;
 1.2. CambodiaDrinkingWaterAccessTargets&#13;
&#13;
In 2000, all 189 member states of the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Millennium Development&#13;
Goals (MDGs). These provided a set of measurable and time- bound goals and targets for combating&#13;
poverty, hunger, environmental degradation, illiteracy, etc. One target is to halve, by 2015, the proportion of&#13;
people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation (goal 7, target 10).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The MDG targets were "localized" in Cambodia, and are known as the Cambodian Millennium&#13;
Development Goals (CMDGs). The CMDGs dealing with water supply say that by 2015 50%of the rural&#13;
population and 80% of the urban population will have access to a safewater source. The Royal&#13;
Government of Cambodia (RGC) is committed to the MDG process,and intends to measure national&#13;
development performance with respect to the CMDGs. CMDG 7 contains a number of indicators regarding&#13;
water supply and sanitation as seen in Table 1.1.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Measuring progress towards these targets hinges on the definitions of "access" and "safe". Unfortunately,&#13;
there is no further explanation of these terms in either the CMDG documents or Cambodia's National&#13;
Policy on Water Supply and Sanitation. The following section will explore some international definitions,&#13;
as well as some approaches adopted in Cambodia.&#13;
&#13;
  1.3. DefiningAccesstoImprovedWaterSupplies&#13;
&#13;
The range of options available for improving access to water (and sanitation) is wide, especially in&#13;
low-income settings where large proportions of the population have access to only the most basic facilities&#13;
(Hutton and Haller, 2004). For developing countries, options that are low cost, are feasible and do not require&#13;
heavy maintenance are generally favored. Internationally, the Global Water Supply Assessment 2000 report&#13;
established definitions that have become generally accepted for the purposes of monitoring coverage. Table 1.2&#13;
categorizes which type of services are considered "improved" and which are considered to be "unimproved".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Improved water supply technologies                      Unimproved water supply technologies&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
    Public standpipe                                              Unprotected spring&#13;
&#13;
    Borehole                                                      Vendor-provided water&#13;
&#13;
    Protected dug well                                            Bottled water (quantity)&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Table 1.2: Improved vs. unimproved water supply technologies&#13;
Source: http://www.wssinfo.org/en/122_definitions.html&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Note that services can be defined as "unimproved" not only if they are unsafe, but also if obtaining a sufficient&#13;
quantity of water would be unnecessarily costly, such as bottled water or water provided by tanker truck.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Basic, low technology improvements to water services generally involve better access and protected water&#13;
sources (standpipes, borehole, protected dug well or spring, or collected rain water). Improvement&#13;
does not necessarily mean that the water is safe, but it is more accessible, and some measures are taken to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    &#13;
              INTRODUCTION&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
protect the source from contamination. In the global definition used for monitoring water supply coverage,&#13;
it is assumed that an improved source would provide at least 20 liters of water per capita per day (lcd)&#13;
at a distance no further than 1,000 meters. Household connections are considered a high technology&#13;
improvement providing water that is safe for drinking.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition, household level water treatment and storage (sometimes referred to as "Point of Use"&#13;
treatment or POU) such as water filters or the use of chlorine can make water safer. Please note that POU&#13;
treatment is not included in the table of technologies, even though its use is becoming widespread in certain&#13;
 countries, including Cambodia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
While the definitions listed in table 1.2 are used globally, they have not been officially adopted in Cambodia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Box1:Safewatervs.improvedsupplies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      The definitions used internationally for monitoring water supply coverage use the descriptions&#13;
      "improved supply" and "unimproved supply". It is recognized that an improved supply does&#13;
      not necessarily provide safe water (except treated, piped supplies). The condition of the technology is&#13;
      critical to the quality of the water, and improved technologies can still be contaminated due to the way&#13;
      they are used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Water quality and the quantity used are difficult to measure, so type of technology and distance&#13;
      to the source are used as proxy indicators. The assumption is that the chances of obtaining safe water from an&#13;
      improved supply are higher than from an unimproved supply, and that a source that is close enough&#13;
      will lead to increased quantities of water being used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      By specifying "access to a safe water source" in its indicators, Cambodia raises the bar. Access to a safe&#13;
      source has a stricter meaning than access to an improved supply. In practice however, national surveys&#13;
      in Cambodia do not identify "safe" sources; they distinguish between improved and unimproved supplies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The following criteria are important in coming to a definition:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Quantity of water;&#13;
       Quality of water; and&#13;
       Distance to the source.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Policy Framework prepared by MRD in 2001 proposes 20 liters&#13;
per person per day as minimum quantity of water that has to be provided by an improved source. Although&#13;
this figure was not made official, it is generally accepted (Ockelford, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Distance to the source has never been identified as part of the "access" definition, and projects have&#13;
tended to make their own decisions about what is acceptable. For example, the EU PRASAC project set&#13;
the maximum walking distance to a water point at 150 meters, based on the observation that people continue&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                     &#13;
                                                                                                        INTRODUCTION&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
to use their traditional unimproved sources if distances to improved sources are too far (ibid). It is&#13;
clear that the global definition of less than 1 km. used for MDG monitoring is not appropriate for Cambodia;&#13;
people will not walk that far to fetch safe water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Quality of water can be taken to mean "meeting the national water quality standards". However, water&#13;
 meeting the quality standards may not be acceptable to users because of taste problems (in many cases caused&#13;
by iron or manganese in the water). This means that a family or community may have access to what is&#13;
considered a safe source, but may not use it. This may cause issues with the national surveys, since&#13;
they provide data on water sources used as reported by households, they don't describe access.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Box2:Accessvs.Use&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Many villages in Cambodia have one or more handpumps installed on a tubewell. They have access&#13;
     to an improved source. However, because there are often taste issues with ground water from&#13;
      the wells, many people continue to use surface water or rain water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     A survey that asks households what water they use, and then reports the figures as water supply&#13;
     access may come to the wrong conclusion. Actual access to improved sources may be much larger than&#13;
     that reported by such a survey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     There are indications that such differences occur in all national surveys in Cambodia. However, since&#13;
     all surveys report use (not access) this would not explain the differences between the surveys.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  1.4. MeasuringAccesstoDrinkingWaterinCambodia&#13;
&#13;
Rural Water Supply coverage in Cambodia is measured in the Census and the Cambodia Inter-censal&#13;
Population Survey (each carried out at 10 year intervals), the Socio-Economic Survey (SES, carried out&#13;
regularly), and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS, carried out periodically). All national surveys&#13;
are carried out and their results are officially reported by the National Institute of Statistics (NIS)&#13;
of the Ministry of Planning (MOP).&#13;
&#13;
None of these surveys have been declared the "primary source" for water supply and sanitation data,&#13;
but the Socio-Economic Survey data have been used as the de facto standard because it is the most&#13;
regularly updated data set available. None of these surveys use the definition for "access to an&#13;
improved water source" given above. Technically speaking, the surveys identify "improved" vs.&#13;
"unimproved" supplies; they do not identify sources that can be considered "safe" because they meet the&#13;
national drinking water quality standards. The lack of definitions makes it difficult to say who has a safe or an&#13;
unsafe supply and is the primary contributor to discrepancies between the surveys.&#13;
&#13;
In order for the RGC (or sector agencies) to measure their progress towards the CMDGs they rely on these&#13;
national surveys. The accuracy of the national surveys will thus influence the confidence with which&#13;
CMDG updates and projections can be approached.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    &#13;
         INTRODUCTION&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The data used in the project were those of two national level surveys conducted by the NIS. The Cambodia&#13;
Socio-Economic Survey (CSES) was conducted in 1996, 1997, 1999, and over 2003 ­ 2004 collecting&#13;
data in both the wet season and the dry season. The second set of data is the Cambodia Inter-censal&#13;
Population Survey (CIPS) carried out in 2004 in order to update the national Census of 1998. In most of the&#13;
analysis, the CSES data of 2003-2004 are presented side-by-side with the CIPS data of 2004. Other data&#13;
are summarized in the appendices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The CIPS and CSES surveys of 2004 were of similar size and scope; CIPS surveyed around 21,000&#13;
households in 700 villages around Cambodia. The CSES surveyed approximately 15,000 households.&#13;
The surveys were conducted using a standard questionnaire in which there is a question for each&#13;
household surveyed regarding their source of drinking water. The household then selects from nine&#13;
available categories what source of water they use. The information is self-reported; there is no observation&#13;
or independent verification by the interviewer. Also, as noted earlier, respondents report water sources used.&#13;
This means that strictly speaking the surveys do not measure access (for example, a respondent may have&#13;
access to a dug well close by, but she may prefer using river water because she does not like the taste&#13;
of the well water. In this case, access to the well will not be reported).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Which water sources are considered to be safe and which are unsafe differs for each survey. Tables 1.3 and&#13;
1.4 show the water source categories distinguished by the CIPS and the CSES surveys, as well as their&#13;
classification as safe or unsafe.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
 1.5.SomeInitialObservationsandRecommendations&#13;
&#13;
There are a number of important differences between "safe water" definitions used by the CIPS and CSES&#13;
surveys. In the first place, the CIPS has a total of seven categories, four of which are considered safe, and three&#13;
of which are considered unsafe. The CSES recognizes nine types of water supply, of which five are safe, and the&#13;
remaining four are considered unsafe.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bought water, as well as rain water are in different categories in both surveys. The census and&#13;
CIPS consider bought water safe, and classify rainwater as unsafe in the same category as surface water.&#13;
The CSES reverses this; it recognizes rainwater as a separate category, considered safe, while bought water&#13;
is considered unsafe. These disparities alone would lead us to expect differences between the findings of&#13;
both surveys, even before we saw the actual figures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The classification of bought water and rainwater is important. Bought water in the rural Cambodian&#13;
context mostly refers to private vendors, selling water obtained from a river or pond, and sold&#13;
without treatment. It is clearly microbially unsafe, and should never be considered a "safe" or "improved"&#13;
source. It should not be confused with "bottled" water. Rainwater is safe as it comes to us from the&#13;
sky. Whether it remains so largely depends on the conditions of catchment and storage. Is the roof&#13;
clean? Is there a first flush system? Is the tank closed, and is water withdrawn by tap or pump?&#13;
These are some of the questions that influence microbial quality of rain water. Classifying rainwater as an&#13;
"improved source" rather than trying to make the distinction "safe/unsafe" would resolve any uncertainty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Finally, the language used in the surveys ("safe source" vs. "improved source") raises the bar, and leads to&#13;
questions about some of the classifications (such as the example for rainwater given above). Practically&#13;
speaking, measuring whether water is "safe" (i.e. meets the standards) is impossible in national population&#13;
surveys, and should not even be attempted at such a scale. In reality, "improved" and "unimproved"&#13;
should be substituted for "safe" and "unsafe" respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Box3:Boughtwater&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Bought water can be further classified as either "bottled water" or bulk water delivered to the home by&#13;
     tanker truck, water cart etc. Bottled water would under most circumstances be considered safe to drink.&#13;
     The fact that it is not considered an "improved source" is because it would be prohibitively expensive&#13;
     to obtain enough bottled water even to satisfy drinking and cooking needs only.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Bulk water deliveries are less easily categorized. Water provided by tanker truck may be safe in some&#13;
     countries, and unsafe in others. The same goes for water carts. Water delivered straight from&#13;
     a surface water source, for example by a vendor with a "pump and a pipe" would always be unsafe.&#13;
     Bulk water is generally classified as "unimproved" because it is considered to be unnecessarily costly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The Cambodian national surveys do not make a distinction between bottled water and water delivered&#13;
     in bulk. Both CSES and CIPS list "bought" only. CIPS and census consider bought water to be safe,&#13;
     while CSES does not. Arguably, the CSES interpretation is the correct one; bought water should not be&#13;
     considered safe (or improved). This is because in Cambodia "bought" water mostly refers not to&#13;
     treated or bottled water, but to water supplied by vendors who pump directly from a river or pond.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

   &#13;
         INTRODUCTION&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  Recommendation 1.1&#13;
  Government and sector agencies should formulate an official definition of access to rural water supply&#13;
  services. This definition should encompass the classification of improved and unimproved sources,&#13;
  as well as considerations of water quantity and source accessibility. It is recommended that&#13;
  thedefinitiontakeintoaccount(butdoesnotnecessarilycopy)existinginternationallyaccepteddefinitions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Recommendation 1.2&#13;
  The use of the terms "safe water source" and "unsafe water source" in official targets and definitions&#13;
  should be abandoned in favor of "improved source " and "unimproved source".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Recommendation 1.3&#13;
  The classification of "bought" water as safe in the census and CIPS should be urgently&#13;
  reconsidered. Considering bought water as "unimproved" more accurately reflects the reality in&#13;
  Cambodia -- where bought water mostly refers to untreated surface water -- and at the same time&#13;
  mirrors international practice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Recommendation 1.4&#13;
  The classification of "rainwater" in the same category as surface water in the CSES should&#13;
  be urgently reconsidered. International and national data provide ample justification for&#13;
  classification of rainwater as an improved source.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Recommendation 1.5&#13;
  Independent of the classification of rainwater as an improved or unimproved source, Census and CIPS&#13;
  surveys should list rainwater in a category by itself, distinct from surface water sources. This will&#13;
  allow a more meaningful breakdown of water use, and make for better comparability with data&#13;
  collected through the Socio-Economic Surveys.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Recommendation 1.6&#13;
  The agreed upon definitions and specifications for access to an improved water supply should be&#13;
  disseminated widely throughout the sector through the organisation of workshops as well as&#13;
  the release of written materials in English and Khmer. Particular care needs to be taken that the&#13;
  following institutions are fully briefed (not an exhaustive list):&#13;

   2.1. DataGap&#13;
C            omparing Socio-Economic Survey and Cambodia Inter-censal Population Survey water supply data at&#13;
             national level reveals some interesting issues. The most obvious is the fact that the 2004 CIPS&#13;
             survey concludes that 44.2% of people in Cambodia have access to a safe water source, while the&#13;
2003/2004 CSES survey lists 63.5% access to safe water nationally.&#13;
&#13;
Since Cambodia's population is predominantly rural, it is no surprise that a similar difference is found between&#13;
the figures for access to safe water by the rural population (39.6% and 60.1% for CIPS and CSES1&#13;
respectively). Table 2.1 summarizes the findings of both surveys, at national level as well as for rural data&#13;
only. It is clear from the table that the CSES recognizes more water supply categories than the CIPS. Please&#13;
note that if we remove bought water from the "safe" category, national coverage according to the CIPS would&#13;
drop to 37.5%, while rural coverage would drop to 33.3%. The difference between the surveys would&#13;
increase to more than 26 percentage points.&#13;

Table 2.1 ­ Summary of findings of both surveys, highlighting the differences between them.&#13;
Note: In this table the figures used for the CSES are the average of the wet and dry season data. In 2003 and 2004 for the first time the CSES collected data in both the&#13;
wet and the dry season. The main difference between the seasons is an increase in rain water use in the wet season, and an increase in well water use in the dry season.&#13;
1If rural access to safe water were indeed 60.1%, this would mean that the CMDG target indicator (7.10) had been met and significantly exceeded...10 years ahead of&#13;
schedule. This is most unlikely.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     &#13;
              Comparative Analysis of CIPS and SES Data&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The differences are quite large, and are due to differences in specific categories. The highlighted entries&#13;
represent water sources considered "safe" in the respective survey (as decided by the NIS). The major&#13;
differences between the two surveys are found in the categories of protected and unprotected dug&#13;
wells. The total proportion of dug wells is very close in each survey, a difference of only 1.1&#13;
percentage points. However the difference between the protected dug well categories in each survey was&#13;
15.4 percentage points for the rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The second big difference occurs in the "Pond, river, stream and rainwater" category. The CIPS classified all&#13;
of these sources in one big group, and labeled it unsafe in its entirety. CSES took a different approach&#13;
and split this category into two pieces: pond, river and stream; and rainwater. The CSES then considered&#13;
this rainwater category as a safe source leading to a further 13.6 percentage points difference in safe water&#13;
access. In the CIPS, bought water is considered safe, while in the CSES it is considered unsafe. The&#13;
different classifications of rainwater and bought water introduces a difference between surveys of more&#13;
than seven points. The rest of the difference is explained by the different protected dug well counts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 2.2. Analysis&#13;
&#13;
The contradictory definitions of what is a protected dug well forms the central issue of the divergence in&#13;
reported coverage, accounting for more than half the difference. Compared to the CSES, the CIPS&#13;
survey has a stricter definition of what is considered a protected dug well, leading to much lower&#13;
numbers in protected dug wells, and a higher unprotected dug well count.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The National Institute of Statistics does not use a formal definition for what constitutes a "protected dug well".&#13;
The person in charge of training the people who will conduct a particular survey out in the field&#13;
sets the definition of what a protected dug well is. This definition is then used in all training&#13;
materials related to that survey. In practice, this has led to the use of the definitions as set out in table 2.2 below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        To be considered protected, a dug well must have:                                 CIPS                             CSES&#13;

Mr. Tith Vong, who did training for the CSES, the wells shown in figures 2.2 would be considered protected.&#13;
Mrs. Hang Lina, who conducted training for the CIPS Team, would classify them as unprotected due to&#13;
their lack of a cover. Figure 2.3 show wells that would be considered protected in both CIPS and CSES.&#13;

While the CIPS definition may be more conservative, leading to a lower number of protected dug wells,&#13;
it still is not a fully effective definition. Neither the SES northe CIPS definition includes all the elements&#13;
mentioned in Box 4.&#13;

        Recommendation 2.1&#13;
        The Ministry of Rural development, together with sector agencies should draw up a clear definition of&#13;
        what constitutes a "protected" dug well, considering issues such as lining, headwall, covers,&#13;
        water withdrawal etc. following internationally accepted guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The classification of protected dug wells as an improved or unimproved water source should be considered&#13;
separately, in line with recommendation 1.1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Box4:ProtectedWaterSources&#13;
&#13;
     When talking of a "protected" water source, what do we mean? Explaining that we mean protection&#13;
     from sanitary risk only brings us a little closer, because what is sanitary risk? "Sanitary risk"&#13;
     expresses the likelihood of the water in the source becoming contaminated. There are three factors that&#13;
     contribute to sanitary risk:&#13;
&#13;
     Hazard factors: these are factors from which contamination may come and are a measure of sources&#13;
     of faeces in the environment. Examples include pit latrines, solid waste dumps and animal husbandry.&#13;
&#13;
     Pathway factors: these are factors that allow microbiological contamination to enter the water supply,&#13;
     but do not provide the faecal matter directly. Pathways are often critical to whether contamination occurs,&#13;
     as the presence of a hazard may not result in contamination if no pathway exists for the&#13;
     contaminants to reach the water supply. Examples of pathway factors include cracked or missing well&#13;
     aprons, loose pump attachment and damaged protection works.&#13;
&#13;
     Indirect factors: these are hazards close to the source or factors that enhance the development of&#13;
     pathway factors. Indirect factors do not directly allow water into the source nor are they a source of faeces.&#13;
     Examples include lack of fencing or faulty surface water drainage.&#13;
&#13;
     Applying these concepts to the dug well technology, we could say that protection consists of having all of&#13;
     the following:&#13;
&#13;
        A headwall around the well with a properly fitting cover&#13;
        A concrete drainage platform around the well, with drainage channel&#13;
         A hand pump or bucket with windlass&#13;
         A fence around the well&#13;
&#13;
     Risk can be further reduced by proper siting, away from latrines or other sources of pollution. Assessing&#13;
     risk factors and facility status would normally be done in dedicated sanitary surveys performed&#13;
     by communities or external agencies. A survey like CSES or CIPS can only hope to note the major features&#13;
     of a well, such as drainage, headwall, cover, water withdrawal method and fencing.&#13;
&#13;
     We should note that a protected dug well can count as an improved water source, but it is not necessarily&#13;
     safe, as explained in chapter 1.&#13;

                                                                                                Comparative Analysis of CIPS and SES Data&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The remainder of the difference between CIPS and SES is accounted for by the different classifications of bought&#13;
water and rainwater. This difference occurs simply because CIPS counts bought water as safe, but does&#13;
not count rainwater as a safe source of drinking water. CIPS groups rainwater with pond, river, and stream water&#13;
and considers this category unsafe.                   SES considers bought water unsafe, together with pond, river and&#13;
stream water but then includes a separate category for rainwater, which is considered safe.&#13;
Following the same definitions in both surveys will eliminate this component of the difference. The&#13;
consideration whether to classify rainwater as an improved source or an unimproved source should be left to&#13;
the relevant sector agencies, although the authors are in favor of considering rainwater an improved&#13;
source, in line with international practice. As stated in chapter one, bought water should not be considered safe.&#13;
If rainwater were to be considered an improved source, the question would need to be answered whether there&#13;
should be a further distinction along the same lines as for dug wells: one category for "protected rain water&#13;
storage" (considered improved) and one for "unprotected rainwater storage" (considered unimproved).&#13;
Many different approaches to rainwater catchment and storage are practiced in Cambodia, arguably not all of&#13;
them "improved". Just as with dug wells, following this route would bring up the question of how to&#13;
classify safe storage versus unsafe storage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Recommendation 2.2&#13;
        The National Institute of Statistics should be requested to officially adopt the definition and&#13;
        specifications for "access to an improved water source" for use in future surveys once these have been&#13;
        agreed upon by the relevant sector agencies (see also recommendation 1.1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Recommendation 2.3&#13;
        Training materials based on the agreed definitions and specifications need to be developed, and NIS&#13;
        staff need to be trained in properly classifying "improved" vs. "unimproved" water sources according&#13;
        to those definitions.&#13;

  3.1. NationalData&#13;
T          he national data that have been compiled come from both the Socio Economic Survey and the&#13;
           Inter-censal Population Survey. The SES contains data from 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2003/&#13;
           2004. CIPS only has data from 2004, but we can compare these data to the data from the Census&#13;
of 1998. The CIPS and Census used the same data collection instruments and the same training, making the&#13;
data sets comparable. Table 3.1 shows all of the rural water supply data available from the different&#13;
surveys and different years. The highlighted boxes represent categories that are considered safe water&#13;
sources in that particular survey. The years 2001 and 2002 are shown to highlight that no surveys took place&#13;
in those years.&#13;

Figure 3.1: trends over time in rural water supply access&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Looking at both table 3.1 and figure 3.1 leads us to the following observations:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     According to the SES, protected dug wells show a large increase between 1997 and 1999 (from 4.7%&#13;
     to 22.1%). The latest available SES data show protected dug well coverage remaining high, but DHS&#13;
     and CIPS show much lower numbers. As a matter of fact, DHS 2000 and CIPS 2004 data show much&#13;
     more consistency with the early SES data than with the later SES data. It appears possible that the&#13;
     definition of "protected dug well" used in the SES changed in 1999.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The overall contribution of ground water (dug wells and tubewells) to the total has remained fairly&#13;
     constant since 1998, at around 60%. However, within the category we see the use of dug&#13;
     wells declined by about 10 points, while the use of tubewells increased by the same amount.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Other sources (including rainwater) fluctuate around 30%. Rainwater by itself shows a sudden peak&#13;
     in 2003-2004, growing to 13% from 1% or less three years earlier. A possible explanation for this&#13;
     growth is the fact that part of the latest SES was carried out during the wet season. Rural rainwater&#13;
     use in the wet season is almost 26% while in the dry season it is 1.4%. The high wet season number&#13;
     influences the average significantly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Data from 1997 seem anomalous in that piped water accounts for more than 13%, but for much less&#13;
     in the years before or after that peak, averaging some 2.9% over the period 1998-2004. The peak in&#13;
     piped water use also explains the "dip" seen in dug wells and other sources; the total has to add&#13;
     up to 100% after all, so growth in one category must be matched by a decrease in one or more others.&#13;

Figure 3.2: Trends in access to safe water supplies in rural areas according to different surveys&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The trends that we have are not all that dissimilar, showing a definite improvement in rural water supply&#13;
access over time.                                   Please note that the inclusion of "bought water" as safe in the Census and CIPS&#13;
inflates the coverage figures by about 6%. The absence of rainwater as a safe source on the other hand,&#13;
decreases coverage somewhat in the early years and a lot in 2004.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The major feature of this graph is that the SES data continually indicate higher coverage figures,&#13;
and show a faster growth than CIPS. Also note that an approximate 10 percentage point difference&#13;
between surveys in 1996 has grown to a greater than 20 percentage point difference by 2004.&#13;
The DHS figure of 2000 falls very close to the CIPS trend line as indicated by the triangle&#13;
in figure 3.2 compared to the trend line for the SES. The differences between the SES and CIPS trends can be&#13;
explained based on the different definitions used. The DHS data coinciding with the CIPS trend line indicates&#13;
that the definitions used by it more closely resemble the definitions used by CIPS although details on the&#13;
DHS were not available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In a report by the Ministry of Planning released in October of 2005, Achieving the Cambodia Millennium&#13;
Development Goals 2005 Update, an updated figure was released for the rural access to safe water.&#13;
While the update did not make clear what data sources were used to arrive at the estimate,&#13;
the figure closely resembles that of the CIPS data. The figure used by MOP is 41.6%, a small&#13;
increase from the CIPS 2004 figure of 39.6% including bought water as a safe source (If CIPS had not&#13;
counted "bought" water as safe ­which is arguably the correct interpretation- the updated CMDG target&#13;
would represent an increase of 8.3 percentage points over the 2004 CIPS data).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                       &#13;
                                                                                                                                       National Trends&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    Box5:Ruralvs.Urban&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In addition to the issue of needing to define "access to safe water" as mentioned before, stratifying data&#13;
     by "rural coverage" and "urban coverage" means that we need a clear definition of what is "urban"&#13;
     and what is "rural".&#13;
&#13;
     The Ministry of Planning carried out a reclassification of rural and urban areas in 2004. The Ministry of&#13;
     Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME) used this reclassification as the basis for assessing progress&#13;
     in expanding the water supply service coverage in urban areas in 2005.&#13;
&#13;
     While in the rural sector, the term "safe water" tends to be defined as having access to a particular type&#13;
     of source -rather than the quality of the water and the reliability of the supply- The MIME assessment&#13;
     defined safe water in the urban context as water meeting the National Drinking Water Quality Standards.&#13;
     Since no water quality data are available, MIME considered all water supplied through an operating water&#13;
     meter from a piped distribution system and a water treatment and disinfection facility to be safe water.&#13;
&#13;
     According to this definition of safe water for urban areas, in 2005, only about 37% of urban population&#13;
     had access to safe water. This result shows a large difference from the sector's key indicators for&#13;
     the CMDG, which determined that 68% of urban population should have access to safe water by 2005.&#13;
&#13;
     While the urban classification of "safe" water access has issues similar to that of the rural sector,&#13;
     the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy is making some clear choices in order to improve the data being&#13;
     used towards the CMDGs.&#13;

&#13;
 3.2. Implications&#13;
&#13;
Based on the analysis of all the data from the Socio-Economic Surveys, the 1998 Census, and the&#13;
Cambodia Inter-censal Population Survey we can make some decisions as to which data sets give&#13;
us a good picture of the water supply situation in Cambodia. Many ministries and sector agencies need&#13;
to be able to look at water supply data and make decisions regarding funding, priority areas or&#13;
project design and implementation. It is important to be clear on the data sources available, and their&#13;
reliability and limitations.The current situation is one of incomparable datasets, and a resulting&#13;
uncertainty over current status and progress.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As we compare the definitions used in each survey we observe the following:&#13;
&#13;
CIPS uses a stricter, and arguably more "correct" definition of protected dug wells. Even so, the definition&#13;
in use can probably be enhanced further. The better definition arguably provides a figure that is much&#13;
more representative of which dug wells should be considered improved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    &#13;
          National Trends&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
On the other hand, there are elements of the CIPS survey that make it less desirable to use than&#13;
the SES. The inclusion of bought water as safe, and the exclusion of rainwater as safe are two important&#13;
examples. Also, the CIPS survey breaks down water sources into fewer categories than the SES. The SES&#13;
is a more detailed survey, containing nine individual categories (as opposed to the seven in CIPS) but these&#13;
categories are not as strictly defined as those in CIPS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Socio-Economic Surveys provide a lot of historical data, but also show a number of unexplained&#13;
swings in certain categories, including piped supplies, protected dug wells and rainwater. Without strong&#13;
explanations for differences observed from year to year, it is difficult to weigh the reliability of the data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Unfortunately the Demographic and Health Survey does not have any historic data to compare to the 2000&#13;
survey. This will change in 2006, as the DHS 2005 is currently in the field collecting data. That data&#13;
should be processed and available by the end of 2006 according to the National Institute of Statistics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
When looking at the pros and cons of each data set it is apparent that each survey has its uses. The SES&#13;
provides a good deal of historic data and a detailed breakdown of water supplies. For their work&#13;
with the CMDGs the Ministry of Planning has used CIPS which seems to provide a more conservative&#13;
view of water supply coverage in Cambodia. The authors would support the use of CIPS data for&#13;
this purpose, while at the same time urging responsible ministries and sector agencies to implement the&#13;
recommendations laid out in this report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Recommendation 3.1&#13;
  Future national surveys should stratify Rural and Urban data according to the latest Rural/Urban&#13;
  classification published by the Ministry of Planning. The use of this classification should be stated&#13;
  explicitly in the survey report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Recommendation 3.2&#13;
  Responsible sector agencies, in cooperation with the National Institute of Statistics, should recommend&#13;
  which regularly implemented national survey will serve as the primary source for reporting water supply&#13;
  coverage figures, and will be used for tracking progress towards indicators 7.10 and 7.11 of the CMDGs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Recommendation 3.3&#13;
  Responsible sector agencies should agree on which existing survey data will be used for reporting&#13;
  current water supply coverage in the interim period before the release of the next national survey&#13;
  (see also recommendation 3.2). Part of this agreement should be a consensus of which water supply&#13;
  sources in that survey will be considered as "improved" and "unimproved".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  3.3. ProvincialBreakdown&#13;
&#13;
In order to use the data more effectively they have been broken down by province. Some provinces&#13;
show progress in the rural water supply sector well above that of the national average, while other provinces&#13;
lag behind the curve.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                             &#13;
                                                                                             National Trends&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Table 3.3 summarizes data by province from the four Socio-Economic Surveys carried out between 1996&#13;
and 2004. The categories that compose the "safe" supplies in this table are: protected dug well, piped in&#13;
dwelling, public tap, rainwater, and tube/piped well. By simply comparing the coverage percentage of each&#13;
province to the national average of 63.5% it is immediately clear which provinces are doing well and&#13;
which are not.&#13;

&#13;
As could be expected, typically more urbanized areas (like Phnom Penh) have higher rates of access.&#13;
Phnom Penh, Prey Veaeng, Pursat, Krong Preah Sihanouk, and Svay Rieng are the provinces that are 15&#13;
percentage points or more above the national average. Mondul Kiri, Rattanak Kiri, Stueng Traeng,&#13;
and Krong Kaeb are the provinces that are 15 percentage points or more below the national average.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
While there are some obvious issues with the different data sets from each province, in general the&#13;
provincial data can be an excellent guide to which provinces are doing well, and which provinces&#13;
still need a lot of work. Even if there are questions about the absolute accuracy of the different surveys,&#13;
the data from one survey can still be used to judge relative performance among provinces. This also&#13;
illustrates the importance of having accurate surveys. Basing surveys on nationally accepted, documented                       CharpterII&#13;
definitions leads to better data, which in turn allow better analysis of each province. Better analysis&#13;
can help government decide what sort of projects should be located in which provinces. The more&#13;
information gathered from each province the more useful these surveys will be and the better&#13;
the quality of services that can be delivered to those provinces that need it. More detailed information and&#13;
data for each province are located in Appendix B.&#13;

SomeFinal&#13;
Remarks&#13;
T       wo sets of national data, both supposed to be describing the proportion of access to safe rural water&#13;
        supplies, and two completely different numbers. In short, that describes the current situation in&#13;
        Cambodia's water supply sector. Before a survey goes into the field to collect data, officials of the&#13;
Ministry of Planning train the surveyors for that survey. Because there is no agreed upon national definition&#13;
for access to an improved water supply, training is done differently for each survey. To resolve the&#13;
discrepancies between data sets, the definitions used for all national surveys regarding water supply&#13;
(and sanitation) must be universal. Once a set of definitions is decided upon, these can be widely&#13;
disseminated and training can be standardized for every national survey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Making all of this happen will require a concerted effort by many organizations and institutions with an&#13;
interest in the sector. The Ministry of Rural Development is clearly the agency mandated to take the lead&#13;
in addressing the issues raised in this report, but strong cooperation from the National Institute of&#13;
Statistics, the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy, UNICEF, WHO and others will also be required.&#13;

Applying a national definition of "access to an improved water supply" to future surveys will very likely lead&#13;
to a correction of the water supply coverage figures quoted in the past. For example, it is likely that&#13;
the next Socio-Economic Survey will report national access to an improved water supply source lower than&#13;
the 63.5% reported by the last one. Such a correction would need to be explained in the survey report in&#13;
order to increase the chances of it being accepted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Some of the issues raised and recommendations given in this report can be dealt with fairly efficiently.&#13;
Others will need further debate before a consensus can be reached. Not all of the questions raised&#13;
have a clear answer, but involve a judgement based on an understanding of the local situation. Where does&#13;
rainwater belong? Does improper storage lead to it becoming an unsafe source? Is the term "safe" an&#13;
appropriate label for a water source? Should organizations that construct (or fund) water supplies be&#13;
required to meet the standards specified for "improved supplies"? These questions and others are important&#13;
issues the water sector is faced with and everyone involved, be it the ministries or sector agencies, must work&#13;
together to come to a consensus for them to be resolved.&#13;

            Measuring rural water supply access :
            findings from a comparative analysis of Cambodian national
            surveys - project report, June 2006
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report describes the two sets of
            national data, both supposed to be describing the proportion
            of access to safe rural water supplies in Cambodia, and two
            completely different numbers. Before surveyors go into the
            field to collect data, officials of the Ministry of Planning
            undergo the training required for surveyors. Because there
            is no agreed upon national definition for access to an
            improved water supply, training for is done differently for
            each survey. To resolve the discrepancies between data sets,
            the definitions used for all national surveys regarding
            water supply (and sanitation) must be universal. Once a set
            of definitions is decided upon, these can be widely
            disseminated and training can be standardized for every
            national survey. The report identifies the Ministry of Rural
            Development as the agency best-positioned to take the lead
            in addressing the issues raised in this report, but requires
            strong cooperation from the National Institute of
            Statistics, the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy,
            UNICEF, WHO and others.
