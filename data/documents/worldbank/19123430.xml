and Beyond&#13;
&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of&#13;
16 countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted&#13;
countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in&#13;
place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systems â&#128;&#147; in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the&#13;
African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations&#13;
Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

approach promoted by the Millennium Drinking Water and          reforms, a main aim of which is to transition from the current&#13;
Sanitation Program (PEPAM 2005-2015: Programme Eau              leasing arrangement to full private concession. If this path&#13;

Within the sector there are three challenges:                   with operation and maintenance costs in order to create&#13;
                                                                positive incentives for an expansion of sanitation coverage&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;
turned into services, are:&#13;
&#13;
  Sectorwide&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Simplify and consolidate the institutional organization of the supervisory ministries.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Link and systematize the monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) of physical to financial activities undertaken by those&#13;
     stakeholders intervening in rural areas and ensure the financial monitoring conducted by the Ministry of Finance&#13;
     enables easier identification of subsector flows.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Improve the reliability and forecasting of funding allocated by the government from its own budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Further professionalize the operations of borehole usersâ&#128;&#153; associations (ASUFOR: Association dâ&#128;&#153;usagers de forage).&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Effectively implement delegation of the maintenance of motorized water pumps to the private sector and, from now&#13;
       on, assist the Operations and Maintenance Directorate to realign its assignments and competences.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Put in place a sustainable financing mechanism for the renewal of boreholes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Ensure that the institutional reform currently being prepared doesnâ&#128;&#153;t undermine either the positive performance of&#13;
     the subsector or its financial stability.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Secure more water resources to supply Dakar.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Ensure those interventions aimed at disadvantaged populations are targeted more effectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural sanitation and hygiene&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Build the capacities of the Sanitation Directorate.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Increase the funding allocated to the subsector.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Ensure that the means of intervention and of financing facilities are better aligned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban sanitation and hygiene&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Mobilize the funding required to replace ageing networks and to achieve financial stability.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Change the status of the National Office of Urban Sanitation (ONAS: Office National de lâ&#128;&#153;Assainissement du SÃ©nÃ©gal)&#13;
       from a Public Utility (EPIC) to one with a more autonomous and client-oriented status.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Set up a licensing system for entities providing pit emptying services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                        3&#13;

1.	Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation (WSS) and what its&#13;
member governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 AMCOW&#13;
delegated this task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are&#13;
implementing it in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has been&#13;
produced in collaboration with the Government of Senegal and other stakeholders during 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage in&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation. A synthesis&#13;
report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

Coverage: Assessing Past Progress                              It is to be noted that the definitions and methodologies used&#13;
                                                               by PEPAM and the JMP are not the same, which goes some&#13;
According to data from the Millennium Drinking Water           way in explaining the differences seen in the estimates. In&#13;
and Sanitation Program (PEPAM), Senegal is on track to         particular, for water supply, PEPAM calculates the access&#13;
meet the national targets for drinking water. The access       rate based on a comprehensive inventory of functioning&#13;
rate stood at 85 percent at the end of 2008 with the target    water facilities and an estimate of the number of users per&#13;
set at 90 percent for 2015.3 In contrast, the JMP figures      facility.5 In contrast, the JMP estimates the number of people&#13;
(with an access rate of 69 percent at the end of 2008          with access to the service based on a linear regression of&#13;
for a target of 81 percent in 2015)4 suggest that, if the      the results of nationally representative household surveys,&#13;
current pace is sustained, the Millennium Development          conducted by the National Agency for Statistics and&#13;
Goal (MDG) target for drinking water will be missed by 9       Demography (ANSD) since 1986. For sanitation, there are&#13;
points (see Figure 1).                                         two possible reasons why the PEPAM figures are lower&#13;
                                                               than those of the JMP: first, PEPAM does not consider&#13;
As far as sanitation is concerned, PEPAM estimates an          traditional latrines to be â&#128;&#152;improvedâ&#128;&#153;, whereas some of these&#13;
access rate of 43 percent in 2008 for a target of 70 percent   are considered â&#128;&#152;improvedâ&#128;&#153; by the JMP; second, the JMP,&#13;
in 2015, whereas the JMP estimates a rate of 51 percent        by using the results of household surveys or the national&#13;
in 2008 for a target of 69 percent in 2015. Whilst there       Census, includes those latrines constructed by households&#13;
is a discrepancy between the estimates, they nevertheless      themselves, independent of projects, whereas PEPAM,&#13;
both lead to the same conclusion: the target for sanitation    through its field-based facilities monitoring system, includes&#13;
remains a big challenge.                                       only those facilities built by donors, nongovernmental&#13;

3.	 Reform Context:&#13;
	 Introducing the CSO2 Scorecard&#13;
&#13;
In Senegal, the reform of urban water supply and sanitation        with a GNI per capita above US$50010 (see Figure 3). As a&#13;
in 1996 resulted in the establishment of three entitiesâ&#128;&#148;the        result, Senegal is one of the countries often held up as a&#13;
National Water Company of Senegal (SONES), Senegalese              model within the West African subregion.&#13;
Water (SDE), and the National Office for (urban)&#13;
Sanitation in Senegal (ONAS)â&#128;&#148;to which were attributed              Whilst it is not surprising that Senegal is most often cited&#13;
the responsibilities of the old national water company,            as an example in the West African subregion, in terms of&#13;
SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale dâ&#128;&#153;Exploitation des Eaux du SÃ©nÃ©gal               developing access to water supply services, sanitation still&#13;
(SONEES). This reform also led to institutionalization of          lags behind, particularly in rural areas. Nowhere in Sahelian&#13;
the three consecutive multiyear sector programs (Water             Africa has it been possible to find, then deploy on a large&#13;

This brief introduction puts the service delivery pathway&#13;
in context, which can then be explored in detail using&#13;
the CSO2 scorecard, an assessment tool providing a&#13;
                                                                   Figure 3&#13;

pathway. This scorecard looks at nine building blocks of&#13;
                                                                   developing, and sustaining service delivery, and&#13;
the service delivery pathway, which correspond to specific&#13;
                                                                   peer group comparison&#13;
functions classified in three categories: three functions&#13;
that refer to enabling conditions for putting services in                                      Enabling&#13;
place (policy development, planning new undertakings,&#13;
budgeting); three actions that relate to developing the&#13;
service (expenditure of funds, equity in the use of these&#13;
funds, service output); and three functions that relate to&#13;
sustaining these services (facility maintenance, expansion&#13;
of infrastructure, use of the service).9 Each building block&#13;
is assessed against specific indicators and scored from 1&#13;
(poor) to 3 (excellent) accordingly.&#13;
&#13;
The scorecard results for Senegal show a positive situation,&#13;
not only for enabling conditions (political, legal, strategic,            Sustaining                               Developing&#13;
and programmatic context), but also for sustaining&#13;

Key dates in the reform of the sector in Senegal&#13;
&#13;
 Year	Event&#13;
 1971	    The Compagnie GÃ©nÃ©rale des Eaux du SÃ©nÃ©gal (CGE Senegal), a subsidiary of CGE France, is nationalized and&#13;
          becomes the Senegalese National Company for Water Exploitation (SONEES: SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale dâ&#128;&#153;Exploitation des&#13;
          Eaux du SÃ©nÃ©gal) in charge of water supply and sanitation in urban areas.&#13;
 1981	    The General Directorate responsible for water within the Ministry of Facilities becomes a separate ministry in order&#13;
          to give impetus to the water sector as part of the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade&#13;
          (IDWSS).&#13;
 1983	    Enactment of the Water Code (the decree implementing the provisions of the Water Code will not be promulgated&#13;
          until 1998). SONEES becomes a public service concession undertaking the technical supervision of projects.&#13;
 1996	    SONEES is dissolved and three new companies are created: National Water Company of Senegal (SONES: SociÃ©tÃ©&#13;
          Nationale des Eaux du SÃ©nÃ©gal), Senegalese Water (SDE: SÃ©nÃ©galaise des Eaux) and the National Office of Urban&#13;
          Sanitation (ONAS: Office National de lâ&#128;&#153;Assainissement du SÃ©nÃ©gal).&#13;
 1996-	   The urban water supply sector is reformed and its performance improved as part of the Water Sector Program&#13;
 2002	    (PSE: Programme Sectoriel Eau). Management reform of rural motorized water pumps leads to the sale of water&#13;
 	        by volume and delegation of the service to usersâ&#128;&#153; associations.&#13;
 2002	    The PSE is prolonged by the Long-Term Water Supply Project (PLT: Projet Eau Ã  Long Terme). The WSS sector is&#13;
          identified as a priority in the PRSP (Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper). ONAS launches the Sanitation Program for&#13;
          Peri-urban Areas of Dakar (PAQPUD: Programme dâ&#128;&#153;Assainissement des Quartiers PÃ©ri-Urbains de Dakar) with the&#13;
          support of the World Bank.&#13;
 2003	    Water supply and sanitation, previously entrusted to the Ministry of Mines, Energy and Water, is divided between&#13;
          two ministries, one for rural and the other for urban WSS.&#13;
 	        Creation of a Sanitation Directorate, distinct from that for Water.&#13;
 2005	    Institutionalization of PEPAM, following on from the PLT, which constitutes a programmatic framework for&#13;
          achieving the MDG.&#13;
 	        Sanitation is set up under a ministry for the first time.&#13;
 2008-	   Water supply and sanitation public service law (SPEPA); Sanitation Code; State-ONAS performance contract.&#13;
 2009	    Water and sanitation are reunited under one ministry before being separated once more.&#13;
 2013	    Final year of the SDE lease contract. An institutional reform, called the 3rd generation, should be put in place for&#13;
          urban water supply and sanitation.&#13;

&#13;
   Priority actions for the institutional framework&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Simplify and consolidate institutional organization at the supervisory (ministry) level, by reducing the&#13;
      number of national directorates.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	     Ensure that the next phase of urban sector reform puts a realistic and sustainable solution in place to cope&#13;
          with the increase in demand for water in Dakar and its outlying areas and with the need to renew ONASâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
          capital assets. Make sure that this reform maintains the current financial stability of the urban water&#13;
          supply sector and promotes that of sanitation.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	     Ensure that the implementing provisions of the SPEPA law are adopted.&#13;

 assumption that households will contribute more in terms&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Senegal :
            turning finance into services for 2015 and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The African Ministers' Council on
            Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round
            of Country Status Overviews (CSOs) to better understands
            what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation (WSS)
            and what its member governments can do to accelerate that
            progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). AMCOW
            delegated this task to the World Bank's Water and
            Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are
            implementing it in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in
            over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has been
            produced in collaboration with the Government of Senegal and
            other stakeholders during 2009-10. The analysis aims to help
            countries assess their own service delivery pathways for
            turning finance into water supply and sanitation services in
            each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and
            rural and urban sanitation and hygiene. The CSO2 analysis
            has three main components: a review of past coverage; a
            costing model to assess the adequacy of future investments;
            and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular
            bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway. The
            CSO2's contribution is to answer not only whether past
            trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector
            targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to
            ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated
            coverage in water supply and sanitation. In this spirit,
            specific priority actions have been identified through
            consultation. A synthesis report, available separately,
            presents best practice and shared learning to help realize
            these priority actions.
