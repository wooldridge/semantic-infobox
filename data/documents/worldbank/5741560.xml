                                 I. BACKGROUND GOVERNMENT    AND                      STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
A.         Damages andMacroeconomicImpact&#13;
&#13;
1.         Overall Assessment o f Damages. The tsunami o f December 26, 2004, resulting from an&#13;
earthquake measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale, off the island o f Sumatra, caused severe damage&#13;
to coastal areas o f several countries including India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia and the&#13;
Maldives. In India it caused extensive damage in the Union Territory (UT) o f Andaman &amp;&#13;
Nicobar Islands and along a 2,260 km stretch o f coastline in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil&#13;
Nadu and U T o f Pondicherry. The tidal waves that struck the mainland were 3 to10 meters in&#13;
height and penetrated from 300 meter to 3 km inland. According to Government reports 10,881&#13;
people inIndia lost their lives and 5,792l persons were reportedmissing with 6,913 injured.&#13;
&#13;
2.         At the request of the Government o f India (GOI), the Asian Development Bank (ADB),&#13;
the United Nations (UN) and the World Bank put together a joint team, which undertook an&#13;
assessment o f the tsunami's socioeconomic and environmental impact in the states o f Andhra&#13;
Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu and UT of Pondicherry in February 2005. As advised by the&#13;
GOI, the joint assessment mission did not include an evaluation o f the impact and losses&#13;
sustained inthe Andaman and Nicobar Islands.&#13;
&#13;
3.         Overall damage and losses2inAndhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry are&#13;
estimated at US$1 billion. The largest share occurred in the fisheries (US$568 million) and&#13;
housing (US$229 million) sectors. Damage to productive assets o f fishing communities inTamil&#13;
Nadu and Pondicherry were assessed at US$264 million, o f which US$190.8 million were&#13;
damages to boats and gear and US$73.5 million to infrastructure and services. Tamil Nadu&#13;
suffered the greatest interm o f damage to housing, which was estimated at US$165 million.&#13;
&#13;
4.         An estimated 2.7 million people were affected by the disaster. The majority were from&#13;
fishing communities (80 percent); the remainder worked in agriculture (15 percent), and small&#13;
and micro enterprises (5 percent).                    The impact has accentuated the vulnerability o f coastal&#13;
communities, and exposed a number o f issues that could affect their recovery, such as the&#13;
complexities o f implementing the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification3, the absence o f&#13;
titles as a basis for tenure security, and the continuing decline in fishing industrythat had begun&#13;
before the tsunami.&#13;
&#13;
5.         Macroeconomic Impact. Despite its devastating effect on the coastal areas, the tsunami&#13;
appears to have had virtually no impact on India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or that o f the&#13;
affected states, which ranged from an estimated 0.15 percent o f the Gross State Domestic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
*&#13;
'The  most recent reports indicate that 2,812 people out o f the 5,792 reported missing are dead.&#13;
  Damages (direct impact) refer to the impact o n assets, stock, property, valued at agreed replacement (as opposed to&#13;
reconstruction) unit prices. Losses (indirect impact) refer to income flows that will be affected, such as reduced eamings,&#13;
increased expenditure, etc. over the time period until the assets are recovered. These are quantified at present value.&#13;
  CRZ Notification (adopted in 1991) established four coastal zones depending on respective environmental vulnerability and&#13;
restricts certain activities in each, including construction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                  2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Product (GSDP) in Andhra Pradesh to 2 percent in Tamil Nadu and 9 percent in Pondicherry.&#13;
This is mainly because economic activity along the coastline contributes very little to the states'&#13;
overall economies. A marginal impact on the balance o f payments can be expected in the short&#13;
term, to the extent that shrimp exports and coastal tourism are adversely affected.&#13;
&#13;
6.       The impact on states' public finances i s limited to the expenditure side only. There i s no&#13;
impact on state revenues because the economic activity along the coastline i s largely in the&#13;
informal and unorganized sector. The contribution o f the affected coastal regions to revenues&#13;
such as sales tax, excise, etc. i s relatively insignificant.&#13;
&#13;
7.       While the additional expenditure represents a mere 0.02 percent o f the country's GDP,&#13;
the impact on finances o f the affected states will vary depending on rehabilitation and&#13;
reconstruction requirements. Tsunami-related expenditures are likely to strain the finances o f&#13;
Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry due to much larger damages. For Tamil Nadu, it i s estimated that&#13;
the ratio o f fiscal deficit to GSDP during the reconstruction period (2005/06 - 2007/08) will&#13;
increase slightly - by 0.2     -  0.7 percent. In the case o f Andhra Pradesh, the rehabilitation&#13;
expenditure i s only about 0.1 percent o f the state's GDP and well within its overall budget. Total&#13;
tsunami-related expenditures inPondicherry, over a period o f two to three years, are estimated to&#13;
be as high as 9 percent o f its GDP. However, it i s difficult to assess the fiscal gap inPondicherry&#13;
since any financing shortfalls are met by the GOI.&#13;
&#13;
B.       Reconstruction Needs and Government Response&#13;
&#13;
8.       Immediate Relief Efforts and Government Response.               In response to the crisis,&#13;
governments at all levels have generally acted quickly and effectively. People have been re-&#13;
housed in temporary shelters, and various forms o f humanitarian relief have been provided.&#13;
These included a wide range o f relief packages (food, clothing, etc.), shelter provision in 200&#13;
relief camps and temporary housing, financial assistance for personal needs, health and&#13;
psychological services.     Additional assistance has also been provided by a number o f other&#13;
organizations such as UNICEF, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
9.       In the various affected areas, respective Chief Ministers directed Revenue Department&#13;
officials under the Relief Commissioner to coordinate search, rescue and relief efforts through&#13;
relevant district collectors with assistance from the police force, fire and rescue services, medical&#13;
and health services and all other state government departments. The State Relief Commissioners&#13;
opened control rooms and launched web sites to disseminate information to the public and state&#13;
officials about relief and rescue operations. In addition, 58 relief camps for 44,207 people were&#13;
established in Tamil Nadu and 29 camps for 24,978 people in Kerala. The relief camps in&#13;
Pondicherry and Andhra Pradesh have been closed by n o w as people have left and made their&#13;
own shelter arrangements. State/UT governments have also provided financial assistance to&#13;
families o f the deceased, affected families and the injured and announced subsidies for the repair&#13;
o f housing damages.&#13;
&#13;
 10.     A t the national level, the Ministry o f Home Affairs (MHA) was designated as the nodal&#13;
agency for coordinating relief in the affected states and union territories and formed a control&#13;
room with a help line for the public. The National Crisis Management Group was formed under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the chairmanship of the Secretary, Border Management, MHA. Oversight was carried out by the&#13;
Cabinet Committee of Ministers under the chairmanship o f the Prime Minister. In addition, a&#13;
National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) was established under the chairmanship o f the&#13;
Cabinet Secretary. NCMC's tasks were to draw up ,an emergency plan for relief efforts in the&#13;
affected areas, and review those efforts together with secretaries o f the relevant ministries/&#13;
departments and chiefs o f the armed forces. Teams o f representatives o f various ministries led&#13;
by a Joint Secretary visited the affected states. Individual ministries also undertook specific&#13;
efforts.&#13;
&#13;
 11.      GO1 has also constituted a high level multi-sectoral Core Group for planning and&#13;
coordinating the post-tsunami reconstruction program in the Planning Commission.                                      Overall&#13;
responsibility for the co-ordination o f the Tsunami Reconstruction Program will lie with the&#13;
Office o f the Chief Coordinator (OCC) under the Core Group.                               A total o f Rs 2,822 crore&#13;
(US$649 million) o f funds were allocated to the affected states4 and union territories by the GO1&#13;
including funds released from the National Calamity Contingency Fund (NCCF). Other funds&#13;
have also been announced5.&#13;
&#13;
 12.      The affected states and UT have received corporate donations and relief materials on an&#13;
unprecedented scale. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has estimated that the&#13;
corporate sector in India may have contributed more than US$8 million in cash donations, food&#13;
and medicine, emergency relief supplies and other humanitarian services.                                    Indian private&#13;
businesses and public sector entities have also contributed over US$9 million to the Prime&#13;
Minister's National ReliefFundand have also provided donations to established reliefNGOs.&#13;
&#13;
  13.     The total short (1year) and medium term (2-3 years) reconstructionneeds were estimated&#13;
by the joint assessment mission at US$1.2 billion, the bulk o f which are required for fisheries&#13;
(US$284 million) and housing (US$489 million).&#13;

14.      Government Recovery Stratem. While the GO1 and state/UT governments have&#13;
undertaken effective relief measures, the estimated short and medium term reconstructionneeds&#13;
exceed the immediate financing capacity o f the respective governments as well as that o f the&#13;
NGOs and the private sector. To fill the gap, the GO1has requested assistance from the Bank,&#13;
ADB, the UN, including IFAD, for its post-tsunami recovery program, which encompasses&#13;
livelihood support, micro-enterprises, housing, roads, ports, health, education, environment, and&#13;
coastal protection and risk mitigation. Based on discussions among the three institutions and the&#13;
GOI, an approach for providing reconstruction assistance inthe different sectors was developed&#13;
(Table 2).&#13;

&#13;
15.      The underlying premise o f the govemment's reconstruction program i s that it should be&#13;
used as an opportunity for development. Thus, it i s broadly understood that any reconstruction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
o f infrastructure and buildings would involve up-grading to generally accepted modern&#13;
standards. In locations prone to seismic activity or frequent cyclones, reconstruction will be&#13;
done according to seismic / cyclone resistant standards.&#13;
&#13;
16.     The dramatic events have also revived interest in environmental and hazard risk&#13;
management issues in the coastal areas. Thus, the government's strategy includes evaluation /&#13;
up-grading o f coastal protection measures, further development o f risk management systems and&#13;
establishment o f early waming systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               11. IDARESPONSEAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
A.      Rationalefor Bank's Involvementand Link to the CountryAssistance Strategy&#13;
        (CAS)&#13;
&#13;
17.     The Bank has broad international and India-specific emergency recovery experience         -&#13;
earthquake reconstruction in Gujarat and Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh cyclone recovery;&#13;
earthquake reconstruction in Turkey, El Nino flood reconstruction assistance in Argentina,&#13;
Bolivia, Guyana and Peru, post-flood recovery in Cambodia and China, hurricane recovery&#13;
assistance in the Dominican Republic and Grenada and other countries.               This work has&#13;
invariably been done in collaboration with other intemational and national agencies as well as&#13;
non-governmental organizations. The Bank also has a large portfolio inTamil Nadu. Thus, it i s&#13;
ina uniquepositionto assist GO1and the Governments of Tamil Nadu andPondicherry with the&#13;
proposed reconstruction program.&#13;
&#13;
18.     The Project will contribute to two o f the three pillars o f the Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS) of September 15, 2004. First, it will support improvement o f government effectiveness&#13;
through improved service delivery to the affected coastal communities and their extensive&#13;
involvement in the implementation o f the Project. Second, it supports the development o f rural&#13;
livelihoods (the second CAS pillar) by contributing to the recovery o f fisheries, agriculture and&#13;
animal husbandry infrastructure and identification o f possible alternative livelihood opportunities&#13;
for the coastal communities. In addition, the Project will contribute to address cross-cutting&#13;
environmental and natural hazard issues by (a) enhancing the resistance o f shelter and related&#13;
infrastructure to coastal natural hazards and (b) preparing studies for longer term improvements&#13;
of hazard risk management and the coastal environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.      IDA Strategy&#13;
&#13;
19.     At the request o f the GOI, the Bank has agreed to propose financing the Emergency&#13;
Reconstructionproject mainly through a redeployment o f savings from 15 IDA-financedprojects&#13;
involving a total o f US$410 million supplemented by a further US$55 million as new IDA&#13;
resources. This total o f US$465 million would be usedto finance critical reconstructionneeds in&#13;
Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry, which suffered most severely from effects of the tsunami. In&#13;
addition, as part o f a wider post-tsunami assistance strategy, several supplementary support&#13;
efforts are proposed as follows: (a) utilizing proceeds from two ongoing projects in Andhra&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Pradesh involving US$40 million in IDA financing for essential reconstruction activities in that&#13;
state; (b) utilizing US$lO million inIDA financing from an ongoing rural water supply project in&#13;
Kerala to help cover the needs o f affected communities in that state; (c) establishment o f a&#13;
special tsunami-related trust fund involving grants totaling about US$2.5 million from the&#13;
Bank's net income for priority policy work in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry. An ongoing roads&#13;
project in Tamil Nadu, financed with a Bank loan will partially cover (US$11 million) that&#13;
state's needs in the sector.     It is expected that NGOs will also provide some resources for&#13;
housing and repair or purchase o f boats in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry; no estimates o f their&#13;
contributions are available as yet.&#13;
&#13;
20.     Risk mitigation aspects o f the reconstruction strategy will focus on cyclones and floods&#13;
as well as the tsunami.        Therefore, preparation o f this Project was carried out in close&#13;
consultation with the team preparing the proposed Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project; co-&#13;
ordination o f effort will continue throughout implementation.&#13;
&#13;
C.      Lessons Learned&#13;
&#13;
21.     The experience o f previous disaster management operations in India, particularly in the&#13;
Andhra Pradesh Hazard Mitigation and Emergency Cyclone Recovery Project and the&#13;
Emergency Earthquake Reconstruction Projects in Maharashtra and Gujarat, has provided&#13;
several lessons. First, while it i s important to build in hazard risk management systems, these&#13;
need to be separated from emergency reconstruction activities as they require a much longer&#13;
implementation schedule.       The proposed Project focuses on addressing the more immediate&#13;
reconstruction needs, while undertaking only background studies that are necessary for&#13;
developing longer term improvements in coastal management. Second, flexibility in approach,&#13;
high client ownership and political commitment are essential elements for successful&#13;
implementation. The GO1/ state government commitment and ownership have been very strong&#13;
throughout project preparation. Flexibility in project implementation will be ensured through&#13;
piloting different project activities and through continuous review and adjustment o f the program&#13;
on the basis o f actual experience.&#13;
&#13;
22.     Experience o f the Bank supported emergency operations in other countries underscores&#13;
the potential risk o f undertaking massive multi-sectoral reconstruction programs involving&#13;
numerous local and international actors, which can easily strain local capacity. This would be&#13;
mitigated by focusing on essential elements, piloting where needed before scaling up, and&#13;
providing built-in flexibility to drop activities that may prove problematic, or shifting resources&#13;
to more successful components.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   111. THEPROPOSEDPROJECT&#13;
&#13;
A.      Project Objectives&#13;
&#13;
23.     The Project will support the efforts o f the governments o f India, Tamil Nadu and&#13;
Pondicherry to revive livelihoods and promote recovery inthe tsunami-affected areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B.       ProjectDescription&#13;
&#13;
24.      The Project would provide support in (a) Tamil Nadu for reconstruction o f housing and&#13;
public buildings and for revival o f livelihoods infisheries, agriculture and animal husbandry; (b)&#13;
Pondicherry for housing reconstruction and revival o f livelihoods in fisheries and agriculture,&#13;
and (c) both Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry in capacity building in housing reconstruction and&#13;
coastal zone management along with technical assistanceto implement the program.&#13;
&#13;
25.      Total project cost i s estimated at US$682.8 million, including contingencies, o f which&#13;
US$465.0 million, or about 68 percent, would be provided through IDA funding. The remaining&#13;
US$217.8 million, or about 32 percent, would be providedby the Government. The estimated&#13;
cost o f different components will be reviewed regularly with GO1 and the project states and&#13;
adapted to changing financing that may become available from different sources, particularly&#13;
funding available from the non-government sectors. Following is a brief description of the&#13;
project components and sub-components:&#13;
&#13;
26.      Component 1: Housing Reconstruction (US$596.8 million, about 87.5% o f total). This&#13;
component will have three sub-components: (i)provision o f transit shelter as needed and&#13;
upgrading of services in temporary shelter sites (US$5.9 million); (ii)   repair and reconstruction&#13;
of existing houses, construction o f new houses, and the necessary related services and&#13;
community infrastructure such as access roads, internal roads, water supply, latrines, storm&#13;
drains, electrification, rain water harvesting structures, and limited community infrastructure&#13;
facilities such as community halls, anganwadi (nursery schools), primary schools, etc. in the&#13;
habitations (US$571.5 million); and (iii)    resettlement o f the families affected by the Project&#13;
(US$19.4 million).&#13;
&#13;
27.      In-situhousing reconstruction would be pursued to the extent possible. Most housing&#13;
construction will be carried out by the beneficiaries either through individual effort which i s the&#13;
case in Pondicherry or through Self-Help Groups (SHGs) as is the case in Tamil Nadu. Yet,&#13;
allowance i s made for public-private partnerships and direct contracting by the public&#13;
departmentdagencies to respond to particular situations where such approaches may be more&#13;
effective.&#13;
&#13;
28.      The Project i s expected to help repair or reconstruct about 140,000 damaged houses in&#13;
Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry. Provision for resettlement o f an estimated 3,000 families who&#13;
may be affected by the removal o f encroachment on government owned land for housing the&#13;
tsunami affected people in Chennai, i s also made in the Project. Project activities may result in&#13;
additional need for resettlement o f families who were not affected by the tsunami. However, the&#13;
number of such cases i s expected to be rather small. A clear picture will emerge when the&#13;
beneficiary surveys are completed and their choices are incorporated in sub-project formulation.&#13;
Inall cases resettlement will be carried out in accordance with the principles and guidelines o f&#13;
the agreed Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), and Resettlement Plans&#13;
will be prepared based on the findings o f the social screening o f sub-projects. (Detailed&#13;
description o f the component i s provided inAttachment1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29.    Component 2: Restoration o f Livelihoods (US36.4 million, about 5% o f total). The&#13;
Project would help restore livelihoods o f affected families through two sub-components:&#13;
(i)    assistance to fisheries (US$25.5 million) which will include (a) restoration o f damaged&#13;
       fisheries infrastructure, such as harbors, patrol boats, clearing bar mouth and estuaries to&#13;
       maintain estuarine habitats, and aquaculture infrastructure; and (b) reestablishment o f&#13;
       safety-at-sea systems/services (detailed description i s provided inAttachment 2); and&#13;
(ii)   assistance to agriculture, horticulture and livestock (US$10.9 million), which will&#13;
       include: (a) restoration o f damaged agricultural lands (about 9,300 ha) and horticultural&#13;
       lands (670 ha), farm ponds and dug wells; (b) repair/ reconstruction o f damaged&#13;
       infrastructure such as veterinary dispensaries and veterinary extension centers and the&#13;
       upgrading o f veterinary care services through training to the community based veterinary&#13;
       workers and farmers in animal husbandry activities; and (c) promotion o f sustainable&#13;
       management o f coastal land andwater resources.&#13;
&#13;
30.     Component 3: Public Buildings and Public Works (US19.5 million, about 3% o f total).&#13;
This component would provide financing for small public works such as repair, reconstruction&#13;
and upgrading o f damaged hospitals, public health centersisub-centers, educational institutions&#13;
(about 90 numbers), cyclone shelters (about 120 numbers) and other public buildings, restoration&#13;
o f damaged river and drain banks (about 100 km), and plantationheplanting o f mangroves (400&#13;
ha) and shelter belts (2,000 ha) inTamil Nadu.&#13;
&#13;
31,     Component 4: Technical Assistance and Training (US$11.1million, about 1.5% o f total).&#13;
This component would finance:&#13;
    (a) technical assistance and capacity building for housing reconstruction. This will include&#13;
        specialized help in the preparation o f detailed project reports, land management,&#13;
        resettlement layouts and related infrastructure plans, training o f masons in hazard&#13;
        resistance construction technologies. Assistance may also be provided in the restoration&#13;
        and restitution o f boundaries and land/plot rights and titling in situ, surveying, mapping,&#13;
        land use zoning and demarcation;&#13;
    (b) preparationo f social and environmentalmanagement plans inaccordance with ESMF;&#13;
    (c) community participation efforts to ensure involvement o f the affected communities,&#13;
        especially the most vulnerable groups, in planning, deciding, implementing and&#13;
        monitoring the housing reconstruction and livelihoods programs. This will also include&#13;
        facilitation o f voluntary relocation and settlement in an equitable, efficient and socially&#13;
        accepted manner, raising awareness and dissemination o f information about the project&#13;
        activities to ensure transparency and accountability during implementation. In addition&#13;
        the grievance redress mechanism will be strengthened;&#13;
    (d) studies to assess the vulnerabilities and longer term issues associated with coastal zone&#13;
       protection; environmental studies on coastal water quality, ground water quality,&#13;
       pollution o f tidal influenced water bodies in urban areas and capacity building among&#13;
        various stake holders and hazard risk management.         Special focus would be given to&#13;
        seriously impacted areas such as - the Nagapattinam district o f Tamil Nadu and Karaikal&#13;
        region o f Pondicherry; and&#13;
    (e) updating the management plans under the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification by&#13;
        demarcating High Tide Line (HTL) and evolving an Integrated Coastal Zone&#13;
       Management Plan (ICZMP) for selected stretches o f the coast line.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32.     Component 5: Implementation Support (US$19.0 million, about 3% o f total).           This&#13;
component would help finance the project management and incremental operating costs such as:&#13;
   (a) quality assurance and technical audits to ensure adequate quality o f reconstructionworks.&#13;
        This sub-component will be outsourced to competent NGOs, technical agencies, and/or&#13;

&#13;
A.      ImplementationArrangements(Attachment3)&#13;
&#13;
33.     As previously noted at the national level the OCC has been tasked with the role o f the&#13;
secretariat o f the GOI's Core Group and has the overall responsibility for the coordination o f the&#13;
reconstruction program. The execution o f the Project will, however, lie with line departments/&#13;
agencies at state/UT level.&#13;
&#13;
34.     InTamil Nadu, the government carries out disaster management throughthe Office o fthe&#13;
State Relief Commissioner. It will include a Project Management Unit (PMU) responsible for&#13;
the coordination and monitoring o f the implementing line departmentdagencies such as the&#13;
Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB), the Offices o f the District Collectors, Department&#13;
of Rural Development, Fisheries Department, Agriculture Department, Horticulture Department,&#13;
Environment and Forestry Department, Public Works Department (PWD), and other. A state&#13;
level Steering Committee chaired by the Chief Secretary or Development Commissioner and&#13;
consisting o f the representatives o f the implementing agencies will be established for policy&#13;
advice and coordination. An Empowered Committee will be constituted to provide all requisite&#13;
approvals.&#13;
&#13;
35.     In Pondicherry,      all implementation responsibilities   will lie with the Project&#13;
Implementation Agency (PIA). The PIA will be supervised and monitored by a State Level&#13;
Empowered Committee (SLEC) consisting o f high-level representatives o f the state institutions.&#13;
Field level monitoring will be facilitated by two Regional Project Monitoring Committee offices&#13;
-inPondicherry and inKaraikal-consistingoftop representatives ofthe involvedtechnical&#13;
bodies.&#13;
&#13;
36.     Quality Assurance and Technical Audit will be carried through independent consultants&#13;
contracted by the PMU in Tamil Nadu and the State Level Empowered Committee in&#13;
Pondicheny.&#13;
&#13;
37.     NGO coordination:       NGO activities are largely in the livelihood sectors with some&#13;
interest in housing reconstruction.      Interface between the NGOs and government i s being&#13;
handled at the district level by the District Collector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38.     Project Supervision. A coordinated supervision effort will be undertaken with the other&#13;
multilateral agencies, such as ADB, UN and International Fund for Agricultural Development&#13;
(IFAD) involved in project financing.       Modalities of the coordination arrangements will be&#13;
worked out by the Bank with the multilateral agencies inconsultationwith GO1and the states.&#13;
&#13;
B.      Community Consultation,PublicCommunication,GrievanceRedress&#13;
        (Attachment4)&#13;
&#13;
39.     Intemational experience o f post-disaster reconstruction has shown that no amount o f&#13;
policy initiatives, financial assistance, and technical know how will be effective without a system&#13;
to convey their content swiftly and equitably to the affected public, and to hear and assess their&#13;
suitability and sustainability within communities. In order to facilitate participatory and&#13;
consultative processes, a two-way communication mechanism needs to be in place. It must&#13;
convey information from the government to individuals, and also be able to collect and channel&#13;
community views back to policy-makers. Most important, it must give voice to poor, vulnerable,&#13;
and marginalized sections. A transparency strategy would enable communities to certify that&#13;
beneficiaries have been correctly identified, monitor the progress o f work, oversee the inflow&#13;
and disbursal o f funds and materials, and understand the rationale and process o f policies and&#13;
decisions,   This implies both a ground-level communications network, and a mechanism to&#13;
integrate ground feedback into policy.       In both Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry, representative&#13;
village level committees will function as the consultative mechanism.&#13;
&#13;
40.     The governments of Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry have set up mechanisms to facilitate&#13;
communication, transparency, and grievance redress. These will be strengthened and made more&#13;
systematic in order to play a strategic and enhanced role through the duration o f the&#13;
reconstructionprogram.&#13;
&#13;
41.     Village-level monitoring committees will function as the first information node and&#13;
grievance redress tier. A second-tier will operate at the district or regional level. Full time&#13;
officers  in the project implementing units will oversee communication, transparency and&#13;
consultative activities, as well as monitor the functioning o f the grievance redress system.&#13;
&#13;
C.      Procurement(Attachment5)&#13;
&#13;
42.     Procurement will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines:&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated M a y 2004 (Procurement Guidelines),&#13;
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated M a y&#13;
2004 (Consultants Guidelines), and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement.              A&#13;
procurement plan will be prepared within 30 days of the effective date o f the Credit and will be&#13;
up-dated at least annually.&#13;
&#13;
43.     The Bank's prior review will be required for all ICB contracts irrespective o f value, the&#13;
first two contracts awarded on Direct Contracting basis by each implementing agency and all&#13;
contracts awarded under Direct Contracting above US$30,000. The first two contracts o f each&#13;
implementing agency and all NCB contracts for works over US$750,000 or equivalent, all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
contracts for hiring of consultants over US$lOO,OOO      for firms and US$50,000 for individuals&#13;
shall also be subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
44.     Procurement activities will be carried out by the relevant departmentdagencies such as&#13;
TNSCB, Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB), Department o f Rural Development (DRD),&#13;
Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB), PWD and Departments&#13;
o f Fisheries, Agriculture, Horticulture and Animal Husbandry in Tamil Nadu, and the Project&#13;
Implementation Agency (PIA) to be established in Pondicherry.             CMWSSB has recently&#13;
executed a Bank financed project and i s fully conversant with Bank's procurement guidelines&#13;
and procedures. The Bank will provide training workshops for all the departmentdagencies.&#13;
&#13;
D.      Disbursementand FinancialManagement(Attachment6)&#13;
&#13;
45.     In Tamil Nadu project implementation arrangements will be based on the existing&#13;
government systems o f fund-flow, accounting, reporting and audit, while inPondicherry a new legal&#13;
entity - PIA -will be established with its own bank account, accounting, reporting and auditing&#13;
arrangements.     Detailed procedures for the financial management and funds flow will be&#13;
provided inthe Project ImplementationPlan (PIP) for Tamil Nadu and inthe Operations Manual&#13;
(OM) for Pondicherry. These are underpreparation and will be finalized within 45 days after the&#13;
credit effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
46.     Flow o f Funds. IDA financing would be routed through GO1 to the governments o f&#13;
Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry. The GO1planned to modify the existing on lendterms (70% loan&#13;
and 30% grant) to an arrangement where the terms to the states would effectively be the same as&#13;
IDA. The terms and implementation arrangements are yet to be finalized. A single Special&#13;
Account (SA) would be established with the Reserve Bank o f India. Replenishments o f the SA&#13;
will be made against monthly claims. The funds received by the State Finance Department in&#13;
Tamil Nadu will be allocated to the various spending units (implementingdepartmentdagencies,&#13;
district collectors, etc.) through the budget using the treasury mechanism, and thereafter to the&#13;
beneficiaries and/or contractors. InPondicherry the funds will be passed from the UT'Sbudget&#13;
to the PIA as grant-in aid, which will handle the financial arrangements thereafter.&#13;
&#13;
47.     Retroactive Financing (US$30.0 million) would cover eligible expenditures incurred&#13;
between March 23, 2005 (completion o f appraisal) and date o f signing o f the legal agreement&#13;
towards the construction o f transit shelters, improvement works in temporary shelter sites, land&#13;
reclamation, technical assistance, repair/ reconstruction o f houses (initial installment) and the&#13;
project management for implementation in Tamil Nadu and reconstruction o f houses (initial&#13;
installment), reclamation o f agricultural land and project management inPondicherry.&#13;
&#13;
48.     Reporting:    The PMU/PIA will prepare and submit to the IDA quarterly Financial&#13;
Monitoring Reports (FMRs) as part o f the Quarterly Progress Reports (QPR) in an agreed&#13;
format. The first such report will be prepared for the period ending September 30,2005. Annual&#13;
external audits will be carried out by the state Accountant General (AG) inTamil Nadu and half-&#13;
yearly audits by an experienced auditor acceptable to IDA inPondicherry. Inaddition, quarterly&#13;
internal audits will be conducted by an experienced private audit firm acceptable to IDA under&#13;
agreed Terms o f Reference (TOR) inTamil Nadu.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49.    Considering the nature o f the operation and the fact that large expenditures will be&#13;
incurred within a span o f 2 to 3 years, apart from financial audits, a number o f additional&#13;
measures will be adopted to strengthenfiduciary oversight. These include quality assurance and&#13;
technical audits by the third parties (para 37 above), public information dissemination and&#13;
redress mechanisms that would facilitate vigilance by stakeholders as well.&#13;
&#13;
50.    Financial Covenants. The following covenants agreed with the government during the&#13;
negotiations, are proposed:&#13;
           The PMU/PIA shall submit annual audited financial statements o f the operations in&#13;
           Tamil Nadu by September 30 each year, and half-yearly financial statements for&#13;
           operations inPondicherry audited by the external auditor by December 31&amp; June 30.&#13;
           The PMU/PIA in Tamil Nadu shall appoint an audit firm, acceptable to IDA, for&#13;
           internal audit under agreed terms o f reference. The firm would prepare quarterly&#13;
           internal audit reports, and the same will be furnishedto IDA within 45 days from the&#13;
           end o f each quarter.&#13;
           The PMU/PIA shall submit FMRsto IDA inagreed formats within 30 days o fthe end&#13;
           o f the quarter.  The first FMR will cover the period from March 23, 2005 to&#13;
           September 30, 2005.&#13;
&#13;
51.     IDA Supervision. This Project will require intensive supervision to ensure satisfactory&#13;
implementation o f arrangements put in'place for financial accountability and proper usage o f&#13;
funds.&#13;

52.     The proposed Project will include a significant amount o f construction work, particularly&#13;
housing.    The extent o f this work related activities suggest that the Bank policy on&#13;
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) may apply. The proposed livelihoods restoration program,&#13;
which includes agriculture sector activities, may lead to the use o f agricultural chemicals,&#13;
including pesticides. Therefore, applicability o f the policy on Pest Management (OP 4.09) will&#13;
be determined during the sub-project screening process as outlined in the ESMF. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
emergency operation may pose limited risks to some cultural property. Therefore, sub-projects&#13;
will be reviewed for their potential impact on cultural property and clear procedures will be&#13;
required for identification, protection o f cultural property from theft, and treatment o f discovered&#13;
artifacts, and will be included instandard biddingdocuments.&#13;
&#13;
53.      The Bank policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) will apply as the&#13;
reconstructiono f houses and community infrastructure in areas o f highvulnerability will involve&#13;
substantial private land acquisition and associated resettlement. The likely land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement impact will be determined through a detailed assessment, including an assessment&#13;
of the impact on the tribal population, if determined to be necessary.&#13;
&#13;
54.      The E S M F prepared by the states provided the guidelines and principles for addressing&#13;
environmental and social assessments/impacts through sub-project screening. All proposed sub-&#13;
projects will be screened to ensure that the environmental and social risks are adequately&#13;
addressed through the application o f standardized guidelines and codes o f practice or through&#13;
sub-project-specific management and mitigation plans (for more details see Attachment 7).&#13;
&#13;
P.       Monitoringand Evaluation(Attachment8)&#13;
&#13;
55.      The OCC will have overall responsibility for monitoring and evaluation, while specific&#13;
monitoring and evaluation activities will be carried out by PMU and the implementing&#13;
departmentdagencies in Tamil Nadu and SLEUPIA inPondicherry. Quarterly Progress Reports&#13;
(QPR) would be prepared and submitted to IDA by the PMU in Tamil Nadu and SLEC/PIA in&#13;
Pondicherry, based o n information provided by the different implementing departmentdagencies&#13;
and verified by them.          In addition, QPRs will indicate actual or potential issues in&#13;
implementation and identify remedial actions required.&#13;
&#13;
56.      Project monitoring will cover disbursements, physical progress under each component,&#13;
effectiveness and sustainability o f the assistance (for details see Attachment 8).&#13;
&#13;
57.      Monitoringand evaluation o f the above indicators will be carried out intwo main forms:&#13;
     (a) continuous monitoring and assessment of the project's financial and technical&#13;
         performance through quarterly progress reports, and social and environmental impact&#13;
         assessments as outlined inESMF; and&#13;
     (b) Project impact assessments through surveys at mid-term and upon completion.&#13;

HOUSING    DAMAGES LOSSES  AND&#13;
&#13;
1.       The tsunami o f December 26, 2004 damaged more than 140,000 housing units in 13&#13;
coastal districts o f the state o f Tamil Nadu and 2 regions o f the Union Territory o f Pondicherry6&#13;
(Table A1-1). Fishing families were affected the most followed by agriculture households.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Based on information and discussions with the Government o f Tamil Nadu and the UT o f&#13;
Pondicherry, the total damages to the housing units were estimated by the Joint Assessment&#13;
Mission7 to amount to Rs 900 crore or US$207 million, including US$33 million o f personal&#13;
property losses. Most o f the damage and losses occurred inTamil Nadu accounting for US$195&#13;
million (Table Al-1.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         ASSUMPTIONS: The average cost of pucca housing was assumed to be Rs 120,000 in Tamil&#13;
         Nadu and Rs 160,000 inPondicherry. The costs o f kachcha housing were assumed to be equal to&#13;
         30 percent o f the costs o f pucca housing. In Pondicherry and Tamil Nadu, all kachcha housing&#13;
         was assumed to be fully damaged. The cost o f partially damaged housing was assumed to be&#13;
         equal to 35 percent o f the total cost o f apucca house. The costs o f lost household items were&#13;
         assumed to be Rs 10,000 per family on average and to have occurred to all families who had their&#13;
         housing damaged.&#13;
         Source: Preliminary Damage and Needs Assessment by ADB, UNand the World Bank (March 8, 2005).&#13;
&#13;
3.       The cost o f reconstruction would exceed the estimated damages as housing&#13;
reconstruction to higher standards would be according o f hazard resistance and better services.&#13;
The total estimated housing reconstruction needs including the civic amenities and community&#13;
infrastructure in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry i s US$596.8 million, US$383.8 million o f which&#13;
will be financed     under the proposedProject. The balance (US$213.0 million) shallbe fundedby&#13;
the GO1and the state governments.&#13;
&#13;
GOVERNMENT         HOUSING      POLICY FOR POST-TSUNAMI             RECONSTRUCTION&#13;
&#13;
4.       The governments o f Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry have announced housing&#13;
reconstruction strategies that outline standards for the housing units to be reconstructed and&#13;
requirements for and terms o frelocation. They have also confirmed that all new development in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6Theaffected districts in Tamil Nadu are Tiruvallur, Chennai, Kancheepuram, Villupuram, Cuddalore, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur,&#13;
Nagapattinam, Pudukottai, Ramanathapuram, Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli and Kanniyakumari. In Pondicherry UT, the Karaikal&#13;
region andPondicherryregionwere severely affected.&#13;
'JointAssessmentMissionwas undertakenduring February 1-15,2005 by a team of experts fromthe AsianDevelopmentBank,&#13;
UnitedNations andthe World Bank. The Reportwas finalizedon March 8, 2005.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the respective territories will have to be consistent with the relevant Coastal Zone Management&#13;
Plans approvedby the Coastal Zone Management Authority. Accordingly, new constructionwill&#13;
be permitted in the `no-development zone' provided it i s consistent with the CRZ Notification.&#13;
Affected families are encouraged by the government to relocate beyond the High Tide Line&#13;
(HTL) and construct a permanent housing structure with assistance from the government. In&#13;
Pondicherry, relocation beyond 500m of HTL will be accepted by the Government only in cases&#13;
where the whole village/habitation was destroyed and with consent o f fisher panchayatdvillage&#13;
elders, Both governments envisaged in situ repairs to partially damaged housing.&#13;
&#13;
5.      The designs of the housing units shall be made not only in conformity with the building&#13;
design codes for earthquake and cyclone resistant structures, but also in terms o f functionality,&#13;
aesthetics and from the view point o f the use o f locally available materials.      Whereas the&#13;
beneficiaries could have their own designof the housing unit, the states will nevertheless, offer a&#13;
wide range o f choices to the beneficiaries and these will be documented in the Project&#13;
Implementation Plan (PIP). Pondicherry will inform beneficiaries through the housing policy&#13;
document.     However, selection o f a design out o f the Government offered designs i s not a&#13;
mandatory requirement for availing assistance.&#13;
&#13;
6.      In all cases of relocation in Tamil Nadu, families will be required to relinquish their&#13;
rights to previously owned or occupied property.          Tsunami affected people who agree to&#13;
surrender their titled lands voluntarily and opt for new housing will be eligible to receive&#13;
compensation for additional land beyond the area o f new house offered to them.                The&#13;
compensation will be paid for additional lands using the same procedures for acquiring private&#13;
lands for project activities. At the same time they will receive a title in the new locations. In&#13;
Tamil Nadu new property titles will be registered inthe name o f woman and man in the family.&#13;
The same policy will be encouraged in Pondicherry. The two governments have also developed&#13;
specific standards for the newly constructed housing (Table A1-2.).&#13;

&#13;
7.      Both the governments have issued policy o n public-private partnerships (including&#13;
NGOs) that provide certain standarddcriteria to the NGOs such as a minimum size o f a&#13;
community/number of houses to be constructed and compliance with the above reconstruction&#13;
standards established by the governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CRITICAL ISSUES&#13;
&#13;
8.      Link between housing and employment. The hardest hit groups were fishing communities&#13;
who suffered extensive damage to their housing and boats. As the link between housing and&#13;
employment in fishing i s very strong, any measures that affect housing location have immediate&#13;
implications for the livelihoods o f such families.&#13;
&#13;
9.      Lack of land titles. Many o f the occupants o f the damaged housing did not have titles to&#13;
their property. Instead, "ownership" rights are essentially vested inthe community and the value&#13;
o f housing derives mostly from its proximity to the fishing area rather than the quality o f the&#13;
dwelling. Under such circumstances, it is difficult for such families to move away from their&#13;
location or to shift to different forms o f employment because the wealth they have accumulated&#13;
infishing gear or housinghasmostlybeenlost.&#13;
&#13;
10.     Restriction on building by the sea. The issue i s complicated by the fact that most fishing&#13;
families live within the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ), promulgated in 1991, which proscribes&#13;
and/or restricts construction within 200m from the HTL inZone-111. At the same time, the rights&#13;
o f those whose dwellings were constructed prior to the adoption o f the CRZ are not clear and&#13;
need to be examined.&#13;
&#13;
11.     The above issues will be addressed by the Government through (a) the information,&#13;
education and communication program; (b) selection o f relocation sites with consultation with&#13;
the community and making relocation voluntary for the tsunami affected families; (c) provision&#13;
o f infrastructure at beaches for the fishermen to safe keep their boats and other related fishing&#13;
equipment and gear; and (d) actively promoting alternate livelihood support.&#13;
&#13;
DESCRIPTION THE COMPONENT&#13;
                OF&#13;
&#13;
12.      The total cost o f this component i s US$596.8 million and it will include three sub-&#13;
components: (i)   provision of transit shelters to facilitate in-situ reconstruction and improvement&#13;
and upgrading o f services inthe existing temporary shelter sites (US$5.9 million); (ii) and&#13;
                                                                                           repair&#13;
reconstruction o f houses and related services and community infrastructure (US$57 1.5 million);&#13;
and (iii)resettlement o f families affected by the Project (US$19.4 million).&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component1a:&#13;
13.      This subcomponent will be usedinTamil Nadu only.&#13;
&#13;
14.      Transit shelters (US$4.5 million): One o f the mainthrusts o f the proposedProject is to&#13;
support the household-driven in situ reconstruction process to the extent possible.             Such&#13;
approach would ensure beneficiary ownership, support restoration o f livelihoods through&#13;
provision o f local employment as well as contribute to the process o f psychological recovery&#13;
from the effects o f disaster. Therefore, families undertaking their own housing reconstruction&#13;
will need temporary shelters near their houses to be able to undertake or manage/supervise the&#13;
works. The transit shelters are proposed for the affected families who opt to reconstruct house&#13;
in-situ and did not receive any financial assistance for construction o f temporary shelters. The&#13;
transit shelter will be constructed within the premises o f the damaged house subject to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
availability o f space. Otherwise, the transit shelter will be constructed in the proximity o f the&#13;
housing site on public/community land so that the house owner could actively participate/&#13;
supervise the reconstruction o f own house. The GOTN argued that this small provision will&#13;
induce the affected people to reconstruct in-situ, thus not get alienated from the society inwhich&#13;
they have been residing. The Bank team also felt that an expenditure o f about US$220 per&#13;
transit shelter would have a potential to save a large expenditure (land, services, community&#13;
infrastructure o n an average per house will cost about US$1,700) needed on account o f&#13;
relocation o f a house. The GOTN proposed to use direct contracting procedures with reputed&#13;
NGOs for constructing these houses.&#13;
&#13;
15.     Improvementhpgradation of basic services in temporary shelter sites (US$1.4&#13;
million). About 27,000 tsunami affected families have been housed in clusters o f temporary&#13;
shelters at about 300 locations by the Government and NGOs during the emergency relief&#13;
operations.   As it now appears that these affected families will have to stay longer in the&#13;
temporary shelters as reconstruction o f permanent houses has not yet commenced,&#13;
improvement/provision o f basic services such as water supply, sanitation, solid waste&#13;
management system, storm drains and some community facilities are needed. These services are&#13;
proposed to be procured by using shopping or national competitive biddingprocedures.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component1b: HousingReconstruction(US$571.5 million)&#13;
16.     Funding will be provided for repair o f partially damaged houses and reconstruction o f&#13;
fully damaged houses and related services and community infrastructure in the habitation.&#13;
Beneficiaries o f the housing reconstructionprogram under this subcomponent will be households&#13;
affected by the tsunami only.        The Project together with the GO1 funding will finance&#13;
construction o f a core house comprising one/two room(s), a kitchen and a toilet.              The&#13;
beneficiaries could construct a bigger house or a smaller house. In case o f a bigger house, the&#13;
overall assistance will be subject to maximum entitlement. Ifthe house i s smaller than 300 sq. ft.&#13;
in rural areas, the entitlement will be reduced correspondingly. Eligible beneficiaries will be&#13;
identified during the enumeration survey to be conductedjointly by the District Collector and a&#13;
representative o f the local authority and community representative. Upon completion, the house&#13;
will be registered in the name o f both spouses. In addition, to facilitate better hazard risk&#13;
mitigation in the future, insurance o f the house against different hazards will also be promoted&#13;
underthe Project.&#13;
&#13;
17.     Housing reconstruction will be carried out in-situto the extent possible. However, there&#13;
will be cases where relocation o fthe beneficiaries will be required. This will be determined on a&#13;
case by case basis and carried out in accordance with ESMF. Accordingly, the government has&#13;
already started assessing potential relocation areas, and a number o f available public plots have&#13;
been identified. Land acquisition will be financed partly by the GO1and partly by the state/UT&#13;
governments. Housing construction will be carried out mainly by the beneficiaries. However, in&#13;
certain cases it may involve public-private partnerships and contracting by the public&#13;
departments/ agencies:&#13;
&#13;
(a) Homeowner-driven Housing Reconstruction. Experience with post-disaster reconstruction in&#13;
    Turkey, Mexico and Colombia indicate that the most feasible and sustainable option i s in-situ&#13;
    reconstruction managed by the affected households who were provided with assistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    and/or loans. India's own experience with housing reconstructionafter the earthquake inthe&#13;
    state o f Gujarat, and the successful involvement o f Self-Help Groups (SHGs) in the socio-&#13;
    economic development o f the group members particularly in Tamil Nadu, support the&#13;
    rationale and the feasibility of this approach. Homeowner-driven construction through SHGs&#13;
    has an additional benefit o f contributing to a revival o f the local communities through the&#13;
    creation o fjobs for the local skilled and unskilled labor. Assistance to the SHGs on behalf o f&#13;
    beneficiaries will be provided in phases based on the progress o f the construction to be&#13;
    verified by project engineers and villagel SHG representatives in accordance with an MOU&#13;
    to be signed between the SHG and the government representative.&#13;
&#13;
(b) Public-Private Partnerships. Experience in post-disaster reconstruction indicates that there&#13;
    are households who are not able to undertake reconstruction o f their housing. Inthese cases&#13;
    public-private partnerships would be established upon the beneficiaries' written request&#13;
    where the respective departments/ agencies would contract the builders, NGOs, etc. and&#13;
    supervise works on the beneficiary's behalf. A number o f NGOs have expressed interest in&#13;
    providing assistance in the reconstructionprocess and the state governments have welcomed&#13;
    such initiatives and announced common ground rules. The district Collector will provide the&#13;
    interface between the NGOs and the government. As most NGOs have little expertise in&#13;
    provision o f services and infrastructure, PPPs would be established with NGOs (foundations,&#13;
    private entities, etc.) where housing would be provided by the NGO and infrastructure by the&#13;
    public sector.&#13;
&#13;
(c) Public Construction in Chennai. Due to the limited availability o f land in Chennai, multi-&#13;
    family/ multi-storey (ground plus 2) housing will be built for beneficiaries in high density&#13;
    locations. As the construction o f such housing would be beyond the capacity o f beneficiary&#13;
    household, it will be constructed by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB)&#13;
    through a competitive bidding process. It i s estimated that 23,800 new such units will be&#13;
    required in Chennai.      Urban housing reconstruction in 5 other locations with less land&#13;
    constraints will follow the SHG and/ or PPP approaches.&#13;
&#13;
18.     N e w housing will be constructed and services provided in accordance with uniform&#13;
standards developed by the GOI. However, GO1and Bank financing will be provided for a core&#13;
house o f a maximum size o f 300 sq. ft. and up to Rs. 120,000 (US$2,740) per housing unit. In&#13;
the case o f multi-unit buildings in Chennai, standard designs o f TNSCB will be used. For the&#13;
SHG/ owner-built units a number o f standard unit layouts and engineering plans as well as bills&#13;
o f materials and costs will be prepared and made available to the SHGheneficiaries to select.&#13;
For other designs a separate review and approval by the respective state/UT government&#13;
agencies will be required. Technical assistance for the implementation o f this sub-component&#13;
such as training o f masons inhazard resistant construction technologies, preparation o f land and&#13;
infrastructure layouts, etc. will also be provided under the Project.&#13;
&#13;
19.     The GO1 will share part o f the costs o f land acquisition and repair/reconstruction o f&#13;
houses by grant funding. According to the available information, Tamil Nadu will receive a sum&#13;
o f Rs. 650 crores (US$148.4 million) [Rs. 50 crores (US$11.4 million) for land and Rs. 600&#13;
crores (US$137.0 million) for housing] and Pondicherry will receive Rs. 50 crores (US$11.4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
million) [Rs. 10 crores (US$2.3 million) for land and Rs. 40 crores (US$9.1 million) for housing]&#13;
and cost o f reconstruction o f the housing.&#13;
&#13;
20.   ' The necessary services and community infrastructure in the resettlement sites would be&#13;
provided either directly by the respective government departments/ agencies or through public-&#13;
private partnerships.&#13;
&#13;
21.     The costs o f housing related services and community infrastructure in the case o f&#13;
resettlements are estimated at Rs 30,000 (US$685) per unit in rural Tamil Nadu. Infrastructure&#13;
would include access roads, internal roads, water supply, latrines, storm drains, electrification&#13;
and rain water harvesting structure as necessary.          Community halls, anganwadi (nursery&#13;
schools), primary schools, and other similar community facilities may also be provided if&#13;
determined to be necessary.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-componentIC:Resettlementof FamiliesAffectedby the Project(US$19.4 million)&#13;
22.     Fundingunder this sub-component will be used for resettlement of families displaced due&#13;
to project activities such as those squatting on the public lands to be used for the construction o f&#13;
houses to the tsunami affected families and by acquisition o f private lands. Resettlement o f&#13;
3,000 families in Chennai who are squatting or encroaching on public lands which have been&#13;
identified for construction o f houses required by tsunami-affected families will be funded.&#13;
Construction o f housing and the associated infrastructure under this sub-component will follow&#13;
the same principles described under sub-component lb.&#13;
&#13;
23.     It i s foreseeable that project activities would result in additional need for resettlement o f&#13;
families who were not affected by the tsunami. However, the number o f such cases i s expected&#13;
to be rather small. A clear picture will emerge when the beneficiary surveys are completed and&#13;
their choices are incorporated insub-project formulation. Inall cases resettlement will be carried&#13;
out in accordance with the principles and guidelines o f ESMF, and Resettlement Plans will be&#13;
prepared based on the findings o f the social screening o f sub-projects.&#13;

                           India: EmergencyTsunamiReconstructionProject&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.        This annex provides a general overview o f the pre-tsunami position and context for&#13;
fisheries in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry, physical and financial assessments o f the impact on&#13;
fisheries; up-to-date information on how the industry and Central and State authorities are&#13;
responding, and; rehabilitation and reconstruction activities to be supported by the Project.&#13;
&#13;
FISHERIESPRE-TSUNAMI&#13;
&#13;
2.       Livelihoods/employment. At the time o f the tsunami, marine fisheries in the affected&#13;
areas provided livelihoods for an estimated "fishing population"* o f 815,000 (Government of&#13;
Tamil Nadu Department of Fisheries Marine Fisherfolk Census, 2000, and Union Territory o f&#13;
Pondicherry Government Statistics), o f which some 242,000 were active fishermen. Inaddition&#13;
to fish-catching, there are a range o f ancillary activities which depend on fishing such as trading,&#13;
transport, ice manufacture and supply, fish processing, boat and gear repair services. In most&#13;
fishing industries, particularly where there is a high artisan component as in South-East India,&#13;
these ancillary services typically employ as much as three times the numbers directly involved in&#13;
fishcatching.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Pvoduction and pvoductive assets. The overall catch from these fisheries has risen from&#13;
an annual level o f less than 100,000 tones inthe early 1950's to a level o f 420,000 tones in2003-&#13;
04. Recent records suggest that production, which has seen more or less continuous expansion&#13;
since the early 19.50'~~has now reached a plateau.&#13;
&#13;
4.        Production has been based on the use o f three broad categories o f fishing craft: wooden&#13;
catamarans o f traditional design; fiber-reinforced plastic vessels, and; larger mechanizedvessels&#13;
capable o f trawling and fishing for periods o f more than one or two days from shore. The&#13;
smaller vessels can be operated from undeveloped and largely un-serviced beach sites where&#13;
coastal fishing villages are located, but they are restricted in terms o f the distance and time they&#13;
can operate away from the shore. The mechanized vessels require basic infrastructure in the&#13;
form o f harbors or jetties.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Increases in numbers o f vessels and in their catching capacity particularly through&#13;
motorization and the development o f a large mechanized fleet have underpinned the major&#13;
increases in production over recent decades.                     Tamil Nadu Department o f Fisheries figures&#13;
indicate that in 2003 there was a total o f 68,000 boats comprising 12,000 mechanized boats,&#13;
23,000 fiber reinforced plastic boats and 33,000 wooden catamarans. The rapid expansion that&#13;
has taken place i s demonstrated by the fact that 11 years earlier, the number o f boats was only&#13;
slightly over half the 2003 total. Total number o f boats in Pondichen-y and Karaikal was 8,000&#13;
o f which approximately 500 were mechanized, 1,350 fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) boats and&#13;
6,150 catamarans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
* "Fishing population" means population of coastal villages where the dominant economic activity is marine fishing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                              23&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6.      Social dimensions and vulnerability.        Socioeconomic studies consistently find the&#13;
majority o f coastal fishing populations to be below the poverty line and to lack access to&#13;
productive agricultural land.      Indicators for coastal fishing communities show lower than&#13;
regional and national average literacy rates, lower status for women, poorer quality housing and&#13;
lower availability o fbasic services such as sanitation and water.&#13;
&#13;
7.      Coastal fishing communities are vulnerable to a large set o f environmental factors,&#13;
including seasonal variations in resource availability, coastal erosion, cyclones and pollution&#13;
effects generated by land-based activities and transported to coastal areas.&#13;
&#13;
8.      Institutional context. Many fishing communities in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry are&#13;
organized along traditional caste lines and the role o f the caste panchayat i s important for&#13;
conflict resolution and for generating community funds, raised through taxes on fish sales.&#13;
Leadership and links with formal political power are normally organized through these&#13;
traditional, village-level structures.     Self-help groups for women in fisheries have been&#13;
established more recently, as have cooperatives, although the latter appear to have been&#13;
relatively ineffective. Boat operations are organized between owner and crew according to a&#13;
share system.&#13;
&#13;
9.      The Government o f Tamil Nadu, through its Department o f Fisheries, Cooperative&#13;
Federation and Development Corporation, parastatals which are managedby the Department, has&#13;
important and influential sector management and regulatory roles. Cooperatives are considered&#13;
to have been o f limited success and largely usedfor the delivery o f Government welfare schemes&#13;
and subsidies.     The Development Corporation performs some technology development and&#13;
transfer functions and implements infrastructure investment schemes.              The Pondicherry&#13;
Government has similar powers and responsibilities inrespect o f fisheries in its territories.&#13;
&#13;
10.     Policy issues. The key policy issue affecting the sector i s how to achieve and maintain a&#13;
sustainable and equitable balance between fleet capacity and fishery resources. The current&#13;
situation i s one where this balance i s clearly under threat. Indications include the rapid fleet&#13;
expansion, declining catch per unit effort, decreasing fish sizes, declining profitability,&#13;
production levels flattening out and increased levels o f conflict between vessels at sea. The&#13;
recent introduction of a closed season in Tamil Nadu and its general acceptance by the industry&#13;
confirms that the perception o fresources being at risk i s widely shared.&#13;
&#13;
11.     Under these circumstances, actions aimed solely at expanding fleet capacity would be&#13;
inappropriate and would exacerbate problems already apparent in the sector, making it even&#13;
more difficult for the fishing community to sustain their livelihoods or generate income and&#13;
employment for others.&#13;
&#13;
12.     To date, policy has been implicitly based on a principle o f encouraging ever-increasing&#13;
levels o f production, supported by the introduction and dissemination o f upgraded technologies.&#13;
Continuation o f such an approach would no longer seem to be sustainable and increased&#13;
management o f the fisheries, including the control o f catching capacity, would n o w appear to be&#13;
inevitable if the fishery i s to continue to make positive contributions to the social and economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
life o f the region. The impact o f the tsunami has forced this issue clearly into focus and there are&#13;
implications for how government should respond.&#13;
&#13;
IMPACT OF THE TSUNAMI&#13;
&#13;
Tamil Nadu&#13;
13.       Boats and gear. Tamil Nadu Department o f Fisheries officials undertook assessments o f&#13;
damage to the productive equipment in the affected districts. These assessments were verified&#13;
and endorsed by the District Collectors for each district. The overall impact on boats and gear&#13;
were assessedas follows:&#13;
&#13;
                                              Fully         Partially        Total&#13;
                                            damaged         damaged&#13;
             Catamarans                     31,383            4,247         35,530&#13;
             FRPboats                         8,140           2,978         11,118&#13;
             Mechanizedboats                  2,655            1,775          4,430&#13;
             Nets (tones)                     2,200                           2,200&#13;
             Engines                                           1,560           1,560&#13;
&#13;
14.       The financial cost o f this damage to boats and gear has been estimated at Rs 907.5 crore&#13;
(US$207.2 million).&#13;
&#13;
 15.      Infrastructure and other sewices. Damage to infrastructure has also been assessed by&#13;
Department officials. This has included damages to harbors, jetties, aquaculture installations, bar&#13;
mouths and estuaries, Department buildings and boats. The Department estimates indicate a&#13;
total financial need o f Rs 310 crore (US$70.8 million) for this category o f damage. It i s&#13;
important to note, however, that a major proportion o f this sum i s accounted for by a number o f&#13;
infrastructure and service development programs rather than programs to restore damage to&#13;
facilities and services incurred by the tsunami. Many o f the proposed initiatives are programs&#13;
which are included inthe FiveYear Plan, which was established well before December 2004.&#13;
&#13;
Pondicherry&#13;
 16.      The tsunami caused damage to 8,025 boats (catamarans and FRP boats) in Pondicherry.&#13;
The estimated cost o f damages to the boats and gear are Rs46.5 crore (US$10.6 million).&#13;
&#13;
 17.      As with Tamil Nadu, the estimates for restoration o f infrastructure and other services&#13;
have been combined with longer term development initiatives, including fishery growth centers,&#13;
new fishing vessels, training. The total identifiedinthis way has been estimated at Rs 57.5 crore&#13;
(US$13.1 million), only Rs 25.0 crore (US$5.7 million) o f which appears to relate to restoration&#13;
of damage incurredby the tsunami.&#13;
&#13;
GOVERNMENT INDUSTRYRESPONSES&#13;
                  AND&#13;
&#13;
 18.      Provision offunds for boats and gear. The Government o f India agreed in early March&#13;
to sanction the provision o f funds by State authorities to cover the costs o f replacement o f boats,&#13;
 engines and fishing gear. Rates o f grant assistance have been set for the range o f categories o f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
damage as: fully damaged catamarans 100%; fully damaged FRP boats 50%; fully damaged&#13;
mechanizedboats 35%; partly damaged catamarans 100% (max Rs 10,000); partly damaged FW&#13;
boats (max Rs 15,000); partly damaged mechanized boats 60% o f assessed damage; supply o f&#13;
nets 100%.&#13;
&#13;
19.     Government confirmation o f funding for replacement o f boats and gear has effectively&#13;
precluded the achievement o f fleet restructuring objectives through the use o f post-disaster&#13;
financial support, a strategy which had beenmooted at an earlier stage.&#13;
&#13;
20.    Emerging response of industry. The perceived risk identified with the provision o f&#13;
subsidy for restoration o f the fleet was that it would result in the establishment o f increased&#13;
capacity and an exacerbation o f the core fisheries management problems that affected the&#13;
industrypre-tsunami. At the time o f the mission, the implementationo f the Government scheme&#13;
was only beginning and its eventual effect was unclear. While there i s a possibility that there&#13;
will be some increase incapacity at the level o f the small-scale vessels, this was unlikely to take&#13;
place in the mechanized fleet, where fundamental economic conditions in the fishery mean that&#13;
owners are likely to use the restoration assistance for alternative activities rather than for new&#13;
fishingcapacity.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT    STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
21.     Strategic considerations. The central dilemma posed post-tsunami i s to re-establish the&#13;
livelihoods o f poor coastal people while at the same time avoiding building up future problems&#13;
by increasing pressure on the resources. A careful balance is needed between responding to the&#13;
real short-term pressures and resolving the more basic long-term problem o f h o w to manage the&#13;
fisheries in a sustainable manner.&#13;
&#13;
22.     IDA support to GO1post-tsunamiemergency reconstruction should therefore avoid direct&#13;
encouragement o f fishing capacity levels above those in existence pre-tsunami and should avoid&#13;
indirect encouragement o f increased capacity through the provision o f new infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
23.     At this juncture and for the purposes o f emergency reconstruction, Bank support should&#13;
be focused primarily on the restorationo f services to pre-tsunami levels.&#13;
&#13;
24.     In addition, the emergency has generated an increased level of public focus on the&#13;
problems o f fisheries. It thus provides an opportunity to the government to address key policy&#13;
issues affecting it. Technical assistance implemented through policy research and analyses and&#13;
special studies, to review sector policy, and address the core issues facing the future o f the&#13;
sector, drawing on and adapting the principles and norms for the achievement o f sustainable and&#13;
equitable fisheries, as developed in the International Code o f Conduct for Responsible Fisheries&#13;
would be supported with grant funding. It would address issues already identified within the&#13;
Tamil Nadu Five Year Plan, namely improved management o f marine fisheries including&#13;
through increased participation o f fishing communities. It would also identify how to improve&#13;
the integration o f fisheries with other sectors, in particular through links with integrated coastal&#13;
area management policies and approaches.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25.     As well as policy reform, longer term sustainability will depend critically on fishing&#13;
communities being able to access alternative forms o f livelihood.         Currently, because o f&#13;
relatively low and highly specialized skill and educational levels, fishers have difficulty in&#13;
accessing opportunities in other sectors o f the economy. This i s a long-term issue which has&#13;
been highlighted by the current emergency. Government can lay the foundations for long-term&#13;
recovery on a sustainable basis by enhancing skill and educational levels in fishingcommunities.&#13;
&#13;
26.     Considering the above, the following programs have been identified by the Governments&#13;
o f Tamil Nadu and the Union Territory o f Pondicherry. While the restoration o f services are to&#13;
be financed out o f the proposed Project, the technical assistance and training are proposed to be&#13;
financed out o f the grant funding for which a separate agreement will be prepared.&#13;
&#13;
Restoration of Services&#13;
27.     Tamil Nadu (Estimated March 2005 base cost: Rs 65.0 crores / US$14.8 million):&#13;
        (i)  restoration o f damage to four fishing harbors at Chinnamuttam, Nagapattinam,&#13;
             Mallippatinam and Pazhayar, at an estimated cost o f Rs 31.9 crore (US$7.3&#13;
             million);&#13;
        (ii)replacement ofdamagedtwo Patrolboats at anestimated cost ofRs2.0 crore&#13;

             crore (US$2.3 million); and&#13;
        (v) re-establishment o f safety-at-sea systems/services at an estimated cost o f Rs 5.5&#13;
             crore (US$1.3 million).&#13;
&#13;

25 crores (US$5.7 million).&#13;
&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
29.     Policy support - TA for development o f fisheries policy at an estimated cost o f Rs 4.4&#13;
crore (US$1.O million).&#13;

&#13;
RATIONALE OF THE STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
1.      International experience o f post-disaster reconstructionhas shown that no amount&#13;
o f policy initiatives, financial assistance, and technical know-how will be effective&#13;
without a systemto convey content swiftly, clearly and widely to the affected public, and&#13;
to hear and assess their suitability and sustainability within communities.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The government has a leading role to play in collating community requirements,&#13;
transferring funds and material to the affected areas, sharing knowledge and lessons&#13;
leamt, setting technical and other parameters, enumerating and sharing location, housing,&#13;
financial and livelihood options, facilitating civil society interventions, ensuring justice&#13;
and protection for the vulnerable, preventing leakages, and providing political and&#13;
administrative support to the reconstructionprocess.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Government cannot perform any o f these roles without effective communication&#13;
between relevant departments, the public and other partners, and without systems for&#13;
consultation, transparency and redressing grievances.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Recognizing this, the governments o f Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry have set up&#13;
mechanisms to facilitate communication, transparency, and grievance redress. These will&#13;
be strengthenedand made more systematic in order to play a strategic and enhanced role&#13;
through the duration o f the reconstruction program.&#13;
&#13;
5.      A key feature o f this exercise is that it will build as far as possible on existing&#13;
community organizations and embedded communication systems, and will involve local&#13;
civil society and non-government organizations with networks and relationships among&#13;
the communities.&#13;
&#13;
6.      The broadpurposes to be served by this set o f activities are:&#13;
        0  Dissemination o f information&#13;
        0  Facilitating community consultation and participation&#13;
        0  Buildinglocal technical capacity&#13;
        0   Coordination among partners&#13;
        0  Transparency to ensure accountability&#13;
        0  Redressinggrievances&#13;
        0  Addressingexternal stakeholders and audiences&#13;
&#13;
7.      Dissemination of      information:     This is     the most basic and essential&#13;
communication requirement. Inorder to serve the principles o fjustice and transparency,&#13;
to share technical knowledge, to retain public morale and faith, and to ensure informed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              33&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  participation, it i s necessary that every single affected family be made aware o f&#13;
  government policies and compensation packages, housing and livelihood options,&#13;
  individual entitlements and rights, eligibility criteria, construction techniques, and&#13;
  grievance redress procedures among other things.&#13;
&#13;
  8.      Information dissemination i s a continuous process, beginning immediately and&#13;
  running throughout the recovery and reconstruction period.           A variety o f media,&#13;
  materials, and methods will need to be employed to bothpro-actively convey information&#13;
  to the affected public, and to make it accessible to those who come seeking it.&#13;
&#13;
  9.      Community consultation and participation: In order to facilitate participatory&#13;
  and consultative processes, a two-way communication mechanism needs to be in place.&#13;
  It must convey information from the government to individuals, and also be able to&#13;
  collect and channel community views back to policy-makers. Most important, it must&#13;
  give voice to poor, vulnerable, and marginalized sections.&#13;
&#13;
  10.     This implies both a ground-level communications network, and a mechanism to&#13;
  integrate ground feedback into policy.&#13;
&#13;
  11.    Building local technical capacity: A big challenge o f the recovery program i s to&#13;
  rebuild thousands o f individual houses to affordable but sound engineering standards.&#13;
  This implies educating, in a very short time and over an elongated geographical area, a&#13;
  large number o f house-owners, laborers, builders and architects, and assessors. The&#13;
  communication challenge includes the very basic one o f demystifying concepts like&#13;
  `hazard resistance', and goes on to the more substantial tasks o f publicizing technical&#13;
  standards and explaining buildingtechniques.&#13;
&#13;
  12.     The communication strategy must serve these needs at a number o f levels:&#13;
  provide teaching tools and aids to trainers, calibrated for different audiences; function as&#13;
  an information exchange to enable skilled manpower to be judiciously rotated; and,&#13;
  become a force multiplierthrough strategic use o f mass media and other methods to reach&#13;
  messages to remote and semi or illiterate populations.&#13;
&#13;
  13.     Coordination with partners: Communication between the government and the&#13;
  numerous aid agencies, commercial organizations, NGOs, and community organizations&#13;
' which have come forward to partner it in the recovery program, i s o f paramount&#13;
  importance. Not only must their physical activities be coordinated, but it i s imperative&#13;
  that they all follow common technical standards, apply uniform policies, and do not&#13;
  undermine the drive and initiative o f local communities.&#13;
&#13;
  14.     External partners need to take care not to alienate the local leadership, to ensure&#13;
  participation by poor, vulnerable and marginalized sections, and to be mindful o f the&#13;
  community's dignity.        Only a continuous communication interface among the&#13;
  community, the external partner, and the government will ensure this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               34&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15.      Transparency: A critical element o f the recovery program i s transparency to&#13;
ensure accountability o f spending, accurate targeting o f beneficiaries, build credibility for&#13;
the reconstruction program, and retain public faith.&#13;
&#13;
16.      A transparency strategy would enable communities to certify that beneficiaries&#13;
have been correctly identified, monitor the progress o f work, oversee the inflow and&#13;
disbursal o f funds and materials, and understand the rationale and process o f policies and&#13;
decisions.&#13;
&#13;
17.      Grievance redress: While grievances and complaints are inevitable in a program&#13;
o f this scale, complexity and scope, what i s important i s the presence o f an independent&#13;
and accessible system that can speedily resolve them. This system must be credible and&#13;
acceptable to both the public and government if it i s to be effective.&#13;
&#13;
18.      External audiences: It i s important that the government continually engage with&#13;
secondary stakeholders and extemal audiences, such as the public elsewhere in the state,&#13;
the media, opinion leaders in the state, the intemational community etc. Messages need&#13;
to be consistent and clear in order to portray a correct picture o f the situation on the&#13;
ground, boost public morale, and generate continuous goodwill and support.&#13;
&#13;
19.      A pro-active external communication policy would entail a clearly identified,&#13;
authoritative spokesperson for the recovery program alongside strategic engagement with&#13;
the media, regular interaction with civil society, and communicating through the web.&#13;

APPROACH THE GOVERNMENTSTAMILNADU PONDICHERRY&#13;
              OF                       OF               AND&#13;
&#13;
Tamil Nadu&#13;
20.      A few weeks into the tsunami relief phase, the Government o f Tamil Nadu, in&#13;
consultation with local and intemational NGOs who had rushed to the state, set up&#13;
village-level "tsunami relief committees" in every affected village to help coordinate&#13;
assistance, identify affected families, and provide feedback to NGO partners and the&#13;
administration.&#13;
&#13;
21.      These committees were headed by the president o f the local panchayat (village-&#13;
level elected government), and included three office bearers o f the local fishermen's&#13;
association, a representative each o f women, Scheduled Castes and other marginal&#13;
communities, two NGO representatives, and village administrative and revenue officials.&#13;
&#13;
22.      At the district level, a committee headed by the district collector and includingthe&#13;
local federal and state legislators, elected presidents o f the district and sub-district local&#13;
governments, and relevant district officials was created. An NGO coordination cell,&#13;
manned by NGOs, was established in the district collectorates enabling interaction&#13;
between NGOs and the administration on a daily basis. Periodic apex-level meetings&#13;
with NGOs were held in the state capital, Chennai, at the state relief commissioner's&#13;
office.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              35&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23.      The state also has an ongoing system whereby every Monday i s observed as&#13;
"grievance redress day" in the district collectors' offices. In addition, the collector visits&#13;
one village every month where grievances o f various sorts are addressed; these&#13;
grievances and petitions are invited one month inadvance.&#13;
&#13;
24.      Building on these existing structures and traditions, the state government has&#13;
adopted the following approach to communication and grievance redress for the tsunami&#13;
reconstructionprogram:&#13;
&#13;
25.      The village and district-level tsunami relief committees will be converted into&#13;
information and consultation committees, with the same composition as before, and will&#13;
be used to channel information and receive feedback. As much o f the information flow&#13;
will be o f a technical and intricate nature, local NGOs will be identified to act as&#13;
"information facilitators" for groups o f villages.&#13;
&#13;
26.      At the state level, a Joint Commissioner (Communications) will be appointed in&#13;
the Project Management Unit to develop and implement the communication strategy.&#13;
This officer will oversee the development o f communication tools and ensure information&#13;
flow to communities through the channels described above, monitor and evaluate their&#13;
effectiveness, develop culturally appropriate consultative programs and transparency&#13;
tools, and maintain and supervise relations with external stakeholders such as the media,&#13;
civil society and general public.&#13;
&#13;
27.      This officer will also monitor the functioning o f the grievance redress system,&#13;
including undertaking periodic analysis o f the nature o f complaints in order to identify&#13;
systemic or policy issues.&#13;
&#13;
28.      To redress grievances, the Village Monitoring Committees will function as the&#13;
first tier to resolve disputes, address conflicts that may arise out o f information gaps, and&#13;
advise individuals about the next tier o f the redress system. This next tier will operate at&#13;
the sub-district level and will comprise the additional collector and three to four non-&#13;
government members representing communities and NGOs. In case o f further dispute,&#13;
the state's regular redress system involving the district collector, and if at all necessary,&#13;
the judicial systemwill be utilized.&#13;
&#13;
Pondicherry&#13;
29.      The Pondicherry administration has devised a comprehensive strategy to ensure&#13;
participation and transparency in decision-making.&#13;
&#13;
30.      The territory already possesses village committees comprising leaders o f the&#13;
various social groups in each village and village officials, besides an active movement o f&#13;
women's self-help groups. Fishermen are also organizedwith their own "panchayats".&#13;
&#13;
3 1.     The existing committees and community organizations will be the primary point&#13;
o f contact and will function as the information nodes for the communities, and feedback&#13;
mechanisms for the administration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32.     To ensure transparency, lists o f beneficiaries and the sanctioned assistance will be&#13;
will be furnished to the Village Monitoring Committees, while all government&#13;
resolutions, policies and other relevant documentation will be available on the&#13;
government website.&#13;
&#13;
33.     To redress grievances, the Village Monitoring Committee will operate as the first&#13;
tier.   A regional committee comprising the collector and eminent members o f civil&#13;
society will operate as the second tier.&#13;
&#13;
34.     The    proposed Project     implementing      entity  will include     a  full time&#13;
communications officer who will develop the specific strategies for each o f these&#13;
activities, supervise their implementation, and monitor and evaluate their effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
CONCLUSIONS&#13;
&#13;
35.     The above strategies and arrangements will be fleshed out in detail with the client&#13;
immediately as the operation starts. However, it i s essential that the officer-in-charge o f&#13;
communications i s well qualified to oversee communication with communities, besides&#13;
usual media public relations, and i s posted/ hired immediately.&#13;

model document), in accordance with the Bank Guidelines. Bids would be invited on a "slice&#13;
and package" basis as applicable. Post-qualification would be adopted for all NCB contracts&#13;
with the minimumqualifying criteria fixed for each slice and group o f slices.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Where required, other agreed methods as per Procurement Guidelines, such as Shopping,&#13;
Direct Contracting, in accordance with paragraphs 3.5, 3.6 and reclamation o f land through the&#13;
beneficiary involvement/Community Participation in accordance with paragraph 3.17 o f&#13;

Procurement Guidelines, will be used as a method o f last resort (specifically it may be applicable&#13;
for land desalination treatment by the Department o f Agriculture) and for mangroves/ green belt&#13;
plantation works by the Department of Environment and Forestry.&#13;
&#13;
5.     Housing reconstruction, repair and rehabilitation in-situ in rural areas including&#13;
construction o f transit shelters, where needed, and construction in new locations will be carried&#13;
out through beneficiary.       Reconstruction in new locations would be undertaken by the&#13;
beneficiary through efforts o f Self Help Group (SHG)/Community Participation.                 The&#13;
beneficiaries/SHG, as the case may be, will be required to sign an agreement/MOU with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                38&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
government, in a format acceptable to the Bank for repairs/ reconstruction o f the house and will&#13;
receivepayments on the basis o f progress achieved in stages.&#13;
&#13;
6.     Detailed procedures, acceptable to the Bank, for the implementation o f repairs/&#13;
reconstruction through beneficiaries/ SHGs, including payment procedure to the beneficiaries&#13;
shall be prepared as a Manual (Project Implementation Plan for Tamil Nadu and Operations&#13;
Manual for Pondicherry). A beneficiary can arrange to repair/reconstruct his house himself/&#13;
through his o w n contractor/ NGOs or may also request in writing to get the repairs/&#13;
reconstruction done through Government agencies on his behalf. However, the Manual shall&#13;
encompass all the details as requiredto provide for all alternatives.&#13;
&#13;
7.     When such repair/reconstruction i s required to be carried out through the Government, at&#13;
the preference o f the beneficiary, the Government will use NCB and Shopping procedures as&#13;
described inthe procurement Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
Procurementof Goods (US6.0 million)&#13;
8.     Goods to be procured under this Project would include patrol boats, communication&#13;
equipment, gypsum, seeds, plants, enriched straw block making machines, equipment for the&#13;
dispensaries and veterinary institutes, the required basic office equipment and furniture for the&#13;
implementation agencies for implementation support, etc. Procurement will be in accordance&#13;
with Procurement Guidelines following ICB method for procurement o f materials over&#13;
US$200,000 equivalent and NCB method o f selection for values below this. Shopping will be&#13;
permissible method o f procurement for o f f the shelf goods valued less than US$30,000&#13;
equivalent and Direct Contracting for procurement o f items o f procurement qualified under&#13;
paragraph 3.6 o f Procurement Guidelines and other small value goods not exceeding US$2,000&#13;
equivalent each contract. Procurement o f gypsum for the first year requirements (approximately&#13;
17,000 MT - approximately US$550,000 equivalent) for land reclamatioddesalination treatment&#13;
may also be done on the basis o f Direct Contracting. However, requirement for the subsequent&#13;
years shall be met through acceptable competitive process.&#13;
&#13;
9.     The procurement will be done using Bank's SBD for all ICB procurement and National&#13;
SBDs as agreed with (or satisfactory to) the Bank for other methods.&#13;
&#13;
Selectionof Consultants(US$14.3 million)&#13;
10.    Most o f the consultancy services are required to be hired immediately for rehabilitation&#13;
and reconstruction. Hence there may be need to recruit several such requirements either on sole&#13;
source or on selection based o n qualifications, in accordance with paragraphs 3.7 and 3.10 o f&#13;
Consultant Guidelines, read with footnotes 32 and 33. Incertain cases, it would be on least cost&#13;

&#13;
ASSESSMENT THE AGENCY'S CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENTPROCUREMENT&#13;
               OF&#13;
&#13;
12.     Procurement activities will be carried out by the implementing institutions such as the&#13;
Project Management Unit, TNSCB, Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board&#13;
(CMWSSB), Public Works Department and Departments o f Environment &amp; Forests, Fisheries,&#13;
Rural Development, Agriculture, Horticulture and Animal Husbandry, Tamil Nadu Electricity&#13;
Board (TNEB), District RuralDevelopment agency (DRDA) inTamil Nadu. InPondicherry, the&#13;
Project Implementation Agency (PIA), (to be created and registered under Societies Registration&#13;
Act), will be responsible for procurement with the functional assistance o f the line departments&#13;
concerned.&#13;
&#13;
13.     Of the above named line departmentdagencies in Tamil Nadu, CMWSSB has executed&#13;
recently a Bank financed project and are therefore fully conversant with Bank's procurement&#13;
guidelines and procedures. The other departmentdagencies require training. As such there i s&#13;
higher perceived procurement risk. While in the immediate term the situation will be addressed&#13;
through training and workshops organized for the staff to be engaged in procurement, the&#13;
continued interactions and hands on experience o f the staff during implementation phase o f the&#13;
Project i s expected to establish better understanding. This will be reviewed during the project&#13;
supervision missions on regular basis and revised as necessary.&#13;
&#13;
14.     TNSCB i s engaged inprocurement o f houses constructed under various ongoing schemes&#13;
o f the Government. Award recommendations for works over Rs. 3.0 million are approved by the&#13;
Chief Engineer.     GOTN needs to depute its key officers to training institutions offering&#13;
procurement courses; namely, the National Institute o f Financial Management, Faridabad or the&#13;
Administrative Staff College o f India, Hyderabad.         Additionally, the Bank will arrange&#13;
Procurement workshops for the staff o f the line departments engaged in procurement. The first&#13;
such workshop shall be arranged for participation by all, who will carry out project procurement,&#13;
at Chennai on dates convenient for the Government and the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
15.     Section 15 o f the Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998 stipulated that for&#13;
projects funded by International agreements or by International Financial Agencies the&#13;
provisions o f the Act shall not apply where they are inconsistent with the rules o f these&#13;
Agencies. The following NCB provisions shall apply:&#13;
&#13;
i)      Only the model bidding documents for NCB agreed with the GO1Task Force (and as&#13;
amended from time to time), shall be used for bidding.&#13;
&#13;
ii)     Invitations to bid shall be advertised in at least one widely circulated national daily&#13;
newspaper, at least 30 days prior to the deadline for the submission o f the bids.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
iv)     Except with the prior concurrence o f the Bank, there shall be no negotiation o f price with&#13;
the bidders, even with the lowest evaluated bidder.&#13;
&#13;
v)      Extension o f bid validity shall not be allowed without the prior concurrence o f the Bank&#13;

Bank only incases o f Force Majeure and circumstances beyond the control o f Government.&#13;
&#13;
vi)     Re-bidding shall not be carried out without prior concurrence o f the Bank. The system o f&#13;
rejecting bids outside a predetermined margin or 'bracket' o f prices shall not be used in the&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
vii)   Rate contracts entered into by DGS&amp;D, will not be acceptable as a substitute for NCB&#13;
procedures. Such contracts will be acceptable, however, for any procurement under National&#13;
Shopping procedures.&#13;
&#13;
viii)   Two or three envelope system will not be used.&#13;
&#13;
PROCUREMENT      PLAN&#13;
&#13;
16.     The Governments o f Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry were advised at appraisal to develop&#13;
Procurement Plans for project implementation which will provide the basis for the procurement&#13;
methods.    Detailed Procurement Plan for all identified packages under the Project for each&#13;
section separately will be developed and provided to the Project Team within 30 days from&#13;
Credit effectiveness date. This Procurement Plan, after finalization, will be made available inthe&#13;
project's database and in the Bank's external website. Procurement Plan will be updated in&#13;
agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project&#13;
implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity.&#13;

&#13;
1.       In Tamil Nadu the implementation arrangements are designed around the existing&#13;
government systems o f funds-flow, accounting, reporting and audit. InPondicherry, a Society (a&#13;
separate legal entity) with its own bank account, accounting, reporting and auditing arrangements&#13;
i s being established for implementation of the Project. Implementation arrangements in both&#13;
states will incorporate transparent and robust fiduciary arrangements to ensure accountability and&#13;
will be adequate to account andreport for project resources and expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Since the Project i s being implemented by a separate legal entity in Pondicherry, an&#13;
Operations Manual (OM) will be prepared by the Government o f Pondicherry to document the&#13;
implementation arrangements, including funds-flow arrangements, delegation o f administrative&#13;
and financial powers, key fiduciary controls for each component and reporting and auditing&#13;
arrangements.      However, in Tamil Nadu, since the mainstream government systems and&#13;
processes will be used to implement the Project, a separate operations manual will not be&#13;
required and the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) will document the financial management&#13;
arrangements for implementation o f the various project components.&#13;
&#13;
FUNDSFLOW&#13;
&#13;
3.       The IDA financing will be routed through GO1to the governments o f Tamil Nadu and&#13;
Pondicherry. The GO1plans to modify the existing on lending terms (70% loan and 30% grant)&#13;
to states to an arrangement where the terms to the states would effectively be the same as IDA.&#13;
However, the terms and the implementation arrangements have not yet been finalized.&#13;

&#13;
4.       InTamil Nadu, funds receivedby the State Finance Department will be allocated to the&#13;
various spendingunits through the budget usingthe treasury mechanism. A Project Management&#13;
Unit (PMU) will be formed in the Office o f the Relief Commissioner o f Tamil Nadu for&#13;
providing administrative support and coordinating all project activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   43&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.       In Pondicherry, all components will be implemented by the PIA, a Society registered&#13;
under the Societies Registration Act. The PIA will be the sole spending unit and will handle the&#13;
financial arrangements for the Project. Funds will be passed on to the PIA as grant-in aid The&#13;
PIA will operate its own Bank Account and all payments for the Project will be made from this&#13;
account.&#13;
&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION        ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
Housing Reconstruction (US$596.8 million)&#13;
&#13;
Tamil Nadu&#13;
&#13;
6.      Rural Housing and Urban Housing, Except in Chennai and Tiruvallur. Housing will be&#13;
mainly constructed by the beneficiaries through self help groups, with exceptions wherever&#13;
necessary. If the beneficiary so wishes, the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) will&#13;
construct the house through contractors. Incases o f an NGO taking up reconstruction o f houses&#13;
with its own finance, such settlements will be separated from the IDA aided Reconstruction&#13;
Project for control purposes.&#13;
&#13;
7.       InTamil Nadu funds will be transferred to the District Collector/DRDA under budgetary&#13;
support. Once the block-wise administrative sanction for the reconstruction o f the house i s given&#13;
by the District Collector under the aegis o f the Government Order issued for this purpose, an&#13;
MOUina standard format provided inthe PIP, will be signed betweenthe SHGs and the District&#13;
Collector or his designate, and funds will be transferred from the DRDA account to the bank&#13;
account o f the SHG'.     An initial advance at a fixed percentage can be drawn by the SHG to start&#13;
construction.     Consequent installments at predetermined percentages will be released on&#13;
certification o f completion o f standard milestones by a technical committee comprising Project&#13;
Engineers and SHG representatives. For those houses that require repairs, the beneficiaries will&#13;
directly enter into MOUs with District Collectorihis designate, and would receive installments at&#13;
predeterminedpercentages on the basis o f certified milestones.&#13;
&#13;
8.       InTamil Nadu, the DRDAs are already constructingrural houses under the IndiraAwas&#13;
Yojana (rural housing program for people at below poverty line) and the Prime Minister's&#13;
Gramin Sadak Yojana (Rural Roads Program) and have adequate fiduciary controls in place.&#13;
The DRDAs have a comprehensive computerized management information system - Rural&#13;
Action Plan IntegratedDatabase (WID), which facilitates effective monitoring o f physical and&#13;
financial progress o f the housing schemes.&#13;
&#13;
Pondicherry&#13;
&#13;
9.       In Pondicherry this component will be implemented by the PIA. The construction/&#13;
reconstruction o f houses will be done either directly by the beneficiaries or through the&#13;
machinery o f PIA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  SHGs will open separate bank account for the purpose ofreconstruction of houses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       44&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10.      Construction o f infrastructure at relocation sites in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry will be&#13;
implementedby Collector/DRDA and PIA respectively through contractors.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Urban Housing in Chennai and Tiruvallur. Implementation will be carried out by&#13;
TNSCB through competitive bidding. TNSCB will receive funds as grant-in aid under budgetary&#13;
support.   Standard structures with related infrastructure will be constructed for each family.&#13;
TNSCB i s already implementing a State sponsored Slum Clearance Program, under which they&#13;
have constructed similar structures. Therefore, inorder to ensure that funds under the Project are&#13;
identified separately, the TNSCB will open a separate Bank Account. The TNSCB has adequate&#13;
fiduciary arrangements to handle operation o f this size. TNSCB will pass on funds as advances&#13;
to the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board and the Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board for&#13;
doing certain infrastructure related work and account for such expenditure in its books on the&#13;
basis o f monthly expenditure statements received from the two agencies. Release o f funds to&#13;
these agencies will be output based.&#13;
&#13;
12.      For new housing, GO1has set a maximum threshold o f Rs 120,000 per house, at Rs 400&#13;
per sq. ft. for a plinth area of 300 sq. ft. per unit. GOU IDA funding will be restricted to such&#13;
ceilings. The upper ceiling for a house having a floor area less than 300 sq. ft. will be reduced&#13;
proportionately based on standard cost per sq. ft. The Bank Team estimated that on an average,&#13;
Rs. 50,000 will be required per housing unit for the civic amenities and community&#13;
infrastructure. Infrastructure plans o f each new settlement will be cleared with the Bank, where&#13;
it exceeds Rs.50,000 per housing unit.&#13;
&#13;
13.      Appropriate controls/records will have to be maintained by the implementing agencies to&#13;
ensure that the thresholds per unit are not exceeded for the purpose o f claiming reimbursement&#13;
from the Bank. Excess expenditure, if any, incurred on reconstruction o f houses will be financed&#13;
by the beneficiary/Government concerned.&#13;
&#13;
Restorationof livelihood(US$36,4million)&#13;
14.      Assistance will be provided to fisheries (only infrastructure related work), agriculture,&#13;
horticulture and animal husbandry.        Assistance in fisheries and agriculture sector will be&#13;
provided in both Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry whereas assistance in horticulture and animal&#13;
husbandry will be provided in Tamil Nadu only. There are no cash grants under this component&#13;
and all activities will support productive assets. InTamil Nadu each o f the sub-components will&#13;
be implemented by the respective line departments.              The Fisheries and agriculture sub-&#13;
component in Pondicherry will be implemented by the PIA. Under this component, wherever&#13;
monies are flowing to the beneficiaries'       bank account, M O U s will be signed between the&#13;
administrative department and the beneficiary.&#13;
&#13;
PublicBuildingsandPublicWorks (US$19.5million)&#13;
15.      Most works under this component will be implemented by the Public Works Department,&#13;
while plantations of mangrove in coastal areas will be implemented by the Department o f&#13;
Environment &amp; Forests.&#13;
&#13;
TechnicalAssistance andTraining(US$11.1million)&#13;
16.      Technical assistance activities will be managed by the relevant departmentdagencies in&#13;
Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  45&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ImplementationSupport (US$19,0million)&#13;
17.       This component covers project management costs and incremental operating costs. It&#13;
also covers costs o f financial and technical audits, other quality assurance arrangements and&#13;
environment and social assessment.&#13;
&#13;
18.       Incremental operating cost comprises expenditures incurred by the participating line&#13;
departments, DRDAs and TNSCB in Tamil Nadu and PIA and participating line departmentsin&#13;
Pondicherry inrespect o f general office expenses, hiring, maintenance and operation o f vehicles,&#13;
office equipment and furniture and salaries and allowances o f staff employed for the purpose o f&#13;
the implementingthe Program".&#13;
&#13;
STAFFING&#13;
&#13;
19.       In Tamil Nadu, a Chief Accounts Officer (CAO) from the Treasury and Accounts&#13;
services has been deputed in P M U in the Office o f the Relief Commissioner. InPondicherry a&#13;
senior officer from the Finance Department will be deputed as the Financial Controller (FC) in&#13;
PIA by the Project's effectiveness. The CAO/FC will have to be assisted by requisite support&#13;
staff.&#13;
&#13;
20.       Since the rural housing component in Tamil Nadu involves large funds and has a&#13;
complex implementation design, the capacity of the DRDAs in handling the financial&#13;
management function, will be strengthened wherever necessary by contracting additional staff&#13;
and providing training. Staffing in TNSCB and the Fisheries Department would also require&#13;
strengthening.&#13;
&#13;
ACCOUNTINGAND FINANCIALREPORTING&#13;
&#13;
21.       In Tamil Nadu, the PMU, and the implementing departments will follow cash based&#13;
government accounting system. The annual budget for the Project will be provided under an&#13;
identifiable budget head under Externally Aided Projects in the Demand for Grants every year&#13;
with subheads indicating allocation for each line department/agency. It will be the responsibility&#13;
of the P M U in the office o f the Relief Commissioner to prepare overall accounts in coordination&#13;
with Accountant General (Accounts &amp; Entitlement), TNSCB and the DRDAs.&#13;
&#13;
22.       In Tamil Nadu, accounts compiled by the Accountant General (Accounts and&#13;
Entitlements) - AG (A&amp;E) will need some modification for the housing component. Under the&#13;
housing component, funds transferred to the DRDAs and TNSCB will be treated as advances for&#13;
the project accounting purposes, unlike the accounts o f the State compiled by the AG, where all&#13;
transfers from consolidated hnd are recorded as expenditures. Monthly expenditures actually&#13;
paid by the DRDAs and TNSCB will be recorded as expenditures in the project accounts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
loProgram means GOI's program o f recovery and reconstruction to mitigate the impact o f tsunami tidal waves that&#13;
hit Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry on December 26, 2004. This Program focuses on support and assistance to&#13;
improve livelihood, micro-enterprises, housing, roads, ports, health, education, environment etc. The proposed IDA&#13;
Project i s a part o f this Program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        46&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Monthly expenditure statements in agreed formats from these two agencies will have to be&#13;
obtained to determine expenditure under the Housing component. TNSCB will prepare monthly&#13;
accounts incorporating the expenditures incurred by TNEB and CMWSSB.                  For the other&#13;
departments, accounts compiled by the AG will suffice.       It will be ensured that there is no&#13;
duplication o f the accounting work between AG (A&amp;E) and the office o f the Relief&#13;
Commissioner.&#13;
&#13;
23.     InPondicherry, the PIA will follow cashbaseddouble entryaccountingsystem.&#13;
&#13;
24.     The PMU/PIA will submit quarterly financial monitoring reports (FMRs), in agreed&#13;
formats as part o f the Quarterly Progress Reports (QPRs), to IDA within 30 days of the end of&#13;
each quarter, starting from the period ending September 30,2005.&#13;
&#13;
INTERNAL    CONTROL&#13;
&#13;
25.     InTamil Nadu the internal control system is governed by the State and Departmental&#13;
Financial Rules. The system relies on compliance with extensive rules for controlling and&#13;
reporting on receipts and expenditureswith traditional treasury control over cash payments and&#13;
issue o f checks, a cash-based single entry accounting and a chart o f accounts that i s substantially&#13;
uniform across central and state governments inIndia. However, the internal audit systeminthe&#13;
State i s inadequate to handle the additional audit requirements under this Project. Therefore,&#13;
internal control framework under the Project i s being enhancedby out-sourcing the internal audit&#13;
hnctionunder agreed Terms o f Reference (TORS).&#13;
&#13;
26.     Inthe case of Pondicherry, the control framework of the PIA will build on the existing&#13;
government financial rules with required enhancements for large and disparate implementation&#13;
arrangements.     This would be clearly laid out in the Operations Manual and implemented&#13;
accordingly.&#13;
&#13;
InternalAudit&#13;
27.     Considering the large size o f the operation with large expenditures to be incurred,&#13;
management oversight will be strengthenedby quarterly internal audit inTamil Nadu. The Bank&#13;
recommends appointment o f a reputed audit firm, acceptable to the Bank under agreed TOR,&#13;
The internal auditor will assess the operations o f the project's financial management system,&#13;
including review o f internal control mechanisms.        It will ensure prompt identification of&#13;
problems, timely corrective actions and systemic recommendations for enhanced accountability&#13;
and transparency.&#13;
&#13;
28.     The size o f the operations in Pondicherry is much smaller.       Therefore, a half yearly&#13;
external audit by a reputed firm o f chartered accountants under agreed TOR will be sufficient.&#13;
&#13;
29.     Issues arising in the external and internal audits will need to be promptly addressed by&#13;
the project authorities.&#13;
&#13;
30,     For the housing component, apart from the financial audit, quality assurance and&#13;
technical audit will also be carried out by third parties.      Physical progress and quality of&#13;
construction will be certified by independent Technical Auditors on a sample check basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 47&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
However, every house will be covered at least twice during the life o f the construction cycle.&#13;
The technical auditors will report directly to PMU/PIA. PMU/PIA will need to ensure&#13;
synchronization between the technical and intemal/extemal auditors through appropriate TORS&#13;
to gain maximum benefit out o f their work. Names o f beneficiaries will be listed in the MOU&#13;
signed with each SHG in Tamil Nadu. Names of beneficiaries will also be put on the Tsunami&#13;
relatedwebsites of Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry and the fact that the names have been put on the&#13;
web will be publicized. The control framework will be further strengthened through social&#13;
assessment and grievance redressal mechanism (see Attachment 4 o f this Technical Annex).&#13;
&#13;
External Audit&#13;
31.        It has been agreed that an annual" extemal audit will be done by the State AG inTamil&#13;
Nadu whereas in Pondicherry, the PIA will appoint a reputed audit firm acceptable to the Bank&#13;
to conduct half-yearly audit. Audit report for Tamil Nadu will be submitted to the Bank within&#13;
six months o f the end of the financial year whereas for Pondicherry it will be submitted within&#13;
three months o f the end of the period under audit.&#13;
&#13;
32.        Agreed TOR for the extemal audit will be provided in the Operations Manual&#13;
(Pondicherry) and PIP (Tamil Nadu). Similar terms o f reference have already been agreed with&#13;
the AG inTamil Nadu for the Tamil Nadu Health Project.&#13;
&#13;
33.        The audit reports that will be monitored on the Audit Report Compliance System are&#13;
provided inthe table below.&#13;

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENTSYSTEM&#13;
&#13;
34.        A Preliminary Financial Accountability Assessment (PFAA) was carried out in Tamil&#13;
Nadu in 2002, which noted that the state has an established system o f budgetary controls,&#13;
expenditure authorization, accounting, auditing and legislative oversight. In terms o f overall&#13;
financial management and quality o f staff, Tamil Nadu compares favorably with most other&#13;
Indian States.&#13;
&#13;
35.        The governments o f Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry have prior experience inhandling IDA-&#13;
financed projects with satisfactory financial management arrangements.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
   36.     In Tamil Nadu, funds will be routed through the state budget which will bring the&#13;
   operations within the purview o f the budgetary controls and enable accurate tracking o f&#13;
   expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
   37.     However, the Project presents a number o f challenges that require mitigation measures&#13;
   (Table A6-3).&#13;
&#13;

   DISBURSEMENT           ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
   39.      The Government o f India will open one Special Account with the Reserve Bank o f India&#13;
   for Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry. An advance o f US$ 50.0 million will be provided to meet the&#13;
   anticipated expenditures for the initial four months. Replenishments would be provided to this&#13;
   Bank account by IDA on the basis o f withdrawal applications evidencing the project related&#13;
   expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
   40.      Disbursements from the Special Account will be made in the traditional system o f&#13;
   reimbursement against monthly claims with full documentation and against SOE claims.&#13;
   Consolidated monthly claims will be submitted by the PMU (Tamil Nadu) and PIA&#13;
   (Pondicherry) to Controller o f Aid, Accounts and Audits for onward submission to the Bank for&#13;

             Attachment7-EnvironmentalandSocial Assessment Framework&#13;
                      India:EmergencyTsunamiReconstructionProject&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.      An Environmental and Social Management Framework (the Framework) has been&#13;
prepared to support the environmental and social assessments o f all rehabilitation and&#13;
reconstruction activities to ensure that adverse environmental and social impacts are minimized&#13;
and appropriate mitigation measures are included in project design.         This Framework was&#13;
discussed with the representatives of Governments o f Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry during the&#13;
Technical Discussions and finalized reflecting the minor revisions and clarifications. Based on&#13;
the experience o f application and implementation of this framework, the provisions and&#13;
procedures will be updated and modified from time to time, as appropriate, to suit to the project&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The principles governing social and environmental management will be applied through&#13;
the Framework and are applicable to all activities financed by the Project, including: (i)     key&#13;
policy principles for social and environmental management; (ii) to screen sub-projects for&#13;
                                                                   tools&#13;
social/environmental impacts and mitigate such impacts; (iii)    procedures to ensure that these&#13;
principles and tools are appropriately applied; and (iv) guidelines for capacity building and&#13;
monitoring.    The Frameworks will be implemented through the existing government line&#13;
agencies and monitored through P M U inTamil Nadu andPIA inPondicherry.&#13;
&#13;
3.      All proposed sub-projects will be screened to ensure that the environmental and social&#13;
risks are adequately addressed through the application o f standardized guidelines and codes o f&#13;
practice or through sub-project-specific management and mitigation plans consistent with&#13;
Government and Bank guidelines/policies. The emergency nature o f the proposed reconstruction&#13;
operations and the related needto provide immediate assistance i s recognized. At the same time&#13;
the Framework will ensure due diligence inmanagingpotential environmental and social risks.&#13;
&#13;
4.      The Project will have two types o f social impacts. The primary social impacts are related&#13;
to 1'sunami impacts, while secondary social impacts are associated with the project activities.&#13;
The social impacts associated with Tsunami reconstruction are mostly related to alternative&#13;
permanenthransit housing and associated facilities, livelihood restoration support and insecurity&#13;
issues.   These impacts will be addressed by the provisions o f Tsunami Housing Policy o f&#13;
Governments o f Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry. This policy spells out the nature o f assistance and&#13;
support for different categories o f tsunami impacts.&#13;
&#13;
5.      For those affected by the tsunami, the project's main concern i s to house those without&#13;
permanent shelter as quickly as possible with an adequate standard o f housing. Social risks to be&#13;
managed include mainly the feasibility and acceptability o f the sites, the efficiency and equity o f&#13;
the implementation mechanisms, maintaining good relations between host populations and&#13;
newcomers at relocation sites and preventing elite capture and free riders. These issues will be&#13;
addressed through sub-project or district social assessments which can identify the stakeholder&#13;
interests and documents the process and results o f the consultation. The objective o f the social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                52&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
assessments i s to support the consultation and participation o f the beneficiaries and ensure&#13;
transparency and accountability inthe deliveryo f the benefit packages.&#13;
&#13;
6.      The reconstruction work associated with Tsunami will also have secondary social&#13;
impacts due to the requirement o f a large amount o f land for housing and other associated&#13;
infrastructure facilities. Incase o f urban areas, particularly in Chennai, the issue o f squatting and&#13;
encroachments on public lands to be used for housing need to be managed carefully.&#13;
Resettlement Plans (RPs)      will be required for all activities that entail involuntary land&#13;
acquisition/ assets or secondary displacement o f people. The process o f preparation o f sub-&#13;
project specific R p s will be guided by the "Guidelines for preparation o f land acquisition and&#13;
involuntary resettlement plans' entitlements and compensation" included inthe framework.&#13;
&#13;
7.      The complete version o f the Framework outlining the principles, objectives and&#13;
procedures together with appropriate annexures containing the screening formats, synopsis o f&#13;
environmental laws and regulations as well as the selected World Bank's safeguard policies,&#13;
guidelines for preparation of mitigation/ management plans, monitoring formats etc is available&#13;
as a stand alone document.&#13;
