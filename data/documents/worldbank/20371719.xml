Putting Evidence to Work: Linking Policy and Practice&#13;
in Capacity Development&#13;
By Thomas Theisohn, Mark Nelson, and Janet Awimbo&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   One of the major challenges facing the international development community is creating a capacity&#13;
   development (CD) architecture built on solid evidence. In this CD Brief, the authors argue that, although&#13;
   a significant body of evidence on CD is being produced, the knowledge is poorly captured and managed.&#13;
   As a result, CD practice and policies fail to take full advantage of lessons and experiences that could&#13;
   lead to better results. Addressing these challenges is the basis of the three-year strategy of the Learning&#13;
   Network on Capacity Development (LenCD), a broad partnership of practitioners and donors dedicated&#13;
   to improving the outcomes of capacity development initiatives. The strategy has three key pillars:&#13;
   evidence, practice, and policy. The aim is to create a more professionalized CD practice and transfer CD&#13;
   learning into the mainstream of development.&#13;

            Putting evidence to work : linking policy
            and practice in capacity development
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            One of the major challenges facing the
            international development community is creating a capacity
            development (CD) architecture built on solid evidence. In
            this CD brief, the authors argue that, although a
            significant body of evidence on CD is being produced, the
            knowledge is poorly captured and managed. As a result, CD
            practice and policies fail to take full advantage of lessons
            and experiences that can lead to better results. Addressing
            these challenges is the basis of the three-year strategy of
            the learning network on CD (LenCD), a broad partnership of
            practitioners and donors dedicated to improving the outcomes
            of CD initiatives. The strategy has three key pillars:
            evidence, practice, and policy. The aim is to create a more
            professionalized CD practice and transfer CD learning into
            the mainstream of development.
