The MDF-JRF Working Paper Series: Lessons Learned from Post-Disaster Reconstruction in&#13;
Indonesia was prepared by the Secretariat of the Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF) and the&#13;
Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF). The World Bank serves as trustee of both funds. The series, consisting&#13;
of five working papers, was produced under the guidance of Shamima Khan, MDF and JRF&#13;
Manager. Anita Kendrick, Monitoring and Evaluation Officer of the MDF and JRF, developed the&#13;
concepts and managed the production of the Working Paper Series and the Knowledge Notes&#13;
based on each paper.&#13;
&#13;
This paper, Working Paper 2 in the series, is entitled Building Capacity: Experiences from Post-&#13;
Disaster Aceh and Nias. The paper is based on research and background text written by Gabriele&#13;
Ferrazzi, World Bank consultant. Shamima Khan, provided general guidance, support and oversight&#13;
of the entire writing and production process. Lina Lo, MDF-JRF Quality Assurance Officer, managed&#13;
the preparation and review of the paper. Anita Kendrick guided the paper preparation, and&#13;
provided editorial oversight and guidance to the production and content. Bernhard May, Public&#13;
Sector Specialist, and Vivek Srivastava, Senior Public Sector Specialist, provided extensive and&#13;
useful comments on the text as peer reviewers. Sharon Lumbantobing managed the production&#13;
process, and Kate Redmond and Devi Asmarani provided editorial support.&#13;
&#13;
Other members of the MDF/JRF Secretariat team and consultants provided significant inputs to&#13;
the working paper on content, design, layout, and production as well as logistical support for&#13;
the review team: Safriza Sofyan, Deputy Manager of the MDF, along with Akil Abduljalil, Deslly&#13;
Sorongan, Inge Susilo, Eva Muchtar, Inayat Bhagawati, Nur Raihan, Nia Sarinastiti, Olga Lambey,&#13;
Amenah Smith, Friesca Erwan, Harry Masyarafah, and David Lawrence. Ola Santo and her team&#13;
from Studio Rancang Imaji prepared the design and layout of the Working Paper Series and&#13;
accompanying Knowledge Notes.&#13;
&#13;
The MDF Secretariat would like to thank the many partners and stakeholders who cooperated with&#13;
the review team during the fieldwork and research period. These included representatives of the&#13;
Government of Indonesia, including line ministries, as well as local governments of Aceh, North&#13;

&amp;#12;THE MDF-JRF WORKING PAPER SERIES&#13;
&#13;
The Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF) and the Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF) are widely&#13;
recognized as having played a significant role in the remarkable recovery of Aceh, Nias and Java,&#13;
following some of the worst disasters in Indonesia over the last decade.&#13;
&#13;
The MDF and the JRF, which is patterned after it, are each considered a highly successful model&#13;
for post-disaster reconstruction. Key factors in this success have been the leadership provided by&#13;
the Government of Indonesia and the strong partnership of multiple stakeholders in support of&#13;
the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s reconstruction agenda. The two programs have produced impressive results,&#13;
both in terms of physical reconstruction, and in the less tangible but equally important benefits&#13;
such as community empowerment, strengthened governance, and communities that are more&#13;
resilient to future disasters. The experiences of the MDF and JRF have generated many useful&#13;
lessons and created effective models and approaches that can be adapted and replicated in other&#13;
reconstruction contexts.&#13;
&#13;
The Secretariat of the MDF and JRF, as part of its culminating activities, has prepared a series&#13;
of working papers to document these achievements and lessons learned. The MDF-JRF Working&#13;
Paper Series: Lessons Learned from Post-Disaster Reconstruction in Indonesia consists of&#13;
five working papers covering five key areas. These are: (1) Community driven approaches for&#13;
post-disaster recovery; (2) Capacity building in a post-disaster context; (3) Reconstruction of&#13;
infrastructure; (4) Promoting gender equality and womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment through post-disaster&#13;
reconstruction; and (5) Multi-donor trust funds as a framework for effective partnerships for&#13;
reconstruction. Each Working Paper describes the strategy and approaches adopted by the MDF&#13;
and/or JRF across its projects, notes the achievements, and draws lessons that will be useful in&#13;
other post-disaster settings. In addition to the full working papers, a series of Knowledge Notes has&#13;
also been prepared, providing a short summary of the key lessons and conclusions from each of&#13;
the longer working papers.&#13;
&#13;
This paper, Working Paper 2 in the series, is entitled Building Capacity: Experiences from Post-&#13;
Disaster Aceh and Nias. It presents the lessons from the MDFâ&#128;&#153;s experience implementing its large&#13;
scale infrastructure reconstruction program in partnership with the Government of Indonesia and&#13;
other partners. This paper discusses the value of a phased approach to post-disaster reconstruction&#13;
as a successful means to manage short-term expectations while delivering long-lasting, results of&#13;
high quality. These MDF experiences offer many lessons for future reconstruction efforts in similar&#13;
contexts, including post-conflict situations.&#13;
&#13;
Collectively, the lessons and experiences from the MDF and JRF form a legacy of the remarkable&#13;
achievements of these two programs and the effective partnerships on which they were based.&#13;
We hope that the lessons captured in these papers will contribute to future reconstruction and&#13;
preparedness efforts in Indonesia and other disaster-prone countries around the world.&#13;

                                     Indonesia is one of the most disaster prone countries in the world. It is vulnerable to earthquakes,&#13;
                                     tsunamis, landslides, floods, volcanic eruptions, and wildfires. Between 2004 and 2010 Indonesia&#13;
                                     experienced a series of devastating natural disasters which attracted an outpouring of support&#13;
                                     from around the world.&#13;
&#13;
                                     December 2004â&#128;&#148;Earthquake and Tsunami in Aceh&#13;
&#13;
                                     The earthquake and tsunami that struck Indonesia and several other countries in the Indian Ocean&#13;
                                     region on December 26, 2004 was one of the worst natural disasters in recorded human history.&#13;
                                     The massive earthquake measuring 9.1 on the Richter scale was centered in the Indian Ocean&#13;
                                     about 150 kilometers off the coast of the province of Aceh on the northernmost tip of the island&#13;
                                     of Sumatra. Huge tidal waves fanned across the Indian Ocean, causing death and destruction&#13;
                                     across Southern Asia including Thailand, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, and as far away as East&#13;
                                     Africa. No country suffered more than Indonesia. Waves towering ten meters high came&#13;
                                     crashing into the shoreline in Aceh. The scale of physical devastation and human suffering was&#13;
                                     enormous. In Aceh alone, 221,000 people were killed or missing, and over a half million were left&#13;
                                     homeless. As many as 750,000 people lost their livelihoods. At all levels, infrastructure was&#13;
                                     paralyzed or completely destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
                                     In minutes, human settlements along the coastline of Aceh and parts of North Sumatra were&#13;
                                     demolished. People, houses, boats, cars, and buildings were engulfed as the tsunami swallowed&#13;
                                     everything in its way. Villages were reduced to rubble where minutes before thriving communities&#13;
                                     had flourished. Many roads, bridges, communications systems, schools, hospitals and clinics&#13;
                                     collapsed or were severely damaged. Fishermen, farmers and others lost their livelihoods and&#13;
                                     many businesses were destroyed or could no longer operate.&#13;
&#13;
                                     The subsequent assessment of the impact of both disasters, conducted by the Government along&#13;
                                     with the World Bank and other partners, assessed the damage and needs to be US$4.9 billion.1 This&#13;
                                     figure was later revised to $6.2 billion.&#13;
&#13;
                                     The massive destruction in Aceh seriously affected provincial and local governments already&#13;
                                     weakened by years of conflict. The tsunami destroyed 21 percent of public buildings and 19 percent&#13;
                                     of the equipment in these buildings. Approximately nine percent of civil servants perished and at&#13;
                                     least 21 percent of surviving civil servants were severely affected, impacting their ability to function&#13;
                                     as a local government. Twenty-seven percent of public records were destroyed. The replacement&#13;
                                     value of these losses was estimated to be over $81 million.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Prior to the tsunami, governance in Aceh already faced numerous challenges, including lack of&#13;
                                     institutional capacity and inefficient delivery of public services such as health and education,&#13;
                                     especially in the rural areas. The tsunami exacerbated these challenges to say the least, and the&#13;

Many people were saved from the tsunami by taking refuge in Acehâ&#128;&#153;s Grand Mosque. They       Photo:&#13;
could only watch helplessly as the torrent raged through the streets, carrying debris and   Antara News&#13;
victims along with it.                                                                      Agency&#13;
&#13;
provincial and local governments were not in a position to manage the immense and extensive&#13;
recovery effort that would be required. The national government stepped in urgently to take the&#13;
lead in the reconstruction process.&#13;
&#13;
March 2005â&#128;&#148;Earthquake in North Sumatra and Aceh&#13;
&#13;
Just three months later on March 28, 2005, another massive earthquake measuring 8.7 on the&#13;
Richter scale struck Aceh and the neighboring province of North Sumatra. This quake devastated&#13;
the Nias islands in the province of North Sumatra, located in the Indian Ocean 130 kilometers off&#13;
the western coast of Sumatra just south of Aceh. The island of Simeulue, part of the province of&#13;
Aceh off the western coast of the mainland, was also hard hit. This second disaster resulted in the&#13;
death of nearly 1,000 people and the displacement of nearly 50,000 survivors. The earthquake&#13;
wreaked more havoc on an already ravaged area. The physical damage was severe. Approximately&#13;
30 percent of buildings were destroyed. The destruction rendered transportation and other critical&#13;
infrastructure inoperative, including the major ports linking the remote island populations with the&#13;
mainland. Nias and Simeulue stood among the poorest areas of Indonesia prior to the disasters and&#13;
were only further isolated by the destruction of the earthquake.&#13;
&#13;
These two disasters devastated two areas of Indonesia that were already grappling with multiple&#13;
challenges. The province of Aceh was in the grip of an internal conflict between the Acehnese&#13;

                                     had paralyzed development and economic growth, and had seriously weakened both public and&#13;
                                     private sector capacities. At the time of the December 2004 tsunami, poverty in Aceh was 28.4&#13;
                                     percent, substantially higher than the national average of 16.7 percent.2 The districts of Nias&#13;
                                     and South Nias on Nias Island ranked among the poorest districts in Indonesia. Poverty, largely&#13;
                                     attributable to the isolation of the island, was approximately 31 percent at the time of the March&#13;
                                     2005 earthquake.3 These dual challenges of poverty and isolation created an extremely difficult&#13;
                                     operating environment for reconstruction in Nias.&#13;
                                     	&#13;
                                     The local governments, already weakened by the conflict in Aceh and isolation in Nias, were&#13;
                                     initially overwhelmed by the disasters. Recognizing this, and recognizing the magnitude of the&#13;
                                     reconstruction task at hand, the central government created the Agency for the Reconstruction&#13;
                                     and Rehabilitation of Aceh and Nias (Badan Rekonstruksi dan Rehabilitasi Aceh dan Nias, widely&#13;
                                     known as the BRR) to manage reconstruction. This special agency was based in Aceh and led by a&#13;
                                     minister-level appointee who reported directly to the President.&#13;

May 2006â&#128;&#148;Earthquake in Java&#13;
&#13;
Disaster again struck Indonesia on May 27, 2006, when an earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter&#13;
scale hit the island of Java, resulting in extensive damage in the province of Central Java and the&#13;
Special Region of Yogyakarta. The earthquake hit one of the most densely populated areas in Asia,&#13;
claiming more than 5,700 lives and destroying over 280,000 homes. Damage to private houses made&#13;
up more than 60 percent of the total destruction, which also affected small and medium enterprises,&#13;
a large number of them home-based industries. While infrastructure suffered comparatively less&#13;
damage, hundreds of thousands of homes and smaller structures were destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
Many houses in the area had been built without proper reinforcement and with low quality&#13;
building materials, resulting in more deaths and damage than would normally be expected from&#13;
an earthquake of this magnitude. Approximately 40,000 people were injured in the earthquake.&#13;
Thousands of people were trapped and buried beneath their toppled houses and buildings.&#13;
&#13;
A joint team led by the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas), with local governments&#13;
and the international community, prepared the preliminary Damage and Loss Assessment in order&#13;
to determine the overall needs for the rehabilitation and reconstruction phase. Total damage and&#13;
losses from the earthquake were estimated at around $3.1 billion.&#13;
&#13;
The economic impact of the earthquake was particularly heavy because of the concentration of&#13;
home-based industries in the areas destroyed by the earthquake. More than 650,000 workers&#13;
were employed in economic activities directly affected by the earthquake with close to 90 percent&#13;
of damage and losses concentrated in small and medium enterprises. Many of the home-based&#13;
industries in the areaâ&#128;&#153;s important handicraft sector were severely affected. Rebuilding homes&#13;
would also support recovery of home-based businesses and livelihoods.&#13;
&#13;
July 2006â&#128;&#148;West Java Tsunami&#13;
&#13;
Just two months later, on July 17, 2006, a second major submarine earthquake struck off the&#13;
southern coast of Java. The earthquake, measuring a magnitude of 7.7 on the Richter scale,&#13;
triggered a tsunami that caused widespread damage. The tsunami hit the south coast of West&#13;
Java, taking more than 650 lives and displacing over 28,000 people. Almost 1,000 people died&#13;
or remained missing and more than 50,000 people were displaced. Damage and losses reached&#13;
an estimated $112 million. Ciamis district, West Java, was the worst affected. Along the coast of&#13;
Ciamis alone, close to 6,000 families were displaced. The tsunami caused economic destruction in&#13;
the fishing villages and tourist resorts along the south coast of West Java, where large numbers of&#13;
fishing boats were lost and the small fishing ports destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
October and November 2010â&#128;&#148;Mount Merapi Volcanic Eruptions&#13;
&#13;
On October 26, 2010, disaster hit Java once again when Mount Merapi, a volcano located on the&#13;
border between Yogyakarta and Central Java, erupted. This was followed by seven additional major&#13;
eruptions, with the last one occurring on November 11, 2010. For two long weeks, the eruptions&#13;

                                     spewed hot gas into nearby villages and hot lava accompanied by hot gas flowed into several&#13;
                                     rivers. The clouds of hot ash and poisonous gas combined with heat clouds at temperatures of 600&#13;
                                     to 800 degrees Celsius incinerated everything they reached, including livestock, crops and trees&#13;
                                     that were essential to the livelihoods of evacuees. Ash rain, which blanketed everything in fine&#13;
                                     volcanic dust, was found in cities across Java. All villages within 20 kilometers of the crater were&#13;
                                     evacuated. Along with massive damage to local infrastructure, approximately 2,900 houses were&#13;
                                     destroyed and 350,000 people were displaced and accommodated in evacuation camps. Due to&#13;
                                     timely evacuation, casualties were limited but still almost 300 people perished and more than 500&#13;
                                     were injured. The eruptions impacted areas in the province of Central Java and the Yogyakarta&#13;
                                     Special Region, including some communities that had been affected by the 2006 earthquake and&#13;
                                     were still in the process of rebuilding.&#13;
&#13;
                                     These eruptions resulted in widespread damage to housing and local infrastructure, as well as&#13;
                                     loss of livelihoods. During the eruptions, volcanic debris mixed with rain flowed down the slopes&#13;
                                     of Mount Merapi as massive mud flows. In Java this is known as â&#128;&#156;lahar dinginâ&#128;&#157; or cold lava and&#13;
                                     is made up of ash and sand from the eruption which when combined with rain turns into thick,&#13;
                                     slushy rivers of mud that gather up everything in the way. Cold lava surged down the mountain&#13;
                                     burying entire villages, farms and fields. Huge boulders, trees, houses, livestock, motor bikes, and&#13;
                                     cars were carried away by the mud. Several villages located in the danger zone near the volcano&#13;
                                     were relocated to safer areas.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Facing the Future&#13;
&#13;
                                     The numerous disasters since 2004 are a stark reminder that Indonesia is highly prone to natural&#13;
                                     hazards. Improvements in early warning systems are expected to save lives, as will ensuring that&#13;
                                     homes and other structures are built to seismic resistant standards. Many of the homes destroyed&#13;
                                     during the earthquakes were found to have used poor quality materials and building techniques,&#13;
                                     both of which contributed greatly to the number of lives lost and the high level of damage. Through&#13;
                                     the recovery and reconstruction efforts following these disasters, Indonesia has learned many&#13;
                                     lessons. It has created institutions and put systems in place for disaster risk reduction. As a result&#13;
                                     of the recovery and reconstruction process communities across Aceh, Nias, and Java are more&#13;
                                     resilient to face future disasters.&#13;

The Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF) was established in April 2005, in response to&#13;
the Government of Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s request to coordinate donor support for the reconstruction and&#13;
rehabilitation of affected areas following the December 2004 earthquake and tsunami, and the&#13;
subsequent March 2005 earthquake.&#13;
&#13;
The MDF pools $655 million in contributions from 15 donors. These funds amount to nearly ten&#13;
percent of the overall reconstruction funds. At the request of the Government of Indonesia, the&#13;
World Bank serves as Trustee of the MDF. Grant funds are provided to projects which are&#13;
implemented by government and non-government agencies and communities, with partner&#13;
agencies providing oversight. Partner agencies include the United Nations Development Programme&#13;
(UNDP), the World Food Programme (WFP), the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Under the MDF portfolio, 23 projects were financed in six outcome areas: (1) Recovery of&#13;
Communities; (2) Reconstruction and Rehabilitation of Large Infrastructure and Transport; (3)&#13;
Strengthening Governance and Capacity Building; (4) Sustaining the Environment; (5) Enhancing&#13;
the Recovery Process; and (6) Economic Development and Livelihoods. These projects reflected the&#13;
priorities of the Indonesian government throughout the reconstruction process.&#13;
&#13;
The MDF was coordinated by the Government of Indonesia, initially through the Agency for&#13;
the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Aceh and Nias (BRR), which was set up to manage the&#13;
reconstruction and recovery effort. After the BRR closed in April 2009, the National Development&#13;
Planning Agency, Bappenas, took on this critical role. The MDF is governed by a Steering Committee&#13;
with representatives from the government, donors, the trustee, and civil society. The Steering&#13;
Committee is supported in its work by a secretariat.&#13;

                                                     between government, donors, communities and other stakeholders. The partnerships created&#13;
                                                     by the MDF have played a key role in the strong performance of the program and robust results&#13;
                                                     achieved. Pooling resources through the MDF has resulted in the harmonization of donor efforts&#13;
                                                     and provided an important platform for policy dialogue for many stakeholders. The MDF has&#13;
                                                     filled gaps in the reconstruction in line with government priorities and has brought together key&#13;

                                           Following a request from the Government of Indonesia, the Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF) was&#13;
                                           established to respond to the May 27, 2006 earthquake that struck near Yogyakarta, and the&#13;
                                           tsunami that hit the southern coast of West Java Province in July 2006. The JRF was later extended&#13;
                                           to respond to volcanic eruptions of Mount Merapi in October and November of 2010. The JRF&#13;
                                           program closed on December 31, 2012.&#13;
&#13;
                                           The JRF is based on the successful model of the Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias. Seven&#13;
                                           donors supported the JRF with contributions totaling $94.1 million. The donors are: the European&#13;
                                           Union, the Governments of the Netherlands, United Kingdom, the Asian Development Bank,&#13;
                                           Canada, Finland and Denmark. The World Bank serves as Trustee of the JRF. Following the&#13;
                                           governmentâ&#128;&#153;s priorities, the JRF supports the recovery of communities and livelihoods, and increases&#13;
                                           disaster preparedness.&#13;
&#13;
                                           The JRF was coordinated by the Government of Indonesia, initially through the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                                           National Coordinating Team (NCT) and the National Technical Team (TTN). After the mandate of&#13;
                                           the NCT and the TTN ended in 2008, the JRF worked with the National Planning Agency (Bappenas)&#13;
                                           and the Provincial Planning Agencies (Bappeda) for the overall coordination of the reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Using a governance structure similar to the MDF, the JRF was governed by a Steering Committee&#13;
                                           with representatives from the Government of Indonesia and donors. Bappenas co-chaired the&#13;
                                           Steering Committee, along with the European Union as the largest donor, and the World Bank&#13;
                                           as Trustee. The Steering Committee is supported by a secretariat. Through shared staffing and&#13;
                                           expertise with the MDF for Aceh and Nias, the secretariat achieved efficiencies of scale, resulting in&#13;
                                           reduced program administration costs.&#13;
&#13;
                                           The JRF portfolio consisted of five projects which drew from the MDFâ&#128;&#153;s experience and used a&#13;
                                           phased approach to address: (1) Transitional Housing; (2) Restoring Housing and Community&#13;
                                           Infrastructure; and (3) Restoring Livelihoods. The World Bank had a supervisory and oversight role&#13;

The JRF Portfolio&#13;
&#13;
The JRF portfolio followed a phased approach to reconstruction, adopting lessons learned from&#13;
the MDF. Early support focused on meeting housing and community recovery needs and&#13;
subsequent support focused on addressing economic recovery. The JRF prioritized disaster risk&#13;
reduction in all its programs. Five projects were supported:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Transitional Housing Projects (2 projects totaling $2.3 million). The JRF financed two transitional&#13;
housing projects, implemented by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and&#13;
Cooperative Housing Foundation (CHF) International and managed by the World Bank. The projects&#13;
provided nearly 5,000 transitional shelters.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The Community-based Settlement Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (1 project&#13;
totaling $75.1 million), better known as Rekompak, made up most of the JRF funding allocation.&#13;
Following the model established in Aceh, it used a community driven approach to rebuild homes&#13;
and local infrastructure in earthquake affected areas of Yogyakarta Special District, and Central&#13;
Java, and later, parts of West Java affected by a subsequent earthquake and tsunami. After&#13;
the 2010 eruptions of Mount Merapi, the project was expanded further. Implemented by the&#13;
Ministry of Public Works (MPW) and managed by the World Bank, the project rebuilt over 15,000&#13;
houses and completed over 4,000 local infrastructure projects.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Livelihood Recovery Projects (2 projects totaling $17.1 million):&#13;
   -	The Livelihood Recovery in Yogyakarta Special District and Central Java project&#13;
   contributed to the Government of Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s initiatives to assist micro, small and medium&#13;
   enterprises (MSMEs) affected by the earthquake to revitalize their businesses and re integrate&#13;
   affected low-income communities into economic life. The project provided access to finance,&#13;
   developed loan work-out strategies for defaulting borrowers, restored capacity and improved&#13;
   competitiveness of medium-sized companies in Yogyakarta and Central Java. The project&#13;
   was implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and&#13;
   managed by the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
  -	 The Access to Finance and Capacity Building for Earthquake Affected Micro             and Small&#13;
  Enterprises project, implemented by the IOM and managed by the World Bank,               supported&#13;
  the recovery of micro and small enterprises in Yogyakarta and Central Java               to enable&#13;
  them to reach their pre-earthquake capacity. It provided asset replacement,              marketing&#13;
  support, and techical assistance. The project worked with over 4,000 micro               and small&#13;
  enterprises (MSEs), over 40 percent run or owned by women.&#13;

Executive Summary&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                        The natural disasters of late 2004 and early 2005 left a trail of human loss and&#13;
                        destruction in Aceh and Nias: more than 220,000 people dead or missing, 700,000&#13;
                        rendered homeless, livelihoods disrupted, infrastructure damaged, and debilitated&#13;
                        local government. Capacities of the people and institutions of these regions were&#13;
                        already lagging behind other regions in Indonesia prior to the disasters, undermined&#13;
                        by conflict in Aceh and relative isolation in Nias.&#13;
&#13;
                        An unprecedented response by Indonesians, international citizens and development&#13;
                        agencies provided Aceh and Nias with the opportunity to â&#128;&#152;build back betterâ&#128;&#153; - the&#13;
                        rallying call of the President of Indonesia as the government opened access to Aceh and&#13;
                        welcomed assistance. The MDF was launched in May 2005 to coordinate international&#13;
                        donor assistance, led by the Government of Indonesia. Working closely with the&#13;
                        special coordinating agency created for the Aceh and Nias reconstruction effort, the&#13;
                        Agency for the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Aceh and Nias (BRR), and other&#13;
                        stakeholders, the MDF provided $655 million to fund 23 projects, contributing about&#13;
                        ten percent of the total recovery funds.&#13;
&#13;
                        Infrastructure was indeed â&#128;&#156;built back betterâ&#128;&#157; in Aceh and Nias, and capacity building&#13;
                        was extended to address the sustainability of investments and deeper governance&#13;
                        issues. The transformation seen over the last seven years has been remarkable. Credit&#13;
                        must go largely to the people of Aceh and Nias, who have tirelessly struggled to&#13;
                        regain their homes, livelihoods and communities. Individually, in community groups,&#13;
                        and through small and medium enterprises, they have addressed urgent survival&#13;
                        needs and rebuilt or enhanced their local public and private sector institutions.&#13;
                        Leaders in the public sector, at all levels of government, have made their important&#13;
                        contribution, stepping up to the challenge of managing the emergency, rehabilitation&#13;
                        and reconstruction efforts.&#13;
&#13;
                        As the recovery effort proceeded, the MDF and other development partners were&#13;
                        drawn to address capacity gaps relating to governance challenges specific to the regions&#13;
                        (maintaining the peace in Aceh, and reversing regional isolation/neglect in Nias), or&#13;
                        those pervasive nationally (public financial management, civil service reforms). The&#13;
                        MDF made a significant contribution to the recovery through addressing various layers&#13;
                        of capacity needs.&#13;
&#13;
                        Capacity building has proven to be an essential component to make the most of&#13;
                        recovery investments. Enhancing skills in participatory planning for housing and&#13;
                        community infrastructure allowed for decisions that were acceptable to communities&#13;
                        and ensured good use of the rebuilt facilities. Capacity building was also instrumental&#13;
                        in ensuring that the newly-built infrastructure would find a proper institutional home&#13;
                        and continue to be well operated and maintained. Moreover, where good practices&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                           23&#13;

                                                                                                   Building Capacity:&#13;
Commuties, like this one in Aceh Besar, learn how to engage in local planning and       Photo:&#13;
decision making. Through the MDFâ&#128;&#153;s Support for Poor and Disadvantaged Areas program,    Kristin&#13;
communities gained the know-how to effectively participate in the Musrembang process,   Thompson&#13;
a mechanism that feeds community-identified needs into local government action plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
were introduced in the planning and implementation of projects, capacity building&#13;
components helped to anchor these to government units and stakeholders who could&#13;
sustain them or expand them after the projects closed. Capacity building was also&#13;
directed to longer-term governance challenges, such as the elaboration of the Law on&#13;
Governing Aceh, and financial management and civil service reforms.&#13;
&#13;
Capacity building efforts related to individual/community level investments yielded&#13;
large returns. Embedding and disseminating good practices in subnational government&#13;
was more difficult, and many stakeholders felt that more time was needed to properly&#13;
achieve this end. Addressing deeper gaps in the capacity for good governance&#13;
was most challenging of allâ&#128;&#148;this was not an explicit part of the MDF mandate, but&#13;
recovery investments would be better safeguarded if certain governance reforms&#13;
could be achieved.&#13;
&#13;
A detailed assessment of MDF performance in capacity building is hampered by&#13;
weak capacity building frameworks in MDF and its projects. Quantitative data and&#13;
field narratives support the case for MDFâ&#128;&#153;s significant capacity building contribution.&#13;
Hundreds of thousands were involved in community planning and mobilization&#13;

&#13;

                    improve techniques in cultivating peppers and eggplant. Over 3,700 farmers participated      LEDP Project&#13;
                    in livelihood and economic development trainings over the projectâ&#128;&#153;s lifespan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    exercises. Tens of thousands of farmers, entrepreneurs and subnational government&#13;
                    staff were trained in a wide range of fields. Organizational improvements were made in&#13;
                    hundreds of civil society organizations (CSOs), private sector entities and subnational&#13;
                    government units. MDFâ&#128;&#153;s support helped develop dozens of legal instruments, policies&#13;
                    and guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
                    The MDF did not establish explicit capacity building frameworks for its projects. The&#13;
                    focus for many projects was on physical improvements, and the objectives relating to&#13;
                    capacity to demonstrate, institutionalize, or disseminate took a back seat to meeting&#13;
                    urgent and readily apparent needs.&#13;
&#13;
                    It is also fair to say that the MDFâ&#128;&#153;s initial efforts to address longer standing governance&#13;
                    challenges were limited, and yielded only modest results. Early on, the need to ensure&#13;
                    a speedy recovery ranked above other concerns, and the MDFâ&#128;&#153;s mandate was to fill&#13;
                    reconstruction gaps in various sectorsâ&#128;&#148;especially infrastructure. However, the MDF&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       25&#13;

                                                                                               Experiences from Post-Disaster Aceh and Nias&#13;
                                                                                               Building Capacity:&#13;
was drawn into the area of building governance capacity by demand rather than&#13;
design, as it began to appreciate the importance of these issues for the sustainability&#13;
of benefits arising from its entire portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
The MDFâ&#128;&#153;s capacity building approach became more intensive and more robust over the&#13;
recovery period. Over its seven-year life, the MDFâ&#128;&#153;s capacity building effort can be seen as&#13;
an evolution, beginning with a weak foundation when it was focused on â&#128;&#152;getting the job&#13;
doneâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#148;at this time providing limited capacity building support, or sometimes providing&#13;
â&#128;&#152;replacement/substitutionâ&#128;&#153; forms of capacity building. Soon MDF project begin to give&#13;
more emphasis to capacity building. Project documents for extensions and new phases&#13;
of implementation show more intensive approaches to capacity building and more&#13;
robust frameworks than their earlier phases. MDF projects approved at later stages of&#13;
the program contained more intensive capacity building componentsâ&#128;&#148;addressing not&#13;
only recovery but also fundamental, longer term governance challenges particular to&#13;
Aceh or Nias, and common throughout Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
The MDFâ&#128;&#153;s capacity building approach compares well with emerging international good&#13;
practices in post-disaster settings. Some examples of these good practices include:&#13;
the purposeful inclusion of capacity building components in project designs; selecting&#13;
appropriate entry points and levels of capacity building as a focus; developing an&#13;
adequate baseline and indicators; and reporting sufficiently on the achievements&#13;
against indicators. The attention given to capacity building in a post-disaster setting,&#13;
particularly toward the end of a projectâ&#128;&#153;s life, is in keeping with the lessons drawn from&#13;
these settings. Its contingent and flexible use of various forms of capacity building&#13;
(from substitution to very endogenous models, individual to system level entry&#13;
points) and delivery modalities are in line with accepted practices in settings where&#13;
capacity is initially low but improving. Extending the scope of the recovery to include&#13;
relevant governance challenges places it in the forefront of post-disaster settingsâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
notwithstanding the difficulties faced in taking on this layer of capacity needs.&#13;
&#13;
The MDFâ&#128;&#153;s capacity building experience provides some lessons relevant to post-&#13;
disaster settings in Indonesia and elsewhere. For government and supporting actors,&#13;
the Aceh and Nias experience, particularly of the MDF projects, gives rise to the&#13;
following lessons:&#13;
&#13;
1.	 â&#128;&#152;Building back betterâ&#128;&#153; should encompass both improved physical infrastructure and&#13;
    enhanced governance capacities, if resources are sufficient.&#13;
2.	 A critical component of any Needs Assessment or Damage and Loss Assessment&#13;
    should be to include measures to estimate capacity challenges and needs, even if&#13;
    this is a preliminary or â&#128;&#156;quick and dirtyâ&#128;&#157; estimate. This allows the development of&#13;
    an evolving strategy for capacity building over time.&#13;
&amp;#12;26&#13;
Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    3.	 Capacity building efforts take time and may require a longer timeframe than&#13;
                        the official recovery period allows. This is especially true in tackling governance&#13;
                        challenges that demand organizational and systemic changes. It is important to&#13;
                        appreciate the magnitude of the various challenges.&#13;
                    4.	 Pressure to get the job doneâ&#128;&#148;with ad hoc approaches, often relying on capacity&#13;
                        substitutionâ&#128;&#148;will be at odds with the need to apply serious and rigorous approaches,&#13;
                        and will not provide the space that is essential for endogenous capacity building&#13;
                        which leads to sustainability.&#13;
                    5.	 Even with â&#128;&#152;pragmaticâ&#128;&#153; approaches to capacity building, a degree of methodological&#13;
                        rigor is needed from the start, particularly in linking capacity building contributions&#13;
                        to sustainability of facilities or reforms.&#13;
                    6.	 The tension between a quick response and a robust capacity building approach can&#13;
                        be lessened by creating ready-made instruments to be applied in a proper division&#13;
                        of labor and in a timely way by government and development partners. These could&#13;
                        include:&#13;
                        â&#128;¢	 Undertaking capacity assessments to establish adequate baselines and indicators.&#13;
                        â&#128;¢	 Transferring assets (those built by government agencies through regular budget&#13;
                            lines, or others outside of budget process).&#13;
                        â&#128;¢	 Understanding the legal framework for subnational government roles/functions&#13;
                            and financing (how funds can be channeled through appropriate budget&#13;
                            mechanisms).&#13;
                    7. Getting maximum benefit from a multi-donor fund in capacity building means:&#13;
                        â&#128;¢	 Assisting government in shaping an effective overarching capacity building&#13;
                            framework.&#13;
                        â&#128;¢	 Developing clear capacity building guidelines for its partners/projects.&#13;
                        â&#128;¢	 Coordinating effectively with capacity building initiatives funded outside of its&#13;
                            platform.&#13;
                        â&#128;¢	 Employing a flexible approach to delivery modalities, in line with ultimate&#13;
                            objectives.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   27&#13;

                                                                                           Building Capacity:&#13;
A great deal has been achieved and learned, and challenges remain that invite&#13;
continued partnerships with the people of Aceh and Nias. Aceh and Nias have been&#13;
built back better in many respects. Capacity building components of the MDF projects&#13;
were critical to impact, sustainability of recovery investments, and the efforts to&#13;
address longer term governance challenges. The MDF launched into its work with a&#13;
commitment to be responsive to government, and with the mindset of â&#128;&#152;getting the&#13;
job done.â&#128;&#153; It showed an evolution over time in its capacity building approaches, with&#13;
a greater emphasis on governance and sustainability as the MDF neared its end. In&#13;
retrospect, the MDF could have pushed for a more intensive and coherent approach&#13;
to capacity building in its portfolio, assisting the government to forge a more explicit&#13;
capacity building strategy for the recovery as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
In Aceh and Nias, the end of the reconstruction presents an opportunity to take&#13;
stock of progress and remaining capacity gaps. Capacity challenges in Aceh and Nias&#13;
remain, and the newly enhanced capacity will be tested in the future from challenges&#13;
such as further natural disasters and the demands for accelerated development.&#13;
Many of the challenges have to do with good governance. Aceh and Nias have emerged&#13;
from the reconstruction experience in a better position to address these challenges as&#13;
a result of the capacity building achieved through the recovery process.&#13;

POST-DISASTER CAPACITY CHALLENGES&#13;

      1.1	 Weak Local Government Capacity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                Experiences from Post-Disaster Aceh and Nias&#13;
                                                                                                                Building Capacity:&#13;
                    In Aceh and North Sumatra, particularly Nias, the natural disasters of late 2004 and&#13;
                    early 2005 left more than 220,000 people dead or missing, rendered homeless over&#13;
                    635,000 others, destroyed hundreds of communities, hampered or stopped the&#13;
                    functioning of many sub-national governments, and disrupted social, economic and&#13;
                    political life in the affected areas.&#13;
&#13;
                    Private sector and households suffered the most damages and losses. Notably, the&#13;
                    provincial and local governments themselves were not as badly hit and rebounded&#13;
                    quickly. An early assessment made by the World Bank in 2005 in four tsunami-affected&#13;
                    districts showed that on average nine percent of the civil servants were killed in the&#13;
                    disasters, with Banda Aceh the worst affected, where casualties reached 20 percent&#13;
                    of all staff.1&#13;
&#13;
                    The natural disaster set back the operations of some provincial and local governments,&#13;
                    while leaving others relatively unscathed. Provincial and local government vacancies in&#13;
                    higher echelons were quickly filled through promotions, leaving vacant positions only&#13;
                    at the lowest echelons, filled in the months that followed.2&#13;
&#13;
                    Most buildings damaged by the disasters in affected districts were still usable, as was&#13;
                    the office equipment in those buildings. Calang was a notable exception, where all&#13;
                    offices were destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
                    Replacing staff and upgrading offices did not translate immediately into adequate&#13;
                    service delivery, in Aceh or Nias. Even prior to the disasters, provincial and local&#13;
                    government was performing poorly. Although Aceh had been given a special form of&#13;
                    autonomy in 2001, including preferential financial transfers from oil and natural gas, it&#13;
                    had not been able to make good use of this enlarged autonomy. After the tsunami, and&#13;
                    even with replenished staff and offices, local governments continued to be lethargic,&#13;
                    with low attendance level and short working hours. Local parliaments continued to be&#13;
                    lax in their oversight and did not have the trust or respect of the public.&#13;

                                                             The relative isolation of Aceh and the low-intensity, yet persistent conflict had eroded&#13;

                                                             government capacity in Aceh. This corrosive effect was also reflected in the slow&#13;
                                                             growth of civil society, depriving Aceh of an important vehicle for holding government&#13;
                                                             accountable. The conflict also destroyed infrastructure, restricted movement, and&#13;
                                                             created a general sense of insecurity and distrust of government among societal&#13;
                                                             groupings.&#13;

                                                             Similarly, local government performance in Nias had long been hampered by its&#13;
                                                             relative isolation and neglect. To attract additional resources and spur development&#13;
                                                             in Niasâ&#128;&#153; depressed local economy, the two districts on the island were subdivided into&#13;
                                                             four districts and one municipality. The first regional subdivision in Nias occurred in&#13;

&#13;
                                                             The disaster was followed by an ambitious effort by the Government of Indonesia&#13;
                                                             to â&#128;&#156;build back better.â&#128;&#157; Unprecedented support from national and international&#13;
                                                             organizations helped rebuild and improve physical infrastructure and restore&#13;
                                                             livelihoods. Within months of the disaster, crumbled buildings and debris were cleaned&#13;
                                                             up, and recycled where possible. Over the ensuing months and years, thousands of&#13;
                                                             homes were rebuilt. Damaged land was rehabilitated to allow affected producers to&#13;
                                                             once again pursue agricultural livelihoods. Commerce was reestablished, thanks to&#13;
                                                             replaced and improved infrastructure, including ports, roads, and telecommunications.&#13;
&#13;
                                                             Capacity building proved to be crucial to the sustainability of investments made in&#13;
                                                             service provision and economic development. Citizens, communities, civil society&#13;
                                                             organizations (CSOs) and local governments engaged in decision making and gained&#13;
                                                             greater capacity to play their respective roles. People learned the skills necessary to&#13;
                                                             take part in local planning, to rebuild their homes and communities, and to pursue a&#13;

Capacity building for the Provincial Disaster Management Agency (BPBA) included training   Photo:&#13;
government officials from multiple agencies on logistics and emergency communications      Akil&#13;
that is vital for managing disaster response programs. MDFâ&#128;&#153;s disaster risk reduction       Abduljalil&#13;
program helped to establish the BPBA office in Banda Aceh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Efforts were made to strengthen CSOs as well as provincial and local governments.&#13;
CSOs had been boosted, particularly in urban centers, as targets of capacity building&#13;
programs, partners in development programs, or through experience working for&#13;
organizations involved in the reconstruction. CSOs and citizens became more active&#13;
and engaged with local government, including engagement in legislative work. Local&#13;
community groups, village governments and sub-district level administrations were&#13;
strengthened in planning, project management, and broader governance roles.&#13;
&#13;
Government offices were rehabilitated, bolstered by new equipment, newly hired&#13;
staff, and a wide range of training. Government staff, especially in district government,&#13;
were provided with improved information systems, planning methodologies, and&#13;
other management tools. Considerable attention was placed on asset transfer and&#13;
asset management to ensure that public infrastructure would be properly operated&#13;
and maintained. All of the above efforts focused on the affected regions, but to some&#13;
degree were extended to all district governments and many sub-district governments.&#13;
&#13;
Over time, the provincial and local governments shouldered more responsibility for&#13;
the reconstruction as time passed, especially after the Agency for the Reconstruction&#13;
and Rehabilitation of Aceh and Nias (BRR) closed in April 2009. Some staff of BRR,&#13;
with improved skills forged in an environment where performance was stressed, found&#13;
their way back to national, provincial, district and city governments, infusing them&#13;
with their new energies and experiences.&#13;

                                                              The Government of Indonesia was represented in Aceh and Nias largely through&#13;
                                                              the Agency for the Reconstruction and Rehabilitation of Aceh and Nias (BRR), which&#13;
                                                              provided the leadership for capacity building. Initially, capacity building was not seen&#13;
                                                              as a priority. BRRâ&#128;&#153;s primary mission was to implement reconstruction and rehabilitation&#13;
                                                              work, as well to provide coordination, leadership, and quality control of the activities&#13;
                                                              financed by the government, donors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).&#13;
                                                              The BRR operated on some principles that are common to capacity building practice.&#13;
                                                              For instance, BRR believed it needed to boost the capacity of provincial and district&#13;
                                                              governments so they could carry on reconstruction work after the closure of BRR. It&#13;
                                                              sought to reach all districts and cities in an equitable way by establishing regional&#13;
                                                              offices. As the BRRâ&#128;&#153;s mandate was to work in areas affected both directly and indirectly&#13;
                                                              by the disasters, it promoted these principles in the MDFâ&#128;&#153;s strategy, urging it to extend&#13;

                                                              The BRR itself was the focus of capacity building efforts, especially as it ramped up its&#13;

                                                              Capacity building increased during the recovery period, both within ongoing projects&#13;

      Figure 1 shows capacity building as a low priority initially, and increasing in intensity as&#13;
      the housing and physical structures peaked and declined. This suggests that demand&#13;
      for capacity building increased as the recovery progressed, and that capacity building&#13;
      activities became more â&#128;&#152;stand-aloneâ&#128;&#153; from other recovery activities.&#13;
&#13;
      Another feature worth noting is the symmetry in the waxing and waning of the curves&#13;
      representing the categories of activities outlined by the ANUE team, as compared&#13;
      to the capacity building curve, which appears prematurely truncated. The curve&#13;
      has been given this shape to reflect that capacity building activities were curtailed&#13;
      as development partnersâ&#128;&#153; activities come to an end. However, the rapid descent of&#13;
      the capacity building curve suggests that the underlying challenges persist, even after&#13;
      many of the other more visible undertakings were concluded. â&#128;&#156;Building back betterâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
      was achieved in the physical sense, but ongoing capacity building is still needed for a&#13;
      more sustained completion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.4	 Addressing Multi-Level Capacity Challenges&#13;
      Development partners have played an important role in supporting all aspects of the&#13;
      recovery. Development partnersâ&#128;&#153; efforts in capacity building went beyond the effects&#13;
      of the natural disaster to include issues related to the legacy of conflict in Aceh and the&#13;
      relative isolation of Nias, and longer term development challenges.&#13;
&#13;
      During the course of the recovery of Aceh and Nias, different types of capacity&#13;
      challenges and needs were identified and addressed by development partners,&#13;
      including the MDF [Figure 2]. This experience underscores the importance of&#13;
      differentiating the various layers of capacity challenges that may be identified and&#13;
      addressed in post-disaster settings. The most obvious challenges are related to the&#13;
&amp;#12;34&#13;
                                                basic and urgent capacity needs associated with the disaster recovery and future risk&#13;

                                                management. These constitute the first layer in Figure 2 and were largely supported&#13;
                                                by the MDF and development partners during the recovery process in Aceh and&#13;
                                                Nias. A related capacity challenge at this level was created by the inventory of&#13;
                                                reconstructed assets. Finding a home for these assets entailed a complex set of legal&#13;
                                                and administrative processes that could not be completed during the life cycles of the&#13;
                                                projects that created them. This challenge has been partially met but is expected to&#13;
                                                be resolved over time.&#13;
&#13;
                                                At the second level shown in Figure 2 were challenges specific to the history and context&#13;
                                                of the affected areas, reflecting the post-conflict situation in Aceh and the isolation of&#13;
                                                Nias, but not directly linked to the disasters. The MDF and development partners have&#13;
                                                made significant but partial contributions to addressing these challenges during the&#13;
                                                reconstruction. For example, in Nias, transportation infrastructure was provided to&#13;
                                                link the islandâ&#128;&#153;s remote communities and facilitate farmersâ&#128;&#153; access to markets. Support&#13;
                                                was extended to the new districts and municipality created in 2005 and 2009 to&#13;
                                                address weak government capacity, which was in part aggravated by regional splitting.&#13;
                                                In Aceh, programs were designed to avoid inducing or aggravating conflict, and in&#13;
                                                some cases programs were directed to highland regions that had been particularly&#13;
                                                neglected during the years of conflict. Support provided to the provincial level aimed&#13;
                                                to elaborate on an intergovernmental legal framework intended to operationalize the&#13;
                                                2005 Helsinki Peace Accord that ended the conflict in Aceh. Much more work remains&#13;
                                                to be done in fleshing out the regulatory framework that will underpin peace in Aceh&#13;
                                                for instance, or in gaining cooperation for an island development strategy in Nias.&#13;
&#13;
                                                The third layer in Figure 2 represents the longer term governance challenges faced not&#13;
                                                just by Aceh and Nias but common throughout most regions in Indonesia. During the&#13;
                                                reconstruction the MDF and development partners only touched upon and provided&#13;
                                                limited capacity building support to address these entrenched governance challenges.&#13;
                                                While these types of governance issues are beyond the mandate of most programs&#13;
                                                aimed at post-disaster reconstruction, they pose significant challenges to governance&#13;
                                                and development that can undermine the sustainability of the gains achieved&#13;
                                                during the reconstruction. Tackling these issues requires longer term commitments of&#13;
                                                multiple stakeholders.&#13;

The experience of development partners in Aceh and Nias suggests that it is important&#13;
to differentiate the capacity challenges being addressed in post-disaster settings.&#13;
Awareness of the various layers of capacity challenges, their implications and their&#13;
intervention requirements is paramount in designing a capacity building strategy.&#13;
In a post-disaster context, the primary focus should be on the capabilities needed&#13;
for populations and local governments to play an active and meaningful role in their&#13;
recovery and rebuilding. But attention must also be given to some of the particular&#13;
and pervasive challenges that predated the disaster. This can help safeguard the&#13;
investments made in social and physical infrastructure and prevent social and political&#13;
fragmentation, with its inevitable tensions. However, the latter investments must be&#13;
made carefully; the challenge is vast and the recovery effort is limited by both time&#13;
and resources. They may be better addressed under a different assistance track than&#13;
one premised on post-disaster recovery.&#13;

                    The MDF played a significant role in strengthening capacity in Aceh and Nias, injecting&#13;
                    explicit capacity building in most of its projects. The intensity of capacity building work&#13;
                    increased over the life of the MDF projects. The capacity building strategies ranged&#13;
                    from empowering communities to participate in the rebuilding of housing and local&#13;
                    infrastructure to strengthening skills and systems for local governments to manage&#13;
                    reconstruction assets and better address public sector management reform.&#13;
&#13;
                    The 15 development partners in the MDF funded 23 projects in six outcome areas,&#13;
                    with varying proportions of capacity building incorporated into each of the projects&#13;
                    (see Chart 1). The capacity building component for each project is shown with darker&#13;
                    shading. Capacity building activities embedded across all projects accounted for about&#13;
                    20 percent of the MDFâ&#128;&#153;s total funds of $655 million.1&#13;
&#13;
                    A wide range of actors have contributed to the capacity building successes of the MDF,&#13;

                    The MDF was governed by a Steering Committee, which consisted of national&#13;
                    and provincial government representatives, the World Bank, and donors. Other&#13;
                    stakeholders such as United Nations agencies, civil society, and the international NGO&#13;
                    community also participated as observers. The Steering Committee met on a regular&#13;
                    basis in Jakarta or Aceh to review and endorse proposals and discuss progress in&#13;
                    recovery in Aceh and North Sumatra.&#13;
&#13;
                    The majority of MDF projects were implemented through the Government of Indonesia&#13;
                    with funds passing through its budget. The remaining projects were implemented by&#13;
                    agencies in the United Nations system or by non-government organizations, both&#13;
                    national and international. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),&#13;

                                               The Tsunami Disaster Mitigation Research Center (TDMRC) was developed under MDFâ&#128;&#153;s       Photo:&#13;
                                               Disaster Risk Reduction project in Aceh with UDNP as the partner agency. The TDMRC is   TDMRC&#13;
                                               a resource center on disaster preparedness and research that shares information with    Project Team&#13;
                                               other disaster prone countries.&#13;

                                               the World Bank, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Food&#13;
                                               Programme (WFP) served as partner agencies for the projects, providing supervision&#13;
                                               and oversight, in partnership with national and local government. Further contracting&#13;
                                               for implementation was undertaken using international firms and NGOs, as well as&#13;
                                               local NGOs.&#13;

                                               BRR and Bappenas&#13;
&#13;
                                               The National Development Planning Agency, Bappenas, acted as a key national&#13;
                                               agency providing leadership and coordination for the recovery of Aceh and Nias. It&#13;
                                               was the driving force in establishing BRR as the one-stop agency for managing the&#13;
                                               reconstruction and rehabilitation effort. It led the preparation for the Master Plan of&#13;
                                               Regional Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (Presidential Regulation 47/2008). It was&#13;
                                               also the executing agency for several MDF-funded projects. Related line ministries&#13;
                                               including the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), the Ministry of Public Works (MPW),&#13;
                                               the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Disadvantaged Areas (MinDA), and the&#13;
                                               National Land Agency partnered with the MDF to implement or support the projects.&#13;

                                                                                                       Building Capacity:&#13;
             capacity in the medium term,2 up to five years, to:&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Increase the capacity of the local government apparatus and members of the&#13;
                legislative body in planning and financial management processes.&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Increase the capacity of local government apparatus in facing the threats of&#13;
                natural and non-natural disaster, through managerial technical training and the&#13;
                development of early detection system.&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Restore the local governance administration system responsive to unexpected&#13;
                changes (natural and non-natural disasters).&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Restore and restructure institutions and operational procedures in accordance&#13;
                with the main duties, functions, authorities and responsibilities, in order to meet&#13;
                minimum service standards.&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Establish and enhance inter-governmental coordination and cooperation.&#13;
&#13;
             The assumption embedded in this view of rehabilitation and reconstruction was a&#13;
             focus on returning to â&#128;&#156;normal.â&#128;&#157; But there was a suggestion that some â&#128;&#156;restructuringâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
             would be necessary to allow institutions to truly provide meaningful services. Some&#13;
             MDF projects sought to facilitate some measure of â&#128;&#156;restructuringâ&#128;&#157; or reform. Perhaps&#13;
             the most ambitious was the Aceh Government Transformation Programme (AGTP).&#13;
             These projects aimed to establish â&#128;&#156;governance, management and service-delivery&#13;
             systems which are designed to function long after project support ends.â&#128;&#157;3&#13;

             Provincial Governments of Aceh and North Sumatra&#13;
&#13;
             Several units of the Aceh government have played a role in the MDF-funded projects,&#13;
             among them Bappeda, Bappedalda, Agency for Personnel and Education/Training&#13;
             (BKPP), the Bureau for Legal Affairs, and the Bureau for Organizations. Additionally, a&#13;
             representative of the office of the Governor of Aceh was a member of the MDF project&#13;
             selection committee.&#13;
&#13;
             The main provincial unit involved in North Sumatra was Bappeda, which provided&#13;
             support to the districts and city governments of Nias from the provincial capital&#13;
             in Medan.&#13;
&#13;
             Some of the provincial units in Aceh and North Sumatra became the implementing&#13;
             agencies for MDF-funded projects, housing the relevant Project Management Unit (PMU).&#13;
             For instance, Bappeda Aceh was the implementing agency of the Economic Development&#13;
             Financing Facility (EDFF). Its role was largely to ensure that the EDFF supported the&#13;
             implementation of the Government of Acehâ&#128;&#153;s economic development strategy.&#13;

                                               (BKPP) supported by AGTP. The agency built a strong foundation to strengthen the        AGTP&#13;
                                               knowledge and skills required to develop Acehâ&#128;&#153;s civil service going forward.            Collection&#13;

&#13;
                                               The involvement of the provincial level was much more intensive in Aceh than North&#13;
                                               Sumatra. Several projects in Aceh, for example, involved provincial government units.&#13;
                                               The AGTP heavily involved the Legal Bureau, the Organizational Bureau, and the BKPP.&#13;
                                               In this case, the linkage to the provincial secretariat, with an assistant to the Governor&#13;
                                               given special responsibilities to guide the program, was expected to facilitate this cross&#13;
                                               unit approach.&#13;
&#13;
                                               Provincial and Local Goverments&#13;
&#13;
                                               The MDFâ&#128;&#153;s capacity building assistance targeted both provincial and local government&#13;
                                               levels, particularly for Aceh province. The AGTP, for instance, sought to add capacity&#13;
                                               to the provincial BKPP to in turn assist districts in their management of the recovery.&#13;
                                               In the case of the UNDP/ILO implemented project â&#128;&#156;Creating Jobs: Capacity Building for&#13;
                                               Local Resource-based Road Works in Selected Districts in Aceh and Nias,â&#128;&#157; (CBLR3) the&#13;
                                               focus was providing assistance to the four selected district governments.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                  41&#13;

             MDF-funded projects have offered several roles to actors outside of government. Civil&#13;
             Society Organizations and NGO representatives served on the MDF Steering Committee.&#13;
             Within projects, some CSOs and NGOs were used as implementing partners, as in the&#13;
             case of the CSO project and EDFF. Community-based organizations have been target&#13;
             groups for small-scale infrastructure and economic projects (e.g., KDP, SPADA, CSO&#13;
             project) and the target of awareness or educational campaigns (e.g., disaster risk&#13;
             management through DRR-A).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.2	 The MDFâ&#128;&#153;s Approach to Capacity Building&#13;
&#13;
             The MDF set out some broad principles to guide its capacity building efforts in its&#13;
             overall corporate policy,4 even though it did not construct an elaborate capacity&#13;
             building framework. It aimed to introduce good practices in post-disaster and post-&#13;
             conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction, drawing from international experiences.&#13;
             It pledged to be responsive to government needs, as articulated by the BRR. Where&#13;
             appropriate, it sought to strengthen government capacity by channeling funds on-&#13;
             budget. It promoted community based approaches, especially in the early days of&#13;
             the recovery, and emphasized social and environmental sustainability post-MDF. It&#13;
             recognized that it needed a short, medium and longer term view of capacity building,&#13;
             and that key actors would play important roles, the BRR, local government and civil&#13;
             society in particular.&#13;
&#13;
             Less explicitly, the MDF committed to including capacity building components in&#13;
             almost all projects. Notably, inserting capacity building components was seen as core&#13;
             to an exit strategy that would ensure sustainability. The term Capacity Building was&#13;
             not defined by the MDF, but some sub-project advisors differentiated this from the&#13;
             more recent term â&#128;&#156;capacity developmentâ&#128;&#157; (see Box 1).&#13;
&#13;
             MDF project interventions have underscored the importance of being active at three&#13;
             levelsâ&#128;&#148;individuals, organizations and systems. This conceptualization of capacity&#13;
             building, which has roots in the UNDPâ&#128;&#153;s experiences, is illustrated in Figure 3. Combining&#13;
             human resource development with the rebuilding of infrastructure was crucial to&#13;
             success in the early stages of recovery. Thinking critically about these possible levels&#13;
             was necessary to develop the right skills, procedures, structures, policies and legal&#13;
             frameworks appropriate to ensure long-term capacity enhancement.&#13;
&#13;
             Often, the levels of intervention must be linked, recognizing that investments in&#13;
             individual skills have more impact when organizational and systemic changes are&#13;
             also made.&#13;

                                                                                                    Building Capacity:&#13;
                   Box 1: Capacity Building in the Context of Post-Disaster Recovery&#13;
&#13;
                   The more common term in use today, capacity development, can be broadly&#13;
                   understood as â&#128;&#152;the process through which individuals, organizations and&#13;
                   societies obtain, strengthen and maintain the capabilities to set and achieve&#13;
                   their own development objectives over time.â&#128;&#153;&#13;
&#13;
                   In a post-disaster context the above capabilities include an institutional&#13;
                   framework for disaster risk reduction (DRR) that helps to mainstream DRR in&#13;
                   development planning, services, infrastructure, emergency preparedness, and&#13;
                   response and recovery.5&#13;
&#13;
                   MDF projects reveal a wide range of capacity building settings and approaches,&#13;
                   with instances of capacity replacement or substitution in early days and when&#13;
                   time was pressing and the focus was on a particular technical outcome. More&#13;
                   sophisticated and nationallyled governance enhancing efforts are evident&#13;
                   toward the end of the MDF life spanâ&#128;&#148;which better fit under the capacity&#13;
                   development label.&#13;

&#13;
                                               At the first level, capacity building interventions focused on orientation and training&#13;
                                               to individuals and community groups. An extensive effort was mounted early on to&#13;
                                               support these groups who were rebuilding homes and community infrastructure,&#13;
                                               increasing citizensâ&#128;&#153; voice in decisions on the location and type of construction. Citizens&#13;
                                               also participated in the physical construction process, leading to a sense of ownership&#13;
                                               of the resulting facilities, and increasing the likelihood of subsequent maintenance&#13;
                                               and effective operation.&#13;
&#13;
                                               Building capacity to respond to future disasters was deemed a critical interventionâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
                                               several MDF projects worked to enhance the capacity of relevant organizations in this&#13;
                                               area. Local government units, such as the Provincial Disaster Management Agency&#13;
                                               (BPBD) devoted to disaster management, were established. These projects employed&#13;
                                               new disaster planning approaches and linked them to a network of related government&#13;
                                               units and knowledge institutions. These new units are now engaged in a variety of&#13;
                                               community awareness, education, and mobilization efforts.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                  45&#13;

                                                                                                          Building Capacity:&#13;
                built in the reconstruction has also proven important. MDF assistance to government&#13;
                agencies in developing approaches and processes (e.g. verification and evaluation&#13;
                of assets) helped to find a proper home for the assets, after ensuring that the&#13;
                recipientsâ&#128;&#148;community groups and local government unitsâ&#128;&#148;had an appropriate&#13;
                asset management system and were willing to allocate the requisite operation and&#13;
                maintenance of funding.&#13;
&#13;
                Moving beyond individual skills and organizational development, deeper governance&#13;
                challenges require support for systems improvements at the highest level on the&#13;
                capacity building hierarchy. The legacy of conflict in Aceh and long-term neglect in&#13;
                Nias resulted in political, administrative and societal dynamics that held back the&#13;
                performance of the respective local governments.6 A group of MDF projects was&#13;
                oriented specifically to address these more fundamental governance challenges&#13;
                through support to legal and judicial frameworks. Considered together as a whole,&#13;
                MDF interventions at all three levels have been instrumental in raising the capacity of&#13;
                communities, civil society, and local government units in Aceh and Nias.&#13;

                                                                                                                 Building Capacity:&#13;
                    The MDF was established several months after the natural disasters, following&#13;
                    the immediate emergency response. It was created to facilitate coordination of&#13;
                    international donor support. The MDFâ&#128;&#153;s governance structure and mandate made it&#13;
                    responsive to the Indonesian government policies and needs, and put it n a position to&#13;
                    â&#128;&#156;fill gapsâ&#128;&#157; as identified by the Government. With grant funds of $655 million, the MDF&#13;
                    comprised about 10 percent of the total external resources pledged.&#13;
&#13;
                    Early in the rehabilitation phase, the BRR became active and influential, providing MDF&#13;
                    and other donor vehicles with plans and requests to guide programmingÂ­         â&#128;&#148;ranging&#13;
                    from infrastructure development to capacity building support for the BRR itself. The&#13;
                    MDF initiated sub-projects or adapted existing projects to respond to these needs. In&#13;
                    many cases, it extended and modified projectsâ&#128;&#148;37 such extensions were seen for the&#13;
                    23 projects.&#13;
&#13;
                    The responsive nature of the MDF resulted in a wide range of projects and a loosely-&#13;
                    defined capacity building framework. In view of its mandate, the MDF did not develop&#13;
                    a more detailed approach to capacity building beyond the broad principles of its&#13;
                    recovery assistance policy. The responsive/gap filling stance resulted in a portfolio that&#13;
                    eventually covered all of the six broad outcome areas of the MDF (Chart 1). These&#13;
                    were, in a general way, consistent with the policies of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s 2005-2009&#13;
                    Action Plan (RENAKSI).1&#13;
&#13;
                    Not having a well-defined capacity building framework meant that the MDF was&#13;
                    not able to infuse projects with similar capacity building approaches, or to create&#13;
                    links between projects. Nor was it able to insist that its partner and implementing&#13;
                    agencies adopt set capacity building methodologies or apply a certain rigor to capacity&#13;
                    building efforts.&#13;

                                                                The MDF recognized the need for a more intensive treatment of capacity building&#13;
                                                                as the recovery proceeded. Given its responsive nature, the MDF portfolio mirrored&#13;

                                                                through government-implemented community driven development (CDD). This was&#13;
                                                                followed by a focus on infrastructure reconstruction. Economic development was a&#13;
                                                                later focus. The MDF sees its portfolio development as consisting of three phases as&#13;
                                                                shown in Figure 4.&#13;

                                                                As Figure 4 illustrates, the MDF focused on urgent needs initially, but was aware of&#13;
                                                                the need to shift to more complex investments over timeâ&#128;&#148;those requiring capacity&#13;

                                                                that â&#128;&#156;Physical implementation is finishing up, and the last set of projects focus&#13;

      is suggestive of the pervasiveness of capacity building across the MDF portfolio.&#13;
      	&#13;
      The more capacity building intensive and sophisticated projects came near the end&#13;
      of the MDFâ&#128;&#153;s life. The capacity building content of the MDF portfolio reflected the&#13;
      nature of the projects and their position within the recovery period, i.e., the three&#13;
      MDF phases. While capacity building was not an explicit or major part of the project&#13;
      design in many of the early projects, over time, it became a more visible and important&#13;
      component in some of these projects as they were monitored, extended or redesigned&#13;
      as new phases. New projects focused heavily on capacity building, and addressed&#13;
      deeper issues of governance, such as asset management, civil service management,&#13;
      and legal frameworks for the governance of Aceh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.3	 The MDFâ&#128;&#153;s Capacity Building Accomplishments&#13;
&#13;
      MDF projects had an enormous reach in Aceh and Nias, touching the lives of hundreds&#13;
      of thousands, giving them the means to rebuild, assert claims, and pursue livelihoods.&#13;
      Orientations, social mobilization, and facilitation were key interventions in bringing&#13;
      about this achievement, captured by some figures below:&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Nearly 290,000 participants in the community planning process, one-third of which&#13;
         were women.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 220,000 land certificates distributed. Of these, almost 30 percent were issued in the&#13;
         names of women or as joint titles.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 More than 73,000 households sustainably recovering waste.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Regular community participation in joint monitoring of forests in 74 villages and 15&#13;
         mukim (traditional village groupings).&#13;
&#13;
      Skills for individual and collective pursuits were strengthened. More targeted capacity&#13;
      building efforts came in the form of training tailored to specific target groups,&#13;
      encompassing civil society, the private sector, and government:&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Nearly 5,000 government officers trained in land administration, community&#13;
         driven adjudication, local employment creating road construction, municipal and&#13;
         community-based solid waste management, bottom-up planning processes, forest&#13;
         conservation, judicial services, and status monitoring. Over 1,000 government staff&#13;
         were also trained in solid waste management.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Over 32,000 students trained in waste management awareness and 286 teachers&#13;
         and students trained in recycling and benefits of solid waste management&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Nearly 11,000 teachers trained, including 1,000 in conservation awareness.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Over 14,000 local contractors trained in local resource based approach to road&#13;
         maintenance and construction.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Over 100,000 CSO and CBO participants/members trained in key strategic&#13;
         competence, organizational development, project management, community land&#13;
         mapping, community-driven adjudication, forest monitoring, judicial services, legal&#13;
         education and conflict resolution.&#13;
&amp;#12;       50&#13;
                                                          A great deal of the capacity building efforts had a strong collective focus, bringing&#13;

                                                          In the early days of the recovery, MDF projects lacked well articulated capacity building&#13;
                                                          components and sometimes relied on capacity replacement/substitution. Early in the&#13;
                                                          recovery process, several urgent projects were launched under the MDF related to&#13;
                                                          housing and other basic service infrastructure. These projects did not clearly articulate&#13;
                                                          a capacity building component, and in cases appeared to have none at all. The emphasis&#13;

All of the MDFâ&#128;&#153;s community driven projects made provisions for including womenâ&#128;&#153;s   Photo:&#13;
voices in community planning for reconstruction.                                   Sabine&#13;
                                                                                   Joukes&#13;
&#13;
was on generating usable local plans, restoring services or building infrastructure. The&#13;
rebuilding of ports (TRPRP) and shipping of emergency and rebuilding materials (SDLP-&#13;
initial phase) are the two notable projects of this kind.&#13;
&#13;
Capacity gaps met in a recovery setting cannot, and need not, always be addressed&#13;
in the ideal way (driven locally and enhancing existing capacities). Sometimes it is&#13;
important to just get the job done. Overcoming these capacity gaps is an urgent matter,&#13;
justifying the use of technical assistance that is task or product oriented. International&#13;
advisors placed in the BRR through the MDF can be seen in this light. The key was to&#13;
respond swiftly to the organizational requirements of the BRR, allowing it in turn to&#13;
play a vital coordinating role in the overall recovery.&#13;
&#13;
As infrastructure was built, attention turned to enhancing provincial and local&#13;
government capacity to accept and manage assets. The initial push to restore basic&#13;
physical infrastructure did not emphasize identifying the specific level of government&#13;
that would need to manage the infrastructure in the long term. Over time, as the&#13;
staff was restored and training was provided, local government became more involved&#13;
in the planning of infrastructure. Implementing partners managing the building of&#13;
infrastructure sought to clarify who would ultimately be managing the infrastructure&#13;
assets, and designed capacity building to enable local actors to accept and continue&#13;
the operation of built infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
In the case of the two rural roads projects implemented by the ILO, it was assumed&#13;
that the districts would exert ownership over the small roads produced. However, the&#13;
districts have been reluctant to take up the small roads onto their asset registers as the&#13;

                                                   legal framework on functional assignment did not explicitly give them jurisdiction over&#13;

                                                   In the case of Banda Aceh Flood Mitigation Project (BAFM), the implementing agency,&#13;
                                                   Muslim Aid, spent eight percent of the project costs (about $500,000) to train the&#13;
                                                   relevant municipal government unit of the City of Banda Aceh to eventually manage&#13;

                                                   MDF was also drawn into support for processing the handover of new assets, using the&#13;
                                                   multi-purpose governance projects AGTP and NITP. These efforts focused on handover&#13;
                                                   of assets created under the MDF and other assets built with funds channeled through&#13;
                                                   the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s budget&#13;
&#13;
                                                   Even with the support given by AGTP/NITP, the issue of asset handover and maintenance&#13;
                                                   remains a challenge for many assets produced through the reconstruction. Assets&#13;
                                                   created under MDF funding have been handed over to the relevant authorities, but&#13;
                                                   for many of the assets created through the NGOs and other donors that did not&#13;
                                                   pass through the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s budget, the issue of ownership and responsibility for&#13;
                                                   continued operations and maintenance may prove difficult. This potentially endangers&#13;
                                                   the sustainability of expected benefits.&#13;
&#13;
                                                   MDF recognized the need to address the challenge of institutionalizing good practice.&#13;
                                                   As projects neared their completion, greater attention was given to capacity building.&#13;
                                                   Some projects transformed themselves over time from infrastructure or logistics&#13;
                                                   efforts to essentially capacity building projects that sought to institutionalize good&#13;
                                                   practices. This can be seen in the case of the waste management program under the&#13;
                                                   TRWMP, the rural roads projects of ILOâ&#128;&#153;s CBLR3, and the port management and disaster&#13;
                                                   preparedness activities of SDLP. The capacity building activities incorporated into the&#13;
                                                   projects enabled the agencies being supported to take up management practices&#13;
                                                   promoted by the project. As closing dates approached, implementing agencies&#13;
                                                   increasingly targeted specific local actors who would determine the sustainability of&#13;
                                                   project outcomes. Even so, project staff often voiced the hope for project extensions&#13;
                                                   in order to assure confidence in capacity to anchor new approaches or innovations.&#13;
&#13;
                                                   Over time the MDF found itself drawn into addressing difficult governance challenges,&#13;
                                                   requiring support that aimed higher on the capacity building hierarchy. Deeper&#13;
                                                   governance challengesâ&#128;&#148;the legacy of conflict in Aceh and of relative neglect in&#13;
                                                   Niasâ&#128;&#148;are sources of political, administrative and societal dynamics that hold back&#13;
                                                   the performance of provincial and local government. Commitment to tackle these&#13;
                                                   challenges derives from national level strategies, but also from local government&#13;
                                                   priorities, as found for instance in the Aceh Recovery Framework (ARF) 2008-2011,&#13;
                                                   which highlights a related cluster of priorities: the Rule of Law, Good Governance&#13;
                                                   and Democratic Decentralization. Some MDF projects were oriented to these more&#13;
                                                   fundamental governance challenges (AGTP, NITP, DRR-A, LEDP, CBLR3/RACBP), and&#13;
                                                   they have faced great difficulties in achieving their objectives in the given time frames&#13;

(see Figure 3), seeking organizational and system changes. Some notable examples are&#13;
captured in Box 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Box 2: Addressing Governance Challenges at Provincial Level&#13;
&#13;
   Notable examples of efforts to address deep governance challenges at the&#13;
   provincial level in Aceh through the AGTP are:&#13;
&#13;
   Applying a â&#128;&#156;fit and proper testâ&#128;&#157; in provincial government recruitment:&#13;
   Supported by the AGTP, and drawing on the resources of policy experts from&#13;
   Indonesia, the UK and Malaysia, the former Governor of Aceh â&#128;&#156;made an&#13;
   historical recruitment choiceâ&#128;&#157; in applying a â&#128;&#152;fit and proper testâ&#128;&#153; to select the&#13;
   42 heads of provincial units in a fair and transparent manner. The initiative was&#13;
   part of a larger effort to reform the provincial government. The 52 units were&#13;
   reduced to 42, and the new heads were asked to sign an integrity pact. A public&#13;
   announcement was also made by the former Governor of his commitment to&#13;
   change underperforming provincial heads.&#13;
&#13;
   Accelerating the implementation of the provincial budget: AGTP briefly&#13;
   supported the establishment of a special unit in the Governorâ&#128;&#153;s Office, the&#13;
   P2K-APBA, to overcome the chronically poor budget absorption. This effort&#13;
   quickly gained momentum and became self-propelled, spurred by the strong&#13;
   political support and sense of urgency imparted by then-Governor Irwandi.&#13;
   Drawing from the experience and drive of a senior member of the BRR after it&#13;
   closed, the unit was able to adapt BRR software to track the provincial budget&#13;
   and to organize the budget monitoring and corrective activities to focus on&#13;
   those projects facing implementation problems. The unitâ&#128;&#153;s work allowed the&#13;
   provincial government to improve its budget absorption rate from 64 percent&#13;
   in 2009 to over 90 percent by 2010/2011.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Governance reform support can pay off, but implies risk and political commitment,&#13;
and requires time and well-designed efforts. MDF projects supporting governance&#13;
reforms proved to be difficult, facing considerable risk arising from political, policy and&#13;
organizational dynamics. MDF projects have in cases taken on these risks, committing&#13;
to ambitious outcomes. The examples provided in Box 2 show that governance support&#13;
can have a significant payoff, locally and nationally. The fit and proper test effort has&#13;
inspired districts in Aceh to follow suit, and has added momentum across Indonesia for&#13;
this approach. Financial staff of other provincial governments (Gorontalo for instance)&#13;
have visited Aceh to learn of the budget implementation approach of the P2K-APBA.&#13;
&#13;
National and international experience suggest that tackling these fundamental&#13;
governance challenges requires political commitment from the beginning as they&#13;
relate to long standing systemic issues (those at the bottom layer of Figure 2). To&#13;
&amp;#12;       54&#13;
                                                          have any hope of success, the efforts should be based on some existing capacity and&#13;

                                                          this needs to be well designed, sufficiently resourced, flexible, and operating with a 5&#13;

                                                          Disaster risk reduction was mainstreamed in the MDF portfolio. The MDF played a&#13;
                                                          helpful role in facilitating the merging of several funding proposals into the Making&#13;

                                                          assisted a wide range of DRR activities, from developing a legal framework for DRR&#13;
                                                          to raising community awareness and capacity to respond to disasters. Other capacity&#13;
                                                          development projects also made a contribution to DRR, among them the NITP in Nias,&#13;
                                                          one of its outcomes being the integration of DRR into provincial/local government&#13;

government disaster management agencies (BPBA/BPBDs) to enable a quicker and&#13;
more effective response to disasters.&#13;
&#13;
New institutions focused on DRR were assisted. The project DRR-A engaged in&#13;
institution building on several fronts, facilitating the establishment of multi-stakeholder&#13;
forums, the regulatory framework for the Provincial Disaster Management Agency&#13;
(BPBA) disaster management plans for district level agencies, (BPBDs), and the birth of&#13;
the Tsunami Disaster Mitigation Research Center (TDMRC) to be a source of science-&#13;
based technical expertise and knowledge products on DRR. The TDMRC, with the&#13;
University of Syiah Kuala and DRR-A assistance, initiated a Masterâ&#128;&#153;s degree program&#13;
on Disaster Science.&#13;
&#13;
Several MDF projects have contributed to enabling citizens and communities&#13;
to make proper preparations and good choices following a disaster alert. For&#13;
instance, the DRR-A assisted TDMRC to develop inputs to be used in school&#13;
curriculum materials and public awareness activities. Much has been learned in&#13;
the process, such as the need to have a good communication link from village to&#13;
district level.&#13;

                    There are no set standards to assess post-disaster capacity building, but some emerging&#13;
                    good practices on capacity building and post-disaster support can be helpful guides.&#13;

                                                                                                               Building Capacity:&#13;
                    The literature on post-disaster recovery is still developing, but several good practices&#13;
                    are discernible at this time that can be compared to the MDF experience of capacity&#13;
                    building efforts in Aceh and Nias. Beyond these, it is necessary to revert to the longer&#13;
                    standing good practices that are found in the wider capacity building literature. The&#13;
                    MDF experience will be examined therefore against the following areas that contain&#13;
                    emerging good practices:&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	 Post-disaster recovery approach&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	 Capacity building conceptualization and methodology&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
       4.1	 MDFâ&#128;&#153;s Approach to Post-Disaster Recovery&#13;
                    The MDF sought to be responsive and consistent with the â&#128;&#152;build back betterâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
                    approachâ&#128;&#148;a realistic aim in view of resources made available. MDF aimed for&#13;
                    donor coordination, and to be responsive to government. Both the coordination and&#13;
                    responsiveness aims are in keeping with the donor aid principles that have been well&#13;
                    articulated over the last decade.&#13;
&#13;
                    The rebuilding cost in a â&#128;&#156;build back betterâ&#128;&#157; scenario was matched with Government&#13;
                    of Indonesia and external resources. This may not always be the case in a post-&#13;
                    disaster situation, for any number of reasons, such as donor fatigue and geopolitical&#13;
                    considerations. Already the discourse has shifted slightly, as seen in Pakistan and&#13;
                    Christchurch (New Zealand) following recent earthquakes where the term â&#128;&#156;build back&#13;
                    smarterâ&#128;&#153; has been adopted,1 indicating that after some disasters the notion of â&#128;&#152;right-&#13;
                    sizingâ&#128;&#153; or doing things differently may be more appropriate than building back better,&#13;
                    with its connotations of greater scale and technological sophistication.&#13;
&#13;
                    The sometimes implicit aim to address governance issues within the â&#128;&#152;build back betterâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
                    approach is something new. The post-recovery literature does not speak directly to&#13;
                    this dimension of the recovery, although it does indicate that there is some tension&#13;
                    in responding to urgent needs in any way possible and developing local capacity to&#13;
                    manage the recovery and further development.&#13;

             â&#128;¢	 The vast majority of the 23 MDF projects had significant capacity building&#13;
                components. The formulation of the capacity building components of MDF projects&#13;
                was not always rigorous, but as the projects matured, were extended, or given a&#13;
                new phase, the capacity building components were made more elaborate and in&#13;
                keeping with desired project outcomes.&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Weak capacity building frameworks of the projects undermined the tracking of&#13;
                achievements, nevertheless some monitoring and evaluation activities proved&#13;
                valuable. The capacity building components tended to lack clear outcomes and&#13;
                sufficient baselines and indicators to adequately track progress beyond immediate&#13;
                outputs. Nonetheless, several projects benefitted greatly from intensive field&#13;
                monitoring visits and from mid-term reviews/evaluations.&#13;
&#13;
             Additional aspects of MDF project capacity building efforts worth noting are those&#13;
             specific to the post-disaster scene:&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Capacity building was viewed through the lens of post-disaster recovery. The&#13;
                MDF effort reflects the internationally acknowledged view that â&#128;&#156;capacity&#13;
                development is a central strategy for reducing risk.â&#128;&#157;2 This realization grew over&#13;
                time. By the closing of the MDF, 20 percent of its $655 million had been spent on&#13;
                capacity building activities.&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 MDF projects appreciated capacity building nuances. Capacity building and capacity&#13;
                development were terms used interchangeably, but the specific approaches in the&#13;
                projects reveal a commitment to recognizing and enhancing existing capacities.&#13;

       In a disaster recovery context, with many different partners and implementers, a&#13;
       pragmatic approach that allows a mix of modalities for the flow of funds may result in&#13;
       a more comprehensive program of support.&#13;

4.4	Sustainability&#13;
       The limited official recovery period created challenges for sustainability of project&#13;
       benefits. The short time horizon was difficult to reconcile with the desire to see a&#13;
       continuation of programs or good practices and with a commitment to ensure an&#13;
       equitable distribution and diffusion of benefits throughout Aceh and Nias.&#13;
&amp;#12;62&#13;
                                                       One of the project design strategies used by the MDF offered the possibility of program&#13;
Chapter 4 - The MDFâ&#128;&#153;s Contributions to Good Practice&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       sustainability: MDF supported existing national programs that were not yet offering&#13;
                                                       wide coverage in the disaster-affected areas. Hence, the Kecamatan Development&#13;
                                                       Project (KDP) and the Urban Poverty Project (UPP) were funded to extend their reach&#13;
                                                       in Aceh and Nias. This strategy made use of existing capacity in the form of program&#13;
                                                       structures and government and stakeholder familiarity with the objectives and&#13;
                                                       approach of the programs. In this approach, the MDF hoped to lessen the risks of delays&#13;
                                                       in project preparation and initiation, and increase the likelihood that the programs&#13;
                                                       would be continued after the recovery period. These objectives were achieved, but not&#13;
                                                       without challenges: for instance, the difficulty in attracting enough good facilitators,&#13;
                                                       and the tenuous links to the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s regular bottom-up planning system. These&#13;
                                                       limitations could have been reduced by careful redesign, but that would have taken&#13;
                                                       time, detracting from the appeal of using these â&#128;&#152;ready-madeâ&#128;&#153; vehicles.&#13;
&#13;
                                                       As programs neared their closing dates, more attention was given to exit strategies and&#13;
                                                       sustainability. For entirely new projects, the challenge lay in embedding new practices&#13;
                                                       in the proper institutional matrix before the closing date. This end of project state often&#13;
                                                       became an urgent consideration toward the end of individual projects, particularly for&#13;
                                                       infrastructure. For ongoing projects, retrofitting to improve performance in capacity&#13;
                                                       development was not always possible or came too late to ensure sustainability. The&#13;
                                                       drive for visible achievements sometimes obscured what were often meant to be&#13;
                                                       demonstrations of practices that were to be embedded and expanded by local actors&#13;
                                                       following project closing.&#13;
&#13;
                                                       Several projects found themselves in this sustainability bind. Exit strategies are&#13;
                                                       informed by the need to ensure government and community players are ready and&#13;
                                                       able to incorporate assets and forward action, while sustainability strategies aim at&#13;
                                                       the successful continuation of the expected stream of benefits. Both strategies are&#13;
                                                       achieved in their own time, and ideally should be incorporated within the fabric of the&#13;
                                                       project rather than grafted onto the project near the end of its life.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  63&#13;

complex or governance related projects. Weaving exit and sustainability strategies into&#13;
projects requires understanding the institutional context. Institutional analysis was&#13;
not part of most of the projects in the MDF portfolio, but should have been, a message&#13;
repeated in several of the project reviews/evaluations. Without a strong institutional&#13;
analysis with an established baseline, many projects lacked specific intervention&#13;
design, indicators to track progress, and reporting/corrective action.&#13;
&#13;
Institutional analysis that is useful in designing capacity development (or any kind of&#13;
investment) needs to deal with the small scale organizational/individual concerns as&#13;
well as the macro level, understanding for instance the decentralized intergovernmental&#13;
division of labor (who does what at what level of government) and the availability&#13;
or rigidity in financing mechanisms that development partners can use (or avoid) in&#13;
channeling their financial support. Some of these features became familiar to MDF&#13;
projects (and MDF as an organization) as the recovery assistance unfolded, but the&#13;
learning was rather painful at times and misunderstandings and delays affected project&#13;
implementation, ultimately reducing project results.&#13;

                                                                                                               Building Capacity:&#13;
                    The capacity building experience of the MDF holds lessons regarding factors that&#13;
                    favor success, as well as those that limit it. For government and supporting actors, the&#13;
                    experiences provide the following lessons:&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	 â&#128;&#152;Build back betterâ&#128;&#153; is a powerful rallying call, where sufficient resources are made&#13;
                       available to match the commitment, as was the case in Aceh and Nias.&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	 Even when resources for the recovery are considerable, care must nonetheless be&#13;
                       taken to delineate the scope of â&#128;&#152;build back betterâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#148;whether it should go deeper&#13;
                       than visible replacement/enhancement of physical infrastructure to encompass&#13;
                       core governance capacities.&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	 Recovery efforts will inevitably be drawn into addressing difficult and long-standing&#13;
                       governance challenges, some of which will determine the sustainability of recovery&#13;
                       investmentsâ&#128;&#148;if external capacity building is provided, it should be with a full&#13;
                       awareness that success is predicated on political commitment, sufficient time, and&#13;
                       well-designed interventions that use appropriate entry levels of capacity building.&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	 Capacity building efforts to embed good practices introduced in the recovery will&#13;
                       tend to be pressed for time in the context of an officially set recovery period;&#13;
                       a decision may be put to government and development partners to address&#13;
                       important capacity needs through the platforms and time-frame of the â&#128;&#156;recoveryâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
                       or alternatively to use separate and possibly more suitable tracks.&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	 The use of a powerful coordinating central government agency (for example, BRR in&#13;
                       Aceh and Nias) can be helpful in guiding the recovery effort, but must have a built-&#13;
                       in turnover plan to sub-national government (beyond the transfer of assets), and&#13;
                       therefore a more explicit and intensive capacity building policy and programming&#13;
                       for sub-national government.&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	 In a recovery context, the pressure to get the job doneâ&#128;&#148;with ad hoc approaches,&#13;
                       often relying on capacity substitutionâ&#128;&#148;will always be in tension with the desire to&#13;
                       apply more rigorous and endogenous capacity building approaches that emphasize&#13;
                       sustainability. A â&#128;&#152;pragmaticâ&#128;&#153; approach in early days needs to evolve toward a more&#13;
                       rigorous approach over time, and a minimum level of capacity building assessment&#13;
                       and design must be done from the beginning of a recovery effort.&#13;

5.2 	Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
      A great deal has been achieved in the recovery of Aceh and Nias. These regions&#13;
      have been built back better in many respects. The support provided by development&#13;
      partners had much to do with the success, and the capacity building components of&#13;
      the projects were critical to the impact and sustainability of the recovery and the&#13;
      efforts to address longer term governance challenges. The MDF made a significant&#13;
      contribution to this overall effort and achievement, validating its overall model.&#13;

                                                              The MDF launched into its work with a commitment to be responsive to government,&#13;
                                                              and with the mindset of â&#128;&#152;getting the job doneâ&#128;&#153;. It showed an evolution over time&#13;
                                                              in its capacity building approaches, with a greater emphasis on governance and&#13;

                                                              for a more intensive and coherent approach to capacity building in its portfolio,&#13;
                                                              assisting the government to forge a more explicit capacity building approach for the&#13;
                                                              recovery as a whole. A pragmatic approach to capacity building in the early days of&#13;
                                                              recovery needs to evolve toward a more rigorous approach over time, and a minimum&#13;

                                                              a recovery effort.&#13;

The MDF experience underscores that capacity building in a recovery context needs&#13;

                                                                                           Building Capacity:&#13;
to be nuanced, making room for diverse approaches. While capacity building may&#13;
not be the focus in early emergency/recovery efforts, it should be seen as critical to&#13;
getting the most from later recovery activities, where local resource mobilization and&#13;
ownership is paramount. Well-designed capacity building is important to addressing&#13;
longer term governance challenges. In this respect, difficult decisions will be needed&#13;
to determine how extensive support should be for tackling deep rooted and pervasive&#13;
governance challenges that inevitably surface in a recovery effort. Whether these will&#13;
severely impinge on the sustainability of the recovery investments is one consideration.&#13;
Another is whether it may be more appropriate to tackle these issues on a separate&#13;
track (from that of the official recovery effort).&#13;
&#13;
In Aceh and Nias, the end of the reconstruction presents an opportunity to take&#13;
stock of progress and remaining capacity gaps. Capacity challenges in Aceh and Nias&#13;
remain, and the newly enhanced capacity will be tested in the future from challenges&#13;
such as further natural disasters and the demands for accelerated development.&#13;
Many of the challenges have to do with good governance. Aceh and Nias have emerged&#13;
from the reconstruction experience in a better position to address these challenges as&#13;
a result of the capacity building achieved through the recovery process.&#13;

            Building capacity : experiences from
            post-disaster Aceh and Nias
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias
            (MDF) and the Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF) have played
            significant roles in the remarkable recovery of Aceh, Nias
            and Java, following some of the worst disasters in Indonesia
            in recent years. The MDF and the JRF, which is patterned
            after it, are each considered a highly successful model for
            post-disaster reconstruction. This paper discusses the value
            of a phased approach to post-disaster reconstruction as a
            successful means to manage short-term expectations while
            delivering long-lasting, results of high quality. The
            natural disasters of late 2004 and early 2005 left a trail
            of human loss and destruction in Aceh and Nias. In such a
            scenario, capacity building efforts related to individual
            and community level investments yielded large returns. Aceh
            and Nias have emerged from the reconstruction experience in
            a better position to address these challenges as a result of
            the capacity building achieved through the recovery process.
