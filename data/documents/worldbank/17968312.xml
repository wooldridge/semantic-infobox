                        Aldewereld, Siem/Simon&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interview conducted by Dr. Robert W. Oliver, California Institute of&#13;
Technology, on 1985-11-06&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In Aldewereld's recollections approximately 25 years after the&#13;
events he describes the Bank's relations with India under both the&#13;
Black and Woods Regimes, and in detail the first development loan, the&#13;
Kans Grass project, made around 1950, in the amount of about $5&#13;
million and designed specifically to increase the productivity of&#13;
Indian agriculture. In illustrating the Bank's eagerness to help India&#13;
he cites financing the following projects: the activities of the&#13;
Damodar Valley Corporation (D.V.C.); the Indian Railways; Air India;&#13;
and the Indian telecommunications.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The Indus River Basin Project was part of Aldewereld's&#13;
operational responsibility for close to twelve years; having been&#13;
mostly involved in the latter phase. According to Aldewereld, Black's&#13;
decision to involve the Bank in solving the water dispute between&#13;
Pakistan and India culminated in the successful establishment of the&#13;
international water treaty with one of its main features of&#13;
"established use". Eugene Black successfully raising funds for the&#13;
Indus Basin Project consisting of a combination of loans and grants&#13;
and, around '62, asking Aldewereld to take over and add the&#13;
supervision of disbursement and "end-use" of the Indus Basin Project&#13;
to his duties as Director of Projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Aldewereld overseeing the timely and successful completion of the&#13;
construction of both the Tarbela and Mangla Dams. This, in addition to&#13;
his work on the Damodar Valley Project in India; the Niger Dam Project&#13;
in Nigeria; the Roseires Dam Project in the Sudan; the Miguel Aleman&#13;
&amp;#12;Power System in Mexico; and the Highway and Railway Projects in&#13;
Columbia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Aldewereld discusses the Bank's early relations with Japan,&#13;
Black's efforts in 1947 in ensuring the Bank's access to markets&#13;
outside the U.S., the Bank's expansion of its borrowing operations&#13;
world wide in 1952, his responsibilities in supervising what is called&#13;
the "end-use" of projects, and the set up of project evaluation. He&#13;
gives an overall summation of the Woods presidency, talks of Meyer's&#13;
appointments first President in 1946, his rationale for Meyer's early&#13;
resignation in mid December '46 followed soon thereafter in January&#13;
'47 by the death of vice president Harold Smith, thus marking what is&#13;
commonly referred to in the Bank as the "Interregnum". Chester Mclain,&#13;
the Bank's first General Counsel, and his efforts in continuing the&#13;
Bank's business. The "Interregnum" ending on March 17, 1947 when John&#13;
J. McCloy assumed office as second President, bringing along Robert&#13;
Garner as second Vice President, and Eugene Black who succeeded&#13;
Collado as the Bank's Executive Director for the U.S. In May 1947, the&#13;
Bank's first loan to France in the amount of $250 million. Shortly&#13;
thereafter, the Bank launching its first bond issue ever in the&#13;
American capital market, also in the amount of $250 million. And,&#13;
Aldewereld noting that the jurisdictional issue concerning the&#13;
relationship between Board and Management was never raised again--at&#13;
least covering the period until his retirement in July 1974.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In conclusion, Alderwereld mentions the meetings conducted under&#13;
Black, from time to time, outside Washington. Woods continuing the&#13;
practice and establishing the President's Council with its members&#13;
considering themselves essentially vice presidents. McNamara&#13;
continuing these regular meetings with senior staff after Woods'&#13;
retirement, where the increase in the number of people was not,&#13;
according to Aldewereld, matched by an increase in efficiency.&#13;
