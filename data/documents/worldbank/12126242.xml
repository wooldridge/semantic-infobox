The Little Green Data Book 2008 is based on World Development Indicators&#13;
2008 and its accompanying CD-ROM. Defining, gathering, and disseminating&#13;
international statistics is a collective effort of many people and organizations.&#13;
The indicators presented in World Development Indicators are the fruit of&#13;
decades of work at many levels, from the field workers who administer&#13;
censuses and household surveys to the committees and working parties&#13;
of the national and international statistical agencies that develop the&#13;
nomenclature, classifications, and standards fundamental to the international&#13;
statistical system. Nongovernmental organizations have also made important&#13;
contributions. We are indebted to the World Development Indicators partners,&#13;
as detailed in World Development Indicators 2008. The financial assistance&#13;
of the Government of Sweden is also gratefully acknowledged.&#13;
&#13;
The Little Green Data Book 2008 is the result of close collaboration between&#13;
the staff of the Development Data Group of the Development Economics&#13;
Vice Presidency and the Environment Department. Mehdi Akhlaghi, Richard&#13;
Fix, Kirk Hamilton, Saeed Ordoubadi, Beatriz Prieto-Oramas, Giovanni Ruta,&#13;
Alexandra Sears, and Jana Stoever contributed to its preparation. Meta de&#13;
Coquereaumont, Christopher Trott, and Elaine Wilson of Communications&#13;
Development provided design, editing, and layout. Staff from External Affairs&#13;
oversaw publication and distribution of the book.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                   Foreword&#13;
Welcome to The Little Green Data Book 2008. As in the 2007 edition, this&#13;
year's edition includes a Focus section, four introductory pages that focus on a&#13;
specific issue related to development and the environment. This year the focus&#13;
is on the damage from climate change and carbon dioxide emissions.&#13;
&#13;
Climate change continues to dominate public discourse about the environment.&#13;
Following on the strong interest stirred by the Stern Review on the Economics&#13;
of Climate Change in 2006, the Fourth Assessment Report of the Inter-&#13;
Governmental Panel on Climate Change has codified the firm scientific&#13;
consensus on the extent of human-induced climate change. Another important&#13;
milestone was the December 2007 United Nations Framework Convention on&#13;
Climate Change conference in Bali, which culminated in the adoption of the&#13;
Bali Roadmap, establishing four pillars--mitigation, adaptation, technology,&#13;
and finance--for negotiating a post-2012 climate pact.&#13;
&#13;
As this Focus shows, global warming can have negative effects on agriculture,&#13;
health, infrastructure, and other economic activities --effects that are likely&#13;
to hit developing countries the hardest. While high-income countries emit&#13;
more carbon dioxide than developing countries, emissions from developing&#13;
countries are growing at a faster pace. And emissions per capita in high-&#13;
income countries are still five times higher than in developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
The Little Green Data Book 2008 is a collaboration between the Development&#13;
Data Group of the Development Economics Vice Presidency and the&#13;
Environment Department of the World Bank. We welcome your suggestions&#13;
for how to improve future editions and make them more useful.&#13;

Climate change effects on agricultural productivity&#13;
&#13;
Global warming is predicted to reduce worldwide agricultural productivity more&#13;
than 15 percent by the 2080s. The effect will be more severe for developing&#13;
countries than for developed countries, partly for geographic reasons. The&#13;
predicted effect becomes positive for developed countries when carbon&#13;
fertilization effects are taken into account.&#13;

Climate change effects on health&#13;
&#13;
The largest health impacts of climate change are on malnutrition and are&#13;
linked to declining agricultural yields. While the effects are felt in South East&#13;
Asia through malnutrition and diarrhea, the impact on Africa is expected to&#13;
be dominated by increased incidence of malaria.&#13;

&amp;#12;Climate change effects due to rise in sea level&#13;
&#13;
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts a 1 meter rise&#13;
in sea level over the next hundred years linked to climate change (barring&#13;
catastrophic events, such as the melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet).&#13;
The effects are most severe in the Middle East and North Africa and East&#13;
Asia and Pacific for virtually all dimensions measured.&#13;

 storms between 1960 and 2002. People killed are given a weight of 1,000, people&#13;
 rendered homeless a weight of 10, and people affected a weight of 1. The sum is&#13;
 divided by population in 1980 (the midpoint of the period).&#13;

World distribution of per capita emissions&#13;
&#13;
Per capita emissions of greenhouse gases (including land use change)&#13;
differ widely across countries and regions. High-income economies have&#13;
the highest levels of emissions, but when land use change is taken into&#13;
account Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and Brazil also have significant&#13;
emissions per capita.&#13;

&amp;#12;Emissions by source, high-income and transition economies&#13;
&#13;
Nearly all greenhouse gas emissions from high-income and transition&#13;
economies (those listed in Annex I of the Kyoto Protocol) are linked to energy&#13;
use (86.6 percent), including power generation, transport, and building&#13;
heating and cooling.&#13;

Emissions by source, low-income economies&#13;
&#13;
In developing economies greenhouse gas emissions stem mostly from&#13;
land use change, forestry, and agriculture (51.2 percent). Energy-related&#13;
emissions come next (42.5 percent). Better management of land and&#13;
forests in developing economies can offer both mitigation and development&#13;
benefits.&#13;

emissions targets to reduce greenhouse gases. Non­Annex I countries are developing&#13;
countries, which have no specific greenhouse gas emissions obligations.&#13;

&amp;#12;Data notes&#13;
The data in this book are for the most recent year available; for details, see&#13;
the Glossary. Regional aggregates include data for low- and middle-income&#13;
economies only. Aggregates for regions and income groups are shown only&#13;
if data are available for 66 percent of the economies in that group.&#13;
&#13;
Symbols used:&#13;
&#13;
    0 or 0.0   indicates zero or small enough that the number rounds to zero&#13;
               at the displayed number of decimal places&#13;
&#13;
          ..   indicates that data are not available&#13;
&#13;
          $    indicates current U.S. dollars&#13;
&#13;
Data are shown for economies with populations greater than 30,000 or for&#13;
smaller economies if they are members of the World Bank. The word country&#13;
(used interchangeably with economy) does not imply political independence&#13;
or official recognition by the World Bank but refers to any economy for which&#13;
the authorities report separate social or economic statistics.&#13;

&amp;#12;                  Income group tables&#13;
For operational and analytical purposes the World Bank's main criterion&#13;
for classifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita. Every&#13;
economy in The Little Green Data Book is classified as low income, middle&#13;
income, or high income. Low- and middle-income economies are sometimes&#13;
referred to as developing economies. The use of the term is convenient; it&#13;
is not intended to imply that all economies in the group are experiencing&#13;
similar development or that other economies have reached a preferred or&#13;
final stage of development. Classification by income does not necessarily&#13;
reflect development status.&#13;
&#13;
Low-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $905 or less&#13;
in 2006.&#13;
&#13;
Middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of more than&#13;
$905 but less than $11,116. Lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income&#13;
economies are separated at a GNI per capita of $3,595.&#13;
&#13;
High-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $11,116 or&#13;
more.&#13;

            The 2008 edition of the little green
            data book includes a focus section, four introductory pages
            that focus on a specific issue related to development and
            the environment. This year the focus is on the damage from
            climate change and carbon dioxide emissions. As this focus
            shows, global warming can have negative effects on
            agriculture, health, infrastructure, and other economic
            activities effects that are likely to hit developing
            countries the hardest. While high-income countries emit more
            carbon dioxide than developing countries, emissions from
            developing countries are growing at a faster pace. And
            emissions per capita in high income countries are still five
            times higher than in developing countries.
