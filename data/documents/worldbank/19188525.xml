and Beyond&#13;
&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of 16&#13;
countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted&#13;
countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in&#13;
place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systems â&#128;&#147; in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the&#13;
African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations&#13;
Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

Strategic Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Angola is emerging from a protracted civil conflict,              impressive, and if efficiently and effectively utilized is likely&#13;
confronting significant challenges in the water and               to result in meeting the Millennium Development Goal&#13;
sanitation sector such as a need to: rebuild damaged or           target for water supply, though progress in rural areas is&#13;
decrepit infrastructure; establish an appropriate institutional   less certain than in urban. The same applies to sanitation,&#13;
framework; update policies and approaches; upgrade                with likely success in urban areas, but progress lagging&#13;
professional and technical skills; ensure transparent             and limited investments on the horizon for rural sanitation.&#13;
and equitable service delivery; strengthen planning and           Reaching the targets would be a remarkable achievement&#13;
performance monitoring; and bolster coordination across           considering the fact that Angolaâ&#128;&#153;s decades-long conflict&#13;
all levels, stakeholders, and regions.                            ended only recently in 2002.&#13;
&#13;
The war sparked unparalleled growth in the urban population       With the current emphasis on infrastructure installation,&#13;
as people migrated to the relative safety of the larger cities    service quality is likely to remain unsatisfactory until new&#13;
to avoid unpredictable violence in the countryside. Working       institutional arrangements and service delivery models&#13;
in its favor is an abundance of financial resources in striking   designed to achieve sustainability can be successfully&#13;
counterpoint to many of its regional neighbors.                   deployed, which may require upwards of a decade. So far,&#13;
                                                                  however, Angola shows positive signs of making up for so&#13;
As to whether or not Angola is on-track to meet the MDG           much lost ground.&#13;
targets, the lack of reliable data on access and the limited&#13;
availability of results from on-going investment programs         This second AMCOW Country Status Overview (CSO2) has&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;
turned into services, are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
  Sectorwide&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 An immediate assessment of sector needs in human resources, leading to the development of a comprehensive plan&#13;
     for building capacity at all levels (national, provincial, municipal/utility, and community), and within all strata (decision&#13;
     makers, managers, technicians, and users) in the private and public spheres.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Fast-track approval of the National Water Law Regulations.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Development of a national investment program for rural sanitation and hygiene promotion.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Increased and permanent support for a sectorwide information management system, including regular performance&#13;
     monitoring with targeted integration into government planning systems, and public dissemination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Renewed and reinvigorated efforts to develop a strategic plan for rural water supply, and put into place new&#13;
       implementation and management models to improve service delivery and sustainability.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Renewed and reinvigorated efforts to develop and put into place new implementation and management models for&#13;
       urban water supply to improve service delivery and cost recovery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural sanitation and hygiene&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Immediate and sustained resumption of efforts to develop and implement a national sanitation policy and strategic&#13;
       plan (including the development of a national investment program).&#13;
&#13;

1.	 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what its member&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 AMCOW delegated this&#13;
task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are implementing it&#13;
in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has been produced in&#13;
collaboration with the Government of Angola and other stakeholders during 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage in&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation. A synthesis&#13;
report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

Though a national database and information management          Few in Angola, however, accept this to be the case.&#13;

According to the JMP, access to improved water supplies        could easily surpass the rural water access targets. Figure&#13;

suggesting that the real access figures are probably not       percent; urban water supply, 82 percent; rural sanitation 31&#13;
known with any degree of certainty. National censuses and      percent; and urban sanitation, 85 percent. Methodological&#13;
surveys have been impossible during the war years, and         issues prevent these results from being fully accepted, so&#13;

The sector reform history of Angola has become                    Development Program (PDSA) have paved the way for the&#13;

reforms materialized rapidly. The first milestone is approval     The primary sector principles established by these reforms&#13;
of the National Water Law in 2002 which introduced                include: the user pays; the polluter pays; no wastewater&#13;
key reform elements such as the designation of the                collection without wastewater treatment; and all services&#13;
water basin as the basic water resources planning unit,           managed at the lowest possible level.5 However, the PDSA&#13;
recognition of water as both a social and an economic             has not been fully implemented.&#13;

and the possibility of alternative management models for          To restructure and modernize the urban water supply&#13;
urban service provision. The regulations for the Water            and sanitation subsector, the GoA joined with the World&#13;
Law, however, have not as yet been approved.                      Bank in creating a Water Sector Institutional Development&#13;

A further important aspect of the legal framework is              being introduced. These include Autonomous Provincial&#13;
the Law of Local State Administrative Units in 2007,              Water and Sanitation Utilities, a regulatory agency&#13;
complementing the 1999 Decentralization Law and                   for urban water supply and sanitation, and a National&#13;
further extending powers and responsibilities to provincial       Institute for Water Resources. An asset management unit&#13;
and municipal governments, primarily through a process            for urban infrastructure will be established within the&#13;

&#13;
The sectorâ&#128;&#153;s recent history puts the service delivery pathway     Figure 3&#13;
in context, which can then be explored in detail using the        Average scorecard results for enabling,&#13;
CSO2 scorecard, an assessment tool providing a snapshot           sustaining, and developing service delivery, and&#13;
of reform progress throughout the pathway. The CSO2               peer-group comparison&#13;
scorecard assesses the building blocks of service delivery&#13;
                                                                                            Enabling&#13;
in turn: three building blocks which relate to enabling&#13;
services, three which relate to developing new services,&#13;
and three which relate to sustaining services. Each building&#13;
block is assessed against specific indicators and scored&#13;
from 1 to 3 accordingly.4&#13;
&#13;
Angolaâ&#128;&#153;s reform efforts appear to have focused on the&#13;
enabling building blocks of the service delivery pathway,&#13;
particularly with regard to planning. Figure 3 shows that&#13;
this is where Angola registers the highest scorecard result,              Sustaining                     Developing&#13;

As discussed in Section 2, the main financing challenges       in 2007, only 25.6 percent of all projects listed in the official&#13;
in Angola are not ostensibly about availability of funds,      investment plan were completed (589 of 2,300), while in&#13;
except perhaps for rural sanitation. However, in terms of      2008 the percentage had dropped to a mere 10 percent&#13;
the quality and performance of systems for organizing          (376 of 3,733). Tracking disbursement (and allocations) is&#13;
those funds (indicators for which are shown in Figure 6)       difficult because data are not comprehensively segregated&#13;
all subsectors lag behind peers. This is partly because of     by sectors, though it is stated that 58 of the 376 projects&#13;

Disbursement: Absorbing massive budget outlays.&#13;
The challenge of allocating and efficiently utilizing such&#13;
large sums is daunting, and disbursement rates are&#13;
characteristically low, but improving year-to-year. In&#13;
                                                                   USH                                   UWS&#13;
2005, for example, only US$15 million was spent of the&#13;
US$185 million in allocations, or around 8 percent of the&#13;
total. By 2008 the amounts had risen to US$194 million&#13;
and US$432 million, respectively, implying a utilization&#13;
rate of nearly 45 percent. While the percentage actually&#13;
                                                                                         RSH&#13;

however, government revenues were to drop unexpectedly                     in specific areas of need such as urban sector reform or&#13;

Expenditure tracking: A challenge. The budget                              of limited donor funding is that Angola has exceptional&#13;

 which are not always considered by the JMP as improved              on each segment of the service delivery pathway, unlike&#13;

 households sharing facilities in Angola, which although             strengths (Figures 20 and 21). The rural sanitation subsector&#13;

On the other hand, such technologies are expensive.&#13;
Of the GoAâ&#128;&#153;s proposed US$3 billion in sector financing&#13;
over the period, approximately half that amount is for&#13;
networked sewerage.25 Currently only five Angolan cities&#13;
have sewerage networks, and only two of these five&#13;
actually have some level of sewage treatment. The Luanda&#13;
system has been categorized as being â&#128;&#156;in a state of                                                             Developing&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Angola :
            turning finance into services for 2015 and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The African Ministers' Council on
            Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round
            of Country Status Overviews (CSOs) to better understands
            what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and
            what its member governments can do to accelerate that
            progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). AMCOW
            delegated this task to the World Bank's Water and
            Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are
            implementing it in close partnership with United Nations
            Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization
            (WHO) in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has
            been produced in collaboration with the Government of Angola
            and other stakeholders during 2009/10. The analysis aims to
            help countries assess their own service delivery pathways
            for turning finance into water supply and sanitation
            services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water
            supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene. The CSO2
            analysis has three main components: a review of past
            coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of future
            investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of
            particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.
            The CSO2's contribution is to answer not only whether
            past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector
            targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to
            ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated
            coverage in water supply and sanitation. In this spirit,
            specific priority actions have been identified through
            consultation. A synthesis report, available separately,
            presents best practice and shared learning to help realize
            these priority actions.
