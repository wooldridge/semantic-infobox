&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
G    rowth recovery in 2014 is certainly good news. This time last year, we estimated the 2014&#13;
     growth rate at 5.7 percent. Against all odds, the economy grew by 7 percent. However,&#13;
growth outlook is not entirely bright. While the oil price decline has brought a positive impact on&#13;
inflation and trade, recent economic indicators show some weaknesses. Also, global risks (e.g.,&#13;
an increase in US interest rate, slowdown of Chinese and Euro economies, and an appreciation&#13;
of the US dollar) are emerging. In the medium to long-term, Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s economic resilience&#13;
will not be achieved without keeping high investment rates. However, the current investment&#13;
model (high public investment funded by aid) is not likely to be sustainable; given capacity&#13;
constraints to maintain high public investment and possible decline in aid relative to GDP in&#13;
the medium-term. Finding alternative sources of development financing is a key determinant&#13;
of future growth. Development of the financial sector is critical to mobilize both domestic and&#13;
foreign saving for financing development. This is the message of the Eighth Edition of the&#13;
Rwanda Economic Update (REU).&#13;

     four characteristics: (i) high growth and                                    sectors (i.e., export crop, manufacturing and&#13;
low per capita income; (ii) high public and low                                   mining), which account for only nine percent of&#13;
private investment; (iii) low exports and small                                   GDP. Consequently, the share of exports of goods&#13;
tradable sector; and (iv) high reliance on aid in                                 and services in the economy is lower than Kenya,&#13;

Second, the financial sector will play a key role                           of the population, household savings will be&#13;
in attracting foreign saving. Access to finance is a                        stunted. People need a secure, accessible vehicle&#13;

Imports from EAC countries increased by 10 percent per year, to US$547 million in 2014, from US$308 million&#13;
in 2008. However, the EACs share of total imports has started to decrease after the peak in 2010 (Box Figure 1.1).&#13;
The trend is the same even if energy imports are excluded (Box Figure 1.2).&#13;

    Magnitude: In the past three years, 2012 through 2014, informal exports from Rwanda to the neighboring&#13;
    countries, (including Burundi, DRC, Tanzania, and Uganda), were about US$100 million, while informal&#13;
    imports from these countries were around US$20 million. Thus, informal exports account for about 15 percent&#13;
    of the total exports (sum of formal and informal trade), while informal imports account for 1 percent of the total&#13;
    imports (Box Table 2.1).&#13;

    Policy implication: The positive informal trade balance (US$80-90 million a year) has been contributed to the&#13;
    easing of BoP pressure (the informal trade is included in the BoP). In light of the importance of informal trade&#13;
    in mitigating the current account deficit, removing formal and informal barriers to trade, such as, improving&#13;
    infrastructure, reducing harassment, normalizing relationships between traders and officials, bringing better&#13;
    regulatory transparency to the border environment, are the critical stepping stones to formalization.&#13;

                    - Tax revenues were below projection by 2 percent&#13;
                    - Capital expenditures were blow projection by 9 percent&#13;

 Key Points&#13;
 â&#128;¢ Bankâ&#128;&#153;s growth projections for 2015 and 2016 are unchanged from the previous edition.&#13;
 â&#128;¢ The projections assume execution of government expenditures as budgeted and good weather&#13;
   conditions.&#13;
 â&#128;¢ Monthly economic indicators show mixed directions. While the decline in capital goods imports&#13;
   is negative, the acceleration of credit growth is a positive sign.&#13;

Economic Update. In the agriculture sector,                                    regarding inflation and exchange rates to&#13;
while export crop production was lower than                                    date indicate that there is little inflationary&#13;
projected, the sector was compensated by stronger                              pressure and exchange rate deprecation&#13;
growth rates of others. In the industry sector,                                in the near future. As Rwanda is a net&#13;
lower than projected manufacturing growth was                                  oil importer, the sharp drop in oil prices&#13;
compensated by stronger construction growth.                                   is likely to have a positive impact on the&#13;

     (ii)	 Policy flexibility: These factors would                     in investment. A second risk is the continued&#13;
           contribute to increased fiscal and                          decline in commodity prices of Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s main&#13;

           macroeconomic stability and continued                       risk is regional instability: tourism receipts are&#13;

     (iv)	 Positive regional economic outlook:                         period in 2014, the negative capital goods import&#13;
           Given the close relationships with                          growth in recent months is a negative sign. Also,&#13;
           neighboring countries such as EAC                           fiscal policy in the past few quarters was less&#13;

The outlook for continued poverty reduction                            structural bottlenecks, such as, heavy reliance&#13;
is positive. Food crop production, the main                            on aid and the dominance of the public sector&#13;
livelihood for the bulk of the poor, sustained                         in the economy. Given a possible decline in&#13;
its strong performance, growing at an average                          the share of aid in the medium term, the role&#13;
rate of 5.5 percent between 2011 and 2014,                             of public expenditure is expected to shift from&#13;
with a favorable outlook through at least 2016.                        driving growth to catalyzing it. Maintaining high&#13;
Household consumption grew about 5 percent                             growth and creating jobs to accommodate a fast-&#13;

Nevertheless, a number of factors pose risks                           particular, it is important to mobilize additional&#13;

Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s near-term outlook depends on the                              improved public investment management. While&#13;
implementation of the government budget,                               public investment has played the central role in&#13;

is critical.17 In order to realize investment and                    strengthen tax and regulatory reform to spur&#13;
capital accumulation, investments have to be                         medium and large enterprise growth, and attract&#13;
well financed.                                                       large investorsâ&#128;&#157;. Though quantitative targets&#13;

The Government has been well aware of this                           programs, FSDP II aims to achieve the gross&#13;
issue. Vision 2020, the countryâ&#128;&#153;s long-term                          national saving rate at 20 percent of GDP by 2020.&#13;
development strategy, formulated in 2010, refers                     The macroeconomic framework of the EDPRS 2&#13;

on external aid.18 In order to meet this need, the&#13;
Government formulated the National Savings                           However, increasing the saving rate is&#13;
Mobilization Strategy in 2009, with the main                         challenging for Rwanda, especially due to a&#13;
focus of â&#128;&#156;meeting and funding increased                              likely decline in aid in the coming period (aid&#13;
investment requirements through mobilization                         is part of foreign saving). According to the latest&#13;

2.2. Overview of Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s Saving and Investment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I n the past five years, 2010 to 2014, investment&#13;
  (i.e., gross fixed capital formation) as a&#13;
share of GDP reached 24.2 percent. Private&#13;
                                                                     GDP minus consumption, was 9.2 percent. Thus,&#13;
                                                                     the foreign saving rate should equal 15.1 percent&#13;
                                                                     (Table 2.1 and Figure 2.1).&#13;
investment accounted for 10.9 percent and&#13;
government (public) investment was accounted                         Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s investment rate is slightly higher&#13;
for 13.4 percent. Investment should be financed                      than the average of low and middle income&#13;
by saving. Thus, saving (including both domestic                     countries at 23 percent in 2013. However,&#13;
and foreign) is equal to investment and the saving                   a striking feature of Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s investment is&#13;
rate should also be 24.2 percent of GDP. Of the                      its high public investment and low private&#13;
total saving rate, the gross domestic saving rate,                   investment; although the year 2013 is a bit&#13;
17&#13;
  	 Madsen (2000) â&#128;&#156;The causality between investment and economic growthâ&#128;&#157;, shows that growth is predominately caused by investment in&#13;
    machinery and equipment, whereas investment in non-residential buildings and structures is predominantly caused by economic growth.&#13;

&#13;
 Box 2.2 Targeted Financial Literacy Program is the Key for Saving&#13;
     Saving is crucial not only for economic growth, but also poverty alleviation at household levels. Saving allows&#13;
     households to accumulate capital to invest in education, pay for health care, and fund seeds of entrepreneurship.&#13;
     Lack of access to banking has been a challenge, especially for the rural poor. Households without access to banks&#13;
     often save at home or save in non-monetary assets like cows. In either case, interest cannot be accrued. Financial&#13;
     institutions are reluctant to provide services to the rural poor due to high cost. The number of individuals in the&#13;
     world without access to banks is estimated at 2 billion (Demirguc-Kunt et al., 2015).&#13;
&#13;
     How can we change saving behavior? - Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s case studies&#13;
     Rwanda is one of the rare countries in Sub-Saharan Africa which has rapidly expanding access to finance. The&#13;
     introduction of 416 Umurenge SACCOs in 2009 has improved financial inclusion, now covering more than 90&#13;
     percent of Rwandans within a five-kilometer radius of Umurenge SACCOs. The improvement in financial&#13;
     inclusion, however, has yet to change householdsâ&#128;&#153; saving behavior. Although the number rural households&#13;
     saved money at increased rate of 31.1 percent&#13;
     to 53.9 percent between 2011 and 2014, those Box Table 2.1: Saving behavior by groups (%, age 15+)&#13;
     that saved at a financial institution increased                                                     Saved at a financial&#13;

     with a smaller magnitude from 19.4 percent                                                               institution?&#13;

                                                            straightforward; and (ii) the estimates of account ownership for urban&#13;

     reach the closest SACCO (Kerosi, Iyikirenga            detailed explanation.&#13;
     and Msaki, 2014).                                Source: The Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database, 2014.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     This, however, does not mean that rural households cannot save at financial institutions. Financial literacy&#13;
     training can help households to save. Sayinzoga et al. (2014) provided experimental financial literacy training in&#13;
     rural areas.27 One-week training not only improved their financial literacy, but changed their financial behavior.&#13;
     Participants started to save at financial institutions. In addition, non-borrowing farmers took up loans and started&#13;
     new income-generating activities, and indebted farmers improved repayment performance. A cross-country survey&#13;
     finds that a financial literacy program can be effective. Specifically if it focuses on awareness and attitude more than&#13;
     numerical skills, on targeted groupsâ&#128;&#148;especially women, the youth and the poor than general public, and lastly,&#13;
     by building trust between households and financial institutions by improving governance and products offered&#13;
     (Xu and Zia, 2013). These findings tell us that well-targeted financial literacy programs can change householdsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
     saving behavior.&#13;
&#13;
     To contribute to the goal set by Vision 2020, transforming the country into a middle-income country by 2020, the&#13;
     second Financial Sector Development Program seeks to develop a stable, sound and efficient financial sector, and&#13;
     target financial inclusion as a key program to achieve this end. With support from Access to Finance Rwanda,&#13;
     funded by the UK government, World Bank, and KfW, the National Financial Education Strategy was established&#13;
     in 2011, with the aim of deepening and broadening Rwandanâ&#128;&#153;s financial literacy. The strategy defines the scope&#13;
     of financial education, both at the national and priority group levels, and provides an appropriate foundation for&#13;
     consumer protection. MINECOFIN, in close collaboration with BNR, has been taking a leading role to develop&#13;
     the strategy.28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26&#13;
  	 The 2012 FinCap Survey also confirmed that the majority of Rwandans lack sufficient knowledge of numeracy, cash flow management, future&#13;
    planning, and financial services usages.&#13;
27&#13;
  	 The training program consisted of six modules: (i) cooperative principles; (ii) explanation of microfinance activities, savings and credit; (iii)&#13;
    how to develop a business plan for small, income-generating activity; (iv) loan management,(v) basic bookkeeping and management of small&#13;
    income-generating projects; and (vi) example business plans for small income-generating projects.&#13;

T    he development of the financial sector&#13;
     in Rwanda is essential for financing&#13;
development, for two reasons. First, the positive&#13;
                                                                      Access to finance is a prerequisite for transferring&#13;

relationship between domestic saving and                              On FDI, in addition to its financing function,&#13;
development of the financial sector suggests that                     â&#128;&#156;financial markets allow the backward linkages&#13;
the financial sector will be able to mobilize more                    between foreign and domestic firms to turn into&#13;
domestic saving, especially through improving                         FDI spilloversâ&#128;&#157;.31 Development of capital market&#13;

&#13;
 Box 2.3 Leveraging migration for financing development&#13;
 World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s note on Migration and Development32 finds that the total migrantsâ&#128;&#153; remittance reached US$436&#13;
 billion in 2014. Of which, US$33 billion was for Sub-Saharan Africa. Among Sub-Saharan African countries,&#13;
 remittances reached more than 20 percent of GDP in the Gambia and Lesotho. The cost of sending money in Sub-&#13;
 Saharan Africa (12 percent) is higher than the global average (8 percent) by 50 percent. It also argues that as much&#13;
 as US$100 billion or more, could be raised annually by developing countries via:&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Mobilizing diaspora savings: A diaspora bond issued by a country of origin could be attractive to migrant&#13;
     workers who hold deposits in host-country banks;&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Reducing remittance costs: The introduction of online and mobile money transfer systems in many developing&#13;
     countries offers new opportunities for more cost-effective means of sending money.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Reducing migrant recruitment costs: Recruitment costs by migrant workers to recruitment agents, on top of&#13;
     the fees paid by the employers, are a major drain on poor migrantsâ&#128;&#153; income and remittances.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Mobilizing philanthropic contributions from the diaspora: Some governments have attempted to channel&#13;
     collective remittances through Home Town Associations by offering matching grants.&#13;

By issuing a five-year bond, the IFC helped in               to diversify their portfolios. The order book was&#13;

&#13;
Box 3.1 Why are Government debt markets and yield curves important?&#13;
 Government debt markets have a special role to play in the development of capital markets. In particular, they&#13;
 provide:&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 A comparatively risk-free asset that allows fund managers and other investors, including pension funds and&#13;
     insurance companies, to build asset portfolios that are efficient in meeting a chosen risk/return profile; and&#13;
     which, as collateral, supports the development of parallel markets.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 A benchmark for pricing corporate bonds and other assets, including long-term loans as well as insurance&#13;
     liabilities under IFRS; this benchmark is usually represented by the government bond yield curve.&#13;
&#13;
 Developing government debt markets is a dynamic Box Figure 3.1: Yield curves in East Africa&#13;

 posed to investors are not overly burdensome. On&#13;

 The regular government debt issuance in Rwanda&#13;

 Box 3.2 Capital market integration in Latin America. Learning from the MILA initiative&#13;
 In 2011, the exchanges of Chile, Colombia and Peru, together with their respective central securities depositories&#13;
 launched a consolidated regional exchange known as MILA, Mercado Integrado Latinoamericano or Latin&#13;
 American Integrated Market. The first stage of the MILA integration initiative established a unified trading&#13;
 platform which permits brokers and investors located in each of these three countries to invest directly in equities&#13;
 listed on any of the three exchanges. In December 2014, the Mexican stock exchange and securities depository&#13;
 joined MILA. The establishment of MILA created an exchange which is now the largest in the region in terms of&#13;
 the number of listed companies, with more than 750 companies quoted and a market capitalization of US$ 988&#13;
 billion (as of December 2014).&#13;
&#13;
 By pooling liquidity and deepening capital markets, each of the MILA countries were better positioned to compete&#13;
 for foreign investment flows with the larger Latin American markets such as Brazil or Mexico before it joined,&#13;
 and by creating greater scale, lower transactions costs and improve cross-border investment efficiencies. The&#13;
 combined market also allows investors across the region to diversify their portfolio holdings. For example, most&#13;
 investorsâ&#128;&#153; holdings in Peru are concentrated in the mining sector which dominates the local exchange. A more&#13;
 diversified MILA portfolio might be expanded to encompass exposure to Chilean retailing firms or Colombian&#13;
 construction companies. Other benefits include the ability to attract more major institutional investors based on&#13;
 the increased market depth and new trading opportunities. The primary market activity is also expected to grow&#13;
 through more IPOs by medium-size firms that had historically shied away from accessing the equity market due to&#13;
 the limited number of potential buyers.&#13;
&#13;
 An interesting feature of the MILA integration is the fact that while all three exchanges are fairly well-developed&#13;
 by international standards, there is still a relatively wide gap between the Chilean Stock Exchange (Market Cap:&#13;
 US$233 billion), the Colombian exchange (Market Cap: US$153 billion) and the Peruvian exchange (Market Cap:&#13;
 US$121 billion). The Mexican exchange is now the dominating exchange with a market cap of US$ 481 billion.&#13;
 As is typical of other regional integration projects, it is usually the smaller countries, in this case Peru, that stands&#13;
 to benefit the most from the MILA initiative. As Alonso Segura, Head of Strategy at Banco de Credito del Peru,&#13;
 explained: â&#128;&#156;It is like free-trade agreements, the smaller party often accrues the greater benefit. The BVL may mean&#13;
 relatively little to Colombia and Chile, but this means a lot to us.â&#128;&#157; Similarly, as Hugo Perea, Chief Economist of&#13;
 BBVA noted, â&#128;&#156;Before, a foreign investor would worry about being able to get out of their position if they bought&#13;
 shares in the BVL. But the MILA opens the market up to a greater number of buyers and thus may help to allay&#13;
 some of these concerns.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

  	 CPI covers prices of a typical basket of goods and services purchased by typical consumer. This metric measures the price change of a basket&#13;
    of goods and services from the perspective of the consumer.&#13;
54&#13;
  	 PPI covers prices of goods produced by domestic producers. It looks at prices changes from the perspective of the producer.&#13;

  	 Contemporaneous correlated means variables change in the same direction in the same period of time.&#13;

            Financing development : the role of a
            deeper and more diversified financial sector
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Growth recovery in 2014 is certainly
            good news. This time last year, we estimated the 2014 growth
            rate at 5.7 percent. Against all odds, the economy grew by 7
            percent. However,growth outlook is not entirely bright.
            While the oil price decline has brought a positive impact
            oninflation and trade, recent economic indicators show some
            weaknesses. Also, global risks (e.g.,an increase in US
            interest rate, slowdown of Chinese and Euro economies, and
            an appreciationof the US dollar) are emerging. In the medium
            to long-term, Rwanda’s economic resiliencewill not be
            achieved without keeping high investment rates. However, the
            current investmentmodel (high public investment funded by
            aid) is not likely to be sustainable; given
            capacityconstraints to maintain high public investment and
            possible decline in aid relative to GDP inthe medium-term.
            Finding alternative sources of development financing is a
