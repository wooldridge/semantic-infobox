&#13;
ZENNI: Good morning. I am Marie Zenni, Senior Interviewer for the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s Oral History&#13;
Program.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: I am Ana-Maria Arriagada, Director for the Performance of Development&#13;
Department, formally HRSLO.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Okay. Today is Tuesday, December 11, 2007, and Iâ&#128;&#152;m here at World Bank&#13;
headquarters to interview Ms. Arriagada who will be retiring officially from the World Bank&#13;
Group in a few days on December 15, 2007. Welcome Ms. Arriagada.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Iâ&#128;&#152;d like to begin by discussing your background in general, including your educational&#13;
background, and how you became interested in economic development?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Iâ&#128;&#152;m originally from Chile, and at the time when I was growing up and I was&#13;
going to a very good school and I had access to all the information, knowledge and opportunities&#13;
to learn, I was reminded, pretty much on a regular basis, on how lucky I was to have this access&#13;
and the opportunities that I had. Somehow I think that stuck with me; itâ&#128;&#152;s a big, big thing in&#13;
terms of having to give back to those that are less fortunate than you are. And some images from&#13;
childhood coming up in terms of every night at my parentâ&#128;&#152;s house after dinner, there was this&#13;
woman who came to get the scraps, the leftovers from our dinner to feed her children, and that&#13;
has stuck with me forever. So poverty and economic development were for me kind of the&#13;
fundamental vocation, I would say, and interest from very early on. And I always knew I would&#13;
work in something related to helping people less privileged than you are. It ended up being in&#13;
economic development; as I grew up and matured, I realized the kinds of things I liked to do, and&#13;
that led me very much also into being interested in human development and education in&#13;
particular. So thatâ&#128;&#152;s that.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Okay. What in your pre-Bank experience led to your formally joining the Bank? And&#13;
how did this actually come about?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Well, I never intended to join the Bank. I joined the Bank out of pure luck, I&#13;
would say, and need. Luck, because I came to this country to do a Masters in economics and I&#13;
did, and my graduation work for the Masters was an econometric piece of work on educational&#13;
achievement and educational financing in Peru. I got very good grades in my dissertation work,&#13;
and my professor sent it to someone working here at the Bank. And the next thing I know, I get&#13;
a phone call from somebody at the Bank inviting me to replicate that work and do it for other&#13;
countries. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s how I came to the Bank. And then I realized that if I worked here I could&#13;
afford financing my own Ph.D. So I joined the Bank. And the more I got to understand the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                               December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
place and how it works I realized the huge potential for actually making things happen that this&#13;
organization has. And I started to really enjoy myself and the organization.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: So you officially joined in March of â&#128;&#152;82?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: And you began your career as Research Assistant then Analyst in the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
Education and Training Department where you remained until the end of â&#128;&#152;89.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Please discuss this initial period of your career in terms of responsibilities, areas of&#13;
particular focus, and impact on your future thinking about economic development.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Well, at the time I was a graduate student and I was working mostly on&#13;
researching the economics of education. I was fortunate enough to have landed in the Bank at&#13;
the time when the organization had decided to truly invest in understanding and developing a&#13;
strategy about the relevance of human capital investments for economic development. Now it&#13;
was a time when people like Nancy Birdsall, Dean Jamison, George Psacharopoulos, Ralph&#13;
Harbison, Steve Heyneman and others were brought into the organization. There was a--I would&#13;
believe--a very deliberate effort to create a critical mass of very good technical people to&#13;
basically work on the importance of human capital investments and so on. And I was very lucky&#13;
to be part of that initiative.&#13;
&#13;
Later I also worked with another initiative in research that in my mind has been absolutely&#13;
fundamental for the role of the organization, which was the Living Standard Measurements&#13;
Study to develop tools to measure poverty and welfare. There was a group of people who&#13;
basically developed this instrument to measure and assess all the dimensions of welfare and&#13;
poverty, including education, health care, access to basic services, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
So to me, I would say that those experiences were fabulous learning experiences because I was&#13;
able to apply what I was learning in school, basically. This was extremely important because&#13;
they were creating the Bank of today in terms of a Bank that sees development in a more holistic&#13;
and comprehensive way.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: And how did Bank efforts on education at the time compare with those of other&#13;
international organizations? Did you get a sense of that at the time?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Actually, at the time and even now when I look back I think the Bank played a&#13;
very important catalyzing role in education for development or the role of education in&#13;
developing countries and really putting together a whole framework and approach to address&#13;
educational policy and education interventions in developing countries. I would say that the&#13;
Bank played the role that it is supposed to play, in the sense of it being a global organization that&#13;
looks into issues of public goods type of things where there is no interest in the private sector&#13;
and/or others or no comparative advantage for them or no ability to really look across the world&#13;
&#13;
                                    Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                                December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the way the Bank can. So in that regard, I think this role was extremely influential, as I saw later&#13;
on in Latin America.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: How did Bank support for structural and sectoral adjustment reform in its lending&#13;
operations, beginning in 1980, impact its analytical and sector work in general and, more&#13;
specifically, your endeavors in education?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Well, you know, I joined the Bank in the early â&#128;&#151;80s. I was involved directly&#13;
mostly in research projects, so I was looking at these things pretty much from afar. I was not&#13;
linked to operational work, so I donâ&#128;&#152;t have firsthand experience of the early â&#128;&#151;80s period. But&#13;
later on when I moved to the Latin America region I realized how flawed it was to introduce&#13;
structural adjustment programs in countries without paying, in the beginning, much attention to&#13;
the undesirable consequences of adjustment on poverty levels, on human capital investment, et&#13;
cetera. So by the time I joined Operations in 1990-1989, looking into the social impacts of&#13;
structural adjustment was absolutely essential for the agenda. I was extraordinarily fortunate, I&#13;
think, that I joined a region at the time when there was very clear consciousness of the need to&#13;
look into this because that made my skills be very relevant and used very widely in a number of&#13;
structural adjustment programs that the Bank was carrying out. And actually some great work&#13;
came from that experience, from countries that were going under structural adjustment that at the&#13;
same time were trying to do what needed to be done in the long run for their population in the&#13;
social area.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Well, just for the record, from January 1990 until â&#128;&#152;94 you moved to the Latin America&#13;
region as an economist, focusing exclusively on human development issues. And youâ&#128;&#152;ve already&#13;
spoken a little about some of your focus, but what were your main responsibilities then, and what&#13;
objectives did you set out to accomplish for the region?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: I first moved to the Technical Department--at that time there were Technical&#13;
Departments--but very quickly within a year I was drawn into a Country Department and I&#13;
moved to the Mexico and Central America Department. I worked largely in the beginning in&#13;
Mexico and Central America, basically opening up a relationship in the social sectors for the&#13;
Bank and these governments. There were countries where we had either never been before or,&#13;
like in the case of Nicaragua, we had been involved many, many years prior. Basically, opening&#13;
up the policy dialogue with the Mexicans about their social indicators, their states, the status of&#13;
their health and education systems, looking into disparities within the country, and so on, and&#13;
that was instrumental, I believe, to opening up both analytical and lending work with the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
The other major experiences were in post-war countries. I was part of the teams that went back&#13;
to both El Salvador and Nicaragua after their civil wars. Those have been to a very significant&#13;
extent very rewarding and interesting jobs. In the case of El Salvador, it had its first&#13;
democratically elected government in many years, and part of the challenge was, on one hand, to&#13;
have a structural adjustment program that would improve their finances and enable growth and,&#13;
at the same time, start rebuilding the country and the basic services. Actually thatâ&#128;&#152;s how I&#13;
decided to move to Operations because at the time I still was in the . .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Education Department . .&#13;
&#13;
                                    Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                                December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Yes, and somebody invited me to join a mission to do an assessment of the&#13;
social sectors in El Salvador and propose what should be the government social policies. And I&#13;
realized then that this was where the action really is because you could actually affect policy&#13;
making and decision making in countries.&#13;
&#13;
So itâ&#128;&#152;s very interesting, upon reflection, when you look at countries that have come out of wars&#13;
like those two, Nicaragua and El Salvador. I think the sense of how bad life can be and how bad&#13;
things can get with a war and the loss of lives, the uncertainty, the fear, and all that it entails, the&#13;
upheaval in everything, made the discussions go very much to the bottom line very quickly. It is&#13;
almost as if people are really looking at the issues of their own country and what needs to be&#13;
done from a certain perspective that is very different than the business-as-usual approach that&#13;
you see in a normal situation. So in terms of the kinds of counterparts I donâ&#128;&#152;t think I can recall&#13;
better â&#128;&#149;counterpartsâ&#128;&#150; than the ones I had in those countries . .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Post-conflict countries?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: . . post-conflict. You know they may not have been the most experienced&#13;
people, but they were certainly very clear in what they needed to do, and why. And, they were&#13;
people committed to making their countries better, full stop. And that can make a huge&#13;
difference in the kind of work and the quality of what you can do.&#13;
&#13;
I can give you an example which is personally very meaningful to me, and that was the work&#13;
developing a community-managed school programs. That was my first project as a task&#13;
manager. Iâ&#128;&#152;m pretty convinced that I probably wouldnâ&#128;&#152;t have done it that way if I had known the&#13;
problems I would have inside the Bank to get it done. And, you know, today, fifteen years later,&#13;
community-managed schools and community-managed anything is a mainstream thing in this&#13;
organization. At the time, our mandate was to look for ways to ensure the provision of basic&#13;
education services to the El Salvadorian poor in rural areas who hadnâ&#128;&#152;t had services for the&#13;
decade that they had the war. We realized very quickly that just building schools and hiring&#13;
teachers was not going to do the job because the incentive systems were totally wrong; you&#13;
couldnâ&#128;&#152;t hold teachers accountable. There were a number of systemic factors that required&#13;
changing the constitution and all kinds of laws to make this work; therefore, other ways needed&#13;
to be found. And the way we worked it out was by basically not inventing anything, but&#13;
basically just being open to what communities and people themselves had been doing during the&#13;
war. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s how we came up with the concept of having parentsâ&#128;&#152; associations managing schools&#13;
and hiring and firing teachers and running the show. The Bank provided money directly to these&#13;
schools, one hundred and fifty dollars per school every month, with the Ministry of Education&#13;
playing a supervisory and enabling role.&#13;
&#13;
I remember at the time I didnâ&#128;&#152;t think this was a big deal; it was just common sense in my mind.&#13;
However, thatâ&#128;&#152;s when I started to learn that this Organization has an incredible bureaucracy and&#13;
bureaucratic machinery that makes common sense look impossible. I even got called by my&#13;
vice-president at the time, Shahid Hussain, who had heard all kinds of noise about this crazy girl-&#13;
-at the time I was a â&#128;&#149;girlâ&#128;&#150; in the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s language--trying to do this. And he wanted to&#13;
understand what was I doing. It sounded intriguing to him. And when I explained to him what&#13;
&#13;
                                     Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                                 December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
were the options and that if we did go about this the usual way, which is hiring teachers and&#13;
building schools in the public sector, weâ&#128;&#152;d spend a lot of money and not much would happen.&#13;
He kind of bought in and said, â&#128;&#149;Why not? This is a small a country. Itâ&#128;&#152;s not a lot of money. Go&#13;
for it.â&#128;&#150; And he also gave me advice that I thought was very good that I still pass on to other&#13;
people, which was, â&#128;&#149;Listen, in this place you can do anything you want, but you have to work the&#13;
system. You have to figure out who do you need and what do you need to handle, and handle&#13;
it.â&#128;&#150; And I followed that advice and found it, one, very pragmatic, and two, very true, in my own&#13;
experience in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
What I do see, though, is that the effort of managing that internal part over time is gone up and&#13;
up. As time went by, much more time is being taken by dealing with the inside of the&#13;
organization as opposed to working with your clients.&#13;
&#13;
Another thing was the experience in Nicaragua and El Salvador working with other donors.&#13;
Everybody was involved in these countries at that time because they were post-conflict countries.&#13;
And it became clear very early on what a huge gain it was for us and for the country to work well&#13;
with donors. These people had lots of free money, grant money, that we didnâ&#128;&#152;t, and the&#13;
possibility of having national programs was a huge deal. In the case of Nicaragua, for example,&#13;
we had a group of donors very divided politically, but we managed to find common areas of&#13;
interest that were absolutely central to the Bank, to them, and to the country. So, for example,&#13;
we put together a whole consortium of donors to implement and put in place the national&#13;
statistical system so that you could actually measure and have data to measure poverty, assess the&#13;
differences within the country, within different groups between regions, et cetera, et cetera. For&#13;
that work we were the catalyzers; we provided the technical part through the LSMS [Living&#13;
Standards Measurement Study] and the work of DEC [Development Economics] colleagues, and&#13;
every single donor participated in abundance. This intervention created a system of household&#13;
surveys that are used for all kinds of things, from targeting public expenditures and aid programs&#13;
to developing appropriate policies for indigenous people, et cetera. It was an interesting&#13;
experience.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Moving on to the succession of promotions you had that were two years apart. In June&#13;
of â&#128;&#152;95, you were promoted to Senior Economist then two years later, to Sector Leader while still&#13;
in the Latin American Region. In July of â&#128;&#152;99, you were promoted to Sector Manager, Social&#13;
Protection, again in Latin America and the Caribbean. Would you like to talk about these&#13;
promotions and how they came about?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: When I think about my promotions and why I was asked to play the different&#13;
roles I played, I think there were a couple of things that matter because they helped me be&#13;
successful working with clients in the Bank. And the first of those was basically the willingness&#13;
to listen to clientsâ&#128;&#152; needs; what theyâ&#128;&#152;re really saying to you, and be willing to question my own&#13;
point of view or the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s point of view in order to get things done. And the second was, I&#13;
think, the interest in getting things done for your clients, which takes to include all the different&#13;
players that are part of the thing whether you like it or not. Unless you forge alliances,&#13;
agreements, and deals that everybody can live with and that they all want, things are not&#13;
sustainable; things will disappear the minute you turn your back. And to me those were very,&#13;
very important learnings and a fundamental reason why I was promoted and given more and&#13;
&#13;
                                    Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                                December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
more responsibility. Iâ&#128;&#152;d been willing to be wrong many times, as long as we get there, no&#13;
problem. And I find that is--was something hard to do. Personally, you like to be right and to&#13;
know everything all the time and control everything, but thatâ&#128;&#152;s not how it works.&#13;
&#13;
The Sector Leader job was the best job Iâ&#128;&#152;ve ever had in the Bank because I represented Human&#13;
Development but I was part of both the management teams in a country unit and the sector unit.&#13;
So I was focusing on a number of countries, and I was working together with a lead economist, a&#13;
lead person for infrastructure and finance, the lead person for rural and agriculture, and so on. It&#13;
was phenomenal. The amount of synergies and the possibilities of doing things better on behalf&#13;
of the Bank for these countries was just wonderful. And I think I had one of the best directors,&#13;
Donna Dowsett, who was absolutely a master at running this orchestra. We all played different&#13;
instruments, but the music was good.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Now letâ&#128;&#152;s focus on your promotion in July of â&#128;&#152;99 to Sector Manager, Social Protection,&#13;
for Latin America and the Caribbean, and you somewhat covered discussing your endeavors.&#13;
Did you wish to add how this promotion came about, and how would you describe your&#13;
transition to line manager including the challenges you faced in terms of oversight&#13;
responsibilities both as line and sector manager?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Yeah. Well, that was a hard transition for me. I applied to this job because--I&#13;
was pretty bored of not having good managers, and the option was either I applied for the job or&#13;
accepted someone I wouldnâ&#128;&#152;t be happy with as my boss. Iâ&#128;&#152;m very glad I did it in the sense that&#13;
you have a lot more responsibility, opportunities and the ability to influence people in the&#13;
Organization in a way that you donâ&#128;&#152;t have otherwise. I truly appreciated this as an enormous&#13;
opportunity. But there is also a sense of disappointment because the job made me experience&#13;
this organization in a different way, in a completely different way. It made me experience the&#13;
Bank as a bureaucracy, the Bank as a political organization, the Bank as an internally self-&#13;
serving entity, and that is not pretty.&#13;
&#13;
And how would I describe my transition? I would describe it as bumpy because nobody warned&#13;
me. I mean, you just swim or sink.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: You are talking specifically as a line manager now.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: The first line manager job. I read a job description and I saw managing people&#13;
there. I had no clue what that was. I didnâ&#128;&#152;t understand what that was. They sent me very&#13;
quickly to the Executive Development Program. I had a ball; most exciting, stimulating,&#13;
intellectually fascinating learning in a long time. I loved it. I had a great time. Did I learn&#13;
anything that helped me be a better manager? No. I learned a lot of things about development,&#13;
about finance, about change, about a number of things, but not a lot about what I needed to do&#13;
day in and day out with my people.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Yeah. You learned more the technical/operational side?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Exactly. So I would say it was a bit bumpy. Main change challenges for me&#13;
were to shift my mindset from one of task manager to one of people manager, from one of&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
designing a sector strategy on a country to now handling a whole sector in a large number of&#13;
countries. It is a very different mindset, a different set of skills that are called for. I was very&#13;
fortunate that my director at the time was Xavier Coll and he quickly gave me a coach, and I&#13;
discovered that there were tons of things I had no clue about or didnâ&#128;&#152;t know. This was very, very&#13;
helpful to start articulating and understanding the implications of the management job. And I&#13;
learned a number of kind of obvious things, I think, and became very conscious and aware of&#13;
how to do things so that people actually follow you.&#13;
&#13;
I was very lucky to have had fantastic staff in my group. I discovered at the time the power of&#13;
leadership and management in terms of having extremely skilled people and realizing that&#13;
motivation, collaboration, contributing to something greater than your own self interest, was&#13;
something that created the kind of energy and the kind of creativity and innovation that I hadnâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
seen before.&#13;
&#13;
I was very fortunate, also, at the time, that the sector I was responsible for, social protection, had&#13;
a very good Director in the anchor, Robert Holzmann. Actually, Robert Holzmann and the social&#13;
protection sector board was the only sector board that received top marks from the QAG (Quality&#13;
Assurance Group) evaluation sector boards. This was an extraordinarily good sector board that&#13;
worked the way it was intended.&#13;
&#13;
The SM [sector manager] job also represented a challenge because I was experiencing the worst&#13;
tensions in the matrix. I was this time fully sitting in a sector unit that served six country&#13;
management units who all thought their countries were the top priority, that they need to get top&#13;
everything, every time, all the time, at no cost, et cetera. So, it was very challenging that way as&#13;
well. And I learned that I couldnâ&#128;&#152;t anymore manage everything by myself. That I had to&#13;
delegate, which meant I had to trust my people. I canâ&#128;&#152;t delegate if I donâ&#128;&#152;t trust. And to trust&#13;
people and for them to trust you, you have to do a lot of things and have discussions about a&#13;
huge number of things and agree on where you are going, what are you doing and why, and what&#13;
are the parameters of your actions, et cetera. It forced me to figure out how to deal with, you&#13;
know, six competing clients here who you had to satisfy and make them want your services.&#13;
&#13;
I got the Best Manager Award from the Staff Association when I was a sector manager. I&#13;
personally could not believe it. You know, whatâ&#128;&#152;s the big deal here? But now I realize it was&#13;
really wonderful. It was a very nice acknowledgement from my staff that they valued the time&#13;
actually I invested in them, that they valued the time we invested together in learning and&#13;
figuring out ways to do a better job.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Which component in social protection did you find needing the most focus in Latin&#13;
America and the Caribbean region at that time?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Well, at the time that I became a sector manager, Latin America was pretty&#13;
much getting out of the structural adjustment period. Countries were doing much better than in&#13;
the â&#128;&#151;80sâ&#128;&#148;they were growing and so onâ&#128;&#148;however, it continued to be the most unequal region in&#13;
the world, and that was why I believed human development in general and social protection in&#13;
particular had to play a key role. Given that Latin America continues to this day to be the most&#13;
unequal region in the world and that, therefore, the access to basic services is extremely unequal&#13;
&#13;
                                    Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                                December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and that the poor groups have standards of living comparable to countries that are of much lower&#13;
income levels, gave us a huge agenda for intervention.&#13;
&#13;
Many of the countries actually were spending quite a lot of money on human development:&#13;
education, health, pensions, welfare. However, when you look at what they were doing you&#13;
found a number of issues, the key ones, where the incidences of those expenditures, those who&#13;
benefited from them were not the people who really needed them. That was the first point. And,&#13;
second, they were using a number of instruments that were not very efficient. For example, they&#13;
were using in-kind transfers as opposed to cash. So for us in social protection, developing a&#13;
framework for the analysis of social expenditures, in particular social protection expenditures,&#13;
was essential to be able to have conversations with governments to see how well they were&#13;
doing, not only in terms of levels, but allocation of resources and so on, and also introducing the&#13;
concept of the impact of this spending on poverty levels.&#13;
&#13;
So we developed a number of tools, using the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s first social protection strategy approach&#13;
(managing social risk). And that was very instrumental for us as the basis to do diagnostics for&#13;
the countries. So part of the work we did in the group, you know, while working in different&#13;
countries, was to have similar templates, similar approaches to the analysis. And that was very,&#13;
very, helpful because we could basically compare and show countries, you know, â&#128;&#149;While you&#13;
have fifteen million children between the ages of zero and five, of those children ten million are&#13;
in extreme poverty, and of those ten million only one million receives benefits from your X, Y&#13;
and Z programs. All the others donâ&#128;&#152;t. And at the same time you have this huge transfer program&#13;
for this other group that needs it less.â&#128;&#150; We also used evaluations showing them what things work&#13;
and what things didnâ&#128;&#152;t work. And, this was very much developed in conjunction with public&#13;
expenditure reviews that we did together with the PREM [Poverty Reduction and Economic&#13;
Management Network] folks. I loved that work. That was fun. That was very, very interesting.&#13;
And many times we did not get anywhere with some governments.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: No political will?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: No. Nor power, nor enough political capital to make changes, so it was very&#13;
interesting, and I think we made major progress and actually did; overall approaches that we&#13;
developed were very much adopted by the Inter-American Development Bank as well.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Your approaches at the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Oh, yeah, which we worked on together in a number of countries. It was that&#13;
friendly competition. But as long as they invested in the same things we wanted them to invest,&#13;
that was just fine.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: In January of â&#128;&#152;99, then President [James D.] Wolfensohn proposed the adoption of the&#13;
CDF (Comprehensive Development Framework), a holistic model of development emphasizing&#13;
country ownership of the development agenda, as a new way for the Bank to do its business.&#13;
How did the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s adoption of the CDF principles impact social investment and development&#13;
in Latin America and, more specifically, your own endeavors at the time?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                               December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Yeah, well, you know, at the timeâ&#128;&#148;actually, Bolivia was the first country&#13;
where the CDF was implemented, with Isabel Guerrero as the CD [country director]. And I&#13;
think it was a crucial recognition that there was more to development than just growth and about&#13;
the importance of putting all these things together. But at the same time it was also a recognition&#13;
that country ownership--the Bank following the countries as opposed to the countries following&#13;
the Bank--was really the most important principle. The articulation of the principles of the CDF&#13;
was instrumental to put all these things together. At the same time, the CDF experience was a&#13;
good example of how poorly this organization implements new ideas. I donâ&#128;&#152;t think there were&#13;
major or significant efforts to make sure that everyone in Operations that should have mastered&#13;
the concepts and really be familiar with this and so on . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: It wasnâ&#128;&#152;t well operationalized.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: It wasnâ&#128;&#152;t well implemented. And so it remained very much in Bolivia and a&#13;
few other countries taking a few elements because the rest of the Organization didnâ&#128;&#152;t transfer&#13;
authority and power which was intended in the first place if you want the countries to have&#13;
ownership. A couple of heroes took it on and tried. We see it work. It doesnâ&#128;&#152;t get&#13;
mainstreamed and fades away. Now, like everything, nothing is either/or in this place and a&#13;
number of the CDF things were picked up in CASs [Country Assistance Strategy], PRSPs&#13;
[Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper]. I guess it is just the way this Organization operates.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: So how well developed, in your view, are the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s various instruments, the ones you&#13;
mentioned, like the CAS, PRSPâ&#128;&#152;s, and the HIPC [highly indebted poor country]?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: I think they are perfectly fine as instruments. The issue is a different issue.&#13;
Itâ&#128;&#152;s: How do you implement country ownership? How do you implement/plan engagements?&#13;
What do you mean by increasing strategic focus? Thatâ&#128;&#152;s where I think the issues are. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
where we fail, over and over and over again. So I think they are fantastic instruments. How they&#13;
are used, thatâ&#128;&#152;s another story. Something I remember Mr. Wolfensohn at the end of his tenure&#13;
used to say, â&#128;&#149;There is a best example boutique in this organization for everything.â&#128;&#150; But itâ&#128;&#152;s a&#13;
boutique. Why is it that it doesnâ&#128;&#152;t get scaled up? Why is it that the exception and not the norm?&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Moving on to another of your promotions, in January of â&#128;&#152;02 you were promoted to&#13;
Sector Director, Human Development, Latin America and the Caribbean. Please discuss how&#13;
this came about, what priorities did you set for yourself in light of much broader oversight&#13;
responsibilities, and what challenges did you face in a region that is marked by high social&#13;
inequality and prone to crises and volatility including unexpected afflictions such as natural&#13;
disasters with no buffers protecting the poor against the hardships facing them?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: At the time I had two bosses, David De Ferranti and Jo [Jozef M.] Ritzen. At&#13;
the time Jo Ritzen was the VP [vice president] for Human Development for the Network. The&#13;
first piece was to understand and address why Latin America with its MICs [middle income&#13;
countries] had such deficient social indicators and services for their poor populations. The&#13;
second part was looking at what our clients were interested in or not interested in, the program&#13;
we had, and what the CMUs [country management units] wanted from our sector. So, the first&#13;
thing I did was to actually interview on video tape all the country directors, the sector directors,&#13;
&#13;
                                    Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                                December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the chief economist, and the RVP [regional vice president] and asked them, â&#128;&#149;What do you think&#13;
of LCSHD [Latin America and Caribbean Region Sector Unit, Human Development]? How are&#13;
we doing? And, what do you think are the opportunities and potential for us in the Region?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
And I got answers ranging from, â&#128;&#149;Oh, you are all very nice people, but totally incompetent,â&#128;&#150; to&#13;
â&#128;&#149;I should get all your businessâ&#128;&#150; . .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: They said that?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Oh yeah. Yeah. The best observations were, â&#128;&#149;Well, this is a region that really&#13;
needs to invest in its people as the central part of their strategy and that was absent in the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
strategies.â&#128;&#150; To make it short, I basically realized that either we figured out where we were going&#13;
to make a difference in this region or really we shouldnâ&#128;&#152;t be employed.&#13;
&#13;
So that was my main challenge: how to demonstrate, one, that there was a role for the Bank in&#13;
human development in a region of MICs and, second, figure out what that role was, given that&#13;
neither the country side nor anybody else actually thought much about us. So it was a very&#13;
interesting challenge.&#13;
&#13;
How did we go about it? I think at the time, with a couple of years under my belt in being a&#13;
sector manager, I had developed a pretty healthy respect for management skills, the importance&#13;
of leadership and so on. And I knew that the staff in my group were pretty capable people.&#13;
Maybe I had a few skills mix issues. However, I needed to get a spark, get something moving, to&#13;
get this group to really play at a different level. You know, â&#128;&#149;good enoughâ&#128;&#150; and â&#128;&#149;business as&#13;
usualâ&#128;&#150; was not enough, and that was something that I was very clear on from the very beginning.&#13;
&#13;
I went to IFC [International Finance Corporation] and talked to Dorothy Berry because I had&#13;
seen that Peter Woicke had already made a number of pretty important changes and they were&#13;
starting to turn around a declining business. And she basically got me in touch with the same&#13;
management consultants that they used in IFC (Dialogos). And I brought them in. In the&#13;
beginning, it was an extremely difficult exercise, because for the first time I realized that I had&#13;
always thought about management as something you do to others and I had never thought that I&#13;
was part of the equation, personally. When you talk about shifting a department and raising the&#13;
game and the standards and so on, itâ&#128;&#152;s an endeavor that involves people personally to a very&#13;
significant extent. It involved a leadership team that truly needed to be motivated and inspired,&#13;
believe, craft a common set of goals and values and principles and so on. I didnâ&#128;&#152;t know anything&#13;
about this, but I realized that either we had a vision and a different set of goals to pursue or we&#13;
shouldnâ&#128;&#152;t have the jobs we had. Actually, we had a hundred-twenty people, and we were&#13;
delivering pretty much very little for this organization and for the region itself. So the priority&#13;
we set out was to be the best human development department in the World Bank and to provide&#13;
the best support to our countries in human development.&#13;
&#13;
How would we know we were succeeding? We would have a demand that would go to the roof.&#13;
Thatâ&#128;&#152;s what we wanted. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s what I set out to do, basically, and why? Because if we did well,&#13;
the face of poverty in Latin America would look very different in the future, and that was that.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: And how did that evolve? Did you accomplish what you set out to do?&#13;
&#13;
                                    Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                                December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Actually, we did. Well, there was this first difficult part where we realized&#13;
that, if we wanted the department to change and our people to operate in different ways and be&#13;
more client oriented, raise their standards of quality, manage to handle the bureaucratic obstacles&#13;
and so on, we needed to change ourselves. We needed to lead by example. Otherwise, it is very&#13;
hard for staff to imagine or even understand what you are talking about. And that was&#13;
extraordinarily difficult. And actually my management team changed significantly in that period&#13;
because there were people who just declined the opportunity of operating in a different way.&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#152;m extraordinarily grateful, actually, to David De Ferranti in particular, because he gave all the&#13;
space for us to try different things.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: What impact did a greatly decentralized Bank, begun under the Strategic Compact&#13;
implemented in â&#128;&#152;97, with almost one third of its total workforce in field offices, have on your&#13;
endeavors? Did that help you?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Yes and no. You know, Latin America is the least decentralized region in the&#13;
Bank for obvious reasons. Weâ&#128;&#152;re very close, same time zone, et cetera. At the same time, all but&#13;
two country departments are decentralized in the field. From a sector perspective, and this was&#13;
actually part of some of the major restructuring efforts that I put in place in my own units, which&#13;
meant that in order to be able to provide the adequate kind of service at the levels required, with&#13;
the quality required in terms of skills and so on, to the different country departments, the way&#13;
you need to manage that is very different than the way we have today. So, while countries would&#13;
benefit enormously from having senior people in Human Development in the countries, there&#13;
were programs in those countries sometimes that didnâ&#128;&#152;t allow you to do that. If you do not have&#13;
enough work program to cover the cost of those, you canâ&#128;&#152;t do it.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: So itâ&#128;&#152;s budgetary?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Of course. There are major constraints in the way we do the budgeting in the&#13;
Bank in terms of how it determines your business decisions. One of the things that came out of&#13;
these discussions was that the region agreed that for decentralized staff, the overheads, some of&#13;
the indirects and all those things, would be covered regionally so that sector units would not have&#13;
huge disincentive to send people to the field. As a result, I did decentralize a number of people&#13;
to some key strategic places. Brazil was one of them. And Iâ&#128;&#152;m extraordinarily pleased by the&#13;
result of that. The whole Conditional Cash transfers Program that the Bank keeps talking about&#13;
is the result pretty much of having done that, having put superbly qualified Bank staff in the field&#13;
so that we could work with the newly elected Brazilian government (Lulaâ&#128;&#152;s [Luis Inacio Lula da&#13;
Silva] first term) and be there on time, all the time, when they are discussing their reforms and&#13;
have a huge impact.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: In your opinion, how well has decentralization worked in bringing the Bank closer to&#13;
its clients and in promoting greater policy dialogue?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: In my own experience that has been a major gain. Iâ&#128;&#152;ve seen places where it has&#13;
had a major impact and worked very well, like the example I just gave you in Brazil. But Iâ&#128;&#152;ve&#13;
also seen cases where nothing happened. And it is not only the interest of one particular person.&#13;
&#13;
                                    Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                                December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Itâ&#128;&#152;s the whole Bank team: country director and everybody else in there. But potentially itâ&#128;&#152;s the&#13;
only way to go. The world is moving . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: How do you look back on your accomplishments as Sector Director in Latin America&#13;
and the Caribbean? And how well positioned, in your opinion, is the Region to meeting the&#13;
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set to halving poverty by 2015?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: I gave you a whole set of materials about the work and the new business model&#13;
we developed in LCSHD which allowed the group actually to move from being pretty much the&#13;
dog in the region to being the best department in the region. And in three years we went from a&#13;
billion in lending to almost two and a half billion in lending and from twenty percent of the&#13;
lending in LAC to forty-five percent of the lending in the LAC region and pretty much almost&#13;
half of the HD lending in the Bank. To me, the reason we managed to move from a position of a&#13;
declining to a booming business was very much the changes we made to our business model; the&#13;
way we serve our clients to the focus on quality, client responsiveness, partnerships,&#13;
collaboration across the board and so on.&#13;
&#13;
When I look at that experience, I realize that the Bank can play a huge role in middle-income&#13;
countries. I have no doubt about it. You have value added. You have to figure out what it is,&#13;
and itâ&#128;&#152;s not the same everywhere. And if a department like mine with one hundred and twenty&#13;
people could do that, to a large extent with the same people we had in the beginning, you can do&#13;
it anywhere.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: How well positioned is the LAC region, in your opinion, to meeting the Millennium&#13;
Development Goals?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: You know, the discussion of the Millennium Development Goals in LAC had a&#13;
different focus than it had in regions like Africa or South Asia. On average many of the LAC&#13;
countries are not doing badly, and theyâ&#128;&#152;re pretty okay. So the fundamental part of our work was&#13;
to basically break down the Millennium Development Goals on the targets and the indicators&#13;
within countries to demonstrate again the issue of inequality and so on.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, we looked into these targets with much less focus in the specific indicator or the&#13;
particular target but more in terms of the goal that they entail. I would not think that anybody in&#13;
Latin America would agree with you or with the Bank that having universal primary education is&#13;
good enough for a set of middle-income countries; it is not. So in that regard, you know, the&#13;
Millennium Development Goals did not really fit very well the way they were defined in the&#13;
reality of Latin America. At the same time, they were very helpful because they pointed to the&#13;
importance of results to basically ensure that your policy dialogue focuses on outcomes as&#13;
opposed to processes, projects, or whatever. Interestingly enough, one piece of work that came&#13;
out of this, which is the one two of my staff did on the progress among the indigenous&#13;
populations in the region in terms of the MDGs, and there you realized that while the averages&#13;
have improved significantly, these populations have remained behind, big time.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Okay. Would you like to break for this morning and then we can tackle your Director&#13;
position in HR this afternoon?&#13;

                                       Washington, D.C.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Good afternoon. This is Marie Zenni and Iâ&#128;&#152;m back again at World Bank headquarters&#13;
for my second and final interview session with Ms. Arriagada. Welcome again, Ms. Arriagada.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Iâ&#128;&#152;d like to begin where we left off this morning discussing your role as Sector Director&#13;
in the Latin America and Caribbean region. Is there anything more you wish to add to that&#13;
before we move on to your next assignment?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: You know, actually, yes. Iâ&#128;&#152;m not sure I articulated properly what the job&#13;
entailed and the learning that I gathered from that, which I think would be important to capture&#13;
here. The first part is to realize the disconnect between being the World Bank in a middle-&#13;
income country region, have a shrinking portfolio with a very weak pipeline, and not a large&#13;
demand from work from your country departments. At the same time, you realize you are in a&#13;
region that has some of the worst human development indicators in the world in a number of&#13;
groups, particularly indigenous groups, isolated indigenous communities of rural areas, et cetera.&#13;
So there was a big tension between, one, having real needs in the countries and having a&#13;
department that was not delivering. So the major challenge was to basically look into the mirror&#13;
very clearly and start looking at why this happened, what is it we are doing here that we could be&#13;
doing differently. And to me, thinking together as a department and particularly as a&#13;
management team was an extraordinarily important phase for us to start acknowledging what&#13;
were the issues. And, as I mentioned this morning, we interviewed a lot of the people who&#13;
worked with us and used our services and were really clear that we were not up to par, that we&#13;
were not meeting the standards. We had a huge amount of skepticism as a major driver of&#13;
behavior, both for our staff but also within the management team: â&#128;&#149;You canâ&#128;&#152;t change anything.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
â&#128;&#149;You canâ&#128;&#152;t do anything.â&#128;&#150; â&#128;&#149;The Bank this, the countries that,â&#128;&#150; et cetera. We did not really own&#13;
what was happening in the department. We were pretty much blaming it in a set of causes that&#13;
we put on everybody else except us.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: That were put on or that you put on?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: That we put on. We would say, â&#128;&#149;Oh well, there isnâ&#128;&#152;t any demand for HD&#13;
because all the country directors are country economists and therefore they donâ&#128;&#152;t care for human&#13;
development.â&#128;&#150; Or, you know, â&#128;&#149;The countries do not really want to borrow for human&#13;
development. They would much rather borrow for infrastructure.â&#128;&#150; All the reasons were outside&#13;
of us, that we had no power to do anything, we were not responsible. And the first big&#13;
recognition was to realize what we could actually influence and change and do differently&#13;
ourselves. And to me, that was a very critical shift in my own mind--in terms of how to manage&#13;
a place and how to lead people--in what leadership and management is.&#13;
&#13;
The second phase, once we assumed responsibility for what is and is not working well, then you&#13;
can start thinking in a very different way, in how you are going to get out of the hole youâ&#128;&#152;re in&#13;
&#13;
                                   Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                               December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
because now you realize you have a lot of options and possibilities and there are many things&#13;
that you can do. And for us that second part, if I had to summarize it in one way, I would want&#13;
to say we actually took responsibility for having a mediocre department, for having a department&#13;
that actually wasnâ&#128;&#152;t very good. And by doing that, actually it gave us a lot of freedom to, one,&#13;
connect very clearly to the purpose we were in the Bank, to make a difference and to really have&#13;
an impact in the countries in human development, to be less burdened by the way things were&#13;
and think much more forward looking in terms of what we needed to do, to stop blaming&#13;
anybody including ourselves, to look ahead in what we needed. It was a lot less important to say&#13;
who was wrong and who was right and it was a lot more productive and we were much more&#13;
focused in what we needed to do.&#13;
&#13;
And basically, once we managed to be clear in what were our vision and objectives in the&#13;
countries then align everything else around, it was actually easier. I found it quite simple to put&#13;
all the systems and the processes and practices around very clear objectives that everybody buys&#13;
into. For us that entails--and I think for any sector in the Bank, operating in the current matrix--&#13;
key pieces that we needed to change were budget management because budget management, the&#13;
way it is set up or has been set up, is not geared towards collaboration, towards team work,&#13;
towards flexibility, so we changed that. There is no structure aligning support for teams, for the&#13;
task teams that face the clients. And we spoke a little bit about decentralization in the morning&#13;
and decided you have to pay the price, even if it is financially a very big burden, for having&#13;
people with the clients in your most strategic places. Thereâ&#128;&#152;s just no other way to operate.&#13;
&#13;
And once you sort of get clear on what are things that are not working and that you need to do,&#13;
then the job is pretty easy. You just need to figure out how you get there. And for us it entailed&#13;
to basically alter the way we staff our teams, the way we organize teams and put them together&#13;
multi-sectorally to eliminate conflicts to streamline the focus of management and to have a very&#13;
flexible system to deploy staff. People are in the sectors, our health specialists and poverty&#13;
economists or educators, and they are tied to their sectors but they want to do a job in a concrete&#13;
place, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s a country. So when you put them together with other experts, working around&#13;
real problems in a real country is when their juices and creativity and everything else really get&#13;
going.&#13;
&#13;
So that for us was kind of the central question, and we redefined all the roles and functions in the&#13;
department, including my role, in the function of the job that needed to be done. You know:&#13;
Will this get us there or not? Is this a constraint or not? Does this matter, or it doesnâ&#128;&#152;t? And&#13;
anything that didnâ&#128;&#152;t matter or was a constraint, we removed it. We removed everything we could&#13;
within the realm of a department and created HD country teams that put together the sectors:&#13;
social protection, education, and health. Every team had a senior person, and we could balance&#13;
them to have the mentoring and the seniority that you need and make sure that every group had&#13;
an economist and every group had an operations specialist and so on, so that our services to the&#13;
countries were seamlessly across sectors. For example, we simplified a lot of the work around&#13;
procurement and financial management by working across the sectors so all of our projects&#13;
would have the same framework and things of that sort.&#13;
&#13;
What brought a huge amount of buy-in from staff was the fact that in the structuring of the HD&#13;
country teams one of the principles was to make sure that nobody was spread too thin in too&#13;
&#13;
                                    Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                                December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
many different countries, balancing competencies and opportunities within the HD country&#13;
teams, and finally total empowerment of the country teams to move money around in different&#13;
tasks within the same CMU. People were absolutely responsive to the greater empowerment and&#13;
freedom.&#13;
&#13;
The other thing we did was create a pool of support services for all the task teams facing clients,&#13;
pooling all the repetitive functions that are the same across, you know, making copies, running&#13;
errands, going over to pick up visas, passports for trips, preparing requests for consultant&#13;
services, feeding administration systems that can be done better by people who only do those&#13;
things. We centralized them and created a business center. This created great will among staff&#13;
because it freed up the time of both ACS [administrative and client support] and professional&#13;
staff to focus on their tasks, to interface with their clients and do the technical work theyâ&#128;&#152;re here&#13;
for as opposed getting paid for pushing papers. Once we had staff actually excited about that . .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Motivated.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Motivated. The amount of ideas and the amount of innovation and work that&#13;
the people in the department came up with was pretty unbelievable to me. I still could not&#13;
articulate exactly what happened. But I did realize is that when you provide people with the&#13;
environment and the right incentives, they respond.&#13;
&#13;
The other big thing there was that the leadership team and the management team basically&#13;
transformed itself into something else. First, it stopped being at the top of the organization. I&#13;
mean, it went to the bottom of the organization, basically to give people the signal that their job&#13;
was to support them in working with clients. And in the definition of functions we moved away&#13;
from the official titles to basically focus on what were the functions that would support the task&#13;
teams to deliver top quality products and services for the countries. That was the key thing. And&#13;
we ended up having people focusing on quality enhancements, technical quality enhancements,&#13;
operational quality enhancements, on partnerships, people making sure that all the alliances we&#13;
needed both inside the Bank as a unit, as well as other organizations, was done well.&#13;
&#13;
Latin America is a region where there is a crisis or a major earthquake or a hurricane or&#13;
something every year; we needed to have a rapid response team ready to roll anytime, all the&#13;
time so that the rest of the department could continue working normally. We needed somebody&#13;
to focus on conflict management and in a group of a hundred and twenty people youâ&#128;&#152;re bound to&#13;
have all kinds of conflicts and so on, so somebody worked on the people conflict. Another group&#13;
was led by the lead economist on knowledge generation and new products and services, basically&#13;
scanning the universe for the knowledge that was being generated outside the Bank to bring it in&#13;
to our teams. And this is what allowed us to grow the business to basically become the coolest&#13;
place to work in. Besides it was a fun place. Even now I keep reading things that the HD group&#13;
in LAC has done. IEG [Independent Evaluation Group] gave the department an award for being&#13;
the first department in the Bank to have a very systematic strategy to evaluate the impact of key&#13;
HD interventions. That was two years ago, you know. A couple of our staff put together a&#13;
proposal to assess what was happening with indigenous populations with regards to the&#13;
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). A book ended up being published outside the Bank&#13;
because the interest that this work generated in the region was so large.&#13;
&#13;
                                    Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                                December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: What about results on the ground in terms of feedback?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: I think the LAC HD group is probably one of the few departments in the Bank&#13;
who has evaluated many programs so it can show the impact--positive, negative or none--of a&#13;
number of its projects. On my own part, I got plenty of feedback, including recognition from the&#13;
government of El Salvador in 2006 for having supported them in this program that started&#13;
community managed schools 15 years ago and that has changed the face of education in this&#13;
country.&#13;
&#13;
So, the key principles were quite simple. The clientsâ&#128;&#152; work was first for everyone, and that&#13;
included me as a director. So if it was a choice between some internal thing and answering a&#13;
question from a client country or solving an operational problem in their project, the client was&#13;
first for absolutely everybody in the place, and that was a principle everyone bought in.&#13;
&#13;
The second was really focusing on the outcomes of the programs and projects that we were&#13;
involved in and really not being very concerned about direct attribution, that, â&#128;&#149;I did thisâ&#128;&#150; or&#13;
â&#128;&#149;This is my project.â&#128;&#150; No. It was about the countries, about the agencies in the countries, and&#13;
about getting things done.&#13;
&#13;
The next one was investing in very high quality analytical work. That was absolutely central to&#13;
have and bring in the technical skills and the knowledge that you needed to be listened to.&#13;
&#13;
The next element was building very, very, strong relationships with the client. We emphasized&#13;
that when it comes to the development programs and working together with the countries, we are&#13;
their partner. We are not there to tell them what to do. We are there to work together with them,&#13;
problem solve together with them, and find solutions that work for them. At the end of the day,&#13;
it will be their money; they are going to have to pay it back. And theyâ&#128;&#152;re the ones living with the&#13;
solutions, implementing them, not us. We just show up twice a year to supervise (if they are&#13;
lucky to get good supervision).&#13;
&#13;
The next big element was to break the silos in HD and basically leverage the resources of the&#13;
whole department. And itâ&#128;&#152;s a lot easier to optimize and find economies of scale and make things&#13;
more efficient at that level, but you reach a point where you canâ&#128;&#152;t grow anymore, where you&#13;
need the rest of the organization because you need fresh ideas, fresh examples, other experiences&#13;
and other people to interact with to enrich what you are doing and your views. We realized we&#13;
needed the rest of HD, we needed the rest of LAC, and we needed the rest of the Bank,&#13;
particularly East Asia, ECA [Europe and Central Asia Region], you know, the more middle-&#13;
income country regions, because those are the ones where our country-client issues are more&#13;
relevant, more directly connected, and so on. That wasnâ&#128;&#152;t there. So we were very much playing&#13;
alone&#13;
&#13;
Another big challenge was to realize that the beast was alive and well. Jim [James W.] Adams&#13;
was a speaker in every one of my retreats. We invited him to every one of them to take&#13;
advantage of every single instrument modernization he promoted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                                December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Weâ&#128;&#152;re talking when he was in OPCS [Operations Policy and Country Services]?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: OPCS, yeah. DPLs (Development Policy Loans), we started them,&#13;
programmatic loans, sectoral adjustment loans, you name it, we picked up on every single&#13;
possible innovation, simplification and so on of the instruments that he promoted. However, the&#13;
amount of work that it took to get any of the new ideas and new things through the bureaucracy&#13;
in this Bank was just absolutely unbelievable, unbelievable.&#13;
&#13;
I still recall what was one of the last things I did as a sector director: Education For All, FDIs&#13;
[foreign direct investment], Guyana. Guyana is a small country, less than a million people, and&#13;
there was this issue of the grant that needed to be established. And between the Trust Fund&#13;
people, the Legal people, the Budget people, and everyone who needed to be involved in these&#13;
things we were going nowhere, absolutely no where. It took getting Jim Adams himself&#13;
involved to solve this issue, for a tiny country and a minor issue.&#13;
&#13;
Creating this new instrument was helpful, but the rest has not disappeared; itâ&#128;&#152;s there. The&#13;
internal processes keep taking too much time, so we miss opportunities, big time opportunities,&#13;
for business development, for innovation and for working with the external partners, huge time.&#13;
My worst job was the job of director. It still is the worst job ever.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Director . . .&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Any Director. Because youâ&#128;&#152;re busy, you are so busy with the internal stuff that&#13;
you have very little time for business development, the reasons you are here in the first place.&#13;
Another big challenge is sticking to the principles and not giving in to spreading people too thin.&#13;
You know, the demands and the push and the pressure from the country directors and the gaming&#13;
between, â&#128;&#149;Iâ&#128;&#152;ll give you a budget,â&#128;&#150; or â&#128;&#149;I donâ&#128;&#152;t give you a budget, but I need to get Mr. X or Ms.&#13;
Y, and I donâ&#128;&#152;t like Mr. C or Mrs.â&#128;&#150; And finally, time and resources for learning, to me that was&#13;
another huge constraint from a sector department point of view. I had what was supposed to be&#13;
the equivalent of two staff weeks, and that could go just so far into making sure you have the&#13;
people with the language mastery that you need and the basics but not really for developing your&#13;
people.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: As Director, Leadership, Organizational Effectiveness, and Strategic Staffing&#13;
(HRSLO) in the Human Resources Vice-Presidency--you became that in January of 2005--&#13;
youâ&#128;&#152;ve already talked a little to the circumstances leading to your move, and Iâ&#128;&#152;m sure you want&#13;
to add more. Why do you think you were chosen for this assignment, and what in your previous&#13;
experience do you think prepared you for it?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Yes. A very important thing that happened was that I was appointed as one of&#13;
the chairs for the Organizational Effectiveness Task Force. That was what Shengman Zhang had&#13;
put together before Mr. Wolfensohn left. I think the reason that David De Ferranti, who at the&#13;
time was the RVP, and Shengman asked me to work on that was that I was already touching the&#13;
limits on what I could do in my region and my sector, so I was pushing very hard, maybe too&#13;
hard, my regional vice-president, my colleagues in HD and so on to improve the way we did&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                                December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
things here. And at the time, I guess, I was very high with the success that we had had in&#13;
LCSHD, so I said, â&#128;&#149;This is really easy.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Itâ&#128;&#152;s an extension of what you were doing.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Exactly. And it was, and in the OETF, where I started to be absolutely&#13;
fascinated by this organization, how it works or does not work, and I guess I translated my&#13;
passion and my energy to this. Can you imagine what it would be like if the Bank worked the&#13;
same way in general, not as an exception but as the norm, as the standard? When you have an&#13;
excellent task team delivering for a client and the client knows that what they are doing is just&#13;
fantastic, one, the amount of satisfaction is just absolutely unbelievable, but second, I see no&#13;
reason why that should not be the standard for this organization. I figured, â&#128;&#149;There are five&#13;
hundred managers in the Bank, and,â&#128;&#150; I figured, â&#128;&#149;everyone can do this.â&#128;&#150; And it was fascinating to&#13;
me to think that other managers would want to play and lead their staff to do extraordinary work.&#13;
So thatâ&#128;&#152;s how I ended up there.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: As director HRSLO, what were your main responsibilities and the challenges you&#13;
faced in tackling your mandate, and what did you set up to accomplish? You must have had a&#13;
hefty mandate.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Well, yes. At the time HR actually had had in the past only a director for the&#13;
operational side of transactions and the HR management, personnel management and&#13;
administration. They did want to have somebody looking more at the organizational issues and&#13;
someone who came from the business, who could bring that perspective to HR. I was in charge&#13;
HRSLO, which is the unit in HR responsible for all the behavioral and management development&#13;
skills training for Bank managers and for Bank staff, for the recruitment and talent management&#13;
group, and for the analytics unit in HR. That was originally my mandate.&#13;
&#13;
We basically knew that HR and HR systems and policies were one of the incentive systems that&#13;
does not work very well, so the big job was to figure out what HR should look like for the future&#13;
Bank. What is it that the Bank business needs from HR in the future? And that was the main&#13;
objective of Xavier Coll, who was the VP for HR at the time. And that was the job he set out to&#13;
do with Aulikki Kuusela and this core team of people. That was what the HR renewal initiative&#13;
is all about.&#13;
&#13;
On the micro side, in terms of my own responsibility, HRSLO was a dysfunctional group. The&#13;
people in charge of organizational effectiveness had been a major problem for everybody,&#13;
apparently, in the past. They had been acquired, merged, moved around from the Strategic&#13;
Planning department to this other department, to HR. So my first job was to put some&#13;
management in this group and basically reduce the resources that were spent on all this.&#13;
&#13;
And then a few months later I was given an additional job which was the acting CLO . .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: The Chief Learning Officer.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Yes, the Chief Learning Officer.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                               December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: In the absence of hiring additionally . . .&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Yeah, upon the retirement of a prior CLO. So those were the things Iâ&#128;&#152;ve been&#13;
doing for the last two and a half years.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Staying within the issues that youâ&#128;&#152;re talking about, there continues to be discontent&#13;
among staff as to the role of HR in the Bank, mainly that there should not be an HR strategy but&#13;
an HR component integral to the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s overall business strategy, otherwise the Bank will&#13;
continue to lose its competitive edge as a lending institution as well as its ability to attract and&#13;
retain the right caliber staff to work on development. So, what are your thoughts on that?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Well, that statement could be the preface for the HR Renewal Proposal.&#13;
Basically, the business environment in which the Bank operates today calls for a huge amount of&#13;
flexibility, a huge amount of mobility, very fast paced moves and a lot of competition from other&#13;
players. The Bank used to be the only game in town and now we are not; we are a very minor&#13;
player in many places. This calls for a very different set-up of your HR policies and practices,&#13;
very, very different. And it requires that your policies and practices and procedures really follow&#13;
the business strategy which is flexibility, speed, mobility, global. When you start looking into&#13;
one of the issues and what is behind that, you realize--not being an HR professional but a user--&#13;
that many of the policies and systems have been done like a quilt patchwork where we have had&#13;
add-ons here and there that donâ&#128;&#152;t necessarily add up in a consistent and coherent way.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: What about benchmarking with other organizations?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Oh, tons of benchmarking, and it turns out that weâ&#128;&#152;re eight times more&#13;
expensive than comparable organizations, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
But to make the story short, the point is that you have this quilt, and these very complicated&#13;
arrangements. I will retire on Friday. I received a month ago an eighteen page memo, a&#13;
termination memo with all the things I need to do to leave the Bank. I think that is a beautiful&#13;
example of how complicated and cumbersome we make everything. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s one part of the HR&#13;
part of it. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s something that HR needs to fix and HR is willing to fix, and part of the HR&#13;
Renewal is precisely that. Itâ&#128;&#152;s a huge component on improving operations and systems and so&#13;
on, to basically make sure policies are consistent, to make sure systems speak with each other, to&#13;
make sure that exception is not the rule but an exception, to put transparency in the system so&#13;
that, for example, promotions are publicized, exceptions are publicized. So, if you work in ISG&#13;
[Information Solutions Group], whatever happens and decisions are made for you personally are&#13;
the same that are made in the last corner of the Bank in another vice presidency and you are not&#13;
learning from your friends that something else was done in somebody elseâ&#128;&#152;s case, you know.&#13;
&#13;
The other part has to do with the internal policies and contracts and so on and compensation.&#13;
What we need to be flexible, to be mobile, to attract the best kind of people, and to be able to&#13;
shift our skills-mix, thatâ&#128;&#152;s very, very complex. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s what we need. Today weâ&#128;&#152;re going back&#13;
into being involved in energy and having major issues to bring in top climate change people, and&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
we have tons of other people we donâ&#128;&#152;t need any more in the organization. So, how do you work&#13;
with that?&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: How does that reflect the new order?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Exactly.&#13;
&#13;
And then, there is a third part where all this gets connected to learning, to leadership, to&#13;
management and to performance and development. And this is where it is not about HR. HR&#13;
here is just an enabler; it provides the environment for this to operate. Basically, the people&#13;
making most, if not all, the management decisions about hiring, promotions, whatever it is, are&#13;
the managers. They hired, they promote, et cetera, et cetera. And there is a huge disconnect&#13;
between what you would want, you expect these people to do or what they actually do. If you&#13;
have people in charge of managing, make sure they manage and they are accountable for it. And&#13;
this is one of the key parts that is broken and why people criticize HR, which is not an entirely&#13;
fair criticism because HR cannot fix that alone. The Bank at this point has the best, top of the&#13;
line OPE [overall performance evaluation] system and form. Thereâ&#128;&#152;s nothing wrong with the&#13;
form. Thereâ&#128;&#152;s nothing wrong with the system. Itâ&#128;&#152;s how we apply it, or not apply it, and is not&#13;
the HR people who apply it. Itâ&#128;&#152;s us, the managers. There is this whole other aspect of this that&#13;
keeps things the way they are because it works to keep the status quo, to be able to have the&#13;
wiggle room you need to solve your unitâ&#128;&#152;s specific problems in the short run. But in the&#13;
aggregate this is dysfunctional. It is not taking this organization where it needs to be.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Based on your first-hand experience as Director (HRSLO), please discuss your overall&#13;
assessment of the systematic learning of lessons in the Bank as an input in the way the Bank does&#13;
its work, how conducive is its organizational culture to learning in general, and the specific role&#13;
you played therein in furthering progress.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: I sent you this morning a discussion note that I prepared; actually, this is my&#13;
last piece of work for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: â&#128;&#149;Issues in Staff Knowledge and Learning â&#128;&#147; Discussion Note,â&#128;&#150; dated November 8,&#13;
2007.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Yes. Where basically, based on the work that I have done in the last two and a&#13;
half years, both as the Director for HRSLO focusing on management development and staff&#13;
learning, on client engagement skills and team work skills, and the work that Iâ&#128;&#152;ve done as the&#13;
acting Chief Learning Officer for the Bank on the overall staff learning and knowledge&#13;
management program, all were the basis for this piece of work. This question and the issues&#13;
around the organizational culture and learning are at the core of what in my mind is the main&#13;
problem or issue that this organization faces today. It was as early as 1992, I think, The [Willi&#13;
W. A.] Wapenhans Report . .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Yes, it was. Just to give a bit of background for this report, soon after Louis Preston&#13;
became president in â&#128;&#152;91, he commissioned a task force to examine the quality of the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
portfolio, and make recommendations. This resulted in a landmark report in November â&#128;&#152;92,&#13;
&#13;
                                   Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                               December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
titled, â&#128;&#149;Effective Implementation: Key to Development Impact,â&#128;&#150; commonly known as â&#128;&#149;The&#13;
Wapenhans Report.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Yes. Well, one of the things which was clear at the time in the Wapenhans&#13;
Report already was that we really were not very good at learning from each other and from the&#13;
experiences we had in our own projects. I find that to be very true today. And this is part of the&#13;
analysis that we need here. What you see today, even after the Knowledge Bank was created in&#13;
1997 and a number of initiatives were put in place and so on, the fact of the matter remains that&#13;
while we do have some very good practices and some fantastic examples and some world class&#13;
things, they are the exception but they are not the rule. The standard is still inadequate. And, in&#13;
my mind, that is even more important today because we have more competitors. Countries today&#13;
do not have to come here to solve their issues. To get money, they can go to a lot of different&#13;
places. Therefore, what does the World Bank have to offer that they cannot buy elsewhere? In&#13;
my mind, that is the global experience in development that we have that nobody else has.&#13;
However, to a significant extent, this remains tacit knowledge in the heads of the staff, and weâ&#128;&#152;re&#13;
doing very little to ensure that this gets captured, shared and used, and reused by the&#13;
Organization. So we are sitting basically on this enormous human capital asset without&#13;
exploiting it properly. And I think that times are such that the external forces are more or less&#13;
going to leave us behind if we do not really step up to the plate.&#13;
&#13;
My biggest fear is that if the Wapenhans Report brought this up as early as 1992 as one&#13;
important constraint for our effectiveness at having a development impact, this is a deep rooted&#13;
issue in the culture of the organization. And I donâ&#128;&#152;t see that this issue is truly appreciated in the&#13;
Organization. And then I fear that the leadership needed to actually address it is not there. So, in&#13;
many discussions this is seen as, â&#128;&#149;Yes, yes, yes, the culture. And yes, weâ&#128;&#152;re not very good at&#13;
this, but this is intractable, thereâ&#128;&#152;s nothing we can do about it.â&#128;&#150; I disagree. I fundamentally&#13;
disagree because Iâ&#128;&#152;ve seen change in this organization, so I know you can do it. But I do not see&#13;
the leadership in senior management that would be needed to take on such a big thing.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Thereâ&#128;&#152;s no willingness or . . .&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Right. Well, if I had to describe it--and this is my personal view--&#13;
fundamentally, the business model of the Bank is obsolete. We are still operating for the most&#13;
part (and thatâ&#128;&#152;s the organizational culture and so on) in a world where we are the experts who&#13;
know about something; call it education, health, climate, water, sanitation, macro. We know it&#13;
and other people donâ&#128;&#152;t. Well, the unfortunate truth is that weâ&#128;&#152;re in the internet age; our clients&#13;
have access to pretty much the same information and knowledge that we do. As a matter of fact,&#13;
when you look at the counterparts that you deal with in the countries, they could be working at&#13;
the World Bank. They have very much similar knowledge and backgrounds as we do here. If&#13;
they have access to knowledge, we cannot come in there and just pontificate and preach and tell&#13;
them, you know, spread the wisdom of the word or something, because actually they can get in--&#13;
they can Google it today.&#13;
&#13;
What is it that we have to offer? And what we have to offer is the ability to share whatâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
happening in other countries, what worked in different settings, what were the lessons of X, Y,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                                December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and Z experiences, what are the pros and cons, what are the consequences, what are the costs, et&#13;
cetera. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s what we can provide.&#13;
&#13;
How does that fit with the current business model? Not very well, because if your job is&#13;
basically to push money out of the door and thatâ&#128;&#152;s how youâ&#128;&#152;re going to be evaluated and so on,&#13;
youâ&#128;&#152;re going to push money out the door, regardless. It may not be the right thing or the best&#13;
thing for the country, but it will certainly be what youâ&#128;&#152;re being rewarded for. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s one big&#13;
element of certain things that relates very directly to the incentive that we all face working in the&#13;
organization. There are no incentives for you to share your knowledge. Itâ&#128;&#152;s not rewarded, itâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
not recognized. Itâ&#128;&#152;s not an important part of your job.&#13;
&#13;
Last year after the OPE exercise, I looked at the ratings on the knowledge sharing item in the&#13;
OPE. Well, that was the highest rated items for everybody in the Bank. If we were so good at&#13;
that, people would be knocking at our doors, no? But thatâ&#128;&#152;s not really the case. There are big&#13;
constraints; leadership and the signaling from senior management is one of them.&#13;
&#13;
After the Knowledge Bank in â&#128;&#152;97 a number of initiatives were put in place. The concept has not&#13;
been revisited. There was a total vacuum and lack of interest during Mr. [Paul D.] Wolfowitzâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
period. Like everything else, first generation reforms created a new set of issues and a new set&#13;
of problems. The world out there is changing. Itâ&#128;&#152;s time to revisit.&#13;
&#13;
Parts of the issues have to do with the fact that the skills our staff need today to succeed out there&#13;
are changing, are different. And unless we are able to adapt, the Bank will not be doing very&#13;
well in the future unless some big crisis happens and everybody needs the World Bank and the&#13;
IMF [International Monetary Fund] again. But thatâ&#128;&#152;s a short term type of fix. But maybe thatâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
the way this organization chooses to limp along in the future. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s a possibility.&#13;
&#13;
The fact is that knowledge and learning are not part of the organizational culture. They are the&#13;
espoused, declared value, but theyâ&#128;&#152;re not practiced. In fact, they are not mainstreamed into&#13;
actual incentives and business processes. This is seen as just one more thing to do. It is only&#13;
very few groups of people who use knowledge and learning in a strategic way. There are good&#13;
examples; for example, the Doing Business program in the Private Sector Development group.&#13;
But they remain like islands, and theyâ&#128;&#152;re not mainstreamed.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Theyâ&#128;&#152;re operating in silos.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Everything is operating in silos. Fragmentation of decision-making is huge.&#13;
Everybody does their own thing. From my perspective as the CLO I see that more and more.&#13;
Itâ&#128;&#152;s just absolutely unbelievable. Everybody claims to be different from everybody else, and&#13;
therefore we have very different standards of quality for most things across the organization.&#13;
&#13;
And, when you look at the aggregate, you realize how the organization loses its edge. For&#13;
example, over a third of the staff in operations have not had any operational training even though&#13;
theyâ&#128;&#152;re working in operations. Thereâ&#128;&#152;s something wrong with that picture. And at the corporate&#13;
level these things are not being picked up as an organizational issue in a serious manner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                                December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I have very high hopes that in the future maybe there will be some more systematic and coherent&#13;
traction to this. Budget incentives are another big impediment. Operational rules are also a big&#13;
constraint. So, at the end of the day, you end up with people trying to do their best, personally,&#13;
individually, in a system that is not enabling them to do what they need to do, or the right thing,&#13;
or what would be the best quality or the best service for the client.&#13;
&#13;
The other thing that I could say on this is that it has been disappointing to work in management&#13;
development. There are very few people who actually want to lead. There are many people who&#13;
want a promotion, but not necessarily to be a leader. And . .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: A leader; i.e., manager?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: To me they are two different things. You can have a manager that administers&#13;
what is. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s perfectly fine in many jobs where thatâ&#128;&#152;s what you need. I would submit that&#13;
in the operational side, you donâ&#128;&#152;t need just managers. You need leaders. You need people with&#13;
vision, people with skills and abilities to strengthen the positioning of the Bank, the relevance of&#13;
the Bank and so on, to keep the organization and business in good health.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Technical leaders.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Technical leaders and people leaders, because at the end of the day . .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: They have to marry the two.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: . . they have to marry the two. We tend to think this is an either/or proposition,&#13;
and itâ&#128;&#152;s not. Organizations that succeed manage to balance the two, and we donâ&#128;&#152;t.&#13;
&#13;
And there are reasons these managers do not lead. One is the incentives that we already talked&#13;
about. People have a concern about their careers, about their pensions, about their own personal&#13;
progression. That is a legitimate concern; weâ&#128;&#152;re all concerned about those things.&#13;
&#13;
But the second one takes me again to the Wapenhans Report, and it is something that I have been&#13;
studying a bit from the CLO purely adult learning perspective, which is the kind of people we&#13;
bring into the organization. I have come to the conclusion that these deeply rooted issues can be&#13;
addressed to a significant extent by changing the incentive systems and by leadership from the&#13;
top--there is no question in my mind--but also that we need to really, really change our recruiting&#13;
practices in the organization. How do world class organizations recruit people today? They do&#13;
recruit people because they do have top notch technical skills, and they do recruit people who&#13;
have very good work experience. But they also check on people to make sure they do have the&#13;
right behavioral traits, that they are people who are interested in learning, that they are people&#13;
who can be wrong, that they are people who are okay with not knowing; that they are people&#13;
who collaborate well with others, et cetera, they have whatâ&#128;&#152;s being called emotional intelligence&#13;
as a key ingredient for them to operate in an organization. I truly think that in the long run, if&#13;
this place keeps recruiting like in the 1960â&#128;&#152;s, weâ&#128;&#152;re going to miss the boat big time. It is a&#13;
balance between technical skills, experience, emotional intelligence, and inter-personal skills that&#13;
is what weâ&#128;&#152;re missing. This is so much more important today than it was ten or fifteen years ago&#13;
&#13;
                                    Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
because the Bank clients today need to want to work with you. They donâ&#128;&#152;t have to work with&#13;
you anymore; they have to want you. And for them to want you, you have to be a good listener.&#13;
You have to be a good partner. You have to do a lot of things in a different way than weâ&#128;&#152;re used&#13;
to. And my biggest disappointment, actually, is that Iâ&#128;&#152;ve been unable to influence that in the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: What impact has the proliferation of fast-paced technological advancement taking&#13;
place worldwide have in accelerating and deepening the development process, how did this&#13;
impact your endeavors, and how well has the Bank harnessed these technological advancements&#13;
in achieving its strategic objectives?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Well, Iâ&#128;&#152;m very encouraged by what I see at the IT [information technology]&#13;
governance group that Guy De Poerck has put together, because of a number of things. The first&#13;
one is the clear acknowledgement that while the place has invested heavily and brought in all&#13;
kinds of tools and systems, we seem to think that the system will do the human part for you so&#13;
that you can avoid doing it. And, at this point, we find ourselves with about five staff per&#13;
website in the Bank. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s totally insane. If you do not provide people with the systems that&#13;
really serve them and respond to their needs, and with clear governance so that the process of&#13;
decision making and so on is clear and transparent, this is the result you have.&#13;
&#13;
Itâ&#128;&#152;s just natural that this happened. You know, people have developed all kinds of coping&#13;
mechanisms for things trying to do the best they can in their local situations. And the time is&#13;
past due--big time past due--to get some corporate alignment between the pieces of this very&#13;
fragmented organization while everybody does whatever they want. At the same time, the force&#13;
of technology can be very positive to force the business side of the house to make some choices&#13;
and standardize some basic processes and workflows across the organization. Raising the IT&#13;
questions, forces the business people to face the fact that we have six different ways to process&#13;
an appraisal document, et cetera, and that you have to have some common standard to be able to&#13;
share it and to get other people to find it. So, I donâ&#128;&#152;t know what else to say about that except that&#13;
I truly hope that this effort really moves forward and manages to get some corporate decision-&#13;
making done.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Do you want to talk about leadership in the Bank, particularly women and leadership&#13;
in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Yes. You know, I remember the first time I was appointed manager a male&#13;
colleague came and told me, â&#128;&#149;Oh, so you undermined such and such to get his job.â&#128;&#150; And I&#13;
remember at the time being extremely upset about that. And, looking at things, I think there has&#13;
been an enormous amount of progress made in the sense that you see a lot of women in the Bank&#13;
in senior positions in a way that were not there when I started. I remember when I joined a&#13;
region in the early â&#128;&#151;90s, I had been in a lot of places where I was the only woman or one of two&#13;
women, and that has changed. However, what I think is still very much the case is that for a&#13;
woman to move ahead, you need to work twice as hard. And this is a factor that deters many&#13;
women from pursuing higher positions or managerial positions even though they could be very&#13;
good at it.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Balancing family and career for women is still a difficult issue.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Thatâ&#128;&#152;s one part I think, yes. The other part, which is the other side of the coin,&#13;
I think, is the danger of going for targets that are going to basically mess up the career of people&#13;
who are pretty proficient, that theyâ&#128;&#152;re not ready for, without, you know, the enabling support and&#13;
so on thatâ&#128;&#152;s needed. Iâ&#128;&#152;ve seen that too.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: What would you like to see happen in that respect to promote opportunities for women&#13;
to progress in leadership positions? Based on your personal experience.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Based on my personal experience, I think whatâ&#128;&#152;s needed is good quality&#13;
leadership, whether it comes from male or female. And that is whatâ&#128;&#152;s missing. And that would&#13;
make the most for this organization. And I think those are people who have both very strong&#13;
technical skills but at the same time very high emotional intelligence as part of the way they&#13;
operate and they function. Working across and networking is how you do deals; it is how you&#13;
get things done; and it is how you motivate people to perform. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s what leadership is&#13;
about. So I think, to me, it is not a purely gender issue . .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Itâ&#128;&#152;s a quality issue.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: . . itâ&#128;&#152;s a quality of leadership issue and support for leadership. And I realize&#13;
that we spend a lot of resources in management development doing remedial work on people&#13;
who donâ&#128;&#152;t have the skills, the abilities, or the interest in actually being a good manager or being a&#13;
leader. Maybe that money would be better spent if we brought in the right people in the first&#13;
place. But to bring the right people in the first place we need to start much earlier. We need to&#13;
start with the people we bring into the organization. For example, if the President wants to see&#13;
more female diversity, you need to look at the overall pyramid of promotions through the grades,&#13;
right? Youâ&#128;&#152;re not going to get women in higher level, more women in higher level positions,&#13;
unless they start to rise through the ranks, correct? For that, you need to hire more women to&#13;
make it happen.&#13;
&#13;
Another thing is to facilitate the integration of managers that come from outside. You know, we&#13;
have very bad experience here. People come in senior positions or management positions in the&#13;
Bank and succeed for the most part, but then leave. What Iâ&#128;&#152;m talking about is when we have&#13;
brought in managers from the outside; we are not a very welcoming organization. Somehow a&#13;
lot of these people fail. We could do a better job at integrating and embracing people who come&#13;
with a different experience. And again, in my mind, that goes to the heart of the organizational&#13;
culture of this place and the inability we have to appreciate that anyone else has anything&#13;
valuable to contribute.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Acknowledgment of the expertise of others. Itâ&#128;&#152;s been difficult for this place as an&#13;
institution to do so.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: And it has to do very much with the ability to have more diversity. At the&#13;
same time, it worries me very much to see that because you put quotas or things like that, targets,&#13;
you make the wrong choices and the wrong decisions for two reasons. One, it devalues women&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
in general, or women in management in general, which is not a good thing. And second, if they&#13;
are from Part Two countries, which tend to be the case, it is even worse. So to me this is a long&#13;
run proposition. Itâ&#128;&#152;s something thatâ&#128;&#152;s beyond gender. Itâ&#128;&#152;s the quality of leaders and the quality&#13;
of people you bring into the organization.&#13;
&#13;
There have been a number of attempts to create some group of senior women and so on, but it&#13;
doesnâ&#128;&#152;t really take. People are so busy; theyâ&#128;&#152;re coping and dealing with their own workload, so&#13;
they donâ&#128;&#152;t have the time, and since nobody cares anyway whether you do it or not, it just does&#13;
not get done. Itâ&#128;&#152;s again part of the incentives of the system that is not very conducive to this.&#13;
When I had a role to play, I hired women, lots of women, and men, too, if they are good, you&#13;
know. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s part of this work that I mentioned earlier on recruitment.&#13;
&#13;
My vision for the Bank is that the Bank continues to do decentralized recruitment where&#13;
managers choose what they need. But instead of the recruitment HR provides, I would outsource&#13;
the whole thing where headhunters and companies that recruit locally bring in candidates that are&#13;
tested and checked out and interviewed by professional interviewers. That way, if you need an&#13;
educator, and looking at the profile of my region and my group I see I really should get a&#13;
Southern African person for that group, then the recruiters brings me ten candidates, top quality,&#13;
all from Southern Africa, and you can marry the two objectives. Iâ&#128;&#152;d be only too thrilled to make&#13;
the Bank happy and solve my problem with quality. Itâ&#128;&#152;s a win-win.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: So, would you say the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s overall recruitment policies are not that supportive of its&#13;
strategies and objectives?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Well, they are again fragmented just like everything else we discussed.&#13;
Everybody does their own little decisions the best they can. But, when you add it all up, it&#13;
doesnâ&#128;&#152;t necessarily add up. You have very cumbersome processes. The same things weâ&#128;&#152;ve&#13;
spoken about in some of the other areas.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Looking back, based on your extensive experience working on human development&#13;
issues, both as Sector Director and as Director in HR, how would you compare the challenges in&#13;
tackling human development issues internally within the Bank to tackling them externally in&#13;
developing countries?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: You know, actually I donâ&#128;&#152;t think itâ&#128;&#152;s about human development or HR or&#13;
sectors. I think itâ&#128;&#152;s about the business models and the mental models you operate with inside and&#13;
outside the Bank. If you are working in an environment where your clients have to want you,&#13;
have to value what you have to add, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s why you are there, the way you need to work is&#13;
extremely collaborative, very demanding technically, fast and timely and no hassle bureaucratic&#13;
crap. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s how you do that. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s how you need to work with the country. If you look at the&#13;
inside of the organization, we need the same thing. Itâ&#128;&#152;s exactly the same thing.&#13;
&#13;
What I do see is that itâ&#128;&#152;s very hard to sell what you donâ&#128;&#152;t have. The accomplishments that many&#13;
people and many groups in the Bank managed to do with their clients and so on, they do them in&#13;
spite of the Bank, not because of the system and so on.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Moving on to World Bank presidents, what is your assessment of the various&#13;
presidents under whose leadership you served? And, in your opinion, what should be the criteria&#13;
for selecting World Bank presidents in terms of both their personal and professional leadership&#13;
attributes? And youâ&#128;&#152;ve spoken a little about senior leadership.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: I think Iâ&#128;&#152;ve spoken a little about senior leadership. You know, on the early&#13;
ones, of course I have absolutely nothing to say because this was too distant for me to mean&#13;
anything.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Okay, where do we begin?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: We can begin with Wolfensohn.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Okay. He came in June of 1995.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: And I think he truly gave another lease of life to this organization for a few&#13;
years and repositioned the Bank very well externally. Plus he gave staff a really lofty mission&#13;
we all embraced: poverty reduction. I think internally, though, the changes that were put in&#13;
place were not really implemented the way they were meant to be implemented, so a number of&#13;
the issues we discussed were actually not solved. You know, we changed the boxes, we changed&#13;
the names of things, a number of sentences and words become buzz words like team work,&#13;
collaboration, client orientation, et cetera. I would like to see somebody who really focuses on&#13;
transforming the Organization now.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Its organizational culture, basically.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Itâ&#128;&#152;s the organization, the organizational culture and really be willing to lead. I&#13;
think at this point the place lost its way for two and a half years. The second generation issues&#13;
generated by the matrix and this organizational structure and, you know, the changes in&#13;
technology, the change in the world and so on, still have to be absorbed and processed internally&#13;
to become a 21st century organization. And I would think that someone who really wants to lift&#13;
this organization to excel is absolutely central, and I havenâ&#128;&#152;t really seen that.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Well, related to the continued relevance of the Institution, President [Robert B.]&#13;
Zoellick who has just taken on that job this year, in July 2007, recently spoke of a World Bank&#13;
becoming â&#128;&#149;smarter, faster and cheaper.â&#128;&#150; He would like the Institution to move towards the&#13;
achievement of more sustainable and inclusive growth. What do you think he has displayed so&#13;
far in his short tenure as President of the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Well, Iâ&#128;&#152;m extremely glad that President Zoellick put in the agenda promoting&#13;
the Bank as a knowledge and learning institution. Actually, this is the reason Iâ&#128;&#152;m going to&#13;
continue consulting for the Bank after I leave because this was a topic that was pretty much&#13;
abandoned and was out of the radar screen of senior management for the last two and a half&#13;
years. And two and a half years of neglect of this particular topic in the 21st century cannot be&#13;
afforded by any institution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                               December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Whatâ&#128;&#152;s going to come out of it? Thatâ&#128;&#152;s another story. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s a completely different story,&#13;
something that in a way is linked to what I said earlier about presidents really following through&#13;
in the implementation of their decisions and so on.&#13;
&#13;
You know, somehow we have this incredible ability to take on things and instead of truly&#13;
embracing them we kind of adapt them to our way of operating so they become just another&#13;
checklist. Like the OPE system, the 360. I couldnâ&#128;&#152;t believe it. I go out and started looking&#13;
outside how to evaluate people and find the same things we have. So whatâ&#128;&#152;s wrong with it? Itâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
us, itâ&#128;&#152;s not the tool. You have it in my paper as a main big issue, and you realize it is not about&#13;
knowledge and learning per se. Itâ&#128;&#152;s not about doing more training courses; it is not about doing&#13;
more websites. Itâ&#128;&#152;s about incentives, itâ&#128;&#152;s about management; itâ&#128;&#152;s about really putting your&#13;
decision making, your money and your efforts and so on where your mouth is.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: What is your assessment of the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s various evaluative mechanisms (e.g., IEG&#13;
previously OED [Operations Evaluation Department], QAG, the Inspection Panel, et cetera), in&#13;
terms of contribution to quality and effectiveness of the development agenda?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Well, I would put the Inspection Panel in another category. Iâ&#128;&#152;m going to talk&#13;
about IEG, QAG, and so on. There are additional evaluative mechanisms that are a part of the&#13;
work thatâ&#128;&#152;s done by DEC, by the regions, and by others which are very important, actually. It&#13;
should be a lot more systematically done The only way we can survive in this world is showing&#13;
the impact of what we actually get done. And the work of IEG, QAG is even more central.&#13;
However, what you see is IEG and QAG as accountability mechanisms. You use their work to&#13;
make sure they donâ&#128;&#152;t rate you poorly because that will damage your indicators as a department.&#13;
But youâ&#128;&#152;re not really seeking their feedback and so on to improve your product.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank should be a lot more systematic about evaluation of the impact of the interventions we&#13;
finance. For example, the Conditional Cash Transfers and the reform of the welfare system in&#13;
the safety net in Brazil had an impact evaluation. Thanks to this work, Brazil and the Bank have&#13;
been able to show the impact of the CCT program. That is--in my mind--what the Bank should&#13;
be doing a lot more of. If not, how are we going to learn?&#13;
&#13;
Let me give you an example. In the mid-â&#128;&#151;90s, Latin America had implemented a number of&#13;
social investment fund projects. These were projects that were put together with the adjustment&#13;
programs we talked about earlier. The original intent was to create employment but later on that&#13;
shifted to ensure the provision of basic services and small infrastructure. We evaluated four Latin&#13;
American countries and two countries outside Latin America. We found out that these funds&#13;
were not having an impact on unemployment, and that they had a different kind of impact. After&#13;
we saw that, Latin America did not do anymore those kinds of projects. Theyâ&#128;&#152;re still being done&#13;
in Africa and elsewhere. Is that a good or bad idea? I do not know. Weâ&#128;&#152;re being extraordinarily&#13;
penny wise and pound foolish, I think, when it comes to evaluations as key learning tools.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: What are your views on the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s role as convener and mobilizer of resources?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: You know, this is really a very interesting question, and I have seen it now,&#13;
particularly, from the HR side. There are trust funds for hiring people and so on, and I think this&#13;
&#13;
                                    Ana-Maria Arriagada&#13;
                                December 11, 2007 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
is a pretty strategic question that should be looked at very carefully. There is no question in&#13;
terms of whatâ&#128;&#152;s going on outside the Bank that given the fact weâ&#128;&#152;re not the only players weâ&#128;&#152;ve&#13;
got to learn to play in the sandbox with other people, thatâ&#128;&#152;s number one. So now learning to&#13;
convince anyone or anybody, you first have to play with them; otherwise, itâ&#128;&#152;s very hard to be a&#13;
convener and to have credibility out there or whatever role it is youâ&#128;&#152;re going to play. I donâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
think that the Bank has an option not to be or not to strengthen its capacity to be a convener, an&#13;
honest broker. Weâ&#128;&#152;re not brokering bilateral deals anymore, anywhere. So, the choice we have&#13;
is how well we play. And I think we could do a lot better.&#13;
&#13;
Managing resources for others is becoming a more and more important question. Weâ&#128;&#152;re&#13;
mobilizing and managing. This could be a good line of business for the Bank, particularly in&#13;
global products. I think thatâ&#128;&#152;s all fine and actually could be a very good business for the Bank,&#13;
provided that there is a very clear and coherent framework to manage and to use these moneys.&#13;
The danger here is to have the financiers dictating the agenda of the Bank. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s a very&#13;
different story.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: What about the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s coordination and collaboration efforts, particularly with the&#13;
IMF, the UN, regional banks and other international and bilateral agencies?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: I think everything we have spoken about relationships and our difficulty&#13;
working with others applies to them.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: I mean, are we now more accepting of the leadership of others or are we better at&#13;
recognizing the leadership of others?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: I donâ&#128;&#152;t really know. I have been out of Operations for two and a half years so I&#13;
donâ&#128;&#152;t really know exactly what is going on. The only thing that I can say is that weâ&#128;&#152;re not very&#13;
good at not being the leaders. Iâ&#128;&#152;ve had a number of colleagues from other organizations talking&#13;
about our efforts around harmonization, for example, and saying that harmonization for us is â&#128;&#149;the&#13;
World Bank way.â&#128;&#150; That certainly is not good.&#13;
&#13;
I am very clear that we are--from my current assignment--putting a lot of effort into building that&#13;
capacity. But again, we go back to the issue of incentives. On one hand we are providing&#13;
people with training and learning principles on how you create partnerships and foster them and&#13;
so on, but on the other hand, staff are pushed into, quicker, faster, whatever, and particular, you&#13;
know, incentives and demands from their managers. Iâ&#128;&#152;m sorry; the learning is going to be&#13;
useless.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: What, if anything, in the criticism directed at the Bank by NGOâ&#128;&#152;s and others do you&#13;
consider legitimate and worthy of serious attention?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Well, look, I mean, I think Iâ&#128;&#152;ve pointed them out myself. Right?&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Yes, yes, you have. The same thing goes for NGOs [non-governmental&#13;
organizations]?&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: I think we have been very shy as an organization to actually say to NGOs, â&#128;&#149;We&#13;
donâ&#128;&#152;t agree.â&#128;&#150; At the other end, we are so afraid of saying, â&#128;&#149;I was wrong, I made a mistake, and&#13;
we didnâ&#128;&#152;t do the right thing here.,â&#128;&#150; that thatâ&#128;&#152;s kind of something that the Bank seems to think is&#13;
absolutely impossible to do, and so we go the other way. We go to the other extreme to make&#13;
sure we donâ&#128;&#152;t make mistakes. We put all these protective measures and stifle innovation,&#13;
creativity, in our staff. At the same time, we have a public information policy that is much more&#13;
open than we ever had before. So there are some signs of progress.&#13;
&#13;
My biggest fear, actually, is that our progress may be fast for the World Bank, but itâ&#128;&#152;s too slow&#13;
for the world in terms of how fast the rest of the world is moving. Somebody was saying the&#13;
other day, â&#128;&#149;We are like the Queen Maryâ&#128;&#150;--you know, the ship--â&#128;&#149;The rest of the world moves in&#13;
speed boats, and weâ&#128;&#152;re still in the Queen Mary.â&#128;&#150; Do we really want to be the Queen Mary? Can&#13;
we afford to be the Queen Mary? I donâ&#128;&#152;t think so.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Of your many contributions to the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s mission, which do you consider to be most&#13;
significant and why?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: I didnâ&#128;&#152;t know actually which ones or which contributions in particular. To me,&#13;
the closest to my heart, and thereâ&#128;&#152;s no question about it, is the work the Bank did in the&#13;
reconstruction of El Salvador after the war and the work in the education sector there. It was&#13;
such a privilege to see how our first project coordinator later became the Minister of Education.&#13;
Besides wonderful experiences in many other countries, the other big thing has been the staff that&#13;
I have worked with and some of the people that should be the leaders of the future. They are&#13;
outstanding people who combine very sharp minds and very strong technical skills with very&#13;
developed leadership qualities and interpersonal skills. Yes, thatâ&#128;&#152;s the kind of leadership the 21st&#13;
century calls for.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Looking back, what have you learned from your journey/experience at the Bank? And,&#13;
what has it meant to you personally serving as unique an institution as the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Well, Iâ&#128;&#152;ve learned an enormous amount, and Iâ&#128;&#152;ve had a fabulous career, a&#13;
fascinating career. Iâ&#128;&#152;ve been happy, very, very happy working here. I mean, I wanted to come&#13;
to work every day for about twenty years. I have had exciting work, fabulous colleagues,&#13;
challenging things, and I had the chance to be all over the world. Iâ&#128;&#152;m extraordinarily grateful&#13;
for the opportunities I had in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, Iâ&#128;&#152;ve given a lot to the Bank in the sense that Iâ&#128;&#152;ve done my best. And one of&#13;
the things that I see as hard has been that my views about management and about how you need&#13;
to work have been a minority view. The reason for leaving early is exactly that. I do not want to&#13;
spend so much energy managing the internal organization as opposed to getting the mission and&#13;
the job done with the clients.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Most difficult at times?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: Well, itâ&#128;&#152;s very difficult to feel, for the most part, like a salmon swimming&#13;
against the current all the time.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Finally, is there anything else you wish to talk about that I might have perhaps&#13;
overlooked?&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: No, I think I have talked about more than I would have wanted to talk about.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Okay. Many thanks for a most productive interview and for your invaluable&#13;
contribution to the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s Oral History Program.&#13;
&#13;
ARRIAGADA: My pleasure. I just wish and I really hope that all the contributions that you are&#13;
getting from all the different people that you are interviewing are really used by this organization&#13;
to learn and move on. And I would really encourage you to look for avenues and keep up to&#13;
make sure that the work and reflections that you are capturing here are actually processed and&#13;
used by the decision makers in this place to learn basically from people who have spent most of&#13;
their careers here.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Well, thank you very much.&#13;
