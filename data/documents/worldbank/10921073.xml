Ebel, Robert&#13;
(Notation: The World Bank Institute was formerly called the Economic Development Institute&#13;
(EDI), as reflected in some text)&#13;
&#13;
The Economic Development Institute (EDI) conducted a core course on intergovernmental&#13;
relations and local financial management on March 16-27, 1998, in Vienna, Austria. The&#13;
course was created to facilitate well-functioning intergovernmental systems in the context of&#13;
transition economy reforms. The objectives of this course were threefold: (i) provide an&#13;
operational framework to raise the level of fiscal policy debate, (ii) build long term capacity&#13;
through the training of trainers, and (iii) develop a network for cross-country sharing of&#13;
experiences with best (and failed) practices. The target audience was comprised of senior&#13;
and mid-level officials in local governments, central ministries that have intergovernmental&#13;
responsibilities, analysts with research institutes, key academics and selected key&#13;
journalists.&#13;
&#13;
This course was evaluated by the EDI Evaluation Unit. The evaluation was in the form of a&#13;
post-course questionnaire asking for participants' opinions on several aspects of the course.&#13;
It consisted of 45 questions, of which 42 covered 7 categories, 2 assessed overall&#13;
satisfaction with the course and 1 question assessed whether input was adequately&#13;
considered during course preparation. The 7 categories were: course relevance, benefits&#13;
provided, group make-up, methods, time and sequencing, logistics, and trainers. Twenty-four&#13;
out of 30 participants (80%) responded to the questionnaire. All questions on the evaluation&#13;
used a 5-point Likert type scale that ranged from 1=minimum to 5=maximum. Results from&#13;
the evaluation are summarized below. The evaluation also used a set of "rapid response"&#13;
questionnaires that asked questions directly aimed at specific presenters and their&#13;
presentations. The same 5-point scale was used to record these opinions. The following is a&#13;
summary of the evaluation results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  The two overall questions received favorable responses. The first question asked if the&#13;
        course was a worthwhile use of time (mean=4.30). The second question asked if&#13;
        participants would recommend the course to their colleagues. Twenty-three of the 24&#13;
        respondents said "yes."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Comparing the range of mean scores for each of the 6 categories highlights one area&#13;
        that may be focused on in the planning of future courses. The methods category&#13;
        asked for participants' opinions on the presentation, case studies, examples, and&#13;
        practice exercises that were used throughout the course. The range of mean scores&#13;
        for this category was 3.00 to 4.13. The lowest mean score was given for the practice&#13;
        exercises method of instruction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  The item that received the highest single mean score (4.73) asked participants if&#13;
        administrative assistance was adequate. The items addressing the relevance of the&#13;
        course to future work or functions (mean=4.50) and the extent to which resource&#13;
        persons knew the issues well (mean=4.46) also scored in the upper range of all the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 questions asked.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lA noticeable trend in the evaluation was the heterogeneity of opinions on the course.&#13;
 High standard deviations were seen, with a range of standard deviations from .55 for&#13;
 the question addressing the adequacy of administrative assistance to 1.44 for the&#13;
 question addressing properly arranged accommodations. Moreover, a high number of&#13;
 items (19 of 45) received a minimum score of 1 and a maximum score of 5, indicating&#13;
 that respondents' opinions varied significantly. Items receiving a minimum score of 1&#13;
 and a maximum score of 5 were not concentrated in any specific category of the&#13;
 evaluation. Written comments confirmed the variation in opinions, especially in&#13;
 reference to course content. It is suggested that demographic information (i.e.&#13;
 occupation, gender, education) be collected in future evaluations so that the&#13;
 significance of this heterogeneity of opinions can be investigated further.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lOne evaluation question asked whether participant input was adequately considered&#13;
 during the preparation of the course. This item received a mean score of 2.58, which&#13;
 was the lowest item score.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lSeveral items in the questionnaire clearly addressed the first objective. Questions&#13;
 asked how effectively the course taught policy requirements (mean score=4.00),&#13;
 policy alternatives (mean score=3.71), and policy consequences (mean score=3.83).&#13;
 However, the evaluation questions did not accurately assess the second and third&#13;
 objectives. Future evaluations may include questions that determine whether, after&#13;
 having taken this course, respondents feel better suited to be trainers in their&#13;
 respective countries (objective 2). Also, questions may gauge how much this course&#13;
 provided a forum for sharing of experiences between respondents (objective 3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lResults from the rapid response questionnaires showed an overall high level of&#13;
 satisfaction with the presenters' methods and the content of their material. Two&#13;
 presenters, however, stood out as having some difficulty with their presentation style.&#13;
 Participants rated them in the mid to lower range of the 5-point scale in their use of&#13;
 valid case examples and in participants' opportunity to ask questions. The ability to&#13;
 pin-point specific performances will give planners the opportunity to work to improve&#13;
 performance in future course offerings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lOne limitation of this questionnaire was that it was based only on participants'&#13;
 opinions. A pre/post course self-assessment test or cognitive test would be a useful&#13;
 tool to increase the scope of this evaluation. A self-assessment test is useful to learn&#13;
 how much a participant's confidence level on a particular topic has increased. A&#13;
 cognitive test is necessary to determine how much knowledge a participant has&#13;
 actually gained. Either tool would complement the questionnaire in its current form. A&#13;
 second limitation of this evaluation is the chance of 'non-respondent' error. As&#13;
 mentioned, 24 out of 30 participants (80%) responded to the questionnaire. If those&#13;
 that did not respond were, as a group, more (or less) satisfied with the course than&#13;
 the participants that did respond, the results of this evaluation will be skewed. It is&#13;
 therefore important to encourage all participants to respond.&#13;
