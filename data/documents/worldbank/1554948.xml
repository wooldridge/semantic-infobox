ON PROTECTIONISM IN THE NETHERLANDS&#13;
This work in progress report is part of an inquiry being undertaken&#13;
by the World Bank in conjunction with scholars from twelve industrial coun-&#13;
tries into the penetration of the markets of industrial countries by exports&#13;
of manufactures from developing countries. The project seeks to establish&#13;
the shares of industrial country markets held by the developing countries,&#13;
changes in such shares in the 1970s, and why they vary among industry groups&#13;
and countries. The aim is to assist developing and industrial countries to&#13;
improve their policies through a better understanding of trade patterns and&#13;
protectionist pressures.&#13;
The paper is introduced by a bird's eye view of developments in indus-&#13;
try and trade since World War II. Changes in the structure of industrial&#13;
production as well as shifts in industrial policies due to changing objectives&#13;
of socio-economic policy are discussed. Trade policies, in particular their&#13;
protectionist aspects, are considered.&#13;
Estimates of the level of total effective assistance have been calcu-&#13;
lated. Total assistance consists of four types of protectionist measures:&#13;
tariffs, subsidies, taxes and variable levies. These estimates were made&#13;
for 17 industrial sectors of Dutch manufacturing industry for the years 1970,&#13;
1975 and 1976. This corresponds to the level of aggregation of the Nether-&#13;
lands input-output tables, as they are published by the Central Bureau of&#13;
Statistics. For the year 1975 similar estimates are also presented for 32&#13;
industrial sectors, use being made of an unpublished input-output table.&#13;
Special attention is given to the role of subsidies in Dutch economic policy.&#13;
The differences in assistance among sectors are analyzed for each of&#13;
the available years. This is done with the aid of the three models of poli-&#13;
tical economy developed by Richard Caves: the adding machine, interest group and&#13;
national policy models.The paper concludes with a brief summary of the&#13;
results obtained.&#13;
The authors want to thank Mr. J. Swank for his computational assist-&#13;
ance and Miss M. Koffijberg for her skillful typing. Thanks are due to the&#13;
Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics for the assistance and cooperation&#13;
provided in collecting the necessary data.&#13;

1. Introduction&#13;
1.1 Industrial development after World War II.&#13;
The recovery after World War II was mainly based on export-led&#13;
growth. To achieve this, the Netherlands remained, more or less by&#13;
con/ensus, a low-wage country till about the middle of the sixties.&#13;
The change in the structure of the Dutch economy is presented in figure&#13;
1 and table 1. 1/&#13;

It can be clearly seen that the manufacturing sector increased its&#13;
share in the gross domestic product from some eighteen percent in 1950 to&#13;
more than twenty seven percent in 1970, to decrease thereafter. Table 2&#13;
shows the increasing importance, throughout the period 1950-1975, of&#13;
merchandise exports.&#13;

The structural characteristics of this development can be summarized in&#13;
the followlng way 2/:&#13;
- emphasis on large scale industries&#13;
- a specialized pattern of production&#13;
- emphasis on bulk-products rather than differentiated products&#13;
- intermediate rather than capital goods production&#13;
- processing rather than engineering capabilities&#13;
In sum there was a "newly industrializing country" (NIC) type of&#13;
industrial development. 3/ This development has placed the Dutch economy&#13;
in a difficult position in more recent years as the Netherlands is no&#13;
longer a low-wage country. Another factor that led to the erosion of&#13;
Dutch industry's competitiveness has been the appreciation of the Dutch&#13;
guilder. This appreciation is mostly due to the fact that the Netherlands,&#13;
with its large exports of natural gas, has earned high resource rents,&#13;
particularly since the 1970s increases in the price of petroleum 4/.&#13;
The government's concern with these developments is reflected in&#13;
successive memoranda on the state of industry in the Netherlands. 5/ At&#13;
the beginning of the fifties, issues concerned with recovery and the&#13;
creation of full employment, against a background of diminishing employment&#13;
in agriculture and a fast growing population, predominated. Later, as full&#13;
employment was achieved, other, more qualitative, aspects of industrialization&#13;
came to the fore. These included concerns with regional dispersion and&#13;
working conditions. Growing concern with the Netherlands competitive&#13;
situation culminated in the Memorandum on selective growth in 1976. 6/&#13;
Selective growth--meaning that account should be taken of policy constraints&#13;
on economic growth--was emphasized. The constraints noted reflected&#13;
objectives related to-environmental conditions, spatial distribution of&#13;
industry, the international division of labor, and the scarcity of non-&#13;
renewable resources, in particular energy.&#13;
The main emphasis in industrial growth thus shifted toward&#13;
problems of restructuring the Dutch economy, that is, adjusting Dutch&#13;
industry to increasing international competitiveness, in a stagnating&#13;
world economy.&#13;
Restructuring the Dutch economy was moreover, to take place in&#13;
the context of the relocation of suitable industries to developing countries&#13;
to facilitate the international division of labor. A special&#13;

fund created for this objective. Restructuring the Dutch economy in general&#13;
was accompanied by substantial public financial support, of all types, for&#13;
Dutch industry. Total support to Dutch industry in the period 1975-1978&#13;
amounted to more than 7 billion guilders (about US$2.9 billion)(see below,&#13;
section 2.3, for further detail). But in general support to Dutch industry&#13;
was rather ad hoc and defensive in the seventies, and this was recognized&#13;
in a new memorandum on industrialisation 7/.   In this memorandum the govern-&#13;
ment declared its intention of henceforth supporting industry more on a&#13;
sectoral basis and of being more "offensive", that is stimulating those&#13;
activities that are more in line with the (future) comparative advantage of&#13;
a highly developed country.&#13;
1.2.   Trade policy&#13;
Because industrial policies are often suspected of having a protec-&#13;
tionist impact, it is of some interest to give an overview of the Dutch&#13;
attitude toward liberal trade conditions. The trade policy within the EEC&#13;
is , of course, no longer a national matter, but is decided upon at the&#13;
Community level 8/. But community decisions are influenced by national&#13;
views of the member states. Moreover, protection can be pursued by other&#13;
means than trade policy.&#13;
Two recent memoranda to Parliament, one on protection in general,&#13;
the other on the results of the Tokyo-round 9/, give the Dutch government's&#13;
views on protection.  The memorandum on protection starts with a recommen-&#13;
dation for free trade, modified by infant-industry and strategic minimum&#13;
output arguments for protection. It sketches the international economic&#13;
climate with its strong appeal for protection, but stresses the importance&#13;
of keeping up the developing countries' possibilities of exporting, to&#13;
increase their effective demand. While protection is thus emphatically&#13;
rejected, it is several times stressed that adjustment to structural&#13;
changes in the international division of labour, should be gradual.&#13;
The Dutch government also wholeheartedly supports selective safe-&#13;
guards, as advocated by the Community throughout the Tokyo-round nego-&#13;
tiations. The memorandum on the results of the Tokyo-round indicates&#13;
the Dutch position vis-a-vis the other Community-members in determining&#13;
the European Commission's negotiating mandate for the Tokyo-round 10/.&#13;
It is clearly stated that the Dutch government's starting point has&#13;
always been that Dutch interests lie more on the export side than on the&#13;
import side. The government goes on to claim that it has hardly, if ever,&#13;
been the Netherlands, that within the Community, has "dragged its feet"&#13;
over further trade liberalisation 11/.&#13;
7/ Ministerie van Economische Zaken /247/.&#13;
8/ For the scope of action by member countries in the field of trade,&#13;
see for example A. Borrman, / 3_I._    _&#13;
9/ Ministerie van Economische Zaken / 21i   , / 22_7.&#13;
10/ Ministerie van Economische Zaken / 22_/, p. 22/23.&#13;
I1/ In view of the argument that the openness of the Dutch economy naturally&#13;
leads to favouring free trade, it may be interesting to know that the&#13;
Dutch Government, in the middle of the seventies, did have second thoughts&#13;
about the power of this argument, as the Netherlands' trade is mainly (80%)&#13;
with the EEC and associated countries; see Ministerie van Economische&#13;
Zaken / 21_I, p. 12.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
Several other policies indicate the Dutch government's stand on pro-&#13;
tection, although it is difficult to evaluate them quantitatively. Firstly,&#13;
one may look at the way restructuring policy is implemented. This will be&#13;
dealt with below in section 2. Secondly, one might try to establish the&#13;
extent to which non-tariff-barriers are being used. This is a rather&#13;
obscure field, but it seems that the Netherlands do not belong to the major&#13;
culprits in this respect 12/.&#13;
Thirdly, there is the field of government procurement.   Here it seems&#13;
that some change has taken place over the years 13/.   Although in the past&#13;
the government stressed the notion of "value for money" as the leading&#13;
principle for government procurement, currently the importance of government&#13;
procurement for stimulating innovative activities has gained more acceptance.&#13;
Recently, moreover, the government ordered a number of Volvo cars for the&#13;
police force at the very moment that the Dutch Volvo subsidiary was, once&#13;
again, in difficulties. Stimulating innovation apparently may give way to&#13;
maintaining employment.&#13;
Fourthly, protectionist possibilities still exist in trade policy,&#13;
because of the, as yet, not complete harmonisation of policy within the EEC.&#13;
Governments may invoke Article 115 of the Treaty of Rome, the so-called&#13;
"caoutchouc article", or, more formally, the safeguard clause. This article&#13;
may be invoked when a country suspects that bilateral arrangements with non-&#13;
EEC members are being bypassed by imports through another member of the&#13;
Community. It is necessary to have the Commission's approval for application&#13;
of Article 115. This is given upon fulfillment of certain conditions 14/.&#13;
Article 115 implies the monitoring of third country imports that enter a&#13;
member country via another member country, that is, intra-EEC free flow of&#13;
trade no longer exists for such imports. If such monitoring leads to proof&#13;
of trade diversion licences to import may be refused. According to some&#13;
sources more and more use is made of this loophole 15/.&#13;
For the Benelux countries application of Article 115 concerns firstly&#13;
a number of textile products, coming in general, from Eastern Europe or Asia,&#13;
and secondly a varied collection of other simple products, originating in&#13;
Eastern Europe, China or Japan 16/.&#13;
12/ A recent clear example, though, of the use of non-tariff barriers is given by the&#13;
fact that the Dutch government has tightened the administrative require-&#13;
ments for the importation of Japanese cars; see Financial Times / 12_/&#13;
p. 4.&#13;
13/ Ministerie van Economische Zaken /24_/, p. 49.&#13;
14/ See, for these conditions, "Decree of the Commission, no. 80/47/EEG" /11_7.&#13;
15/ In-  en Uitvoernieuws /14_7, p. 868/869 and /15_7, p. 772.&#13;
16/ In- en Uitvoernieuws, / 14_I, p. 876,878; this was the situation halfway through&#13;
1980. Application of article 115 for these products was allowed until the&#13;
end of 1981. The number may have increased in the meantime. Judging from&#13;
the application of article 115, at that moment,       G &amp;ermany, followed by&#13;
Denmark, is least protectionist by far, while the Benelux, France and&#13;
Italy are most protectionist.&#13;

2.     The structure of protection&#13;
2.1.   Methodology&#13;
In this paper the effective rates of assistance include the effects of&#13;
four separate categories of distortive economic policy measures, viz.:&#13;
1. tariffs&#13;
2. variable levies&#13;
3. domestic taxes cum subsidies&#13;
4. export subsidies.&#13;
1. the use of tariffs in this context needs no comment.&#13;
2. the variable levy is one of the main instruments of the common agri-&#13;
cultural policy (CAP) of the EEC. Variable levies are used to equate&#13;
world market prices of importer farm products with the, higher, gua-&#13;
ranteed European farm prices 17/. This shields the farm sector from&#13;
world market price influences 18/. At the same time these levies&#13;
imply negative protection for the food industries, which acquire an&#13;
important part of their intermediate deliveries from the farm sector.&#13;
3. domestic taxes and subsidies also modify the competitive position of&#13;
domestic producers compared with imported products. The particular&#13;
role of these taxes and subsidies in this respect depends on the&#13;
assumption to be made with regard to their impact on domestic prices.&#13;
4. export subsidies are another important instrument of the CAP. Export&#13;
subsidies enable domestic producers, in particular in the farm sector&#13;
and in the food processing industries, to compete on the world market&#13;
by compensating for variable levies paid on the imported inputs of&#13;
these sectors and by outright subsidies.&#13;
Our point of departure with regard to the price and thus value-added effects&#13;
of these measures has been the so-called small-country assumption, i.e. the&#13;
Netherlands cannot exert influence on the world market prices of its own&#13;
exports and imports. For this reason the price effects of the four policy&#13;
measures can be described in the following way:&#13;
1.     Tariffs exert an upward influence on prices in line with the percent-&#13;
age applied.&#13;
2.     Variable levies also influence prices upwards.   These levies will be&#13;
treated analogously to tariffs.&#13;
3.     Domestic taxes and subsidies consist of excise taxes (mainly on to-&#13;
bacco, mineral oil products and petroJl) and other taxes such as&#13;
environmental pollution taxes, administrative taxes etc. It must be&#13;
17/ In the CAP variable levies relate not only to imports of farm-gate&#13;
products but also to processed farm products. In the case of the&#13;
Netherlands, though, variable levies apply mainly to grains.&#13;
18/ See e.g. A.J. Yeats /31 /, ch. 5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
mentioned here that no account is taken of the price effects of the&#13;
value-added tax, because this tax is considered to be neutral with&#13;
regard to the calculation of effective rates of assistance 19/. On&#13;
subsidies more will be said below. Our assumption is that domestic&#13;
taxes and subsidies do not influence prices in general, except in&#13;
cases where these taxes (subsidies are not relevant here) are also&#13;
levied on imported products. This means that some excise taxes have&#13;
an upward influence on prices and thus have no effect on the factor&#13;
remuneration of the particular sector on whose products they are&#13;
levied. Insofar as other sectors receive intermediate deliveries&#13;
from these sectors, their input prices will be biased upwards. For&#13;
all other domestic taxes and subsidies no price effect is assumed.&#13;
This means that they directly decrease or increase the factor income&#13;
in the sectors, where they are relevant.&#13;
4.     Export subsidies are used to equate domestic producer prices with&#13;
world market prices. This will be reflected in the fact that&#13;
exports will be valued at world market prices.&#13;
Taking into account these four protectionist devices we proceed to&#13;
the calculation of the effective rates of assistance. With the effective&#13;
rate of assistance we mean the percentage change in sectoral value added&#13;
due to all four measures combined.&#13;
The following formula is used in calculating the effective rates of&#13;
assistance:&#13;
EP;         1&#13;
V&#13;
where    V. = gross value added at factor costs&#13;
V= gross value added measured at world market prices&#13;
V is unknown and has to be approximated from the actual situation.&#13;
Therefore, the value of sectoral output and inputs are expressed at world&#13;
market prices as presented in the following formula:&#13;

E:k    =  all indirecr taxes minus subsidies as a percentage of value&#13;
of output of non-tradables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
The following clarifications of the formula may be useful.&#13;
1.     We have followed the Leith method in assuming that only domestic sales&#13;
are protected by the tariff system 20/. Domestic sales only are&#13;
therefore deflated by the tariff. However, as the tariffs on imports&#13;
are EEC-wide common external tariffs, it is clear that Dutch producers&#13;
are not only protected on the Dutch market but also on other EEC-&#13;
markets 21/. So for purposes of effective protection calculation sales&#13;
to other EEC countries should be added to domestic sales; this implies&#13;
that only sales to third countries are considered exports.&#13;
2.     For the non-tradables it is assumed that all indirect taxes and&#13;
subsidies are reflected in their prices, due to lack of competition&#13;
from abroad. Non-tradables are treated according to Balassa's method&#13;
22/. The idea here is that non-tradables have zero effective protec-&#13;
tion. Thus the input coefficients of the tradable inputs into non-&#13;
tradables have to be corrected for the price effects of tariffs.&#13;
This can be done iteratively of course, but we are satisfied with&#13;
only one round of correction.&#13;
Decomposition of effective rates of assistance&#13;
To get some idea of the different effects of the various policy mea-&#13;
sures distinguished, we have decomposed the effective rates of assistance&#13;
into three parts:&#13;
a) the tariff and levy effect;&#13;
b) the domestic tax cum subsidy effect;&#13;
c) the export subsidy effect.&#13;
In formula:&#13;
IV        2V    3V&#13;
EP. =      -1+     j+j&#13;
Vj         j &#13;
where&#13;
V   =  V  + domestic taxes minus subsidies on output which do not influence&#13;
output prices + indirect taxes minus subsidies which have an impact&#13;
on input prices.&#13;
20/ See J. Clark Leith /10_7, pp. 596/597&#13;
21/ Because of the way in which the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics registers&#13;
the import duties collected, an ex-post identification of these duties for&#13;
various groups of foreign suppliers, i.e. developing countries, is a theo-&#13;
retically precarious and practically impossible task.&#13;
22/ See B. Balassa et.al. /1 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
2 V; = - / domestic taxes minus subsidies which do not influence output&#13;
prices + indirect taxes minus subsidies which have an impact on&#13;
input prices_7 - export subsidies&#13;
3V. = export subsidies&#13;
3&#13;
Thus:&#13;
v.&#13;
1 -1  measures the protective effect of tariffs and levies by excluding&#13;
v 1&#13;
tax and subsidy effects and will be. called "effective tariff pro-&#13;
tection"&#13;
2v.&#13;
1j     measures the protective effect of domestic taxes and subsidies&#13;
vj      via their assumed effects on value added and prices and will&#13;
be called "effective domestic tax cum subsidy assistance"&#13;
3V.     represents the protective effect of export subsidies and will&#13;
3&#13;
vl      be called "effective export subsidy    assistance".&#13;
Together these three components add up to total effective assistance.&#13;
Some additional comments&#13;
It should be kept in mind that for the Netherlands protection exists&#13;
at two levels. One is the EEC protection afforded by the common tariff&#13;
system and the CAP. The other is the national level which is represented&#13;
by the domestic subsidies + taxes effect. Taxes represent here excise&#13;
taxes, administrative taxes, taxes on environmental pollution etc.&#13;
Subsidies represent mainly, but not only, wage subsidies. There are&#13;
two problems in this connection. One is that probably not all wage subsidies&#13;
are recorded in the official statistics. This will lead to an underestimate&#13;
of the total effective assistance because part of these missing subsidies&#13;
may well be included in the row "other factor income". In that case V- will&#13;
be underestimated. The other problem is that all other types of subsidies,&#13;
like investment subsidies, low interest credits and the likes of that are not&#13;
classified as subsidies in the input-output table. More will be said on the&#13;
role of subsidies in section 2.3.&#13;
Finally, it should be stressed that other types of protection, such&#13;
as quotas for example, are not represented in these estimates. However,&#13;
we do think that these other types are not very important for the Netherlands,&#13;
in particular for the years under consideration and at the level of aggrega-&#13;
tion studied 23/.&#13;

2.2.   Results for 1970. 1975 and 1976&#13;
2.2.1. Results for 1970, 1975 and 1976: 17 industrial sectors&#13;
Effective rates of assistance are calculated for the years 1970, 1975&#13;
and 1976, for seventeen industrial sectors 24/. The results of the calcula-&#13;
tions are presented in tables 3, 4 and 5, respectively.   In each table nomi-&#13;
nal tariff protection, total effective assistance and its three components&#13;
are given.&#13;
The results for 1970&#13;
It is clear that, apart from the food industries, total assistance&#13;
is mainly based on tariff protection. Domestic tax and subsidy assistance&#13;
only adds or subtracts something at the margin. Both food sectors have&#13;
negative effective tariff protection 25/. Only in the case of "Food, based&#13;
on animal products" is the negative effective tariff protection more than&#13;
compensated for by the export subsidy effect. Four industries have total&#13;
assistance of more than twenty percent, viz. "Beverages and tobacco",&#13;
"Textiles", "Clothing" and "Leather and footwear". Three industries, "Food,&#13;
based on animal products", "Building materials" and "Metal products and&#13;
machinery" have total assistance between ten and twenty percent. Together&#13;
these seven industries account for 35% of gross value added at factor costs&#13;
in manufacturing industry and for 43% of industrial employment, in 1970.&#13;
The results for 1975&#13;
Again it can be said that total assistance was again mainly based on&#13;
tariff protection, except for the food industries. Nominal tariff protec-&#13;
tion generally decreased, apart from minor increases in "Food, based on&#13;
other products".and "Electrical machinery". The average nominal tariff&#13;
rate on competing industrial imports declined from 4.4 percent in 1970 to&#13;
2.8 percent in 1975. Because imports of petroleum products include oil&#13;
imports, this sector should be excluded from the comparison. The average&#13;
nominal tariff rate then declined from 5.6 percent to 4.4 percent.&#13;
The principal reason for the general decrease was the full implemen-&#13;
tation of the Kennedy round tariff cuts which took place in the period&#13;
1968-1972. Another reason, however is to be found in the way tariff rates&#13;
were calculated, that is, as duties collected divided by imports from third&#13;
countries. An unknown part of these imports was more or less duty free in&#13;
1975, either because of the generalised system of preferences of the EEC,&#13;
or because of the gradual abolition of tariffs on industrial imports from&#13;
EFTA countries 26/&#13;
24/ The calculations are based on input-output tables published by the&#13;
Dutch CBS. For a number of data, use was made of unpublished material,&#13;
supplied by the CBS. The precise origin of the data used is given in&#13;
ANNEX I and the list of references.&#13;
25/ This is mainly due to the high variable levy percentage on imported&#13;
farm products, mainly grains, ad 18.1%.&#13;
26/ The fact that in 1975 not all intra-EEC trade was duty free, namely trade&#13;
between old and new members of the EEC, is completely disregarded in the&#13;
calculations. As said before, it is only protection against third&#13;
countries that is calculated.&#13;

For most industries effective assistance also decreased, except for&#13;
the food industries and for "Clothing". The percentage of variable levies&#13;
on farm imports decreased faster than the tariff percentage on similar&#13;
imports 27/. For "Clothing" the explanation is that tariffs on inputs (in&#13;
particular textiles and chemicals) decreased faster than the average tariffs&#13;
on "Clothing". The greatest decrease in effective assistance, to be found&#13;
in "Beverages and tobacco", can be traced to the decrease in nominal tariff&#13;
protection.&#13;
In 1975 there were three industries with effective assistance rates&#13;
of more than twenty percent, viz. "Food, based on animal products", "Tex-&#13;
tiles' and "Clothing" and one industry with effective assistance between&#13;
ten and twenty percent, namely "Beverages and tobacco". Together these&#13;
four industries accounted for eleven percent of industrial gross value&#13;
added at factor costs, and for seventeen percent of industrial employment.&#13;
It seems that protection had become relatively more employment directed.&#13;
The results for 1976&#13;
Only a few changes occurred between 1975 and 1976 28/. The main&#13;
difference can be found in both the food processing industries, for which&#13;
total effective assistance decreased. This was mainly due to an increase&#13;
in the percentage of variable levies on imported farm products 29/.&#13;
The situation for both food industries was more or less comparable&#13;
with 1970. Furthermore there was a small increase in nominal tariff pro-&#13;
tection, and therefore total effective assistance, for "Beverages and&#13;
Tobacco". For "Textiles" the decrease in total effective assistance was&#13;
caused by a decrease in nominal tariff protection while the opposite applied&#13;
for "Leather and footwear". Other sectors with decreasing nominal tariff&#13;
protection and thus decreasing total effective assistance were "Building&#13;
materials" and "Electrical machinery" 30/.&#13;
Finally, four industries had an effective rate of assistance of&#13;
more than ten percent, viz. "Beverage. and tobacco", "Textiles", "Clothing"&#13;
and "Leather and footwear". Together these four industries accounted for&#13;
almost seven percent of industrial gross value added at factor costs and&#13;
for eleven percent of industrial employment.&#13;
2.2.2. Results for 1975: 32 industrial sectors&#13;
While the calculations presented in section 2.2.1. are based on an&#13;
27/ The variable levy on imported farm products amounts to 8.3% in 1975.&#13;
28/ It should be kept in mind that apart from the EEC preferential scheme&#13;
and the tariff arrangements between the EEC and EFTA countries no&#13;
nominal tariff changes have taken place between 1975 and 1976. Other&#13;
reasons for a change in the ex-post calculated tariff rates may be&#13;
price variations, product mix changes and rounding errors in the&#13;
original calculations of the duties collected.&#13;
29/ The percentage of variable levies on imported farm products amounts to&#13;
18.2% in 1976.&#13;
30/ We will restrict our comments to those sectors which are further&#13;
disaggregated than before.&#13;

input-output table representing thirty four industries, we now present&#13;
results, based on an input-output table with fifty four sectors of which&#13;
thirty two are in manufacturing. The results are given in table 6. Of&#13;
the thirty two industries ten belong to the group of food, beverages and&#13;
tobacco 12/. Within this group, there is now much more variation with&#13;
regard to the total effective assistance estimates. It can also be seen&#13;
that these industries do not benefit from the three types of assistance&#13;
to the same extent. Export subsidy assistance is mainly provided for&#13;
"Meat products" and "Milk and dairy products". Domestic subsidy assist-&#13;
ance is mainly important for the grain processing industry. Furthermore&#13;
some sectors benefit heavily from tariff protection 31/. The latter&#13;
applies in particular to "Milk and dairy products" and the grain pro-&#13;
cessing industry.&#13;
Not all textile sectors are equally protected. While spinning&#13;
mills are hardly protected, the other three textile sectors benefit from&#13;
total effective assistance rates of more than twenty percent. Within&#13;
the paper industry, paper products are clearly more protected&#13;
than the paper industry proper. Within the sector "Chemicals" "Rubber&#13;
products" has an effective assistance of more than ten percent. Finally,&#13;
within "Transport equipment", the automobile industry turns out to be&#13;
heavily protected while "Other transport equipment", comprising mainly&#13;
of shipbuilding and manufacturing of aircraft, is not protected at all.&#13;
The domestic subsidy assistance in this case applies to shipbuilding only.&#13;
Altogether fourteen of the thirty two sectors have rates of total&#13;
effective assistance of more than ten percent. These fourteen sectors&#13;
account for sixteen percent of industrial gross value added at factor&#13;
costs and for twenty four percent of industrial employment. If we compare&#13;
the figures with the corresponding figures in section 2.2.1. we see that&#13;
the disaggregation of sectors reveals more protection. Again this pro-&#13;
tection is relatively employment directed.&#13;
Rates of effective assistance showed considerable differences amone&#13;
the various sectors. The average rate of assistance declined over the&#13;
years considered, but the variation among sectors did not g . The ranking&#13;
of sectors according to the level of assistance was more or less the same&#13;
for the years 1970 and 1976, but was different in 1975 33/.&#13;

2.3.   On the role of subsidies&#13;
It has already been mentioned that from 1975 onwards more attention&#13;
has been paid to restructuring the Dutch economy to meet deteriorating&#13;
industrial competitiveness problems. To this end the government granted&#13;
all kinds of financial support to industry, ranging from government-guaran-&#13;
teed loans through government participation in equity capital to subsidies&#13;
on wages or inyestment or research activities 34/ 35/.&#13;
Although the policy of supporting industry is now several years old,&#13;
it is still very difficult to get a clear picture of the types of support,&#13;
for which industries it has been given, how much has been spent and so on.&#13;
Few public sources provide information in this field. 36/ The infor-&#13;
mation from different sources is not always easy to reconcile. Besides,&#13;
not much sectoral detail is presented; at most 5 or 6 sectors are shown.&#13;
Several types of support are lumped together. The figures mostly refer&#13;
to commitments rather than expenditures. The two most important sources&#13;
of financial support, however, are clearly the Special Financing Arrangement&#13;
(SFA) and the Support from Employment Funds (SEF).&#13;
The SFA is implemented by the Netherlands Investment Bank (NIB).&#13;
The NIB, with slightly more than 50% state participation, specializes in&#13;
granting long term investment credits at its own risk. In cases where&#13;
the risk is too great, it may use the SFA, i.e. the request for credits&#13;
goes to the SFA committee, composed of representatives of the NIB, the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry under whose competence the requesting&#13;
firm comes. The criteria for application to the SFA are quite vague,&#13;
being formulated as follows:&#13;
- there is no other "acceptable" way of obtaining the necessary funds;&#13;
- the amount required cannot be provided by the firm itself or there&#13;
are liquidity problems;&#13;
- the firm is "basically sound".&#13;
When the request is granted, the NIB provides funds under government&#13;
guarantee. Only participations and credits are involved.&#13;
Another application of the SFA is the so-called "improper SFA". The&#13;
"improper SFA" is applied when the criteria mentioned above are not ful-&#13;
filled, but support is necessary to avoid sudden large dismissals of labour&#13;
34/ This section does not include EEC (CAP) export subsidies referred to in&#13;
sections 2.1 and 2.2.&#13;
35/ It is clear that the grant or subsidy element of these types of support&#13;
may range from 0 to 100 percent.&#13;
36/ The sources we use are:&#13;
- Parlementaire Subcommissie voor steunverlening individuele bedrijven&#13;
/ 28_/ which is a report on financial support to individual firms by&#13;
a subcommittee of the Second Chamber of Parliament. This is the most&#13;
comprehensive report on these matters available.&#13;
- Ministerie van Economische Zaken / 20_/, / 24_/.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
or to maintain so-called economically valuable production capacity. In&#13;
this case decisions in the SFA committee are taken by the government&#13;
representatives only.&#13;
The amount of credits supplied under the SFA has increased from&#13;
50 million guilders ($US 20 million) in 1973 to 750 million guilders&#13;
(US$ 306 million) in 1978. Altogether some 3 billion guilders ($US 1.2&#13;
billion) have been committed under this arrangement over the period 1973-&#13;
1978. The sectoral distribution is as follows:&#13;
Guilders&#13;
Metal industries                             1.000&#13;
(incl. shipbuilding,&#13;
aircraft manufacturing,&#13;
automobile industry)&#13;
Food processing industries                     450&#13;
Textile industry 37/                           400&#13;
Paper industry                                 200&#13;
Chemical industry                               50&#13;
Others (incl. non-industrial sectors)          900&#13;
These figures thus refer to guarantees. Actual losses under the SFA,&#13;
through bankruptcy, have increased from 13 million guilders ($US 5.3&#13;
million) in 1973 to 160 million guilders ($US 65.4 million) in 1978,&#13;
adding up to 300 million guilders ($US 122.6 million) for the whole period.&#13;
This total may increase with future defaults.&#13;
The other main source of funds in the seventies was the SEF faci-&#13;
lity. In this case the government supplied the funds directly from its&#13;
own budget. The objective of the SEF is to maintain employment and&#13;
increase the earning capacity of firms having temporary problems. To&#13;
qualify for funds from this source the problem has to be firm-specific,&#13;
temporary, and resulting from an unfortunate coincidence of market factors.&#13;
The quality of the management has to be good, and the firm has to be located&#13;
in a high unemployment region. Support may be of the following types:&#13;
credits, loans, guarantees, subsidies. The requests for support from the&#13;
SEF are administered and judged by an agency in the Ministry of Economic&#13;
Affairs. The Employment Committee, composed of representatives from the&#13;
Ministries of Economic Affairs, Social Affairs, Finance and Agriculture&#13;
and from the Netherlands Restructuring Company 38/ plays an advisory role.&#13;
The amounts supplied under SEF increased from 90 million guilders&#13;
($US36.8 million) in 1974 to about 1 billion ($US408.5million) in 1978.&#13;
Altogether almost 3 billion guilders ($US 1.2 billion) were committed over&#13;
this period. This was distributed as follows:&#13;
37/ It is not mentioned, in sources of our data. whether the textile&#13;
industry also includes clothing. It probably does.&#13;
38/ The Netherlands Restructuring Company will not be discussed here,&#13;
because it has no funds of its own. It plays an intermediary role&#13;
in the restructuring process.&#13;

The results of this type of support are not encouraging. At the end of&#13;
1979, one third of the firms that received support from the SEF in the&#13;
period 1975-1978, had gone bankrupt.&#13;
A number of smaller facilities also exist. The following are the&#13;
most interesting.&#13;
Two facilities, both particularly geared to promoting large,&#13;
high-risk, projects, where new technology is applied or new products are&#13;
marketed and it is only after some time that substantial employment stim-&#13;
uli and strengthening of the economic structure may be expected. One of&#13;
these facilities supplies credits only, while the other one provides all&#13;
kinds of financial support. Altogether some 240 million guilders ($US98.2&#13;
million) have been committed under the first facility, half of them for&#13;
the machine-industry, and some 140 million guilders ($US 57.2 million)&#13;
has been provided under the second facility. As might be expected, the&#13;
textile industry doen not feature amongst the recipients here.&#13;
Another facility links restructuring to development co-operation.&#13;
Here investment premiums are provided when a firm phases out production&#13;
capacity in the Netherlands and relocates production to a developing&#13;
country. Between 1975 and 1978, 55 million guilders ($US 22.25 million)&#13;
were provided, 43 million ($US17.6 million) being in the textile industry&#13;
and 10 million ($US4.1 million) in the wood industry.&#13;
Two facilities promote industries and firms with a high value&#13;
added content. These facilities are intended for sector policy purposes,&#13;
but it does not always work out that way. Firms in non-qualifying&#13;
sectors may still qualify. Between 1975 and 1978 850 million guilders&#13;
($US 347.3 million) committed for these facilities, of which, surprisingly,&#13;
some 300 million guilders ($US 122.6 million) went to the textile industry,&#13;
200 million ($US 81.7 million) to the paper industry, 100 million ($US 40.9&#13;
million) to basic metals, 50 million ($US 21 million) to machinery and&#13;
electronics and 30 million ($US 12.3 million)to the automobile industry.&#13;
Shipbuilding also receives separate support. The Ministry of&#13;
Economic Affairs finances 75% of the losses on shipbuilding orders,&#13;
amounting to over 100 million guilders ($US40.9 million) in both 1977&#13;
and 1978, and the same Ministry subsidizes the interest on longer term&#13;
export credits of the shipbuilding industry, also amounting to some&#13;
100 million ($US40.9 million) every year. However, there has been recent&#13;
restructuring in shipbuilding with capacity being reduced to fifty percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
since 1975 39/.&#13;
There are also some facilities for promoting regional distribution&#13;
of investment. Finally, there are some facilities in the field of export&#13;
promotion, e.g. the Matching Fund, which matches, to certain levels,&#13;
foreign export credit interest subsidies.&#13;
A varied collection of funds and agencies thus plays a role in&#13;
adjustment and assistance policies. The criteria for granting relief are&#13;
lacking, quite vague, or have been changing over time. The effects, for&#13;
example in terms of employment saved or created are not verifiable, but&#13;
it seems clear that the financial checks on the funds committed or money&#13;
spent are insufficient, and the support given on ad hoc grounds in crisis&#13;
situations seems almost certainly doomed to failure 40/.&#13;
Finally it should be said that the government has recognized many&#13;
of these points and is moving towards a less defensive and more forward&#13;
looking restructuring policy. It will be interesting to see whether it&#13;
will be able, in practice, to resist supporting employment per se, and&#13;
backward industries for employment's sake.&#13;
3.     POLICY MODELS OF PROTECTION&#13;
3.1.   Methodology&#13;
Models and variables&#13;
This chapter deals with the explanation of sectoral differences&#13;
in assistance rates, following the methodology developed by Caves I 4_I.&#13;
In his article on the explanation of Canada's tariff structure three&#13;
models are developed:&#13;
1. Adding Machine model&#13;
2. Interest Group model&#13;
3. National Policy model&#13;
In this paper two variants of each model are considered. In the&#13;
first variant of each model the choice of variables made by Caves is&#13;
followed as closely as is compatible with our data availability.&#13;
The first variant, therefore, will be referred to as the Caves-&#13;
variant. In the second variant the reasoning of the particular model&#13;
is maintained, but the choice of variables had been adapted in a way&#13;
likely more suitable for the Netherlands. Accbrdingly, this second&#13;
variant will be referred to as Netherlands variant. Both variants&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
appear under these names in the tables also. Each of the three models,&#13;
their variants and the corresponding variables are summarized below. A&#13;
detailed description of the data base can be found in ANNEX II.&#13;
The variable to be explained&#13;
The rate of effective assistance was taken, in accordance with&#13;
Caves 41/, to be the variable that had to be explained: "Because effective&#13;
rates measure the true net pulls on resource of manifest myopia in the&#13;
political process". Later on it is stated (p. 293), that the presence of&#13;
non-tariff barriers including administrative protection "is one reason for&#13;
modest expectations about the proportion of the variance of tariff rates&#13;
we could explain".&#13;
And indeed, in the case of the Netherlands, the figures in section&#13;
2.2 indicate the existence of a high rate of export subsidy assistance&#13;
for the food processing industries, clearly meant in the first place as a&#13;
compensation for the variable levies on imported agricultural inputs into&#13;
these sectors. This example points in the direction of the effective rate&#13;
rather than the nominal rate as the relevant dependent variable.&#13;
Furthermore, domestic assistance, being an almost negligible&#13;
(mostly negative) part of total protection in most sectors, nevertheless&#13;
adds in some cases significantly to tariff protection. This indicates,&#13;
in line with Caves, that total assistance rather than tariff protection&#13;
should be the variable to be explained.&#13;
For these reasons in this paper the rate of effective assistance&#13;
was taken as the dependent variable, rather than the rate of nominal&#13;
protection 42/. Nevertheless some regressions were run with the rate of&#13;
nominal protection as the dependent variable.&#13;
The Adding Machine Model&#13;
In the Adding Machine model it is supposed, that protection is&#13;
given by the government, whose only goal is to maximize the probability&#13;
of its re-election. In this view the differences in protection or&#13;
assistance rates among sectors should be attributed to intersectoral&#13;
differences that affect possible contributions to such re-election.&#13;
Caves 43/ himself expresses some doubts about the realism of this hy-&#13;
pothesis: "Infrequent elections mean that the government presents the&#13;
electorate with a package of measures, in force or intended. The voters&#13;
cannot disentangle the bundle...". There is room for some unpopular&#13;
policy measures, therefore, also in the field of assistance granting,&#13;
if this is an important election issue at all.&#13;
In the case of the Netherlands this line of reasoning is further&#13;
complicated by the fact that governments consist of changing coalitions&#13;
of parties with different rank and files, and further, that an impor-&#13;
tant part of the protection policy is decided upon at the EEC-level.&#13;

42/ See section 2.1 for this distinction.&#13;
43/ R.E. Caves, / 4_/, p. 282.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Caves distinguishes two main aspects of the Adding Machine effect:&#13;
1. The number of votes, that can be won, or, what is perhaps more&#13;
important, can be prevented from being lost, from the workforce&#13;
in a particular sector.&#13;
2. The publicity effect, on regional and/or economic neighbours of&#13;
the sector considered. In this way the government also aims at&#13;
attracting voters from these groups.&#13;
Caves chooses value added per worker (VAPW) as the proxy represent-&#13;
ing the number of votes that is at stake. The expected sign of the coef-&#13;
ficient is negative, because the higher VAPW, the less employment will be&#13;
saved per unit of protected value added.&#13;
The publicity element in the Adding Machine model is expressed by&#13;
Caves with the aid of four variables. Three variables represent a&#13;
sector's concentration in large firms: the share of the four largest firms&#13;
in total sales (CR 4); transport costs of a sector's output and hence its&#13;
natural tendency towards concentration (TRN), a tendency also reflected by&#13;
a variable representing economies of scale (MSC). The fourth variable&#13;
relates to an index of regional concentration (GEG). In the Adding&#13;
Machine model a high concentration in firms or regions is thought to&#13;
influence negatively the level of assistance.&#13;
The Caves-variant&#13;
In the Caves-variant the VAPW variable is maintained. The first&#13;
concentration variable, CR4, has been replaced, due to lack of data, by&#13;
a measure of industrial concentration according to the Herfindahl index&#13;
(HERF). This index measures the dispersion of the total number of firms&#13;
over size classes. TRN is deleted, because transport costs do not play&#13;
as important a role in the Netherlands as in Canada. Because of the&#13;
lack of data the variable MSC could not be measured in Caves' manner and&#13;
is therefore replaced by another scale-variable, SCALE. The regional&#13;
concentration index GEG is maintained.&#13;
The Netherlands-variant&#13;
According to the reasoning of the Adding Machine model it is the&#13;
number of votes that counts; votes to be won or votes prevented from&#13;
being lost. For that reason, perhaps total sectoral employment should&#13;
be taken as the relevant variable. The amount of employment, however,&#13;
differs among sectors simply as a result of disaggregation. To illus-&#13;
trate this for the Netherlands a sector with a small number of employees&#13;
- such as clothing - may be protected more heavily than a sector such as&#13;
chemicals, notwithstanding the latter's much larger employment. Two&#13;
considerations are of importance here. Firstly, protection is generally&#13;
granted for products rather than for sectors. This implies that in fact&#13;
the votes should be considered in connection with the employment in a&#13;
specific product group or sub-sector and not in a sector. But sub-&#13;
sectors are usually identified with a broader sector: for instance&#13;
"spinning" is associated with the textile sector. And it is this&#13;
broader sector, that is thought to be in need of protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
'This brings us to the second point, namely, that it is not only a&#13;
sector's employment that is considered as potential vote creation, but&#13;
rather the extent to which the employees are threatened by unemployment.&#13;
To take account of this aspect, the change in a sector's employment over&#13;
a 5 year period has been considered relevant. In other words the impor-&#13;
tance of a sector to the government as a source of votes is increased in&#13;
the case of a decline in that sector's employment. To this end in the&#13;
variable EAM, both a sector's employment, and declines in employment are combined.&#13;
In the Netherlands-variant the concentration of a sector in firms&#13;
is merely represented by the variable NOF, the number of firms, because&#13;
it is numbers that count in the Adding Machine model. NOF has a positive&#13;
expected sign. The variable GEG, the index for regional concentration,&#13;
is maintained, with a negative sign to be expected.&#13;
A detailed description of the variables, their sources and units&#13;
of measurement are to be found in ANNEX II. In this section table 7&#13;
contains a summary of the models, the variables and the predicted signs.&#13;
The Interest Group Model&#13;
In the Interest Group model it is stressed that economic groups&#13;
(that is, producers, consumers and the government) experience benefits&#13;
or losses from a sector's protection. When a sector is protected its&#13;
producers benefit from its protection, and so do its suppliers, but not&#13;
its buyers. Consumers will generally oppose protection, governments are&#13;
likely to favour some tariff protection to increase their income, but&#13;
generally both will not be interested as to which specific sector is&#13;
protected.&#13;
Caves supposes, however, that the consumers' influence to oppose&#13;
protection will not be very strong. Protection is generally given on&#13;
a product level with little bearing on the consumers' budget. On the&#13;
other hand consumers might favour increasing government revenues in&#13;
this way.&#13;
This leaves demand for and opposition against,protection in this&#13;
model with the producers alone. The way they are inclined to seek&#13;
protection and spend time and money in this process depends on the&#13;
economic position of the sector. If a sector flourishes, every hour&#13;
spent in the lobbying process for protection involves high opportunity&#13;
costs in terms of time lost in the production process. On the other&#13;
hand, economically weak industries may be inclined to spend a good deal&#13;
of time and money so as to obtain protection.&#13;
To what extent a sector's bid for protection is successful depends&#13;
on that sectors' power in negotiations; among other factors this is&#13;
strongly influenced by that sector's degree of concentration, that is,&#13;
the number of firms. The more concentrated in a few firms, the stronger&#13;
can be the lobby-pressure, Caves supposes. High concentration also&#13;
diminishes the free-rider problem of firms that leave the trouble of&#13;
acquiring protection to the large firms nevertheless enjoying the bene-&#13;
fits. On the other hand, some sectors with a low degree of concentration&#13;
can be organized in a strong interest group, which may have considerable&#13;
negotiating power.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Caves chooses the following variables for negotiating power:&#13;
CR 4    as in the Adding Machine model, this is the share of the&#13;
four largest firms in total sales&#13;
MSC     a scale variable, measuring a sector's natural tendency&#13;
to be concentrated&#13;
BCR     buyers opposition to a sector's protection.&#13;
The economic situation of a sector is accounted for by four&#13;
variables by Caves:&#13;
GRO     measures the growth of sales as an expression of the&#13;
economic well-being of a sector&#13;
NSP     measures the product diversification in a sector, to&#13;
reflect a sector's vulnerability to competition&#13;
VAPW    value added per worker; the higher VAPW the higher the&#13;
opportunity cost for lobbying and also the lower the&#13;
need for protection&#13;
TRN     measures the transport costs of a sector's output, and&#13;
like MSC gives an indication of that sector's natural&#13;
tendency to be concentrated.  As such it belongs to the&#13;
first group. More importantly, high transport costs&#13;
imply a natural protection against foreign competition.&#13;
The Caves-variant&#13;
The CR 4 variable is replaced by the Herfindahl index for indus-&#13;
trial concentration (HERF) as in the Adding Machine model. The MSC&#13;
variable is again replaced by SCALE, to reflect economies of scale.&#13;
Both variables, HERF and SCALE, are supposed to have a positive effect&#13;
on the lobbying process for protection. But according to Caves, the&#13;
positive expected sign of the HERF-variable has a question mark in this&#13;
variant, indicating the possibility that highly unconcentrated sectors&#13;
have been organized in a strong interest group. The variable BCR -&#13;
for buyers' opposition has been maintained.&#13;
For the situation of the industry, GRO is maintained and so is&#13;
VAPW, both with a negative expected sign, as explained above. NSP, an&#13;
index for product diversification, is not available in the data material;&#13;
TRN, transport costs, could better be replaced by a variable that&#13;
measures a sector's mobility (MOB) to express better the idea of natural&#13;
protection against foreign competition. Unfortunately the data for this&#13;
variable were also not available.&#13;
The Netherlands-variant&#13;
The variables HERF and BCR are maintained. The variable CR4 for&#13;
industrial concentration measures the share of the four largest firms&#13;
in total output, while the Herfindahl index measures the concentration&#13;
of all firms in an industry according to size classes. For that reason&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
CR4 is insensitive to whether a sector's output outside the four largest&#13;
firms stems from a few other big firms or from many small industries.&#13;
But the Herfindahl index will show less concentration in the latter case.&#13;
Hence the Herfindahl index is more sensitive to the existence of econo-&#13;
mies of scale within a sector than CR4. For that reason, when the HERF&#13;
variable is included, there seems to be only little need for an additional&#13;
scale variable to represent industrial concentration.&#13;
A distinction can be made with respect to the kind of assistance&#13;
available: tariffs or subsidies, to mention the most important elements&#13;
of assistance. Tariffs, unless they are reviewed yearly, have more of&#13;
a stock-character, while subsidies correspond more closely to a flow&#13;
concept. In the case of tariffs therefore, with their more permanent&#13;
character, there should be a connection with the innate determinants of&#13;
a sector's comparative advantage, like skill intensity (SKILL), labour&#13;
intensity, measured here as the ratio of employment to value added IWPVA),&#13;
and outlays for research and development (R&amp;D).&#13;
Subsidies, with their more temporary character, should then be&#13;
connected more with the revealed comparative advantage or performance&#13;
of an industry, measured for instance by an indicator for growth (GRO)&#13;
and the rate of return.&#13;
As tariffs play the most important role in the structure of&#13;
assistance in the Netherlands shown in section 2.2, the variables&#13;
SKILL and WPVA were selected in the Netherlands-variant. For the&#13;
variable R&amp;D no data were available.&#13;
A detailed description of the variables, their sources and units&#13;
of measurement are to be found in ANNEX II. Table 7 in this section&#13;
again contains a summary of the models, the variables and the predicted&#13;
signs.&#13;
The National Policy model&#13;
Caves' National Policy model is meant to take account of national&#13;
preferences with regard to the industrial structure. Caves states 44/:&#13;
"We can thus consider what structural traits of manufacturing industries&#13;
might make them attractive or unattractive to a nationalistic preference&#13;
function for the output composition of the manufacturing sector". And,&#13;
on the same page: "To implement such a preference, tariff rates must&#13;
offset the difference between production costs at home and abroad".&#13;
According to Caves the preference function with respect to the&#13;
industrial structure may consist of the following elements, some more&#13;
connected with national wealth, others with more nationalistic prefer-&#13;
ences:&#13;
44/ R.E. Caves, /4_7, p. 289.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
RPR     this variable measures differences in productivity between&#13;
Canada and its most important partner in trade: the US&#13;
NPC     measures the share of middle class people in a sector's&#13;
employment to take account of the wish to protect this group&#13;
VRT     defined as the value added share in production.   Sectors with&#13;
high VRT are beneficial to national well-being and hence&#13;
likely to attract protection.&#13;
VAPW    value added per worker, a variable introduced in this model&#13;
to reflect the connection of national esteem or prestige&#13;
with a sector with a high VAPW&#13;
MSC     this scale variable is also meant to reflect national esteem&#13;
connected with large plants&#13;
GRO     on the same grounds as with the VRT variable fast growing&#13;
sectors will be protected&#13;
GEG     in this model it is thought to be of advantage for a sector&#13;
to attract protection, when it is located in one of the&#13;
richer or economically stronger regions.&#13;
The Caves-variant&#13;
In the Netherlands it is very difficult to measure the differences&#13;
in productivity between domestic producers and foreign competitors. Prin-&#13;
cipal trading partners vary with products and sectors. Many of the most&#13;
important trading partners are within the EEC, where protection has been&#13;
abolished.  The import penetration of the Dutch market from outside the&#13;
EEC (MPNEC) has been chosen as the variable to represent the revealed&#13;
differences in productivity with trade partners. The expected sign is&#13;
positive: the higher the market penetration, the more (call for) protec-&#13;
tion.&#13;
Protection of the middle class group in employment is thought not&#13;
to be relevant in the Dutch case. On the other hand the protection of&#13;
farmers is presumably of some importance. For that reason, a sector's&#13;
intermediate deliveries from the agricultural sector in relation to&#13;
production was taken as a variable (FARM) to represent this. The vari-&#13;
ables VRT and GRO are maintained, and as in previous models, the MSC&#13;
variable has been replaced by SCALE. With these variables included, it&#13;
seems superfluous to add the value added per worker (VAPW), while the&#13;
value added aspect is represented in VRT and the SCALE variable is&#13;
supposed to take account of the prestige aspect.&#13;
To approximate the meaning of a regional concentration variable&#13;
in this model more closely, the variable for regional spread in general&#13;
(GEG) has been replaced by REGRI, which measures a sector's concentra-&#13;
tion in relatively strong regions; the expected sign is positive.&#13;
The Netherlands-variant&#13;
Instead of measuring revealed differences in productivity with&#13;
trade partners by foreign import penetration alone (MPNEC), the Dutch&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
export position on non-EEC markets should also be taken into account to&#13;
obtain a more complete picture of a sector's sales. Import penetration&#13;
from outside the EEC and export performance on non-EEC markets are combined&#13;
as a ratio to production in the variable CNEC.&#13;
FARM, VRT, GRO, SCALE and REGRI are maintained in this variant. A&#13;
variahle to represent labour intensity of production has been added (EINT).&#13;
In coimection with the predicted positive sign for the variables VRT, GRO&#13;
and REGRI to reflect a tendency to support flourishing sectors, it could&#13;
be. expected that labour intensity will have a negative sign, the labour-&#13;
intensive sectors being among the sectors growing slowly or stagnating.&#13;
But it is also possible that is is government policy - related to the&#13;
Adding Machine idea - to protect employment. This is particularly im-&#13;
portant when employment is located in relatively weak regions. Negative&#13;
signs for the variables EINT and REGRI are therefore also conceivable.&#13;
This amounts to saying, that government policy may be to protect strong&#13;
sectors in strong regions or to do the opposite, or to aim at both results&#13;
for different sectors. The National Policy model therefore, as formalized&#13;
here, is not unambiguous with respect to predicted signs.&#13;
A detailed description of the variables can be found in ANNEX II.&#13;
A summary of this model is represented in table 7 in this section.&#13;
IBRD Common Set&#13;
Within the framework of the IBRD project on market penetration&#13;
and protection several meetings have been held with all country partici-&#13;
pants to discuss intermediate results and to coordinate further research.&#13;
During one of these meetings it was suggested that for all countries par-&#13;
ticipating in the project, a common set of variables (IBRD Common Set)&#13;
should be run to explain intersectoral differences in protection as&#13;
follows: 45/&#13;
VAPW    Value added per worker.   In line with the Adding Machine and&#13;
Interest Group models the expected sign would be negative, but&#13;
in the National Policy model a positive sign is thought possible.&#13;
INSH and&#13;
EXSH     are respectively the import share of domestic consumption and the&#13;
share of exports in production. In the case of the Netherlands&#13;
these variables have been replaced by the import penetration from&#13;
outside the EEC (MPNEC) and by the exports to outside the EEC as&#13;
a share of production (EXNEC). The predicted signs are positive&#13;
for MPNEC and negative for EXNEC.&#13;
NOF      Number of firms.   According to the Adding Machine model this&#13;
variable should have a positive sign, but in view of prestige&#13;
considerations, it should probably have a negative sign in the&#13;
National Policy model. No decision, therefore, was made with respect&#13;
to the predicted sign.&#13;

extensive sectors could also be supported. So no sign predic-&#13;

DNOE   The change in the number of employees.   The sectors with growing&#13;
employment might be protected for that reason. But in line with&#13;
the ambiguity in the National Policy model, a negative sign could&#13;
also be predicted here, as it seems more likely that protection&#13;
would be given to curtail employment losses.&#13;
Specification 45/&#13;
In the presentation ofCthe models it has been assumed throughout,&#13;
implicitly, that it should be tested which model best explains the&#13;
intersectoraldifferences in assistance rates. However, it could be argued,&#13;
that presumably various ways of reasoning are followed in the process of&#13;
acquiring and granting protection. Furthermore, it is likely, that the&#13;
importance of the various reasons changes over time and among the&#13;
sectors concerned.&#13;
Actually, some of the variables proposed, appearing in more than&#13;
one model, with the same predicted sign, can be regarded as a connection&#13;
between the models.&#13;
Another complication in the case of the Netherlands is that part&#13;
of the protection measures is decided upon at the EC level. Also this&#13;
sheds some doubt on the assumption, that Dutch production and distribu-&#13;
tion characteristics of manufacturing sectors would allow for an expla-&#13;
nation of the intersectoral structure of protection. In fact it could&#13;
be argued that for this reason it would be preferable to explain only&#13;
the domestic part of total assistance (i.e. domestic subsidies minus&#13;
taxes) with the aid of domestic sectoral characteristics. But it has&#13;
been mentioned before that domestic assistance is of some importance in&#13;
a few sectors only. Furthermore, it seems reasonable to assume that&#13;
domestic assistance is rendered to increase protection at the EC level&#13;
up to a desired degree of total protection. This can take the form of&#13;
granting subsidies to counteract existing negative protection caused by&#13;
protected inputs. This is the case in the food processing industries&#13;
where subsidies compensating for variable levies on agricultural inputs&#13;
are rendered. And that, not domestically but already at the EC level.&#13;
In other cases domestically granted subsidies could merely add to&#13;
already positive EC protection, which might be considered to be too low.&#13;
In both instances total assistance, not domestic assistance would&#13;
represent the proper level of protection to be explained.&#13;
Furthermore, both sides of the regression equations contain&#13;
variables measured at the same point in time. No attempt has been made&#13;
to account for the appropriate time lags involved. The latter would&#13;

require disentangling relations of the following kind: a rising market&#13;
penetration through imports evokes more protection with the result that&#13;
the market penetration goes down, or more ambiguously: grows less fast.&#13;
More insights into these complicated processes would require more&#13;
research into the historical background of the granting of protective&#13;
measures, perhaps even at the product level.&#13;
Such a time-consuming undertaking not being possible, the three&#13;
models according to Caves, and the IBRD variant have been tested for&#13;
each of the years 1970, 1975 and 1976 for the 17 manufacturing sectors.&#13;
In view of the scarcity of observations a linear form of the relationships&#13;
was used.&#13;
A constant term has been added so as to take account of a con-&#13;
ceivable ceteris paribus rise or decline in assistance rates over time.&#13;
3.2    Results for 1970, 1975 and 1976&#13;
3.2.1. The policy models&#13;
The results are examined according to the following criteria:&#13;
1. Sign of the estimated coefficient. It will be seen whether&#13;
the estimated sign is in accordance with its prediction. If&#13;
this turns out not to be the case, it will be concluded that&#13;
the original hypothesis as it has been formalized is not&#13;
supported by empirical results.&#13;
2. Variance.  The coefficient of determination (R ) is presented,&#13;
together with its value corrected for degrees of freedom (R72).&#13;
3. Significance of the estimations.&#13;
Significance of the estimated coefficients individually is&#13;
expressed by the t-ratio's and for the group of coefficients&#13;
as a whole by the F-statistic. Both indicators will be&#13;
presented.&#13;
For each of the models the results are presented separately in tables&#13;
8, 9, 10, and 11. These tables give only a summary of the results.&#13;
A detailed description can be found in ANNEX III.&#13;
Adding Machine&#13;
The results for the Adding Machine model are summarized in table&#13;
8. Both the results for the Caves-variant and for the Netherlands-&#13;
variant are presented.&#13;
In the Caves-variant the signs of the coefficients are the same&#13;
for the three years considered. But the sign for the indices of&#13;
sectoral concentration (HERF) are consistently different from the pre-&#13;
dicted sign. For other variables signs are as expected, but the coef-&#13;
ficients of determination are low and so is the level of significance.&#13;
In the Netherlands-variant of the Adding Machine model the&#13;
variable for sectoral concentration (NOF) gives signs that are opposite&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
to the predicted ones, and as in the Caves variant, consistently so for&#13;
all three years. In the Netherlands variant the coefficients of deter-&#13;
mination are somewhat higher than in the Caves variant, but significance&#13;
is low again.&#13;
With the proviso that the data can be assumed to be adequate (in&#13;
the sense that they actually measure what they are supposed to measure,&#13;
and that the specification of the relation is correct with respect to&#13;
form, time-lag structure etc.), it can be concluded that the empirical&#13;
evidence does not give very much support to the Adding Machine model.&#13;
Interest Group&#13;
The results for the Interest Group model are summarized in table&#13;
9. In the Caves-variant the sign of the coefficient for the index of&#13;
sectoral concentration (HERF) changes over time. Actually, for this&#13;
variable the predicted sign was +?, because it was thought, that a&#13;
highly dispensed sector could also exercise a strong influence in the&#13;
lobby-process, if there was good coordination in a collective organiza-&#13;
tion. But this does not imply that, given the fair stability in inter-&#13;
sectoral differences in assistance rates 47/ and in the degree of con-&#13;
centration, changes in sign are to be expected over the years.   Further-&#13;
more, the coefficients of the scale-variable (SCALE) and value added&#13;
per worker (VAPW) also show changes in sign over the years, the coeffi-&#13;
cients of determination are low and so is the level of significance.&#13;
As in the case of the Adding Machine model the results for the&#13;
Netherlands-variant are slightly better according to the coefficients&#13;
of determination. But also here, the signs of the coefficients change:&#13;
in this case for the variables representing opposition from buyers (BCR)&#13;
and skill-intensity (SKILL). The variable WPVA has a consistently&#13;
positive influence, which is significant at the 95% level in one year,&#13;
when the F-statistic also shows significance at the 95% confidence level.&#13;
Notwithstanding this relatively significant result for the&#13;
Netherlands variant in one year, for the model as a whole, the results&#13;
do not very much support the Interest Group model, with of course the&#13;
same provisoes as mentioned with the Adding Machine model.&#13;

National Policy&#13;
The regression results for the National Policy model are summarized&#13;
in table 10. It is striking that in the Caves-variant the signs of the&#13;
coefficients of the value added share of production (VRT) and growth of&#13;
sales (GRO) are both negative, contrary to their predicted signs. This&#13;
applies also to concentration in relatively strong regions (REGRI) which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
is expected to be positively related to protection, but turns out to be&#13;
the opposite. The variable for the intermediate deliveries from agri-&#13;
culture (FARM) is positive only in 1975, the year in which the food&#13;
industries were highly protected. The coefficient for the import pene-&#13;
tration from outside the EEC is negative in 1970, contrary to expecta-&#13;
tion. The coefficients of determination are somewhat better than in&#13;
the previous models but are still rather low; the significance of the&#13;
estimations remains poor.&#13;
In the Netherlands-variant of the National Policy model the esti-&#13;
mated sign of the VRT-variable again differs from the expected sign,&#13;
being negative and significantly so in 1975. In that year the FARM-&#13;
variable shows a positive influence, as in the Caves variant. The&#13;
growth variable (GRO) displays a changing sign pattern. It seems that&#13;
the variable for the competitive position (CNEC) performs somewhat&#13;
better than the variables for the import penetration (MPNEC) in the&#13;
Caves-variant. In the Netherlands-variant the labour-intensity variable&#13;
(EINT) is consistently positive; this may indicate that labour is pro-&#13;
tected rather than labour-extensive production. As in the previous&#13;
variant the concentration in rich regions (REGRI) shows a consistently&#13;
negative sign; this may even point in the direction of protection of&#13;
poor regions.&#13;
In connection with the sign expectations in the Netherlands&#13;
variant of this model it has already been noted that government behav-&#13;
ior might be ambiguous in the sense that strong sectors would be pro-&#13;
tected but that weak sectors would attract protection at the same time.&#13;
The results for the National Policy model point in the direction of&#13;
the latter, namely protection of economically weak sectors in depressed&#13;
regions, but there is also some evidence for the opposite.&#13;
The results of the Netherlands variant seem to indicate that&#13;
sectors characterised by economies of scale (SCALE) are protected.&#13;
This result is supported by positive signs for industrial concentration&#13;
in previous models. This would be in line with the observation in&#13;
section 1.3 that after World War II industrial development in the&#13;
Netherlands was characterised by an emphasis on large scale industries.&#13;
For the National Policy model as a whole the changes in signs&#13;
are too frequent and the level of significance is generally too poor&#13;
in both variants to give much support to the model as it has been&#13;
specified.&#13;

IBRD Common Set&#13;
The results for the IBRD Common Set are represented in table 11.&#13;
It is striking that the coefficients for the import penetration (MPNEC)&#13;
and export performance (EXNEC) both show consistently the opposite of&#13;
the expected signs. A simple explanation suggests that the more sectors&#13;
are protected, the less foreign competition they experience. But then&#13;
foreign competition should be regarded as a result of protection and&#13;
does not give an explanation of it.&#13;
It seems more reasonable to assume that foreign competition is&#13;
likely to play a role as a reason for protection. A more complicated&#13;
lag-structure than that assumed seem likely. It is conceivable that&#13;
protection succeeded in hampering import penetration. What is measured&#13;
would be the result of this process.&#13;
But, if such a process were to occur, it would cover years in&#13;
which the intended reduction in import penetration would not yet have&#13;
been realized. In those years assistance is built up to increase pro-&#13;
tection against foreign competition.   In such years the results would&#13;
show signs for import penetration and export performance as expected.&#13;
As the present results refer to three years out of seven years, it&#13;
is unlikely that these would be the years in which such a - as yet&#13;
hypothetical - process would have come to an end. This observation&#13;
is underlined by preliminary calculations, where instead of import&#13;
penetration from outside the EEC only import penetration from develo-&#13;
ping countries, or the increase in import penetration has been taken&#13;
as an explanatory variable. Import penetration variables, contrary to&#13;
expectations, consistently had negative signs. This notwithstanding&#13;
the relatively satisfactory values of the coefficients of determination&#13;
it is doubtful whether much value can be attached to the explanatory&#13;
power of this group of variables.&#13;

Conclusion with respect to the policy models&#13;
The results presented thus far do not really support hypotheses&#13;
about causes of intersectoral differences in assistance-rates as expressed&#13;
in the policy models 48/. As stated before, this however needs some qua-&#13;
lifications: the conclusion should be regarded as drawn with respect to&#13;
the specification of the models and with respect to the kind of data used.&#13;
That is, the form of the relationship, the specification of the time lags,&#13;
the choice of the variables representing the elements of the hypotheses&#13;
and the data chosen to measure these variables, may be each in itself more&#13;
or less inappropriate to test the hypotheses.&#13;
48/ This conclusion can be extended to the results with nominal protection&#13;
rather than effective assistance as the dependent variable.    These&#13;
results, represented in ANNEX III, indicate that for all models, except&#13;
Adding Machine, R2 and t-ratio's improved somewhat, but that signs of&#13;
coefficient deviated at least as much from expectations as in the&#13;
results for effective assistance. The same conclusion, i.e. only&#13;
little support for the policy models, can also be drawn from calcula-&#13;
tions for the 32-sector case in the year 1975. Because of the incom-&#13;
pleteness of data at this level of disaggregation, these calculations,&#13;
however, are only preliminary.&#13;

3.2.2. Selection of variables&#13;
Notwithstanding the rather negative conclusion of the preceding&#13;
section about the policy models, the regression results reveal some&#13;
interesting features about a number of variables. In connection with&#13;
the National Policy model, as already mentioned, there is some evidence,&#13;
that large scale industries attract some protection.&#13;
There seems to be even more support for another observation,&#13;
namely that weak sectors are protected especially when located in eco-&#13;
nomically weak regions. The following point in that direction.&#13;
In the Adding Machine model the variable value added per worker&#13;
(VAPW) shows a consistently negative sign in the Caves-variant, while,&#13;
for the variable for employment threatened (EAM) a positive coefficient&#13;
is found in all results for the Netherlands-variant, where it is signi-&#13;
ficant or close to it.&#13;
In the Interest Group model the growth variable (GRO) shows a&#13;
negative sign in the Caves-variant and worker per value added (WPVA)&#13;
shows a positive sign in the Netherlands-variant and is significant or&#13;
close to it.&#13;
In the National Policy model the variable GRO is negative in the&#13;
Caves-variant, while in the Netherlands-variant the value added variable&#13;
(VRT) is negative and sometimes significant. Furthermore labour inten-&#13;
sity (EINT) has a positive sign. In both variants concentration in rich&#13;
regions has a negative influence on assistance, as indicated by the&#13;
negative sign for the variable REGRI. As stated before, this may indi-&#13;
cate that concentration in poor regions (REGPO) is favourable to attract-&#13;
ing assistance rather than concentration in rich regions.&#13;
From the results for the National Policy model it can further be&#13;
concluded that the variable FARM only has some significance in 1975,&#13;
which is the only year of the three considered with considerable assist-&#13;
ance for the food industry.&#13;
The slowly growing sectors being mostly the relatively labour&#13;
intensive ones and vice-versa, it is interesting to select some variables&#13;
representing labour intensity in one form or another, and the concen-&#13;
tration in poor regions. For the representation of labour intensity&#13;
the variable WPVA (worker per value added) was chosen rather than EAM,&#13;
because the latter turned out to be less correlated with the dependent&#13;
variable and more with the explanatory variable REGPO, which is the&#13;
appropriate variable for the concentration in relatively weak regions.&#13;
In addition to this the variable FARM was selected to take&#13;
account of the high protection of the food-industries in 1975.&#13;
The results of the exercises with this selection of variables&#13;
are summarized in table 12.&#13;

Table 12 indicates that the variables WPVA and REGPO give a&#13;
reasonably good explanation for the intersectoral differences in&#13;
assistance rates, conforming with the predicted signs, being con-&#13;
sistent over the years, and having significant values for the&#13;
coefficients of determination. This observation holds less for&#13;
1970, but all variants of the policy models performed poorly for&#13;
this year. The variable FARM adds some explanation for the year&#13;
1975, when the food industry was heavily protected. The strong&#13;
performance of the WPVA variable reinforces the observation in&#13;
section 2.2 that protection seems to be employment directed.&#13;
In conclusion, although there was some evidence that firms&#13;
with economies of scale are protected in the National Policy model&#13;
- an observation in line with the process of industrialisation in&#13;
the Netherlands after World War II - the results of this section,&#13;
given the selection of variables, indicate that protection in the&#13;
seventies was positively associated with labour intensive pro-&#13;
duction and location in depressed areas.&#13;

4.     Summary&#13;
The rates of effective assistance in 17 industrial sectors in the&#13;
Netherlands were estimated for 1970, 1975 and 1976. Assistance included&#13;
the effects of four categories of distortive economic policies: tariffs,&#13;
subsidies, taxes and variable levies. The EEC as a whole was taken as&#13;
the protected market in calculating the rates of effective assistance.&#13;
Non-tradables were treated according to Balassa's method. The results&#13;
probably underestimate real effective assistance to some extent, because&#13;
not all subsidies could be taken into account, due to lack of data.&#13;
The results show that the share of manufacturing industry output&#13;
that had a rate of effective assistance of more than 10 percent gradually&#13;
fell over the years. The number of sectors with a rate of effective&#13;
assistance of more than 10 percent amounted to 7 out of 17 in 1970 but&#13;
was only 4 in 1975 and 1976. The share of these sectors in gross value&#13;
added of total manufacturing decreased from 35 percent in 1970, to 11&#13;
percent in 1975 and it was only 7 percent in 1976. The shares of these&#13;
sectors in total employment in manufacturing industry were higher, but&#13;
also fell from 43 percent in 1970 to 17 percent in 1975 and 11 percent&#13;
in 1976. Except in food processing, total assistance mainly consisted&#13;
of tariff protection.&#13;
The average rate of effective assistance clearly declined, falling&#13;
from 12 percent in 1970 to 11 percent in 1975 and 8 percent in 1976. In&#13;
all the-three years considered, food products, beverages and tobacco,&#13;
textiles and clothing were among the most protected sectors.&#13;
Rates of effective assistance were also calculated for 32 indus-&#13;
trial sectors for 1975. The results show much more variation among&#13;
sectors in total effective assistance. This holds in particular for&#13;
the group of food, beverages and tobacco industries. The disaggregation&#13;
of sectors suggested that a larger share of manufacturing industry -&#13;
17 sectors had effective assistance of more than 10 percent. Fourteen&#13;
of the 32 sectors had rates of total effective assistance of more than&#13;
10 percent. These 14 sectors accounted for 16 percent of gross value&#13;
added and 24 percent of employment in Dutch manufacturing industry in&#13;
1975.&#13;
The differences in protection among sectors have been analyzed&#13;
according to the adding machine, interest group and national policy&#13;
models. In addition a number of regressions were run using variables&#13;
which seemed more appropriate for the Netherlands and a set common to&#13;
this group of studies.&#13;
The performance of the various models or sets of variables has&#13;
been judged by three criteria: whether the regression coefficients&#13;
showed the expected sign, the levels of significance of the estimations&#13;
and the values of the coefficients of determination.&#13;
The results obtained give only limited support to the Caves&#13;
models in explaining intersectoral differences in effective assistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
in Dutch manufacturing industry. If variables which seem more appropriate&#13;
for the case of the Netherlands are used, the results improve somewhat, but&#13;
still do not really support the models.&#13;
The "common" variables perform somewhat better with respect to the&#13;
coefficients of determination.. The signs of the estimated coefficients&#13;
are, however, for some crucial variables opposite to those expected signs.&#13;
The variables that give the best results represent a sector's&#13;
labour intensity and its degree of concentration in poor regions: thus&#13;
in Dutch manufacturing industry more effective assistance is given to rela-&#13;
tively labour intensive sectors located in relatively depressed areas,&#13;

ANNEX I. DATA SOURCES FOR THE ESTIMATION OF THE EFFECTIVE RATES OF ASSISTANCE&#13;
For the calculation of the effective rates of assistance use has been&#13;
made of the input-output_tables published by the Dutch Central Bureau of&#13;
Statistics (CBS) / 5, 6 _. Unpublished data, kindly provided by the CBS,&#13;
were also used.&#13;
The published data concern:&#13;
Vi           : wage costs plus depreciation plus other income&#13;
X_           : domestic output&#13;
Ej           : exports, valued at world market prices&#13;
X.'j         : intermediate deliveries of tradables&#13;
Xkj          : intermediate deliveries of non-tradables&#13;
Xj, KX,  Xkj   were all valued at producers' prices&#13;
-k           : indirect taxes minus subsidies as a percentage of the&#13;
value of output of non-tradables&#13;
a.ik a"M : percentage inputs of tradables. and non-tradables&#13;
respectively in non-tradables&#13;
The. data provided by the CBS were:&#13;
ti           : nominal rate of tariff protection; t  is calculated as&#13;
duties collected divided by similar lpmorts from third&#13;
countries&#13;
ni           : nominal rate of variable levy protection; ni is calculated&#13;
as levies collected divided by competing farm imports from&#13;
third countries&#13;
Ej          : excise taxes as a percentage of the value of output&#13;
An extended input-output table for 1975 for 54 sectors, was provided by&#13;
the CBS.&#13;

            On protectionism in the Netherlands
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The paper is introduced by a bird's
            eye view of developments in industry and trade since World
            War II. Changes in the structure of industrial production as
            well as shifts in industrial policies due to changing
            objectives of socioeconomic policy are discussed. Trade
            policies, in particular their protectionist aspects, are
            considered. Total assistance consists of four types of
            protectionist measures: tariffs, subsidies, taxes and
            variable levies. Estimates were made for 17 industrial
            sectors of Dutch manufacturing industry for the years 1970,
            1975 and 1976. This corresponds to the level of aggregation
            of the Netherlands input-output tables. For the year 1975
            similar estimates are also presented for 32 industrial
            sectors, use being made of an unpublished input-output
            table. Special attention is given to the role of subsidies
            in Dutch economic policy. The differences in assistance
            among sectors are analyzed for each of the available years.
            This is done with the aid of the three models of political
            economy: the adding machine, interest group and national
            policy models. The paper concludes with a brief summary of
            the results obtained.
