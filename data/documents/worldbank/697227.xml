INSTITUTION BUILDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
I. Background&#13;
1.           Azerbaijan covers an area of 86,000 kilometers on the southeastern flanks of the&#13;
Caucasus mountains. Over half of its 7.2 million population is urbanized; the capital, Baku, has&#13;
about 2 million inhabitants and is a major harbor on the Caspian Sea. The country is endowed with&#13;
fertile agricultural land and natural resources, including petroleum. Azerbaijan has been one of the&#13;
oldest oil producing regions in the world. Oil production has been declining, however, because&#13;
existing fields have reached a state of advanced depletion. The energy sector now accounts for less&#13;
than 20 percent of the Net Material Product (NMP). Azerbaijan has also a diversified industrial&#13;
structure and a relatively well educated labor force.           1&#13;
2.           Notwithstanding its political independence in August 1991, Azerbaijan has continued&#13;
to be an integral part of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) economy. The country remained in the&#13;
ruble zone throughout 1992, and the deeply entrenched economic interdependence continued to be in&#13;
place. In addition to transitional difficulties, the unsettled situation in Nagorno-Karabakh and the&#13;
continuous conflict with Armenia contributed to a drastic output decline. The large number of&#13;
refugees (about one million) and the occupation of territories by Armenian forces have been a major&#13;
factor of political instability within the country. As a result, the country underwent frequent&#13;
governmental changes. These unfavorable developments have diverted the Government of&#13;
Azerbaijan's (GOA) attention from economic reform issues.&#13;
3.           In 1992, the Government initiated some reform measures to liberalize the economy.&#13;
For this purpose, the Government took an early decision to introduce the national currency, the&#13;
manat, liberalized most prices, initiated financial sector reforms, and began developing the necessary&#13;
legal and institutional framework. These measures were not conceived as part of a comprehensive&#13;
reform program, and progress with privatization, enterprise restructuring, and land reform was&#13;
limited. However, the recent cease-fire and the improved prospects for peace have strengthened the&#13;
Government's determination to accelerate comprehensive reforms. Azerbaijan has also a buoyant and&#13;
rapidly expanding private sector.&#13;
A.    Policy Priorities During the Transition&#13;
4.           The major task confronting the Government in the immediate future is to stabilize the&#13;
economy and to undertake a comprehensive program of structural reforms to create the conditions for&#13;
sustainable growth. On the stabilization front, the authorities reached understandings with the&#13;
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a program which is being supported under the IMF's Systemic&#13;
Transformation Facility (STF). The main elements of the program are: (a) the unification of the&#13;
exchange rate; (b) a fiscal adjustment halving the budget deficit in 1995; and (c) a monetary program&#13;
compatible with these fiscal objectives.&#13;
5.           The Government has moved quickly in January/February 1995 to strengthen macro-&#13;
economic management and to stabilize the economy. As a result of the understandings reached with&#13;
the IMF on an STF program, it aims to reduce the monthly rate of inflation to 5 percent by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
middle of the year, and to 2 percent by the end of 1995, compared with an average increase of&#13;
29 percent in 1994.&#13;
B.    Structural Reform Program&#13;
6.            Price Liberalization: The Government has also begun to take measures to accelerate&#13;
structural reforms. It has liberalized all prices including bread, other than energy. Prices of oil and&#13;
oil products were raised to 66 percent of world levels in April 1995 and are to be raised further in&#13;
June 1995 to 100 percent of border prices. Price regulation will be limited to natural monopolies&#13;
(electricity, gas, district heating, water, sewage, rents and transport).&#13;
7.            Trade Liberalization: The system of domestic trade has been liberalized through the&#13;
abolition of state orders on January 1, 1995. The procurement related to the Government's own&#13;
needs is to be carried out at market prices. It has unified the exchange rate and eliminated the&#13;
implicit taxation of strategic exports resulting from the differentiated surrender requirements at below&#13;
market rates. It removed at the end of March 1995 all quotas and licensing requirements for imports&#13;
and exports except for energy products. The export of energy products will be subject to licensing&#13;
until July 1995, when it is expected to be abolished. The state dominance in foreign trade will be&#13;
significantly reduced, including elimination of government imports of grain. This should help the&#13;
private sector to play a vital role in foreign trade.&#13;
8.            Privatization: The Government has decided to speed up the privatization of&#13;
enterprises. Although the Government adopted a law on privatization in 1993, no program was&#13;
adopted to implement the law.&#13;
9.            Recognizing the importance of having an appropriate institutional framework to&#13;
implement a comprehensive privatization program, the Government decided to strengthen the State&#13;
Property Committee (SPC) and appointed a deputy prime minister responsible for the program. The&#13;
Government has prepared a comprehensive new privatization program, which has been discussed with&#13;
the Association. It is expected to be submitted to Parliament for approval soon. While the details of&#13;
its implementation are still being worked out, the proposal under consideration is ambitious covering&#13;
almost all small enterprises and most large and medium enterprises. It would result in the&#13;
privatization of approximately two-thirds of state assets in the productive sector in the first stage of&#13;
the program (1995-1998).&#13;
10.          Enterprise Reform: The Government is aware that without a strict financial discipline&#13;
on the enterprise sector, the stabilization program will not be sustainable. It recognizes the need to&#13;
strengthen corporate governance and enforce financial discipline, through restricting credit, and&#13;
making it available on market terms and only to those enterprises that have viable restructuring plans.&#13;
To enforce financial discipline on enterprises, the Government has decided to eliminate budgetary&#13;
support to enterprises, to refrain from directing credits to enterprises, and to encourage banks to force&#13;
borrowers to adhere to strict financial conditions. It also intends to enforce vigorously the recently&#13;
approved bankruptcy law.&#13;
11.          Private Sector Development:  Private sector development is an integral part of the&#13;
Government's economic transformation strategy. Given the inefficiencies and precarious financial&#13;
situation in the state-owned enterprises, the rapid development of the private sector is essential for&#13;
arresting the sharp decline in the economy and for the resumption of economic growth. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
development of the private sector will also help absorb the redundant labor currently employed in the&#13;
state-owned sector, which is likely to increase significantly with privatization and enterprise&#13;
restructuring, thus softening the impact of the transition on the population. In addition, a well-&#13;
functioning private sector will create the much needed competition to the state-owned sector.&#13;
12.          The Government realizes that the private sector in Azerbaijan has developed slowly,&#13;
partly as a result of the general political and economic difficulties in the country, but more&#13;
importantly because of the slow pace of privatization, the unequal access to credit and real estate for&#13;
private enterprises and the lack of a conducive legal and regulatory framework. In order to actively&#13;
promote private sector development, the Government has already taken a number of initial measures.&#13;
To increase the resources available to private enterprises, the National Bank of Azerbaijan (NBA)&#13;
recently raised its refinancing for private commercial banks from zero to 25 percent of total&#13;
refinancing for the banking system. It is the NBA's intention to further reduce its refinancing for the&#13;
state-owned commercial banks, which lend primarily to state-owned enterprises and to provide equal&#13;
access to its refinancing facility for the private commercial banks, which lends to private enterprises.&#13;
To create a level playing field for the private commercial banks, State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) will&#13;
be permitted to keep their deposits and to conduct other banking business with whatever bank the&#13;
enterprise chooses. Tax exemptions granted to the state-owned Amanat Bank, which provides unfair&#13;
competition to the private commercial banks, will be eliminated as soon as feasible.&#13;
13.          On the legal front, the Law on Collateral was adopted in 1994, and the Government&#13;
has submitted to the Parliament the Law on Mortgages. Until now, commercial real estate has been&#13;
very limited for the private sector, mainly because most commercial real estate has been in the hands&#13;
of state-owned enterprises. As indicated earlier, it is the Govermment's intention to privatize most&#13;
small enterprises as soon as possible and complete the small-scale privatization by the end of 1996.&#13;
During the privatization and corporatization process, state-owned enterprises will be encouraged to&#13;
spin off real estate and other assets and provisions will also be made for the sale of individual assets&#13;
of state-owned enterprises in the privatization program. The Government is currently drafting the&#13;
Law on Land Privatization and will submit it to the Parliament by June 30, 1995. New legislation&#13;
and amendments to existing legislation are to be introduced which will allow the free transfer and&#13;
mortgaging of residential and commercial real estate. The Government will set up a proper system of&#13;
titling, property registration and cadastre arrangements by the end of 1995.&#13;
14.          The Government recognizes that the current system of registration and regulation is&#13;
cumbersome and represents a serious obstacle to the rapid development of private enterprises. The&#13;
goal of the Government is to create a simplified and streamlined registration system for new&#13;
businesses and to establish a simple and transparent regulatory framework. To achieve this, the&#13;
Government will undertake a comprehensive review of the current regulatory framework for private&#13;
sector development. Based on the findings, a major deregulation initiative will be launched to remove&#13;
the barriers to entry and establish simple, open procedures for registration with a minimum of special&#13;
licensing. Legislation will also be introduced to establish effective and independent systems&#13;
(including voluntary arbitration) for the resolution of disputes, the enforcement of contracts and the&#13;
protection of legal rights. Some assistance has been provided by the European Union (EU) to match&#13;
the activities of Azeri and European enterprises.:&#13;
15.          In addition to price and trade liberalization (including the abolition of state orders) and&#13;
the measures to put the private sector on an equal footing with the SOEs, the Government has&#13;
indicated its intention to abolish the system of state supply of materials and equipment. Supply&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
offices will be privatized into a network of competing suppliers and purchasing enterprises will be&#13;
free to buy from any sources. The Government will include in the privatization program de-&#13;
monopolization measures which will ensure the breakup of monopolies, especially administrative&#13;
ones, in the course of corporatization and privatization. The administratively formed concerns and&#13;
associations will not be allowed to take part in the privatization of enterprises formerly under their&#13;
control. In the farm and agro-processing sector, the Government will actively promote competition&#13;
during the corporatization and privatization process, including discouraging the vertical integration&#13;
and cross-ownership of the farms and agro-processing enterprises.&#13;
16.          The creation of a competitive market environment is essential for the success of&#13;
enterprise reform and the development of the private sector. The emphasis of government&#13;
intervention will need to be changed significantly in the market environment.&#13;
17.          As a first step, the Government will introduce amendments to the existing anti-&#13;
monopoly legislation to abolish the 30 percent market share rule in defining monopolies and the&#13;
associated register of monopoly enterprises by June 30, 1995. In the coming year, the Government&#13;
will draft and submit to Parliament the Law on Natural Monopolies to provide a legal framework for&#13;
the regulation of public utilities and natural monopolies. Further legislation will be introduced on&#13;
mergers, acquisitions and holding companies.&#13;
18.          Legal Framework: Although Azerbaijan Republic has taken some steps and enacted&#13;
several laws to support a market economy, major gaps and inconsistencies pervade the legal&#13;
framework necessary for commercial activities to flourish. The lack of clear legal rules in many&#13;
critical areas has emerged as a major constraint to economic development in the newly independent&#13;
states of the FSU, including Azerbaijan. To encourage a sound environment for commercial activities&#13;
and development of the private sector, the authorities recognize it is crucial that the legal framework&#13;
provide clear and predictable rules concerning: (1) commercial law, including company law, contract&#13;
law, banking laws, and the related rules governing settlement of commercial disputes; (2) property&#13;
rights; (3) market entry and exit; and (4) trade and competition to inhibit monopolistic practices.&#13;
19.          Financial Sector Reform: The financial system in Azerbaijan consists of a central&#13;
bank, four large specialized state banks, a large number of commercial banks and insurance&#13;
companies. With a view to increasing competition, the banking law initially set a low level of capital&#13;
requirement for commercial banks. This resulted in a mushrooming of such banks, which used to be&#13;
largely owned by public enterprises, and which acted as conduits for channelling central bank&#13;
refinancing at negative real interest rates. The ownership structure of newly established commercial&#13;
banks has been diversified recently. The Government recognizes the important role the financial&#13;
sector will have to play both in the stabilization efforts and in private sector development, and it has&#13;
requested the IDA's assistance in developing a strategy for financial sector reform. That strategy&#13;
would include the establishment of accounting and auditing standards, prudential regulations,&#13;
strengthening the capacity of the Central Bank to supervise commercial banks and more importantly&#13;
restructuring and/or liquidation of some of the state banks.&#13;
20.           The NBA raised its refinancing rate to 17.5 percent per month on January 1, 1995,&#13;
and discontinued the automatic overdraft facility of the Agroprom Bank and Prominvest Bank, which&#13;
were the major sources of indiscriminate financing of enterprises. It introduced credit auctions and&#13;
plans to set its refinancing rates on the basis of the results of the auction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
21.           Social Protection: Azerbaijan inherited the Soviet system of social protection&#13;
concentrated on low administered prices for main household expenditure items, full employment, free&#13;
medical services, child allowances, and allowances for particular events (funerals, child birth,&#13;
maternity, sick leave and stay in sanatoria). The authorities recognize that the system is in many&#13;
ways incompatible with a market economy (reliance on price controls and full employment) and has&#13;
failed to prevent the appearance of poverty during the recession. Particularly the lack of targeting has&#13;
undermined the Government's ability to secure minimum benefit levels for those most at risk.&#13;
22.           Pending measures to improve the assessment of social safety net needs in Azerbaijan&#13;
including a well-defined minimum consumption basket and assessing informal sector incomes at the&#13;
household level, authorities have few choices but to limit social protection to easily identifiable&#13;
vulnerable groups such as non-working pensioners, families with two or more children, the&#13;
unemployed, and displaced persons.&#13;
23.          In the area of old age security, the Government is faced with the task of restoring&#13;
badly eroded income replacement levels for poor, non-working pensioners, but also to reduce payroll&#13;
taxes amounting to 35 percent for employers (25 percent in agriculture) plus 1 percent for workers.&#13;
Improvements are to be financed through increased collections and tighter benefit rules.&#13;
24.          In 1994, only 20 percent of the registered unemployed received unemployment&#13;
benefits. The average benefit amounted to only 13 percent of the average wage as benefits were fixed&#13;
on the basis of historical incomes and eroded quickly, this is being corrected. The central measure&#13;
intended on the benefit side is the adjustment of the minimum unemployment benefit to the level of&#13;
the minimum pension in the second half of 1995. This involves maintaining unemployment benefits&#13;
at 30 percent of the average wage. A particular concern relates to the possible strong increase in&#13;
long-term unemployment. The need for further measures will be studied, including possibilities for&#13;
social assistance or lengthening the period of eligibility for unemployment compensation beyond the&#13;
present 6 months.&#13;
25.           The Government has requested the Association to support its structural reform efforts&#13;
through a Rehabilitation Credit. This operation is under preparation. The Institution Building&#13;
Technical Assistance Project would assist the Government in the formulation and implementation of&#13;
reform measures in the areas to be supported by the proposed Rehabilitation Credit.&#13;
II. The Project&#13;
A.    Project Objectives&#13;
26.           The technical assistance to be provided under this Project will assist Azerbaijan to&#13;
design and implement reforms in key areas in its transition to a market-oriented economy. The main&#13;
objectives of the project are twofold: (a) in the short term, to support the Government in formulating&#13;
and elaborating reforms; and (b) in the medium term, to provide support for institutional building and&#13;
enhancing domestic capacity to ensure that Azerbaijan has the capability to implement and sustain&#13;
reforms. This project will thus contribute to increasing the momentum of overall reforrns.&#13;
&#13;

B.    Project Description&#13;
27.           The project consists of the following components: (i) assistance for privatization and&#13;
enterprise reform; (ii) strengthening macroeconomic management; (iii) financial sector development;&#13;
(iv) legal technical assistance; and, (v) project management. The project would provide advisory&#13;
services, training and equipment to the State Property Committee, the Ministry of Finance (MOF),&#13;
the State Tax Administration (STA), the NBA, and the Legal Department of the Parliament.&#13;
These components are elaborated below:&#13;
(i) Assistance for Privatization and Enterprise Reforms&#13;
28.           During the second half of 1992, the Government of Azerbaijan embarked on a reform&#13;
of SOE aimed at improving efficiency through the transfer of ownership to private parties and&#13;
improved governance. A SPC was established to undertake ownership transfer. In January 1993, a&#13;
privatization law authorized privatization of all state assets, excepting a negative list to be determined&#13;
in a program to be developed by the SPC and approved by Parliament. However, due in part to&#13;
difficult external factors, no comprehensive program to implement the law was adopted.&#13;
29.           The Government appointed a new Chairman of the State Property Committee with the&#13;
rank of Deputy Prime Minister in January 1995. The Government intends to proceed rapidly with the&#13;
privatization of over 70% of state enterprises (by asset value and employment). The objectives of&#13;
privatization are to increase efficiency in the production of goods and services through widespread&#13;
private ownership, entrepreneurial management and competition; to eliminate demands for budget&#13;
subsidies and directed credits which burden the state; and to distribute the national wealth fairly and&#13;
transparently. To accomplish these goals, the Government has adopted a comprehensive Privatization&#13;
Program and an Action Plan for implementation under the direction of the State Privatization&#13;
Committee (SPC). Priority in 1995 will be small scale privatization, corporatization, and completing&#13;
the legal, regulatory, administrative and physical infrastructure for mass privatization (auctions to&#13;
commence by early 1996) and the establishment of a share trading market.&#13;
30.           The Program covers virtually all small scale enterprises and most medium and large-&#13;
sized enterprises in all sectors of the economy, including communications, transport, power, and&#13;
agro-processing. Excluded from the privatization program are only the extraction of non-renewable&#13;
mineral resources, natural monopolies, cultural and historical legacy, Military and Navy forces,&#13;
environmental protection and social protection agencies. Small scale privatization will begin with the&#13;
privatization of over 8,000 objects in 1995 and the balance in 1996. Existing workers will have a&#13;
transferable right of first refusal to obtain ownership on favorable terms. Otherwise, small objects&#13;
will be auctioned publicly in corresponding localities through uniform and transparent procedures,&#13;
with information published in advance. There will be no profiles for privatized small enterprises&#13;
except for a few consumer necessities for retail shops (such as bread, pharmeucuticals), with all such&#13;
profiles to be terminated by 1998. There will be no profiles for enterprises in the mass privatization&#13;
program.&#13;
31.           All medium and large enterprises will be rapidly corporatized. Regulations for&#13;
corporatization, including model or standard packages of documents will be made available to all&#13;
enterprises by December 31, 1995. The package will include a simple, standard valuation&#13;
methodology, a model balance sheet, a corporate charter, minutes book, a prospectus (for open joint&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
stock companies), an application for registration and instructions for completion, including strict&#13;
deadlines to be enforced by the State Property Committee which will have the authority to take over&#13;
the process if the enterprise fails to meet the deadlines. The Action Plan for Privatization includes&#13;
the detailed time tables.&#13;
32.           A major feature of the Program is the rapid transfer of ownership of medium and&#13;
large enterprise through the use of "pai" (share). Each citizen of the Republic will receive one pai,&#13;
each with four vouchers. Vouchers can be used separately to acquire up to 65 % of the shares of all&#13;
enterprises subject to privatization which are not small scale or subject to commercial tender (or case&#13;
by case) privatization. Workers shall have a preferred right, in an initial closed subscription, to&#13;
receive up to 15% of an enterprise for their pai, with shares not taken by them made available for&#13;
auction to the public. At least 50% of shares will be auctioned to the public for vouchers. (Of the&#13;
remaining 35%, 10-20% will be sold at cash auctions and the balance will be distributed between&#13;
Government Reserve Investment Funds (GRIFs) and "Closed-end funds" (ZIFs). The auction&#13;
methodology will be transparent, fair and simple, with the objective of clearing the market at once.&#13;
Once a supply of corporatized enterprises is established, the auction process will be conducted in&#13;
"rounds" whereby a number is brought to market regularly. Unpriced bids will be presented by&#13;
voucher holders to local "share shops" which will send the bids to a central clearing facility for&#13;
calculation of results and notification and documentation of the new shareholder. The share shops&#13;
have no role in advising or directing voucher or share placement.&#13;
33.           The pai program will be supported by a central depository for safe keeping of shares&#13;
and destruction of vouchers ("checks") and for establishing a central account system for stock transfer&#13;
and the issue of account statements. A new Securities Commission will supervise the depository. A&#13;
private securities market will be encouraged through the licensing of private brokers. Secondary&#13;
trading and issue of shares will be on a private exchange. Regulations for the auction process, the&#13;
depository, the form of shares (whether certificated, dematerialized, bearer, registered, etc.) and the&#13;
trading of shares, share shops, and the technical means for support are expected to be issued by&#13;
September 30, 1995.&#13;
34.           For a few very large, significant enterprises, the Program provides for privatization&#13;
through commercial tender. This form of privatization is also referred to as case by case&#13;
privatization. This form of privatization will seek strategic investors, both foreign and local. Not&#13;
more than 10% of enterprises subject to privatization (by value and employment) will be subject to&#13;
case by case privatization. Regulations for commercial tender privatization and standard procedures&#13;
and model documents will be finalized by December 31, 1995.&#13;
35.           To encourage widespread investment and risk diversification, the Government will&#13;
encourage the emergence of private investment funds. Necessary regulations concerning investment&#13;
funds will be adopted by December 31, 1995. Investment funds will be in the form of joint stock&#13;
corporations and will be permitted to issue their own shares for vouchers. Their investment will be&#13;
limited to valuable papers (securities, bonds, cash). No investment fund will be able to acquire more&#13;
than 10% of all vouchers issued. At auctions, any one private investment fund will be able to acquire&#13;
up to 25% of the shares of any one enterprise.- Investment funds will not be permitted to invest more&#13;
than 15% of their assets in any one corporation. The regulations will prevent concentration of funds&#13;
under related owners or groups or holding companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36.          In addition, the Government intends to establish GRIFs and ZIFs. GRIFs are initially&#13;
state owned investment funds in the form of a joint stock company. The Government will place no&#13;
more than 15% of the shares of each medium and large enterprise in the privatization process into&#13;
GRIFs. All the shares of the GRIFs will be sold to the public and thus privatized. The regulations&#13;
on GRIFs and ZIFs will be adopted by December 31, 1995. (Initially established as state-owned&#13;
investment funds, ZIFs will receive not more than 10% of shares of the most liquid companies. ZIFs&#13;
shares will then be sold exclusively to foreign investors).&#13;
37.          The Government is opposed to monopolistic structures and will prevent their&#13;
emergence or continuation in the privatization process. Consequently, in the process of&#13;
corporatization, applications from enterprises with more then 500 employees or having a monopoly&#13;
position will be reviewed by the SPC and the Antimonopoly Committee and, according to criteria&#13;
included in the Program, such enterprises may be divided prior to privatization. Holding companies&#13;
will be limited to a very few, in specific industries or utilities where economies of scale are required&#13;
to permit competition outside the Republic or efficiency of services to the public. However, even for&#13;
such structures, enterprises or activities not directly related to the main business, such as catering or&#13;
supply of materials, will be separated and privatized. Holding companies are absolutely prohibited in&#13;
the ares of trade, catering, consumer services, material supply, wholesale trade, local and light&#13;
industry, distribution, food processing, road transport, and construction.&#13;
38.          As public information is vital to the success of privatization, the Government will&#13;
undertake an active effort to keep the public fully informed about all aspects of the privatization.&#13;
39.          The Government recognizes it is essential that privatized/private enterprises begin&#13;
their functioning on the principles of market economy. It will take steps to impose a "hard budget&#13;
constraint" on financing of their activities, and state subsidies will be eliminated and prohibited in the&#13;
future for these enterprises in order to enforce financial discipline and facilitate their successful&#13;
transition to the market economy.&#13;
40.           International Donors. The EU's Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of&#13;
Independent States (TACIS) program has placed a team of long- term advisers with the SPC in Baku.&#13;
These advisers, to be supplemented with teams of short-term consultants, are focused on assisting the&#13;
SPC with its current priorities, primarily the design of a comprehensive plan and strategy and, where&#13;
feasible, commencement of implementation. The TACIS team will also work to strengthen the&#13;
institutional capacity of the SPC for the management of privatization policy and the development of a&#13;
training and information campaign. The current EU program is funded at 1.5 million European&#13;
Currency Unit (ECU). A second EU program has recently begun and is focused on sector and&#13;
enterprise specific work. The core of this 1995 TACIS project is the creation of a Management&#13;
Advice and Services Facility (MASF) to work with specific enterprises to design appropriate&#13;
restructuring/privatization plans for 6-8 large enterprises. The funding level for this second TACIS&#13;
project is estimated at 1.2 million ECU. However, the resources from TACIS are inadequate to&#13;
implement the accelerated program currently under consideration.&#13;
41.           Objectives of the Proposed Technical Assistance. The proposed IDA assistance for&#13;
Privatization and Enterprise Reform includes three components: (1) Privatization; (2) Public&#13;
Education and Information for Privatization and Enterprise Reform; and (3) Corporatization and&#13;
Capital Market Development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
(1)    Privatization. This sub-component has the following main objectives:&#13;
i.     Mass Privatization. Assistance to the SPC in completion (as may be&#13;
necessary) of the design and implementation of a mass privatization program&#13;
for a significant number of medium and large enterprises;&#13;
ii.    Case by Case Privatization. Assistance to the SPC to establish a policy&#13;
framework with options, and a capacity for carrying out and supervising case-&#13;
by-case privatization transactions for very large, "special" enterprises;&#13;
iii.    Corporatization. Assistance to the SPC, in the context of preparing the&#13;
privatization program, to assist, as necessary, in implementation of the&#13;
corporatization program, including drafting of tools (documents, procedures,&#13;
law) and establishment of appropriate registries incident to the corporatization&#13;
of medium and large enterprises; and&#13;
iv.    Training. Assistance to the SPC in training SPC staff, including working&#13;
visits (about ten staff) to privatization agencies in other countries and&#13;
comparative consideration of privatization programs.&#13;
42.           The assistance, covering about 150 person-months of advisory services, will extend&#13;
over a 18 month period starting approximately in early October 1995. The contract for the Project&#13;
(excluding the provision of equipment) will be awarded to one general contractor (the "Consultant").&#13;
The Consultant will be encouraged to subcontract components (or parts thereof) to other consultants&#13;
where specific skills are needed.&#13;
43.           The Consultant for this Project will coordinate closely with other consultants that&#13;
support enterprise sector reforms, particularly the team provided by EU-TACIS. The volume of EU&#13;
assistance is insufficient to cover every aspect of privatization and the technical assistance provided by&#13;
the Associations seeks, to reduce overlap between the two assistance groups, emphasizing assistance&#13;
to complement the EU assistance in specific areas. Close coordination between the two groups in&#13;
head offices and particularly in the field shall aim at distributing tasks and ensuring the efficiency of&#13;
the assistance provided. Ensuring such coordination would be SPC's responsibility.&#13;
44.           Training will form an important element of each component, and will include formal&#13;
training events such as workshops, on-site presentations, development of manuals and demonstrations&#13;
of use of equipment and techniques. Comparative lessons from other countries to be provided.&#13;
(2)    Public Education and Information for Privatization and Enterprise Reform.&#13;
45.           Evidence from privatization programs in many states suggests that privatization&#13;
programs are unlikely to succeed without strong support from the general public. Public education&#13;
programs are core elements of the privatization program. In Azerbaijan, the idea of widespread&#13;
privatization will have to be carefully explained to the public in order to gain support and&#13;
participation. This support can be gained only through the means of a modern, public education and&#13;
information campaign, utilizing in the most advanced way, all forms of media. In addition, the form&#13;
of media and the style of message must suit the Azeri people and also be sensitive to local traditions,&#13;
customs and concerns, in the Republic and in each particular district as well. The objectives of this&#13;
component are the development and implementation of a comprehensive program to inform the&#13;
public about privatization, the Government's privatization program and about specific elements of that&#13;
program such as auctions, investment funds, individual cases, etc. These objectives include training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
both SPC and Governmental staff as well as media employees in techniques of promotion and to assist&#13;
public relations initiatives aimed at the development of privately owned public relations firms.&#13;
46.           The successful consultants will work directly under the Chairman of the State&#13;
Property Committee (SPC). The assignment, encompassing about 65 person-months, will be for a&#13;
period of 12 months, with the possibility of extension on a mutually acceptable basis.&#13;
47.           The assignment consists of: (a) development and implementation of a communications&#13;
strategy; (b) design, production and dissemination of advertising and related materials; and (c) special&#13;
events.&#13;
a.     Development and implementation of a communications strategv. The consultants will&#13;
be required to develop and implement -in conjunction with local counterparts a&#13;
comprehensive communications strategy for all elements of the Government's reform&#13;
program, consisting of sectoral, national and international campaigns. The sectoral&#13;
campaign- targeted specifically at legislators, ministers, and enterprise managers and&#13;
employees- is aimed at building support for the reform program among these key&#13;
groups. The national campaign should serve to educate the public at large about the&#13;
benefits of reform and aim to build support among different groups such as trade&#13;
unions, entrepreneurs, workers, social service providers and the general public. The&#13;
international campaign is aimed at marketing abroad those enterprises selected for&#13;
tender sale and for which the SPC considers the possibility of foreign interest;&#13;
b.     Design, production and dissemination of advertising and related materials. The&#13;
strategy should define specific outputs and a proposed schedule for these outputs. It is&#13;
anticipated that the major outputs would include:&#13;
*     Television and radio advertising;&#13;
*      Print advertising (domestic and international);&#13;
*      Qualitative research packages (focus group results);&#13;
*      Quantitative public opinion surveys;&#13;
*      Direct mail to targeted groups;&#13;
*      Seminars, exhibits and educational events.&#13;
c.     Special Events. The consultants will also be responsible for organizing special events,&#13;
such as seminars and training programs for key public officials, managers, investment&#13;
funds and others to inform them about the overall program.&#13;
(3)    Corporatization and Capital Markets Development.&#13;
48.           This component has three main objectives:&#13;
a.     Corporatization. Assistance to the SPC\MOF in implementation of the corporatization&#13;
program, including drafting of tools (documents, procedures, law) and establishment&#13;
of appropriate registries incident to the corporatization of medium and large&#13;
enterprises;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
b.     Assessment of Current Basis for Establishing Capital Markets. Assistance to the&#13;
SPC\MOF, to establish a policy framework with options, legislative and regulatory&#13;
recommendations for establishing capital markets that would support the privatization&#13;
and enterprise reform program and post-privatization financing; and&#13;
c.     Training. Assistance to the MOF in training staff.&#13;
49.           The assistance, covering about 35 man-months of advisory services, will extend over&#13;
a 12 month period starting approximately in early August 1995. The contract for the Project&#13;
(excluding the provision of equipment) will be awarded to one general contractor (the "Consultant").&#13;
The Consultant is encouraged to subcontract components (or parts thereof) to other consultants where&#13;
specific skills are needed. The Project is divided into three main components as described below.&#13;
Component (A):        Corporatization&#13;
The long resident consultant will focus on the corporatization process to assure its&#13;
speedy and efficient completion, working with the SPC and its privatization&#13;
consultants as to provide an ample supply of tradeable shares for the mass&#13;
privatization program. In this respect, for corporatization issues, the Consultant will&#13;
also make available, on short term notice for short term assignment, such staff as&#13;
necessary to assist in the process and development of necessary institutions such as&#13;
registries.&#13;
The key issues to be addressed for a corporatization program include:&#13;
*      advice on policy and implementation of speedy corporatization programs,&#13;
including consideration of various models in different countries;&#13;
*      defining the objectives, objects and subjects of a program. The number, size&#13;
and characteristics of the enterprises are to be considered as well as the&#13;
treatment of interested parties such as management, labor, and the general&#13;
population;&#13;
*      determining the policy and implementation for treatment of land under&#13;
enterprises, social assets and liabilities, including debt and environmental&#13;
liability;&#13;
*      determining the mechanics and conditions of capitalization;&#13;
*      consideration of the incorporation of investment funds, including their&#13;
establishment, regulation, and training needs;&#13;
*      preparation of enterprises, through corporatization, for mass privatization,&#13;
including legal and documentary requirements, the timing and sequence of the&#13;
incorporation of enterprises and the methods of determining governance and&#13;
capital structure;&#13;
*      determination of criteria, timing and sequence of actions and related&#13;
institutional needs for the program; and&#13;
*      identification and recommendations for legal and administrative measures,&#13;
procedures and documents necessary to facilitate the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Component (B):        Capital Markets&#13;
It is expected the Consultants will focus on the requisites for establishing the legal,&#13;
regulatory and institutional framework for a functioning capital market. The&#13;
Consultant will provide one long-term resident staff person for capital markets,&#13;
assisted, as appropriate, by short-term consultants as proposed in the Consultant Work&#13;
Plan. This component has five sub-components as follows:&#13;
*      Assessment of Currently Existing Capital Markets. Consultants will give a&#13;
factual description of the state of currently existing capital markets. The&#13;
assessment should include a description of all financial instruments used in the&#13;
capital markets, the extent to which such instruments are purchased and&#13;
traded, and the institutions involved in the capital market. The assessment&#13;
should also include a brief review of the existing regulatory framework&#13;
applicable to capital markets transactions.&#13;
*      Analysis of the Barriers to, and Potential for. Development of Capital&#13;
Markets. The Consultants will analyze the factors currently existing in&#13;
Azerbaijan that prevent or hinder the development of active capital markets, as&#13;
well as the measures required to remove such barriers and to establish the pre-&#13;
requisites required for a functioning and active capital markets.&#13;
*      Strategy. The Consultants should describe a strategy to develop active capital&#13;
markets. Included in the strategy should be a description of basic "guiding&#13;
principles" or objectives to be achieved in the long-term. A menu of options,&#13;
including necessary implementing legislation and institutional arrangements&#13;
shall be provided.&#13;
*      Assistance. The Consultants should prepare a technical assistance plan of&#13;
action describing the steps to be taken and the assistance required to establish&#13;
prerequisites for the development of capital markets and to promote further&#13;
growth of such markets in Azerbaijan. The plan of action should be set out in&#13;
stages. The Consultants should also describe necessary conditions which&#13;
should be fulfilled before proceeding to the next stage of technical assistance.&#13;
Consideration of the role of capital markets in supporting the privatization&#13;
program and post-privatization financing will also be included. The&#13;
consultants will provide model drafts, including documents, regulations and&#13;
rules. Various models and options will be proposed for trading, clearing,&#13;
settlement and supervision of the market and market participants. The&#13;
Consultants will work with the MOF in designing and implementing capital&#13;
markets infrastructure and start-up.&#13;
*      Time/Action Matrix. The Consultants should prepare a matrix of the actions&#13;
required to accomplish the prerequisites for the establishment of capital&#13;
markets and for the further growth of capital markets. The matrix should give&#13;
priority and timing to the carrying out of actions required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Component (C): Training&#13;
Training will form an important element of each component, and will include formal&#13;
training events such as workshops, on-site presentations, development of manuals and&#13;
demonstrations of use of equipment and techniques. Comparative lessons from other&#13;
countries are to be provided. The Consultant will provide "hands-on" training&#13;
throughout the term of the contract including short, informal seminars, development&#13;
of case studies, models, manuals and standardized documents.&#13;
50.          The project includes assistance in the printing and distribution of privatization&#13;
vouchers.&#13;
(ii)   Strengthening Macroeconomic Management&#13;
Strengthening Budget Formulation, Implementation and Monitoring.&#13;
51.          The system of budget formulation and implementation, as inherited from the FSU,&#13;
was designed for a completely different environment and to perform rather limited functions. As the&#13;
country moves towards a market-based system, the role of the budget as one of the main tools of&#13;
macro-economic and financial management will be significant.&#13;
52.          In the present unstable macro-economic environment, characterized by crisis, inflation&#13;
and a high degree of uncertainty, the system of financial management in place is not flexible enough&#13;
to respond quickly to problems as they develop. The weaknesses arise from: (a) a limited accounting&#13;
and reporting system - the system does not generate a fast enough flow of information to the MOF to&#13;
allow the budget to be monitored, controlled and revised in a timely manner, and consequently cannot&#13;
form the basis for timely fiscal adjustment; (b) the budget formulation and execution is not being&#13;
carried out within the context of a macro-economic framework to ensure adequate coordination with&#13;
monetary and external policies; and (c) financial operations such as cash, debt and asset management&#13;
are largely absent. The scope for financing the Government's deficit is limited by an undeveloped&#13;
market for government debt, which is constrained by a lack of domestic savings and also by a number&#13;
of institutional and technical factors.&#13;
53.          While the development of an efficient fiscal management system and preparing the&#13;
MOF to function in a market-based economy is necessarily a medium-term objective, changes are&#13;
needed in the present system of budget execution to cope with severe budget pressures and control the&#13;
budget deficit, which is an immediate imperative.&#13;
54.          As a part of the stabilization program agreed with the IMF, all budget accounts of the&#13;
Republican Government have been centralized at the NBA. Steps are being taken to integrate all&#13;
extrabudgetary funds into the State budget for 1996. The Social Protection Fund and the Employment&#13;
Fund have been required to submit monthly financial statements to the MOF, and the extrabudgetary&#13;
funds and the local governments will not be allowed to borrow from the banking system without prior&#13;
permission from the MOF.&#13;
55.          The Government's 1995 budget envisages substantial cuts in expenditures. There&#13;
exists a risk that major imbalances would emerge from time to time. To ensure compliance with the&#13;
agreed fiscal targets, the Government has introduced a "cash rationing system" for expenditures,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
which entails a strict prioritization of expenditure categories. Non-priority expenditures will be&#13;
funded only to the extent the targeted domestic financing of the budget will not be exceeded.&#13;
56.          The International Monetary Fund is providing technical assistance to Azerbaijan in&#13;
identifying both short-term and medium measures to strengthen fiscal management, and to establish a&#13;
Treasury. The principal limitation on the MOF's ability to adequately respond to economic&#13;
developments and effectively control the Government's deficit is the lack of relevant information on a&#13;
timely basis. The proposed technical assistance would provide equipment and training for&#13;
computerization of the MOF's information system, and help improve budgetary and debt&#13;
management. The training program will be designed in consultation with the IMF's advisor on&#13;
treasury operations.&#13;
Strengthening Tax Administration.&#13;
57.          As in other republics of the FSU, Azerbaijan had also introduced in 1992 tax reform&#13;
and enacted new tax measures such as the value added tax, the personal income tax and the corporate&#13;
profits tax. Tax administration in Azerbaijan is facing numerous critical problems, which are&#13;
aggravated by policies and procedures based on the old centrally planned system of accounting.&#13;
Moreover, the liberalization of prices and the relative price changes, followed by high inflation in the&#13;
economy, have also added to the challenges of efficient tax administration.&#13;
58.          From September 1994, Azerbaijan has begun applying Value Added Tax to imports,&#13;
except those exempted by the Government (primarily foodstuffs and industrial raw materials).&#13;
59.          With high inflation, the real value of tax liability is eroded. Besides, the current&#13;
system does not carture the growing activities of private entrepreneurs. Currently, only a very small&#13;
number of self-employed persons pay income tax and a large number pay a fee for a license to&#13;
operate a business, until their income exceeds the upper limit of the lowest income tax bracket.&#13;
60.          The organizational structure of the STA, originally organized partially by type of tax,&#13;
partially by type of taxpayer, and partially by function, was significantly changed in 1994. Besides&#13;
having responsibility for the development of policy and procedures, the State Tax Inspectorate&#13;
oversees 84 district tax inspectorate, 64 directly and 20 through regional inspectorate.&#13;
61.           The modernization of the tax administration involves new systems and procedures&#13;
and computerization. The International Monetary Fund has provided technical assistance in&#13;
improving the policies and procedures. Almost all procedures are currently manual. The proposed&#13;
project would assist in the development of a long-term computerization plan and the provision of&#13;
computer equipment for interim computerization of the system, which would facilitate timely&#13;
assessment and collection of tax revenues. The technical assistance proposed includes provision of&#13;
consultant services and equipment such as hardware, software, links to the existing communications&#13;
systems and through them to the MOF and the NBA. As a Resident Advisor provided by the Fund is&#13;
now in place, the IMF has suggested that the consultant services should be oriented towards&#13;
strengthening tax audit functions in the STA, after the first phase of IMF's assistance has been&#13;
completed.&#13;
(iii) Financial Sector Development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
62.          The financial sector of Azerbaijan is in its early stages of development. The legal&#13;
framework for a two-tier banking system in Azerbaijan was established in 1992. The NBA has since&#13;
made significant progress toward functioning as a modern Central Bank. The Government&#13;
recognizes that development of a healthy financial sector should be accelerated to assist the emerging&#13;
private sector and support the privatization and restructuring of state enterprises.&#13;
63.          In addition to the NBA as a Central Bank, Azerbaijan has four specialized state-owned&#13;
banks and about 200 new commercial banks. Although the number of commercial banks has been&#13;
increasing rapidly, the banking system is highly concentrated in the four state banks which control&#13;
more than 50 percent of total credits in the country. Two of the state banks, the Agroprombank&#13;
(Agro-industrial Bank) and the Prominvestbank (Industrial Investment Bank), are sectoral lending&#13;
banks. They have been converted to joint-stock commercial banks with ownership shared by the&#13;
government (as a majority owner), state-owned enterprises and private entities. There is a specialized&#13;
state-owned Savings Bank which is locally called Amanatbank for household deposits. The&#13;
International Bank was established as a joint-stock commercial bank, having been transformed from&#13;
the local branch of the Soviet Vneshekonombank (Foreign Exchange Bank) to handle foreign&#13;
exchange operations and the international finance activities. Although it was initially given a near&#13;
monopoly in foreign exchange operations, it faces increasing competition with some 100 newly-&#13;
established commercial banks authorized to transact in foreign currency.&#13;
64.          A lack of modern accounting and auditing standards makes the financial status of the&#13;
commercial banks unclear. The new commercial banks have tried to diversify their ownership&#13;
structures. Many of these banks were originally established by state enterprises mainly to get&#13;
financial resources from the NBA, the Savings Bank, and the interbank market and to provide&#13;
financing to the enterprises that own them. State enterprises later withdrew from ownership, partly&#13;
because of the private banks' restricted access to refinance credit; as a result these banks have become&#13;
largely privately owned. Private banks provide trade financing to the emerging private sector, but are&#13;
too small and fragmented to supply the financial services and credit that enterprises will need soon&#13;
after privatization. At present they are providing more than 30 percent of total credits to enterprises&#13;
and individuals. The Government recognizes the need for fostering consolidation in the private&#13;
banking system and has been increasing the minimum capital requirements to encourage such&#13;
consolidation.&#13;
65.          The Government has begun to take a number of steps to restructure the financial&#13;
sector. With the passage of the Law on Banks and Banking Activity and the Law on the National&#13;
Bank in August 1992, Azerbaijan has made progress toward establishing a legal framework for a&#13;
modern banking system. The Law on the National Bank gave the NBA the authority of a Central&#13;
Bank in the new financial system. Under this law, three regulations, adopted by the NBA, which&#13;
include: (a) requirements for bank licensing; (b) prudential rules for domestic banking operations;&#13;
and (c) licensing requirements and limits on foreign exchange operations, took effect in October 1992.&#13;
The NBA has been tightening these bank licensing requirements and various prudential ratios for&#13;
banks by stages. The NBA, which is in the process of adjusting to its new role under the new&#13;
economic system, has been receiving technical assistance in that effort mainly from the IMF. The&#13;
Law on Banks and Banking Activity, which stipulates the basis of activities of all the commercial&#13;
banks including the state banks, allows them to set interest rates of credits and deposits and other&#13;
internal management policy. This law, however, is in the early stages of implementation and has to&#13;
be improved to build a modern commercial banking system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
66.           The NBA has taken wide-ranging steps to deepen banking reforms and to level the&#13;
playing field for private and state banks. In 1994, the system which allowed state-owned banks to&#13;
have automatic access to refinancing facilities of the National Bank was abolished. The reserve&#13;
requirements for all banks have been unified in March at 12 percent. The government has also&#13;
initiated credit auctions. As a temporary measure to prevent domination of the credit auctions by&#13;
state banks, separate refinance credit limits have been set for Prominvest and Agroprom, with the cost&#13;
of refinancing credits to the state banks being based upon the rates determined in the auction market.&#13;
Initially 25 percent of the total refinance credit allowable under the monetary program is being&#13;
auctioned to the participating private banks.&#13;
67.           The National Bank recognizes the need to improve its supervision of banks in the area&#13;
of asset classification and provisioning for bad and doubtful debt. It plans to issue rules requiring all&#13;
state and private banks to introduce asset classification procedures and make provisions based on this&#13;
classification.&#13;
68.           The financial sector components of this institution building technical assistance project&#13;
will focus mainly on building the infrastructure and skills necessary for the functioning of a modem&#13;
banking system, complementing the IMF's assistance for the NBA. The objectives of the proposed&#13;
technical assistance are: (i) to strengthen the payments system; (ii) to develop accounting and&#13;
auditing systems and standards for enterprises and banks; (iii) to strengthen prudential regulations,&#13;
and the bank supervision function of the NBA, and to help review the situation in the existing large&#13;
state banks and develop options on dealing with their problem portfolio; and (iv) to develop basic&#13;
banking skills of core central and commercial bank staff.&#13;
69.           Payments System: The present system of settling intra-republican payments results in&#13;
delays, making liquidity management difficult for the banks and the enterprises. The two large&#13;
sectoral banks followed the old FSU payment order settlement system where the interbranch and&#13;
interbank settlements were carried out only at the end of the year. The NBA has initiated steps to&#13;
establish a more efficient payment and clearing system, under which the state banks will also open&#13;
correspondent clearing accounts with the NBA. To develop an efficient clearing system, the National&#13;
Bank will be provided with hardware, software and telecommunications support, as well as training.&#13;
The technical assistance also includes studies for a second stage development of the payments system,&#13;
and identifying the needs for modern equipment and software when the telecommunications&#13;
development progresses in the country. The consultant will:&#13;
a.     undertake a feasibility study on the implementation of a country-wide banking data&#13;
network, to be used for electronic transmission of all the inter-bank payments&#13;
transactions of the national payments system;&#13;
b.    identify the most cost-effective ways of transmitting data electronically between&#13;
commercial banks branches\head office and the settlement centers of the National&#13;
bank, taking into account the present and future telecommunication development&#13;
plans, as come up with feasible telecommunication solutions;&#13;
c.     propose specific hardware\software solutions; and&#13;
d.     describe in detail both the computer and telecom equipment, data transmission&#13;
software (including data security encryption, recovery mechanisms etc).&#13;
70.           Prudential Bank Supervision and Studies of Selected Commercial Banks: The IMF&#13;
has already been providing assistance mainly to develop prudential regulations and off-site supervision&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
capacity of the NBA, which includes upgrading skills of supervisors and reporting systems of banks&#13;
to the NBA, and other policy advice. However, there is also a need to develop the NBA's on-site&#13;
supervision capability, which includes on-the-job training for bank examiners, preparation of bank&#13;
examination guidelines, and other policy advice as well as training. The proposed assistance will&#13;
complement the IMF's assistance and will provide equipment, software, and basic staff training on a&#13;
classroom basis, on-the-job basis, and through study tours to developed countries.&#13;
71.           The Consultant(s) will, working closely with the Advisor provided by the IMF:&#13;
a.     advise on the organizational structure of the Department of Banking Inspection and the&#13;
Department of Regulation of Banking Activities for efficient conduct of prudential&#13;
bank supervision activities, and help establish an organizational and human resources&#13;
development plan;&#13;
b.     help review and define the responsibilities and collaboration between the republican&#13;
and territorial branches of NBA in the field of bank supervision;&#13;
c.     advise on matters of Bank supervision policy;&#13;
d.    review existing legislation and regulations and other normative documents closely&#13;
related to prudential bank supervision and propose modifications, taking into account&#13;
international experience, and make recommendations for their improvement and&#13;
conforming to international norms; work closely with the legal technical assistance&#13;
team as it relates to banking and bank supervision;&#13;
e.     help the NBA in establishing loan classification standards for the commercial banks,&#13;
based on international norms, familiarize the NBA policy-makers and staff with&#13;
internationally accepted loan classification standards; and develop instructions for the&#13;
application of these standards. In this matter, the Consultant will also coordinate&#13;
closely with consultant teams in charge of the diagnostic studies of the savings,&#13;
agricultural, and industrial banks in Azerbaijan; and bank accounting and audit;&#13;
f.     help the NBA develop a system for off-site bank supervision, including reporting&#13;
requirements, and prepare an instructions manual covering all these issues, and train&#13;
the NBA staff in the use of the new off-site supervision system;&#13;
g.    lead at least two teams, each of which will consist of 8-10 local bank supervisors in&#13;
the partial on-site supervision of three banks, respectively. Given the pilot nature, it is&#13;
suggested that some smaller commercial banks other than the state specialized banks&#13;
should be examined;&#13;
h.     provide classroom training for bank supervision staff of the NBA. In the first six&#13;
months of the assignment, he or she should provide a total of at least four weeks of&#13;
such training. The extent of such training in the later months of the assignment period&#13;
will depend on the mobilization of additional donor-funded trainers. The initial&#13;
training could cover some fundamentals in finance and banking, basics of banking&#13;
supervision, an introduction to ratio analysis, etc.; an outline of the training topics&#13;
should be proposed in the Consultant's Inception Report;&#13;
i.    help the NBA identify and arrange overseas training for five bank supervision staff&#13;
(seminars, secondments, conference participation, etc.); and,&#13;
give brief workshops or presentations on issues of bank supervision for senior NBA&#13;
staff, other relevant policy-makers, and bank managers. Moreover, the Consultant is&#13;
encouraged to flexibly arrange short informal discussions with counterpart officials&#13;
and staff for training purposes on an ad hoc basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
72.           The NBA and the Government face difficult strategic policy questions on the&#13;
framework for the financial sector during the transition from a planned to a market economy. One&#13;
area of immediate concern is the policy toward the largest and the most influential conmmercial banks,&#13;
in particular, the four state banks, which inherited unreconciled accounts, weak credit portfolios, and&#13;
operating procedures designed for a central allocation system. In order to redress this situation and&#13;
before rehabilitating any of these banks, the Government will need information on the implications&#13;
and costs of the various options for restructuring them. While the Government and the National Bank&#13;
have taken steps to promote a level playing field for the private sector banks, and to ensure an&#13;
increasing proportion of the NBA's refinancing to the private sector, and the share of state banks in&#13;
the total credits has declined significantly, the future development of the banking sector will have to&#13;
address the role of large majority state-owned commercial banks and means of dealing with their&#13;
portfolios. The studies of the financial health of selected commercial banks will be undertaken to&#13;
assess the health of the banks' portfolios, and the implications and costs of various options for&#13;
addressing their financial condition, and their potential role, in a competitive environment, for&#13;
provision of credit, especially for agriculture in the context of farm privatization. The studies will be&#13;
a major initial step to set up financial sector strategies and help strengthen the on-site bank&#13;
supervision function of the NBA.&#13;
73.           Accounting and Auditing Reform: Significant work has been done for the FSU,&#13;
especially Russia, to develop accounting and auditing standards in harmony with internationally&#13;
accepted standards. A new accounting law has passed the Parliament, seeking to modernize&#13;
accounting standards. However, the Government and the NBA face difficulties in adopting and&#13;
implementing internationally accepted accounting standards. The proposed program would assist&#13;
enterprises and commercial banks in adopting accounting and auditing principles developed for the&#13;
FSU countries under the leadership of the MOF and the NBA, and then the program would assist the&#13;
MOF and the NBA in developing internationally accepted accounting and auditing standards.&#13;
Resident advisors will be placed in the MOF and the NBA respectively for this purpose. The&#13;
advisors will be responsible for the development and implementation of accounting and auditing&#13;
standards throughout enterprises and financial institutions. This component will also provide training&#13;
and a limited amount of equipment.&#13;
74.           The Consultant(s) will: review the discrepancies between current Azerbaijan&#13;
enterprise and bank accounting standards and practices and international generally accepted accounting&#13;
principles, and propose improvements to the newly enacted laws on accounting and auditing:&#13;
a.     help familiarize their counterparts with the concept, objectives, and features of&#13;
Broadly Adapted Financial Statement (BAFS), for bank accounting propose needed&#13;
amendments to these BAFS and to the accompanying instructions to facilitate their&#13;
generalized use in Azerbaijan during the interim period until the new comprehensive&#13;
accounting system will be in place;&#13;
b.     help develop the new accounting principles, chart of accounts, reporting formats, and&#13;
accounting standards for enterprises and banks. Inter alia, they will:&#13;
i.    propose accounting principles commensurate with international standards, and&#13;
guide their discussion and adoption;&#13;
ii.    help elaborate the new chart of accounts, making use of the results of the&#13;
Commonwealth of Independent States taskforce on this matter;&#13;
c.     help develop all the financial reporting formats, again making use if possible of the&#13;
similar available material, for adoption in the Republic;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
d.     coordinate, support, and guide the development of accounting standards;&#13;
e.     help develop, or otherwise provide and adapt, an instruction manual related to the&#13;
new system;&#13;
i.     will help commence the implementation of the new accounting system in close&#13;
collaboration with Azerbaijan authorities and end-users; and provide suitable&#13;
further training materials on the use of the new accounting standards and&#13;
system for the training of the NBA and tax administration officials, bank&#13;
managers and accountants, and professors;&#13;
ii.    develop an implementation schedule for the new system;&#13;
iii.   devise a publicity and education campaign on the reform.&#13;
f.    the design of new forms that the banks will have to be routinely sent for to&#13;
authorizing' regulatory and statistical purposes.&#13;
g.     will review the existing auditing system for enterprises and banks as well as the legal&#13;
framework for it, and compare them with international ones&#13;
i.     establish a framework for auditing standards;&#13;
ii.    provide drafting assistance for reforming the legal framework related to&#13;
enterprise and bank auditing;&#13;
iii.   adapt new auditing rules for enterprises and banks (including periodicity,&#13;
format of opinion, minimum scope of work to be performed, methods, etc.);&#13;
and&#13;
iv.    support the implementation of the new auditing standards, by providing&#13;
provide suitable training materials for the NBA, tax authorities, local audit&#13;
firms, professors, and bank managers and accountants on the use of the new&#13;
auditing standards; train the NBA staff and MOF staff through informal&#13;
seminars and other forms of training, especially to better familiarize the staff&#13;
with international accounting and audit concepts, including arranging&#13;
participation in overseas training; and,&#13;
h.     prepare in collaboration with selected educational institution(s) and professional&#13;
organizations a strategy for the development of basic and advanced education&#13;
programs for trainers, students, and practitioners;&#13;
i.     help define certification procedures and standards for accountants and auditors in the&#13;
enterprises and banking sector, for approval by the MOF;&#13;
j.     The Consultant will advise the Azerbaijan financial institutions on computerization of&#13;
accounting; provide guidance on hardware and software use; and include the use of&#13;
computers for accounting in the training materials and training courses outlined above&#13;
(Subcomponent V).&#13;
75.           The Consultant will take the reporting needs of the MOF, NBA and the tax&#13;
authorities, to be taken into account when drawing up the new reporting formats and regulatory&#13;
documents.&#13;
76.           Training: Although there are already training activities to be provided by the IMF&#13;
and the Bank of France for NBA and commercial bank staff in Azerbaijan, there is a need for funding&#13;
to strengthen the training activities for the NBA staff and commercial bank staff considering the lack&#13;
of modern banking skills. The training activities would range from monetary policy making to bank&#13;
supervision for the NBA staff, and from commercial bank management to risk analysis for the&#13;
commercial staff. Under this type of assistance, core staff of the NBA and commercial bank will&#13;
have financing for study tours abroad, participation in seminars, and secondments abroad. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
international trainers would also advise the NBA on the establishment of a permanent banking training&#13;
institution in Baku. This assistance will be coordinated with the IMF.&#13;
77.           The consultant team will coordinate and implement the following activities with&#13;
support from the NBA:&#13;
To design and manage the training program;&#13;
To organize the delivery of 6-7 seminars, including coordination of the selection of&#13;
participants in the seminars;&#13;
To train local training administrators and trainers;&#13;
To assist the local trainers in the preparation of the seminar contents suitable to the&#13;
local environment;&#13;
To assist the NBA in establishing a reference center on commercial banking in the&#13;
NBA;&#13;
To assist the NBA in selecting six-seven core personnel from commercial banks and&#13;
various countries for the study tours; and&#13;
To assist the NBA in planning and establishing a permanent training institution in&#13;
Azerbaijan.&#13;
78.           This component also includes study tours to developed countries for 6-7 core&#13;
personnel from the NBA and commercial banks to experience the banking practice in developed&#13;
market economies. Each tour will be for approximately one month.&#13;
(iv) Legal Technical Assistance&#13;
79.           Although the Government has enacted several laws to support a market economy,&#13;
major gaps and inconsistencies pervade the legal framework necessary for commercial activities,&#13;
including privatization, to flourish. The lack of clear legal rules in many critical areas has emerged&#13;
as a major constraint to economic development in the newly independent states of the FSU, including&#13;
Azerbaijan. To encourage a sound environment for commercial activities and development of the&#13;
private sector, the authorities recognize it is crucial that the legal framework provide clear and&#13;
predictable rules concerning: (1) commercial law, including company law, contract law, banking&#13;
laws, and the related rules governing settlement of commercial disputes; (2) property rights; (3)&#13;
market entry and exit; and (4) trade and competition to inhibit monopolistic practices.&#13;
80.           Some progress is being made in the financial sector. Within this context, the Law on&#13;
Banks and Bank's Activities in Azerbaijan and the Central Bank Law have been enacted and the IMF&#13;
is providing further assistance for the improvement of these legislation. These laws enable a two-tier&#13;
banking system in the Azerbaijan. The Land Law which was enacted in November 1991, needs&#13;
significant revision to be able to form the basis for the market economy. Currently, the lack of a&#13;
commercial law (company law) seems to be an important obstacle for Azerbaijan Republic to form a&#13;
market economy. Laws on accounting and auditing have also been enacted recently, but they need to&#13;
be further improved to facilitate the introduction of standards accepted internationally.&#13;
81.          Investors, both domestic and foreign, need confidence in the enforceability of&#13;
agreements. If there are unreasonable delays and high costs in enforcing laws and agreements&#13;
between private parties the efficient conduct of economic activities is prevented. Azerbaijan Republic&#13;
could enact the most modern commercial laws and regulations, but they will be of little practical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
value if there are no means of enforcing their provisions, or of efficiently and predictably resolving&#13;
disputes about their meaning. The investor must also have confidence that any disputes with other&#13;
parties will be resolved in a prompt and fair manner. The dispute settlement system needs to increase&#13;
its efforts to understand and adjust to the complex transactions that it will soon be required to&#13;
consider.&#13;
82.           The objective of the proposed legal technical assistance is to assist the Government in&#13;
the development and implementation of a legal framework to promote private sector activities and&#13;
assist in the transition to a market economy. The emphasis of these Terms of Reference (TOR) is on&#13;
provision of a program of legal assistance to support such framework. Flexibility and adaptability in&#13;
the implementation of the TOR will be critical for the success of the Project.&#13;
83.          In order to maintain momentum in the legal and economic reform areas, a legal&#13;
technical assistance team is proposed to be established under the provisions of the TOR which will&#13;
work with an Experts' Group comprising representatives of the Parliament, Ministry of Justice,&#13;
Legislative and Law Expertise Department of the Office of the President and other relevant agencies.&#13;
The technical assistance proposed is intended to support the economic reform program, including&#13;
provision of assistance to develop the capacity of agencies that will be needed to implement&#13;
effectively the reform program. The Experts' Group will also need support and assistance in order to&#13;
be able to: (i) provide adequate legal advice on draft legislation; (ii) to ensure that new laws are&#13;
internally consistent, or if in conflict with other laws provide for appropriate changes; and (iii)&#13;
promote better knowledge of the new laws throughout the legal profession. The assistance provided&#13;
by several donors, such as the EU, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, bilateral&#13;
donors, and assistance from various national bar associations, will also have to be effectively&#13;
coordinated.&#13;
84.           The proposed legal technical assistance would include a Legal Coordinator (LC), who&#13;
will be resident in Azerbaijan Republic for about 12-18 months. The LC would head a team of legal&#13;
experts and would be responsible for assistance in planning long-term strategy in the economic reform&#13;
area as it relates to legal infrastructure. The LC would also be expected to assist in drafting relevant&#13;
laws and supporting regulations and decrees when needed. The LC would report to the Head of the&#13;
Experts" Group.&#13;
85.          In view of the importance of the commercial law, the legal technical assistance team&#13;
would be assisted by a Commercial Law Specialist for about 6-12 months, of which about 3-4 months&#13;
would be resident in Azerbaijan Republic. This Specialist should have broad experience in the&#13;
commercial law (especially company law) area, and would be expected to contribute to the&#13;
implementation of the new law.&#13;
86.           Without a qualified and well-trained group of legal professionals, effective&#13;
implementation of the new laws and regulations required by a market economy will not be effective.&#13;
Therefore, the legal technical assistance would include a series of training programs to be&#13;
implemented under the direction of the LC with the assistance of the Experts' Group. These training&#13;
programs would focus on problems that legal professionals will encounter in the transition to a market&#13;
economy, and be aimed at an audience of judges, law professors, law students and other young&#13;
lawyers (both within and outside government), and possibly Parliamentarians involved in the legal&#13;
aspects of the economic reform program. The training would consist of seminars, lectures and other&#13;
materials provided by outside legal experts. Although it is expected that the training would mostly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
take place within Azerbaijan Republic there would be the flexibility to send local legal professionals&#13;
overseas for short-term internships.&#13;
87.            Finally, in order to more efficiently implement the work set out above, a limited&#13;
amount of equipment and supplies will be needed, including: (i) computers and computer software&#13;
for a legal database; (ii) legal text-books and comparative studies for training courses and seminars;&#13;
(iii) sample of contracts, charters and by-laws which can be used by lawyers in practical work; and&#13;
(iv) collection of international treaties and reviews of international commercial practice.&#13;
88.            Scope of Assistance. The areas of law to be covered by the technical assistance are&#13;
potentially very broad, including business/commercial law (the terms "business"and "commercial" are&#13;
used interchangeably) and legislation in the fields set out below, as they relate to (or have an effect&#13;
on) business activity. The listing below is intended as an indication of the type of areas in which the&#13;
Consultants (the terms "Consultants" and "legal assistance team" are used interchangeably in these&#13;
TOR) will provide legal expertise (assessment and diagnosis, drafting, review of drafts,&#13;
implementation, monitoring and enforcement assistance, training, and institutional development). The&#13;
listing does not imply that existing or draft legislation is inadequate or should be changed, nor that&#13;
specific laws should be enacted for each of these topics, some of which overlap with others or reflect&#13;
concepts borrowed from different legal systems. Preliminary legal assistance in some of these areas&#13;
may be provided by other sources. In such cases, the Consultants may be asked to review legislation&#13;
drafted by others in order to check its consistency with the overall legal framework and reform&#13;
program.&#13;
89.            The following is an indicative listing of potential topics: company law; bankruptcy&#13;
law; contract law; property law; real estate law (including titling, registration, etc.); protection of&#13;
intellectual property; sureties law (secured transactions, including mortgages, liens, etc.); leasing;&#13;
securities law; law of negotiable instruments (checks, notes, etc.); banking law; private accounting&#13;
and auditing; financial disclosure requirements and investor protection; insurance; competition law;&#13;
deregulation of specific sectors of economic activity, including removal of barriers to entry (legal or&#13;
de facto, such as privileges to state-owned enterprises); international business law; international public&#13;
law (relevant treaties, conventions, etc.); customs law; tax law; labor law; privatization; foreign&#13;
investment laws; commercial dispute settlement mechanisms and procedures; administrative law,&#13;
including recourse mechanisms against administrative decisions; state enterprise law, in particular&#13;
with a view to create a level playing field between private and public enterprises; public procurement&#13;
regulations; civil and criminal penalties for violations of business laws; product liability;&#13;
environmental law; economic aspects of constitutional law; and organization of legal professions&#13;
(lawyers, notaries, registrars, bailiffs, etc.).&#13;
90.            The assistance will focus not only on draft legislation and regulations, but, also on&#13;
their proper implementation and enforcement. This will, inter alia, require the development of&#13;
information and documentation sources on legal reform in the business law area, the training of staff&#13;
of concerned agencies, and assistance in developing the needed administrative and institutional&#13;
mechanisms and procedures for the application of the new legal framework. In addition mechanisms&#13;
to enforce laws and regulations will be addressed and reforms proposed as appropriate: for example,&#13;
in the area of bankruptcy a full range of assistance should be provided to help the authorities in&#13;
establishing procedures for the timely and efficient liquidation of bankrupt enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
91.           The Consultants' specific work program will be further defined in an Inception Report&#13;
to be drafted by the Consultants and approved by the Government. The content of the Inception&#13;
Report will reflect the priorities at the time and will reflect assistance received or promised from&#13;
other sources (for example, lawyers financed by other donors or by the Government). In general, the&#13;
Consultants will:&#13;
Assist in drafting key economic, financial and business legislation according to the&#13;
priorities established. The laws will be prepared with the utmost concern for&#13;
coherence, practicability, and appropriate integration with Azerbaijan Republic's legal&#13;
and cultural traditions. If the drafting of laws has already been done the Consultants'&#13;
activities will focus primarily on comments on such drafts.&#13;
Advise on institutions, including agencies, regulatory bodies, and dispute settlement&#13;
mechanisms needed to implement the new laws and regulations; and assist in&#13;
preparing appropriate implementing decrees and regulations.&#13;
Monitor implementation and enforcement of the relevant texts to identify problems or&#13;
bottlenecks in their execution.&#13;
-      Assist in designing remedies to correct implementation or enforcement problems.&#13;
92.           Training. As institution-building is an important objective of the proposed technical&#13;
assistance a basic training program for lawyers should be designed. The training will focus in&#13;
particular on the needs of lawyers working for key economic ministries and agencies, judges, law&#13;
faculties and students. Training will include: (i) on the job activities; (ii) focussed seminars and&#13;
courses; (iii) participation of selected lawyers in seminars held abroad; (iv) participation of selected&#13;
candidates in fellowships at foreign law schools; and (iv) internships at the Consultants', or other&#13;
appropriate offices.&#13;
93.           Priority will be given to training a core group of lawyers in commercial law. The&#13;
target group will include lawyers from the MOF, the Ministry of Justice, the Central Bank, and&#13;
specialized agencies, such as the SPC. Judges and others, including if appropriate, Parliamentarians&#13;
or lawyers working with Parliament, will also be included. The specific subject matters of the formal&#13;
training will be decided on the basis of an assessment to be undertaken by the Consultants of training&#13;
needs, including discussions with lawyers and others in the emerging private sector about their&#13;
perceived problems with laws and the implementation thereof.&#13;
94.           The training activities to be carried out with the assistance of the Consultants will be&#13;
tailored to the needs of the target group and adapted to the specific circumstances. They should&#13;
include:&#13;
identification of the training needs of the concerned ministries, agencies and other&#13;
bodies (including the judiciary) in the area of commercial law;&#13;
periodic seminars and talks about specific issues or developments in the area of&#13;
economic reform (in addition to on-the-job training) for Government lawyers or&#13;
advisors who are concerned with economic, financial and commercial law;&#13;
one or two courses to introduce the broader group of officials who must implement&#13;
economic, financial and business laws, to the new laws, basic concepts underlying the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
laws and relevant legal issues and techniques; one of the objectives of this type of&#13;
training activity would be to ensure uniform interpretation of laws before their&#13;
implementation;&#13;
collection and distribution of supporting teaching material, such as examples of&#13;
foreign legislation, procedures manuals, standard forms for contracts, and model&#13;
forms for company by-laws; and&#13;
other ad hoc seminars or training activities as appropriate to achieve the objectives set&#13;
forth in the TOR.&#13;
95.          Institutional Arrangements.  An Experts' Group which would be established from the&#13;
representatives of the Parliament, Ministry of Justice, Legislative and Law Expertise Department of&#13;
the Office of the President and other relevant agencies, will be the counterpart for legal technical&#13;
assistance component of this Project. However, in order to facilitate the implementation of the&#13;
Project and to coordinate the reform activities the legal assistance team will work closely with&#13;
relevant government bodies and agencies, through the Experts' Group.&#13;
96.           The Legal Assistance Team. The legal assistance team financed by the Project&#13;
includes a Resident LC for 12-18 months, a Commercial Law Specialist who will be available for&#13;
about 12 months of which about 3-4 will be resident in Azerbaijan Republic, and short-term legal&#13;
experts. The Consultants will work closely with other advisors, including legal and other advisors&#13;
recruited under other contracts and the Government's own advisors.&#13;
97.           Resident LC. The Resident LC will be assigned and report to the Head of the&#13;
Experts' Group. The LC will be the Consultants' main staff for this assignment and is expected to be&#13;
involved in all the tasks covered by these TOR. In particular, the LC will develop an overall view of&#13;
the legislation and of the new texts prepared by the various ministries or parliamentary committees.&#13;
In some instances, the LC will be the primary drafter of the legislation, in others will only provide&#13;
guidance and comments to the drafters. The LC will in all cases be involved in the preparation of&#13;
new legislation relevant to economic development in general and business activity in particular. This&#13;
should enable the LC to avoid overlapping or contradictory pieces of legislation and of other projects&#13;
in preparation. In many instances, the primary drafter will be a Government lawyer, and in others a&#13;
legal expert financed under another project or by another donor. One of the LC's main tasks will be&#13;
to assist the Government and the lawyers in ensuring: (a) cohesion in the legal framework for&#13;
business activity; and (b) prioritization of tasks to further develop said framework.&#13;
98.           At the request of specific ministries or agencies, and to the extent the work program&#13;
allows the LC, in line with priorities established by the Experts' Group, will provide assistance to&#13;
such ministries or agencies in the organization or their legal work, designing assistance packages, and&#13;
helping in identifying donors interested in providing such assistance. In coordination with the&#13;
Experts' Group, the LC will carry out the training activities set out in paragraphs 94-96.&#13;
99.           The Project will finance, in addition to the LC, short-term experts to carry out&#13;
specialized legal tasks, for which these experts are not qualified or not available due to other work&#13;
constraints. Their precise timing, subject matter, and scope will normally by agreed upon in the&#13;
context of the preparation and approval of the Consultants' Inception Report and Quarterly Reports.&#13;
Some missions will require one or more trips to Azerbaijan Republic while others could be limited to&#13;
desk work outside Azerbaijan Republic. Experts going to Azerbaijan Republic on such missions will,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
in addition to the tasks specified in their TOR, be expected to contribute to the training program&#13;
described earlier.&#13;
III. Project Costs, Financing, Procurement and Disbursements&#13;
100.         Project Costs and Financing: The total project cost is estimated at US$20.3 million&#13;
with a foreign exchange component of US$18.0 or approximately 90 percent of total costs. The&#13;
project costs have been estimated on the basis of an overall four year implementation schedule. Unit&#13;
costs of advisory and consultant services, and equipment costs are based upon rates quoted for similar&#13;
services and equipment in the FSU countries. Price contingencies averaging 5 percent have been&#13;
assumed for all project components. The project costs include the refinancing of a Project&#13;
Preparation Facility (PPF) of US$0.5 million. A summary of the Project Costs and Project Financing&#13;
Plan is given in Schedule A.&#13;
101.         The Association would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs, and&#13;
90 percent of the total project costs, excluding any taxes or duties. National costs will be in the form&#13;
of support services, and seconded staff, and would be provided in large degree by the beneficiary&#13;
agencies. Some logistical and training national costs included in the foreign financed contracts for&#13;
consulting services would be financed by the Credit.&#13;
102.         Institutional Arrangements for Project Coordination and Implementation. The&#13;
responsibility for project coordination will be with the Deputy President of the NBA. A Project&#13;
Implementation Unit (PIU), headed by a Project Manager, and reporting to the Deputy President of&#13;
the NBA, will be established for the implementation of the proposed Credit and the related reporting&#13;
and accounting activities. This unit would be assisted by a Procurement Advisor to be financed out of&#13;
the proceeds of the Credit. The Procurement Advisor would assist all the beneficiary agencies on all&#13;
procurement procedures, and monitor their implementation in accordance with the Bank Guidelines on&#13;
Procurement. The appointment of a Project Manager to head the PIU and the Procurement Advisor&#13;
are conditions of Credit effectiveness. The determination of the terms of reference, identification of&#13;
the Short Lists of consultants, the technical evaluation of bids for consultant selection, and the&#13;
technical oversight of studies and training etc. would remain the responsibility of the participating&#13;
agencies. The participating agencies will also appoint appropriate counterparts for handling&#13;
implementation of technical assistance components relevant to them.&#13;
103.         The responsibilities of the PIU include monitoring the progress under the proposed&#13;
credit, overall project implementation, and co-ordination among various participating ministries,&#13;
banks, other project beneficiaries and procurement agencies to ensure a consistent approach in the&#13;
implementation of the project. The PIU would also be responsible for the monitoring and control of&#13;
the proposed use of IDA funds, the administration of a proposed special account, overall accounting&#13;
and auditing of project accounts, and preparation of consolidated progress reports and Project&#13;
Completion Report.&#13;
104.         The consultants will work with counterpart agencies, co-ordinate with other technical&#13;
assistance consultants, monitor the progress of the technical assistance programs, and ensure the&#13;
communication of results to the NBA and the Association. They would work in close cooperation&#13;
with the PIU.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
105.          The Association would provide assistance to the Government to enable early project&#13;
start off and effective implementation. After Credit approval the Bank will send a team, including a&#13;
task manager and procurement, disbursement and some of the component specialists, who will hold a&#13;
project launch workshop to ensure that all counterparts fully understand proper procedures for&#13;
implementation. This will include Bank approval of the TOR of studies and programs financed under&#13;
the project, the criteria for selection of trainees, and the short list of consultants. The Association&#13;
would subsequently conduct a midterm review of all components, as well as other interim reviews as&#13;
needed. The Borrower and the Association would jointly review the findings of the studies and the&#13;
results of training programs. Since it is not possible to identify all essential assistance requirements&#13;
for implementation of the economic reform program at this point, and it is likely that new needs&#13;
would arise during the implementation period of this operation and a proposed Rehabilitation Credit,&#13;
an amount of US$1.0 million has been set aside and will be used as the need arises.&#13;
106.          Credit preparation costs, including start-up costs for the PIU, being financed under the&#13;
PPF, are aimed at, inter alia, contributing to the establishment of the PIU, initiating advice on&#13;
privatization and meeting the urgent needs of an interim payments system. The PIU subcomponent&#13;
would be implemented at an early date and the TOR for the consultants have been prepared.&#13;
107.          Procurement. A Country Procurement Assessment is planned for FY96. The&#13;
Government has requested the Association's assistance in developing public procurement regulations&#13;
introducing competitive procedures. Under the project, the PIU would be assisted by an experienced&#13;
procurement specialist. The specialist would advise on the preparation of public procurement&#13;
regulations consistent with international procurement practices, and train local staff to become&#13;
proficient in public procurement.&#13;
108.          The procurement under the Technical Assistance Credit would be in accordance with&#13;
Bank Guidelines for Procurement, January 1995. Under this Credit, procurement would cover&#13;
consultants, goods and services, including hardware and software. The project elements, estimated&#13;
costs, and the procurement arrangements are given in the table below, and details of the procurement&#13;
packages are presented in Schedule E.&#13;

b/ Consultant Services, according to the World Bank Consultant Guideline (1981).&#13;
c/ Training figures include costs of training subcomponents.&#13;
109.          All equipment and materials to be financed from the Bank credit would be procured in&#13;
accordance with the Bank Guidelines for Procurement and will consist of computer systems and&#13;
peripherals, software systeriis, telecommunications, privatization vouchers, office equipment, and&#13;
supplies. Contracts estimated to cost above US$300,000 equivalent will be awarded through&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB), using the World Bank's standard bidding documents&#13;
modified to suit the requirements of this package. Contracts estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$300,000 equivalent will be procured through International Shopping, based on at least three&#13;
quotations from two eligible countries the aggregate amount of goods procured under international&#13;
shopping will not exceed US$1.0 million. Contracts estimated to cost less than US$50,000 up to an&#13;
aggregate of US$100,000 may be procured through local shopping based on comparison of price&#13;
quotations from at least three eligible local suppliers.&#13;
110.          The selection of firms and individuals for consultant assignments would be in&#13;
accordance with the "Bank's Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981). TOR of all consultant assignments would be&#13;
subject to the Association's prior review. The contents of the training programs and the criteria for&#13;
selection of trainees will be agreed with the Association.&#13;
111.          Association Review. Because of the centralization of procurement in the FSU,&#13;
knowledge of project implementation agencies in international commercial practices and the Bank's&#13;
procurement procedures is limited. Therefore, all procurement activities under the project will be&#13;
coordinated by the PIU, which will be assisted by Procurement Advisor. Although standard bidding&#13;
documents will be used under the project, in order to ensure compliance with the Bank's Guidelines&#13;
for Procurement, all contracts awarded through ICB, as well as the first two contracts under&#13;
International Shopping will be subject to prior Association review. Documentation and contracts for&#13;
consultant assignments with consultant firms and (all contracts for single-source selection of&#13;
consulting firms and assignments of a critical nature as determined by the Association) valued at or&#13;
above US$100,000 and with consulting individuals valued at or above US$50,000 would be subject to&#13;
the Association'ss prior review and approval. All other contracts will be subject to selective&#13;
subsequent review by the Association.&#13;
112.          Procurement Monitoring: Procurement data would be collected and recorded for:&#13;
(i) prompt reporting of contract award information by the Borrower; (ii) comprehensive quarterly&#13;
reports to the Association by the Borrower; and (iii) revised timing of procurement actions, including&#13;
advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time for individual contracts.&#13;
113.          Disbursement. The Credit would finance: (i) 100 percent of the foreign expenditures&#13;
of imported goods, up to 100 percent of the local expenditures (ex-factory costs), and up to&#13;
75 percent of the expenditures for other items procured locally; (ii) 100 percent of expenditures" of&#13;
consultants' services, and training; and (iii) the refinancing of the PPF. Disbursement schedule is&#13;
detailed in Schedule B. The establishment of a Legal Experts' Group to coordinate the legal&#13;
technical assistance included in the project is a condition of disbursement for this component. The&#13;
1' All expenditures to be financed are net of taxes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1999 and the Credit closing date would be December&#13;
31, 1999. Withdrawal applications will be fully documented, except for expenditures against&#13;
contracts valued at less than US$50,000 equivalent, which will be made on the basis of certified&#13;
statements of expenditures detailing the individual transactions. The documentation to support these&#13;
expenditures would be retained by the PIU for at least one year after receipt by the Association of the&#13;
audit report for the year in which the last disbursement is made. This documentation would be made&#13;
available for review by the auditors (see sections below on Financial Reporting and Auditing) and the&#13;
Association upon request.&#13;
114.         To facilitate the disbursement of funds, a Special Account would be established in the&#13;
NBA. The authorized allocation to the Special Account would be US$0.5 million. The initial deposit&#13;
to the Special Account of US$0.2 million is based on project expenditures expected to be paid&#13;
through the Special Account, with a maximum amount equal to 4 months of average projected&#13;
expenditure to be financed by the Association. The account would be opened in the name of the&#13;
Borrower and would be administered by the authorized representatives of the PIU on behalf of the&#13;
Borrower. The PIU would send on a monthly basis or more frequently, if necessary, to the Bank&#13;
requests for replenishment of the Special Account for the amounts transferred. In addition, monthly&#13;
bank statements of the Special Account which have been reconciled by the Borrower would&#13;
accompany all replenishment requests.&#13;
IV. Project Accounting, Financial Reporting, and Auditing&#13;
115.         Accounting. The Borrower would have the responsibility for the appropriate&#13;
accounting of the funds provided by IDA under the Credit, for reporting on the use of these funds,&#13;
and for ensuring that audits of the financial statements or reports are submitted to the Association.&#13;
116.         The PIU (on behalf of the Borrower) would establish an appropriate accounting&#13;
system to enable information on the proper receipt and use of funds provided in accordance with the&#13;
Credit Agreement. The accounting for all Special Account Transactions and for all other project&#13;
related accounts will be maintained in accordance with accounting practices and standards satisfactory&#13;
to the Association. This should ensure timely and accurate accounting of all transactions under the&#13;
Credit.&#13;
117.         Financial Reporting. Financial reporting for the Credit would closely reflect the&#13;
specific requirements of the Credit. It would comprise a statement of receipts and payments for the&#13;
reporting period since the beginning of the program. The reporting would be in accordance with the&#13;
disbursements classified and reported by the expenditure categories agreed with the Borrower and&#13;
spelled out in the legal documents. Quarterly progress reports would be submitted by the PIU,&#13;
including a separate report in respect of the Special Account. A Project Completion Report would be&#13;
submitted to the Association by the PIU promptly after the completion of the program, and in any&#13;
event not later than six months after the Credit closing date.&#13;
118.         Auditing. A condition of the Credit would be that the financial statements and reports&#13;
on the Credit (including the Special Account) should be audited in accordance with generally accepted&#13;
auditing standards by independent auditors (preferably an international accounting/auditing firm)&#13;
acceptable to the Association.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
119.         The criteria for selecting auditors would be as follows: (a) impartial and independent&#13;
from the entity to be audited; (b) well established and reputable; (c) experienced in the type of&#13;
assignment to be undertaken; and (d) able to fulfill the TOR required within the specified timetable.&#13;
V. Environmental Aspects&#13;
120.         This project is not expected to have any significant negative environmental impact and&#13;
has been rated "C" in accordance with Operational Directive 4.01 on Environmental Assessment.&#13;
