&#13;
The Regulatory Reform and Private Enterprise Division of EDI (EDIRP) with the Parliamentary Center of&#13;
Canada conducted a seminar on Parliament and Good Governance: The Challenge of Controlling&#13;
Corruption in Kingston, Ontario, Canada from July 25-August 1, 1998. This was the second seminar&#13;
offered since the initial Laurentian Seminar on Parliament and the Challenges of Good Governance that&#13;
took place in Montebello, Canada between July 20-30, 1997. The eight-day program, the "flagship" of&#13;
EDI-CIDA (Canadian International Development Agency) collaboration, was designed to help&#13;
parliamentarians address critical, contemporary issues within a good governance framework that&#13;
stresses principles of accountability, participation and openness. Specifically, the four primary objectives&#13;
of the seminar were to: 1) present findings of studies on the factors associated with corruption and&#13;
strengthen understanding of corruption; 2) discuss case studies of successful anti-corruption policies and&#13;
highlight the role of parliament in controlling corruption; 3) raise awareness on the importance of holding&#13;
the government financially and legally accountable and promote accountability, openness, and&#13;
participation; and 4) identify concrete and effective means of improving parliamentary performance in&#13;
controlling corruption. The seminar brought together 28 parliamentarians from 21 countries (all but 2&#13;
parliamentarians were from developing countries) to discuss how they and their parliaments can tackle&#13;
the problem of corruption. Also in attendance were six observers from international agencies.&#13;
&#13;
EDI's Evaluation Unit (EDIES) utilized an end-of-course questionnaire to evaluate the seminar. Twenty-&#13;
one respondents completed the questionnaire, a response rate of 75 percent. There were 2 sections to&#13;
the questionnaire. The first section asked respondents to rate the extent to which the course met its&#13;
performance objectives through closed-ended responses. The second section asked the respondents&#13;
about the qualities of the seminar which were most and least useful to them and also allowed them to&#13;
offer suggestions for improvements through open-ended responses. A 5-point Likert type scale that&#13;
ranged from 1 = minimum to 5 = maximum was used to rate respondents' ratings for each question.&#13;
Following are summaries of the major evaluation findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     ·    The mean scores of all seminar performance indicators, including relevance, design,&#13;
          effectiveness, and objectives met exceeded 3.0, the mid-point of the 5-point scale. Additionally,&#13;
          only four of the twenty-six questions in total did not exceed a mean of 4.0 (mean scores in the&#13;
          high or above average range are defined as 4.0 to 4.8; low or below average mean scores are&#13;
          from 3.5 to 3.9). Respondents indicated that the course was relevant to their current work or&#13;
          functions and relevant to their country's needs. Respondents' mean score for both indicators was&#13;
          4.4 out of 5.0.&#13;
&#13;
     ·    A high range of scores was awarded to 3 of the 4 primary seminar objectives. The highest overall&#13;
          mean score attained (4.8) was for how the seminar raised awareness on the importance of&#13;
          holding the government financially and legally accountable and promoting accountability,&#13;
          openness, and participation for parliamentarians. Similarly, the seminar was highly rated (4.5) for&#13;
          presenting findings of studies on the factors associated with corruption and for strengthening&#13;
          parliamentarians' understanding of corruption. A mean of 4.2 was given to how the seminar&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  identified concrete and effective means of improving parliamentary performance in controlling&#13;
  corruption. However, the seminar's objective of discussing case studies of successful anti-&#13;
  corruption policies highlighting the role of parliament in controlling corruption received a mean&#13;
  score of 3.8, the lowest for any of its four primary objectives.&#13;
&#13;
· An appreciation of both the complexity and importance of the issues was also rated above&#13;
  average by the seminar's respondents. The mean for both categories was 4.6, with 95 percent of&#13;
  the respondents awarding a score of 4 or 5.&#13;
&#13;
· The overall effectiveness of the seminar was rated highly by the respondents. The mean for this&#13;
  category was 4.4, with 95 percent of the respondents awarding a score of 4 or 5.&#13;
&#13;
· Increasing parliamentarians' understanding of important issues was another vital component of&#13;
  the seminar. The respondents indicated that the seminar helped them to understand the key&#13;
  elements of a realistic parliamentary action plan. The mean for this was 4.2 and 91 percent of the&#13;
  respondents gave this category a score of 4 or 5. Additionally, the respondents indicated that&#13;
  their understanding of the role of other groups involved in controlling corruption had been&#13;
  improved by participating in the seminar. A mean of 4.2 was awarded for this category.&#13;
&#13;
· Creating partnerships with others has been envisioned as one means of controlling corruption.&#13;
  Results indicated that the seminar was helpful for the respondents in identifying areas for further&#13;
  cooperation with others. The mean for this was 4.2. However, relatively lower mean scores were&#13;
  observed in the effectiveness of the seminar in facilitating partnerships with others involved on&#13;
  the issues. Respondents mean scores for this was 3.9. This suggests that the respondents may&#13;
  need further direction and advice on the proper people they should work with to combat&#13;
  corruption.&#13;
&#13;
· The seminar received high performance ratings in three other areas. Respondents felt that the&#13;
  seminar maintained their interest during its full duration. The usefulness of the sub-committee&#13;
  meetings in facilitating in-depth discussion was also seen as helpful by the respondents.&#13;
  Additionally, the respondents indicated that the time between topics was well balanced. The&#13;
  percentages of scores between 4 and 5 for respondents' ratings on these three indicators fell&#13;
  between 81-95 percent. Each of the three mean scores were 4.3 out of 5.0. A lower rating of 4.1,&#13;
  however, was assigned to how focused the seminar was on the issues which the respondents&#13;
  felt needed to be addressed.&#13;
&#13;
· The respondents' rating of how much they learned about practical solutions which they had not&#13;
  previously considered had a mean score of 3.7 out of 5.0, the lowest rating of the course&#13;
  performance indicators. Sixty-seven percent of the respondents gave a score of 4 or 5 to this&#13;
  question, while 10% rated it with a 1 or 2. This implies that the respondents needed more&#13;
  practical answers to their problems on corruption. It also suggests that there may have been&#13;
  many seminar topics which were not new to them or relevant to their concerns.&#13;
&#13;
· An analysis of the open-ended questions had several notable findings. It was revealed that the&#13;
  respondents' exchange of experiences with their seminar colleagues from around the world&#13;
  contributed to the usefulness of the seminar. Additionally, the respondents stated that one of&#13;
  their intentions as a result of the seminar would be to share their experiences with other&#13;
  members of their countries. The respondents also indicated that they would strive to remain in&#13;
  contact with each other to further share ideas and experiences. Finally, the respondents&#13;
  indicated that better translation of the speakers and materials in the seminar and holding regional&#13;
  seminars would both help to improve future seminars such as this one.&#13;
