INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
A.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The  World Bank/United Nations Development Group      (UNDG) Needs&#13;
Assessment for Iraq dated September 2003 identified two phases in restoring the key&#13;
productive activities in Iraq. The first phase focuses on the short-term need for stabilizing&#13;
the economy by attending to the critical problems of restoration of essential services and&#13;
employment. The second phase would address the more intermediate and long-term&#13;
needs of rehabilitating the run-down infrastructure and allocating resources towards&#13;
efficiency enhancement and generation of a competitive market economy. The total&#13;
estimated funding requirement for agriculture, water resources and food security was&#13;
estimated to be US$1.85 billion over four years.&#13;
2.    The International Conference of Donors for Iraq held in Madrid on October 23-&#13;
24, 2003 expressed support for the Needs Assessment and pledged about US$32 billion&#13;
for the four-year period covered by the Needs Assessment. Donors also asked the World&#13;
Bank and UNDG to set up an International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq to&#13;
ensure swift, flexible, and coordinated donor financing for priority investments consistent&#13;
with the Needs Assessment. The Facility now consists of two trust funds-a World Bank&#13;
Iraq Trust Fund and a UNDG Trust Fund-each with its own characteristics and terms of&#13;
reference and with a structure that ensures close coordination.&#13;
3.    In support of the short-term Phase 1 actions, the World Bank earmarked US$20&#13;
million from the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) to finance urgent activities in rural&#13;
areas, including the emergency rehabilitation of priority irrigation, drainage and water&#13;
and sanitation in an Emergency Community Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(ECIRP).&#13;
The Rural Areas of Iraq&#13;
4.    Twenty seven percent of Iraq's total population of 26 million lives in rural areas.&#13;
In 1975 the agricultural sector used to provide employment for about 31 percent of the&#13;
population. This fell to about 20 percent by 1990 because of poorly implemented land&#13;
reforms, the introduction of agricultural mechanization and increasing job opportunities&#13;
in the urban areas. However, following large-scale unemployment after the start of the&#13;
UN sanctions in 1990 many people went back to agriculture and back to the rural areas of&#13;
Iraq. By 2002, employment in the agricultural sector again reached an estimated 32&#13;
percent of total employment. There has been little investment in the rural areas over the&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
past decade, leaving much of the infrastructure (including irrigation and water supply&#13;
services) in a very poor state of repair. Unemployment remains widespread.&#13;
Rehabilitation of existing infrastructure could have a rapid impact on the lives of the rural&#13;
population by improving domestic water supplies and increasing economic opportunities&#13;
in irrigated agriculture.&#13;
The Water Sector&#13;
4.    As elsewhere, water is a critical element of Iraq's agriculture and the rural&#13;
economy. About half of the country's total cultivated area is in the northeastern plains&#13;
and mountain valleys, where rainfall sustains agriculture. The remainder of the cultivated&#13;
land is in the valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, which receive scant rainfall and&#13;
rely instead on water from the rivers. The peak natural flow of the rivers is in the spring,&#13;
but the flow can be adjusted by a series of dams and hydraulic structures on the rivers and&#13;
their tributaries. However, even with these dams in place, the flow of the rivers varies&#13;
considerably every year and destructive flooding, particularly of the Tigris, is frequent.&#13;
5.    About 98 percent of Iraq's renewable water resources come from surface water&#13;
and two percent from groundwater. Most of the water that is utilized is dedicated to&#13;
agriculture (about 87 percent), while industry uses about 8 percent and about 5 percent&#13;
goes for municipal use. The country has a very old and established irrigation system, two&#13;
thirds of which is supplied by gravity through major canal systems controlled by river&#13;
intakes, diversion weirs, etc. or directly from reservoirs, and about a third is pumped from&#13;
rivers and major channels. An extensive canal network exists within the river basins from&#13;
which water is diverted to fields for agriculture. The major hydraulic infrastructure&#13;
consists of a series of dams and barrages located on both rivers. The big dams are multi-&#13;
purpose (hydroelectric, irrigation, domestic) and the smaller dams are built to supply&#13;
water to cities and irrigation schemes.&#13;
6.    These major structures have operated for a long time without maintenance or&#13;
proper management plans. A majority of the pumping stations were built in the early&#13;
1970s, and only three stations are relatively new. An estimated US$1.5 billion was spent&#13;
under the Oil-for-Food program to replace worn out components of the pumping stations,&#13;
procurement of heavy equipment for canal cleaning and procurement of irrigation pumps&#13;
and sprinkler systems. But after the war in 2003, over 500 large irrigation and drainage&#13;
pumping stations were still reported to be in bad state of repair, and many rural&#13;
communities were cut off from their economic activities because of the breakdown of&#13;
irrigation and drainage systems.&#13;
7.    In 2003, provisions were made under donor funding to replace 31 pumps and&#13;
ancillary equipment to prevent the impending breakdown of key elements in the system.&#13;
But the primary, secondary and tertiary canal and drainage networks remained degraded&#13;
for the most part due to lack of maintenance. Breakage of canal linings, outgrowth of&#13;
weeds and sedimentation have reduced their conveyance capacity significantly, and&#13;
increased water losses enormously. Repairs to these systems can provide quick returns. In&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
northem Iraq irrigated lands are scattered over small farms in the mountain areas or&#13;
intermediate valleys and use water diverted from streams or springs. Most of the&#13;
infrastructure in this region also has deteriorated although some rehabilitation of small&#13;
gravity irrigation schemes was achieved under the Oil-for Food program. Much remains&#13;
to be done, however, throughout the country. The project would help rehabilitate some of&#13;
these small-scale schemes.&#13;
Rural Water and Sanitation&#13;
8.    Iraq's water and sewage system has also been severely disrupted by the conflicts&#13;
and the ensuing period of disorder. Looting and sabotage decimated stocks and&#13;
equipment supplies, including water purification chemicals, and damaged water-testing&#13;
labs.&#13;
9.    In rural areas, particularly in the south, the water sources for washing and&#13;
domestic use are extremely unreliable and dangerous for the people. Access to potable&#13;
water is estimated to be only 46 percent in rural areas. Sanitation facilities are in a similar&#13;
precarious state and 25 percent of the population lack safe sewage facilities. One of the&#13;
most serious consequences of the poor water and sanitation condition in rural areas has&#13;
been a sharp increase in waterbome diseases.&#13;
10.   A quick response from UNDP, with funding from the European Commission&#13;
Humanitarian Affairs Office (ECHO), helped relieve some of the immediate problems of&#13;
water and sanitation in major urban areas such as Baghdad, Basrah, and Mosul. But&#13;
despite these donor efforts, rural areas still have enormous need for help, and the project&#13;
would aim at providing this help.&#13;
The Difficult Implementation Environment&#13;
11.   The following special concerns need to be taken into account in the design and&#13;
organization of the project:&#13;
Continuing Insecurity: Violence and civil strife continue to undermine rehabilitation&#13;
efforts, and are the most important factors currently slowing operations. Insecurity has&#13;
particularly affected the redeployment of intemational aid agencies to the rural areas and&#13;
is substantially limiting local staff movement. Moreover, even though mass looting has&#13;
stopped, theft and destruction remain a high risk in some areas, posing an important&#13;
problem for all programs. Under the project, the risk of delays due to insecurity will be&#13;
mitigated by giving priority to work sites in lower risk areas.&#13;
Limited Administrative Capacity: Many senior Iraqi personnel were removed from&#13;
office after the war in 2003 leaving many ministries with significantly reduced technical&#13;
and decision-making capacity. In addition, damaged physical facilities of different&#13;
govemment establishments made working particularly difficult. The rebuilding of&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
physical facilities and administrative capacity at both the national and locai levels has&#13;
become necessary for planning and implementation of activities. Consulting support will&#13;
be provided as necessary to improve administrative capacity.&#13;
Inadequate Institutional Capacity: Iraq lacks many fundamental institutional capacities&#13;
for undertaking development activities. Foremost is the inadequacy of the existing&#13;
financial sector. The state-owned banks, which form the core of the banking system, are&#13;
nearly dysfunctional. The country therefore faces a major challenge in financial&#13;
management of its development budget. A weak private sector, including the construction&#13;
and contracting, will also impede rapid development work. In essence, the low absorptive&#13;
capacity of the system, particularly in rural areas, may slow down the pace of&#13;
development. Financial systems and procedures under the project have been designed to&#13;
take account of these weaknesses.&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B.    DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Project Rationale&#13;
12.   Bringing water to rural communities by rehabilitating water supply, sanitation,&#13;
irrigation and drainage systems can provide early wins in Iraq, with potentially high&#13;
economic and social benefits particularly in the south of Iraq where there is an acute&#13;
water shortage. The proposed Emergency Community Infrastructure Rehabilitation&#13;
Project would help Iraq address urgent water rehabilitation needs in rural areas while at&#13;
the same time creating opportunities for employment. However, there is ongoing conflict&#13;
in Iraq, and access to many areas is restricted. Furthermore, the Bank lacks experience in&#13;
Iraq, is unfamiliar with the operations of the Ministry of Water Resources [MOWR] and&#13;
has only limited knowledge of the dynamics of rural communities. And although the&#13;
MOWR has general ideas about where the priorities are and what needs to be done, it&#13;
does not have a pipeline of pre-prepared subprojects ready for implementation. In this&#13;
situation, in order to respond rapidly and effectively to rural water rehabilitation needs, a&#13;
programmatic approach is proposed to be adopted which will allow a flexible response by&#13;
the Bank. The project takes into account the important work being carried out by other&#13;
donor and agencies, such as USAID, UNDG, and FAO.&#13;
Alternatives Project Proposals Considered and Reasons for Rejection&#13;
13.   Two other major alternatives to the current proposal for the programmatic&#13;
approach to be used in the ECIRP were considered and rejected for the rural areas before&#13;
the current project was finalized: (i) a large-scale irrigation drainage project; (ii) a&#13;
community-driven development (CDD) approach. A series of large-scale projects were&#13;
designed by external consultants for the MOWR during the early 1980s. These included&#13;
major irrigation schemes and civil works, but none of them have been implemented&#13;
during the past 20 years. It was thought initially, that these very detailed technical&#13;
specifications could accelerate the design process and form the basis for a comprehensive&#13;
program of emergency works. However, when the documents were reviewed, they were&#13;
found to be out of date. Furthermore, there was a concern that the majority of the works&#13;
had many inter-dependencies that could not easily be split into smaller modules. This&#13;
large-scale project approach was therefore rejected. The second alternative of CDD based&#13;
on mobilizing local communities was rejected because the security, logistical and&#13;
political situation is not ready for this type of grass roots project. The final decision was&#13;
to support relatively simple small-scale (less than US$1 million) subprojects in the water&#13;
sector using a flexible programmatic approach which is more in tune with the current&#13;
situation in rural Iraq.&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Approach&#13;
14.   The ECIRP is primarily designed as an emergency operation. Its overriding&#13;
purpose is to focus on immediate rehabilitation needs in the water sector in rural areas.&#13;
The project will finance four subprojects already identified by the MOWR (see Part A&#13;
below), in addition to subprojects that will be identified during project implementation&#13;
(see Part B below). It is expected that 20-24 subprojects will be financed under the&#13;
project overall. The project will finance feasibility studies for subprojects to be financed&#13;
under Part B, and to develop a pipeline of subprojects for future implementation, thereby&#13;
facilitating the continuation of reconstruction interventions in the rural areas into the&#13;
medium-term. Given the high risks resulting from the current situation in Iraq and the&#13;
lack of recent experience in implementing development projects and programs in Iraq,&#13;
the project design has been kept as simple and flexible as possible to facilitate&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Project Development Objective&#13;
15.   The objective of the project is to address current emergency needs in Iraq for&#13;
infrastructure rehabilitation at the community level and generate employment. This will&#13;
cover the restoration of rural infrastructure using labor-intensive, small-scale civil works&#13;
programs for water supply, sanitation, irrigation and drainage infrastructure subprojects.&#13;
Detailed Features&#13;
16.   Part A: Subprojects in Municipalities of Al Muthanna. Al Amara. Nassariyah. and&#13;
Sulaymanivah&#13;
Subprojects for rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage, water supply and sanitation&#13;
facilities in Municipalities of Al Muthanna, Al Amara, Nassariyah, and Sulaymaniyah.&#13;
Four subprojects in these regions have already been identified including the small-scale&#13;
irrigation and drainage rehabilitation schemes and the rehabilitation of 20 multipurpose&#13;
wells (Annex 2).&#13;
Part B: Subprojects to be Identified in Other Priority Areas&#13;
Subprojects for rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage, water supply and sanitation&#13;
facilities in other priority areas. Twelve subprojects distributed across Iraq have been&#13;
identified by MOWR at the feasibility level and are being further processed. Other&#13;
subprojects are also under review by the MOWR.&#13;
Part C: Preparation of Feasibility Studies&#13;
The preparation of feasibility and design studies for (i) priority small-scale work&#13;
to be implemented under the project; and (ii) large-scale projects which could be&#13;
implemented subsequent to the project under other sources of financing.&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Part D: Project Management and Capacity Building&#13;
Support to the management of the project including: (i) the establishment of a&#13;
Project Management Team (PMT) in the MOWR; (ii) the provision of technical&#13;
assistance and training in project management, procurement and financial management;&#13;
(iii) capacity building to ensure the appropriate transfer of skills to the staff of the&#13;
Recipient; and (iv) the employment of experts to assist with project management and&#13;
capacity building activities; and (v) the provision of equipment for the PMT (see Annex 8&#13;
for details).&#13;

17.   Subproject Size: Investment in rehabilitation subprojects are expected to be in&#13;
the range of US$300,000 to US$1,000,000 per individual intervention, while the&#13;
maximum amount of financing of feasibility studies, which will be determined during the&#13;
identification of such proposals, will not exceed US$300,000 per study. Proposals for&#13;
feasibility/preparation studies and subproject works will be encouraged from all the&#13;
Governorates in the country, with no regional preferences, taking the security situation&#13;
into account.&#13;
18.   Expected Outputs: The expected outputs of the ECIRP project are:&#13;
(i)    Several rehabilitated water supply, sanitation, irrigation and drainage&#13;
infrastructure schemes; it is expected that 20-24 subprojects will be&#13;
financed overall.&#13;
(ii)  Increased short-term employment in project areas;&#13;
(iii)  A portfolio of priority rural water infrastructure projects complete with&#13;
feasibility and design studies. Some smaller scale schemes would be&#13;
financed out of ECIRP proceeds. Larger projects would be financed by&#13;
subsequent projects/programs;&#13;
(iv)  Increased capacity at the local, regional and central levels to plan and&#13;
implement small-scale infrastructure reconstruction projects.&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
C.     PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND INSTITUTIONAL&#13;
ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
Implementing Agency&#13;
19.   The MOWR will implement the ECIRP. Other ministries responsible for rural&#13;
infrastructure will be consulted on the feasibility and design studies. The responsibility&#13;
matrix for various tasks is shown in Annex 3. A Project Coordinator has been appointed&#13;
from within the staff of the MOWR. The Project Coordinator is based within the Unit of&#13;
the Special Advisor for Engineering and Planning within the MOWR. The Project&#13;
Coordinator is forming a Project Management Team (PMT) and coordinating across the&#13;
various ministerial units contributing to the implementation of the ECIRP (the lighter-&#13;
shaded boxes in the organigram below):&#13;
20.    The PMT will be supported by external consultants hired under the ECIRP (PMT&#13;
consultants). Specific consultants, among others to be decided at a later stage, will&#13;
include a Financial Management Specialist, a Procurement/Disbursement Specialist and a&#13;
Senior Technical Advisor (draft TORs for all three positions are in Annex 4).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Functions of PMT&#13;
21.   Specific functions of the Project Coordinator and the Project Management Team,&#13;
supported by the PMT consultants, will include the following project management core&#13;
functions:&#13;
(i)   Managing the project in accordance with the Operational Manual.&#13;
(ii)  Supervising and overseeing the implementation of the subprojects, including:&#13;
identifying and preparing proposals for feasibility studies and subprojects on a&#13;
rolling plan for inclusion in the ECIRP according to the agreed selection criteria&#13;
and supervising consultants and contractors in the field ensuring adequate quality&#13;
of consultant and contractor performance and compliance with the terms of&#13;
reference.&#13;
(iii)  Developing terms of reference for feasibility studies (consultant services) and&#13;
subproject implementation (rehabilitation works) and procuring services,&#13;
equipment and works in accordance with the procurement plan and applicable&#13;
World Bank Guidelines.&#13;
(iv)  Preparing payment requests related to feasibility studies and subproject&#13;
implementation, including processing of payments, suspension, termination, and&#13;
contract close out.&#13;
(v)   Regular reporting on project progress, financial status and impact..&#13;
(vi)  Organizing promotional activities in project areas to inform communities of&#13;
project objectives and procedures.&#13;
Subproject Preparation and Review Responsibilities&#13;
22.   The MOWR will identify and prepare the priority subprojects to be funded under the&#13;
project involving the rehabilitation of water supply systems, sanitation facilities, irrigation canals&#13;
and drainage infrastructure. Eligibility of subprojects will be determined according to the&#13;
selection criteria set out below covering technical, economic and environmental soundness, and&#13;
readiness for implementation. The MOWR and the Ministry of Planning and Development&#13;
Cooperation will review the proposed program and ensure that there is no overlap or duplication&#13;
with other donors' activities, and the Iraqi Strategic Review Board will review and provide&#13;
approval as required. Finalized subproject proposals and feasibility study proposals will be&#13;
submitted to the World Bank for review and approval prior to implementation.&#13;
Subproject Approval Criteria&#13;
23.   Approval by MOWR and the Bank of any proposed subprojects or feasibility studies will&#13;
be subject to proposals meeting the agreed criteria listed below. As the process moves forward,&#13;
these criteria may be revised and modified in line with project objectives by mutual agreement&#13;
between MOWR and the Bank. The activities to be financed under the ECIRP will have to meet&#13;
the following basic criteria:&#13;
(i)   Each activity must receive approval through the Iraqi Strategy Review Board&#13;
(ISRB) as a priority emergency project prior to implementation.&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(ii)  Proposed subprojects and feasibility studies should be for rural areas, focusing on&#13;
water supply, sanitation, irrigation or drainage rehabilitation.&#13;
(iii)  Proposals should be labor-intensive, utilizing local labor inputs as much as&#13;
practicable.&#13;
(iv)  Individual feasibility study packages supported by the project should not exceed a&#13;
total cost of US$300,000, and for rehabilitation subprojects should be in the range&#13;
of US$300,000 to US$1,000,000.&#13;
(v)   Feasibility studies and subprojects should meet the specific appraisal criteria.&#13;
(vi)  Subprojects for immediate implementation and feasibility/subproject preparation&#13;
studies should be in compliance with the World Bank's Environmental and Social&#13;
Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF) - (see Working Papers).&#13;
(vii)  Subprojects need to have acceptable economic indicators:&#13;
*  In the case of irrigation and drainage subprojects, the indicator to be used&#13;
will be the Capital/Output [C/O] ratio (in this case the ratio of the economic&#13;
cost per hectare under the subproject compared with the induced value of&#13;
incremental production per hectare per annum at full development). The&#13;
maximum allowable C/O ratio as defined will generally be 10.&#13;
*  For water supply and sanitation subprojects, proposals will be selected on&#13;
the basis of the solution which results in the least economic cost for the&#13;
provision of services to the selected community. The selection process for&#13;
water and sanitation subprojects will favor those projects which allow a&#13;
maximum number of beneficiaries at the lowest reasonable cost.&#13;
24.   In general, subproject proposals should be based on perceived immediate needs of local&#13;
communities for irrigation and drainage services and attend to the most urgent rehabilitation&#13;
works in rural areas. For this reason, MOWR will develop these proposals in consultation with&#13;
local communities. Furthermore, proposals should be:&#13;
(i)   Free of resettlement, relocation and land acquisition issues;&#13;
(ii)  Not budgeted from other resources;&#13;
(iii)  Consistent with MOWR's strategic priorities and plans;&#13;
(iv)  Prepared in consultation with other line Ministries where feasibility studies for new&#13;
proposals are involved so as to avoid duplication and conflict.&#13;

Documentation Required for Rehabilitation Subproject Proposals&#13;
25.   For rehabilitation subprojects, the PMTIMOWR would complete a Subproject Proposal&#13;
Form (Annex 1) that includes the following information:&#13;
(i)   Brief description of socio-economic conditions in the proposed communities;&#13;
(ii)  Rationale for community targeting and priority water supply, sanitation, irrigation&#13;
or drainage infrastructure needs;&#13;
(iii)  Technical design or sketches and any technical assessment;&#13;
(iv)  A brief economic benefit analysis;&#13;
(v)   Bill of quantities;&#13;
(vi)  Simplified plan and budget for operation and maintenance;&#13;
(vii)  Copies of written licenses and permiits for proposed work; and&#13;
(viii) Applicable forms and data sheets of the ESSAF.&#13;
26.   The MOWR has already identified and dimensioned a small number of high priority&#13;
rehabilitation projects, including three irrigation rehabilitation systems in the south near Basra&#13;
and a drinking-water well rehabilitation project in the Kurdish region in the north of Iraq - see&#13;
details in Annex 2. These proposals will need to be carefully reviewed by the MO)WR and&#13;
subsequently by the Bank's consultants, and then approved by the Bank. Once cleared, they will&#13;
be able to access ECIRP financing for immediate execution.&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Documentation Required for Feasibility Study Proposals&#13;
27.   Proposals seeking approval to carry out feasibility studies prepared by MOWR should&#13;
include the following information:&#13;
(i)   Brief description of socio-economic conditions in the area covered;&#13;
(ii)  Rationale for community targeting and priority irrigation/drainage infrastructure&#13;
needs;&#13;
(iii)  Description of scope of the feasibility study, including envisaged types of&#13;
interventions; and&#13;
(iv)  Initial cost estimates for consultancy services for developing the feasibility study;&#13;
Supervision and Monitoring by the World Bank&#13;
28.   Given the current security conditions and the lack of World Bank field presence in Iraq,&#13;
there is a need for an innovative and flexible approach to implementation, including supervision,&#13;
monitoring, training and disbursement procedures. For this, the project will draw on the&#13;
supervision experiences of other donors operating in Iraq. World Bank monitoring and&#13;
supervision activities would be supported by three separate groups of consultants financed&#13;
through the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund to ensure compliance with fiduciary, safeguard and&#13;
technical aspect of the Bank's responsibilities. In each case, consultants would report to the&#13;
World Bank and make recommendations concerning their area of responsibility. The World&#13;
Bank would communicate the World Bank's views to the Recipient.&#13;
29.   The three groups of consultants would be:&#13;
*     The World Bank Monitoring Agent handling fiduciary matters (financial&#13;
management and procurement);&#13;
*     The World Bank Monitoring Agent handling safeguard aspects (environmental&#13;
and social);&#13;
*     World Bank consultants handling technical aspects.&#13;
30.   In the case of the Monitoring Agents, two consulting firms will be hired to handle all&#13;
projects being financed under the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund. In the case of the technical&#13;
consultants, an engineering consulting company will be hired specifically for this project. The&#13;
fiduciary Monitoring Agent will review compliance by the Recipient with the requirements of&#13;
the Grant Agreement on fiduciary matters and the detailed financial and procurement provisions&#13;
of this Technical Annex (specifically Annexes 5 &amp; 6 of this Technical Annex). The safeguard&#13;
Monitoring Agent will ensure compliance with the Environmental and Social Screening and&#13;
Assessment Framework (ESSAF), which is included in the Working Papers to this report. The&#13;
technical consultants will help expedite and monitor project progress on behalf of the World&#13;
Bank. They will interact with staff of the Ministry responsible for project implementation, the&#13;
MOWR, and their consultants and carry out field assessments as necessary to carry out this&#13;
work. The technical consultants will report findings to the World Bank and make&#13;
recommendations. Making use of these findings and recommendations, the Bank would then&#13;
communicate the Bank's views on project related matters to the MOWR.&#13;
31.   Detailed Terms of Reference for these technical consultants are in Annex 7The scope of&#13;
work of the technical consulting company would cover:&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
*     A review of subprojects proposed by MOWR and an assessment of whether they&#13;
meet the agreed selection criteria.&#13;
*     A review of final designs of selected subprojects and bidding documents for their&#13;
execution.&#13;
*     A review of in-progress and completed sub projects to assess quality of work by&#13;
contractors and supervision by MOWR and their consultants.&#13;
*     A review of the selection of proposed feasibility studies to be conducted under the&#13;
project, TOR for these studies and the completed studies.&#13;
*     Reporting to the World Bank.&#13;
32.   During site visits, the technical consultants will examine the submitted proposals for&#13;
feasibility studies and rehabilitation subprojects according to the selection checklist described in&#13;
Annex 1.&#13;
33.   Upon its completion, the technical consultant will submit the appraisal package to the&#13;
World Bank, and inform the PMT / MOWR of the respective recommendation. The consultant&#13;
may recommend the approval or rejection of each of the individual projects, after evaluating&#13;
whether the project has followed the selection criteria adequately.&#13;
34.   The World Bank would review the proposal within 10 working days and approve or&#13;
reject the proposed package based on the consultant's recommendations and own judgment. The&#13;
World Bank may also recommend a revision of the subproject proposal and ask for re-&#13;
submission.&#13;
35.   In the event the Bank rejects the proposed rehabilitation subproject, it may consider&#13;
including the rejected proposal under the feasibility study development process and provide&#13;
approval accordingly. The World Bank will inform the PMT of its decision and advise. on the&#13;
procurement arrangements for consultant services to develop a full feasibility/project preparation&#13;
study.&#13;
Subproject/Feasibility Study Completion and Evaluation&#13;
36.   A Committee of Senior Engineers from the MOWR will be responsible for Quality&#13;
Control and Quality Assurance of subprojects and feasibility studies and verify the satisfactory&#13;
completion of the works and quantities and consultants. A contract close-out checklist will be&#13;
prepared by the Resident Engineer / Designated Official and the Project Coordinator and a copy&#13;
of this will be sent to the appropriate authority to effect final payment to the contractor and&#13;
supplier and/or consultant. The Resident Engineer / Designated Official shall provide a&#13;
Certificate of Satisfactory Work Performed.&#13;
Training and Technical Assistance&#13;
37.   If conditions permit, training will be made available to: (i) PMT and other staff of the&#13;
MOWR; and (ii) representatives of local governments and communities. The Project&#13;
Coordinator, supported by the PMT and PMT consultants, will be responsible for identifying&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
training needs and processing requests for training. Training programs for MOWR project staff&#13;
will be provided to the MOWR to strengthen capacity in technical, project management and&#13;
fiduciary skills, including environmental and social safeguards. With regard to training of&#13;
individuals from local governments and communities (who are not staff of the PMT/MOWR) the&#13;
PMT will be responsible for identifying training and further TA needs and ascertaining the&#13;
willingness on the part of communities to receive training or technical assistance. Training&#13;
activities for local communities and governments will be implemented and funded under the&#13;
ECIRP as part of the individual subprojects.&#13;
38.   The proposed implementation timetable for the project is as follows:&#13;
Implementation Timetable&#13;

13 Audits&#13;
Subproject Operation and Maintenance&#13;
39.   The longstanding tradition in Iraq of centralized service provision has tended to create a&#13;
dependency mentality, with the result that community-based organizations are weak or non-&#13;
existent. Furthermore, NGOs are entirely absent, and there is an absence of informal interface&#13;
between the rigid state structure and the communities. Consequently, there is only a limited&#13;
history of user associations and the collection of tariffs, which traditionally ensure a sense of&#13;
ownership and contributes to the ongoing operation and maintenance of the installed works.&#13;
40.   Securing an adequate level of operation and maintenance is essential for the long-term&#13;
sustainability of the works. Accordingly, the project will make every effort to develop local&#13;
support systems, which will assist the beneficiary communities in achieving this objective. The&#13;
project will also encourage the MOWR Regional Directorates to play a more active role in&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
providing technical assistance and resources. As NGOs develop (and there is already evidence&#13;
that this is occurring), they will also be encouraged to engage with the communities to establish&#13;
user associations leading to greater self-sustainability.&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
D.    PROCUREMENT&#13;
Types of Procurement&#13;
41.   Procurement for this project will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and&#13;
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May&#13;
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement.&#13;
42.   The general description of various items under different expenditure categories are&#13;
described below. For each contract to be financed by the Grant, the different procurement&#13;
methods or consultant selection methods are specified in the Procurement Arrangement (PA)&#13;
(Annex 5). The PA will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project&#13;
implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.&#13;
43.   Procurement of Works: The procurement will be done using a National Standard&#13;
Bidding Document (SBD) satisfactory to the World Bank. Smaller works will be procured under&#13;
lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded to the lowest bidder with requisite experience and&#13;
resources to complete the contract successfully on basis of quotations obtained from three&#13;
qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation.&#13;
44.   Procurement of Goods: The procurement will be done using the National SBD&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank. Shopping will be used as depicted in the procurement arrangement.&#13;
Selection of Consultants:&#13;
45.   Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent&#13;
per contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provisions&#13;
of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
Implementing Agency Capacity Building&#13;
46.   The project will support the training of one MOWR./PMT procurement staff for an&#13;
estimated duration of 6 weeks in two cycles of 3 weeks each.&#13;
Assessment of the Agency's Capacity to Implement Procurement&#13;
47.   Procurement activities will be carried out by the MOWR through a Procurement Officer&#13;
within the PMT who will be guided by a procurement management consultant throughout project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
48.   The overall project risk for procurement is high. Most of the risks concerning&#13;
procurement have been identified in a procurement capacity assessment carried out by the Bank&#13;
in August 2003 and include:&#13;
16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(i)   The lack of good laws and regulations, of modem standard documentation, and&#13;
the habits acquired by procurement staff in the previous era, which will take time&#13;
to be changed;&#13;
(ii)  Weakness of procurement staff in procurement using Bank procurement&#13;
guidelines and international sound procurement practice; and&#13;
(iii)  Inability of Bank procurement staff to supervise the project in the field.&#13;
49.   The corrective measures, which have been agreed, are:&#13;
(i)   A procurement officer will be hired to be part of the PMT in the MOWR (see&#13;
draft Terms of Reference for this position in Annex 4)&#13;
(ii)  An international procurement management firm will be recruited to assist the&#13;
PMT in procurement, train the ministries staff on procurement and construction&#13;
management, establish a procurement monitoring and reporting system and&#13;
conduct spot physical inspections&#13;
(iii)  A decree to be issued by the MOWR to rectify the critical shortcomings in the&#13;
current procurement practice.&#13;
17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
E.    FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
50.   The proposed grant will be disbursed to rehabilitate small-scale irrigation,&#13;
drainage, water supply and sanitation subprojects costing around US$300,000 to&#13;
US$1,000,000 each and to finance feasibility studies costing US$300,000 or less each.&#13;
The MOWR will implement the project activities over a period of two years.&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
51.   The Bank's strategy in Iraq is to ensure Iraqi ownership and strengthen&#13;
institutional capacity by financing operations that are implemented by Iraqi ministries&#13;
and other recipient entities. Trained Project Management Teams (PMTs) will facilitate&#13;
implementation and help ensure compliance with fiduciary and other safeguards. PMTs&#13;
will be employed and paid by the implementing entity at regular salary levels, thereby&#13;
avoiding the disadvantages of stand-alone Project Implementation Units that can erode&#13;
civil service institutional capacity over the medium and long term.&#13;
52.   The project will finance specialized technical support in procurement, financial&#13;
management, and other areas as needed. In additicn, to ensure that project funds are used&#13;
for the purposes intended and to help carry out project supervision, the World Bank will&#13;
employ two independent firms as Fiduciary and Safeguards Monitoring Agents.&#13;
53.   As a further compensating control, disbursements will be made primarily by&#13;
direct payment by the Bank to the contractors, consultants, and vendors. Once authorized&#13;
by the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR), direct payments will be made by the&#13;
World Bank directly into the account of the contractor, consultant, or vendor in a&#13;
commercial bank capable of receiving funds transferred from the international banking&#13;
system.&#13;
54.   The project management component and payments below the threshold of&#13;
$10,000 normally will be made through payments by the Recipient from its own&#13;
resources. These payments made from the Recipient's own resources will be reimbursed,&#13;
on a periodic basis, by the World Bank to the MOWR upon presentation of relevant&#13;
supporting documents, proof of payment, and a signed withdrawal application. The PMT&#13;
and the main financial counterparts from the MOWR will be subject to intensive training&#13;
in the Bank's disbursement procedures.&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
55.   Bank policies require that Grant proceeds be used only for the purposes for which&#13;
they were granted, with due regard to economy and efficiency, and the sustainable&#13;
achievement of the project's development objectives. The Recipient, MOWR, is required&#13;
in this regard to cause the PMT to maintain an appropriate and adequate financial&#13;
management system, including records and accounts, and prepare financial statements&#13;
18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
adequate to separately reflect the operations, resources, and expenditures of the project.&#13;
The grant Agreement also commits the recipient to have financial statements of the&#13;
project audited for each fiscal year by a qualified auditor acceptable to the Bank&#13;
following internationally accepted standards.&#13;
Financial Management Risk Assessment&#13;
56.   The financial management risk associated with this operation is considered high.&#13;
Critical risk factors are: (i) ongoing insecurity, which prevents on-site Bank supervision&#13;
and assessments, including financial management assessments; (ii) the Bank's limited&#13;
knowledge of Iraq's public financial management systems, controls, and procedures; (iii)&#13;
the limited knowledge on the part of Iraqi authorities of Bank policies and guidelines; (iv)&#13;
MOWR making available on a timely basis financial resources to honor payments below&#13;
the value of $10,000; (v) difficult communication and flow of information between&#13;
worksites and the PMT, which could delay payments; (vi) inefficiencies in Iraq's banking&#13;
system that delay payments and transfer of funds to contractors, suppliers, or MOWR;&#13;
and (vii) variation orders that may exceed price contingencies and difficulty may be&#13;
encountered in verifying justification for variation orders. Although the project design&#13;
mitigates to the extent possible these risks, the project will require close monitoring and&#13;
supervision during implementation.&#13;
57.   Additional risk arises from the fact that only part of sub-projects have been&#13;
identified- total amount of US$2.5 million out of the allocated US$10 million. These sub-&#13;
projects should be identified and assessed for eligibility according to the set criteria and&#13;
yet implemented within the two years project period. In addition, the new sub-projects&#13;
may be in remote areas which may further delay the implementation process. A detailed&#13;
financial management risk assessment is in Annex 6.&#13;
58.   The control risks will be mitigated by putting in place additional controls and&#13;
procedures including: (a) the PMT will verify and authorize payments under the project&#13;
and verify justification for variation orders; (b) the PMT will maintain accounting system&#13;
for the project and retain project's records and supporting documents; (c) a qualified&#13;
financial manager will be appointed for the PMT financed under the Grant, and the PMT&#13;
will be assigned a competent financial officer and finance assistant from MOWR who&#13;
will be supported by a financial management consultant; (d) the Minister will designate&#13;
an internal auditor from the internal audit department of MOWR to track and verify the&#13;
project financial transactions; (e) disbursements by the Bank will be made primarily by&#13;
direct payments and on reimbursement basis supported by full documentation; (f) the&#13;
Fiduciary Monitoring Agent will review project expenditures and Withdrawal&#13;
Applications; (g) the internal audit department at MOWR will maintain ledger account&#13;
for each contract to track all payments made against each contract and avoid&#13;
overpayment; and (h) close control will be exercised on all project documents and&#13;
payment supporting documents at the PMT.&#13;
59.   The accounting and reporting risks will be managed by putting in place a simple&#13;
computerized system using spreadsheet applications, capable of recording all project&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
expenditures, tracking project commitments in real time during the implementation&#13;
period, and providing the data needed for the generation of project reports, including the&#13;
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR).&#13;
60.   An external independent auditor with international experience will be engaged to&#13;
perform the project audits and issue an independent opinion on the project financial&#13;
statements. The external audit report will encompass all project activities and will be in&#13;
accordance with internationally accepted auditing standards. The audit report along with&#13;
the related financial statements should be submitted to the Bank not later than six months&#13;
after the end of each of the project fiscal years.&#13;
61.   All the above activities and procedures will be documented within a chapter of the&#13;
project implementation plan, which will be line with the Master Implementation Manual.&#13;
F.    MONITORING, REPORTING AND AUDITING&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation System&#13;
62.   As the project team had limited access to data in Iraq, and was also constrained by&#13;
the travel restrictions, the project design has envisaged a programmatic learning-by-doing&#13;
approach. The first phase of project implementation will finance subprojects that fulfill&#13;
the project appraisal criteria agreed with the Iraqi delegation at negotiations. These&#13;
subprojects will be reviewed by the Bank's consultant for the project (already procured)&#13;
and by the project task team. With improved access to information during project&#13;
implementation, key elements of the appraisal criteria will be reviewed and modified if&#13;
necessary during supervision missions.&#13;
63.   The key outputs/outcomes monitored will be the following:&#13;
* Improved, sustainable services from rehabilitated water infrastructure (for rural&#13;
water supply, sanitation, irrigation and drainage services);&#13;
* Generation of employment and income by project activities;&#13;
* Availability of adequate pipeline of financeable subprojects through completed&#13;
feasibility studies, preliminary design and bidding documents;&#13;
* Community ownership of subprojects, to the extent possible under the&#13;
circumstances; and&#13;
* Due regard to environmental sustainability.&#13;
64.   The key performance indicators to measure outputs/outcomes related to project&#13;
milestones are:&#13;
1.    Economic Viability and Financial Sustainability&#13;
20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(a)   Unit cost per hectare (for irrigation and drainage subprojects).&#13;
(b)   Unit cost per consumer (for rural water supply subprojects).&#13;
(c)   Percentage of secured/recovered operation and maintenance costs.&#13;
2.    Reliability and Efficiency&#13;
(a)   Interruptions to service.&#13;
(b)   User satisfaction through independent surveys.&#13;
(c)   Irrigation conveyance/distribution and use (or application) efficiencies.&#13;
3.    Job Creation/Income&#13;
(a)   Incremental employment generated by the project.&#13;
(b)   Growth in income attributed to the project.&#13;
4.    Project Pipeline&#13;
(a)   Number of subprojects with completed feasibility studies and bidding&#13;
documents.&#13;
(b)   Improved project cycle procedures and efficient project-cycle timeline.&#13;
5.    Community Participation&#13;
(a)   Level of organization of the community to mobilize and undertake specific&#13;
subproject activities.&#13;
(c)   Contributions of community (leaders) through labor, cash and materials to&#13;
the subprojects.&#13;
6.    Environmental Sustainability&#13;
(a)   Reduction in water logged acreage.&#13;
(b)   Reduction in water and soil salinity concentration in particles per million.&#13;
65.   The key input indicators will be monitored through a Management Information&#13;
System (MIS) that will monitor the progress in project processing, procurement actions&#13;
and financial management. Through the MIS, Monitoring and Evaluation functions will&#13;
be performed by the PMT and PMT-hired TA consultants, thus providing the inputs&#13;
needed (see table below) for the World Bank Consultant Team to undertake effective&#13;
supervision. Performance indicators agreed with the Iraqi delegation during technical&#13;
discussions will form the basis of monitoring project implementation. During the project&#13;
preparation phase the baseline data will be obtained. The Iraqi consultant teams from the&#13;
PMT and PMT-hired TA consultants will be provided with digital video-recorders, so&#13;
that community consultation processes can be monitored by the TA consultants and Bank&#13;
staff/consultants.&#13;
The framework for output monitoring would be as follows:&#13;

Reporting Requirements&#13;
66.   The following arrangements were agreed at negotiations:&#13;
(i)   Monthly Statements&#13;
The MOWR/PMT will be responsible for maintaining control of accounting information&#13;
and keeping all supporting documentation required by normal accounting practices for&#13;
payments. The Project Coordinator will prepare monthly financial information on: (i) the&#13;
amount of resources disbursed to rehabilitation subprojects or feasibility studies; (ii)&#13;
incremental operating costs; and (iii) status of replenishment and resources remaining for&#13;
upcoming activities.&#13;
(ii)  Monthly and Quarterly Report&#13;
The PMT will prepare monthly reports on each rehabilitation subproject and feasibility&#13;
study for the first six months of project effectiveness, and thereafter Quarterly Reports.&#13;
Such reports will be submitted to the MOWR and the World Bank no later than two&#13;
weeks after the end of the respective month or quarter. The reports will contain a&#13;
summary of activities, progress made since previous reports, problems encountered, and&#13;
steps taken to overcome difficulties, and information related to key monitoring indicators.&#13;
Key features of the report are provided in Section V of Annex 6.&#13;
Reuortins To Donors&#13;
The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the fands&#13;
deposited by the donors with the Bank under the ITF. Within ninety (90) days of the end&#13;
of each quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31), the Bank will&#13;
prepare, on a cash basis, an unaudited statements of receipts, disbursements, and fund&#13;
balance with respect to the ITF and forward a copy to each donor. Each such statement&#13;
will be expressed in United States Dollars, the currency in which the ITF funds will be&#13;
maintained by the Bank. In addition, within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the&#13;
completion of all disbursements relating to activities financed from the ITF, the Bank will&#13;
prepare on a cash basis an unaudited financial statement of receipts, disbursements, and&#13;
fund balance with respect to the ITF and forward a copy to each donor.&#13;
The Bank will furnish to the donors:&#13;
a.    On a semi-annual basis, a consolidated report describing the operations of&#13;
the ITF (including contributions, disbursements, and implementation&#13;
progress) in the preceding six months; and&#13;
b.    On an annual basis, a management assertion, together with an attestation&#13;
from the Bank's external auditors, concerning the adequacy of internal&#13;
control over cash-based financial reporting for trust funds as a whole.&#13;
24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Auditing&#13;
67.   The project will have three types of audits: Financial Audit, Technical Review,&#13;
and Procurement Audit. At least one independent financial audit will be conducted&#13;
annually by qualified independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, within six months of&#13;
the closing of accounts. Technical reviews will be performed regularly in accordance&#13;
with agreed terms of reference.&#13;
25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
G.     RISKS&#13;
68.    This project is being undertaken in an uncertain and risky environment. The table&#13;
below summarizes the key project risks identified and indicates measures which are being&#13;
taken to mitigate these risks. The major risk for the project is the inability of the MOWR&#13;
to complete the rehabilitation activities on time because of security issues. Additional&#13;
risks for financial management issues are detailed in Annex 6. The project has also been&#13;
rated as Category B and therefore safeguard measures have been put in place (see&#13;
Working Papers for the environmental and social screening and assessment framework).&#13;
RISK                     RATING             MITIGATION MEASURES&#13;

At the time of project appraisal, information was available for only five subprojects listed&#13;
below. Additional subprojects will be identified and prepared in compliance with the&#13;
eligibility criteria detailed in the Operations Manual. By design, no subproject should&#13;
exceed US$1,000,000 equivalent, therefore no ICB contracts are anticipated at this time.&#13;
Goods and works not exceeding US$50,000 equivalent per contract may be procured&#13;
under contracts awarded on the basis of Shopping. This method is based on the&#13;
comparison of price quotations obtained from several suppliers (for goods) or from&#13;
several contractors (for works), with a minimum of three, to assure competitive prices, as&#13;
detailed in Para 3.5 of the Guidelines.&#13;

Annex 6&#13;
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
I.    Summary&#13;
Under the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund, the MOWR, as the implementing agency, is the&#13;
Grant Recipient. The Grant financial resources will be managed by the MOWR within&#13;
the framework of the MOWR financial management system and additional World Bank&#13;
procurement and financial management procedures. The Grant funds will be made&#13;
available to the MOWR who will enter into contractual agreements with contractors,&#13;
consultants and suppliers for the rehabilitation and construction of activities financed&#13;
under the project.&#13;
In view of the current security situation it has not been possible for WB staff to travel to&#13;
Iraq. In lieu of this, the MOWR financial management assessment was carried out by a&#13;
regional consulting firm. The assessment covered the current financial management&#13;
system at the MOWR in order to identify the risks associated with the control&#13;
environment, the accounting, reporting and auditing procedures in place and proposed&#13;
actions to reduce and manage such risks. This assessment showed that the systems in&#13;
place at MOWR are based on principles and procedures defined by the legal framework&#13;
and operational decrees applicable to the public sector in Iraq. These procedures prepare&#13;
reports based on budget line expenditures and include several layers of routine&#13;
authorization controls. The assessment described the organization structure of the&#13;
MOWR, the accounting system used, reporting, the internal control procedures, and&#13;
payments control mechanisms. The assessment showed various weaknesses in the control&#13;
system and control environment'. Accordingly, the Bank will introduce additional control&#13;
measures to the project.- The financial management assessment project files include a&#13;
copy of the assessment documentation.&#13;
H.    Financial Management Risk Assessment&#13;
The financial management risk associated with this operation is considered high. Critical&#13;
risk factors are: (i) ongoing insecurity, which prevents on-site Bank supervision and&#13;
assessments, including financial management assessments; (ii) the Bank's limited&#13;
knowledge of Iraq's public financial management systems, controls, and procedures; (iii)&#13;
the limited knowledge on the part of Iraqi authorities of Bank policies and guidelines;&#13;
(iv) the possibility of MOWR not making available on a timely basis financial resources&#13;
to honor payments below the value of $10,000; (v) difficult communication and flow of&#13;
information between worksites and the PMT due to large number of areas, which could&#13;
delay payments; (vi) inefficiencies in Iraq's banking system that delay payments and&#13;
transfer of funds to contractors, suppliers, or MOVWR; (vii) variation orders that may&#13;
exceed price contingencies and difficulty may be encountered in verifying justification&#13;
for variation orders, and (viii) . Although the project design mitigates to the extent&#13;
1 Special purpose audit on five ministries conducted by qualified audit firm revealed several irregular&#13;
transactions and breaches of the control system of those ministries.&#13;
40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
possible these risks, the project will require close monitoring and supervision during&#13;
implementation. A detailed risk assessment is in Section VII.&#13;
III. Risk Mitigation Measures&#13;
The overall high risk will be partially mitigated by putting in place additional controls&#13;
and procedures.&#13;
The control risk will be partially mitigated by putting in place additional controls and&#13;
procedures, including: (a) the PMT will verify and authorize payments under the project&#13;
and will verify justification for variation orders; (b) the PMT will maintain accounting&#13;
system for the project and retain project's records and supporting documents, (c) a&#13;
qualified financial manager will be appointed for the PMT financed under the Grant, and&#13;
the PMT will be assigned a competent financial officer and finance assistant from&#13;
MOWR who will be supported by a financial management consultant; (d) the Minister&#13;
will designate an internal auditor from the internal audit department of MOWR to track&#13;
and verify the project financial transactions; (e) disbursements by the Bank will be made&#13;
primarily by direct payments and on reimbursement basis supported by full&#13;
documentation; (f) the Fiduciary Monitoring Agent will review project expenditures and&#13;
Withdrawal Applications; (g) the internal audit department at MOWR will maintain&#13;
ledger account for each contract to track all payments made against each contract and&#13;
avoid overpayment; and (h) close control will be exercised on all project documents and&#13;
payment supporting documents at the PMT.&#13;
The accounting and reporting risks will be managed by putting in place a simple&#13;
computerized system using spreadsheet applications, capable of recording all project&#13;
expenditures, tracking project commitments in real time during the implementation&#13;
period, and providing the data needed for the generation of project reports, including the&#13;
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR).&#13;
All the above activities and procedures will be documented in a chapter of the project&#13;
implementation plan and will be in line with the Master Implementation Manual&#13;
IV.   Financial Management Arrangements.&#13;
Flow of Information. As per current control regulations all invoices, or work orders will&#13;
be signed and approved by the local technical implementation units in the districts and&#13;
will be remitted to PMT for payment under cover letter signed by the manager of the unit.&#13;
Contracting and payment processes will be centralized at the PMT level. The PMT will&#13;
verify all claims and will maintain up-to-date invoices register and general ledger to&#13;
record all payments incurred. The MOWR internal auditor designated to the project by&#13;
the Minister will perform ex-ante checking to all financial transactions.&#13;
Financial Management Procedures. The project procedures and the parallel accounting&#13;
system that are managed by the PMT will be detailed in the project implementation plan&#13;
in order to define the relation between all stakeholders involved with the project&#13;
implementation and facilitate the flow of project information.&#13;
41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
V.    Project Reports&#13;
Project reports should be remitted to the Bank following the agreed format and&#13;
frequency. The proposed format of the reports is in the project files and was agreed upon&#13;
with the MOWR representatives during negotiations.&#13;
Ouarterly Reports: The MOWR will generate Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) and&#13;
submit them to the Bank as part of the project progress report, or separately, within 45&#13;
days from the end of the quarter. These FMRs include two sections:&#13;
* Financial Reports will include a cash flow statement, beginning and ending&#13;
project cash balances and an expenditure report by activity or contract comparing&#13;
actual and planned expenditures. Also, a narrative report explaining major&#13;
variances when compared to plan and the proposed corrective actions should be&#13;
included as an annex to the financial reports.&#13;
* Contracts Reports will include information on the major rehabilitation and&#13;
construction contracts, showing contract financial status against plan, including&#13;
information on all authorized contract variations.&#13;
These reports should be remitted to the Bank within 45 days from the end of the period.&#13;
The proposed format of the reports is in the project files and will be agreed upon with the&#13;
MOWR representatives during negotiations.&#13;
Annual Reports: Audited Project Financial Statements that will be submitted to the Bank&#13;
no later than six months after the end of the fiscal year, include:&#13;
1. Statement of sources and utilization of funds, indicating funds received and&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
2. Appropriate schedules classifying project activities, showing cumulative balances.&#13;
3. Statement of payments made using SOEs procedures, if allowed later by the&#13;
Bank, as defined in the legal agreement.&#13;
ReDortiniE To Donors: The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger accounts in&#13;
respect of the funds deposited by the donors with the Bank under the ITF. Within ninety&#13;
(90) days of the end of each quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30, and December&#13;
31), the Bank will prepare, on a cash basis, an unaudited statements of receipts,&#13;
disbursements, and fund balance with respect to the ITF and forward a copy to each&#13;
donor. Each such statement will be expressed in United States Dollars, the currency in&#13;
which the ITF funds will be maintained by the Bank. In addition, within one hundred and&#13;
eighty (180) days of the completion of all disbursements relating to activities financed&#13;
from the ITF, the Bank will prepare on a cash basis an unaudited financial statement of&#13;
receipts, disbursements, and fund balance with respect to the ITF and forward a copy to&#13;
each donor.&#13;
The Bank will furnish to the donors:&#13;
a.    On a semi-annual basis, a consolidated report describing the operations of&#13;
the ITF (including contributions, disbursements, and implementation&#13;
progress) in the preceding six months; and&#13;
42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
b.    On an annual basis, a management assertion, together with an attestation&#13;
from the Bank's external auditors, concerning the adequacy of internal&#13;
control over cash-based financial reporting for trust funds as a whole.&#13;
VI.   Auditing Arrangements&#13;
An external independent auditor with international experience will be engaged to perform&#13;
the project audit and issue an independent opinion on the project financial statements.&#13;
The external audit report will encompass all of the Project's activities and will be&#13;
presented in accordance with internationally accepted auditing standards. MOWR will&#13;
remit a project audit report to the Bank not later than six months after year end. The&#13;
auditor selection process will be launched directly after the Grant Agreement is signed. In&#13;
addition to the audit reports, the auditor will prepare a "management letter" identifying&#13;
any observations, comments, and deficiencies in the system and controls that the auditor&#13;
considers pertinent, and will provide recommendations for their improvements. The audit&#13;
will cover the expenditures made through direct payments as well as expenditures&#13;
reimbursed to the MOWR in terms of their substantiation and their eligibility and&#13;
compliance with the Grant Agreement. An escrow account will be used to pay the&#13;
auditor after the project closing date.&#13;
VII. Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
The Grant of US$20 million is expected to be disbursed within two years period. The&#13;
Bank's strategy in Iraq is to ensure Iraqi ownership and strengthen institutional capacity&#13;
by financing operations that are implemented by Iraqi ministries and other recipient&#13;
entities. Trained PMTs will facilitate implementation and help ensure compliance with&#13;
fiduciary and other safeguards. PMTs will be employed and paid by the implementing&#13;
entity at regular salary levels, thereby avoiding the disadvantages of stand-alone Project&#13;
Implementation Units that can erode civil service institutional capacity over the medium&#13;
and long term. The project will finance specialized technical support in procurement,&#13;
financial management, and other areas as needed. In addition, to ensure that project&#13;
funds are used for the purposes intended and to help carry out project supervision, the&#13;
World Bank will employ two independent firms as fiduciary and safeguard Monitoring&#13;
Agents.&#13;
As a further compensating control, disbursements will be made primarily by direct&#13;
payment by the Bank to the contractors, consultants, and vendors. Once authorized by&#13;
the MOWR, direct payments will be made by the World Bank directly into the account of&#13;
the contractor, consultant, or vendor in a commercial bank capable of receiving funds&#13;
transferred from the international banking system.&#13;
The project management component costs and payments below the threshold of&#13;
US$10,000 normally will be made through payments by the Recipient from its own&#13;
resources. These payments made from the Recipient's own resources will be reimbursed,&#13;
on a periodic basis, by the World Bank to the MOWR upon presentation of supporting&#13;
documents, proof of payment, and a signed withdrawal applications. The PMT and the&#13;
main financial counterparts from the MOWR will be subject to intensive training in the&#13;
Bank's disbursement procedures.&#13;
43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Use of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Initially supporting documentation will be&#13;
provided to the Bank for all requests to disburse funds under the Grant. The Bank has the&#13;
option to allow expenditures under US$10,000 to be made by means of Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs). If SOEs are allowed the supporting documentation will be&#13;
maintained at the PMT of MOWR and made available for review by Bank representatives&#13;
upon request; any documentation relating to SOEs will be retained for up to one year&#13;
from the date the Bank receives the second Grant audit report.&#13;
VIII. Financial Management Risk Assessment:&#13;
The following table summarizes the identified risks, the risk assessment, and mitigation&#13;
measures:&#13;
Identified Risks                            Risk     Mitigation Measures&#13;
Rating    MiiainMaue&#13;
The Bank gained some knowledge on Iraqi&#13;
Public Financial Management (PFM) by&#13;
appointing a consulting firm to assess&#13;
Limited knowledge of the Iraqi financial     H       several Iraqi ministries. Bank staff also&#13;
management systems, and capacity                     conducted their own interviews with Iraqi&#13;
officials in Amman and reviewed PFM&#13;
system documentation. Further knowledge&#13;
was gained from an audit report issued by&#13;
an intemational audit firm&#13;
The PMT will staff will include a qualified&#13;
financial manager, assisted by a financial&#13;
officer, and a finance assistant. The&#13;
financial manager will manage&#13;
disbursements from the proceeds of the&#13;
grants, supervise project accounts, retain&#13;
Limited Financial Management (FM) capacity   H       financial records, and prepare project&#13;
of MOWR, to comply with FM requirements.            reports. The team will be assisted by a FM&#13;
consultant. The Bank also engaged a&#13;
consulting firm to prepare a Master&#13;
Implementation Manual to be used by all&#13;
projects financed under the Iraq Trust&#13;
Fund.&#13;
MOWR already started communications&#13;
Unidentified sub-projects which may delay            with local councils to identify new sub-&#13;
project implementation. Also, some newly             projects based on the approved eligibility&#13;
identified sub-projects may be in remote areas  H    criteria. PMT will arrange through the&#13;
which may cause communication with and               MOWR directorates in the governorates to&#13;
supervision by the PMT and Monitoring               review and supervise sub-projects. Also,&#13;
Agents very difficult                                the monitoring agents will assist as&#13;
feasible.&#13;
The Iraqi contribution to the project will be&#13;
Counterpart Funds not nmade available        L       in kind, i.e. the costs of staff assigned to&#13;
the PMT and staff from   the ministry&#13;
working on the project.&#13;
The MOWR not being able to provide funds             The ministry commitment to provide the&#13;
from its own resources for transaction below  H      required funds was confirmed during&#13;
US$ 10 000                              I            negotiations.&#13;
44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The flow of funds will concentrate on using&#13;
direct payment; however inefficiencies in&#13;
the banking and payment system in Iraq&#13;
remain a major risk factor for such&#13;
Funds flow not taking place as planned      H      payments. The Bank uses Wachovia for&#13;
US$ payment in Iraq. Also the Bank&#13;
discussed with Citi Bank and Standard&#13;
Chartered their abilities to transfer funds&#13;
into Iraqi Banks&#13;
Once the Master Implementation Manual&#13;
and the project implementation plan have&#13;
Accounting Policies and procedures not meeting  M   been  finalized, well-defined  financial&#13;
the Bank minimum requirement                        policies and procedures will be in place. In&#13;
addition, the financial management policies&#13;
of the MMWP will apply to the project.&#13;
The Minister will designate an auditor from&#13;
the internal audit department to perform&#13;
ex-ante verification on the project financial&#13;
Internal Audit not taking place             M      transactions. The internal auditor will be&#13;

VIII. Project Supervision&#13;
The project will be implemented in close coordination with the World Bank Consultant&#13;
Team, who will be responsible for monitoring compliance with Bank safeguards and&#13;
procedures. The consultant team will assist during the project launch workshop and also&#13;
provide the needed training to the PMT and the MOWR staff. The project will be&#13;
supervised by the World Bank on a quarterly basis in the first year, and every six months&#13;
thereafter. World Bank supervision missions will consist of visits to the MOWR, MOF,&#13;
MOPDC, and rehabilitation sites, and would review the impact of the project activities&#13;
and related documentation. Should security conditions not permit access of Bank staff&#13;
and consultants the World Bank Consultant Team will conduct the supervision on behalf&#13;
of the Bank. The Bank will also appoint independent fiduciary and safeguard Monitoring&#13;
Agents, who will oversee the overall project implementation to ensure full compliance&#13;
with the Trust Fund covenants.&#13;

            The Emergency Community Infrastructure
            Rehabilitation Project for Iraq addresses current emergency
            needs for infrastructure rehabilitation at the community
            level and generates employment. This will cover the
            restoration of rural infrastructure using labor-intensive,
            small-scale civil works programs for water supply,
            sanitation, irrigation, and drainage infrastructure
            sub-projects. The project will identify and implement small
            water development sub-projects that are based on immediate
            infrastructure rehabilitation needs and priorities of
            communities, particularly those located in low-income areas.
            A first set of four subprojects has been identified and
            submitted to the Bank, and ten other sub-projects are being
            processed by the Ministry of Water Resources.
