THE HUNGARIAN ECONOMIC REFORM, 1968-81&#13;
This paper reviews the Hungarian experience with the economic reform (in&#13;
official parlance, the new economic mechanism) introduced on January 1,&#13;
1968. It draws on the author's earlier writings on the Hungarian reform, with&#13;
the addition of new material on agriculture, on the 'second economy,' and on&#13;
the policy measures introduced in 1980 and in 1981.&#13;
Following a short description of the antecedents of the reform, the paper&#13;
analyses the reform measures introduced in 1968 concerning agriculture,&#13;
decision-making by industrial firms, price determination, the exchange rate,&#13;
export subsidies, import protection, and investment decisions, further&#13;
indicating their effects on the Hungarian economy. Next, the tendencies&#13;
towards re-centralization after 1971 and, in particular, after the external&#13;
shocks of 1973 are examined, with consideration given to their economic&#13;
effects. The reversal of these tendencies in 1980 and 1981, and the role of&#13;
agriculture and of the 'second economy' in Hungary, are the subject of the&#13;
concluding sections of the paper.&#13;

THE HUNGARIAN ECONOMIC REFORM, 1968-81&#13;
Bela Balassa&#13;
This paper reviews the Hungarian experience with the economic reform (in&#13;
official parlance, the new economic mechanism) introduced on January 1,&#13;
1968. It draws on the author's earlier writings on the Hungarian reform&#13;
(Balassa, 1970, 1973, and 1978),l/ with the addition of new material on the&#13;
economic effects of the policies followed between 1974 and 1979, on the policy&#13;
measures introduced in 1980 and in 1981, on agriculture, and on the 'second&#13;
economy' that were not covered in the earlier papers.&#13;
Section I describes the antecedents of the reform. Section II analyses&#13;
the principal reform measures introduced in 1968 while Section III reports on&#13;
economic performance under the reform. In turn, Section IV examines the&#13;
tendencies towards re-centralization after 1972 and Section V indicates the&#13;
economic effects of the policies applied. The renewal of the reform efforts&#13;
in 1980 and 1981 is the subject of Section VI whereas Section VII examines the&#13;
role of agriculture and of the 'second economy' in Hungary.&#13;
I. The Antecedents of the Economic Reform&#13;
Along with other Eastern European countries, after the Second World War&#13;
Hungary adopted with few modifications the system of centralized planning&#13;
practiced in the Soviet Union. 2/ Planning was largely carried out in&#13;
physical terms, with prices having mainly an accounting function. Decisions&#13;
on investment and on foreign trade were made centrally and central plans&#13;
served as a basis for the directives communicated by the supervising&#13;
1/ The reader is referred to these papers for source material utilized in&#13;

ministries to individual firms. The directives concerned, among others,&#13;
output targets, material allocation, wages, and employment. Within the&#13;
constraints imposed by the allocation of inputs, managers aimed at fulfilling&#13;
the production plan that was the principal success criterion and the condition&#13;
for obtaining bonuses.&#13;
In permitting the large-scale mobilization of resources, the system of&#13;
centralized  physical planning   was conducive to economic growth in Hungary&#13;
during the early postwar period when a limited number of objectives were&#13;
pursued. With the multiplicity of objectives and the growing complexity of&#13;
manufacturing industry, however, the disadvantages of this system of planning&#13;
assumed importance.&#13;
To begin with, in pursuing production targets, managers paid little&#13;
attention to costs and often tried to increase output through shifts in&#13;
product composition towards material-intensive commodities, disguised price&#13;
increases, and quality deterioration. In turn, users had practically no&#13;
choice among suppliers and had to accept commodities that did not correspond&#13;
to their needs.&#13;
The introduction of profits as a supplementary success criterion and&#13;
condition for bonuses did not lessen these adverse effects to an appreciable&#13;
extent. The basic features of centralized physical planning remained&#13;
unchanged and, in the absence of scarcity prices reflecting resource&#13;
scarcities, profits could not provide appropriate signals for the firm.&#13;
Prices did not include an allowance for the use of capital and land; they not&#13;
equate domestic demand and supply; and they were divorced from world market&#13;
price relations. Exporters received, and importers paid, the prices set&#13;
domestically; the difference between domestic and world market prices was paid&#13;
into, and financed from, an equalisation fund in the government budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
Nor did the lack of scarcity prices permit the economic evaluation of&#13;
investment projects and the appropriate choice of exports and imports.&#13;
Correspondingly, additional increments in domestic consumption required&#13;
increased efforts in the form of resources used for new investments and&#13;
imports and the rate of economic growth declined. According to official&#13;
figures, the rate of growth of the net material product was 7.9 percent in&#13;
1958-60, 5.6 percent in 1960-63, and 4.3 percent in 1963-66. In the period&#13;
taken as a whole, the volume of investment increased by 7.7 percent a year&#13;
while total consumption (public and private) rose by 4.6 percent, and the net&#13;
material product by 6.2 percent. 1/&#13;
A proposal for a comprehensive reform was first made by a committee&#13;
appointecd by the government and headed by Professor Stephen Varga in 1957.&#13;
The recommendations of the committee were not implemented, however, and in the&#13;
following decade only partial measures were taken that did not affect the&#13;
basic character of the decision-making process.2/&#13;
At the same time, the need for a comprehensive, rather than a piecemeal,&#13;
reform came to be increasingly understood. The increased sophistication of&#13;
the Hungarian economy and its extensive reliance on foreign trade, by reason&#13;
of the small size of the domestic market and the limited availability of&#13;
natural resources, favored the decentralization of decision-making. But,&#13;

originate from the Statistical Yearbook and the Foreign Trade Statistical&#13;
Yearbook, both published by the Hungarian Statistical Office. The former&#13;
publicatLon is available in Hungarian and English; the latter in Hungarian&#13;
only.&#13;
2/  As discussed below agriculture provides an exception to this statement --&#13;
an excellent discussion of the reform proposals and the surrounding&#13;
controversy is provided by Berend, 1981.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
decentralization could not provide appropriate results in the absence of&#13;
profit incentives based on scarcity prices.&#13;
A comprehensive economic reform (the new economic mechanism) was&#13;
introduced on January 1, 1968. The reform aimed at replacing plan directives&#13;
by market relations among firms; limiting the scope of central price&#13;
determination; linking the domestic prices of exports and imports to prices in&#13;
the world market; and decentralizing a major part of investment decisions.&#13;
At the time of the reform's introduction, a variety of 'brakes' were&#13;
applied for the ostensible purpose of easing the transition from the old&#13;
mechanism to the new, although in some respects they reflected compromises&#13;
between the supporters of tihe two. The following section will briefly&#13;
describe the principal featuies of the reform at the time of its introduction,&#13;
indicating further some of the changes effected in the first years of its&#13;
application.&#13;
II. The Introduction of the New Economic Mechanism&#13;
As noted above, the reform in agriculture antedates the general economic&#13;
reform in Hungary. Starting in the late fifties, obligatory plan targets and&#13;
compulsory deliveries were abolished and the prices of agricultural products&#13;
raised, with a number of products being sold in farm markets at freely&#13;
determined prices. These reforms were supplemented by additional actions in&#13;
1968. To begin with, the rural co-operatives were provided with the legal and&#13;
financial basis necessary for their operations. Also, limitations on&#13;
livestock kept on household plots owned by co-operative, state farm,&#13;
industrial and other workers were eliminated and a generally supportive&#13;
attitude was taken in regard to cultivation on these plots. Finally, the&#13;
establishment of ancillary activities, including construction and local&#13;
manufacturing, by the agricultural co-operatives was encouraged.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
Changes in the role of industrial firms under the new economic mechanism&#13;
were stated concisely in the resolution of the Central Committee of the&#13;
Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party of May 7, 1966, which is the basic document&#13;
of the introductLon of the economic reform:&#13;
The development of an active role for the market requires that the&#13;
laborious and bureaucratic system of the centralized allocation of&#13;
materials and products...should give place to commercial relations, i.e.&#13;
--producers should 'be able to decide, within their range of activities,&#13;
what and how much t'hey produce and offer for sale, as well as in what&#13;
quantity and from whom they purchase the necessary inputs...&#13;
--producers and users should be free to establish commercial or co-&#13;
operative relationships--sellers and buyers should be free to agree on&#13;
the conditions of sale and, within the limits of governmental price&#13;
determination, also on the prices;&#13;
--the buyers should be free to choose, within the limits dictated by the&#13;
national interest, 'between domestic goods and imports, and the sellers&#13;
between selling on domestic or on export markets.&#13;
The replacement of administrative directives by market discipline was to&#13;
be supplemented by according greater freedom to the firm to carry out new&#13;
investments and to hire labor. At the same time, profits were to become the&#13;
measure of the firm's success, as well as the source of incentive payments and&#13;
of funds for new investment.&#13;
There is evidence that managers responded to changes in the incentive&#13;
system. According to a sample survey conducted soon after the introduction of&#13;
the reform, the managers' objectives could be classified as follows:&#13;
increases in profits, 27 percent; increases in profits per worker, 15 percent;&#13;
increases in output, 13 percent; satisfaction of user needs, 23 percent;&#13;
utilization of capacity, 14 percent; utilization of the firm's labor force, 7&#13;
percent; other 1 percent.&#13;
It is apparent that production as a target lost its pre-eminence and that&#13;
increases in profits became the single major objective. Some of the other&#13;
objectives also bear on profits while repeated references to the satisfaction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
of user needs may reflect the importance of catering to demand by consumers&#13;
and other users under the new mechanism. Increases in profits also appear as&#13;
the principal objective in the short-term and medium-term plans prepared by&#13;
firms.&#13;
The emphasis on profits contrasts with the objective of raising the per&#13;
capita incomes of workers in the Yugoslav system of labor-managed firms. In&#13;
fact, the Hungarian authorities decided against the introduction of workers&#13;
management that appeared to have adverse effects in Yugoslavia by limiting the&#13;
growth of employment and of output in individual firms.&#13;
Nevertheless, the high rate of taxation of increments in average wages&#13;
interfered with profit maximization by favoring expansion through increases in&#13;
employment as against upgrading the labor force or rewarding wage-earners for&#13;
productivity improvements, both of which raised average wages. These&#13;
regulations were partially modified in subsequent years, when the wages fund&#13;
became the principal criterion for taxation in some industries.&#13;
Changes in the system of incentives in 1968 were accompanied by the&#13;
liberalization of prices. The' major principles of the price reform were again&#13;
indicated in the May 7, 1966 Party resolution. Having noted that pr.ices&#13;
should reflect the joint influences of the cost of production, valuation by&#13;
the market, and state preferences, the resolution stated:&#13;
Valuation by the market will have to find expression in prices so that,&#13;
on the one hand, the resulting differences in profitability should&#13;
influence the structure of production (supply) and, on the other, these&#13;
prices should help to reach market equilibrium through their effects on&#13;
increasing or reducing the quantity demanded. For this purpose, it&#13;
should be made possible in the new price system to determine market&#13;
prices over a wide area through the agreement of buyers and sellers.&#13;
Following the introduction of the reform, central price determination was&#13;
abolished for 12 percent of agricultural goods, 28 percent of domestically-&#13;
produced materials and semi-finished products, 78 percent of industrial end-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
products, and 23 percent of consumer goods and services. In turn, prices were&#13;
fixed centrally, or were subject to an upper limit, for 70 percent of the&#13;
products in the first two categories, 20 percent in the third, and 50 percent&#13;
in the fourth.  In the remainder of cases, prices were left free to fluctuate&#13;
within predetermined limits.&#13;
Changes in producer prices brought these nearer to a system of scarcity&#13;
prices. However, centrally fixed prices were equated to average rather than&#13;
marginal costs. This procedure gave rise to distortions, especially for&#13;
materials and for semi-manufactures, where a weighted average of domestic and&#13;
import prices was taken, since domestic costs and the cost of importing from&#13;
Western and from socialist countries often differed to a considerable&#13;
extent. As a rule, prices were lowest on material imports from socialist&#13;
countries, but the quantities available from these sources were limited under&#13;
long-term trade agreements.&#13;
In 1969 and 1970, the scope of price fixing was further reduced for&#13;
materials and for semi-manufactures, and it was practically eliminated for all&#13;
finishecl products. But the Materials and Price Board retained its veto power&#13;
over price increases on commodities accounting for about 5-10 percent of&#13;
industrial production, and the rise of prices was restrained by limitations on&#13;
the rate of profit in cases where price determination required the agreement&#13;
of the buyer and the seller.   Also, differences between producer and consumer&#13;
prices were maintained by the use of turnover taxes, albeit to a lesser degree&#13;
than beforehand.&#13;
The central allocation of materials was also dismantled in 1968, although&#13;
initially certain materials, semi-manufactures, and foodstuffs remained&#13;
subject to quotas in one form or another.   The scope of quota allocation was&#13;
reduced in the following year when value of the products subject to some kind&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
of quota limitation accounted for less than 5 percent of total sales. Apart&#13;
from meat, cereals, and fodder that were centrally allocated, there were in&#13;
1969 purchase quotas for 13 products, import quotas for 17 products (the two&#13;
groups in part overlapped), and sales quotas for P products. Moreover,&#13;
commercial monopolies handled the purchase or sale of 20 products.&#13;
Further liberalization occurred in 1970. The central allocation of&#13;
cereals and fodder was discontinued; the number of products to which purchase&#13;
quotas applied was reduced to 4 (iron ore, copper and copper products,&#13;
newsprint, and autobuses), and only 5 products (electric energy, passenger&#13;
automobiles, coking coal, fertilizers, and fodder) were subject to import&#13;
quotas. The scope of quota allocation was again reduced and, with the&#13;
exception of meat and scrap metal, commercial monopolies abolished in the&#13;
following years.&#13;
The May 7, 1966 Party resolution also noted the need to improve&#13;
efficiency in foreign trade:&#13;
The new economic mechanism should establish a close relationship between&#13;
internal and external markets.   It should increase the impact of    -&#13;
influences originating in foreign markets on domestic production, sale&#13;
and consumption, as well as on the structure of exports and imports. It&#13;
should reduce the excessive protection to domestic production, thereby&#13;
eliminating the complacency to which it gave rise.&#13;
The price reform should bring about the correspondence of domestic&#13;
prices with prices in foreign trade transactions. For this purpose a&#13;
conversion ratio should be determined on the base of the average&#13;
domestic cost of foreign exchange, independently of the gold content of&#13;
the forint.&#13;
Firms producing for export at a cost higher than the conversion ratio,&#13;
subsequently renamed commercial exchange rate,' were given export&#13;
subsidies. In 1968, about two-thirds of exporting firms received subsidies&#13;
averaging 29 percent in ruble trade and 33 percent in dollar trade. The&#13;
subsidies were given on a firm-by-firm basis, thus contributing to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
maintenance of production for exports in high-cost firms while firms that&#13;
received only the conversion ratio had limited incentives to expand their&#13;
exports. In turn, imports were subject to tariffs and, as noted above,&#13;
certain products were subject to import quotas. Tariffs were reduced in&#13;
subsequent years and the scope of import quotas also diminished.&#13;
Linking domestic prices to foreign prices through the conversion ratio&#13;
represented an important advance in the rationalization of the price structure&#13;
in Hungary. Nevertheless, with the use of export subsidies and import&#13;
protection, there were continuing differences between the domestic and foreign&#13;
prices of individual commodities. Furthermore, on the average, incentives to&#13;
import substitution exceeded incentives to export.&#13;
Public authorities retained decision-making power over infrastructural&#13;
and social investments and over manufacturing investments that increased&#13;
capacity by over 25 percent, necessitated substantial imports, or irnvolved the&#13;
establishment of new factories. Also, in cases where investment decisions&#13;
were made by the firms themselves, they often had to supplement their&#13;
financial resources by credits or by government funds.  Bank credits played a&#13;
particularly important role in agriculture.&#13;
The efficient allocation of resources in a decentralized framework Is&#13;
predicated on the existence of domestic and/or foreign competition. According&#13;
to a sample survey carried out soon after the introduction of the reform, 40&#13;
percent of the firms did not confront competition from domestic firms, 48&#13;
percent experienced some competition, and only 12 percent met strong&#13;
competition. Also, 46 percent of the respondents did not experience any&#13;
import competition, 37 percent felt the existence of some competition from&#13;
imports, and 17 percent had much foreign competition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
While there was often import competition in cases when domestic&#13;
competition was absent, and vice versa, the results point to the limitations&#13;
of competition in Hungary. In the small domestic market, this was brought&#13;
about by the consolidation of firms in the early sixties. As a result, the&#13;
degree of industrial concentration was substantially higher in Hungary than in&#13;
the countries of Western Europe. For example, there was only one firm each&#13;
engaged in processing poultry as well as in manufacturing sugar, chocolate&#13;
products, beer, cigarettes, vegetable oils, milk products, glass, and paper.&#13;
The limited extent of competition led to diametrically opposed&#13;
recommendations. There were those who proposed giving a greater role to the&#13;
supervisory ministries. These proposals were in turn criticized on the&#13;
grounds that they would represent a move towards re-centralization that would&#13;
conflict with the objectives of the new economic mechanism. Rather, it was&#13;
suggested that there was a need to promote competition. For this purpose,&#13;
some observers recommended breaking up all large trusts and firms while others&#13;
proposed that this be limited to horizontal trusts and firms where no&#13;
efficiency loss was involved. Again others emphasized the need for increased&#13;
foreign competition through the liberalization of imports arguing that, in a&#13;
number of industrial branches, Hungary's small domestic market does not afford&#13;
sufficient domestic competition.&#13;
III. Economic Performance under the Reform&#13;
Section II described the main features of the new economic mechanism in&#13;
Hungary and indicated some of the changes that occurred in the years&#13;
immediately following its introduction. On the whole, these changes involved&#13;
at least partially releasing the 'brakes and moving towards greater&#13;
decentralization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
Data for the period 1967-73 point to the success of the new economic&#13;
mechanism in Hungary.   The deceleration of economic growth was reversed, with&#13;
the net material product increasing at an average annual rate of 6.2 percent&#13;
between 1967 and 1973. Also, with improvements in the efficiency of&#13;
investment, the rate of growth of consumption (5.7 percent) was on:Ly slightly&#13;
less than that of the net material product.&#13;
Even greater improvements are shown if adjustment is made for changes in&#13;
both capital and labor inputs. Thus, according to an unpublished study&#13;
undertaken by Mgrton Tardos at the Hungarian Institute for Market Research,&#13;
the growth rate of total factor productivity in Hungary more than doubled&#13;
between 1962-67 and 1967-72. Also, national income figures indicate&#13;
reductions in inventory ratios as firms economized with the holdings of&#13;
stocks.&#13;
These results reflect- cost reductions on the firm level that were made in&#13;
response to profit incentives. There is further evidence - albeit fragmentary&#13;
and impressionistic - that firms came to react more rapidly to domestic and&#13;
foreign demand and made increased efforts to improve technology following the&#13;
reform.&#13;
Manufacturing industry led the expansion, with growth rates averaging 7&#13;
percent a year during the entire period. Favorable developments were shown&#13;
also in agriculture, where the growth rate of gross output nearly cloubled,&#13;
approaching 3 percent betwfeen 1967 and 1973. With population rising only 0.3&#13;
percent a year, food production per head grew at nearly the same rate.&#13;
An important factor contributing to the growth of the Hungarian economy&#13;
was the expansion of the volume of exports at a rate nearly double that of the&#13;
net material product between 1967 and 1973. The value of exports to developed&#13;
and developing market econories, including Yugoslavia, increased more than the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
average, raising their share in the total to 44 percent in 1973.&#13;
Hungary's export performance in market economies was much superior to&#13;
that of other socialist countries, the only exception being Romania whose oil&#13;
exports increased during this period. Thus, as reported in IJnited Nations&#13;
trade statistics, the dollar value of these exports rose at an average annual&#13;
rate of 24 percent between 1968 and 1973 in Hungary as against rates of growth&#13;
between 14 and 18 percent in the other socialist countries and 28 percent in&#13;
Romania.&#13;
IV. Tendencies Towards Recentralization&#13;
In the early seventies a certain degree of recentralization occurred and&#13;
measures were taken that reduced the incentive effects of prices and&#13;
profits. The November 1972 Party resolution called for limiting the extent of&#13;
profit sharing by managers for the sake of avoiding large income&#13;
inequalities. Also, certain limitations were imposed on the movement of&#13;
labor; investments by industrial firms came to be increasingly influenced by&#13;
state preferences; and there were more frequent interventions on the part of&#13;
the supervising ministries.&#13;
More importantly, policy responses to external shocks, in the form of the&#13;
inflationary 1972-73 world boom, the 1974-75 world recession, and the&#13;
deterioration of the terms of trade after 1973, led to reduced use of market&#13;
mechanisms and to increased central directions and interventions. This&#13;
occurred as the policy makers attempted to isolate the Hungarian economy from&#13;
the impact of outside events.&#13;
Market economies also experienced sizeable external shocks during the&#13;
1973-75 period. Outward-oriented economies responded to these shocks by&#13;
temporarily adopting deflationary policies in order to limit the deterioration&#13;
of their balance of payments. As a result, average GNP growth rates declined&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
to a considerable extent in Greece (1.2 percent in 1973-75), Japan (1.1&#13;
percent), and Taiwan (1.5 percent), although rapid increases in exports&#13;
permitted economic growth to resume sooner in Korea, with average increases in&#13;
GNP of 8.8 percent between 1973 and 1975.&#13;
By contrast, inward-oriented market economies, such as Brazil and Turkey,&#13;
relied largely on foreign loans to avoid reductions in growth rates (Balassa,&#13;
1981). In Hungary, too, the decision was made to maintain past rates of&#13;
economic growth.   Growth rates of the net material product averaged 6.0&#13;
percent between 1973 and 1975, with slightly lower increases in domestic&#13;
consumption (5.8 percent) and the rapid :rise of net investment (34.2 percent&#13;
in 1974 and 11.5 percent in 1975).   Correspondingly, the export surplus of&#13;
1973 gave rise to a deficit, particularly in convertible currency trade.1/&#13;
This, in turn, necessitated foreign borrowing, with Hungary's indebtedness in&#13;
convertible currencies more than doubling between.1973 and 1975 according to&#13;
unofficial estimates (Table 1).&#13;
About two-thirds of the increased deficit in convertible currency&#13;
trade reflected the deterioration of the terms of trade while the remainder&#13;
represented an acceleration in the growth of the volume of imports and a&#13;
decline in the rate of export expansion. Imports increased to provide for the&#13;
growth of domestic consumption, the stockpiling of raw materials, and the&#13;
rapidly rising investments that in part required foreign machinery. In turn,&#13;
the adverse effects of foreign, demand conditions on exports were aggravated by&#13;
the buoyancy of the domestic market, the unfavorable product composition of&#13;
Hungarian exports, and reductions in export incentives.&#13;

well as trade in convertible currencies with socialist countries, which latter&#13;
amounted to above 15 percent of the total in recent years.&#13;

Export incentives were reduced through the withdrawal of subsidies to&#13;
firms that made profits in exporting and the imposition of additional taxes on&#13;
what were considered  excess profits.    At the same time, compensation was&#13;
provided to firms that incurred losses in exporting. These changes&#13;
represented a return from the industry-by-industry to the firm-by-firm&#13;
determinatLon of export subsidies (taxes), increased the scope of&#13;
interventions by the supervising ministries, and led to considerable&#13;
bargaining between the ministries and the firms.&#13;
In turn, import subsidies were used to limit increases in the prices of&#13;
imported products. This was the case in particular for petroleum, the&#13;
domestic price of which was only one-third of the world market price in&#13;
1974. Yet, even though the Soviet Union, Hungary's main supplier, increased&#13;
prices only with a time lag, the marginal cost of petroleum for Hungary is the&#13;
world market price.&#13;
The described developments reflected the intention of the Hungarian&#13;
authorities to minimize the effects of foreign inflation on domestic prices.&#13;
Distinction needs to be made, however, between stability in the overall price&#13;
level and in relative prices. While the former objective can be pursued by&#13;
revaluing the currency, in Hungary reliance was largely based on export taxes&#13;
and on import subsidies, thereby introducing firm-by-firm and product-by-&#13;
product differences.&#13;
These differences meant that the structure of domestic producer prices&#13;
became increasingly isolated from world market prices. Also, for the sake of&#13;
limiting increases in consumer prices, the rise in domestic producer prices&#13;
was not fully transmitted to the consumption sphere, thereby exacerbating&#13;
distortions between producer and consumer prices. Correspondingly, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
usefulness of domestic prices as signals for decisions by consumers and by&#13;
producers was reduced.&#13;
In the presence of distortions between world market and domestic producer&#13;
prices as well as between domestic producer and consumer prices, consumers had&#13;
little incentive to adjust their consumption pattern to changes in world&#13;
market prices. This was the case especially in energy, the consumer price of&#13;
which was substantially lower than the producer price that itself was a&#13;
fraction of the world market price as noted above.&#13;
Nor was inducement provided to producers to save energy, so that an&#13;
energy intensive pattern of production was maintained in agriculture as well&#13;
as manufacturing. More generally, the use of import subsidies increased&#13;
demand for imported inputs on the,part of the firm. Also, notwithstanding the&#13;
introduction of taxes on excess profits, import-intensive exports were&#13;
encouraged since these taxes left domestic relative prices unchanged.&#13;
At the same time, the welter of taxes and subsidies on exports and on&#13;
imported inputs, designed to offset changes in world market prices,&#13;
discouraged adjustments in the export structure in response to changing&#13;
foreign price relations. Moreover, measures taken in a particular area gave&#13;
rise to measures in other areas in order to compensate for the effects of the&#13;
former.&#13;
Thus, production taxes, levied on a firm-by-firm basis, came into&#13;
increased use. Furthermore, the extent of central directions on the firms&#13;
product composition, and interventions on the part of supervisory ministries&#13;
in the day-to-day operation of the firms, increased. But, the firms&#13;
themselves turned to the supervising ministries for financial assistance in&#13;
cases when they deemed to have been adversely affected by the measures taken,&#13;
and production taxes and budgetary subsidies became the subject of bargaining.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
With lesser reliance on the price system, the scope of quantitative&#13;
regulations also increased. The number of products subject to purchase quotas&#13;
rose from 7 in 1971 to 22 in 1976; seller-buyer relationships were centrally&#13;
determined in 41 cases in 1976 conpared to 9 such cases in 1971; import quotas&#13;
was increased from 7 to 33 during this period; and foreign exchange&#13;
restrictions were applied to limit the growth of imports.  These measures,&#13;
taken in conjunction with reductions in export subsidies and the imposition of&#13;
export taxes, raised the level of import protection relative to that of export&#13;
subsidies in Hungary.&#13;
The reduced reliance on price signals was accompanied by limitations on&#13;
the freedom of the firm in making investment decisions. A rising proportion&#13;
of investments undertaken by firms necessitated financing from outside&#13;
sources, chiefly bank credit and budget support. At the same time, obtaining&#13;
bank credit and budget suipport increasingly required the firm to conform to&#13;
the priorities set by the government. Special credits assumed considerable&#13;
importance, with 18-20 credit quotas set for particular purposes and state&#13;
preferences importantly affecting allocation within each quota. State&#13;
preferences also had an important role in the allocation of budget support,&#13;
and the supervisory ministries exerted increasing influence on the choice of&#13;
investments by the firms.&#13;
V. The Ectonomic Effects of the Policies Applied&#13;
Following the application of deflationary policies as an immediate&#13;
response to external shocks, outward-oriented market economies experienced&#13;
rapid increases in exports and in national income. In the 1975-78 period, GNP&#13;
growth rates averaged 5.5 percent in Greece, 5.2 percent in Japan, 11.7&#13;
percent in Korea, and 10.9 percent in Taiwan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
In turn, reliance on foreign borrowing permitted inward-oriented&#13;
economies to maintain past economic growth rates only for a time. As the&#13;
borrowed funds were used largely to increase consumption and to carry out&#13;
costly investments behind high and often increasing protection, these&#13;
countries did not generate the foreign exchange necessary to service foreign&#13;
loans and to maintain high rates of economic growth after the mid-seventies.&#13;
An extreme case is provided by Turkey that had to apply strong deflationary&#13;
policies as additional borrowing became practically impossible (Balassa,&#13;
1981).&#13;
Hungary accepted a decline in the rate of growth of aggregate domestic&#13;
expenditure in 1976, when consumption increased by 2.1 percent and net&#13;
investment declined by 1.4 percent, corresponding to a 3.0 percent increase in&#13;
the net material product. The resulting improvement in the balance of&#13;
payments proved temporary, however. In 1977 and in 1978, the rate of growth&#13;
of aggregate domestic expenditure again exceeded that of output, leading to an&#13;
acceleration of import growth and a slowdown of export expansion in&#13;
convertible currency trade. Correspondingly, the deficit in this trade rose&#13;
from $0.3 billion in 1976 to $0.6 billion in 1977 and to $1.1 billion in 1978,&#13;
and Hungary's net indebtedness in convertible currencies reached $5.0 billion&#13;
at the end of 1979 compared to $0.9 billion six years earlier.&#13;
Deflationary policies were applied anew in subsequent years, with&#13;
domestic consumption rising by 2.9 percent in 1979 and 1.4 percent in 1980,&#13;
after having increased by nearly 5 percent a year in the preceding two&#13;
years. Furthermore, large increases in investment (in particular, inventory&#13;
accumulation) in 1977 and 1978 gave place to substantial declines in the two&#13;
years afterwards (Table 1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
As a result of these changes, Hungary's deficit in convertible currency&#13;
trade declined to $0.3 billion in 1979 and was practically eliminated in&#13;
1980. Nevertheless, the servicing of foreign loans contracted earlier led to&#13;
a further increase in Hungary's net debt in convertible currency to $5.4&#13;
billion at the end of 1980.&#13;
All in all, the data show that Hungary postponed cutbacks in consumption&#13;
growth and experienced substantial fluctuations in investment activity in the&#13;
period following external shocks. Furthermore, available evidence&#13;
indicates the influence of the level of domestic activity on exports and&#13;
points to the existence of a high short-term income elasticity of demand for&#13;
imports in convertible currency trade, although the import elasticity was&#13;
moderated by the imposition of foreign exchange restrictions.&#13;
Fluctuations in investment activity may be explained by the lack of use&#13;
of macroeconomic policy instruments and the excessive investment demand that&#13;
gave way only to quantitative measures. Excessive investment demand, in turn,&#13;
reflected an accommodating stance on the part of public authorities in the&#13;
event of losses by firms and in the provision of investment funds.l/&#13;
Until 1976, the role of profitability considerations on the firm level&#13;
was further reduced by reason of the fact that there was no repayment&#13;
obligation for the amounts received in the form of budget support. Since that&#13;
time, firms had to repay budget support with interest from their pre-tax&#13;
profits.&#13;
Also, in January 1976, domestic producer prices were brought nearer to&#13;
world market price relations and export incentives were increased by&#13;
1/ Kornai (1979 and 1980) speaks of a "soft budget constraint," under which&#13;
the-firm's activities are not limited either by its financial position or by&#13;
the risk of bankruptcy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
abolishing export taxes and raising export subsidies. Subsequently, a fund&#13;
was established to provide financing for investment aimed at increasing&#13;
convertible currency exports. The National Bank grants credit on a&#13;
competitive basis to firms whose net foreign exchange earnings over five years&#13;
at least equal the amount invested, and the exports of which are profitable at&#13;
the existing commercial exchange rate.&#13;
Increased incentives to exports contributed to the growth of exports in&#13;
convertible currencies. These incentives did not suffice, however, to regain&#13;
earlier export growth rates. Thus, the volume of exports in convertible&#13;
currencies rose only 74 percent a year between 1973 and 1978 as compared to an&#13;
increase of 10 percent a year between 1968 and 1973. Also, with average&#13;
annual increases of 15 percent in the dollar value of exports to developed and&#13;
developing market economies, including Yugoslavia, Hungary fell behind the&#13;
Soviet Union (21 percent), Romania (1.9 percent), East Germany and Poland (18&#13;
percent), and surpassed only Czechoslovakia (13 percent) among socialist&#13;
countries. Exports were given further impetus by the deflationary measures&#13;
applied in 1979 when the volume of 14ungary's convertible currency exports&#13;
increased by 16 percent.&#13;
VI.  The 1980-81 Reforms&#13;
While domestic producer prices were brought nearer to world market price&#13;
relations in January 197.6, substantial differences remained; the price of&#13;
petroleum, for example, was still only 60 percent of the world market price.&#13;
Also, notwithstanding some reductions in consumer subsidies, there continued&#13;
to be large differences between the structure of producer and consumer prices.&#13;
With continuing differences between domestic and world market prices,&#13;
firm-by-firm production taxes and budget support were retained. The&#13;
introduction of selective tax exemptions and wage preferences provided to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
firms that undertake an obligation to expand exports also added an element of&#13;
voluntarism in the decision-making process, further reducing the role of&#13;
profit incentives for the firms.&#13;
However, it became increasingly understood that the existing regulations&#13;
would need to be thoroughly revamped in order to ensure that Hungary will best&#13;
utilize its opportunities in exploiting its comparative advantage for economic&#13;
growth. It was further recognized that this will require resuming the process&#13;
of decentralization of decision-making, giving greater role to profit&#13;
incentives, and rationalizing producer and consumer prices.&#13;
The October 1977 resolution of the Central Committee of the Hungarian&#13;
Socialist Workers Party re-emphasized the central role of exports in&#13;
Hungarian economic growth and stated the need to let firms decide on the&#13;
product composition of theiLr exports as well as on changes in their production&#13;
structure. Subsequently, i:he December 1978 Party resolution called for giving&#13;
increased emphasis to the profit motive, reducing the scope of government&#13;
preferences and central interventions, and rationalizing the price system.&#13;
These guidelines underlie the reform measures introduced on January 1,&#13;
1980.1/  The lynchpin of the reforms was the introduction of 'competitive&#13;
prices in the industrial s-ector. The purpose has been to increasingly align&#13;
domestic producer prices with world marlcet prices, thereby undoing the adverse&#13;
effects of measures taken after 1973 and re-affirming the objectives&#13;
enunciated at the time of the 1968 reform.&#13;
The domestic prices of raw materials, fuels, and basic intermediate&#13;
products have been equated to import prices paid in convertible currency&#13;
1/ The following discussion is based largely on Csik6s-Nagy (1980) and&#13;
Horvgth (1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
trade, involving considerable increases in these prices. In the future,&#13;
domestic prices will vary with changes in prices paid in convertible&#13;
currencies and in the exchange rate. At the same time, differences between&#13;
world market prices and prices in trade with the socialist countries are&#13;
compensated by taxes and subsidies.&#13;
Industrial exporters receive the price obtained in convertible currencies&#13;
times the exchange rate, plus a rebate for imputed indirect taxes at a rate of&#13;
10 percent of export value, except for light industrial products (originally&#13;
16 percent, but subsequently reduced to 13 percent) and for iron and steel&#13;
(nil, but subsequently set at 5 percent). Exceptions have been made, however,&#13;
in cases where the domestic cost of earning foreign exchange exceeds the&#13;
exchange rate. In such instances, compensation payments are to be provided&#13;
for a period of five years on a decreasing scale. Also, production taxes for&#13;
individual firms have been abolished and while, in exceptional cases, firms&#13;
receive budget support, this is also done on a temporary basis.&#13;
For firms that export more than 5 percent of their output in convertible&#13;
currency trade, accounting for about two-thirds of industrial production, the&#13;
allowable profit margin in setting prices for domestic sales in January 1980&#13;
was determined on the basis of the domestic cost of earning foreign&#13;
exchange. In the future, these firms cannot increase their domestic prices to&#13;
an extent greater than the rise in export prices (domestic prices will have to&#13;
be reduced if export prices fall), with the profitability of exports providing&#13;
a further constraint in price setting. In turn, an average profit margin was&#13;
applied in the case of firms exporting less than five percent of their output&#13;
in convertible currency trade, with future changes in prices made dependent on&#13;
changes in costs.&#13;
The use of  competitive   prices will lead to greater inter-firm&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
variations in profits, and hence in the remuneration of management and&#13;
workers.  While increases in wages- continue to be limited by progressive&#13;
taxes, the new regulations provide inducement for increasing productivity and&#13;
for limiting the size of the work force of the firm. It is also envisaged&#13;
that firms which continue to make losses at world market prices will&#13;
eventually disappear through mergers or bankruptcy procedures.&#13;
The use of profitability as the success criterion and the condition for&#13;
bonuses is not compatible with interventions in the firm-s operations. As the&#13;
maintenance of the existing ministerial structure would have created the&#13;
danger of continued interve;ntions, the industrial ministries have been&#13;
consolidated into a single ministry, although the production of construction&#13;
materials and food processing continue to come under the Ministries of&#13;
Construction and Agriculture, respectively.&#13;
Firms have also been given greater freedom in their investment&#13;
decisions. The large number of credit quotas have been consolidated into a&#13;
few categories, permitting greater competition based on the profitability of&#13;
the investment. At the same time, the availability of credit for export&#13;
production has been increased, with additional facilities provided for import&#13;
substitution.&#13;
Budget support to investment will be limited to cases when the firm-s&#13;
profitability is adversely affected by centrally imposed deviations from world&#13;
market prices. However, the choice among, claimants is to be made on the basis&#13;
of the profitability of investment in terms of undistorted prices.&#13;
As noted in Section I, the high degree of industrial concentration&#13;
reduced competition in Hungary. In order to increase competition, seventy new&#13;
firms have been established by breaking up horizontal trusts and large&#13;
firms. These changes have occurred in coal mining and in the production of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
wine, sugar, confectionary, cigarettes, construction materials, shoes, and, to&#13;
a lesser extent, machinery.&#13;
The organizational changes were carried out on July 1, 1980 and on&#13;
January 1, 1981. The consolidation of industrial ministries took place on&#13;
January 1, 1981. On the same date, some changes in regulations also occurred,&#13;
generally aimed at further simplification.&#13;
VI. Agriculture and the 'Second Economy'&#13;
The measures introduced on and after January 1, 1980 have reversed the&#13;
process of re-centralization observable since the early seventies, and have&#13;
carried the decentralization of decision making beyond that existing&#13;
beforehand. Decentralization has been linked to the greater role given to&#13;
profitability that will be increasingly determined by world market price&#13;
relationships.&#13;
Differences in the structure of domestic producer and consumer prices of&#13;
industrial products have also been reduced. This has involved eliminating&#13;
capital charges and reducing social security contributions by producers,&#13;
imposing a uniform turnover tax on the bulk of these products, and reducing&#13;
consumer subsidies.&#13;
The producer prices of agricultural products are set on the basis of&#13;
production costs, with certain adjustments made in accordance with world&#13;
market price relations. Agricultural prices in Hungary exceed world market&#13;
prices, although they are substantially lower than domestic prices in the&#13;
European Common Market where much of Hungary's exports are sold. At the same&#13;
time, the extent of budget support to agriculture has been reduced while the&#13;
export rebate rate has been set at 28 percent.&#13;
Agriculture continues to play an important role in the Hungarian economy,&#13;
accounting for 14 percent of the net material product and for 23 percent of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
exports, including processed food, in 1980. Gross output in agriculture grew&#13;
at an average annual rate of 3.5 percent between 1970 and 1980, exceeding the&#13;
increase shown in any other European country.&#13;
With food consumption rising at an average annual rate of 1.5 percent&#13;
during the seventies, exportable production rose at a rate much exceeding that&#13;
of gross output. In the second half of the decade, about 50 percent of the&#13;
increment in gross output was exported, with over 25 percent of agricultural&#13;
output and 30 percent of processed food destined for export towards the end of&#13;
the decade (Bir6 et al. 1980, p. 210).&#13;
As a result, the share of agricultural products in total exports declined&#13;
only slightly, from 25 percent in 1970 to 23 percent in 1980, with processed&#13;
food accounting for two-thirds of the total. More generally, a shift occurred&#13;
towards the exportation of higher value products, such as livestock, meat,&#13;
poultry, wine, and processed fruits and vegetables. Of further interest is&#13;
the emergence of new export products, including rabbit meat and eggs for&#13;
poultry raising.&#13;
Rapid increases in exports and the transformation of the export structure&#13;
in part reflects the response to incentives by agricultural co-operatives that&#13;
are profit-making units. Another important factor has been the development of&#13;
small-scale agriculture, consisting of household plots owned by co-operative,&#13;
state farm, and industrial employees, retirees, and to a lesser extent,&#13;
private farms.&#13;
Apart: from 1975, when a hardening of the tone on the part of Party&#13;
officials led to the wholesale slaughter of pigs, small-scale agriculture has&#13;
been increasingly supported by the government. Recent measures include a&#13;
threefold increase in the threshold of taxable income derived from small-scale&#13;
agriculture, greater investment in this sector, and the lease of land by state&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
farms and co-operatives that was not suitable for large-scale farming.   Such&#13;
leases would permit members of agricultural co-operatives to double the size&#13;
of their household plots from the 0.6 hectares that is provided free to all&#13;
members; other small-scale cultivators could increase the area they cultivate&#13;
to even a greater extent (Swain, 1981 pp. 246-47).&#13;
Small-scale agriculture, characterized by intensive cultivation, provides&#13;
36 percent of agricultural output, compared to 30 percent in 1970 (Gabor and&#13;
Galasi, 1981, p. 65). It accounts for over four-fifths of the production of&#13;
early vegetables, two-thirds of the production of eggs, and over one-half of&#13;
pigs, poultry, wine grapes, fruits, and vegetables (Palovics, 1981, p. 428).&#13;
The new economic mechanism has also contributed to the expansion of the&#13;
ancillary activities of agricultural co-operatives that were discouraged prior&#13;
to the 1968 reform (V. Nagy, 1973). The volume of output of these activities&#13;
rose by 115 percent from 1970 to 1980, when they came to account for 35&#13;
percent of the total output of agricultural co-operatives; in the same period,&#13;
the gross agricultural output of the co-operatives increased by 59 percent.&#13;
A study of 86 agricultural co-operatives further indicates that ancillary&#13;
activities are more profitable than agricultural activities, with the average&#13;
profit margin being 11.5 percent in the first case and 2.4 percent in the&#13;
second in 1979.  In the same year, these co-operatives derived over 90 percent&#13;
of their profits from ancillary activities (Vida, 1981). While the ratio is&#13;
not representative of all agricultural co-operatives, since those in the&#13;
sample had a higher share of ancillary activities than the average, it is&#13;
noteworthy that in the 86 co-operatives output per asset value and output per&#13;
worker were several times higher in ancillary activities (4.60 and 436&#13;
thousand forints) than in agricultural activities (0.55 and 157 thousand&#13;
forints) (Ibid.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
Ancillary activities provide in part for the needs of the co-operative&#13;
itself and of other co-operatives that the large industrial firms are unable&#13;
or unwilling to provide. They involve, in particular, the manufacture of&#13;
simple agricultural implements, wood products, and construction materials, as&#13;
well as local construction. Their activities further extend to agricultural&#13;
processing and to the manufacture of parts and components for large industrial&#13;
firms.&#13;
The production of parts and components by agricultural co-operatives is a&#13;
reflection of the excessive concentration of the Hungarian engineering&#13;
industries, where the network of small and medium size firms producing parts&#13;
and components exists only in a rudimentary form. In fact, the share of firms&#13;
with over 1000 workers in the total employment of the engineering industries&#13;
was 88 percent in Hungary, 66 percent in the Soviet Union, 38 percent in West&#13;
Germany, and 28 percent in the United States (Bossgnyi, 1979).&#13;
Industrial co-operatives play an increasing role in producing parts and&#13;
components for large industrial firms in Hungary. They also manufacture a&#13;
variety of products for consumption and even for export. An oft-cited example&#13;
is the joint venture formed by Radelkisz of Budapest with Corning Glass of the&#13;
United States for the production of blood analyzers.&#13;
In 1980, the industrial co-operatives employed 14 percent of the&#13;
industrial labor force. They had only 3 percent of the industrial capital&#13;
stock, however, reflecting the fact that they largely produce labor-intensive&#13;
items in response to consumer and export demand. And while these co-&#13;
operatives are reported to have provided 6 percent of gross industrial output,&#13;
given the low share of material inputs, they accounted for a much higher&#13;
proportion of net output.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Industrial co-operatives have the advantages of flexibility in deciding&#13;
on their product composition, setting prices, remunerating labor, and&#13;
undertaking investment. Similar considerations apply to construction co-&#13;
operatives that accounted for 22 percent of the labor force in the&#13;
construction industry in 1980 but had a share in fixed assets of only one-&#13;
third as much. And, again, the 17 percent reported production share may&#13;
understate their contribution to construction activity.&#13;
The so-called 'second economy' possesses even greater flexibility than&#13;
the co-operatives. As defined by Gabor and Galasi (1981, pp. 17-18), it&#13;
includes small-scale agricultural production, officially recognized and&#13;
registered private non-agricultural activities, and not officially registered&#13;
activities, generally on the part of those whose main occupation is in the&#13;
large-scale socialist sector.&#13;
According to a well-known Hungarian sociologist, "the economic reason for&#13;
the existence of the second economy is evident. The socially-organized&#13;
production is not able to satisfy all the emerging needs in appropriate&#13;
quantity and/or quality" (Ferge, 1978, p. 121). At the same time, the&#13;
existence of the second economy has been accepted as "the integral part of the&#13;
socialist economy" (Lukacs, 1981a, p. 5).&#13;
It has been estimated that work performed on private agricultural plots&#13;
is equivalent to 750-800 thousand man-years and that 250 thousand people have&#13;
their main occupation in the private non-agricultural sector. Furthermore,&#13;
private construction activity is said to involve the annual work time of 150-&#13;
200 thousand people, and it is responsible for the building of one-half of all&#13;
dwellings (Gabor and Galasi, 1981, pp. 47-49).&#13;
Altogether 1.2 million man-years are expended in these branches of the&#13;
second economy, compared to an economically active population of 5.2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
million. The numbers do not include work done in the evening and on weekends&#13;
as a part-time second job, although about: one-third of building maintenance&#13;
and two-thirds of television, automobile, and other repairs are said to be&#13;
performed in the second economy. 1/   Each of these activities involves about&#13;
100 thousand people (Ibid); according to one estimate, in 1979 hourly earnings&#13;
in such activities were abouLt five times higher than in the large-scale sector&#13;
(Marrese, 1981, p. 58).&#13;
It appears, then, that Fungary has established an economic system which&#13;
combines the large-scale socialist sector, co-operatives, and small-scale&#13;
private activities in a flexible manner. The success of this formula may&#13;
explain the availability of a wide range of consumer goods and services that&#13;
is unique in the CMEA area. New legal structures in effect from January 1,&#13;
1982 concerning the establishment of small and medium-size firms in the&#13;
socialist sector, including subsidiary enterprises of existing firms, the&#13;
creation of small co-operatives and smaller groupings in existing co-&#13;
operatives, the founding of private partnerships, the leasing of equipment to&#13;
private interests, and the liberalization of regulations affecting private&#13;
artisans will further contribute to the expansion of the second economy.&#13;
1/  Nor do the figures allow for the so-called   third economy   that includes&#13;
illegal and extralegal activities, such as the use for private profit of&#13;
material or work-time of socialist firms (Lukacs, 1981b).&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This paper reviews the Hungarian
            experience with the economic reform introduced on January 1,
            1968. It draws on the author's earlier writings on the
            Hungarian reform, with the addition of new material on
            agriculture, on the 'second economy' and on the
            policy measures introduced in 1980 and in 1981. Following a
            short description of the antecedents of the reform, the
            paper analyses the reform measures introduced in 1968
            concerning agriculture, decision-making by industrial firms,
            price determination, the exchange rate subsidies, import
            protection, and investment decisions, further indicating
            their effects on the Hungarian economy. Next, the tendencies
            towards recentralization after 1971 and, in particular,
            after the external shocks of 1973 are examined, with
            consideration given to their economic effects. The reversal
            of these tendencies in 1980 and 1981, and the role of
            agriculture and of the 'second economy' in
            Hungary, are the subject of the concluding sections of the paper.
