        <abstracts>
            Governments often regulate not only the
            overall level of prices charged by infrastructure firms but
            also the relationship between prices for different services
            or customers.  Prices can differ among different types of
            customers, even when no customers can be said to be
            subsidizing another, for example, when one asset is used to
            supply a service to two or more groups of customers.  One of
            the hurdles that governments must overcome in introducing
            competition in infrastructure is dealing with the social and
            political implications of changing price structures, or rate
            rebalancing.  Generally, competition should reduce overall
            costs in the sector, lessening the need to compensate groups
            hurt by price increases resulting from rate rebalancing.
            But if the efficiency gains are not enough to offset the
            price increases for some groups and the government is
            worried about the political and social costs of rate
            balancing, it has three basic options:  1) preserving the
            old price structure; 2) funding price subsidies from general
            tax revenue rather than from transfers within the firm or
            industry; and 3) relying on social safety nets rather than
            price subsidies.  Whichever option a government chooses
            should stand up against the following four tests: 1) Do
            subsidies reach the people the government most wants to
            support?  2) are the costs clear and measurable?  3) Are the
            administrative costs as low as possible? 4) Is the revenue
            raised from the source that entails the least cost to the
            economy?  This Note looks at the three options in practice
            and reviews how they measure up against the four criteria.
            It concludes that governments should eliminate price
            subsidies if politically feasible.  But even if they cannot,
            they can still reap the benefits of competition.
