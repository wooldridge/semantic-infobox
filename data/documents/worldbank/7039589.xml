            Phasing out subsidies : recent experiences
            with fuel in developing countries
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Many developing countries subsidize
            petroleum products. The doubling of world oil prices since
            January 2004 has had very high fiscal costs for these
            countries, increasing public debt and squeezing other
            government spending. The subsidies have also had unintended
            results. But phasing out subsidies is politically
            challenging. This paper reviews some successful strategies
            for removing or reducing subsidies while protecting the
            poorest consumers.
