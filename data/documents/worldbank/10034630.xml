      Box 1: Restructuring ­ The Western Australia Model&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Prior to 1996, the Water Authority of Western Australia provided water services in Western Australia and was responsible for&#13;
      water resource management. It also set standards for customer services with a certain degree of external benchmarking, but&#13;
      without independent oversight. The government set prices on an annual basis as an integral part of its budgeting process for&#13;
      all government activities. In 1996 it was restructured to form three separate organizations.&#13;
       Water Corporation: A corporatized utility, wholly government-owned, providing water supply, sewerage, irrigation&#13;
          and drainage services under license to a majority of communities.&#13;
       Office of Water Regulation: Provides licenses and sets and enforces standards for water service provision for&#13;
          the regulation of the quality of services.&#13;
       Water and Rivers Commission: Manages and cares for the state's water resources.&#13;
&#13;
      Some of the salient features of switching to the public corporate model are:&#13;
      Ownership: The corporation is wholly-owned by the government, through the Minister for Water Resources, its sole&#13;
      shareholder. Although there is no private ownership, there is considerable scope for private sector participation (PSP)&#13;
      through joint ventures or alliances with the private sector.&#13;
      Separation from General Operations: It enjoys a considerable degree of separation, with no obligation to comply with the&#13;
      general day-to-day administrative policies or public service regulations to which other government entities are obliged.&#13;
      Governance: Its management must focus on the delivery of services and on agreed business outcomes. Has a board of&#13;
      directors that oversees the corporation's functions. The board has a high level of management autonomy and authority, but&#13;
      the shareholder has the power to overview the operations of some aspects of strategic issues.&#13;
      Management and Regulation: There is a separation of regulatory functions from service delivery. The corporation has to&#13;
      obtain an operating license from the Office of Water Regulation, which sets out the terms and conditions for provisions of&#13;
      services and standards for service delivery and customer service.&#13;

&#13;
Box 2: Alliance Model&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Alliance Model offers an interesting form of PPP that seems to be gaining popularity in Australia. The `alliance' typically includes the&#13;
staff of the client, consultants, and contractors in a project environment which is built on trust, equity, and the absence of blame.&#13;
Services Contracts&#13;
       In 1995, the Water Corporation offered two contracts for the maintenance and operation of the water distribution and&#13;
sewerage infrastructure for the city of Perth, with each contract worth around A$ 15 million per year over a period of five years.&#13;
The contractors were required to set up a separate company, a `service company', to perform the work involved. These&#13;
companies were paid direct operating and maintenance costs, a management fee, and an annual performance bonus. The&#13;
companies are run on an open book basis. An `alliance board', comprising two or more senior client and the contractor&#13;
representatives, meets at least quarterly. It makes the key decisions on the works, and agrees upon an annual budget and&#13;
performance targets. Such decisions must be unanimous, otherwise the chairman (who is appointed by the client organization)&#13;
provides final arbitration. The performance bonus is based on a number of factors, including performance levels and the degree&#13;
to which the budget is met or bettered. Bonuses are paid for a particular year's achievement only, further improvements being&#13;
required if bonuses are to be paid for subsequent years.&#13;
       The alliance model was adopted because of the complexity involved in the day-to-day operation of water and sewerage&#13;
services in major urban areas. To some extent, this arrangement alleviates the obvious difficulty and bureaucratic workload&#13;
entailed in managing such contracts on a schedule-of-rates basis.&#13;
       Registrations of interest were invited and a shortlist of eligible contractors invited to tender. The information provided at the&#13;
time of invitation to tender was brief in comparison with the large volume that would accompany a traditional call for tenders. The&#13;
contract documents were then developed through a process of consultation (lasting several months) between the client's and the&#13;
contractors' staff. Both parties were mandated to assign staff to this negotiation process who would then take on the&#13;
responsibility for the eventual operation of the contract. This negotiation process formed an essential part of the building of a&#13;
cohesive team to focus on agreed `alliance' objectives.&#13;
       Because the initial contracts sought to replace competent direct labor workforces, the contractors were required, prior to&#13;
taking up the works, to offer employment to each member of the Water Corporation's indirectly-related workforce. It was&#13;
stipulated that the terms of employment must be at least as favorable as those previously enjoyed. This worked very well, with a&#13;
total of 209 public service employees taking up jobs with the contractors. A great advantage of this approach was that the&#13;
contractor took over a ready-skilled group of workers, adding to its own (and the client's) confidence.&#13;
       A further advantage of creating a separate service company is that it offers the Water Corporation the ability to change&#13;
contractors more readily in the future. Under this model, incoming contractors can choose to offer employment to the workforce&#13;
of the existing service company. From the Water Corporation's point of view, it is seen to be advantageous to retain skilled&#13;
staff while changing contractors.&#13;
Construction Contracts&#13;
       The alliance model was adopted for Sydney Water's Northside sewage storage tunnel project, which would not have been&#13;
completed before 2001 under normal contracting methods, but was required in time for the 2000 Olympics. Because of&#13;
significant negative community perception of the project, the alliance model was seen as a way of addressing these concerns.&#13;
The members of the alliance set five performance criteria against which the success of the project would be measured: time,&#13;
cost, safety, environment, and community. Benchmarks were set for each criterion, to be scored and audited by independent third&#13;
parties. Failure to achieve success on any one of the criteria would lose the alliance 50 percent of its potential profit.&#13;
Woodman Alliance 21&#13;
       A similar approach has been applied in Western Australia to the design, construction, and initial operation of a&#13;
A$ 150-million expansion to the Woodman Point wastewater treatment plant. The augmentation project has been implemented&#13;
by an alliance ­ called the Woodman Alliance 21 ­ of the Water Corp of WA (client), Kellogg Brown, and Roots Pvt. Ltd.&#13;
(KBR, consultant), and Clough (contractor).&#13;
       Once the alliance partners were selected (in this case KBR and Clough) they worked as a team on a `Best for Project' basis.&#13;
The other advantage of the structure is that design and construction activities overlap. Payments for costs incurred were&#13;
paid into the account of the alliance, based on previous estimates (the Project Total Cost, PTC). In addition, the private partners&#13;
were paid a pre-determined fee (to cover profits and overheads). They got rewarded for saving on the PTC and losses were&#13;
shared in case of cost over-runs. In this case, the project was completed in time at a cost of A$ 149 million, against an estimated&#13;
PTC of A$ 153 million. More important, the model enabled the generation of a number of efficient and cost-saving innovations.&#13;

&#13;
         Box 3: Prevalent Examples of Private Sector Participation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Contracts for Services. Service contracts have been typically adopted in Operation and Management (O&amp;M), fleet&#13;
          management, meter reading, engineering design, IT services, etc. The increase in service contracts has resulted in a&#13;
          corresponding decrease in public servants within the water utilities. In certain cases, contractors and consultants have been&#13;
          required to offer positions to affected government employees (whose other options have included voluntary severance packages).&#13;
          This has proved to be a useful means of reducing the numbers of public servants, given that most governments have policies that&#13;
          preclude forced retrenchment. For example, in the Water Corporation in WA, 500 of its 1,500 employees were impacted by&#13;
          outsource contracts and cost-cutting measures, and subsequently took up new careers under such a process.&#13;
          BOO/BOOT Schemes. The most notable example is the Prospect Water Filtration Plant, which treats the bulk of Sydney's&#13;
          supply. This is run by Australian Water Services (AWS), a consortium comprising Lyonnaise des Eaux, Land Lease Corp, and&#13;
          P&amp;O Australia. Sydney Water pays a fee comprising an availability charge covering 80 percent of the project's fixed costs,&#13;
          and a variable charge based on the quantum of water treated.&#13;
          Management Contract. This is the single instance of a management contract. South Australian Water has contracted out&#13;
          the O&amp;M of Adelaide's water and wastewater systems to United Water, for a period of 15 years. United Water: (a) manages,&#13;
          maintains, and operates the systems in the Adelaide urban area; (b) manages the associated capital works program;&#13;
          and (c) provides project management (but not construction) services for these assets. SA Water owns the assets, and is&#13;
          responsible for customer service and billing. As noted earlier, this is not too different from a service contract for O&amp;M. SA&#13;
          Water is responsible for the raw water supply and storage for Adelaide, as well as all the services in the rest of the state. The&#13;
          contract was not awarded on the basis of a competitive tender but through a request for proposals. The reimbursable costs&#13;
          to the utility are determined annually. However, there are provisions for sharing savings as well as cost over-runs. The fee for&#13;
          services, decided at the outset of the first five years, is then subsequently re-negotiated.&#13;
          Alliance Model. This is a somewhat unique approach (`alliance contracting') and was pioneered in the petroleum sector and&#13;
          first introduced in the Australian water sector by the Water Corporation of Western Australia. This involves forming a single&#13;
          company, which (though not formally incorporated) is committed to maximizing achievements against an agreed set of&#13;
          objectives with an agreed risk and reward structure for the different alliance partners. The alliance includes the staff of the&#13;
          client, consultants, and contractors in a project environment that is built on trust, cooperation, and fair play.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Box 4: ACTEW-AGL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      ACTEW-AGL is a partnership between the public sector energy and water company ACTEW (earlier Australian Capital&#13;
      Territory Energy and Water), and AGL (Australian Gas and Light), a private sector energy and gas company.&#13;
&#13;
      History&#13;
       ACTEW's origins lie in a Federal works department.&#13;
&#13;
       In 1988, an Energy and Water Authority was created for the Australian Capital Territory by a legislation.&#13;
       The utility was incorporated in 1995 and became a corporation owned by ACT.&#13;
       Reform and privatization attempts.&#13;
           An attempt to sell the corporation off through a `trade sale' (to raise money and increase efficiency) did not work as there&#13;
            was considerable opposition to selling off water assets.&#13;
           An aborted attempt to merge with the NSW government-owned corporation.&#13;
           Following this, the government advertised for offers without specifying terms and conditions. Of 19 offers received, that&#13;
            of AGL was accepted. AGL was a well-established (in 1837) and respected Australian company and, thus, politically acceptable.&#13;
&#13;
      Structure&#13;
       ACTEW placed its electricity assets and AGL its gas assets (plus cash) into an equal partnership company,&#13;
          ACTEW-AGL (in October 2000).&#13;
       The water assets remained with the state-owned asset-holding company, ACTEW.&#13;
       Three of the board members of ACTEW sit on the ACTEW-AGL six-member board. The other three are from AGL.&#13;
          (This is similar to the Alliance Model that is described elsewhere in this note.) Staff members have been seconded to&#13;
          ACTEW-AGL from the parent companies.&#13;
       ACTEW has a contract with ACTEW-AGL for managing the water business. It is a management contract based on&#13;
          estimated costs (total operating costs, TOC) plus a fee. The entire water sector revenue goes to ACTEW, the&#13;
          asset-holding company.&#13;
       ACTEW-AGL has a contract with Agility, a fully-owned subsidiary of AGL, for managing the gas business.&#13;
       The power network is owned and managed by ACTEW-AGL.&#13;
       Under the arrangement, profits are shared between ACTEW and AGL. AGL pays federal taxes but ACTEW pays only&#13;
          state taxes, being a state-owned company.&#13;
       A separate telecom company (TransACT) is also owned by ACTEW.&#13;
       The group is thus a true multi-sector utility (water, electricity, gas, and telecom).&#13;
&#13;
      Regulation&#13;
       Technical regulation follows from the Utilities Act (governing all four sectors), an Environment Protection Act,&#13;
          a Public Health Act, and a Water Resources Act.&#13;
       The Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission is the economic regulator. The economic regulator sets a revenue&#13;
          cap. Actual tariff levels as well as structures are left to the company.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Tariffs for water vary between A$ 0.30-0.40 per kl, at the lowest end, to around A$ 0.90-0.95 per kl at the highest end.&#13;
                 WCWA has tariffs as high as A$ 1-1.40 per kl for annual usage above 750 kl.&#13;
           Actual average annual bills per connection range from approximately A$ 180 to A$ 450, with the modal value&#13;
                 between A$ 200-300.&#13;
           Average annual bills, based on an annual consumption of 200 kl,25range from A$ 150 to A$ 270.&#13;
           Actual sewerage charges vary between A$ 180-400 annually.&#13;
           The total annual charge for sewerage services, based on a 200 kl annual consumption, varies from about A$ 330&#13;
                 (Goulborn Valley Water) to A$ 623 (WCWA).&#13;
           Given the manner in which water and sewerage charges are generally structured, a halving of water use has only about&#13;
                 a 10 percent impact on the total bill (see Table 2).&#13;

            Lessons for India : Australia's water
            sector reforms
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Australian water sector, in
            particular the developments in the sector during the last
            8-10 years, offers a wide range of experiences and models
            that could usefully inform the sector discourse in India.
            Although the Australian reforms cover all rural and urban
            water services, including the management of resources and
            irrigation, this note focuses on urban water and sanitation
            services. This note summarizes some of the key developments
            in the Australian water sector, with the objective of
            identifying aspects of the reform approach and its outcomes
            that are relevant to India.
