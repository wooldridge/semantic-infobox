The Governance, Regulation and Finance Division (WBIGF) of the World Bank Institute, in collaboration&#13;
with the OECD Centre for Private Sector Development, conducted a policy workshop on Financial&#13;
Systems Reform: Crisis Management and Supervision in Istanbul, Turkey, from June 15 to June 17,&#13;
1999. The purpose of the workshop was to provide senior policy makers in transition economies in the&#13;
Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region with an opportunity to discuss issues of the recent financial crises&#13;
in Russia and Asia, and assist them in formulating appropriate banking and financial system policies for&#13;
their own countries. There were three major objectives for the workshop: 1) providing participants with&#13;
the empirical findings and policy implications on the recent financial crises, in order to allow them to find&#13;
useful information that is relevant to their own financial reform agenda; 2) helping them to determine&#13;
practical steps and strategies to formulate and implement policy priorities on the reform agenda; and 3)&#13;
providing a dialogue forum to exchange information and build networks among participants and&#13;
instructors. A total of 50 participants attended the workshop from 20 countries in the ECA region,&#13;
consisting of policy makers and managers from the Central Banks, Ministries of Finance, and Securities&#13;
Exchange Commissions. Sixteen participants (32%) were women. The workshop was supported by the&#13;
WBI's Economic Policy and Poverty Reduction Division (WBIEP), and was incorporated as part of its&#13;
Program titled, "Capacity Building in Economic Policy for Central Asia."&#13;
&#13;
The WBI Evaluation Unit (WBIES) conducted an on-site Level 1 (participants' reaction) evaluation using a&#13;
participants' feedback questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of three sections. The first section&#13;
asked the extent to which the respondents were satisfied with workshop content and delivery. The&#13;
second section asked the level of respondents knowledge about specific topics before and after the&#13;
workshop, based on self-assessment. A 5-point Likert type scale that ranged from 1=minimum to&#13;
5=maximum was used for each question. The third section consisted of respondents' open-ended&#13;
comments about the course. The questionnaire was completed and returned by 44 participants present&#13;
on the third day, or 88% of all participants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Respondent Background&#13;
&#13;
    ·   Of the 44 respondents who returned the questionnaire, 16 (36.4%) represented Central Banks,&#13;
        14 (31.8%) were from the Ministry of Finance or other government agencies, and 13 were from&#13;
        Securities Exchange Commissions (29.5%). Fourteen out of the 44 respondents were women&#13;
        (31.8%).&#13;
&#13;
    ·   The question on educational background showed that a large majority of the respondents had&#13;
        advanced university degrees in the field of finance or economics. Twenty-nine respondents&#13;
        (65.9%) reported having completed either doctorate (13.6%) or masters degrees or equivalent&#13;
        (52.3%). Thirteen respondents (29.5%) had bachelors or equivalent first university degrees, and&#13;
        the remaining 2 respondents (4.6%) had either secondary education or virtually no formal study&#13;
        in either finance or economics. Female respondents had a minimum of bachelors degrees in one&#13;
        of the two areas, and most of them had advanced degrees, either masters degrees (N=9) or&#13;
        doctorate (N=2).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Workshop Content and Delivery&#13;
&#13;
  ·  A key indicator of respondents' level of satisfaction with the workshop, the overall usefulness of&#13;
     the workshop, received a mean score of 4.26 out of 5.0. Over 90% of the responses were in the&#13;
     upper range of the scale, either 4 or 5, indicating that respondents were highly satisfied with the&#13;
     general framework and organization of the workshop.&#13;
&#13;
  ·  The three-day workshop seemed to have met the stated objectives. Respondent ratings on the&#13;
     achievement of each of the three specific objectives all exceeded 4.0 out of 5.0: providing useful&#13;
     information (mean=4.05); increasing the understanding of the necessary steps to takefor&#13;
     improving their own financial sector reform plans (mean=4.17); and the extent to which they were&#13;
     able to develop useful personal contacts and networks with other participants and instructors&#13;
     during the workshop (mean=4.14). The workshop's overall achievement of announced objectives&#13;
     received a mean score of 4.14, with 83% of the respondents rating either 4 or 5.&#13;
&#13;
  ·  The degree to which respondents felt the workshop was relevant to their current work or&#13;
     functions received one of the highest ratings on the evaluation, 4.19. Responses to the relevance&#13;
     question, however, varied slightly among respondents of different organizational affiliations:&#13;
     representatives from the Central Bank, as well as Securities Exchange Commission, indicated a&#13;
     higher degree of relevance (mean=4.31), than did respondents representing government&#13;
     ministries and agencies (mean=3.93).&#13;
&#13;
  ·  Respondents found the reading materials provided during the workshop particularly useful. This&#13;
     item received the highest rating among all respondents (mean=4.29). Results broken down by&#13;
     professional affiliation also showed variations in the aspects of the workshop that respondents&#13;
     found most beneficial. For example, the most favorable ratings among government participants&#13;
     were given to lecture presentations (mean=4.36), the extent to which respondents improved&#13;
     understanding of the role of the World Bank and other multilateral organizations (mean=4.29),&#13;
     and the improvement in their ability to review their current plan with broader perspective&#13;
     (mean=4.0). For representatives from the Central Banks, lecture presentations (mean=4.44), and&#13;
     the opportunity of identifying necessary steps for improving their action plan (mean=4.25) were of&#13;
     among the highest ratings. Respondents from Security Exchange Commissions found round&#13;
     table discussions (mean=4.31) and the opportunity of networking (mean=4.15) more beneficial&#13;
     than presentation (mean=3.83).&#13;
         o   Some of the items that received relatively lower ratings among all respondents were the&#13;
             extent to which respondents felt the information obtained during the workshop was new&#13;
             (mean=3.37), as well as the extent to which respondents used information obtained from&#13;
             the presentations when participating in the breakout sessions (mean=3.74). A few&#13;
             respondents expressed a sense of dissatisfaction in their written comments with how&#13;
             some breakout sessions had proceeded. They felt that breakout discussions were often&#13;
             difficult since participants were representing countries with different levels of&#13;
             development in the financial systems, and discussions were often diverted by some&#13;
             participants reporting problems of own countries. Another item, the adaptability of the&#13;
             policies discussed in the workshop to respondent country also received a relatively lower&#13;
             rating by all respondents (mean=3.64). While respondents reported one of the key&#13;
             benefits of attending the workshop as having improved the understanding of the&#13;
             necessary steps to take for their countries, they may have felt the policies presented&#13;
             were less appropriate for their countries, or they may have felt less optimistic about the&#13;
             possibility of fully incorporating the presented policies in the existing financial systems of&#13;
             their countries.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Self-Reported Knowledge Assessment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   o   Respondents were asked at the end of the workshop to rate their levels of understanding&#13;
       on key concepts as they perceived them before attending the workshop and after having&#13;
       completed the workshop. Respondents' pre/post self-assessment of their knowledge&#13;
       levels indicated a positive gain of 22% to 41% across all 10 thematic sessions. There&#13;
       were three areas of topics that had a gain of over 40%: "Progress in strengthening the&#13;
       architecture of the international financial system;" "The crisis in emerging markets;" and&#13;
       "Non-bank financial institution development." Respondents' pre-workshop ratings on the&#13;
       three topics, ranging from 2.79 to 2.98, indicated that the items were the least familiar&#13;
       topics for the respondents before the workshop. Their perceived understanding improved&#13;
       substantially after the workshop, ranging from 3.9 to 4.17. On the issue of "Compliance&#13;
       and enforcement with regulations and securities market development," by contrast,&#13;
       respondent knowledge was the lowest before the workshop (mean=2.78) and the topic&#13;
       remained the least familiar area for respondents after the workshop among all topics&#13;
       (mean=3.41). The gain was the smallest of the 10 topics (22%).&#13;
   o   Post-workshop ratings of self-assessed levels of knowledge were among the highest on&#13;
       issues of "East Asian financial crisis and effective supervision" (mean=4.24) and&#13;
       "Financial regulation and enforcement in emerging markets" (mean=4.05). Respondents&#13;
       had an above 3.0 pre-workshop rating on the two topics, suggesting that they had been&#13;
       fairly familiar with the topics before attending the workshop (mean=3.24 and 3.10,&#13;
       respectively). Their participation in the workshop seemed to have helped further increase&#13;
       respondents' confidence on the two subjects (both had a gain of 31%). The proportion of&#13;
       respondents selecting either 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale after having completed the&#13;
       workshop was over 95% on "East Asian" issues and 85% on "Financial regulation"&#13;
       issues.&#13;
   o   Results of pre/post knowledge levels should be interpreted carefully, since they&#13;
       measured respondent impression of their achievement and not actual learning gains.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Comments from Respondents&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   o   Written comments and suggestion were collected from 35 respondents. Results&#13;
       indicated that the respondents were highly satisfied with the quality of instructors'&#13;
       presentations and their answers to questions from participants. At the same time, a&#13;
       number of respondents made specific requests to workshop instructors. They included:&#13;
       1) that more country-specific examples relevant to workshop participants be presented&#13;
       (N=8); and 2) that presentation style be improved by using better visual aids and&#13;
       illustration, being more engaging with participants, and encouraging participants to ask&#13;
       questions (N=12). Several respondents commented on the usefulness of the round table&#13;
       and general discussion periods, and requested that more time should be spent on these&#13;
       participatory activities (N=7).&#13;
   o   A majority of the respondents who completed the questionnaire expressed a clear&#13;
       intention of applying the experience and knowledge obtained from the workshop to their&#13;
       work (N=33). Some of the key areas or plans for utilization mentioned by respondents&#13;
       included the following: using experience and knowledge in preparing policy papers and&#13;
       reports; modifying existing conceptual framework of the financial systems or improving&#13;
       current legislative and supervision activities in their countries; closely monitoring&#13;
       developments in the financial sector in view of preventing potential crisis phenomena;&#13;
       and sharing information obtained in the workshop with colleagues at home to reflect on&#13;
       day-to-day activities.&#13;

            The Governance, Regulation and Finance
            Division (WBIGF) of the World Bank Institute, in
            collaboration with the Organization for Economic Cooperation
            and Development (OECD) centre for private sector
            development, conducted a policy workshop on financial
            systems reform: crisis management and supervision in
            Istanbul, Turkey, from June 15 to June 17, 1999. The purpose
            of the workshop was to provide senior policy makers in
            transition economies in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA)
            region with an opportunity to discuss issues of the recent
            financial crises in Russia and Asia, and assist them in
            formulating appropriate banking and financial system
            policies for their own countries. There were three major
            objectives for the workshop: 1) providing participants with
            the empirical findings and policy implications on the recent
            financial crises, in order to allow them to find useful
            information that is relevant to their own financial reform
            agenda; 2) helping them to determine practical steps and
            strategies to formulate and implement policy priorities on
            the reform agenda; and 3) providing a dialogue forum to
            exchange information and build networks among participants
            and instructors.
