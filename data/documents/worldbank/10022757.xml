        Box 3. Operating Experience of Processing Facilities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        In 2000, a total of 88 medium- and large-scale plants were being planned or were in existence.10 More than 50 were&#13;
        composting plants with a total processing capacity of around 15,000 tons per day. There were four to five large-scale&#13;
        vermicomposting plants. Twelve biomethanation plants had been planned but only two had been implemented. There was&#13;
        one large mass burn incinerator for energy recovery, but this was not being used. Of the five refuse-derived fuel (RDF) plants&#13;
        that had been constructed, only two were in operation. The status of these plants six years later was found to be that&#13;
        30 percent were in operation, 20 percent of them had been closed down, and 50 percent of those that were planned had&#13;
        not, in fact, been constructed. As part of the study, detailed analyses (including field visits) were done for nine treatment and&#13;
        disposal facilities that included composting, biomethanation, and RDF plants located across the country.11 Field visits were&#13;
        undertaken as part of the study during the period October 2005 to February 2006. Some were still operating, though&#13;
        mostly not at full capacity, but others had been closed before the end of their intended lifetime and some had actually been&#13;
        dismantled and removed. The lessons learned from these nine cases were summarized as follows:&#13;
&#13;
        · Protection of the environment and public health was not being addressed since untreated waste and residues were&#13;
               still being dumped in an unsatisfactory way.&#13;
&#13;
        · Rapid wear and tear of equipment led to high maintenance costs.&#13;
&#13;
        · Seasonal and climatic factors (such as the seasonal demand for compost and the low demand for waste heat in hot&#13;
               climates) reduced the financial viability of some processes.&#13;
&#13;
        · The inability or unwillingness of urban local bodies to contribute to the costs of the processing, coupled with an&#13;
               overestimation of the revenue streams (from the sale of compost and energy), led to financial problems.&#13;
&#13;
        · The lack of operator control on the quality and quantity of the feedstock (the incoming waste) caused operational shortfalls.&#13;
&#13;
        · Inadequate allowance was made for the sensitivity of biological and microbiological processes. This is particularly&#13;
               significant for vermicomposting and in the anaerobic processes used in biomethanation, in which changes in&#13;
               temperature and feedstock can disrupt bacterial action.&#13;
&#13;
        · Large-scale plants were generally less reliable than small-scale operations, but the overall impact of small-scale&#13;
               operations on quantities requiring disposal was minimal.&#13;
&#13;
        · Odor emissions led to plant closures.&#13;
&#13;
        · Deficiencies in transparency and in public consultation during project development led to subsequent public opposition.&#13;
&#13;
        · Inadequate contract management (in terms of operational and financial control) was blamed for some difficulties.&#13;
&#13;
        · The importance of site-specific factors (such as location and markets) was not given sufficient attention.&#13;
&#13;
        Among the cases studied, one concerned a sanitary landfill facility that had been constructed but had not been used,&#13;
        and was deteriorating. The incoming waste was not being placed in the landfill because there was no effective treatment&#13;
        system for the waste, and the Municipal Solid Waste Rules were interpreted to mean that the mixed waste (that is,&#13;
        including biodegradable waste) should not be disposed of in this facility. Instead, the waste was being dumped in a very&#13;
        unsatisfactory way on unprepared ground adjacent to the facility. The result was continuing environmental pollution&#13;
        coupled with the wastage of a significant investment.&#13;
&#13;
        Additional information on the Hyderabad RDF plant (from a CPCB presentation): Located in Gandamguda village on&#13;
        10 acres of land, the plant has been working since December 1999. The plant's processing capacity is 500 tpd (tons per&#13;
        day) of municipal solid waste in three shifts. Currently operating in only one shift, it was producing only 30 tpd of RDF.&#13;

achievement of the primary objectives&#13;
of protecting the environment and&#13;
public health. Landfills are essential for&#13;
backstopping." (Asit Nema)&#13;
&#13;
The results of this study make for hard&#13;
reading. However, we need to know the&#13;
truth about difficulties that have been&#13;
faced so that decisions and strategies&#13;
can be based on realities rather than&#13;
misplaced assumptions. There is an&#13;
urgent need for more studies of&#13;
this kind and for their widespread&#13;
distribution among decisionmakers&#13;
and engineers within India.&#13;
&#13;
Given the funds being allocated under&#13;
the Twelfth Finance Commission and&#13;
Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban&#13;
Renewal Mission, it becomes even more&#13;
critical to internalize lessons from past&#13;
experience and invest in projects that&#13;
are sustainable in the long term.&#13;

Obstacles to Safe&#13;
&#13;
and Sanitary Disposal&#13;
&#13;
Even when there are effective and&#13;
&#13;
reliable systems that are processing&#13;
&#13;
all the treatable or recyclable fraction&#13;
&#13;
of the waste (and this is unlikely to be&#13;
&#13;
achieved in India in the short term),&#13;
&#13;
there will still be a need for sanitary&#13;
&#13;
landfills to dispose of rejects, residues&#13;
&#13;
(from treatment processes), and&#13;
&#13;
nonbiodegradable material. Therefore,&#13;
                                             The sanitary landfilling facility (top) is not in use because there is no treatment plant to process the waste and the&#13;
whatever the treatment system, a&#13;
                                             use of the site has been prevented on the grounds that the waste contains biodegradable material. As a result&#13;
sanitary landfill is an integral component&#13;
                                             the waste is being dumped in an unsanitary way, as shown above, and the landfill facility appears to be&#13;

these sizes.                                     to be mistaken for open dumps.                  (Raghu Rama Swamy)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Box 4. The Size of a Landfill Site&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Some sites that have been acquired appear to be much too small, the area requirement being based on the assumption&#13;
  that only a small fraction of the waste will need to be landfilled (after all the waste has been processed and only inert material&#13;
  that has no recycling potential is left), and that a lifetime of 10 years or less is sufficient. Sites for landfills should be much&#13;
  larger for the following reasons:&#13;
&#13;
  · Landfill sites will be needed for the foreseeable future, so it is wise to acquire a site that will last for at least 20-25 years,&#13;
     especially since the cost of acquiring the land is low compared to the total costs of the site. If a new disposal&#13;
     technology replaces landfilling during this period, the site can be handed over to other purposes.&#13;
&#13;
  · The facility can be constructed incrementally. Since construction is usually the major cost (see Table 1) new cells can be&#13;
     constructed as they are needed. It is cost-effective to concentrate landfilling operations on one large site rather than&#13;
     using many small sites, as will be discussed later.&#13;
&#13;
  · Not all of the site area can be used for landfilling. Space is needed for a buffer zone around the site (to hide operations&#13;
     and prevent nuisance to, and opposition from, neighbors), for roads, parking, and administration, for storing cover&#13;
     material, and for leachate storage or treatment.&#13;
&#13;
  · It cannot be assumed that only nonbiodegradable waste will be needed to be landfilled throughout the lifetime of the&#13;
     site, even though this is desirable and required by law. Treatment plants are shut down temporarily for many reasons, or&#13;
     there may be other disruptions in operation. Delays in the implementation of treatment plants should not cause delays in&#13;
     implementing safe and sanitary disposal. Landfills are robust and able to accept large changes in the quantities and&#13;
     characteristics of the incoming waste. This flexibility and robustness should not be constrained by inadequate facility&#13;
     sizes or other flawed assumptions.&#13;
&#13;
  · As will be discussed later, there are advantages to a regional approach to landfilling, in which waste from a number of&#13;
     neighboring towns and cities is disposed of in one landfill. Allowance should be made for the receiving of waste from&#13;
     additional communities.&#13;
&#13;
  · Rapid economic growth leads to increases in waste quantities and changes in waste composition. These changes&#13;
     cannot be accurately predicted, so allowance for them must be made beforehand.&#13;

Key Principles&#13;
&#13;
"Each landfill has a site-specific design.&#13;
Detailed engineering is important."&#13;
(Manoj Datta)&#13;
&#13;
The scope of this document does not&#13;
permit a detailed discussion of the&#13;
design features and techniques of&#13;
sanitary landfilling. Nevertheless, the&#13;
basic objectives of sanitary landfilling&#13;
can be summarized as:&#13;
&#13;
· Averting water pollution.&#13;
&#13;
· Preventing the air pollution that&#13;
    results from burning.&#13;
                                             This landfill cell has been lined with an impermeable plastic liner so that underground water will not be&#13;
&#13;
· Minimizing any nuisance to                 polluted when solid wastes are placed in the cell.&#13;

    birds, and insects).&#13;
                                                   Water pollution. A major reason for investing in sanitary landfilling is to&#13;
&#13;
· Reducing hazards and nuisance to                 prevent the pollution of water resources. Pollution from landfills cannot be&#13;
&#13;
    people working on the site.                    reversed by standard potable water treatment technologies, and effects may&#13;
                                                   persist in underground aquifers for a century or more. Landfills, therefore, are&#13;
· Using the land in an economical way              either sited in areas where the natural geology provides protection against&#13;
    and operating vehicles and machines            water pollution, or are constructed in such a way that polluted water that has&#13;
    in an efficient way.                           been in contact with the waste is prevented from contaminating the outside&#13;
                                                   environment. Ideally both means of protection are used together. In all cases,&#13;
In addition to these basic objectives,&#13;
                                                   the polluted water should be collected and treated so that it can be released&#13;
and especially for larger landfills, are&#13;

The regional approach entails several autonomous urban administrations&#13;
joining together to use one facility. One sanitary landfill may serve two, three&#13;
or even 20 cities and towns.&#13;

&#13;
  Box 8. Reasons for Economies of Scale in Sanitary Landfilling&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The cost of landfilling 1 ton of solid waste in a large landfill can be expected to be less than the cost of achieving the same&#13;
  results in a small landfill for the following reasons:&#13;
&#13;
  ·   Larger sites are cheaper to construct per square meter than several smaller sites with the same total area because the&#13;
      necessary infrastructure that must be provided on all sites (weighbridge, site roads, among other things) can be used&#13;
      more intensively on a larger site. Moreover, since the ratio of perimeter to area is lower for a large site, the proportional&#13;
      spending on perimeter fencing and buffer zones is less for a large site.&#13;
&#13;
  ·   For a given side slope (determined by considerations of slope stability, aesthetics, and ease of construction) a greater&#13;
      height can be reached if the dimensions of the base area are greater. This allows more waste to be placed on each&#13;
      square meter in the parts of larger landfill sites where the depth is greater.&#13;
&#13;
  ·   Equipment (such as bulldozers and other specialized machinery) can be used more intensively on a large site, and the&#13;
      greater workload allows specialized machines to be employed on larger sites.&#13;
&#13;
      The use of specialized machines allows greater efficiency. For example, a small site might be operated by a small&#13;
      tracked vehicle with a combination bucket that allows it to bulldoze waste and spread cover soil, but it does not&#13;
      compact the waste very significantly and may move slowly.&#13;
&#13;
      A large site might have a landfill compactor that compacts the waste to a higher density, a bulldozer for earthmoving,&#13;
      and a wheeled loader that can load and distribute cover material very efficiently.&#13;

  These data are based on small samples, but illustrate trends that have a theoretical basis. As a rule of thumb, Bhatnagar&#13;
  suggested that sanitary landfills require a contributing population of 800,000 to one million people for economical operation.&#13;
  Less than half of India's urban population lives in communities of this size. More than 98 percent of the urban communities are&#13;
  smaller. Hence there is a clear need for urban local bodies to join together.&#13;

     Box 13. Some Warnings about Waste Data&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Much effort has been wasted in collecting data on waste composition (the percentage of biodegradable material, plastic,&#13;
     paper, and so on). This wastage of effort can be attributed to:&#13;
&#13;
     ·   Such data are usually collected with little thought of the purpose that the information will be put to. For example,&#13;
         if it is desired to examine the potential for recycling plastic, it is not enough to determine the gross percentage of&#13;
         plastic, but it may be necessary to separate the various polymers, separate molded plastic from plastic film, and&#13;
         choose carefully the point in the waste management chain at which the analysis should be carried out. If it is desired to&#13;
         examine the feasibility of incineration, accurate studies are needed of moisture content and of composition after&#13;
         informal waste picking, at different times of the year.&#13;
&#13;
     ·   Composition studies are often used to indicate the potential for composting. However, the potential for composting is&#13;
         more often determined by the amount of biodegradable waste that is collected separately from other wastes (and&#13;
         therefore not contaminated by glass, plastic, and so on) and by the potential market for the product.&#13;
&#13;
     ·   Waste composition results are strongly influenced by seasonal factors (weather and availability of fresh fruit and&#13;
         vegetables) and so should be carried out over a period that covers all seasons. Waste generation data are often&#13;
         unreliable and inadequate, since they may not take account of seasonal differences and waste picking, and do not&#13;
         consider all streams of waste--domestic, institutional, commercial, market, street, industrial, and so forth. The&#13;
         most useful data for management of sanitary landfills are the weights of incoming waste and of cover material, so a&#13;
         weighbridge is essential. It is also useful to determine the in-situ density of the waste by surveying the site at intervals&#13;
         of six months or a year. There is a tendency to accept any available data without questioning its accuracy or reliability.&#13;
         Inaccurate data can lead to major mistakes, delays, and the waste of large sums of money.&#13;

&#13;
Definitions and Data Notes&#13;
&#13;
Biomethanation&#13;
&#13;
This is a process used to produce methane gas, which can be used as a fuel, by means of bacteria that feed on the waste when&#13;
there is little or no oxygen present. A more general term is anaerobic digestion. The conditions of the process (amount of water,&#13;
temperature, and characteristics of the waste) must all be carefully controlled.&#13;
&#13;
Chain&#13;
&#13;
The chain of solid waste management operations can, in broad terms, be taken to include the following stages: generation,&#13;
storage, collection, treatment (or processing), and disposal.&#13;
&#13;
CPCB&#13;
&#13;
Central Pollution Control Board&#13;
&#13;
Crore&#13;
&#13;
10 million&#13;
&#13;
Disposal&#13;
&#13;
Disposal is the last stage of solid waste management. The only satisfactory method of disposal involves placing the remaining&#13;
residues into an engineered receiving area and minimizing their contact with, and impact on, the external environment. This process&#13;
is known as sanitary or engineered landfilling.&#13;
&#13;
Dumping&#13;
&#13;
Crude or open dumping refers to the unloading of waste without taking care to minimizing pollution, utilizing the land area well, or&#13;
restoring the site when disposal operations cease. In such situations waste is often burnt, causing serious air pollution. The word&#13;
`landfilling' should not be used to describe such operations.&#13;
&#13;
Economy of scale&#13;
&#13;
An economy of scale is demonstrated when the unit cost (such as the cost of disposal of 1 ton of waste) is less for a larger&#13;
operation than for an equivalent but smaller operation, for reasons that are linked to the size of the operation.&#13;
&#13;
Hectare&#13;
&#13;
10,000 square meters or 2.471 acres&#13;
&#13;
Lakh&#13;
&#13;
100,000&#13;
&#13;
Landfill&#13;
&#13;
Referring to a sanitary landfill, which is an engineered secure waste disposal facility incorporating environmental safeguards such as&#13;
liner, leachate control systems, gas collection systems, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
MSW(M)&#13;
&#13;
Municipal solid waste (management). Municipal solid waste is generally taken to include domestic, institutional, commercial, and&#13;
street wastes. Agricultural wastes and hazardous solid wastes from industries and hospitals are excluded from this category,&#13;
and construction and demolition waste is also usually excluded.&#13;
&#13;
Processing&#13;
&#13;
Processing and treatment are considered to have the same meaning in this publication.&#13;

                                                                                                 Implementing Integrated Solid Waste&#13;
                                                                                                 Management Systems in India:&#13;
                                                                                                 Moving Towards the Regional Approach&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RDF&#13;
&#13;
Refuse-derived fuel, which is made from solid waste and is used as a substitute for coal in boilers. It may be in the form of short,&#13;
extruded cylinders or as loose material, known as `fluff'.&#13;
&#13;
Resource recovery&#13;
&#13;
Resource recovery embraces all means of gaining some economic benefit from waste. This may involve reusing items in the&#13;
waste in their original form, processing them to make new materials or products, or burning the waste or a product from the&#13;
waste to gain energy, which may be converted into electrical power.&#13;
&#13;
Rs&#13;
&#13;
Indian Rupees or INR (US$1 = INR 40.46, as of September 7, 2007).&#13;
&#13;
Solid waste&#13;
&#13;
Any item or material that is no longer of interest to the person who was responsible for it and that is not discharged through a&#13;
pipe or directly into the air. (Laws and contracts may provide different definitions.) The ownership of solid waste at any stage or&#13;
time can be an important issue in the context of recycling and legal liability.&#13;
&#13;
Solid waste management&#13;
&#13;
All activities that aim to minimize undesirable impacts of solid wastes and to derive some benefit from these wastes.&#13;
&#13;
Tons&#13;
&#13;
see `tpd'&#13;
&#13;
tpd&#13;
&#13;
Tons per day. For the purposes of this report, the difference between the avoirdupois ton (2,240 lb) and the metric ton or tonne&#13;
(1,000 kg, equivalent to 2,205 lb) is of no significance. The short ton (2,000 lb) is rarely heard of outside the United States.&#13;
The megagram (Mg) is the same as the tonne.&#13;
&#13;
Treatment&#13;
&#13;
Waste treatment is taken to mean any process that changes the nature of waste in order to gain some benefit from it (such as&#13;
energy recovery or using it as an input in a manufacturing process) or reduces the costs, risks or pollution associated with&#13;
subsequent handling. Most treatment processes produce residues that require disposal. In other words, treatment is rarely the&#13;
last stage in the solid waste management chain.&#13;

            Implementing integrated solid waste
            management systems in India : moving towards the regional approach
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This document is intended for decision
            makers who are concerned with reducing the pollution and
            health hazards that are caused by the uncontrolled disposal
            of thousands of tons of waste each day in open dumps. It
            will also be helpful for decision makers who are concerned
            with urban governance and urban management. While it does
            contain some technical information, the messages can be
            easily understood by those with an interest in municipal
            issues but no formal training in scientific or technical
            disciplines. The challenges of safe disposal of municipal
            solid waste (MSW) were deliberated on at two workshops held
            in January 2007, under the auspices of the Ministry of Urban
            Development with the participation of a wide range of
            experts and practitioners, and the support of Water and
            Sanitation Program-South Asia (of the World Bank). This
            document echoes the opinions expressed in these workshops.
            Information provided by the participants touched upon many
            critical issues. This publication answers questions such as:
            1) to what extent are current solid waste management
            practices in India threatening our health and environment?
            2) What are the reasons for the current state of affairs? 3)
            What are the strengths and weaknesses of current strategies
            for disposing solid waste? 4) What are the economically and
            environmentally sustainable options for disposing waste from
            both large and small communities?
