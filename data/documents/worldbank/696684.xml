Technical Annex p.1 of 26&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
General&#13;
1.    Prior to the hostilities, the transport system of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) was&#13;
organized to meet the needs of the former Yugoslavia. Inland transport was provided by a road&#13;
system (including 8,600 km of main and regional roads). As with other sectors, the ability of the&#13;
transport sector to function has been seriously affected by the hostilities. Virtually all parts of the&#13;
transport system have been damaged, either as a result of direct targeting, by the movements of&#13;
military vehicles on roads which were not designed to carry heavy traffic, or by lack of&#13;
maintenance and spare parts for more than four years.&#13;
Scope of Emergency&#13;
2.    Roads: The past four years of hostilities have affected the entire road network. Virtually&#13;
no road maintenance has been carried out and this combined with military traffic has caused&#13;
significant deterioration in road pavements. Roads either near or used as bypasses around&#13;
shifting confrontation lines have suffered the most with some sections of regional and local roads&#13;
now requiring complete reconstruction. Also roads used as deviations around downed bridges&#13;
(e.g. around the Visoko bridge) are breaking up. While some sections of main roads show only&#13;
superficial signs of apparent wear, they are well past due periodic maintenance and visible&#13;
distress can be expected soon with a more rapid deterioration setting in quickly. While the entire&#13;
network will need attention in the next five to seven years, about 28% of the main and regional&#13;
network will require more immediate attention within the next three years to remedy both&#13;
damage and the more severe effects of maintenance neglect. Damage estimates are based on&#13;
visual surveys and, without neglecting immediate attention to urgent works, will be&#13;
supplemented by technical investigations to confirm or revise the proposed repair treatment.&#13;
3.    Bridges: Bridges are prime strategic targets in military operations and, in the last four&#13;
years, about 70 bridges have been damaged with about 25 of these made impassable. Many of&#13;
these bridges are on main routes with the principal crossings now being maintained through&#13;
makeshift deviations or single lane military bridges. Although, for some impassable bridges, both&#13;
part or all of the superstructure and, in some cases, piers and/or pier heads have been destroyed,&#13;
many have the piers and abutments still standing and most reconstruction will be confined to&#13;
replacement of the decks. Demolition of the damaged sections and downed decks will form a&#13;
significant part of the reconstruction cost. Areas around and beneath some of the damaged&#13;
bridges have been mined.&#13;
4.    Sava/Una river bridges: All ten bridges (7 road, 2 road/rail and 1 rail) connecting the&#13;
Republic of Croatia with BH across the Sava and Una rivers are now impassable. Some have&#13;
been completely destroyed while others have one or two spans cut. At least one of the destroyed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex p.2 of 26&#13;
bridges is still mined. While one or two ferries are operating and IFOR has constructed two&#13;
pontoon bridges near Orasje, most road and all rail traffic is virtually cut off from the rest of&#13;
Europe.&#13;
5.    Construction and maintenance equipment: Many items of construction and&#13;
maintenance equipment were damaged, destroyed or purloined during the hostilities. Much of&#13;
the remainder has suffered from neglect due to an inability to use the equipment or through lack&#13;
of spare parts. Shortage of this equipment now severely hampers reconstruction of the transport&#13;
system. Of particularly high priority is the need for asphalt plants and quarries to supply material&#13;
for the repair of both the road network and city streets.&#13;
6.    Railways: The railway system was severely damaged and, within the Federation, with&#13;
the exception of some minor lengths, is not functioning. Two bridges on the main line between&#13;
Ploce and Sarajevo and one between Sarajevo and Zenica have been cut and equipment&#13;
damaged or stolen. Some traction and rolling stock has also been damaged, but most is sitting in&#13;
unknown condition, in isolated pockets. A US$8.6 million EU initiative is underway to reopen&#13;
the main trunk line between Sarajevo and Ploce for about two pairs of trains per day. In the RS,&#13;
the line from Banja Luka west to Prijedor and to the east is functioning but with light traffic and&#13;
no connection outside RS. The EU and Germany are involved in the railway reconstruction&#13;
program in a substantial way and it is suggested that they continue to take the lead in this sub-&#13;
sector. IFOR is currently undertaking a detailed survey of the rail infrastructure.&#13;
7.    Airports: The runway, taxiways and aprons at Sarajevo airport are severely cracked and&#13;
most of the air traffic control equipment has been destroyed. In addition, most mobile&#13;
equipment, the lighting system and airport buildings have also been damaged. The airport is&#13;
operating but with military equipment and under the management of IFOR. While UNPROFOR&#13;
has carried out urgent maintenance works to the runway, taxiway and aprons, major repairs have&#13;
been precluded by the proximity of the confrontation line. For the remainder of the airports,&#13;
Banja Luka is said to be operational, Tuzla is operating as an IFOR base, and Bihac and Mostar&#13;
are damaged and not in operation.&#13;
8.    Ports: The port of Ploce, located in the Republic of Croatia, was bombed during the&#13;
hostilities, the oil terminal shut down and berths requires urgent rehabilitation and possibly&#13;
expansion. Nevertheless, the port is functioning mainly for military purposes and humanitarian&#13;
aid, although at a much reduced throughput than before hostilities. Port improvements are being&#13;
considered from financing under a proposed Reconstruction Loan to the Republic of Croatia.&#13;
9.    Urban transport: The public transport system in Sarajevo is barely functioning. Two&#13;
tram lines have been minimally repaired, but the other means of public transport (buses, mini-&#13;
buses and trolley buses) require extensive repairs to vehicles, installations and the workshops.&#13;
Public transportation vehicles and installations in other cities (Tuzla, Zenica, Mostar and Bihac)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex p.3. of 26&#13;
are also reported to have been damaged but less so than in Sarajevo, or run down due to the&#13;
embargo (Banja Luka, Bijeljina, Doboj and Trebinje).&#13;
10.   Institutions: Most institutions have suffered loss of staff and also premises and there is&#13;
little budgetary support for their operations. The RDs have been particularly hard hit with much&#13;
reduced staff and no permanent premises. Also, contractors' and consultants' staff were&#13;
mobilized into the armed forces and some have gone abroad. Further, much of the professional&#13;
engineering equipment was destroyed during the hostilities and currently funds are so limited&#13;
such that institutions have difficulty in obtaining even the simplest supplies to run their offices.&#13;
B. DONOR'S RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
11.   In December 1995, in a joint effort with the Government and donor community, the&#13;
Bank assisted in preparing a reconstruction program that envisages funding requirements of&#13;
about US$5 billion over the next three to four years. Within that program, the funding&#13;
requirements for transport are estimated at US$698 million to be committed over three years&#13;
with first year requirements of US$301 million.&#13;
12.   The transport program (the Program) was based on a strategy that reconstruction of the&#13;
transport network is essential for the recovery of economic activity and the unification of the&#13;
country. Critical links should be restored without delay including those supporting national and&#13;
intemational traffic. However, other investment priorities will be influenced, more than in other&#13;
sectors, by the implementation of the Dayton Agreement and possible changed traffic patterns.&#13;
Population relocation may also generate specific local transport requirements. Agreements&#13;
between BH and the Republic of Croatia, and between BH and the Federal Republic of&#13;
Yugoslavia will also significantly affect transport demand, particularly for road and rail&#13;
international traffic. Significant short term traffic is already being generated by IFOR with&#13;
demands on the road, port and, when open, the rail system. Prehostilities traffic pattems are well&#13;
documented; however, given the foregoing, a cautious approach is recommended for medium&#13;
and long term investments. Under the project, assistance will be provided to the Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina Ministry of Foreign Trade and Intemational Communications (BHMTC) to set up&#13;
a planning unit to monitor the development of transport pattems and traffic and to produce&#13;
strategic plans for the short and medium term (para 36 (xv)).&#13;
13.   With the uncertainty of demand, the underlying strategy of the Program will be to&#13;
concentrate first on transport systems which are going to be needed under any scenario, and plan&#13;
in a flexible way to adapt to new information. The most important transport links include the&#13;
north-south corridor of Ploce-Sarajevo-Zenica-Tuzla and possibly fiirther north, inter-city main&#13;
and regional roads, roads running east-west in the south, Sarajevo airport, public transport and&#13;
some street works, particularly in Sarajevo. In addition, there are new links required to ensure&#13;
freedom of movement. The most urgent needs are proposed to be started in the first year, with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex p.4 of 26&#13;
other important items included in the second and third years subject to the findings of feasibility&#13;
studies.&#13;
14.   Both the Bank and EBRD expect to play an important role in assisting with coordination&#13;
in the transport sector and facilitating dialogue between the various parties. Both institutions are&#13;
prepared to support the coordination function through the establishment of a coordinating body&#13;
such as an expert commission or corporation for the sector (see Annex 10 of the Dayton&#13;
Agreement). With respect to the international bridges across the Sava and Una rivers,&#13;
discussions have been taking place whereby the Republic of Croatia and BH would share the&#13;
cost of reconstruction. Accordingly, the project includes technical assistance for a quick review&#13;
of these bridges with recommendations and for recommendations on desirable bridge&#13;
intemational agreements (para 36 (iii)). Concerning the Port of Ploce, an agreement reached in&#13;
1994 (the Washington Agreement) envisaged free transit and free movement of goods through&#13;
Ploce. It is reasonable to expect that the necessary agreements or other provisions should be put&#13;
in place within a short period of time, and that investments in the port to be included in the&#13;
proposed Bank-financed emergency project to the Republic of Croatia would depend on the&#13;
successful conclusion of such arrangements.&#13;
15.   The First Year Program (FYP) which is similar to that prepared in December 1995&#13;
(see para 11) covers those components that are needed being most urgently, with other&#13;
components included in the second and third year subject to the findings of feasibility&#13;
studies. The FYP will be implemented through two projects. The first, this emergency&#13;
project, comprises works to overcome the most serious transport system constraints and&#13;
amounts to US$149.0 million. The project includes such items as repairs to failing roads,&#13;
reconstruction of downed bridges, opening Sarajevo airport to scheduled services,&#13;
improvement to rail services and providing initial support to reestablishing urban transport&#13;
services - principally in Sarajevo. Preparation work for a proposed second project&#13;
(Transport II) are also included. With an estimated cost of about US$150.0 million,&#13;
Transport II will complete the FYP and will likely include works requiring more detailed&#13;
preparation including major road construction, some or all of the remaining downed Sava&#13;
and Una bridges, further support to rail and urban transport, and support to bringing road&#13;
maintenance activities up to an efficient level. Transport II will continue the modernization&#13;
of the transport system and support increasing efficiency through privatization.&#13;
C. FIRST YEAR PROGRAM AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
The program&#13;
16.   Objective: The objective of the FYP is to reconstruct and repair urgent high priority&#13;
links and services in the transport system - particularly roads, bridges, tunnels, the railways,&#13;
Sarajevo airport and urban transit, and to provide equipment and assistance to prepare,&#13;
implement and maintain the program works and to provide a framework for the future&#13;
development and management of the country's transport system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex p.5. of 26&#13;
17.   The FYP includes the following: (i) the rehabilitation of about 375km of main and&#13;
regional roads; (ii) repairs to tunnels; (iii) reconstruction of about 30 road bridges; (iv)&#13;
construction and maintenance equipment; (v) provision of asphalt plants and quarries; (vi)&#13;
equipment for the railways, including telecommunications equipment, spares for rolling&#13;
stock etc.; (vii) rehabilitation of Sarajevo airport; (viii) support for urban transport including&#13;
the supply of buses and parts and urgent repairs to urban streets and traffic systems; (ix) the&#13;
supply of fuel and bitumen; and (x) technical assistance for project preparation,&#13;
implementation and support to transport institutions. The project is a slice of this FYP and its&#13;
relationship to the FYP and the proposed Transport Project H is shown below.&#13;

This latest FYP, shown in Table 1, varies slightly from the original first year program prepared in&#13;
December 1995. Better cost estimates are now available, the port of Ploce improvement may be&#13;
financed through financings to the Republic of Croatia, and the Gorazde road preparation has&#13;
been added. Further modifications are likely over time.&#13;

The Project Description&#13;
18.   Objective: The objective of the project is identical with that of the Program (para&#13;
16), namely to reconstruct and repair high priority links in the transport system. The&#13;
components comprise mostly those items which that are adequately funded, and of top&#13;
priority, preparation is such that all contracts will be awarded in 1996 and, for the most&#13;
part, disbursements will be made the same year.&#13;
19.   Roads: The project includes those sections of high priority roads where only a minimal&#13;
to medium level of design work is required. The total of sections is approximately 180 km and&#13;
includes works to the Ml 7 (the main road from the port of Ploce through Sarajevo to Zenica&#13;
and routes west of Mostar). The Federation road program is shown in Table 3(a) (page 60) and&#13;
the RS Indicative Program in Annex I, Table A (page 30). The programs will be subject to&#13;
detailed review with consequent possible revisions and proposed major works will be subject to&#13;
confirmation/revision through feasibility studies.&#13;
20.   Bridges: About twenty-one concrete and composite steel/concrete bridges are included&#13;
for repair or reconstruction together with some steel modular bridging for high-priority&#13;
crossings. Modular bridging will be sited to aUlow eventual reconstruction of the bridges in 1997&#13;
or 1998. For the most part, bridges will be reconstructed similar to the original bridge designs&#13;
and their loading will be according to DIN standards. See Table 3 (b) (page 61) for project&#13;
works and Annex I, Table B (page 31) for RS Indicative Program. Work should commence on&#13;
two critical bridges in March 1996 (para 53).&#13;
21.   Sava river bridges: The project includes a study of the work required and priorities to&#13;
restore adequate road and rail communication between BH and the Republic of Croatia. The&#13;
study also includes assistance in formulating the necessary international agreements to manage&#13;
the reconstruction and operation of the crossings. In the meantime, the project includes the&#13;
reconstruction of the Brcko rail and Orasje road bridges and study and design of the more&#13;
critical of the remaining bridges identified by the above study.&#13;
22.   Construction and maintenance equipment: The project includes the procurement of a&#13;
variety of construction and maintenance equipment. The provision of this equipment is a&#13;
continuation of equipment supply begun under the Emergency Recovery Project which includes&#13;
US$11.1 million of construction equipment. The equipment will be for use both by contractors&#13;
and the RD's road maintenance organizations which will be provided with spare parts and&#13;
appropriate workshop equipment. Some minor adjustments may be made in requirements when&#13;
access permits a more detailed survey. Equipment used principally for regular maintenance will&#13;
be passed to RD maintenance organizations free of charge. Equipment used for contract&#13;
maintenance works and construction will be passed to companies under the following&#13;
arrangements:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Technical Annex p.7. of 26&#13;
A: Eligibility: The company must be a genuine autonomous joint stock or private company with&#13;
accounts kept following an acceptable practice;&#13;
B: Terms: Hire/purchase with payments calculated on 5% interest for seven years with an initial&#13;
two years grace period;&#13;
C: Equipment Location: Equipment may not be used outside of BH during the two years grace&#13;
period.&#13;
For project equipment, see Table 3 (c) (page 62) and Annex I, Table C (page 32) for RS&#13;
Indicative Program.&#13;
23.   Railway Equipment: The project also includes provision of equipment and materials&#13;
for the railway infrastructure which will complement the assistance underway by the EU and will&#13;
reopen the main line Ploce-Sarajevo for 6-7 pairs of trains per day, and lines to Zenica and&#13;
Vares. The equipment to be provided includes that required for track repair, repairs to the&#13;
electrical and telecommunication systems, and spare parts for locomotives, wagons and&#13;
passenger cars. The project will also provide equipment and tools to assist with the rehabilitation&#13;
of rail bridges. The list of needed equipment is attached in Table 3 (f) (pages 65-67).&#13;
24.   Sarajevo Airport: The works would cover the safety-related rehabilitation of the&#13;
Sarajevo Airport in order to provide adequate standards to reestablish commercial air services.&#13;
The emphasis is on a coordinated approach which will involve additional site surveys (see Annex&#13;
II), a review of design work underway on the runway, preliminary design of infrastructure and&#13;
the terminal building and identification of needs for navigational aids. EBRD is taking the lead in&#13;
preparing and implementing this component.&#13;
25.   Buses: About 96 urban transit buses will be procured for the cities and towns of the&#13;
Federation (75 buses) and Republica Sprska (21 buses). The buses will be 18m articulated 135&#13;
passengers models, 12m, 80 to 100 passengers models and 7m-9m, with 25-50 passengers&#13;
models for Sarajevo. The urban transit buses will be provided to the urban bus companies on&#13;
terms which should be not more generous than the correspondent donor funding. The project&#13;
also includes spare-parts for buses, repairs to workshops and workshop equipment. Details of&#13;
allocations to cities and towns is given in Tables 3 (e) (page 64) and Annex I (page 34). The EU&#13;
is taking the lead in this component.&#13;
26.   Street Safety: The project includes the provision of urban street safety equipment&#13;
including traffic lights, sign manufacturing equipment, and equipment for the more urgent street&#13;
repairs.&#13;
27.   Trams and Trolley Buses: The project includes spares and equipment to rehabilitate&#13;
the tram system and to restart the trolley buses on a limited emergency basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex p.8 of 26&#13;
28.   Technical assistance: Technical assistance will be provided to the FRD to prepare and&#13;
implement the project and to both FRD and RS RD for preparation of a follow on project - see&#13;
Section D Studies and Technical Assistance and Annex IV for details (pages 39 to 58).&#13;
29.     Mine Clearing: Several bridge sites are known to be mined as well as the verges of&#13;
the paved roads, rendering repairs and reconstruction work extremely hazardous. All work sites&#13;
need to be cleared of mines out to a distance allowing freedom of movement and operation of&#13;
construction and repair teams, and the edges of these cleared areas will have to be clearly&#13;
marked. This mine clearance will be carried out by contract, with supervision by a National Mine&#13;
Action Agency.&#13;
30.     Vehicles, engineering and design equipment: Equipment for the FRD and local&#13;
consultants for preparatory work and construction supervision. The equipment would include&#13;
such items as four wheel drive vehicles, theodolites and computers.&#13;
31.   The High Representative's Office has indicated that financing of humanitarian aid and&#13;
project preparation work but not of investment projects in the RS would be acceptable.&#13;
Investments proposed under this project which would benefit and be located in the RS are&#13;
therefore subject to prior discussions with the High Representative's Office at the appropriate&#13;
time. Accordingly, the project includes technical assistance for project preparation and buses and&#13;
bus spare parts to support freedom of movement. An Indicative Transport Reconstruction&#13;
Program for Republica Srpska is given in Annex I (pages 28-34) and will be considered for a&#13;
future project subject to prior discussions with the High Representative's Office'.&#13;
Costs&#13;
32.   The estimated cost of the proposed project, excluding local taxes and customs duties, is&#13;
shown in Table 2 below. The total project cost is US$149.0 million. The total estimated project&#13;
cost includes US$9.9 million to meet any physical contingencies on civil works (15% of the civil&#13;
works cost), and US$3.6 million (2.5% of the base cost) for price contingencies for a period of&#13;
one year.&#13;
1 In a letter dated March 9, 1996, the High Representative indicated that he considers it&#13;
now appropriate to finance programs that link the Federation areas and the Republica&#13;
Srpska areas.&#13;

Financing&#13;
33.     The size and composition of the project may be adjusted to take advantage of further&#13;
financing, bearing in mind important linkages and priorities.&#13;
34.     Financing Plan: Of the US$149.0 million, the Bank would provide US$35 million&#13;
from the TFBH, at concessional terms similar to those offered by IDA. The EU would provide&#13;
US$23.0 million as a grant for transport project component. The EBRD would provide a loan&#13;
and grants of about US$29.1 million, as well as grant funding for technical assistance for&#13;
Sarajevo airport. The Government of the Netherlands has given grants totaling US$50.0 million&#13;
for the benefit of BH, US$1.0 million of which has been allocated to transport for project&#13;
preparation activities. The Government of Italy has also indicated its interest to grant US$3&#13;
million for Sarajevo airport. The Czech Republic has shown its interest in assisting urban&#13;
transport with US$1.5 million. The balance of US$56.4 million is expected,to be provided by&#13;
donors both on a parallel basis as a financial contribution or in kind, and as Bank-administered&#13;
funds. Retroactive financing, up to US$7.0 million, will be required for some high priority items&#13;
(see para.57).&#13;

E. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
38.     The project will be implemented through PlIDs as noted above. The principal PID will&#13;
be located in the BHMTC. The PIDs will have the responsibility for overseeing the management&#13;
of the project through the actual implementing agencies such as the FRD, BH Railways etc. The&#13;
BHMTC will be advised by the PMA who already has been employed to assist in overall&#13;
coordination of the Program and of this project in particular. The PMA would have a deputy&#13;
PMA and would be responsible for assisting the BHMTC PID and the PIDs in the other two&#13;
ministries. From time to time, the PMA would be assisted by experts in procurement and other&#13;
specialized activities.&#13;
39.     Roads and bridges: For Part A and F and some assignments in Part E, the FRD&#13;
would be responsible for implementation of the components. Local and international consultants&#13;
would be employed to undertake designs and construction supervision. To strengthen its&#13;
capacity to implement the project in a timely and efficient manner, using the Dutch Trust Funds&#13;
(para 34), the FRD will employ additional critical FRD staff for planning, road maintenance, and&#13;
project preparation and implementation functions. In addition, under a Start Up Services&#13;
contract also financed from Dutch Trust Funds, road engineers and, on an intermittent basis, a&#13;
bridge engineer will be employed for about five months to assist the FRD with the start up of the&#13;
project. By then, an international consulting firm will be employed to provide Roads Advisory&#13;
Services (RAS) to assist the FRD in project implementation and both the FRD and the RSRD in&#13;
upgrading and modernizing directorate organizations including road maintenance management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex p.15. of 26&#13;
The RAS would also provide advice to the RDs and local consultants and, with them, will carry&#13;
out training in construction supervision. Please see para 58 for details of institutional&#13;
arrangements relating to procurement.&#13;
Procurement, Accounts, Reporting&#13;
40.   Procurement: Because of the urgent nature of the project, the works, goods and&#13;
services are required to be contracted and supplied quickly so that reconstruction works can&#13;
start and also be seen to be starting. Procurement for TFBH financed items and those&#13;
financed from Bank administered funds will follow the Bank's Guidelines within which&#13;
procurement under emergency projects will be followed; however, with the exception of the&#13;
Dutch Trust Funds, all other financing institution and donor participation is on a parallel&#13;
basis and these entities (including the other major participant - EBRD) will follow their&#13;
normal procurement procedures. The procedures for this project are set out below.&#13;
General&#13;
41.   Advertisement. As early as possible a General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be&#13;
published in the Development Business announcing ICB procurement packages and&#13;
consultants to be procured and inviting interested eligible suppliers, contractors and&#13;
consultants to send their expression of interest to the project implementation agencies in&#13;
BH. The GPN will also invite civil works contractors to request prequalification documents.&#13;
The GPN will also be published in Bosnian and English in the local press. The GPN will be&#13;
followed by specific advertisements for individual contracts in the local press. Bidding&#13;
documents will be sent to suppliers who will respond to the GPN.&#13;
42.   Bank's Standard Bidding Documents will be used. These documents are being&#13;
customized and approved for each component to avoid further reviews. The period allowed&#13;
for submission of bids may be reduced to four weeks. Bid and payment currency will be&#13;
limited to one currency widely used in international trade. The documents have been&#13;
translated into Bosnian.&#13;
Goods&#13;
43.   International Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be followed for procurement&#13;
packages estimated to cost more than US$5 million each. Given the small size of the goods&#13;
contracts, it is unlikely that ICB will be employed for goods.&#13;
44.   Limited International Bidding (LIB). LIB, tendering by invitation, will be used&#13;
for procurement packages estimated to cost over US$2 million but less than US$5 million&#13;
each. If there are a limited number of suppliers, the list for LIB should include them all.&#13;
Exceptions to this threshold will be the cases where there will be only a limited number of&#13;
suppliers. The following LIB procedure will be used:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex p.16 of 26&#13;
(a)    List of LIB bidders. The list will be based both on the expressions of interest&#13;
received in response to the GPN as well as other sources, such as the implementing&#13;
agency and procurement agent's own experience, etc. The list will be as broad as&#13;
possible but must include at least three suppliers. Geographical distribution will be&#13;
considered to the maximum extent possible;&#13;
(b)   Bidding Documents for LIB. The Bank's Standard Bidding documents will be&#13;
used (see ICB above). Procedures will be established to enable dispatch of bidding&#13;
documents and receipt of bids by the fastest means of communications, such as fax&#13;
machines. This shall be subject to condition that project implementation agencies&#13;
and procurement agents will be required to put in place a mechanism to ensure&#13;
transparency and fairness and to avoid any manipulation of bids received by faxes.&#13;
LIB contracts will require prior approval of the Bank relating to the list of suppliers&#13;
and technical specifications.&#13;
45.   International Shopping (IS). IS will be used for procuring nearly all the project&#13;
equipment and materials estimated to cost up to US$2.0 million per contract up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$1.5 million. IS is based on comparison of price quotations&#13;
obtained from at least three suppliers in two countries.&#13;
46.   National Shopping (LS). This method will be used for contracts for sundry items&#13;
and smaller items, including spare parts, computer equipment, and local commercial services&#13;
available in BH from more than one source up to an estimated cost of US$200,000 per&#13;
contract with at least three quotations.&#13;
47.   Direct Contracting (DC). Direct contracting will be used for proprietary items, for&#13;
reasons of compatibility and standardization, in any other justified case. All direct&#13;
contracting packages should be identified in the procurement plan for each project and&#13;
preapproved by the Bank. Any direct contracting during project implementation will need&#13;
prior Bank approval. Existing contracts will not be extended.&#13;
Works&#13;
48.   Prequalification: A prequalification of contractors, both for ICB and NCB, will be&#13;
carried out. For ICB, the Bank's standard prequalification documents will be followed; for&#13;
NCB, special documentation will be prepared with criteria to be agreed with the Bank. In&#13;
the interests of expediency, the notice inviting contractors to apply for prequalification will&#13;
be published as part of the GPN. which will be published as noted above (para 41). The&#13;
information in the completed questionnaire submitted by firms will be used to carry out their&#13;
general prequalification for different levels in terms of contract values. The prequalified&#13;
contractors will be listed in a registry. The registry will remain open for additions/deletions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex p.17. of 26&#13;
during the course of project implementation. The prequalification criteria shall be approved&#13;
by the Bank.&#13;
49.   International Competitive Bidding (ICB): See ICB for Goods above. ICB for&#13;
works will be used for contracts estimated to cost more than US$5.0 million each. The&#13;
advertisement procedure will be the same as for goods. The Bank's Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents for Works will be used for all ICB packages. ICB will be employed for the&#13;
construction of the Orasje bridge.&#13;
50.   National Competitive Bidding (NCB): Given the dispersed nature of works&#13;
(repairs of roads, etc.), NCB is proposed for contracts over US$1.0 million but less than&#13;
US$5.0 million per contract. However, interested foreign contractors will be allowed to&#13;
participate in NCB. The following procedure will be followed. Bidding Documents will be&#13;
sent to prequalified contractors who will be allowed four weeks to submit their bids. This&#13;
document shall include requirements based on the current situation in the country. The&#13;
German Mark (DM) will be used as the currency of bid pricing and contract. Most civil&#13;
works will be contracted using NCB.&#13;
51.   Simplified NCB. Simplified NCB will be used for works contracts estimated to cost&#13;
up to US$1 million per contract. These works will be procured under lumpsum, fixed price&#13;
contracts awarded on the basis of quotations from three qualified domestic contractors in&#13;
response to a written invitation. The invitation shall include a detailed description of works,&#13;
including basic specifications, the required completion period, a basic form of agreement&#13;
acceptable to the Bank and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award shall be made&#13;
to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the required work, and who has&#13;
the experience and resources to successfully complete the contract.&#13;
52.   Direct Contracting for Works. Any direct contracting not identified in the&#13;
procurement plan will be subject to the Bank's prior approval. Such approval has been&#13;
obtained for the direct contracting of the urgently needed reconstruction of the Bijela and&#13;
Jasen bridges on the M 17. The contract amounts will be about US$1,600,000 and&#13;
US$900,000 respectively (without contingencies).&#13;
Technical Services&#13;
53.   Limited International Bidding (LIB): LIB will be used to procure mine clearing&#13;
services (US$1.8 million) from a limited number of suppliers.&#13;
Services&#13;
54.   Consultants will be procured in accordance with the Bank Guidelines which shall&#13;
include both competition and sole sourcing. The sole sourcing packages will be identified&#13;
and justified in the procurement plan. Sole source contracting during project&#13;
implementation will need Bank's prior approval. Procurement documentation for contracts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex p.18 of 26&#13;
with consulting firms procured competitively and exceeding US$200,000 each will also be&#13;
subject to Bank's prior review. For individuals, the prior review threshold will be&#13;
US$50,000. Follow up assignments will be permissible to the extent that this will be&#13;
indicated in the initial TORs. Details of consulting assignments and selection methods are&#13;
given in Annex IV (page 39).&#13;
Second-hand Equipment&#13;
55.   Second-hand equipment, such as buses, can be procured through sole-sourcing with&#13;
the Bank's prior approval, provided the equipment is appraised by an independent technical&#13;
expert to confirm that the used equipment being considered will meet the criteria for quality,&#13;
technical requirements, and economic value, and that spare parts and service for the&#13;
equipment will be available for the operation of the equipment.&#13;
Procurement Agents&#13;
56.   Because of lack of institutional capacity in BH, procurement agents and&#13;
construction managers may be used who will be responsible for the whole process of&#13;
procurement. Sole sourcing may be accepted if justified. The agent's contracts would cover&#13;
"door-to-door" services, including bidding, contracting, verification/inspection, certification,&#13;
and preparation of withdrawal applications. These requirements will be reflected in the&#13;
terms of reference for procurement agents. The procurement agents will report to their&#13;
principals, i.e., implementation agencies, and will cooperate fully with these implementation&#13;
agencies.&#13;
57.   Retroactive financing of up to US$7.0 million will be permitted to finance mine&#13;
clearing, the Sava/Una bridges review, some road and bridge project design, advance and&#13;
progress payments for the Bijela and Jasen bridge contracts on the MI 7, down payments for&#13;
equipment, and advance payments to road and bridge contractors. These urgent activities&#13;
are expected to commence in March 1996 and well before the Credit Agreement is likely to&#13;
be signed. Items to be financed under retroactive financing need to be procured following&#13;
the Bank's Guidelines and particularly the procurement procedures detailed in this Annex.&#13;
58.   Procurement Institutional Arrangements: The FMTC  will delegate  its&#13;
responsibility for contracting national road and bridge civil works to the FRD. The FRD&#13;
with some of the same senior staff and the local consultants have experience in&#13;
implementing past Bank-financed civil works and are somewhat familiar with Bank&#13;
procedures. However, FRD staff have been considerably depleted and this, together with&#13;
the large size of the program and the need for speedy implementation, necessitates up-to-&#13;
date project management assistance which will be provided initially through the Start Up&#13;
Services (SUS) (para 36 (i)) and then through the RAS (para 36 (viii)). For procurement of&#13;
the Bank-financed equipment, the FMTC may employ the procurement agent under the&#13;
Emergency Recovery Project in which is included US$1 1.1 million of transport related&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex p.19. of 26&#13;
construction equipment. For smaller items and items that are urgently needed (such as the&#13;
engineering equipment), the FRD may undertake its own procurement with the assistance of&#13;
the SUS. Procurement responsibility for the international Orasje bridge will be determined&#13;
through agreements to be reached between the Republic of Croatia and BH. Technical&#13;
assistance services including the Gorazde road preparation services will be procured by the&#13;
agencies requiring their services - particularly by the FRD. Assistance in the selection&#13;
process will be provided by the PMA and the SUS. The Bank will join a Project Launch&#13;
Workshop to be held March/April 1996. A summary of the procurement arrangements is&#13;
given in Table 4 below.&#13;

61.     Special Account: To facilitate timely project implementation, the MoF would&#13;
establish, maintain and operate, under conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special&#13;
Account, in U.S. dollars in a commercial bank or in the Central Bank. The authorized&#13;
allocations of the MoF Special Account would be limited to US$5,000,000 representing&#13;
about four months (average) of the Bank's share of estimated expenditures expected to be&#13;
paid from the Special Accounts. Replenishment applications should be submitted at least&#13;
every three months, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other&#13;
appropriate documents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex p.22 of 26&#13;
62.      Statements of Expenditure (SOEs): Disbursements would be made against&#13;
Statements of Expenditures for contracts (a) for goods and works up to US$2,000,000&#13;
equivalent; (b) all incremental operating costs and commercial services; (c) for consulting&#13;
firms up to US$200,000 equivalent; and (d) for individual consultants up to US$50,000&#13;
equivalent, for which detailed documents evidencing expenditures will be reviewed by the&#13;
FRD and the BHMTC and FMTC and made available for the required audit as well as to&#13;
Bank supervision missions. Disbursements against contracts exceeding US$2,000,000&#13;
equivalent would be made against normal documentation. The project completion date&#13;
would be December 31, 1997. An indicative disbursement Schedule is given in Table 5.&#13;
63.     Accounts: Separate and auditable project accounts would be established in the&#13;
FRD and BHMTC. The project accounts would comprise (i) a record of withdrawals on the&#13;
Bank Credit (Trust Fund) with copies of all disbursement requests and underlying&#13;
documentation; (ii) a record of transactions on the Special Accounts and the copies of the&#13;
bank statements on this account. Project Accounts documentation would be maintained for&#13;
one year after they have been audited.&#13;
64.     Audits: The project accounts would be audited at the end of each fiscal year of&#13;
the Borrower by independent auditors and under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Separate audit statements would be prepared for the Special Account and for Statements of&#13;
Expenditures. All audit reports would be made available to the Bank at the latest six months&#13;
after the end of the fiscal year.&#13;
65.     Reporting: The BHMTC, the FMTC and FRD will prepare and furnish to the&#13;
Bank a quarterly progress report showing the status of implementation of the project as well&#13;
as financial report in a format and content acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
66.     Supervision Plan: Project implementation would incorporate maximum flexibility&#13;
in view of the fact that it will need to be adapted to changing circumstances.&#13;
Implementation progress would be evaluated at mid-term, i.e., approximately 9 months after&#13;
effectiveness. The review would assess the need for any adjustments, based on&#13;
implementation experience to date. The implementation responsibilities, as outlined above,&#13;
would be confirmed at negotiations. Given the need of expedited implementation of the&#13;
project, the project would be supervised every three months after effectiveness.&#13;
F. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
67.     Road Program: Using local consultants, 1MG had undertaken visual inspection of&#13;
most of the road network using a consistent system for assessing damage and repair costs. The&#13;
program was screened using this data and 1987 traffic data adjusted for changes in traffic&#13;
patterns. This gave an initial road program. An economic appraisal was undertaken for each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex p.23. of 26&#13;
activity proposed in the roads program: reconstruction, rehabilitation and overlays. The costs per&#13;
kilometer and the original condition of the pavement for each activity is detailed in Table 6&#13;
below.&#13;

68.     Vehicle operating costs (VOC) for a typical car and truck were calculated using input&#13;
data provided by the Croatian Roads Administration, where well developed systems for such&#13;
analysis exist. A 50:50 split between cars and trucks was assumed. The HDM III VOC model&#13;
was used. The latest available traffic data in BH is from 1987 and traffic levels have fallen&#13;
considerably since this date. A broad approach was therefore adopted and savings in VOCs were&#13;
calculated for a number of AADTs (Annual Average Daily Traffic) 500, 1,000 and 2,000, which&#13;
through observation and discussions with the RD were felt to represent typical current levels on&#13;
the main and regional roads. Traffic was projected over a 10-year time period from 1996 to 2005&#13;
using GDP projections provided by the IMF and the Bank mission. The internal rate of return&#13;
(IRR) for each option is presented in Table 7 below.&#13;
Table 7: Internal Rate of Return for Roads&#13;
Activity          |                    AADT&#13;

Rehabilitation             18%                44%                 107%&#13;
Overlay                    14%                36%                 86%&#13;
The analysis indicates that the road program proposed will yield high rates of return.&#13;
69.     Bridge Program: Critical bottlenecks in the road transport system are caused by&#13;
bridges destroyed during the course of the hostilities. Temporary bridge structures are now in&#13;
place on most of the main routes where bridges have been completely destroyed, but they are&#13;
normally only single lane. Traffic is delayed as a consequence of this reduced capacity and, at&#13;
certain locations, waiting times are considerable. A single lane pontoon bridge is now in place on&#13;
the Sarajevo to Mostar road, near Potoci, where delays of up to 4 hours have been recorded.&#13;
Where temporary structures are not available, diversions are made, increasing both the time and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex p.24 of 26&#13;
cost of travel and in some instances, for example at Capljina, causing congestion in urban&#13;
centers. Damaged bridges are still used despite the constant risk of failure.&#13;
70.     Given the urgency of the work, a pragmatic approach was adopted to the bridge&#13;
program, based on discussions with the RDs, site visits by this mission and available traffic data.&#13;
About 21 bridges are included, requiring varying levels of reconstruction and repair, with a&#13;
further 10 in the RS Indicative Program. The project bridges selected for financing are on main&#13;
road links and their reconstruction/repair will obviate the use of dangerous and/or lengthy&#13;
deviations.&#13;
71.     Both road and bridge programs will be reviewed by the FRD and the SUS. Any&#13;
revisions will be subject to the approval of the Bank.&#13;
72.      Equipment: The FRD now has little operational equipment, the consequence of&#13;
hostilities damage, inadequate maintenance and theft. At present there is little routine&#13;
maintenance being undertaken in BH, the consequence in part of inadequate funding, but lack of&#13;
equipment is also a major problem. Provision of equipment to the Federation road maintenance&#13;
units will facilitate the resumption of routine maintenance activities. Failure to execute an&#13;
effective program of maintenance would adversely effect the benefits expected from the road&#13;
reconstruction program.&#13;
73.      Sarajevo Airport: There are five airports in BH: Banja Luka, Bihac, Tuzla, Mostar&#13;
and Sarajevo, the first two of which are former military airports. For the foreseeable future,&#13;
Sarajevo airport is the only airport likely to play an important role in commercial operations. As&#13;
a consequence of hostilities damage and neglect of maintenance, Sarajevo airport cannot be&#13;
used, at present, for civilian operations, including scheduled passenger services. Access to the&#13;
country is restricted to limited and cumbersome air services out of Zagreb or overland by road.&#13;
A rehabilitation project must be put in place in order for the airport to meet intemational aviation&#13;
standards and to enable international scheduled airlines to make use of it (see Annex II). There is&#13;
an immediate need for a basic rehabilitation program for two reasons: (a) it will greatly facilitate&#13;
access to and from the country for intemational travelers; and (b) it will present evidence to the&#13;
intemational community that civilian rule is restored and the situation in the country normalized.&#13;
74.      Technical Assistance: All institutions responsible for transport have been severely&#13;
affected by the hostilities. The technical assistance services are required to ensure the timely and&#13;
efficient execution of the project and to build up the capacity and capability of the institutions&#13;
such that they can effectively manage the transport sector. In particular, the RAS will assist the&#13;
FMTC and RSMTCs and the RDs in a review and restructuring of their organizations -&#13;
particularly in the area of road maintenance. The resulting modernized road maintenance&#13;
management will result in efficiencies of operations and lower vehicle operating costs. The&#13;
Sava/Una river bridges review will result in prioritizing of works and should also assist in the&#13;
creation of an efficient inter governmental coordinating body to manage the intemational&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex p.25. of 26&#13;
crossings. The transport planning assistance will assist in the creation of a planning unit in the&#13;
BHMTC and will assist in developing both short and medium  term  priorities including&#13;
rationalizing of public transport services.&#13;
75.      Urban Transport: Buses in Sarajevo were used as barricades against sniping activity&#13;
and most of the remainder were severely damaged by gunfire and blast. The project will alleviate&#13;
the resulting grave shortage of public transport in Sarajevo and in other cities by providing new&#13;
and reconditioned buses and will increase the quality of service. Major benefits will include&#13;
sharply reduced passenger waiting times and severe overcrowding, vehicle maintenance savings,&#13;
higher level of availability and fuel savings.&#13;
76.      The project will thus make a major impact on most sub sectors in the reconstruction of&#13;
the transport sector which in tum will support a restart of economic activity in the country.&#13;

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA&#13;
EMERGENCY TRANSPORT RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT&#13;
Republica Srpska Indicative Program&#13;
1.    As indicated in the text (para 31), the High Representative's Office has indicated&#13;
that financing of humanitarian aid and project preparation work but not of investment&#13;
projects on the territory of the Republica Srpska would be acceptable. Investments&#13;
proposed under this project which would directly benefit and be located on the territory of&#13;
the Republica Srpska are therefore still subject to prior dicussions with the High&#13;
Representative's Office at the appropriate time. An Indicative Transport Reconstruction&#13;
Program for Republica Srpska is given below and may form part of a future project&#13;
subject to prior discussions with the High Representative's Office'.&#13;
2.    The RS Indicative Reconstruction Program  is similar to the program to the&#13;
Federation. However, while the program focuses also on priority links, some links have&#13;
increased in importance resulting from the Dayton Agreement.&#13;
3.    Roads (Table A): The road reconstruction shown in the Indicative Program and&#13;
totaling 150 km includes a significant upgrading to roads which reconnect major links&#13;
close to the separation line. The program also includes reconstruction and overlay of roads&#13;
leading to the border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Indicative Road&#13;
Program is subject to detailed studies and confirmation/revision of priorities.&#13;
4.    Bridges (Table B): The Indicative Program comprises the reconstruction of&#13;
several high-priority bridges which are now impassable including some around the Foca&#13;
area. The Program is also subject to detailed studies and confirmation/revision of&#13;
priorities.&#13;
5.    Construction, Maintenance, Asphalt, and Quarries Equipment (Table C and&#13;
D): The Indicative Program is similar to the Federation's.&#13;
6.    Buses (Table E): The Indicative Program comprises supply of buses, spares and&#13;
workshop equipment for the cities of Banja Luka, Trebinje, Bijeljina and Doboj. These&#13;
buses are included in the project (see para 31).&#13;
1 In a letter dated March 9, 1996 the High Representative indicated that he considers it&#13;
now appropriate to finance programs that link the Federation areas and the Republica&#13;
Srpska areas.&#13;

SARAJEVO AIRPORT INITIAL REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
1.    Background&#13;
In July 1992, UNPROFOR took over responsibility for the managemiient and operations of&#13;
the Airport on a temporary basis in order to ensure the transport of humanitarian aid and&#13;
various materials for the UNPROFOR operations. With the implementation of the Dayton&#13;
Agreement, responsibility for the operations of the Airport was transferred to IFOR, the&#13;
French Army on behalf of IFOR will continue to operate the Airport until the end of 1996&#13;
It is, however, expected that the Airport will gradually be taken over by a state-owned&#13;
corporation as from 15 April.&#13;
It is envisaged that the Airport will be rehabilitated in two phases: one initial rehabilitation&#13;
phase and one full rehabilitation phase. The purpose of the initial phase is to implement all&#13;
those measures which are required as a minimum in order to enable safe and secure&#13;
operations of scheduled aviation services at the Airport in accordance with ICAO&#13;
standards and recommended practices. The purpose of the full rehabilitation phase is then&#13;
to undertake the remaining works and the provision of additional equipment required to&#13;
provide a service level which is normal at an airport of the size of Sarajevo in Europe.&#13;
The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has made a preliminary&#13;
allocation of USD 10 million for financing the initial rehabilitation phase and an additional&#13;
USD 5 million have preliminary been pledged by one donor as a contribution to the initial&#13;
rehabilitation phase.&#13;
The EBRD has also allocated the ECU 150,000 from the Bank's Technical Cooperation&#13;
funds in order to prepare the preliminary design and cost estimates for the initial&#13;
rehabilitation phase. The terms of reference for this study, which are attached, have been&#13;
reviewed and discussed together with Directorate of Civil Aviation, including the&#13;
management of the Airport of Bosnia-Herzegovina.&#13;
2.    Issues&#13;
Approval of Initial Study: In order for the EBRD to initiate the recruitment of consultants&#13;
to undertake the preparation the preliminary design for the initial rehabilitation phase,&#13;
there is a need for an expression of approval by the Ministry of Transport and&#13;
Communications. Recruitment of consultants can commence on 23 February, so that the&#13;
consultants can commence working in the field at the beginning of March, leading to a&#13;
preliminary design with cost estimates being available by the end of April.&#13;
Proposed Rehabilitation Program for the Airside Infrastructure: Preliminary work has been&#13;
done to map out the rehabilitation works required of the airside infrastructure. In a study&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
Annex II p.2 of 3&#13;
carried out by the UN Office of the Special Coordinator for Sarajevo, dated April 1995, it&#13;
is proposed that 5 cm of wearing course plus I cm of the base course of the runway,&#13;
exitways, taxiway and the apron be cut out and be replaced with new asphalt concrete of&#13;
the same thickness. It is also proposed that an additional 8 cm of asphalt concrete be&#13;
added on the runway only, as reinforcement. The European Commission (EC) and the&#13;
French government have made available ECU 1.56 million and ECU 0.317 million,&#13;
respectively, to allow for a partial implementation of the rehabilitation works of the&#13;
runway during the first half of 1996; the French contribution would be in kind.&#13;
Work done by the EBRD mission suggests that there may be other and more appropriate&#13;
approaches to the reconstruction of the airside infrastructure both in the short and long&#13;
terms. It is likely that the most appropriate approach at the present time would be to&#13;
undertake a minimum program concerning the airside infrastructure during the present&#13;
year, comprising an overlay of micro asphalt. Such an action would likely enable more&#13;
extensive reconstruction works to be delayed for about three or four years and to be&#13;
undertaken as part of the proposed full rehabilitation phase of the airport.&#13;
The EBRD mission would therefore suggest that the resources made available by the EC&#13;
and the French government instead be devoted to implementing such a resurfacing&#13;
program, and that the remaining resources available from EC and France then be devoted&#13;
to a program of clearing the airport of all mines. Ideally, the mine clearing should be&#13;
undertaken in two phases; the first by the military and the second by an expert commercial&#13;
company in the field. A certificate of mine clearance is likely to be a requirement for any&#13;
other work on the rehabilitation of the airport to commence, and the mission would&#13;
therefore like to suggest that this be done as soon as possible.&#13;
The Institutional Structure for the Operations of the Airport: Annex 9 of the Dayton&#13;
Framework Agreement apparently does not provide for clear guidelines for the ownership&#13;
of and how to operate airports in the future Bosnia-Herzegovina. There is a need for the&#13;
parties concerned to reach an agreement on this in order for any actual implementation&#13;
work of the Sarajevo Airport to commence.&#13;
Institution Building: Although a substantial number of people who were involved in the&#13;
aviation sector in Sarajevo during the period of former Yugoslavia will be available for the&#13;
future operations of the airport, there is a need for designing a program for building up the&#13;
capacity required to operate the airport as an international airport, including to handle air&#13;
traffic control. The approach chosen to this end will be of crucial importance to the aim of&#13;
opening up the airport to international scheduled aviation. Initial discussions have been&#13;
held between the Directorate of Civil Aviation and the management of the airports of&#13;
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the EBRD mission. There is a need for developing these ideas&#13;
further, and also to mobilize the funds required for implementing the institution building&#13;
program on a timely basis.&#13;

Annex IV p.3 of 20&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project&#13;
Start Up Services&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
1.    Objective: The purpose of the assignment is provide assistance to the Federation&#13;
Roads Directorates of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the start-up phase of the roads, bridges&#13;
and tunnels (the roads) component of a proposed donor financed Emergency&#13;
Reconstruction Transport Project. The Services are expected to commence in mid-&#13;
February 1996.&#13;
2.    Background: Conscious of the need to rebuild the transport infrastructure of&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina following the recent war, the World Bank and the European&#13;
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) intend to finance (and act as&#13;
coordinators of other donors wishing to finance) an Emergency Reconstruction Transport&#13;
Project. A joint World Bank/EBRD appraisal of the proposed project was carried out in&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina during the period 10th to 23rd January 1996. Details of the&#13;
project are given in a discussion paper prepared during the course of the appraisal and&#13;
subsequent documents.&#13;
3.    The proposed project includes technical assistance to the Roads Directorates of&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina through a proposed Roads Advisory Service, but it is unlikely&#13;
that personnel to provide these services will be in place until about June 1996. There is,&#13;
therefore, a need for start-up advice and assistance to be provided to the Roads&#13;
Directorates commencing mid-February and lasting until the Roads Advisory Service is in&#13;
place.&#13;
4.    Scope of Work: The Consultants will work closely with the Ministry of Traffic&#13;
and Communications of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, IMG (based in&#13;
Sarajevo), the EBRD, and the World Bank's Resident Representative in Sarajevo in their&#13;
performance of the Services. The Consultants will be expected to travel throughout the&#13;
country as conditions permit but the Consultants should be aware that areas of the country&#13;
and facilities have been mined and they should not venture into such areas or facilities&#13;
before they have been certified clear of mines. At the moment, these Terms of Reference&#13;
do not cover the territory of Republica Srpska. Conditions may change, and the&#13;
Consultants should be prepared to expand their activities to cover Republica Srpska when&#13;
requested in writing by the Bank.&#13;
5.    Design and Construction: At the time of the appraisal mission a program of&#13;
emergency road and bridge repairs was drawn up and tentatively agreed with then&#13;
Ministry of Transport and the Roads Directorates in Mostar and Sarajevo (for the&#13;
Federation area). However, significant ministerial reorganizations have since taken place&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
Annex IV p.4 of 20&#13;
and there will be a need to review and agree the program with the new authorities,&#13;
keeping in mind that while priorities may change from those previously perceived, they&#13;
must still be based on sound economic criteria and value for money rather than political&#13;
considerations. With this in mind, the Consultants will, prior to (and as a basis for)&#13;
finalizing the road repair program, carry out a riding quality survey and drive-over visual&#13;
assessment of the roads under consideration.&#13;
6.    Draft terms of reference for the preparation of engineering designs and bidding&#13;
documents for road and bridge repair works have been drawn up and passed to local&#13;
consultants for comment and pricing. These negotiations must be finalized on realistic&#13;
terms of engagement in order that contracts for design may be prepared for Bank's&#13;
approval and letting. The Consultants will assist the Roads Directorates in determining&#13;
local consultants' equipment needs for the preparation of these designs.&#13;
7.    The Consultants will assist the Roads Directorates to manage the designs being&#13;
carried out and to ensure that appropriate and consistent standards are adopted in all&#13;
areas. The Bank's standard bidding documents have already been translated into Bosnian&#13;
but the Consultants will review the existing standard specification for road and&#13;
bridgework's and prepare an updating document in Bosnian and English for inclusion as&#13;
part of the standard bidding document. Work packages will be put together to enable a&#13;
variety of procurement methods to be used.&#13;
8.    The design of certain bridge works is already finalized but bidding documents must&#13;
be prepared in Bank's standard format to allow these works to be let to local contractors&#13;
by direct negotiation. The Consultants will also assist in negotiating contracts (including a&#13;
review of rates) with contractors for the construction of the Bijela and Jasen bridges and,&#13;
during the period of the Services, will assist in construction supervision.&#13;
9.    Road Maintenance: An estimate has been made of the number of road&#13;
maintenance depots to be established in each part of the country. This must be refined and&#13;
the extent and the condition of existing equipment verified. Eventually most periodic and&#13;
winter maintenance activities (and, possibly, even routine maintenance) will be contracted&#13;
out but recommendations are to be prepared on the road maintenance organization that&#13;
should be put in place both for the immediate need and in the longer term to ensure timely&#13;
maintenance of the repaired infrastructure.&#13;
10.   The number of aggregate crushing plants and asphalt plants to be established or&#13;
reestablished in each part of the country has to be agreed with the Roads Directorates. It&#13;
is envisaged that these plants will be run by local contractors on a commercial basis but&#13;
the way in which it will operate is still to be resolved. The Consultants must visit each site&#13;
and determine the condition of the existing equipment to see whether completely new&#13;
equipment or just spare parts are needed and to confirm, in the case of the aggregate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-&#13;
Annex IV p.5 of 20&#13;
crushing plants, that the type of material available is indeed suitable. Each plant is to be&#13;
sited so that maximum benefit can be obtained from the equipment provided.&#13;
11.   The Consultants will prepare  specifications and  bidding  documents for&#13;
maintenance and quarry equipment and will assist in its procurement. For the more&#13;
immediate items, the Consultants may be called upon to assist the Federation Ministry of&#13;
Traffic and Communications and the Roads Directorates through the entire process; for&#13;
other items and for donor supplied equipment (either parallel financing or in kind) the&#13;
Services are likely to be advisory only.&#13;
12.   Time Schedule: The Consultants are expected to arrive in Sarajevo to commence&#13;
work on or about 15 February 1996.&#13;
13.   Reporting: The Consultants will produce the following reports in accordance&#13;
with the schedule below in the requested languages:&#13;

Annex IV p.6 of 20&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina Reconstruction Program&#13;
Road Advisory Services&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
1.    Objective:   The objective of services is to provide advice and assistance to the Federation&#13;
Road Directorate (FRD) of Bosnia and Herzegovina in managing their road and bridge reconstruction&#13;
programs.&#13;
2.    Background' Together with loss of life and severe damage to property and infrastructure,&#13;
hostilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina have damaged roads and bridges and have also brought about a&#13;
3-4 year hiatus in road maintenance. Bridges have been destroyed, tunnels damaged and road&#13;
pavements have deteriorated both due to direct damage from the hostilities (track damage, shell holes,&#13;
overloading and destruction of secondary roads etc) and also, most markedly, due to neglect. In&#13;
addition, road maintenance equipment has been purloined, damaged or destroyed, and road&#13;
maintenance units broken up.&#13;
3.    In 1993, through UN auspices and with funding from the European Union, a project&#13;
management group was formed called the International Management Group (1MG). 1MG filled a vital&#13;
need and has performed a multitude of tasks ranging from procurement of equipment for&#13;
UNPROFOR, managing construction and reconstruction projects (by UNPROFOR) to working with&#13;
many Government entities in damage assessment and containment. IMG has branches in Zenica, Tuzla,&#13;
Mostar, Sarajevo and in Zagreb (Republic of Croatia). IMG has detailed and well prepared data on the&#13;
road system and its status and will cooperate fully with the consultants in providing this data and in&#13;
assisting the Consultants in carrying out these Terms of Reference&#13;
4.    A World Bank led reconstruction mission took place October/November and prepared and&#13;
distributed a report entitled 'Bosnia and Herzegovina: Priorities for Recovery and Growth" The report&#13;
covers in some details the reconstruction needs all sectors including the roads and bridges sub sector.&#13;
The report was discussed at Donor's meeting held December 20 and 21, 1995. In these ToR, the&#13;
report is referred to as the Program. In January 1996, a combined Bank/EBRD follow up mission took&#13;
place to prepare an Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project. The Project is the first step to&#13;
implementing the overall Program.&#13;
5.    In the overall Program, the road, bridge, tunnel and road maintenance and associated&#13;
equipment program amounts to US$468 million with a target first year commitment of US$174&#13;
million. Road maintenance equipment, asphalt and quarry equipment makes up about half (US$84&#13;
million) of the first year amount and, indeed, much of it must be procured before many road works can&#13;
begin. There is a critical need to assist with the organization of this massive road program, to arrange&#13;
For a complete background, please see the report " Bosnia and Herzegovina: Priorities&#13;

documents, invite bids and award contracts and, in road maintenance, confirm the condition of existing&#13;
equipment and the proposed requirements for the future road maintenance management system, and to&#13;
prepare the equipment specifications.&#13;
6.    The proposed Transport Reconstruction Project appraised In January, 1996, amounts to about&#13;
US$149 miilion and comprises&#13;
(i)    Roads: the overlay and rehabilitation of about 180km high priority road sections&#13;
to restore these links to serviceable condition;&#13;
(ii)   Bridges: reconstruction of about 21 high priority bridges to eliminate lengthy&#13;
and/or dangerous deviations;&#13;
(iii)  International Bridges: reconstruction of the Brcko rail and Orasje road bridges&#13;

Annex IV p.8 of 20&#13;
(xvi) Diesel Fuel: a fuel component has also been included for parallel financing but has&#13;
not been included in the overall cost.&#13;
7.    The Federation Road Directorate (FRD) has been affected by the hostilities with that for the&#13;
Federation having lost its premises, its equipment and with a good portion of its staff dispersed.&#13;
Assistance is needed not only to implement the Project described above, but also to assist in rebuilding&#13;
and modernizing the FRD such that they can implement the overall reconstruction Program and&#13;
manage the networks in an efficient manner.&#13;
8.    To meet immediate needs, a consulting firm has already been employed directly by the World&#13;
Bank to provide Start Up Services which will assist the Federation RD with the first stages of project&#13;
management and with the preparation of equipment specifications. The services covered by these ToR&#13;
will take over and expand the work begun by this firm.&#13;
9.     Scope of Consulting Services. The scope of the services are set out below; however, the&#13;
Consultants should recognize that the situation is an unusual one and that, within the overall objectives&#13;
of the services, calls may be made on their services which depart from those listed below. In the&#13;
conduct of their work, the Consultants shall be working alongside staff of the Federation RD and shall&#13;
collaborate fully with such staff. As necessary, the consultants will also collaborate with other branches&#13;
of the government and with the government of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The consultants&#13;
will also collaborate fully with IMG which has agreed to assist the consultants in the attainment of the&#13;
objectives. Further, many donors are expected to participate in the transport reconstruction program&#13;
with their activities following different procedures and practices, including different procurement&#13;
procedures and with these activities at different stages. The consultants will need to demonstrate a high&#13;
degree of adaptability to the preparation and implementation of the program as it evolves. An&#13;
indicative staffing schedule is attached.&#13;

(ix)   engineering equipment; and&#13;
(x)    coordination.&#13;
12.   Confirmation of Needs and Priorities: With the FRD and local consultants, 1MG has carried&#13;
out damage assessments of most roads, bridges and tunnels. After discussions with IMG, the&#13;
Consultants will confirm/refine the assessments to the extent necessary for the appropriate levels of&#13;
investigation and design. The Consultants will continue with an assessment of maintenance, quarry and&#13;
asphalting equipment if any assessment is still outstanding. The Consultants will also review the overall&#13;
road, bridge and tunnel reconstruction program and advise on any desirable changes in priorities.&#13;
13.   Project Management: Assisting with project management will be the consultants main&#13;
activity. The Consultants will continue past assistance to the RDs in planning, organizing and managing&#13;
tasks and resources needed for the preparation and implementation activities such that all the planned&#13;
first year work/ procurement commences within 1996 with commitments in line with the Program&#13;
amount of around US$ 297.0 million. The Consultants will introduce up to date computer assisted&#13;
planning techniques and will train local staff in their use. This will include a confirmation/revision of an&#13;
assessment of available capacity including capacity within the FRD itself, the local consulting industry,&#13;
local capacity and the capacity that is likely to be available in adjoining countries. The Consultants will&#13;
make recommendations and also assist with expanding this capacity to meet the needs of the Program -&#13;
including expanding the staff of the FRD. The Consultants will introduce up to date computer assisted&#13;
project management techniques and will train local staff in their use.&#13;
14.   Investigation: The Consultants will assist in determining the levels of investigation still&#13;
required of the various works. In considering investigation or any activity at a potential works site, the&#13;
Consultants will assist the FRD in its dealing with competent entities including NATO in ensuring that&#13;
sites and surrounding area are mine free. For roads, while some works are of such an urgent nature that&#13;
overlays are required immediately, for the remainder, the Consultants will assist the FRD in setting up&#13;
systematic pavement strength assessment programs. The Consultants contract includes for the&#13;
procurement of some of this equipment. For this and other equipment (procured, rented or borrowed),&#13;
the Consultants will train both FRD and local consulting staff in its use.&#13;
15    Design: Local consultants are quite capable of undertaking acceptable road and bridge design&#13;
and, apart form random design checks, it is not expected that the Consultants will need to engage any&#13;
detailed design themselves; however there is a need to modernize the design process and improve&#13;
productivity. Road geometric design standards have been agreed with the World Bank and the German&#13;
DIN standards used for bridge design are also acceptable. The Consultants should ensure that road and&#13;
bridge standards incorporate the new European 11.5 ton axle load and that, as appropriate, designs&#13;
take account of military traffic. The Consultants will also review the construction specifications to&#13;
determine if these are acceptable for the proposed works and will recommend any revisions deemed&#13;
necessary. The Consultants will assist the FRD in arranging for all documents to be translated into the&#13;
English language - for drawings, this need only be a glossary of terms used in the drawings -or, if the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-&#13;
Annex IV p.10 of 20&#13;
English language is not acceptable, in a language requested by a particular donor. In addition, the FRD&#13;
and the local consultants could benefit from assistance in the management of the design process to&#13;
achieve economy efficiency and timely production of documents suitable for bid invitation. FRD staff&#13;
and local consultants could also benefit from training in modem pavement assessment and design, and&#13;
the introduction of contemporary computerized road and structural design techniques.&#13;
16    Procurement Activities: The Consultants will assist the RD with procurement activities but,&#13;
except for the procurement of computers, office and engineering equipment, not with actual&#13;
procurement. In other words, except as previously noted, the Consultants will not act as procurement&#13;
agents. Some of this procurement will be already underway. The assistance will comprise assistance in&#13;
procurement planning, preparation of documentation, the bidding and evaluation process and contract&#13;
award and monitoring. The procurement arrangements will largely depend on the procedures of a&#13;
particular donor/financing agency. For World Bank and EBRD procurement, both the World Bank and&#13;
the EBRD Guidelines on Procurement and on Consultants (as modified for emergency procurement for&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina) will be used together with the Bank's Standard documentation. The&#13;
Consultants will liaise with other advisors providing procurement assistance to the Ministries of&#13;
Transport and to other agencies, and with the implementation staff in the World Bank Resident&#13;
Mission.&#13;
17.   Construction Supervision: Under the project management activity, the consultants will assist&#13;
the RDs in organizing effective construction supervision. In the past, under the self management&#13;
system, construction supervision was limited. The Consultants will therefore be expected to prepare&#13;
ToRs for such supervision and provide theoretical and on-the-job training to RD staff and local&#13;
consultants in supervision practice. The repaving projects are seen as suitable vehicles for 'hands on"&#13;
construction supervision training and, for the larger works, if they have not already done so,&#13;
consultants may be asked to hire some international staff to provide the core for their supervision&#13;
activities.&#13;
18.   Equipment Specifications: It is expected that most of the equipment specifications will have&#13;
been prepared prior to the start of these services; however, if some road maintenance, asphalting,&#13;
quarry or other RD related specifications still have to be prepared, assisting with their preparation will&#13;
be the responsibility of the Consultants. These should be prepared to meet the requirements of the&#13;
donors/financing agencies concerned.&#13;
19.   Road Maintenance: The Consultants will advise the FRD in al] aspects of maintenance policy&#13;
and practice. This will include a refining of the preliminary work undertaken by IMG and by the Start&#13;
Up Services consultants (para 8) and recommending policy, organizations and practices for road&#13;
maintenance on a prioritized permanent basis. On a preliminary basis, equipment is being procured to&#13;
equip eighteen maintenance depots for the entire country. The Consultants should not be bound by this&#13;
figure and should feel free to make their own recommendations for the organizations. The aim is to set&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-&#13;
Annex IV p.1 1 of 20&#13;
up road maintenance management organizations which will function on the basis of a modem road&#13;
maintenance management system. When conditions return to near normal, i.e when the urgent works&#13;
are completed, road maintenance policy should be such that most periodic maintenance activities, snow&#13;
clearing and other well defined activities will be undertaken through contracts with private contractors.&#13;
This should be taken into account when devising a program for the urgent overlay works so that as&#13;
much work as possible is put out to contract with private contractors. Nevertheless, given that most&#13;
overlay work was previously undertaken by the road organizations themselves, it is unlikely that, even&#13;
in normal times, there was much contracting capacity with the asphalting capability needed for this&#13;
urgent program. Hence it could be that, initially, most of the urgent overlays are undertaken by&#13;
maintenance units and equipment to be procured under the Program will be allocated to them. But, at&#13;
some time in the future, mechanisms should be set up such that this asphalting equipment can be sold&#13;
to local contractors. Similarly, at the start of the program, if there are local contractors who have a&#13;
track record of performing this type of work, some equipment might be made available to these&#13;
contractors either through outright sale, loans or deductions from the contracts.&#13;
20.   Engineering Equipment: The project includes for the procurement of 8 vehicles and&#13;
US$670,000 of investigation, design, computer and office equipment. Immediately on arrival, the&#13;
Consultants should assess with the FRD its specific requirements and, as appropriate, local consultants.&#13;
Major items may be held by the FRD and rented to local consultants for use on the Program.&#13;
21.   Coordination: It is self evident that with a Program of this size and with the willingness of&#13;
donors to assist in its implementation that there must be good coordination amongst all parties. The&#13;
Consultants will assist the FRD with this coordination ensuring a minimum of duplication of effort in&#13;
preparation and implementation. Through the FRD, the Consultants will maintain constant contact with&#13;
donor and financing agencies offices in Sarajevo and will assist the FRD in preparing status reports for&#13;
interested parties. The Consultants will also assist the FRD in managing the expected large flow of&#13;
solicitations expected from consulting firms, suppliers and contractors. Time Schedule: The period of&#13;
the assignment is 30 months. The Consultants will be expected to mobilize their team (at a minimum,&#13;
the team leader) in Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Starting Date (the date from which payments are&#13;
measured); the Starting Date will be two weeks after contract signing.&#13;
22.   Reporting Requirements: The Consultants shall prepare and submit the following reports to&#13;
the Government of the Federation and the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to other&#13;
parties as noted, within the time periods and in the quantities and language required (to be determined).&#13;
23.   All reports to the Government shall be in Bosnian. All reports to the World Bank shall be in&#13;
English. Reports to donors may be in English or the language of the donor. Inception and progress&#13;
reports shall be brief The inception report shall summarize the Consultant's initial findings, outstanding&#13;
mobilization problems (if any) and out line of the work program for the next six months. Progress&#13;
reports shall contain a brief summary of the work accomplished in the previous two months, an outline&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-&#13;
Annex IV p.12 of 20&#13;
of the work to be performed over the next two works and any issues being faced. The format and&#13;
content of other reports will be determnined during the assignment.&#13;
24.   Training: The Consultants will be expected to make every effort to transfer skills and modem&#13;
concepts to the local personnel with whom they are working. As part of this goal, the Consultant will&#13;
hold seminars and workshops on the subjects relevant to the services, covering particularly, project&#13;
management, construction supervision and road maintenance management systems. The Consultants&#13;
will also assist in selecting and placing personnel on study tours to be funded under the overall&#13;
Program.&#13;
25.    Data, Services and Facilities to be Provided by the Government: To be discussed with the&#13;
Governments. However, it is unlikely that much can be provided. It would be advantageous for the&#13;
Consultants offices to be in the roads directorates buildings and it is possible that the Government&#13;
might fund the communications costs.&#13;
26.   Services and Facilities to be Provided by the Consultant: The Consultants will be expected&#13;
to provide their own accommodation, transport, office equipment, supplies, translators, secretaries,&#13;
drivers, and the running cost of the vehicles and the offices.&#13;

Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project&#13;
Review of Sava / Una River International Crossings&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
I. Objectives&#13;
1.    The objectives of the services (the Review) are: (i) to prepare a report on the status,&#13;
existing designs, required preparation work, preliminary cost estimates and recommendations on a&#13;
reconstruction program concerning the reconstruction of the ten international road and rail&#13;
bridges on Sava and Una bridges on the border of the Republic of Croatia and the State of Bosnia&#13;
and Herzegovina; and (ii) to provide recommendations (including models) on the agreements&#13;
which should be reached between the governments for the construction and maintenance of the&#13;
bridges. The results of the review and material collected will be held by the governments of the&#13;
Republic of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and, within Bosnia and Herzegovina the Federation&#13;
of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republica Srpska.&#13;
H. Background&#13;
3.    Together with loss of life and severe damage to property and infrastructure, hostilities in&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina have damaged roads and bridges and have also brought about a 3-4 year&#13;
hiatus in road maintenance. Bridges have been destroyed, tunnels damaged and road pavements&#13;
have deteriorated both due to direct war damage (track damage, shell holes, overloading and&#13;
destruction of secondary roads etc) and also, most markedly, due to neglect. In addition, road&#13;
maintenance equipment has been purloined, damaged or destroyed, and road maintenance units&#13;
broken up. All international bridges spanning the Sava and Una rivers have been cut and at least&#13;
one is still mined.&#13;
3.    Some reviews of the Sava\Una have already taken place with variations in detail and depth&#13;
depending the accessibility of the bridges at the time the review took place. Probably the most&#13;
detailed information is held by IFOR whose engineers have detailed photographs of each site and&#13;
some further information. A report on the original construction of each road bridge is available -&#13;
but not necessarily the original drawings.&#13;
4.    A World Bank led reconstruction mission has prepared, and distributed to potential&#13;
donors, a report entitled "Bosnia and Herzegovina: Priorities for Recovery and Growth". The&#13;
report covers in some details the reconstruction needs all sectors including the roads and bridges&#13;
sub sector. The report was discussed at Donor's meeting held December 20 and 21, 1995. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52-&#13;
Annex IV p.14 of 20&#13;
these ToR, the report is referred to as the Program. In January 1996, a combined Bank/EBRD&#13;
follow up mission took place to prepare a Transport Reconstruction Project. The project includes&#13;
this review and the possible reconstruction of the Orasje road bridge. The governments of the&#13;
State of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, the Federation and Republica Sprska&#13;
have all expressed their support for the Review.&#13;
III. Scope of Services&#13;
5.    General: The consultants should  contact all appropriate  governmental or non-&#13;
governmental, civilian and military agencies including the relevant ministries, road directorates,&#13;
local authorities, IFOR, consultants, and contractors (including Duro Dakovic) on both sides of&#13;
the rivers and to obtain all the available information on the bridges. The World Bank will assist in&#13;
arranging the contacts. The consultants will document and copy the data and its sources and will&#13;
analyze the information received.&#13;
Status Assessment&#13;
6.    The consultants will then arrange to visit all the bridge sites with the appropriate&#13;
authorities (usually with different authorities on the each side of the river) to confirm, revise&#13;
and/or update the information available. Some of these site are know to be mined. The&#13;
Consultants will be expected to arrange with the appropriate authorities - principally IFOR -&#13;
before visiting the sites and should arrange for IFOR escorts where [FOR thinks necessary. The&#13;
World Bank will assist in all such contacts with IFOR. The consultants will make records of&#13;
significant meetings with parties and individuals concerned. The consultants will visit all the sites&#13;
and will take photographs in sufficient number and good quality to confirm the location, the&#13;
situation and the damages occurred. Based upon this information review, site visits and&#13;
interviews, the consultants will prepare a report which will include (inter alia) for each bridge:&#13;
(i)   information on the original design and construction;&#13;
(ii)   a history and assessment of the damage;&#13;
(iii)  information on the accessibility of both sides of each bridge site (i.e the extent of&#13;
mines);&#13;
(iv)   alternative crossing arrangements which might be in place or are being considered&#13;
(pontoon bridges, ferries etc)&#13;
(v)   an assessment of the state of any reconstruction design;&#13;
(vi)  information on any contracts awarded (debris removal, pier repairs etc)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-&#13;
Annex IV p.15 of 20&#13;
Technical Assessment&#13;
7.    The consultants will assess the work required to complete the reconstruction of each&#13;
bridge at each bridge site. This should include:&#13;
(i)   the extent of mine clearing required;&#13;
(ii)  recommendations on debris removal;&#13;
(iii)  the need for site investigations:&#13;
(iv)  the level of design work required;&#13;
(v)   taking into account the need for economy and efficiency and speed of&#13;
reconstruction, contracting alternatives with recommendations;&#13;
8.    The consultants should also make recommendations conceming the advisability of&#13;
reconstructing each bridge in its original configuration or in a form that would be more&#13;
economical and or technically advantageous.&#13;
Cost estimates&#13;
9     The consultants prepare preliminary cost estimates for the necessary design work and&#13;
bidding documents, for the removal of debris, and for the reconstruction.&#13;
International agreements&#13;
10.   All the bridges included in this review will cross from the Republic of Croatia to the&#13;
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina with, within Bosnia and Herzegovina, one crossing situated&#13;
in the Federation and the other nine in the Republica Srpska. Some intemational agreements need&#13;
to be reached on the reconstruction and management of the bridges.&#13;
11.   After discussions with the various authorities and based on experience elsewhere, the&#13;
consultants will make recommendations as the type of agreements which should be reached and&#13;
will provide draft model agreements. The consultants should consider staging the agreement&#13;
process such that, say, memorandums of understanding, can be agreed to allow investigation and&#13;
design work to commence. For the purpose of the review, cost sharing between Croatia and&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina should be considered on a 50/50 basis.&#13;

Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project&#13;
Program Management Adviser&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
1.    Objective: The objective of the Program Management Adviser's (PMA) assignment is to&#13;
provide advice and assistance to the Federation Ministry of Traffic and Communication (FMTC)&#13;
in the implementation of (a) the Transport Component of the World Bank prepared&#13;
Reconstruction Program; and (b) the World Bank/EBRD financed Transport Reconstruction&#13;
Project (the Project)'. For full details of the Project, please see the Project Technical Annex&#13;
attached.&#13;
2     Background: Prior to the war, the transport system of Bosnia and Herzegovina was&#13;
organized to meet the needs of the former Yugoslavia. Inland transport was provided by a road&#13;
system (including 8,600 km of main and regional roads) and a rail network (1,030 km, 75%&#13;
electrified) which was generally adequate in extent and condition. The primary port for what is&#13;
now a land-locked country is in Ploce, in southem Croatia (see map, p.70). Civil aviation airports&#13;
were located in Sarajevo and Mostar, and military airports in Tuzla, Bihac and Banja Luka.&#13;
3.    As with other sectors, the ability of the transport sector to function has been seriously&#13;
affected by the hostilities. Bridges have been damaged or destroyed, road pavements have been&#13;
damaged or have deteriorated due to neglect, regional and local roads used as bypasses have also&#13;
suffered with forestry roads and earth tracks pressed into service and kept open with massive&#13;
UJNPROFOR maintenance. Although the railway east and west of Banja Luka is open, the main&#13;
line between Sarajavo and Ploce (in Croatia) has been cut, is virtually not functioning, and most&#13;
rolling stock is sitting in isolated pockets and for the most part in unknown condition. Sarajevo&#13;
airport is badly damaged and is being operated by IFOR under military conditions. The port of&#13;
Ploce in Croatia functions but requires upgrading to handle Bosnia and Herzegovina traffic. Due&#13;
to severely damaged stock, only a handful of trams and buses are operating in Sarajevo and buses&#13;
in other cities.&#13;
4.    Reconstruction of the transport network is essential for the recovery of economic activity&#13;
and the unification of the country. However, investment priorities on several transport corridors&#13;
will be determined, by the rate at which the territories settle down after the peace settlement, and&#13;
to some extent, the timing of works by IFOR operations. Priorities will also be determined by&#13;
The project will be co-financed with several other donors under terms yet to be determined.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-56-&#13;
Annex IV p. 18 of 20&#13;
freedom of access to traditional transport corridors including enclaves with access under the&#13;
peace settlement.&#13;
5.    Recognizing these circumstances, a World Bank led team proposed a Reconstruction&#13;
Program (the Program)2 and, in transport, recommended that investments be concentrated first&#13;
on transport systems which are going to be needed under any scenario, and plan in a flexible way&#13;
to adapt to new situations. The Report identified the most important transport systems to include&#13;
the north-south corridor of Ploce-Sarajevo-Zenica-Tuzla and possibly further north, transport&#13;
links with Banja Luka, inter city main and regional roads, roads running east-west in the South,&#13;
and the road to Gorazde in the east, Sarajevo Airport, public transport and some street works,&#13;
particularly in Sarajevo and recommend that reconstruction priorities should be concentrated on&#13;
these systems. The report further recommended that first year projects should include those&#13;
required to overcome serious constraints, an upgrading of roads which have become important&#13;
due to territorial realignments changes, a restoration of infrastructure and services on the most&#13;
important parts of the network, and the re-establishment of maintenance activities.&#13;
7.    In January, 1996 a joint World Bank/EBRD mission assisted the governments in preparing&#13;
a Transport Reconstruction Project (the Project) comprising quick disbursing components. The&#13;
proposed project is consistent with the Program and includes investments for high priority first&#13;
year program works in the principal corridors with accompanying equipment and institution&#13;
building to support their sustainability. The project complements the expected activities of other&#13;
donors and financing agencies, notably EBRD and bilateral agencies who have indicated an&#13;
interest in (inter alia) reconstructing airport, railway and port facilities.&#13;
8.    Most institutions have suffered loss of staff and premises due to the hostilities and there is&#13;
little budgetary support for their activities. The Federal Roads directorate has been particularly&#13;
hard hit with no premises and a much reduced staff. There is therefore a need for technical&#13;
assistance to assist with the implementation of the Project including coordination of all aspects of&#13;
the Program.&#13;
Scope of Services.&#13;
General&#13;
9.    Within its organization, the FMTC has created a small Project Implementation Directorate&#13;
(PID) responsible for the preparation and implementation of components of the overall Transport&#13;
Reconstruction Program (the Program). The PMA will be located within the State Ministry of&#13;
External Trade and Communications with a Deputy PMA in the PID. There will be thus a&#13;
minimum of two persons providing project management advice and assistance (the PMA staff).&#13;

with assisting with a planned program of project implementation. The duties of the PID are given&#13;
below together with the detailed services to be provided by the PMA staff. While the services are&#13;
specifically directed at the forthcoming Project, the duties will also apply to the Program as a&#13;
whole.&#13;

procurement;&#13;
(ii)   disbursement activities;&#13;
(iii)   monitoring, accounting and auditing;&#13;

16.   The first task of the PMA staff will be to quickly assess the status of preparation and&#13;
implementation of the Project and identify and assist in removing constraints such that the Project&#13;

            equipment and assistance to prepare, implement and maintain
            the First Year Program (FYP) works as well as a framework
            for the future development and management of the
            country's transport system. The project consists of the
            following components: 1) reconstruction and rehabilitation
            of roads and bridges (including the international bridges
            across Sava/Una Rivers), repair of tunnels and slips, supply
            of construction and maintenance equipment and supply of
            asphalt and quarries equipment; 2) railway equipment; 3)
            Sarajevo Airport rehabilitation and design works; 4) urban
            transport including supply of buses, spares, workshop
            equipment, safety equipment and urgent repairs to city
            streets; 5) technical assistance comprising consulting
            services and engineering equipment; 6) preliminary study and
            design of Gorazde road; 7) mine clearing; and 8) bitumen.
