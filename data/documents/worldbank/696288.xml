REPUBLIC OF UZBEKISTAN&#13;
PILOT WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING PROJECT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Background: General&#13;
1.    At a meeting of the Heads of Governments of the five Aral Sea states in February 1994, it was&#13;
decided to include the Uzbekistan Rural Water Supply, Sanitation, and Health Project in the Aral Sea&#13;
Program presented to an international donor's conference held in Paris in June 1994. At this conference,&#13;
it was decided that the World Bank would take the lead in preparing a project focusing on the two regions&#13;
of Uzbekistan most severely affected by the Aral Sea disaster: the Republic of Karakalpakstan and&#13;
Khorezm Oblast.&#13;
2.    The Republic of Uzbekistan is the most populated of the five Central Asian Republics with a&#13;
population of 22.2 million, of which some 60%  live in rural communities.  Agriculture is the&#13;
predominant economic activity in this semi-arid country. Only 10% of the land is cultivated, of which&#13;
95% is irrigated by two major river systems: the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, both of which flow into&#13;
the Aral Sea. Since the 1960s, increasing use of these rivers for agriculture, particularly cotton growing,&#13;
has resulted in greatly reduced volumes of run off entering the Aral Sea and excessive contamination from&#13;
leached salts and agricultural chemicals. In 1960 it was the fourth largest inland lake in the world. Since&#13;
then it has shrunk to less than half its original size because of the nearly total cut off of river inflow from&#13;
the AmuDarya and Syr Darya rivers as a result of heavy withdrawals for irrigation. The desiccation of&#13;
the Sea has resulted in the loss of its fishing, tourist and shipping industry, the destruction of the&#13;
ecosystem of the Sea and deltas, the blowing of salts from the exposed seabed and severely depressed the&#13;
economy of the region. The most adversely affected regions in Uzbekistan are the Republic of&#13;
Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast.&#13;
Background: Aral Sea Disaster Region&#13;
3.    Population.  Uzbekistan comprises 12 provinces (oblasts) as well as the Republic of&#13;
Karakalpakstan, and includes 123 cities and 157 rural regions. Karakalpakstan encompasses 37% of the&#13;
land area of the Republic and has a population of 1.37 million, most of whom occupy the Amu Darya&#13;
delta. Approximately 50% live in very small rural communities associated with state and collective&#13;
farms. By contrast, Khorezm Oblast occupies only 1.4% of the land area of the Republic, but due to&#13;
intensive cultivation and irrigation, it supports an almost similar size population of 1.17 million, of which&#13;
more than 75 % live in very small rural communities. The ethnic structure of the populations in the two&#13;
regions also are quite different from each other with Karakalpakstan consisting of almost equal numbers&#13;
of Uzbeks, Karakalpaks, and Kazakhs, while 95% of the population in Khorezm are Uzbeks. The&#13;
average family size in Karakalpakstan is 7.6 compared to 7.1 in Khorezm (both are above the national&#13;
average of 6.9).&#13;
4.    Socio Economic Conditions.  Karakalpakstan is the poorest region of Uzbekistan with a&#13;
significant percentage of the population living below poverty level. The most striking result of the recent&#13;
needs assessment survey of 951 rural and urban households representing 100 communities in the region&#13;
indicates that 93% and 78% of the family budget is spent on food in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm,&#13;
respectively. Average monthly family income in November 1994 from all sources, including garden plots&#13;
and livestock was 567 sum (US$23) and 695 sum (US$28). Another key finding of the needs assessment&#13;
was that the majority of households (about 65%) mentioned lack of food, particularly flour, as their most&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
important problem, about 59% of the households mentioned that lack of money to buy food products was&#13;
their second most important problem and about 25 % said that their third most important problem was lack&#13;
of water. Notwithstanding the poor economic conditions, only 4% of the households surveyed expressed&#13;
a desire to leave the area.&#13;
5.     Water Supply System. Because of the low rainfall (about 110 mm/year), water supply in the&#13;
region depends almost entirely on the Amu Darya River and its system of irrigation canals; the one&#13;
exception being deep saline ground water from wells drilled down to 400 meters for domestic (after&#13;
desalination) and industrial/farm use. Communities in the region obtain water from a variety of sources,&#13;
including: piped water supplies to community stand pipes, yard and household connections; hand dug&#13;
wells; drilled wells with hand pumps; and open water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, and canals. More&#13;
than one source may be used by any given household. The piped water is supplied from a variety of&#13;
sources' including: Tuyamuyun reservoir, Amu Darya River, and canals; 30-40 meter wells near the river&#13;
and irrigation canals; and 300-400 meter wells with desalinization units.&#13;
6.     Official statistics indicate that about 80% of the urban population in both Karakalpakstan and&#13;
Khorezm is served by piped water supplies (mainly through stand pipes as well as yard and house&#13;
connections). In addition, 29% of the rural population in Karakalpakstan and 54% of the rural population&#13;
in Khorezm are served by piped water supplies. According to the needs assessment covering towns and&#13;
villages of less than 20,000 inhabitants, however, 85% and 91% of the urban households in&#13;
Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, respectively, are served with piped water, and 23 % and 41 % of the rural&#13;
households in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, respectively, are served.  On average, 17 %  of the&#13;
households surveyed have access to piped water from stand pipes in the street outside their yard, while&#13;
14% have piped connections in their yards and 6% have piped connections in their houses. Other sources&#13;
of household water include untreated supplies from hand pumps and shallow wells (64% of the&#13;
households) as well as canals, lakes, ponds, and rivers (26% of households surveyed). The survey also&#13;
revealed that a rural family of 7 persons uses on average 38 liters/day for drinking and cooking purposes,&#13;
and 57 liters/day for dish and clothes washing, clean up, etc., for a total household domestic consumption&#13;
of 95 liters/day, or 14 liters/person/day.&#13;
7.     These low domestic consumption rates must be contrasted with actual piped water supply figures&#13;
for various cities, towns, and villages in the region. For example, in Karakalpakistan and Khorezm,&#13;
piped water supply for households averages approximately 220 and 415 liters/person/day in urban areas.&#13;
The large discrepancy between these household supply and consumption figures are due to the high&#13;
system losses, particularly at stand pipes and yard connections which are allowed to run continuously,&#13;
and from non-domestic uses such as irrigation of household plots and livestock watering2. Currently,&#13;
some 180,000 and 200,000 m3/day are supplied to the urban areas of Karakalpakstan and Khorezm,&#13;
respectively, by piped water from the following sources: Tuyamuyun reservoir, surface water from the&#13;
Amu Darya River and irrigation canals, and 30-40 meter wells near irrigation canals. Piped water is&#13;
supplied to about 80 remote villages in Karakalpakistan from 300-400 meter wells treated by Russian built&#13;
1/ Gazprom, which operates a gas export pipeline through the region, supplies treated Amu Darya water to&#13;
towns and villages in Karakalpakstan on the left bank of the River.&#13;
2/ Approximately 24% of households surveyed are using piped water for livestock and irrigation, while 59%&#13;
use wells and hand pumps and 66% use canals, lakes, and ponds for these purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
Ekos3 electrodialysis desalinization units (310 units with a capacity of 25 cubic meters/day each). In 13&#13;
locations, however, these units are not in operation due to a lack of spare parts. And at five locations&#13;
the units are now used only for emergency purposes.&#13;
8.     Due to the limited water supply and/or water treatment capacity and the need for water&#13;
conservation, piped water is available on a 24 hour basis only in approximately 12% of the service area.&#13;
According to the results of the needs assessment, in other service areas, it is available only on an&#13;
intermittent basis, either for one or two times during the day, but usually for less than 2 hours per day&#13;
(for greater than 70% of the area served). Open water storage tanks are installed in 22% of the&#13;
households surveyed4.&#13;
9.     Water Quality. Drastic reductions in the use of mineral fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides have&#13;
occurred over the past several years as local prices have increased to world market levels. As a result,&#13;
residual levels in water supplies are usually well below the Uzbekistan water quality limits. Local surface&#13;
water sources, however, may still be contaminated by inappropriate methods of application or excessive&#13;
use of chemicals. The most immediate water quality problem in the region from a heath perspective is&#13;
pathogenic contamination from humans and livestock. Results of bacteriological analyses in the&#13;
Tuyamuyun reservoir as well as aquifers at depths of 30-40 meters and in deeper wells at 300-400 meters,&#13;
show  little contamination.   Nonetheless, the Sanitary Epidemiological Service (Sanepid) found&#13;
unacceptably high levels of bacteriological contamination in shallow wells, surface irrigation canals, and&#13;
other surface waters in the region that are used by rural communities for drinking. In areas with&#13;
intermittent piped water supplies, similar problems may exist because of the infiltration of contaminated&#13;
shallow ground water. A water quality survey of 500 handpumps (400 in Karakalpakstan and 100 in&#13;
Khorezm) indicates very high levels of salinity in the samples taken from shallow aquifers near the Aral&#13;
Sea (up to 5-7 times the National Standard of 1,000mg/1), with 50% of the samples having a salinity&#13;
higher than 2,000 mg/I, as well as bacteriological contamination of almost all samples. Contrary to&#13;
expectations, at least a half of the households do not boil their water before drinking.&#13;
10.    Due to continued leaching of salts into irrigation drainage waters throughout the Amu Darya river&#13;
system an important water quality issue in the project areas is salinity. Seasonally fluctuating salinity&#13;
levels in surface waters in the Amu Darya River and the Tuyamuyun reservoir are a cause of considerable&#13;
complaint by local consumers. Over 68% of households in the survey area complained of the salty taste&#13;
of their principal water supply5. A salinity taste tolerance survey of some 400 households in the project&#13;
area indicates that the local population will tolerate salinities up to 2,000 mg/l, above the WHO&#13;
recommended guideline limit of 1500 mg/l , but well above the National Standard of 1000 mg/l. This&#13;
3/ The Red Cross installed a modem German built 2,200 cubic meter/day reverse osmosis desalinization unit at&#13;
Takhtakupr, some 100 km northeast of Nukus in April 1993, which has only been in operation for about 10% of&#13;
the time since it was commissioned because of the high cost of operation. With the completion of the&#13;
Tuyamuyun-Nukus pipeline extension to Takhtakupr in the summer of 1994, it is no longer needed.&#13;
4/ The capacities of these tanks vary from four buckets for small sized tanks to 2 cubic meters for large tanks.&#13;
No bottled water is used in the area surveyed.&#13;
5/ Concentrations in Tuyamuyun reservoir vary from 0.6-1.6 grams/liter with the high values occurring in&#13;
February, March and April, while downstream in Khorezm and Karakalpakstan in the Amu Darya river and&#13;
irrigation canals slightly higher values are recorded. Salinity in the 3040 meter aquifers near the canals,&#13;
however, are much less variable in the range of 0.7-1.3 grams/liter. Salinity in the deep aquifer varies from 1-&#13;
3 grams/liter in eastern areas of the region and up to 30 grams/liter in the western areas of Karakalpakstan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
finding has very important cost saving implications for the project, but confirms that in certain regions&#13;
close to the Aral Sea, water supplied from shallow wells and handpumps is of an unacceptable quality&#13;
from a salinity perspective.&#13;
Government's Objectives and Strategy&#13;
11.   In the late 1980's, Government authorities in Uzbekistan launched a program to improve social&#13;
and productive infrastructure in rural communities. A major focus of this program is the provision of&#13;
safe piped drinking water. Because of the greater need for these public services and more adverse effects&#13;
of the Aral Sea disaster in the Republic of Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast, the Government has&#13;
allocated approximately 30% of its piped water program budget to this region, amounting to&#13;
approximately $130 million over five years.  Good progress has been made in achieving the&#13;
Government's goals and Phase I of this three-phase program is almost complete, although in the past two&#13;
to three years the pace of construction has decreased considerably. Recent concern over widening&#13;
inequities between urban and rural areas has led the Government to seek ways of further accelerating the&#13;
development of rural areas through the provision of social and productive infrastructure. A resolution&#13;
of the Council of Ministers to this effect was passed on January 1994, and a special working group&#13;
chaired by the first Deputy Prime Minister was created to prepare a development program up to the year&#13;
2000.&#13;
12.    The report of this group was submitted to the Council of Ministers in November 1994. The&#13;
report concludes that while Uzbekistan as a whole ranks favorably among comparable middle/lower&#13;
middle income countries, there are large geographical disparities due to the previous urban bias, and in&#13;
the rush to meet overall targets, the tendency of planners to concentrate on areas where it is easier and&#13;
less costly to provide infrastructure. This situation applied particularly to water supply and sanitation&#13;
services in the western part of the country, which includes the Republic of Karakalpakstan as well as the&#13;
Khorezm, Bukhara, and Navoi Oblasts.  The UNDP Uzbekistan Human Development Report&#13;
independently identifies similar priorities for funding by international donor agencies.&#13;
Bank's Role and Strategy&#13;
13.   The World Bank's country assistance strategy6 is designed to:  (i) support macroeconomic&#13;
stabilization and structural and sectorial reforms; (ii) strengthen market incentives, particularly in&#13;
agriculture and energy; and (iii) protect vulnerable groups through establishment of an effective safety&#13;
net and more efficient service delivery. In addition, the Bank's strategy is to provide support to ensure&#13;
or expand access to basic social services which are largely poverty focussed. Bank support also would&#13;
be directed at strengthening the Government's institutional capacity and acting as a catalyst for aid&#13;
mobilization.&#13;
14.   The Bank's role in the social infrastructure sector is to support Government efforts to improve&#13;
the health status of rural populations in the western regions of the country, which are most severely&#13;
affected by the consequences of the Aral Sea disaster and which are the most poorly served with regard&#13;
to water supply, sanitation, and hygiene. In the proposed full scale Water Supply Sanitation and Health&#13;
Project, which will be the first operation in the sector, it proposed to: (i) improve the cost effectiveness&#13;
of investments through project design; (ii) involve the participation of local stakeholders in selecting the&#13;
most efficient delivery mechanisms and in assessing their willingness and ability to pay for improved&#13;
social infrastructure; and (iii) improve the management and operation and financial viability of the&#13;

&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
regional enterprises responsible for delivering these services. As a precursor to the full scale project the&#13;
proposed Pilot Water Supply Engineering Project is designed to test and refine project management and&#13;
implementation arrangements and community participation approaches to ensure the more efficient and&#13;
timely completion of the full scale project. In addition the preparation of tender designs and tender&#13;
documents prior to negotiations for the main project will further enhance its quality and readiness for&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Lessons from Past Bank Projects&#13;
15.    Although the Government is now fully committed to implementing a comprehensive reform&#13;
program, the start-up of Bank activities in Uzbekistan has been slower than in some of the other FSU&#13;
countries. This would be the first lending operation in the social infrastructure sector in Uzbekistan.&#13;
Two other Bank projects are under implementation, the Institution Building Project and the Cotton Sub-&#13;
Sector Improvement Project. Project implementation has been delayed in both cases because of delays&#13;
in setting up the Project Implementation Units (PIUs) and the Government's preoccupation with the&#13;
transition process.&#13;
16.    Lessons highlighted by the Department's 1994 Annual Report on Portfolio Performance in Russia&#13;
and Central Asia focus on: (i) the challenge of identifying a consistent counterpart team with sufficient&#13;
authority to move the project forward; (ii) the difficulty of coordinating among key government agencies&#13;
on critical issues; (iii) the importance of setting up PIUs early in the project cycle and the training of their&#13;
staff in Bank procurement and disbursement procedures and requirements; and (iv) the importance of&#13;
involving local institutes in project design and preparation. Review of lessons learned from water supply&#13;
and sanitation projects world wide show that despite efforts at capacity building for the public institutions&#13;
concerned, few countries achieved acceptable levels of performance for their public water and sewerage&#13;
utilities, and that the financial performance of these utilities was equally poor. Some of the reasons for&#13;
these deficiencies include:  (i) lack of clear sector policies; (ii) lack of management and financial&#13;
autonomy; (iii) inexperience in project implementation; and (iv) lack of participation of users and other&#13;
stakeholders in the decision making process.&#13;
17.    To the extent possible, these lessons are being incorporated into the preparation and design of&#13;
the full scale project through: (i) an extensive social needs assessment survey, which has already been&#13;
completed with the participation of local institutes, as well as a follow up survey of water usage and&#13;
losses in piped distribution systems to domestic, commercial, and industrial consumers; (ii)&#13;
implementation of community based pilot projects for water supply and distribution7 and for health,&#13;
hygiene and sanitation8, which will be carried out during project preparation; (iii) an Interagency Working&#13;
Group has been set-up to provide overall leadership of the project, while Goskomprognostat has been&#13;
selected as the lead Government agency; (iv) a PIU is being established immediately to supervise all&#13;
project preparation and implementation activities; (v) through the PIU, the Government will execute the&#13;
7/ In addition to the larger scale water supply and distribution pilot project proposed for financing under this&#13;
engineering loan, the KfW has agreed to finance thiree or four smaller scale water supply and distribution&#13;
projects in the more remote rural areas, which will include the use of modem small scale desalination units and&#13;
packaged water treatment plants as appropriate.&#13;
8/ A PHRD grant has been obtained to finance two community based sanitation, health and hygiene pilot&#13;
projects in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast, which are being carried out by a Swiss NGO consortium. The&#13;
results of these pilot projects will be used to define the scope of, and implementation arrangements for the&#13;
sanitation and health components of the full scale project&#13;

and (vi) local institutes and NGOs will be contracted to assist in all these project preparation and design&#13;
activities.&#13;
18.   The proposed Pilot Water Supply Engineering Project will provide the Government and the Bank&#13;
with early hands-on experience in dealing with project design, management and implementation issues&#13;
and involvement of local communities under the same conditions as that of the full scale project. The&#13;
lessons gained for this experience will facilitate the implementation of the full scale project and will likely&#13;
result in improved and streamlined implementation arrangements and a more clearly defined role of the&#13;
communities in the process, allowing them to achieve the greatest possible benefits from the project.&#13;

PILOT WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING PROJECT&#13;
11. WATER SUPPLY, SANITATION AND HEALTH PROJECT&#13;
Full Scale Project Objectives&#13;
19.    The objectives of the full scale Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project, of which the&#13;
proposed pilot project represents an initial learning phase, are to: (i) improve the health of the rural&#13;
populations of the Republic of Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast through the provision of safe drinking&#13;
water, and improved hygiene education and sanitation facilities; and (ii) to strengthen institutional capacity&#13;
for the management, operation and financial performance of the regional water supply and sanitation&#13;
utilities.&#13;
Full Scale Project Description&#13;
20.    Possible components to be funded under the full scale project include:&#13;
(i)    Safe Water Supply&#13;
(a)    Water Conservation. Measures will have to be taken to reduce excessive water&#13;
losses and water consumption in the urban and rural areas already served by the&#13;
piped water distribution system. Otherwise the current system's operating and&#13;
maintenance costs will prove financially unsustainable9. This component will&#13;
possibly include, among other things: rehabilitation and system wide metering&#13;
of major trunk lines, secondary distribution systems and major end users; repair&#13;
of stand pipes and yard connections, which are allowed to flow continuously&#13;
when there is pressure in the distribution systems; and incentives to both urban&#13;
and rural households to use hand pumps, wells, or other low-cost sources of&#13;
water for use in household gardens and livestock watering. This will increase&#13;
service times, increase system pressure, and make potable water available to&#13;
other users.&#13;
(b)    Provision of Safe Piped Water Supply to Unserviced Households. This will be&#13;
achieved through the extension of secondary and tertiary water distribution&#13;
systems connected to the main Tuyamuyan-Nukus, Tuyamuyun-Urgench trunk&#13;
supply lines, or production from local fresh water aquifers of good quality (either&#13;
with or without artificial recharge); rehabilitation of existing water treatment&#13;
plants and installation of improved chlorine dosing facilities for controlling&#13;
bacteriological contamination; completion of the Kaparass reservoir pumping&#13;
station and main trunk lines to supply higher quality water during the winter&#13;
months; and installation of new desalination units and improved maintenance and&#13;
9/ The complete picture regarding the financial management of the water and sewerage utilities in the region is&#13;
only beginning to emerge, but already it is clear that substantial Central Government subsidies are being&#13;
provided to cover 0 &amp; M costs. Capital construction costs are fully subsidized by the Central Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
operation of existing Ekos desalination units in remote areas, where these are the&#13;
only economically feasible option for a safe water supply. These investments&#13;
will benefit new consumers in rural areas, as well as consumers already&#13;
connected to the existing piped water distribution network.&#13;
(ii)    Improved Sanitation, Hygiene, and Health. This will be achieved through low-cost&#13;
measures to be identified under a PHRD-funded community based pilot demonstration&#13;
project preparation activity in two rural communities in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm,&#13;
which will focus on improving household sanitation (through the development and&#13;
installation of improved latrines) and hygiene; provision of improved commercial and&#13;
public toilets (especially schools and medical facilities); and on health/hygiene&#13;
education."0 To address the need to increase income levels in the project areas, the&#13;
project will emphasize the use of labor intensive technologies and development of local&#13;
small scale contracting services.&#13;
(iii)    Technical Assistance will be provided to improve the organization, management,&#13;
operation and maintenance, and financial viability of the regional agencies responsible for&#13;
water supply, sanitation and health. Results of the vendors survey will be applied in&#13;
developing the cost recovery and incentive schemes to improve their financial viability&#13;
and efficiency and promote piped water conservation by consumers.&#13;
21.    The preparation of this project has involved extensive stakeholder consultation, household surveys&#13;
and community focus group meetings to identify stakeholder needs, priorities and constraints, which are&#13;
greatly influencing project design and implementation arrangements"1. The feasibility study for the full&#13;
scale project is currently under preparation and is expected to be completed by July 1996. On this basis&#13;
it is proposed to appraise this project in September 1996, and to present the project to the Bank's Board&#13;
in February 1997. Several donor's including the Kuwait Fund'2, KfW, OECF and JICA'3 have expressed&#13;
their interest in possibly cofinancing this project.&#13;
10/ While improved water supply is a high priority, there is very little appreciation among the communities&#13;
surveyed of the need to improve hygiene and sanitation conditions and the close linkage between these factors&#13;
and the health of their families. As recommended at the stakeholders workshop, awareness raising programs&#13;
are needed to build public support for improved sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
11/ Due to the extensive involvement of communities and other stakeholders in the preparation activities being&#13;
carried out under this project it has been included in the list of Presidential Participation Flagship Projects.&#13;
12/ The Kuwait Fund is financing the feasibility study that is being prepared for the full scale Water Supply,&#13;
Sanitation and Health Project.&#13;
13/ JICA is financing a two year study of the water supply system in six cities of the Aral Sea Region in&#13;
Uzbekistan which commenced in September 1994. This results of this study are being incorporated into the full&#13;
scale project feasibility study being prepared for the Bank and donor financing.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
REPUBLIC OF UZBEKISTAN&#13;
PILOT WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING PROJECT&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Background on the Proposed Pilot Project&#13;
22.   The Kizketken settlement is a peri-urban area, 14 km from Nukus City, just within the eastern&#13;
limits of the Nukus Metropolitan Area. At present, the total population of the settlement is about 34,000&#13;
people, including some 1,700 people relocated to the settlement from villages close to the Aral Sea over&#13;
the last two years. Of the 4,960 families living in the settlement, about 4,600 families are connected to&#13;
the piped water distribution network, which is approximately 3 years old. The houses of the remaining&#13;
340 families are located in streets without a piped water supply network. These families are mostly young&#13;
couples that have been resettled here in recent times.&#13;
23.   As shown in Table 1, the piped water supply service in the settlement is characterized by&#13;
intermittent supply and low pressure, specially in the higher elevation areas where the majority of the&#13;
population live. The water situation is even more severe for those 940 families, or 7% of the settlement&#13;
population, which are located at the far end of the piped water distribution network, or are currently not&#13;
connected. Currently, these people rely on water delivered by vendors who are supposed to obtain their&#13;
water from the main pipeline some 10-12 km from the settlement. However, in order to cut their costs&#13;
the vendors abstract untreated water from the nearby Kizketken irrigation canal and sell it to the&#13;
households as potable water. The households usually store this water in rusted metal tanks located outside&#13;
their houses. Often these tanks are shared by 4-5 families. On average, each family consumes 0.8 cubic&#13;
meter per week. Families pay for this water out of their household income at the rate of $2.8 per cubic&#13;
meter (about 10% of average household income). Due to the closing down of several local enterprises&#13;
that were manufacturing construction materials, many of the household heads are now unemployed.&#13;
However, their trade skills can be usefully employed in constructing the proposed water supply system&#13;
for the settlement, thereby providing them with at least temporary employment.&#13;
24.   Three possible water sources were considered to improve the water supply to the Kizketken&#13;
settlement. The first alternative considered withdrawing water from the Kizketken irrigation canal, 2 km&#13;
from the settlement, or from underground aquifers linked to this canal. The second option considered&#13;
abstracting water directly from the Amu Darya river, while the third option considered linking the&#13;
settlement with the Tuyamuyun-Nukus trunk supply line. Following a technical and financial evaluation&#13;
of these different options it was concluded that the main water supply pipeline was the preferred drinking&#13;
water source for the settlement.&#13;
25.   In initial meetings with the community on the design options for this pilot project, they expressed&#13;
a strong preference for a self-managed water supply scheme, because they believed the Vodokanal would&#13;
provide a poor level of service, if it was to install and manage the scheme. However, when the&#13;
community was provided with information on the advantages and disadvantages and the costs of the&#13;
various schemes they finally agreed with the experts' conclusion to link the community with the main&#13;
water supply pipeline.  This community consultation approach was a first time experience for the&#13;
Vodokanal, and while there was initially a hostile reaction from the community and much apprehension&#13;
from the Vodokanal perspective, the end result has been most beneficial for all stakeholders.&#13;

located 2 km away from the settlement, or on water delivered&#13;
by vendors and stored in unsafe containers.&#13;
Recently  1,700       340       Without piped water supply network. Families rely on the&#13;
Settled    (5.0%)               Kizketken Irrigation Canal, or on potable water delivered by&#13;
vendors.&#13;
B.    Project Objectives&#13;
26.   The main objectives of this project are to: (i) improve the design and implementation&#13;
arrangements for the full scale project through a "learning-by-doing" piloting approach and by&#13;
incorporating community participation into the planning and implementation process for water supply&#13;
and distribution; (ii) speed up implementation of the full scale project through early completion of&#13;
detailed engineering design and preparation of bidding documents; and (iii) developing and testing&#13;
joint financing and cost recovery schemes to improve the financial viability of the Vodokanals and the&#13;
sustainability of their investments.&#13;
C.     Project Description&#13;
27.   The project consists of two components: (i) an investment component to finance a pilot project&#13;
for a community based water supply and distribution scheme in Kizketken peri-urban area of Nukus&#13;
in the Republic of Karakalpakstan; and (ii) a technical assistance component for management and&#13;
supervision of pilot project implementation, and for preparation of tender designs and bidding&#13;
documents for procurement packages for the full scale project, followed by preparation of detailed&#13;
engineering designs, project management plans and implementation schedules.&#13;
(i)    Water Supply Pilot Project Component&#13;
The water supply scheme as proposed under this pilot project will involve pumping water from the&#13;
Tuyamuyun-Nukus main pipeline through a secondary main to the highest point of Kizketken village,&#13;
where it will connect with an existing tertiary distribution system supplying approximately 25,000&#13;
people in the poorly served middle and eastern sections of the settlement. In addition it will connect&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
with a new network of tertiary distribution pipelines to be constructed under the pilot project to serve&#13;
the 2,100 people (340 existing families as well as 60 new families), which have been relocated from&#13;
villages near the Aral Sea. With the support and concurrence of the community it is proposed to test&#13;
a lower water consumption design standard for water distribution networks in this settlement to reduce&#13;
investment and operating costs. The current design norm of 350 I/person/day has been reduced to&#13;
150 I/person/day. Unserviced households in the settlement that are currently supplied by water&#13;
vendors consume approximately 15 I/person/day. Households will have the choice of standpipe or&#13;
yard connections, but will pay a higher charge for the latter.&#13;
28.    Under the pilot project it is proposed to construct the following:&#13;
(a)    The Kizketken pumping station of 310 ml/hour capacity including two treated&#13;
water storage reservoirs with storage capacity of 1000 m3 each, chlorination&#13;
dosing and a transformer substation with two transformers;&#13;
(b)   the secondary trunk main of approximately 6.6 km length and 300 mm&#13;
diameter from the pumping station to the point of highest elevation in the&#13;
settlement to connect with the existing tertiary distribution network; and&#13;
(c)    new extension of the tertiary distribution system network of&#13;
approximately 5 km length and of 100 to 150 mm diameter along 6&#13;
unpaved streets to serve an additional 400 families.&#13;
(ii)    Technical Assistance Component&#13;
29.   The technical assistance component will finance the following sub-components:&#13;
(a)    Engineering design and supervision: (i) Pilot project review, revise and&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
appropriate number of contract packages according to the requirements and&#13;
procedures of the donors that will be financing these packages; prepare cost&#13;
estimates for each package; assist the PIU to review tender documents for&#13;
each contract package; prepare a detailed construction management plan for&#13;
the project; review the GIS database and project management information&#13;
system that has been developed for the proposed full scale project to assess its&#13;
completeness and recommend improvements; prepare a detailed design report&#13;
presenting the results on the above tasks. A Terms of Reference for this&#13;
assignment is given in Annex F.&#13;
The second phase of this work, which not be financed under this engineering&#13;
loan, but under the full scale project will overlap with the detailed engineering&#13;
design and will be part of the same contract. It will involve services to assist&#13;
the PIU in project management and monitoring, as well as contract bidding&#13;
and in supervising construction of facilities proposed under the project.&#13;
Details of the services to be provided in this phase of the work are described&#13;
in the Terms of Reference in Annex F.&#13;
(b)    An independent Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has been set up under&#13;
Goskomprognostat with initial financing from a Dutch Consultant Trust Fund&#13;
until the feasibility study work has been completed. The PIU will assist in the&#13;
implementation of the pilot project and continue its development and&#13;
application of a GIS management and monitoring system for the full scale&#13;
project. Following completion of the feasibility study it will also assist the&#13;
consultants in preparing the detailed engineering design and in preparation of&#13;
procurement packages for the full scale project. The PIU will also be&#13;
responsible for approving disbursements under the engineering project and for&#13;
financial management. A Terms of Reference for the operation of the PIU is&#13;
given in Annex E.&#13;
D.    Cost Estimates&#13;
30.   Total project costs, including contingencies and applicable taxes, are estimated at US$5.41&#13;
million. This estimate covers expected expenditures in foreign exchange in the order of US$3.33&#13;
million (61.7% of total costs) and expected expenditure in local currency, other than taxes, equivalent&#13;
to US$1.77 million (32.8% of total costs). Taxes (VAT) are estimated at the equivalent of US$0.30&#13;
million (5.5% of total costs). A Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No 287 of July 25, 1995 entitled&#13;
"On Measures for Further Liberalization and Perfection of Foreign Economic Relations" provides for&#13;
exemption of import duties on "goods supplied under intergovernmental or credit arrangements&#13;
concluded on behalf of the Government of Uzbekistan or against its guarantee". Table 2 summarizes&#13;
project cost estimates by component and category of expenditures. Details on project costs are given&#13;
in Annex A. The technical assistance component amounts to $3.35 million, equivalent to 61.9% of&#13;
the project costs.&#13;
31.   Cost estimates are derived from mission analysis based on discussions with Government&#13;
officials and intended project beneficiaries, as well as on detailed engineering designs for the&#13;
proposed pilot project prepared by local design institutes and revised by the Bank mission to reflect&#13;
international prices for imported goods. Base costs are expressed in January 1996 prices. Physical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
contingencies are estimated at 12% of base costs for works and equipment, and 10% for the technical&#13;
assistance components, which are in line with established Bank practice and experience under similar&#13;
projects.&#13;

E.     Project Financing&#13;
32.    The proposed Bank loan of $5.00 million will finance 100% of expected expenditures in foreign&#13;
exchange and about 80% of expected expenditures in local currency. Bank financing of incremental&#13;
expenditures in local currency is needed because the project requires substantial and rapid build up of&#13;
expenditures, which the Government is not yet able to meet. No Bank funds will be used to finance&#13;
recurrent expenditures for Government agencies involved in the project. These will be fully funded by&#13;
the Government and are not included in the cost estimates. The Bank loan to the Republic of Uzbekistan&#13;
will have a maturity of 20 years, including a 5 year grace period, at the Bank's standard variable interest&#13;
rate. The Government through Goskomprognostat, will finance about 17.0% (US$352,000), and the&#13;
beneficiary community about 2.6% (US$54,000) of the local costs of the project, including applicable&#13;
taxes. Table 3 summarizes the financing plan for the project.&#13;

33.   The community is willing and fully committed to participate in the financing of the project&#13;
investment. Community in-kind labor contribution would consist of voluntary labor for earth-moving&#13;
works and laying of distribution networks' pipes, which has been estimated at US$ 14,000-16,000. The&#13;
community would also make a cash contribution equivalent at the rate of Sum 360 per family. Thus,&#13;
community in-cash contribution would amount Sum 1.44 million, equivalent to US$ 40,000.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF UZBEKISTAN&#13;
PILOT WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING PROJECT&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    Implementation Arrangements&#13;
34.   A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has already been set up for the Water Supply, Sanitation&#13;
and Health Project with funding from a Dutch Consultants Trust Fund (CTF), which is managed by the&#13;
Bank. There are currently 5 full time local staff in the Tashkent office (located in Goskomprognostat's&#13;
office building) and two regional PIU directors in Nukus and Urgench (see Annex E for the Terms of&#13;
Reference (TOR) for these units). The Tashkent office has been fully equipped with the most modern&#13;
office and GIS equipment and provides office space and facilities for the foreign feasibility study&#13;
consultants. The Nukus office has been equipped by the Executive Committee of the Aral Sea and is&#13;
sharing its office facilities with the PIU. A regional PIU office has also been established in Urgench&#13;
and supplied with office equipment from the Dutch CTF. The national and regional PIUs will also&#13;
provide services for the implementation of the pilot project and the detailed engineering design study for&#13;
the full scale project. The PIU has been in operation since the beginning of the feasibility study in mid&#13;
November 1995. During July 1996 it is proposed to send key staff from the PIU to be trained in Bank&#13;
procurement, disbursement and financial management and reporting procedures at the Russia:&#13;
Environmental Management Project (EMP) PIU in Moscow.&#13;
35.   The feasibility study for the full scale project is being funded by a grant of KD 250,000&#13;
(approximately US$ 830,000) from the Kuwait Fund. An international consortium consisting of Binnie&#13;
and Partners, Black and Veatch and KEO won the contract in competition with six other short listed&#13;
international firms. The contract includes 35 months of foreign expert services, 150 months of local&#13;
expert services, and 150 months of support services, with the foreign firm managing the overall study.&#13;
With the assistance of Goskomprognostat, the foreign consultant firm has made effective management&#13;
coordination and task contracting arrangements with the local institutes, which is working smoothly and&#13;
efficiently. In order to ensure the rapid start up and completion of the pilot project and preparation of&#13;
tender documents for the full scale project in a timely manner, it is proposed to use the same foreign&#13;
consultant to be hired under a sole source contract. The PIU will assist with logistical and office support,&#13;
and its staff will receive on-the-job training in Bank procurement, disbursement and contracting&#13;
procedures. Agreement was reached with the borrower at negotiations on the Terms of Reference for the&#13;
engineering design and supervision consultant services. The borrower has negotiated a contract for these&#13;
services as a condition of Board presentation.&#13;
37.   A detailed implementation schedule for the proposed engineering loan is given in Annex B. As&#13;
shown in this schedule, the implementation of the pilot project is expected to take approximately 12&#13;
months, while tender designs and procurement packages for the first year's implementation of the full&#13;
scale project will be prepared by the time of project negotiations. However, the work under this contract&#13;
will proceed over a three year period with funding continuing under the main project once the engineering&#13;
loan is refinanced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B.    Procurement&#13;
38.   Goods. Goods and works will be procured in accordance with the provisions of the "Guidelines&#13;
for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the World Bank in January 1995 and&#13;
revised in January 1996. Goods contracts for the supply of pumps, valves, pipe and pipe fittings,&#13;
electrical equipment, etc to a total value of US$1,080.000 (see Table 4) will be financed under this loan.&#13;
Because of the limited availability of this equipment in Uzbekistan, goods and materials will be procured&#13;
using International Shopping procedures based on price quotations from at least three different suppliers&#13;
in two different countries. In conformity with current Bank practice the upper limit for International&#13;
Shopping contracts has been set at US$300,000.&#13;
39.   Works. Small works to be carried out under the pilot project, in packages not to exceed US$1&#13;
million, which would not be of interest to foreign contractors (in an aggregate amount not to exceed&#13;
US$980,000 would be procured under National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures. Sample bidding&#13;
documents and contracts, in accordance with IBRD policies, and based on the Bank's standard bidding&#13;
documents for small works will be used.&#13;
40.   Consultant Services. There will be one major consultant contract for consultant services (US$&#13;
3.108 million) to carry out the detailed engineering design, preparation of bidding documents and&#13;
supervision of the full scale project as well as review of detailed design, preparation of bid documents&#13;
and supervision of the pilot project. This contract will be procured on a sole source basis with the&#13;
international consultant consortium that won the feasibility study contract. The feasibility study contract&#13;
is valued at KD 250,000 (approximately US$ 830,000) and is being financed by the Kuwait Fund. The&#13;
sole sourcing of this contract can be justified for the following reasons: (i) the feasibility study consultant&#13;
was selected through an international competitive bidding process from a short list of 8 firms; (ii) the&#13;
client is fully satisfied with their performance and they are working very effectively with local institutes&#13;
and the PIU staff; (iii) the same internationally competitive fee scale will apply as previously negotiated;&#13;
(iv) the pilot project implementation and preparation of tender documents for the full scale project need&#13;
to start immediately the engineering loan becomes effective - a protracted bidding process to hire a&#13;
consultant would defeat the purpose of the engineering loan; (v) this consultant is in the best position to&#13;
apply the lessons gained from implementation of the pilot project and to prepare the tender documents;&#13;
and (vi) is familiar with World Bank and donor procurement practices. Hiring of local experts by the&#13;
PIU will be on the basis of an evaluation of CVs of at least three candidates.&#13;
41.   Prior Bank Review. The Bank will prior review all contracts for goods and works to be&#13;
procured under the proposed loan following the requirements of Appendix I of "Guildelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits". The Bank will prior review the negotiated contract&#13;
for the sole source engineering design and supervision consultant services. In addition the Bank will&#13;
review contracts for individuals hired by the PIU, which cost more than $50,000.&#13;

43.    Disbursements will be fully documented except that Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) will be&#13;
used for: (i) contracts for goods, works and consultant services costing less than US$250,000 equivalent;&#13;
and (ii) contracts for individual consultants costing less than US$50,000 equivalent.  All other&#13;
disbursements will be fully documented. Full documentation in support of SOEs will be retained by the&#13;
PIU for at least two years after disbursement. This information will be available for review by World&#13;
Bank missions during supervision and by auditors. The minimum application size for payments directly&#13;
from the loan account or for issuance of Special Commitments is 20% of the special account&#13;
authorizations. Minimum application size until aggregate disbursements reach US$1.5 million will be&#13;
US$ 20,000 and thereafter, it will be US$60,000. In order to facilitate disbursements, a Special Account&#13;
(SA) will be established by the PIU in a commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
44.    The selected bank should have: (i) a significant foreign correspondence network covering all&#13;
currencies; (ii) reasonable capacity and experience for issuing letters of credit, for making direct foreign&#13;
payments and other international transactions; (iii) the capacity to perform a wide range of banking&#13;
services, at local branches, including cash payments, transfers to other domestic banks, issuance of debit&#13;
notes, application of conversion rates from foreign currencies; (iv) the capacity to maintain adequate&#13;
accounts for the SA as required by the World Bank and provide monthly bank statements to the PIU;&#13;
willingness to issue a Comfort Letter to assure that amounts deposited in the SA will not be set off or&#13;
otherwise seized or attached to satisfy amounts due to the commercial bank by the Borrower: and (vi)&#13;
the willingness to charge competitive rates for their services and provide reasonable interest income on&#13;
balances held.  During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation of the SA would be limited&#13;
to US$ 100,000. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the loan have reached the level of&#13;
US$ 1.5 million, the initial allocation may be increased up to the authorized allocation of US$ 300,000&#13;
by submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal. Replenishment applications should be submitted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
at least every three months, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate&#13;
supporting documents.&#13;
D. Accounting&#13;
45.   The project will have sound accounting and internal controls capable of reliably recording and&#13;
reporting all financial transactions. Accounting and internal control systems acceptable to the Bank will&#13;
be put in place to allow the PIU to determine that procurement procedures are being followed and that&#13;
only eligible expenditures are included in disbursements and replenishment through the SA. This system&#13;
will be operational by the time expenditures begin. The operating procedures and manual developed&#13;
under the Russia Environmental Management Project (EMP) will be adapted for this purpose and hands-&#13;
on training of the PIU staff will be conducted in Moscow at the EMPs Center for Project Preparation and&#13;
Implementation (CPPI). This Center has trained the staff of other PlUs in Russia and is developing a&#13;
computer program suitable for Bank project accounting and for reporting of financial transactions to the&#13;
federal tax authorities. For the use of Statements of Expenditure, the PIU will process and maintain SOE&#13;
documentation. For the Special Account mechanism, the PIU and the depositary commercial bank will&#13;
introduce arrangements for proper accounting of receipts, payments, and submission of disbursement&#13;
documentation to the World Bank for replenishment of the account. During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached with the Borrower that counterpart funds for the pilot project will be deposited to the Project&#13;
Account quarterly in advance and that, as a condition of loan effectiveness a Project Account will be&#13;
opened in a commercial bank with an initial deposit of US$50,000 in the Project Account.&#13;
E Reporting&#13;
46.   The PIU is establishing a GIS based Management Information System (MIS) to track activities&#13;
under this project and the full scale project (see Annex E for the Terms of Reference). This is a powerful&#13;
tool for monitoring project implementation and project performance and will be developed by the time&#13;
this pilot project is ready for implementation. Moreover, the pilot project will test the performance of&#13;
the system and allow its refinement and improvement prior to the implementation of the full scale project.&#13;
The PIU will provide quarterly reports to the World Bank covering the financial and physical&#13;
performance of the project. The financial status will be reported through the quarterly and annual&#13;
accounts which will reflect the cash receipts from all sources and expenditures related to each component&#13;
and category, as well as the overall financial performance of the project. The detailed annual accounts&#13;
for the project will not only include expenditures directly financed by the World Bank loan, but also the&#13;
expenditures financed by the Government and the communities. These reports will reflect actual project&#13;
expenditures versus budgeted expenditures for the most recent fiscal quarter, fiscal year-to-date, and&#13;
project inception-to-date. The Project's annual audited financial statements will be prepared following&#13;
the generally accepted accounting principles as prescribed by the laws of Uzbekistan. During negotiations&#13;
agreement was reached with the borrower that not later then December 31 of each year the Project is&#13;
executed, the PIU will prepare an annual progress report, together with action plan and budget for the&#13;
following year, with recommendations for a proposed timetable for implementation, and present it to the&#13;
World Bank for its review and comments.&#13;
47.   As a Special Account and SOEs will be used in this project, the PIU will be requested to submit,&#13;
together with accounts for the project, on a quarterly basis: (i) a schedule of SOE expenditures; and (ii)&#13;
a summary of the Special Account activity and reconciliation with the SA balance in the commercial bank&#13;
account and a summary of the activity in the project account. All unaudited quarterly reports will be&#13;
submitted to reach the World Bank no later than 30 days after the end of the quarter in question.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
48.   Quarterly project reports on the physical performance of the project showing actual and planned&#13;
performance for the quarter and progress to-date will also be prepared and submitted to the Bank. These&#13;
reports, also to be submitted to reach the Bank no later than 30 days after the end of each quarter, will&#13;
include comments highlighting project progress and significant bottlenecks, showing an action plan for&#13;
remedial actions where necessary.&#13;
F. Auditing&#13;
49.   Annual reports for the project accounts, including SOEs and Special Account for each fiscal year,&#13;
will be audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by an independent auditor&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. The auditors will be appointed annually by the PIU at the beginning of each&#13;
fiscal year, so that the auditors may commence reviews sufficiently early in the fiscal year to complete&#13;
the audit in a timely manner. The auditors will prepare and submit an annual Engagement Letter, which&#13;
will be discussed and accepted by the World Bank prior to commencement of the audit. The financial&#13;
statements and the auditor's opinion and auditor's management reports, including the PIUs response to&#13;
the auditor's comments should be submitted to the World Bank no later than six months after completion&#13;
of the fiscal year in question.&#13;
G. Supervision&#13;
50.   The Bank will supervise the project four times in the first year, because of the need to learn as&#13;
much as possible from implementation of the pilot project and to finalize the detailed engineering design&#13;
of the full scale project in a timely manner. In subsequent years supervision missions will be at the rate&#13;
of three per year. In addition to the Bank missions, constant supervision will be provided by staff of the&#13;
Bank's resident mission in Tashkent, who have been actively involved in project preparation. A Bank&#13;
supervision schedule is provided in Annex G.&#13;
&#13;

H. Performance Indicators&#13;
51.   In order to more closely monitor the performance of the proposed project a set of performance&#13;
indicators have been developed as shown in Table 7. The reporting arrangements that have been agreed&#13;
with the PIU include these indicators as key factors in evaluating implementation progress and in meeting&#13;
the Government's development objectives.&#13;
Table 7: Performance Monitoring Indicators&#13;
1.  Counterpart funding of $352,000 from the Government (including VAT) and $54,000 of&#13;
cash and in-kind contributions from the beneficiary community.&#13;
2.  Bank loan funds of $5.0 million.&#13;
3.  100 person months of foreign expert, and 650 person months of local expert inputs.&#13;
4.  A water supply pumping station and reservoirs and 6.6 km of secondary mains and 5 km of&#13;
tertiary distribution networks.&#13;
5.  Piped potable water to an additional 1,700 people and improved service to 25,000 people in&#13;
Kizketken settlement.&#13;
6.  Detailed engineering designs and drawings and fully prepared bidding documents for the&#13;
full scale Water Supply, Sanitation and Health Project.&#13;
7.  Monthly water quality manitoring will be initiated in the Kizketken community immediately&#13;
to monitor effectiveness of pilot project.&#13;
8.  Piped water availability will be monitored throughout the Kizketken community, starting&#13;
immediately, to evaluate effectiveness of the project on improving service levels.&#13;
9.  Quarterly reporting of piped water tariff levels and amount of water changes collected&#13;
from the Kizketken community will be initiated immediately.&#13;
10. Advancing implementation of the full scale project by 6 months, thereby benefitting some&#13;
2.5 million people in the Aral Sea disaster area of Uzbekistan.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
REPUBLIC OF UZBEKISTAN&#13;
PILOT WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING PROJECT&#13;
V. INSTITUTIONAL AND FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A.    Institutional Overview&#13;
52.   Before independence public water supply in the cities and urban areas of Uzbekistan was under&#13;
the purview of the central organization "UzVodokanal", under the Ministry of Housing and Public&#13;
Services and partly under UztransGaz. Water supply in rural areas was mainly the responsibility of&#13;
"AgroVodokanal" under the Ministry of Agriculture.  Since independence, the major republican&#13;
legislation that have brought about substantial structural changes to organizations in charge of water&#13;
supply were the Presidential Decree "About improvement in Management of Public Utilities in the&#13;
Republic of Uzbekistan" and the Resolution (No 371 dated July 22, 1993) of the Cabinet of Ministers of&#13;
the Republic of Uzbekistan "Regarding the Issues of Organization and the activities of the Ministry of&#13;
Public Utilities of the Republic of Uzbekistan". By the Presidential Decree, the former Ministry of&#13;
Housing and Public Utilities was reorganized as the Ministry of Public Utilities (MPU) and the functions&#13;
and responsibilities of UzVodokanal were decentralized and delegated to the regional governments and&#13;
their local subordinate agencies. The parent ministry of the Vodokanals became MPU. A typical&#13;
organizational structure of the regional Vodokanals is show in Annex H. After the reorganization the&#13;
main objectives and tasks of MPU are the development and implementation of state policy for urban water&#13;
and sanitation; development of concepts, programs and strategy for expansion of water supply and&#13;
sanitation systems assistance in design construction and maintenance of networks and structures; assistance&#13;
to enterprises and agencies of MPU during transition to a market economy and gradual transformation&#13;
of these entities into joint stock and other forms of legal entities.&#13;
53.   The interregional Water Supply Pipeline Projects are managed by separate entities under MPU,&#13;
and in the project area serve both the Republic of Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast. These enterprises&#13;
are called "Entity for the Repair and Maintenance of Tuyamuyun-Nukus Interregional Water Pipeline"&#13;
and "Entity for the Repair and Maintenance of Tuyamuyun-Urgench Interregional Water Pipeline",&#13;
respectively. These entities are responsible for operating the main water supply pipelines and water&#13;
treatment plants to the region from Tuyamuyun reservoir and sell the piped water to the Vodokanals and&#13;
Agrovodokanals, which distribute the water through secondary and tertiary networks to domestic,&#13;
industrial and commercial consumers in urban and rural areas, respectively. The Vodokanals also operate&#13;
and maintain independent water supply and treatment facilities and pumping stations. All capital&#13;
construction for the main pipelines and for the distribution and treatment facilities is provided from the&#13;
central government budget. The operation and maintenance costs of the interregional pipelines are also&#13;
highly subsidized by central government.  However, the O&amp;M  costs of the Vodokanals and&#13;
Agrovodokanals is covered by cost recovery from their consumers. In the current situation the domestic&#13;
consumers are highly cross subsidized by the industrial and commercial consumers.  The highly&#13;
subsidized water supplied by the interregional pipeline entities (which is a higher cost source than from&#13;
local treatment plants) provides a perverse incentive for the Vodokanals to source their water supply from&#13;
the main pipelines, except in emergencies, rather than operating their own local facilities, even though&#13;
they could normally produce water of an acceptable quality. The Government recognizes this problem&#13;
and has adopted a policy of gradually reducing the subsidy and increasing domestic consumer tariffs.&#13;
However, as discussed below it faces certain constraints because of the poor economic conditions in this&#13;
region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
B. Financial Aspects&#13;
54.   A number of important issues relating to the full scale project design were raised by participants&#13;
at the Project Stakeholders' Workshop in Nukus from September 27-28, 1995. These issues are being&#13;
addressed by the Government and the project feasibility consultants during preparation of the project&#13;
feasibility study.&#13;
55.   Affordability. What are households in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast willing and able to&#13;
pay for clean safe water? The best evidence of an upper bound can be gained from those households that&#13;
are supplied by private water vendors. A survey of these rural or peri-urban households (which tend to&#13;
be the poorest) is currently being carried out by the team of sociologists. However, preliminary results&#13;
indicate that these households are having to pay 8-10% of their household income for delivered water,&#13;
which may not be safe and tend to consume around 15 liters/per person/day (I/p/d) for household&#13;
domestic purposes. In contrast, if they are paying at all for their piped water (50% of households&#13;
surveyed say that they are not paying for their piped water), the slightly better off consumers in urban&#13;
areas are only paying about 0.5-1.0% (at 0.1-0.2 Sum/cubic meter) of their household income for this&#13;
service. Evidence from other countries shows that consumers are willing and able to pay 3-4% of their&#13;
household income for safe piped drinking water. Therefore, even though this region is one of the poorest&#13;
areas in Uzbekistan, there is scope for increasing the water tariff to improve cost recovery for a better&#13;
supply.&#13;
56.   Level and Quality of Service. In the social surveys and community focus group meetings that&#13;
were conducted by the social survey team it is very apparent that households are demanding an improved&#13;
level and quality of service. They indicate almost no demand for hand pumps or hand-dug wells and a&#13;
high demand for piped water; either to street standpipes, or to households. They are also demanding&#13;
improved water quality (mainly taste), as well as increased delivery times and tap pressures. All of these&#13;
factors lead to increased capital costs for construction, as well as increased operations and maintenance&#13;
(O&amp;M) costs.&#13;
57.    Water Conservation. In the absence&#13;
of adequate controls on water consumption,&#13;
excessive water losses in distribution systems  12   10.42&#13;
and water usage by consumers in urban areas     10_&#13;
is contributing substantially to the high cost&#13;
of the schemes for piped water supply in the&#13;
region. Water supply rates of 500-700 I/p/d          ..                      TWA,C&#13;
are common for these urban areas, even&#13;
though the Vodokanals are trying to limit        2&#13;
this excessive water usage through restricting   0&#13;
pressures in supply mains and limiting             1 2 3  4 5  6  7  8&#13;
service times to as low as 2-4 hrs per day in               Zones&#13;
some areas (see Figure 1 from the social&#13;
survey).   It is common  to  see yard&#13;
connections and even standpipes without taps&#13;
running freely. Due to poor maintenance of service mains pipe leaks are common. Apartment basements&#13;
are generally flooded as a result of pipe leaks and poorly designed and constructed sewage collector&#13;
systems. Residents on the higher floors of apartment buildings often do not receive any piped water.&#13;
Because of the low tariffs and poor rate of collection there is no incentive for the household consumers&#13;
to conserve water. They use large quantities to water gardens and livestock and allow yard connections&#13;
to run freely.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

58.   If these urban consumers could be convinced of the necessity to conserve piped water and the&#13;
Vodokanal had the resources to fix leaking pipes, then a considerable amount of water could be freed up&#13;
to supply other consumers at low capital costs. This option is being considered in developing the revised&#13;
masterplan for water supply in the region. Investments will be required in urban areas to rehabilitate&#13;
leaking distribution pipes and in apartments and households to reduce avoidable water losses. Household&#13;
consumers will have to be educated to use water properly and efficiently. Community water user&#13;
associations will be established to promote water conservation and water loss reduction and to facilitate&#13;
tariff collection.&#13;
59.   As a demonstration, in the newly serviced areas to be financed under the pilot project water&#13;
metering of small groups of households, which will be organized as Water User Associations, will be&#13;
used as the basis for charging consumers for the actual amount of water consumed. Water tariffs will&#13;
be set at a level which will discourage wastage, and community pressure will encourage households to&#13;
pay for the water that they consume. Similar arrangements should be implemented in areas that are&#13;
already serviced by the piped water network. Metering of apartment blocks will also be considered in&#13;
the full scale project taking into account the full cost of metering (ie the meter cost, installation cost,&#13;
maintenance cost, and cost of reading and billing).&#13;
60.   Setting Water Tariff Levels.  The major constraint to increasing water tariff levels in&#13;
Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast will be the affordability of clean water supply to consumers, which&#13;
from discussions with communities and community leaders seems to fall in the range 3-4% of household&#13;
income. The social surveys show that rural consumers are even willing to pay for vendor supplied water&#13;
at prices above what is considered affordable for them (ie at 8-9% of household income). Rural&#13;
households earning approximately $25 per month (825 Sum per month) could only be expected to afford&#13;
to pay approximately 25-34 Sum per month for an adequate clean water supply. However, in&#13;
consultations with communities in setting up the pilot water supply projects they have indicated that 100&#13;
i/p/d would meet their domestic needs (at the present they are consuming only 15 I/p/d for essential&#13;
household needs obtained from vendors, hand pumps, or hand-dug wells). Thus an average household&#13;
of 7 people would consume 21 cubic meters per month, and would be able to pay between 1.2 and 1.6&#13;
Sum per meter16. The current tariff for piped water is 0.1-0.2 Sum per cubic meter, based on an assumed&#13;
water usage of 250 l/p/d. This translates into a monthly water charge of 5.25-10.5 Sum per month for&#13;
each household in urban areas, compared with an affordability level of greater than 30 Sum per month.&#13;
It should be noted that at present households pay much more for vendor's water in those communities&#13;
that do not have access to piped water. There is, therefore, further scope for increasing water tariffs in&#13;
already serviced urban areas and considerable scope for increasing household tariff collection rates&#13;
provided adequate safe water is supplied&#13;
61.    Cost Recovery and System Sustainability. It is estimated that the actual O&amp;M cost of supplying&#13;
piped water to Karakalparstan and Khorezm Oblast from Tuyamuyun reservoir, is approximately 6 Sum&#13;
per cubic meter (made up of a charge of 4 Sum per cubic meter to operate the main pipelines from&#13;
Tuyamuyun reservoir and 2 Sum per cubic meter for the local distribution networks). Table 8 shows that&#13;
at current levels of household income in the rural areas in this region (ie 825 Sum per month) households&#13;
can only afford to purchase approximately 27 I/p/d at a tariff of 6 Sum per cubic meter. For example,&#13;
at the currently assumed consumption rate in urban areas of 250 I/p/d, consumers would only be able to&#13;
cover approximately 10% of total O&amp;M costs, if they were charged a tariff equivalent to 4% of their&#13;
16/ Note that if the tariff is based on an assumed household consumption rate of 250 I/p/d in rural areas the&#13;
affordable water tariff would be reduced to 0.4-0.64 Sum per cubic meter. At this lower tariff level there&#13;
would be less incentive to conserve water, if measured consumption rates are used as the basis for charging&#13;
households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
household income. At the current tariff of 0.1-0.2 Sum per cubic meter and an assumed consumption&#13;
rate of 250 I/p/d household consumers are only covering less than 1 % of total O&amp;M costs.&#13;
62.    There is scope for increasing tariffs and reducing consumption in already serviced areas without&#13;
an adverse impact on the additional economic benefits derived from access to piped water. How much&#13;
consumption can be reduced without adverse impact on these additional benefits, and if these benefits&#13;
outweigh the cost of providing the piped water has yet to be assessed in the economic analysis to be&#13;
carried out under the feasibility study for the full scale project. For the newly serviced rural areas it&#13;
appears necessary to reduce service level norms for piped water supplies to approximately 100-150 I/p/d&#13;
and to consider other lower cost options as proposed in the pilot project, which may increase the level&#13;
of cost recovery for O&amp;M costs. However, if design consumption rates are set too low some consumers&#13;
may not receive sufficient water, whereas others use somewhat more.&#13;

*   Equivalent to $25/month at an exchange rate of $1 = 33 Sum&#13;
63.    Government Subsidies.  It is clear from  the above that the cost of properly operating and&#13;
maintaining the piped water supply system in the region will depend on government subsidies into the&#13;
foreseeable future. On the basis of a current piped water supply from Tuyamuyun reservoir'7 of 170,000&#13;
and 200,000 cubic meters per day to Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast respectively (of which&#13;
approximately 40% is supplied to household consumers and 60% to industrial and commercial&#13;
enterprises), the current subsidy amounts to 325 million Sum per year ($9.8 million per year) for the&#13;
domestic consumers. The other 60% supplied to the industrial and commercial enterprises almost covers&#13;
full O&amp;M costs at current tariff levels. A continuing subsidy for household consumption would be&#13;
appropriate because of the very low incomes in the region, and because of the adverse effects on water&#13;
quantity and quality due to upstream economic activities. Even if it is proposed to undertake very large&#13;
investments to control upstream irrigation drainage discharges to the Amu Darya, and to release&#13;
increasing  quantities of water to the Aral Sea, it will take at best 3-S years (if natural depressions are used&#13;
for intermediate storage along the collector) and 10-15 years for these investments to have a beneficial&#13;
impact on water quality in the downstream reaches of the river.&#13;
17! This is not the total supply as other sources are used tO supplement the Tuyamuyun reservoir supply,&#13;
especially during the sumnmer months when the demandl reaches its peak.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
64.    Community Consultation and Ownership. Experience from World Bank rural water supply and&#13;
sanitation projects in other countries indicate that when projects are based on inflexible service level&#13;
norms many consumers were alienated, because the services provided did not match what they wanted&#13;
and were able and willing to pay for. The best results were achieved where communities were fully&#13;
consulted regarding their preferred water supply options, based on good information on technical and&#13;
financial matters, and where these communities were fully involved in project design and implementation.&#13;
In many cases community water user associations were formed to make decisions and take actions on&#13;
service levels, affordable tariffs, collection of water charges, surveying of water leaks and overall&#13;
supervision, etc. They also exerted pressure on Water Utilities to maintain water distribution systems&#13;
and to improve the quality of service.&#13;
65.    The existing structure of community committees in the region readily allows the formation of&#13;
community water user associations, as demonstrated during the preparation of this pilot water supply&#13;
project. In the preparation process the communities have been thoroughly informed on various options&#13;
for water supply and distribution, as well as the cost and financing implications. Their views on&#13;
affordability and level of service have influenced the selection and design of appropriate systems. In&#13;
addition their commitment to project financing with initial cash contributions and in-kind labour&#13;
contributions to finance the capital costs and agreements to contribute to O&amp;M costs to affordable levels&#13;
have considerably increased their ownership of these projects. As a result the water that they use will&#13;
have a real economic value to them and will contribute to the sustainability of the systems that are&#13;
installed.&#13;

PILOT WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING PROJECT&#13;
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
66.   The main benefit of and reason for implementing the pilot water supply project for Kizketken&#13;
settlement is to "learn-by-doing", while providing for immediate and visible results in area that has been&#13;
severely affected by the Aral Sea disaster. Since this is the first time that the Bank and other potential&#13;
co-financers have been involved in the water supply sector in Uzbekistan, there is much to learn&#13;
regarding local engineering design and cost estimating standards and practices, availability and quality&#13;
of civil engineering contracting organizations, supervision of construction, materials and equipment&#13;
procurement from local and foreign suppliers, importing of foreign goods and customs clearance&#13;
procedures, etc. The early identification of constraints and means of overcoming difficulties experienced&#13;
in the pilot project will greatly assist in the design of the implementation arrangements for the full scale&#13;
project. The pilot project will also test community involvement on a substantial scale and allow the&#13;
development of mechanisms to ensure that the most important stakeholders are involved in the decision&#13;
making throughout the process from detailed design through to construction and operation of the facilities.&#13;
This will improve cooperation between the service provider and the project beneficiaries and ownership&#13;
of the project by the beneficiary community. Higher levels of cost recovery have been agreed with the&#13;
communities and sustainability of the project in the longer term is, therefore, more likely. The more&#13;
direct and immediate benefit will be employment for locally unemployed construction workers in the&#13;
settlement and improved water supply and health conditions for some 34,000 people.&#13;
67.    Funding of the detailed engineering designs and preparation of bidding documents for the full&#13;
scale project under the engineering loan will considerably speed up the implementation of the main&#13;
project, as the bidding documents will be available for distribution before the main loan becomes&#13;
effective. This will bring forward project implementation by at least 6 months. It will also provide&#13;
considerable training to the staff of the PIU in procurement and disbursement procedures and preparation&#13;
and upgrading of the Project Management Information and Monitoring System, which will be used to&#13;
constantly track progress on the main project, as well as the pilot project.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
68.    Because of the small scale of the pilot project the risks are minimal, although delays are to be&#13;
expected. However, in order to further reduce risks of delays, it is proposed to employ an experienced&#13;
foreign firm to work with the PIU staff and local design institutes to review detailed engineering designs&#13;
and to supervise procurement and contracting procedures, so that they conform with Bank requirements.&#13;
It is proposed to contract the same consultant firm that is working on the project feasibility study in order&#13;
to speed up the implementation of the pilot project and to facilitate incorporating lessons learned into the&#13;
design of the implementation arrangements for the full scale project. The impact of any delays in&#13;
completing the detailed engineering designs and procurement packages will be minimized by developing&#13;
a detailed implementation plan and concentrating the initial efforts on the facility designs that fall on the&#13;
critical path of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
C.    Environmental Assessment&#13;
69.   The proposed pilot project for water supply is not expected to have any adverse environmental&#13;
impacts. Only small scale construction activities are included in the project including small diameter&#13;
pipeline trench digging, water holding tanks,  and a pump house.  The project has been rated&#13;
Environmental Category "C".&#13;

PILOT WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX E&#13;
PART A: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION UNIT&#13;
1.    The Project Implementation Consultant Group (PICG) has been set-up under Goskomprognstat. It&#13;
will be responsible for project preparation and implementation and will have three offices in Tashkent, Nukus&#13;
and Urgench. The office in Nukus will be jointly operated and equipped by the EC of the Aral Sea. Office&#13;
equipment for the Tashkent and Urgench offices has been provided by a Dutch Consultant Trust Fund in the&#13;
World Bank. This fund will also be used to finance the operation of the Group for the 12 month preparation&#13;
phase of the project and subsequently it will be financed under the project.&#13;
2.    The PICG will provide the following services to Goskomprognostat in regard to project preparation&#13;
and implementation:&#13;
(a)    Liaison;&#13;
(b)    Procurement;&#13;
(c)    Disbursement;&#13;
(d)    Development and operation of GIS Project design and management system&#13;
(e)    Reporting, Accounting and Auditing:&#13;
(f)   Information exchange; and&#13;
(g)    Policies concerning the above.&#13;
3.    Liaison: The PICG will provide liaison with donors, ministries, other public entities NGOs and the&#13;
public on project activities. Such liaison will include facilitating the interaction of concerned entities and&#13;
the provision of information as described in paragraph 10.&#13;
4.    In this regard, the PICG will be the consolidated repository for project information and data which&#13;
it will make available to concerned entities in appropriate formats.  Also the PICG will assist&#13;
Goskompnogstat in organizing and coordinating seminars and workshops to disseminate project progress,&#13;
results and lessons learned, both for the Government of Uzbekistan, NGO and public audiences, and for&#13;
interested donors and suppliers of goods and services.&#13;
5.    Procurement: The PICG will have general responsibility for the administration of the procurement&#13;
of equipment, goods and services required for the project. In undertaking procurement of equipment and&#13;
goods, the PICG will follow the World Bank Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits and, for selecting and employing professional services, will follow the Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency. The specific&#13;
responsibilities and arrangements for procurement will be as follows:&#13;
(i)    Equipment and Goods: The PICG will have the responsibility for procuring all the&#13;
equipment required for the project. In general, the equipment to be procured will follow&#13;
the lists given in the Procurement Annex to the IBRD Staff Appraisal Report (SAR).&#13;
However, as project preparation and implementation progresses there may be amendments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
to these lists. The PICG should consolidate the lists, prepare specifications and confirm with&#13;
design consultants and project managers, that the specifications meet the needs of the project&#13;
component. Wherever possible, equipment needs should be combined in packages with ICB&#13;
being used for all packages with estimated values over a to be specified threshold value.&#13;
Some equipment will be required later in the project cycle and if the equipment&#13;
specifications are agreed, then the PICG should use its best judgement to determine whether:&#13;
(a) to include this as part of early packages with delayed delivery timed to best meet the&#13;
needs of the project; (b) procure with the bulk of the equipment and either store or deliver&#13;
early to the appropriate agency (bearing in mind possible security risks); or (c) whether to&#13;
procure the equipment separately when needed. Packages with an estimated value under the&#13;
ICB threshold may be procured through International Shopping. "National shopping" may&#13;
be used for supplies and minor items readily available locally and, where bulk procurement&#13;
would not be more economical;&#13;
(ii)    The selection and employment of professional services: The PICG will act as a service&#13;
agency and facilitator for the selection and employment of professional services. Such&#13;
services may be provided from foreign and Uzbekistan sources by: (a) consulting firms and&#13;
individuals and (b) Institutes. The PICG can hire consultants to assist its work and can assist&#13;
Goskomprognostat in preparing invitation packages, selecting consultants and negotiating&#13;
contracts with consultant firms which will be hired by Goskomprognostat.  Selection of&#13;
consulting firms will be through evaluation of proposals received from a shortlist of firms&#13;
(not less than three, no more than six). Selection of individuals will be through the&#13;
evaluation of at least three CVs. The PICG will provide support to Goskomprognostat by&#13;
assisting in the preparation of long lists of firms from which the Goskomprognostat will&#13;
choose the short list. Selection committees will usually be convened by Goskomprognostat.&#13;
While the PICG will be represented on selection committees, the majority of&#13;
Goskomprognostat members should be involved with project implementation. The PICG&#13;
will handle the mailing of the invitation package to the shortlisted firms and receiving and&#13;
recording the proposals. Given its rapid build up of experience, the PICG should jointly&#13;
with the Goskomprognostat, negotiate contracts with the consulting firms.  Individual&#13;
contracts will be negotiated on the basis of a standard scale of salaries and conditions. For&#13;
both firms and individuals, standard contracts will be used. For firms this will be the World&#13;
Bank Standard Contract; for individuals, the standard individual contract of the PICG;&#13;
(iii)   Training and Advice: Based on the Bank's guidelines, the PICG will prepare a procurement&#13;
manual which should amplify the procedures given in the Guidelines and explain in detail&#13;
the responsibilities and procedures to be followed by the Project Implementation Agencies.&#13;
The PICG will also provide training in professional services selection and contract&#13;
administration. The PICG will maintain a library of terms of reference, job descriptions, and&#13;
contract documentation and will build up a data base of information on consulting firms and&#13;
equipment suppliers. The PICG will also assist in the administrative matters related to&#13;
training workshops to be mounted by the Project Implementing Agencies and with training&#13;
and secondments overseas; and&#13;
(iv)   World Bank's Prior Review: The Bank's review for procurement of equipment and goods&#13;
for all contracts over the ICB threshold is detailed in Appendix 1 to the Procurement&#13;
Guidelines i.e. the Bank would need to review and give its no objections to the complete bid&#13;
package prior to bids being invited (including the proposed advertisement) and the proposed&#13;
contract award with a detailed report covering bid opening and evaluation. For professional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
services where firms or institutes are being invited, the Bank would need to give its "no&#13;
objections" to the short list of firms to be invited to submit proposals and the invitation&#13;
package. Prior to negotiation, the Bank would wish to receive the recommendations of the&#13;
evaluation committee with the winning proposal, and the proposed negotiated contract prior&#13;
to signature.&#13;
6.    Disbursement: The PICG will be responsible for the disbursement of funds, the preparation of&#13;
withdrawal applications and the collection, maintenance of all relevant documents. The Bank's Disbursement&#13;
Handbook which details disbursement procedures for IBRD Loans, provides the information on procedures&#13;
and should be considered a part of these Terms of Reference. Withdrawal applications will be fully&#13;
documented, except for expenditures against contracts less than US$50,000 equivalent, which will be made&#13;
on certified Statements of Expenditures detailing the individual transactions. The documents to support these&#13;
expenditures will be retained by the PICG for at least one year after the receipt by the Bank of the audit&#13;
report for the year in which the last disbursement was made. This documentation will be made available&#13;
for review by the auditors (see section below on "Reporting, Accounting and Auditing") and the Bank upon&#13;
request.&#13;
7.    GIS Based Project Design and Management System: Because of the large area involved by the&#13;
project and need for effective up-to-date project monitoring and evaluation, a GIS based project design and&#13;
management system will be developed and operated by PICG. A special computer and ancillary equipment&#13;
system has been purchased and dedicated to this purpose. The entire network of water supply and&#13;
distribution network, which have already been installed will be overlayed or detailed maps of the region as&#13;
well as those that are planned for construction under project. Water supply sources, water quality data,&#13;
demographic and socio-economic data, etc. will also be incorporated into the database. Project cost and&#13;
scheduling data will also be incorporated as it becomes available, so that a complete project management&#13;
system is developed with regular summary progress reporting produced automatically and graphically.&#13;
During project implementation this will also be converted into a tool for operational management to improve&#13;
the operation and maintenance of the water supply network in the region.&#13;
8.    Financial Reporting, Accounting and Auditing: The PICG will establish a management information&#13;
system which, at a minimum, will cover:&#13;
(a)    All equipment and goods procurement activities;&#13;
(b)    All consultants and personnel employed under the Project;&#13;
(c)    All financial activities including payments and disbursements; and&#13;
(d)    An accounting system following generally accepted international standards in order to&#13;
provide information on the receipt and use of funds and in line with the terms of the Loan&#13;
Agreement. The system would ensure timely and accurate accounting of all transactions&#13;
under the Loan, and a clear presentation of financial information. It should enable&#13;
identification of the use of all funds by components and categories of equipment and goods&#13;
procured and consultants and personnel employed and paid under the project.  The&#13;
accounting system should reflect the movement and receipts and payments through the&#13;
Special Account with balances agreed with monthly financial statements form the holding&#13;
commercial bank and with periodic statements from the World Bank; and&#13;
(e)    An auditing system to meet the requirements of the Government of Uzbekistan and the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
9.    Detailed requirements for the above, including the determination of responsibilities for the provision&#13;
of data and reports on subprojects, will be developed during the 9 month start-up phase of the PICG.&#13;
10.   Information Exchange: The PICG will ensure the organization and management of information&#13;
reporting and database maintenance to meet the needs of the project and donors and lenders participating in&#13;
the project. Information management will include that developed by the systems in paragraph 7 above and&#13;
will also include written reports, both as specified under the Loan Agreement, but also as required for the&#13;
dissemination of information to entities of the Government of Uzbekistan, donors and to the participants in&#13;
the project.&#13;
11.   Employment of Personnel: The PICG will develop personnel employment policies to ensure&#13;
appropriate consistency by all the project participants. Over and above the employment activities as indicated&#13;
in paragraph 4 above, the PICG will engage individual experts for the purpose of staffing the PICG.&#13;
12.   Development of PICG Policies and Procedures: The detailed functions of the PICG and its&#13;
structure, policies and operations will evolve over time -- particularly during the start-up phase. These&#13;
Terms of Reference provide a starting point for the PICG operations. However, it is expected that they will&#13;
be revised, amplified and amended from time to time to more adequately meet the needs of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
PART B: TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
FOR GIS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM&#13;
Background&#13;
1.     Since the proposed project covers such a large area with many scattered cities, towns and villages&#13;
there is a need to develop an effective tool for data compilation, storage and display in a format that can be&#13;
readily adjusted and presented for effective decision making and reporting. In addition it is likely that there&#13;
will be at least 3 or 4 donors that will be financing varying components or bid packages under the project,&#13;
each having its own special data presentation and reporting requirements. A system that has now been&#13;
widely used to meet the needs of such projects is a Windows based computerized GIS , of which there are&#13;
several widely available commercial software packages. The one which is particularly suited to this&#13;
application is Atlas GIS. As with all of these systems Atlas GIS allows the user to input, overlay and&#13;
manipulate geographic data in the form of maps, pipeline networks, etc., as well as numerical data of all&#13;
types and applications. The systems allows great flexibility in regard to meeting special requirements of end&#13;
users and can be continually upgraded to meet changing requirements as a project passes through varying&#13;
phases of development and implementation.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
2.     The objectives of the GIS to be developed for this project are to provide a management decision&#13;
making and operational tool to: (i) facilitate project design; (ii) project management and reporting during&#13;
implementation; and (iii) improve operation and maintenance of the entire water supply network. These&#13;
three objectives have common basic requirements for system design, as well as their own specific&#13;
requirements. At this stage it is not possible to identify all of these requirements, so that this TOR is only&#13;
indicative of the developments that will be carried out to make the system fully operational.&#13;

Detailed Task Descriptions&#13;
I.     Finalize fiunctional requirements.&#13;
9.     The information systems specialists assisting the Project Implementation Consulting Group will be&#13;
responsible for developing, operating and maintaining an appropriate information management and retrieval&#13;
system capable of serving the needs described in previous sections. Their first task will be to finalize the&#13;
detailed list of requirements of the various aspects of the system, as initially outlined above with the project&#13;
feasibility consultants, the public utilities, main pipeline operators, Goskomprognostat and other concerned&#13;
parties. Through a process which may involve client interviews or workshops the IT specialists should carry&#13;
out:&#13;
*      an identification of all organizational units which will contribute to and benefit from the&#13;
development of the information systems;&#13;
*      an assessment of the volume and flow of geo-referenced data to be utilized&#13;
*      an inventory and assessment of the quality of the and availability of map data sources;&#13;
*      an inventory and assessment of existing staff skills and additional training requirements under&#13;
the project; and&#13;
*      identification of major gaps in the availability of map or other critical data;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
*1.     Conduct demonstration studies for design phase&#13;
10.    As an initial step the information technology specialists shall develop a system which can be used in&#13;
the project design phase. Prior to spending a great deal of effort on database development, the IT specialists&#13;
should undertake a number of operational case studies to illustrate how the system will be used to solve&#13;
identified problems during the planning and design phase of the project. Prior to full scale implementation&#13;
of systems these case studies should be evaluated and revised as appropriate. The objective of this step is to&#13;
insure that operational procedures are tested and evaluated before full scale implementation of the databases&#13;
begins. Based on the results of the evaluation phase a detailed implementation plan will be developed.&#13;
11.    Oversee full scale system development and implementation&#13;
11.    Following an initial evaluation of system  requirements and a brief demonstration phase the IT&#13;
specialists will prepare a detailed system design and implementation strategy for review and refinement in&#13;
discussion with representatives of the relevant data users and provider organizations. The system development&#13;
strategy should be phased and modular allowing the system to be expanded as required'. During the system&#13;
implementation stage all databases will be developed. During implementation the system will be adapted and&#13;
modified for operation by the water and sewage utilities and main pipeline operators to improve operation and&#13;
maintenance of the water supply and sewage networks. The information technology specialists will oversee&#13;
the full scale implementation of the system including database design, development, staff training, and&#13;
monitoring of system performance.&#13;
Reporting&#13;
12.    An important purpose of the GIS will be to produce timely summary reports, maps and presentations&#13;
for Government and public utility decision makers and for donors providing finance for the project. The&#13;
system needs to be designed and developed with this important objective in clear perspective.&#13;
i The initial recommended software configuration should be compatible with the Windows 95 operating system. As a&#13;
minimum software functionality should include: the latest version of a commercially available PC based GlS/Mapping software&#13;
(e.g., Atlas GIS), a project scheduling package (e.g. Microsoft Project), a simple accounting system (e.g. Quicken ) for project&#13;
accounting and finacial reporiing, and other ancillary database management software (e.g. Access) as required.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
REPUBLIC OF UZBEKISTAN&#13;
PILOT WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX F&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
ENGINEERING DESIGN AND SUPERVISION CONSULTANT&#13;
Background: General&#13;
1.    At a meeting of the Heads of Governments of the five Aral Sea states in February 1994, it was&#13;
decided to include the Uzbekistan Rural Water Supply, Sanitation, and Health Project in the Aral Sea Program&#13;
presented to an international donor's conference held in Paris in June 1994. At this conference, it was decided&#13;
that the World Bank would take the lead in preparing a project focusing on the two regions of Uzbekistan most&#13;
severely affected by the Aral Sea disaster: the Republic of Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Oblast.&#13;
2.     The Republic of Uzbekistan is the most populated of the four Central Asian Republics with a&#13;
population of 22.2 million, of which some 60% live in rural communities. Agriculture is the predominant&#13;
economic activity in this semi-arid country. Only 10% of the land is cultivated, of which 95% is irrigated&#13;
by two major river systems: the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, both of which flow into the Aral Sea. Since&#13;
the 1960s, increasing use of these rivers for agriculture, particularly cotton growing, has resulted in greatly&#13;
reduced volumes of run off entering the Aral Sea and excessive contamination from leached salts and&#13;
agricultural chemicals.&#13;
Background: Aral Sea Disaster Region&#13;
3.     Population. Uzbekistan comprises 12 provinces (oblasts) as well as the Republic of Karakalpakstan,&#13;
and includes 123 cities and 157 rural regions. Karakalpakstan encompasses 37% of the land area of the&#13;
Republic and has a population of 1.37 million, most of whom occupy the Amu Darya delta. Approximately&#13;
50% live in very small rural communities associated with state and collective farms. By contrast, Khorezm&#13;
Oblast occupies only 1.4% of the land area of the Republic, but due to intensive cultivation and irrigation,&#13;
it supports an almost similar size population of 1.17 million, of which more than 75% live in very small rural&#13;
communities. The ethnic structure of the populations in the two regions also are quite different from each&#13;
other with Karakalpakstan consisting of almost equal numbers of Uzbeks, Karakalpaks, and Kazakhs, while&#13;
95% of the population in Khorezm are Uzbeks. The average family size in Karakalpakstan is 7.6 compared&#13;
to 7.1 in Khorezm (both are above the national average of 6.9%).&#13;
4.     Socio Economic Conditions. Karakalpakstan is the poorest region of Uzbekistan with a significant&#13;
percentage of the population living below poverty level. The most striking result of the recent needs&#13;
assessment survey of 951 rural and urban households representing 100 communities in the region indicates&#13;
that 93% and 78% of the family budget is spent on food in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, respectively.&#13;
Average monthly family income in November 1994 from all sources, including garden plots and livestock was&#13;
567 sum (US$23) and 695 sum (US$28). Another key finding of the needs assessment was that the majority&#13;
of households (about 65%) mentioned lack of food, particularly flour, as their most important problem, about&#13;
59% of the households mentioned that lack of money to buy food products was their second most important&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
problem and about 25 % said that their third most important problem was lack of water. Notwithstanding the&#13;
poor economic conditions, only 4% of the households surveyed expressed a desire to leave the area.&#13;
5.     Water Supply System. Because of the low rainfall (about 110 mm/year), water supply in the region&#13;
depends almost entirely on the Amu Darya River and its system of irrigation canals; the one exception being&#13;
deep saline ground water from wells drilled down to 400 meters for domestic (after desalination) and&#13;
industrial/farm use. Communities in the region obtain water from a variety of sources, including: piped water&#13;
supplies to community stand pipes, yard and household connections; hand dug wells; drilled wells with hand&#13;
pumps; and open water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, and canals. More than one source may be used by any&#13;
given household. The piped water is supplied from a variety of sources' including: Tuyamuyun reservoir,&#13;
Amu Darya River, and canals; 30-40 meter wells near the river and irrigation canals; and 300-400 meter wells&#13;
with desalinization units.&#13;
6.     Official statistics indicate that about 80% of the urban population in both Karakalpakstan and Khorezm&#13;
is served by piped water supplies (mainly through stand pipes as well as yard and house corrections). In&#13;
addition, 29% of the rural population in Karakalpakstan and 54% of the rural population in Khorezm are&#13;
served by piped water supplies. According to the needs assessment covering towns and villages of less than&#13;
20,000 inhabitants, however, 85% and 91 % of the urban households in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm,&#13;
respectively, are served with piped water, and 23% and 41 % of the rural households in Karakalpakstan and&#13;
Khorezm, respectively, are served. On average, 17% of the households surveyed have access to piped water&#13;
from stand pipes in the street outside their yard, while 14% have piped connections in their yards and 6%&#13;
have piped connections in their houses. Other sources of household water include untreated supplies from&#13;
hand pumps and shallow wells (64% of the households) as well as canals, lakes, ponds, and rivers (26% of&#13;
households surveyed). The survey also revealed that a rural family of 7 persons uses on average 38 liters/day&#13;
for drinking and cooking purposes, and 57 liters/day for dish and clothes washing, personal washing, etc.,&#13;
for a total household domestic consumption of 95 liters/day, or 14 liters/person/day.&#13;
7.     These low domestic consumption rates must be contrasted with actual piped water supply figures for&#13;
various cities, towns, and villages in the region. For example, in Karakalpakistan and Khorezm, piped water&#13;
supply for households averages approximately 220 and 415 liters/person/day in urban areas. The large&#13;
discrepancy between these household supply and consumption figures are due to the high system losses,&#13;
particularly at stand pipes and yard connections which are allowed to run continuously, and from non-domestic&#13;
uses such as irrigation of household plots and livestock watering3. Currently, some 180,000 and 200,000&#13;
m3/day are supplied to the urban areas of Karakalpakstan and Khorezm, respectively, by piped water from&#13;
the following sources: Tuyamuyun reservoir, surface water from the Amu Darya River and irrigation canals,&#13;
and 30-40 meter wells near irrigation canals. Piped water is supplied to about 80 remote villages in&#13;
Karakalpakistan from 300-400 meter wells treated by Russian built Ekos4 electrodialysis desalinization units&#13;
(310 units with a capacity of 25 cubic meters/day each) at 80 village locations. In 13 locations, however,&#13;
2 Gazprom, which operates a gas export pipeline through the region, supplies treated Aniu Darya water to&#13;
towns and villages in Karakalpakstan on the left bank of the River.&#13;
3 Approximately 24% of households surveyed are using piped water for livestock and irrigation, while 59%&#13;
use wells and hand pumps and 66 % use canals, lakes, and ponds for these purposes.&#13;
4 The Red Cross installed a modem German built 2,200 cubic meter/day reverse osmosis desalinization unit&#13;
at Takhtakupr, some 100 km northeast of Nukus in April 1993, which has only been in operation for about 10%&#13;
of the time since it was commissioned because of the high cost of operation. With the completion of the&#13;
Tuyamuyun-Nukus pipeline extension to Takhtakupr in the summer of 1994, it is no longer needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
these units are not in operation due to a lack of spare parts. And at five locations the units are now used only&#13;
for emergency purposes.&#13;
8.     Due to the limited water supply and/or water treatment capacity and the need for water conservation,&#13;
piped water is available on a 24 hour basis only in approximately 12% of the service area. According to the&#13;
results of the needs assessment, in other service areas, it is available only on an intermittent basis, either for&#13;
one or two times during the day, but usually for less than 2 hours per day (for greater than 70% of the area&#13;
served). Open water storage tanks are installed in 22% of the households surveyed5.&#13;
9.      Water Qua&amp;iy. Drastic reductions in the use of mineral fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides have&#13;
occurred over the past several years as local prices have increased to world market levels. As a result,&#13;
residual levels in water supplies are usually well below the Uzbekistan water quality limits. Local surface&#13;
water sources, however, may still be contaminated by inappropriate methods of application or excessive use&#13;
of chemicals. The most immediate water quality problem in the region from a heath perspective is pathogenic&#13;
contamination from humans and livestock. Results of bacteriological analyses in the Tuyamuyun reservoir&#13;
as well as aquifers at depths of 30-40 meters and in deeper wells at 300400 meters, show little contamination.&#13;
Nonetheless, the Sanitary Epidemiological Service (Sanepid) found unacceptably high levels of bacteriological&#13;
contamination in shallow wells, surface irrigation canals, and other surface waters in the region that are used&#13;
by rural communities for drinking. In areas with intermittent piped water supplies, similar problems may exist&#13;
because of the infiltration of contaminated shallow ground water.&#13;
10.    Another water quality issue in the project areas is taste. Seasonally fluctuating salinity levels in&#13;
surface waters upstream and downstream of the Tuyamuyun reservoir are a cause of considerable complaint&#13;
by local consumers. Over 68% of households in the survey area complained of the salty taste of their&#13;
principal water supply6.&#13;
5 The capacities of these tanks vary from four buckets for small sized tanks to 2 cubic meters for large&#13;
tanks. No bottled water is used in the area surveyed.&#13;
6 For drinking water, the EU reconumends a maximum allowable concentration 1.5 grams/liter salinity.&#13;
Uzbekistan water quality norms set a maximum allowable concentration of 1.0 grams/liter salinity.&#13;
Concentrations in Tuyamuyun reservoir vary from 0.6-1.6 grams/liter, while downstream in Khorezm and&#13;
Karakalpakstan concentrations in the river and irrigation canals can reach as high as 2.4 grams/liter in the low&#13;
flow period of April. Salinity in the 30-40 meter aquifers near the canals, however, are much less variable in&#13;
the range of 0.7-1.3 grams/liter. Salinity in the deep aquifer varies from 1-3 grams/liter in eastern areas of the&#13;
region and up to 30 grams/liter in the western areas of Karakalpakstan.&#13;
&#13;

PART I: PILOT PROJECT&#13;
Objectives&#13;
11.    The objectives of the assignment are to test on a pilot basis the engineering design, procurement,&#13;
contracting and supervision requirement for water supply and distribution schemes in the region proposed for&#13;
the Uzbekistan: Water Supply, Sanitation and Health project. The lessons gained from this experience will&#13;
be applied to the design and implementation of the full scale project.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
12.    The scope of work will include but not necessarily be limited to the following:&#13;
1.     Review the proposed schemes with community representatives, project design institutes,&#13;
Vodokanal and/or Agrovodolkanal, project feasibility consultant and Goskomprognostat to&#13;
ensure that the least cost and most appropriate technology is being applied, taking into&#13;
consideration future development plans for water supply in the region, as well as water&#13;
resource availability and water quality;&#13;
2.     Review appropriateness of detailed engineering designs, materials, equipment and construction&#13;
standards (GOSTs) being applied, design criteria, equipment specifications, etc. and suggest&#13;
revisions as appropriate. Check and revise cost estimates, draw up material and equipment&#13;
procurement packages;&#13;
3.     Contact community representatives (with the assistance of the Bank's community participation&#13;
specialist) to determine their willingness and ability to finance part of the projects with cash&#13;
and "in-kind" labour contributions. Agree with these groups project financing plans (partial&#13;
contributions to capital and O&amp;M costs according to what they can afford) and project&#13;
implementation, management and operation arrangements (as per attached report in Annex&#13;
HI). In addition determine to what extent the community is able to participate in construction&#13;
activities with either " in kind" labour contribution and/or as paid laborers/contractors;&#13;
4.     Determine the local availability of materials and equipment which meet design specifications&#13;
and separate procurement packages into local and foreign suppliers;&#13;
5.     Contact local importers of foreign materials and equipment, as well as foreign suppliers to&#13;
determine sources which can supply "off the shelf", as the best CIF price. Place orders for&#13;
local and foreign procurement packages and arrange transportation, customs clearance (these&#13;
supplies will be exempt from import duties and other taxes);&#13;
6.     Contact local civil engineering/erection contractors, both public and private, to determine&#13;
which contractors could meet the quality standards required and have the necessary capacity&#13;
for implementation of the pilot projects. Determine if it would be feasible to select local&#13;
contractors under a competitive bidding process. If so, develop bid documents, arrange&#13;
competitive selection process and negotiate contracts with successful bidders;&#13;
7.     Arrange for supervision of pilot projects and evaluate the performance of local contractors&#13;
materials and equipment supplies, etc. Make recommendations for improving performance&#13;
and estimate their capacity for full scale implementation of the project; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
8.     Authorize payments for materials and equipment supplies, shippers, customs agents,&#13;
contractors etc. and keep financial records to a standard which meets the World Bank's&#13;
financial auditing requirements.&#13;
PART II: FULL SCALE PROJECT&#13;
Objectives&#13;
13.    The main objective of the services to be provided under the first phase of this assignment is to prepare&#13;
the detailed engineering designs and procurement packages for goods, works and services to be provided for&#13;
the full scale water supply, sanitation and health project. The second phase of the work will include project&#13;
supervision, negotiating contracts with suppliers and supervision of construction and start up of the project.&#13;
Scope of Services&#13;
14.    A team of International and local specialists ( the Consultant) will be engaged by Goskomprognostat&#13;
for this assignment. The contract will be divided into two phases, which will overlap, but will be funded from&#13;
different sources.&#13;
15.    The first phase of this work to be financed under an initial engineering loan will involve preparation&#13;
of full scale project engineering design and bid documents for equipment and works including: review of the&#13;
GIS database and project management information system that has been developed for the proposed full scale&#13;
project to assess its completeness and recommend improvements; based on feasibility study results firm up all&#13;
design criteria for major project facilities; review all detailed topographic surveys and soil investigations along&#13;
alignments of proposed transmission mains and sites for civil works and identify need for further surveys;&#13;
prepare hydraulic designs of the proposed project facilities; prepare detailed engineering designs and&#13;
construction drawings of the proposed facilities; prepare bill of quantities and divide the procurement of civil&#13;
and erection works and equipment into an appropriate number of contract packages according to the&#13;
requirements and procedures of the donors that will be financing these packages; prepare cost estimates for&#13;
each package; assist the PIU to review tender documents for each contract package; prepare a detailed&#13;
construction management plan for the project; prepare a detailed design report presenting the results of the&#13;
above tasks.&#13;
16.    The second phase of this work, which will not be financed under the engineering loan, but under the&#13;
full scale project will overlap with the detailed engineering design and will be part of the same contract. It&#13;
will involve services to assist the PIU in project supervision and monitoring, as well as contract bidding and&#13;
in supervising construction of facilities proposed under the project.&#13;

            Uzbekistan - Pilot Water Supply Engineering Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Pilot Water
            Supply Engineering Project are to: 1) improve the design and
            implementation arrangements for the full scale project
            through a "learning-by-doing" piloting approach
            and by incorporating community participation into the
            planning and implementation process for water supply and
            distribution; 2) speed up implementation of the full scale
            project through early completion of detailed engineering
            design and preparation of bidding documents; and 3) develop
            and test joint financing and cost recovery schemes to
            improve the financial viability of the Vodokanals and the
            sustainability of their investments. The project consists of
            two components: 1) an investment component to finance a
            pilot project for a community based water supply and
            distribution scheme in Kizketken peri-urban area of Nukus in
            the Republic of Karakalpakstan; and 2) a technical
            assistance component for management and supervision of pilot
            project implementation, and for preparation of tender
            designs and bidding documents for procurement packages for
            the full scale project, followed by preparation of detailed
            engineering designs, project management plans and
            implementation schedules.
