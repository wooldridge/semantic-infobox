STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
L THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR&#13;
Back2round, Water Resources, and Sector Organization&#13;
1.1          Background. Tunisia is a middle-income country located on the southem rim of the&#13;
Mediterranean Sea with a population of approximately 8.8 million that is growing at 1.9 percent a year.&#13;
It occupies an area of 160,000 km2 that has few natural resources. The Atlas Mountains, which run&#13;
from west to east about 280 km south of the northern coastline, separate the country into two distinct&#13;
regions. To the north of the Atlas Mountains is a semi-arid area where the majority of the population&#13;
lives; this is where most of the fresh surface water and arable land is found. The majority of industrial&#13;
and other economic activities are concentrated in the northern coastal areas. To the south of the Atlas&#13;
Mountains is the Sahara Desert, which has scant population, water, and industrial activity. Per capita&#13;
available water resources in the country are 531 m3 a year. The mean annual rainfall is approximately&#13;
0.6 m in the northern region and approximately 0.1 m in the southern region.&#13;
1.2          The Tunisian economy is a captive of both the weather and tourism. Economic growth&#13;
averaged 4.5 percent a year between 1987 and 1994, 2.4 for 1995 and 6.9 projected for 1996. Tunisia&#13;
has experienced three serious draughts in the last twelve years, each causing poor harvest and a&#13;
concurrent drop in domestic consumption. Although there was a 24 percent reduction in agricultural&#13;
output as a result of the 1988 drought, economic growth remained positive largely because of tourism,&#13;
which is being actively developed. Tourism, concentrated in the seaside regions, is a very fragile&#13;
industry that depends on clean beaches and sea water. The Government pays great attention to&#13;
protecting the environment and especially to the proper disposal and treatment of waste water.&#13;
1.3         Water resources.  The annual total volume of exploitable water resources is&#13;
approximately 3 billion m3, consisting of 90 percent (2.7 billion m3) surface water and 10 percent&#13;
groundwater. Sixty percent of these resources have already been tapped, with 20 percent of that&#13;
amount allocated for potable water. By the year 2010, all the available and exploitable water resources&#13;
are projected to be in use, with 25 percent to be allocated for potable water. Water demand for urban&#13;
and agricultural use will exceed available resources, particularly in the southern part of the country, and&#13;
it will gradually become necessary to resort to desalination of brackish water and sea water and to&#13;
reuse treated waste water to supplement the available resources.&#13;
1.4          Sector organization.  In 1975, with the assistance of the World Bank, the&#13;
Government created l'Office National d'Assainissement (ONAS), the national institution in charge of&#13;
sewerage subsector management, including the collection, treatment, and disposal of waste water in&#13;
urban, industrial, and tourism zones. In 1993, its mandate was consolidated under the newly created&#13;
(1991) Ministry of Environment and Land Planning, with increased responsibility for sewage&#13;
operations. ONAS has also expanded into an institution responsible for protection of the hydrological&#13;
environment, working in close cooperation with the National Environmental Protection Agency&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
(ANPE, established in 1989), which is charged with developing and enforcing regulations concerning&#13;
waste water discharge.&#13;
1.5          Responsibility for the water supply systems in urban areas and large rural centers is&#13;
assigned to the Socite Nationale d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux (SONEDE), a national&#13;
water supply authority; it is an autonomous public entity under MoA. Planning, design, and&#13;
supervision of small and medium water supply and irrigation works is the responsibility of the&#13;
Direction Generale du Genie Rural (DGR), an MoA department. MoA's Direction Generale des&#13;
Etudes et Travaux Hydrauliques is responsible for the construction of hill dams and studies and design&#13;
of irrigation infrastructure. Responsibilities for managing investment planning and implementation of&#13;
projects and agriculture activities are with the regional Commissariats Regionauc au Developpement&#13;
Agricole (CRDA). The municipalities are responsible for solid waste collection and storm drainage.&#13;
Water Resource and Sewera2e Sector Strategv&#13;
1.6          Since the 1970s, the country's water resource strategy has given high priority to&#13;
developing water resources to provide drinking water for most of the population, and to irrigate large&#13;
areas of agricultural land. This strategy has also emphasized improved commercial and industrial water&#13;
supplies to accompany economic growth in these sectors. In this context, the sewerage subsector's&#13;
main objective has been to bring sewerage services up to the level of water supply in urban areas. This&#13;
objective has been postponed over time because of budgetary constraints. Currently, ONAS, the main&#13;
provider of sewerage services, is planning to reach a connection rate of 95 percent of the urban&#13;
population served by SONEDE by the year 2011. In the meantime, ONAS has assumed increased&#13;
responsibilities toward safeguarding the environment and controlling pollution by developing a larger&#13;
waste water treatment capacity. The subsector's main outstanding challenges include recycling treated&#13;
water for agricultural and industrial needs and recharging aquifers.&#13;
1.7          The sewerage service has been considered a public service that serves the national&#13;
interest by conserving natural resources and protecting the environment. The targeted financial&#13;
objective of recovering operating and maintenance costs is gradually being realized, although capital&#13;
investments are still largely subsidized. To optimize the use of investments, the existing legislation&#13;
requires all houses and enterprises to connect to the sewer system once it becomes available. To&#13;
minimize public investments and facilitate ONAS' tasks, the Government has been promoting the use of&#13;
individual sewage disposal systems whenever appropriate. This should enable ONAS to concentrate&#13;
on large and more densely populated regions where collective sewage disposal systems are generally&#13;
less costly.&#13;
1.8          The water supply and sewerage sector in Tunisia is now being studied by the Tunisians,&#13;
the Bank, and other donors. The studies cover overall strategy for the sector, including institutional,&#13;
technical, economical, and financial aspects. Under the Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Loan&#13;
3782-TUN), the Government is committed to preparing a comprehensive sector development policy&#13;
letter encompassing both water supply and sewage by December 1998.&#13;
1.9          The proposed project is consistent with both World Bank and MENA strategy for&#13;
managing water resources in that it takes into account both efficiency and social issues, within an&#13;
environmental perspective. The project will also be a catalyst for greater participation by the sewage&#13;
subsector in more comprehensive water resource management planning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
Impact of the Sector on the Environment&#13;
1.10         The environmental aspect plays a central role in the proposed project for two major&#13;
reasons. First, an environmental audit carried out at the sector level, for the first time in Tunisia,&#13;
provided useful insights into Tunisia's well-established sewerage sector, including its linkages to the&#13;
water sector and its relative impact on the environment. This audit highlighted emerging issues and&#13;
how they could be addressed in the context of future investments. Second, the specific assessments&#13;
undertaken for each proposed treatment plant were based on the results of the sector study,&#13;
incorporating the recommendations made into the planning, design, and location of the plants as well as&#13;
the quality and destination of their by-products.&#13;
1.11         The Sector Environmental Assessment (SEA) looked at different sources of pollution&#13;
and their impact on the environment; treatment and discharge standards and how they are currently&#13;
applied, priorities for sanitation, the current policy for recycling treated waste water, the pollution&#13;
caused by industrial discharges, and the related institutional and regulatory aspects. The SEA made&#13;
specific recommendations for each of these aspects and provided guidelines to strengthen institutional&#13;
and environmental management. The most prominent elements of the SEA are described in paras. 1.12&#13;
and 1.14.&#13;
1.12         Main causes of impacts. Although urban sanitation has made significant progress in&#13;
Tunisia, both treated and untreated waste water of urban/domestic and industrial origin still represent a&#13;
major source of pollution, while the run-off of polluted rainwater has a lesser impact. It is estimated&#13;
that 15 to 20 percent of the waste water collected in sewer systems is untreated and discharged in&#13;
receiving water bodies (RWB), with a potential impact on public health. The direct discharge by&#13;
households into lost wells and rainwater drains represents an important pollution load, resulting in&#13;
infiltrations into groundwater resources that could cause irreversible damage. The construction of&#13;
treatment plants and sewer systems remains the most feasible solution, while septic tanks, culverts, and&#13;
ditches connecting to the sewerage network could provide acceptable altematives in low-density areas.&#13;
1.13         Water quality and discharge standards. At the core of the SEA is the concept of&#13;
vulnerability of the RWB. The different types of water bodies were defined and water quality&#13;
objectives were determined to establish their respective level of protection against pollution. A&#13;
classification of all water bodies was established showing their vulnerability to the different sources of&#13;
pollution. Hence, the current discharge standards in use in Tunisia could be adapted to this&#13;
classification in order to reflect the vulnerability criteria. A permanent monitoring program is necessary&#13;
to collect data on actual water quality in order to establish whether it is suitable for the purposes and&#13;
goals set by the water quality objectives. This would provide information to decision-makers on the&#13;
effectiveness of measures taken and where remedial or additional measures are required.&#13;
1.14         Importance of impacts and priority of sanitation. The SEA analyzes the main&#13;
impact of discharges from pollution sources according to the vulnerability class of the RWB, to&#13;
establish the relative importance of each type of impact on a national scale. In general, the most serious&#13;
impacts occur in places where untreated urban and industrial sewage are discharged into Class A&#13;
receiving waters (highest vulnerability). For example, large quantities of nutrients (P and N) contained&#13;
in the effluent will lead to eutrophic conditions (growth of macro-algae) if discharged into the sea,&#13;
causing the deterioration and disappearance of the seagrass beds. As a result of this assessment,&#13;
sanitation priorities have been established, i.e., lists of the first 50 sources of domestic waste water. One&#13;
list indicates priorities for the construction of sewer systems, the other for the sewage treatment. These&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
lists will help decisionmakers to determine the measures needed and prioritize' the allocation of funds&#13;
for investments.&#13;
1.15          It is confirmed that the effective way to reduce pollution requires the design and&#13;
implementation of programs to control and monitor the quality of ground and surface waters. There&#13;
are currently no such programs on a national scale; they should be established based on the&#13;
vulnerability criteria proposed in the SEA. Tunisia has developed a sound overall strategy for&#13;
environmental protection. What is missing is a more detailed elaboration and implementation of this&#13;
strategy via a number of concrete programs (wvith the active participation of the concerned groups) so&#13;
as to effectively address each objective and to enforce regulation and discharge standards. It is also&#13;
necessary to strengthen coordination among the different responsible structures. Finally, it is necessary&#13;
to adapt existing legislation, regulations, and standards to reflect the issues raised and solutions&#13;
proposed in the SEA.&#13;
Reuse of Treated Waste Water&#13;
1.16          In view of the increasing scarcity of ground and surface water resources in Tunisia,&#13;
water recycling could provide an appreciable alternative resource, especially for irrigation and the&#13;
recharge of aquifers, while lessening the negative effects of discharge into the environment. It is&#13;
estimated that by the year 2011, the volume of effluent produced by the 120 operating WWTPs will&#13;
amount to about 266 millions m3 a year, equivalent to 15-20 percent of available ground water&#13;
resources. More than one third of this volume will be produced by the WWTPs of Tunis and another&#13;
third by the WWTPs of Sousse, Sfax, Gabes, Bizerte, and Kairouan, in volumes of 5 to 11 Mm3 a year&#13;
each. Reuse efforts should therefore be made in reuse areas that produce the largest quantities of&#13;
effluent, where there is potential for irrigation (Annex 14) or recharge of the groundwater resources,&#13;
and where RWBs are more vulnerable to pollution, provided that such efforts are economically viable&#13;
(Annex 9). This is important for the sea, most lagoons, the Mejerda River, and the Gulf of Tunis. It is&#13;
worth noting that 75 percent of the WWTPs, producing more than 75 percent of the total amount of&#13;
effluent, are situated along the coast. These estimates show the importance of treated water reuse,&#13;
especially for waste water that discharges into the marine environment and into other water bodies&#13;
vulnerable to eutrophication.&#13;
1.17          The reuse of treated water could undoubtedly bring substantial economic, social and&#13;
environmental benefits. It should, however, be tackled soundly and effectively and be part of the&#13;
national strategy for the mobilization of water resources. This calls for agreement and cooperation with&#13;
the user authorities, namely the ministries of agriculture, industry, and public health, about the&#13;
standards required for each specific purpose for which the effluent is reused. New regulations should&#13;
be established along with revised Tunisian standards to enable reuse for different types of irrigation&#13;
(restrictive or not) and other purposes. Once the standards for effluent quality have been set, it would&#13;
be advisable, for instance, to lower the bacteriological standards for reuse to the level set by WHO, and&#13;
to lessen the restrictions for use in agriculture.&#13;
1.18          Responsibilities for further treatment should be clearly defined between the concerned&#13;
institutions. For instance, disinfection by way of maturation ponds and transport of treated waste&#13;
1/    This prioritization process also depends on other factors, such as the cost of these measures and their&#13;
importance to politicians and the public. This process, however, provides the technical justification for the&#13;
rational management of water resources and protection of the environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
water to the maturation sites could be assigned to ONAS. The MoA could take charge of transport&#13;
from maturation sites to storage sites, and of construction and exploitation of storage basins, irrigation&#13;
infrastructure, infiltration, and distribution to farmers. The issue of cost recovery should also be&#13;
worked out among the institutions involved, as well as with the final users, the farmers. It is equally&#13;
important to educate farmers (and other population groups) about the reuse issue, and to encourage&#13;
them to fully participate in the process.&#13;
1.19         Within the framework of the existing policy for the conservation of water resources,&#13;
the idea of reusing waste water in the scope of the project was greeted favorably by the Tunisian&#13;
Government. Reuse has become, therefore, a fundamental objective of the proposed project, since the&#13;
design of the WWTPs is directly tied to the potential for reuse. The largest potential is in Tunis West,&#13;
where a contiguous irrigation zone of 6,000 ha was identified (see Annex 10, paras. 5.1-5.2). The&#13;
prograrn foresees recycling the effluents of both WWTPs (Tunis-South and West) for irrigation, the&#13;
recharge of aquifers, and other specific purposes. An agreement has been reached between the&#13;
Ministry of Environment and Land Planning and the MoA to establish a detailed outline of the&#13;
recycling program, which will be fully implemented in the proposed project.&#13;
1.20         The means to carry out this program have been defined (paras. 2.4 and 2.6) but will be&#13;
further detailed by appropriate studies. Division of responsibilities among the MoA, the Ministry of&#13;
Environment, ONAS, and the concerned departments have been worked out in such a way that each&#13;
party will be in charge of what is directly related to its activities demonstrating a sound coordination for&#13;
the implementation of every aspect of the program. The studies to be undertaken in the proposed&#13;
project will further determine the responsibilities of each department.&#13;
Industrial Pollution&#13;
1.21         Tunisia has a relatively important industrial base that involves some 10,000&#13;
establishments and represents 30 percent of its GDP. It has favorably contributed to the development&#13;
of the country but its rather anarchic location has created negative impacts on the environment. The&#13;
major industrial poles (representing 90 percent of this activity) are concentrated along the coast,&#13;
causing serious damage to the sensitive ecosystem of the coastal zone. About 1,200 of these industries2&#13;
are considered to be highly polluting. Despite awareness of this constant degradation of the&#13;
environment with all of its extemalities, including the negative impact on tourism, not one industrial&#13;
treatment plant has yet been built. Most industries continue to discharge their waste into the sea, the&#13;
oueds, the sebkhas, and the lakes.&#13;
1.22         Tunisian legislation sets the standards for discharges for three different types of RWNB:&#13;
the sewerage network, the hydraulic network, and the marine environment. Industrial waste waters&#13;
that do not conform to these standards must receive pretreatment before discharge. Industrial operators&#13;
have encountered some technical and financial difficulties in conforming to this legislation, and&#13;
enforcement has been rather difficult. Remedial actions are being taken by the Tunisian authorities, the&#13;
most important ones through FODEP, the industrial depollution fund, which was created in 1992 to&#13;
help the private and public industrial operators finance investments needed for pretreatment. Recently,&#13;
FODEP has helped a number of industries to finance up to 80 percent of the needed investments.&#13;
2/    Only limited quantitative data exist about industrial pollution and discharges; comprehcnsivc work is still&#13;
needed in this area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
1.23        The environmental monitoring function is the responsibility of ANPE, which has been&#13;
instrumental in identifying the increasing number of polluting industries. A recent study conducted&#13;
jointly by the Ministry of Environment and Land Planning and ONAS on two important industrial&#13;
zones, Tunis South (550 establishments) and Sfax (211), has confirmed the low connection rate of&#13;
these establishments. Very few (mainly in the agro-industrial sector) have installed pretreatment&#13;
facilities. Affordable pollution control solutions are being worked out with these establishments. As a&#13;
result of the study, an industrial treatment plant for Tunis South is being planned and will be financed&#13;
by the industrial private entrepreneurs concemed. Replication of this approach is recommended for&#13;
industrial zones throughout the country.&#13;
1.24        Within the scope of this project, the installation of the proposed waste water collection&#13;
systems and treatment facilities will provide an opportunity to reduce further industrial pollution by&#13;
substantially increasing the number of connections. Furthermore, the industries connecting to the&#13;
system will be required to manage their waste water effluents in compliance with the regulations. Non-&#13;
compliant discharges will be identified and will undergo pretreatment, as required by Tunisian law.&#13;
Further, a comprehensive law regarding the discharge, control and management of all waste (solid as&#13;
well as liquid, including industrial waste) has just been passed -- Law No. 96-41, dated June 1996 and&#13;
will be soon followed by the promulgation of a number of decrees. Decrees related to ONAS have&#13;
already been approved.&#13;
Private Sector ParticiDation (PSP)&#13;
1.25        To date, ONAS has had limited interest in the private sector, given its focus on startups&#13;
and the expansion of its mandate. Now that it has a substantial scope of interest, however, it is&#13;
increasingly interested in pursuing additional operational and financial leverage through private sector&#13;
participation (PSD). ONAS' initial objective in this area is to assess the benefits of having private&#13;
sector operators manage its distribution systems and treatment plants, and building and operating&#13;
treatment plants (concessions and BOT schemes). The current USAID program in the sector is&#13;
financing the development of three pilot PSD projects, two of which are underway. These two&#13;
ongoing projects will focus on subcontracting the management of (a) 140 km of urban wastewater&#13;
network in Tunis; and (b) three WWTPs in the tourism-driven Hammamet-Nabeul area. The third pilot&#13;
project being studied concerns a WWTP to be built on a BOT basis and implemented as part of the&#13;
1997-2001 Ninth Plan. The Government is planning to build the Tunis West WWTP (one of the&#13;
largest WWTPs in Tunisia) on a BOT basis, with a private operator being responsible for operation&#13;
and maintenance as well as for financing capital expenditures. All three pilot projects will provide&#13;
valuable lessons for ONAS' existing and expanding operations, as well as a better understanding of&#13;
how to deal with long-term private sector contractors so as to replicate better such arrangements on a&#13;
broader scale throughout the network (Annex 7).&#13;
1.26        The Bank should encourage the above-mentioned projects and the financing of any&#13;
subsequent BOT projects so as to enhance their replication throughout the system.  During&#13;
negotiations, the Government has requested Bank assistance in preparing the Tunis West BOT&#13;
operation. The Bank would assist the Ministry of Environment and ONAS in selecting a consultant&#13;
that would help in preparing BOT bidding documents and negotiations with potential bidders. The&#13;
Project includes a TA component to cover consultant services. The Government will decide later&#13;
whether to use a Bank Guarantee for this operation. The Government agreed to have the Bank&#13;
Guarantee evaluated in the bidding documents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Bank Involvement in the Sector&#13;
1.27         The Bank Group has been extensively involved in the water supply sector since 1968,&#13;
and has assisted in financing eight SONEDE projects (seven loans and a credit). SONEDE was&#13;
established under the first Bank operation in the sector. The first loan of US$15.0 million (Loan 581-&#13;
TUN, January 1969) financed water supply works in the areas of Tunis and Sousse. The International&#13;
Development Association extended a credit of US$10.5 million (Credit 209-TUN, June 1970) to assist&#13;
in improving and expanding water supply works in eight regions of the country.&#13;
1.28         The Bank Group assisted in financing a tourism infrastructure project (Loan 858-TUN&#13;
and Credit 329-TUN, September 28, 1972) that included water supply works valued at US$18.5&#13;
million. The Sidi Salem Multi-purpose Project (Loan 143 1-TUN), which covered the first construction&#13;
phase of the Northem Water Master Plan, was undertaken to meet household and agricultural water&#13;
demand in the northern and central parts of the country. This project was completed in 1984, and since&#13;
then, the quality and quantity of water supply to Greater Tunis have greatly improved.&#13;
1.29         The Bank has also been active in the sewerage subsector and has made three loans for&#13;
sewerage works. The first loan, of US$28.0 million (Loan 1088-TUN, First Urban Sewerage Project,&#13;
February 1975), was for the expansion of sewer systems and construction of a waste water treatment&#13;
plant in Greater Tunis. The second loan, of US$26.5 million (1675-TUN, 1979), financed sewerage&#13;
works in Greater Tunis and Sfax. The third loan, of US$34.0 million (Loan 2255-TUN, June 1983),&#13;
financed sewerage works in 30 cities and towns.&#13;
1.30         The Bank-financed Tourism Infrastructure Project (Loan 858-TUN and Credit 329-&#13;
TUN) also included US$16.6 million for sewerage works. In a closely related area, the Bank made a&#13;
loan of US$25.0 million (Loan 2289-TUN, June 1983) for a flood protection project in Sfax. The most&#13;
recent operation, a Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Loans 3782/3783-TUN) of US$58 million, of&#13;
which US$9 million was for sewerage, was approved on September 21, 1994 and became effective on&#13;
January 21, 1995. This project includes expansion of the water supply production facilities for Greater&#13;
Tunis and a rural water supply component, both for SONEDE, and the construction of three small&#13;
WWTPs for ONAS. The proposed project has been delayed for more than a year because of (a) time&#13;
needed to reflect on strategic issues (sector studies) of the sector; (b) construction of WWTPs that&#13;
were considered a priority (Tozeur, Tataouine, Jammel-Zarmeddine, and other WWTPs) and were&#13;
included in the Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Loans 3782/3782-TUN); and (c) Government&#13;
mobilized grants and loans with soft terms from other donors (Japan, Germany, Europe, etc.).&#13;
1.31         ONAS and SONEDE have performed well under Bank operations, and have&#13;
contributed to major improvements in water supply and sewerage. The percentage of urban population&#13;
connected to the SONEDE system, which was only 43 percent in 1968, has now reached 92 percent.&#13;
For the 1980-95 period, ONAS increased its level of service from 41 percent to 60 percent, with the&#13;
number of communes covered increasing from 35 to 110. Today, SONEDE and ONAS are viable&#13;
public entities managed by experienced and dedicated staff. The completed projects have been&#13;
successfully implemented, as confirmed by OED. In October 1993, EMTIN undertook a review of the&#13;
Bank Group's water supply operations in the MENA region. The review confirmed that SONEDE and&#13;
ONAS have achieved a great deal and are the best performers in MENA's water sector. However,&#13;
more remains to be done to improve the efficiency of their operations and cost recovery.&#13;

IL THE PROJECT'&#13;
The Seweraee Investment Proeram&#13;
2.1          ONAS' yearly activity investment has seen major fluctuations between 1983 and 1989,&#13;
with amounts varying from TD 16 million to TD 20 million. The slowdown from 1986 onward&#13;
corresponded to austerity measures taken during the structural adjustment program. Investments began&#13;
to increase substantially in 1990, with TD 32 million, and have continued to increase steadily, reaching&#13;
TD 61 million by 1996.&#13;
2.2          The Government's objectives for the sewerage investment program are: (a) expansion&#13;
of the existing ONAS network to provide 95 percent of the population with sewerage services by the&#13;
year 2011, compared to 77 percent in 1995; (b) rehabilitation and maintenance of existing networks&#13;
and equipment; and (c) construction of new WWTPs to treat additional waste water, which are&#13;
projected to reach about 500,000 m3/d by 2011.&#13;
2.3          To reach this objective, the Government will have to invest about TD 1.2 billion, an&#13;
amount that neither the Government nor ONAS can likely afford in view of other priorities and&#13;
budgetary constraints. TD 400 million will be invested by the end of the Ninth Development Plan&#13;
(1997-2001), and the balance will be invested between 2001 and 2011. Three-quarters of the Ninth&#13;
Development Plan (i.e., TD 300 million) consists of the Fourth Urban Sewerage Project, which covers&#13;
the four largest urban cities of Tunisia (Tunis, Sfax, Sousse, and Kairouan). The proposed project&#13;
covers all of the Greater Tunis program except for the Tunis West WWTP, which would be financed&#13;
by the private sector (BOT).&#13;
2.4          The Tunis West WWTP of the activated sludge type, will have a capacity to treat the&#13;
sewage of 850,000 population equivalent. The main complex will be situated at El Attar, near the&#13;
Momag basin. A sewage collection center, with preliminary treatment facilities consisting of sand and&#13;
grit removal, and a pumping station, will be situated at a lower site on the shore of Lake Sedjoumi. A&#13;
7.5 km, 0.6 m 0 double-pressure main will transport the sewage from the collection center to the&#13;
WWTP. The treated waste water will be conveyed via a pumping station and a pressure main to the&#13;
Mornaguia basin, where it will be used for irrigation or discharged into a tributary of the oued Meliane.&#13;
Project Obiectives&#13;
2.5          The proposed project will assist the Government in: (a) improving service levels of&#13;
urban sewerage up to the average level of potable water service; (b) promoting efficient reuse of&#13;
effluent from sewage treatment plants for agricultural purposes; (c) reducing urban and coastal&#13;
pollution; (d) improving ONAS' cost recovery and financial capacity, with the long-term objective of&#13;
making it more autonomous and self-financing; (e) introducing appropriate new sewage treatment&#13;
technology; (f) providing technical assistance to develop private sector participation in the sewerage&#13;
sector; and (g) acquiring environmental monitoring and management equipment and tools, and studies.&#13;
Proiect Descriition&#13;
2.6         The proposed project, which is detailed in Annex 2, includes an urban sewerage&#13;
component for ONAS and an agriculture component for MoA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
The urban sewerage component for ONAS includes:&#13;
(a)   extension and rehabilitation of the Tunis South (Meliane) WWTP in the southern basin&#13;
of Tunis. The capacity will be increased from 300,000 to 675,000 population&#13;
equivalent, applying the same extended aeration treatment procedure;&#13;
(b)   restructuring of the western Tunis sewage collection system to divert part of the&#13;
sewage to the new Tunis West WWTP. This restructuring will require the construction&#13;
of 52 km of primary sewers;&#13;
(c)   strengthening of the Southern Tunis sewage collection system and the connection of&#13;
the villages of Mornag and Rades to the Southern Tunis WWTP, requiring the&#13;
construction of 48 km of sewers;&#13;
(d)   extension of the Northern Tunis sewage collection system by 33 km and construction&#13;
of a liaison conduit of 4 km between the Northern Tunis and Choutrana WWTPs,&#13;
replacing an open canal that obstructs groundwater drainage of the Soukra plain into&#13;
Lake Ariana;&#13;
(e)   extension, rehabilitation and resizing of the sewage collection networks of Central and&#13;
Northern Tunis (La Goulette and Le Kram), to prevent salty groundwater intrusion.&#13;
This will require construction of 45 km of sewers;&#13;
(f)   strengthening of all secondary sewer systems, requiring 230 km of sewers;&#13;
(g)   construction of pumping stations;&#13;
(h)   acquisition of miscellaneous sewer maintenance and management equipment; and&#13;
(i)   technical assistance, studies, and research work.&#13;
The reuse of treated sewage in the agriculture component for MoA includes:&#13;
(j)   the construction of a multi-seasonal storage basin with a capacity of one to two million&#13;
m3, in the El Attar valley, at about 4 km distance from the Tunis West WWTP, where&#13;
treated waste water will be stored to be used for irrigation. The Bank should agree on&#13;
the selected consultants, the design criteria, and the related studies (feasibility,&#13;
environmental impact assessment and final design). The generic safety measures that&#13;
will be designed will be reviewed by the Bank, including the appointment of an&#13;
independent panel of experts;&#13;
(k)   the equipment of an area of 1,000 ha in the El Attar area, to be irrigated with treated&#13;
sewage. This area can be expanded to 6,000 ha as more treated waste water becomes&#13;
available in the governorates of Ariana and Ben Arous; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
(1)       carrying  out of a pilot project for groundwater recharge with  appropriately  tertiary&#13;
treated purified sewage. The depleted aquifer will be recharged to form a barrier&#13;
against sea water intrusion.&#13;
Detailed studies related to (i), (j), and (k) (feasibility, environmental impact assessment&#13;
and final designs) will be carried out during 1998 and 1999. Agreement has been&#13;
reached to carry out the detailed studies acceptable to the Bank by December 31, 1998&#13;
for the feasibility study and environmental impact assessment and by December 31,&#13;
1999 for final designs. (para. 5.1 (i)).&#13;
Project Cost Estimates&#13;
2.7                  Project cost estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  2.1  below.  Total project cost is&#13;
estimated at TD 119.7 million (US$106.7 million), with a direct and indirect foreign exchange&#13;
component of TD 68.0 million (US$60.6 million). Identifiable taxes and duties amount to about&#13;
9.7 percent of total cost. More detailed cost estimates are given in Annex 3.&#13;

March 1997 levels. Physical contingencies have been estimated at 15 percent. Price contingencies have&#13;
been calculated based on a projected local inflation of 3.5 percent a year and a foreign inflation of 2.3&#13;
percent a year. Cost estimates for the reuse component are based on a preliminary study.&#13;

2.9          Two Bank loans of an aggregate amount of FRF 340 million (US$60 million&#13;
equivalent) will be made available: one to ONAS of FRF 283 million (US$50 million equivalent), with&#13;
a Government Guarantee for the sewerage sector; and one to the Republic of Tunisia for FRF 57&#13;
million (US$10 million equivalent) for the agriculture component. The two loans will be in single&#13;
currency (FRF) with a fixed rate up to 15 years, including three years of grace, with an expected&#13;
disbursement period of six years. The FEPS review meeting recommended a direct loan to ONAS&#13;
taking into account its technical and financial achievements. This issue was discussed during appraisal&#13;
with Government and ONAS, but the final decision was made later and confirmed during negotiations.&#13;
ONAS' financial situation and creditworthiness was assessed during appraisal. A direct loan to ONAS&#13;
with Government guarantee is fully justified.&#13;
International Cooveration&#13;
2.10         Technical assistance. ONAS has benefited since its creation from bilateral technical&#13;
and financial assistance from several countries (including Germany, the United States of America, the&#13;
Netherlands, Belgium, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Japan, France, and Sweden). The technical assistance&#13;
has covered different aspects of ONAS activities and dealt specifically with providing equipment,&#13;
training of technical staff, holding seminars in Tunisia and abroad, and implementing specific projects.&#13;
The German cooperation has been the most active. Germany has had experts working with ONAS for&#13;
the last 20 years. Their mission has evolved over time (training in the fields of hydraulics, sanitation,&#13;
civil engineering, maintenance and supervision of works).  The present program for German&#13;
cooperation is to set up and organize the industrial pollution department of ONAS, provide equipment&#13;
for WWTP laboratories, create regional laboratories, and help develop a national strategy for solid&#13;
waste. Japan has financed the feasibility and environmental studies for the Fourth Urban Sewerage&#13;
Project, which includes Greater Tunis, Sfax, Sousse, Kairouan, and Nefza and represents 60 percent of&#13;
the Ninth Development Plan (1997-200 1).&#13;
2.11         Financial cooperation.  The sewerage sector has attracted many institutions,&#13;
especially during the last ten years. Loans outstanding as of December 31, 1996 from international&#13;
financial institutions amount to TD 56 million, from KfW, Germany (TD 16 million), the European&#13;
Investment Bank (TD 12.8 million), the World Bank (TD 11.6 million), and the Kuwait Fund&#13;
(TD 7.7 million). These four institutions represent 86 percent of the loans' balance. This investment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
program regarding the Ninth Development Plan will be implemented in the years 1997-2001 (about&#13;
TD 400 million). Agreements have been or are in the process of being reached between the Tunisian&#13;
Government and intemational fuinding agencies to cofinance a substantial part of the program:&#13;
IBRD(US$60 million for the proposed Greater Tunis Sewerage and Reuse Project), KfW&#13;
(DM 28 million for the Bizerte area), Nordic Banks (US$11 million equivalent for Tataouine and&#13;
Jammel-ZarTneddine), OECF, Japan (Yen 8,518 billion for Sfax, Kebili, Douz, and Zriba), and the&#13;
Islamic Development Bank (US$15 million equivalent for Kairouan).&#13;
Procurement and Contract Review&#13;
2.12         All contracts financed by the Bank will be procured in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines for Procurement.&#13;
(a)   For part A of the proiect: Contracts for civil works and pipe laying, larger than&#13;
US$3 million equivalent per contract and US$50 million in the aggregate, and&#13;
contracts for pipe supply larger than US$1 million equivalent per contract and&#13;
US$20 million in the aggregate; and contracts for equipment supply, with or&#13;
without installation, larger than US$500,000 equivalent per contract and US$7&#13;
million in the aggregate will be procured through international competitive bidding&#13;
(ICB). Contracts estimated to be smaller than these ceilings, for which little&#13;
international interest is expected, may be procured using national competitive&#13;
bidding procedures (NCB), in which foreign firms may participate. Bidders for the&#13;
construction of the Tunis South (Meliane) WWTP under paragraph 2.6 (a) will be&#13;
prequalified.&#13;
(b)   For Dart B of the project: Contracts for civil works and pipe laying larger than&#13;
US$3 million equivalent per contract and US$10 million in the aggregate, and&#13;
contracts for pipe supply larger than US$700,000 equivalent per contract and&#13;
US$5 million in the aggregate; and contracts for equipment supply, with or&#13;
without installation, larger than US$500,000 equivalent per contract and US$2&#13;
million in the aggregate will be procured through ICB. Contracts estimated to be&#13;
smaller than these ceilings, for which little international interest is expected, may&#13;
be procured using NCB, in which foreign firms may participate.&#13;
(c)   For both parts of the project, contracts for the supply of goods procured through&#13;
ICB, a margin of preference of 15 percent or the actual customs duty, whichever is&#13;
less, would be allowed for domestic goods. The relatively high individual and&#13;
aggregate ceilings for the use of national procurement methods is justified by an&#13;
efficient local contracting business and a well developed network of local dealers&#13;
representing foreign companies. Consultants would be retained in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's Guidelines for the use of consultants. Annex 13 gives a detailed&#13;
breakdown of the procurement method and contract review (para. 5. 1 (a)).&#13;
2.13         Assurances were obtained during negotiations that NCB procedures related to this&#13;
project will be satisfactory to the Bank (para. 5. 1(a)). A list of contracts, including their estimated value&#13;
and the procurement method, is attached in Annex 13. The following table indicates the procurement&#13;
method for Bank-financed contracts for this project.&#13;

The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2004. The closing date of the loan will be&#13;
December 31, 2004 to allow sufficient time to release retention funds.&#13;
Special Account (SA)&#13;
2.17         To facilitate implementation of Part B of the project, agreement was reached to&#13;
establish an SA for the loan to the Republic of Tunisia at the Tunisian Central Bank, on terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Authorized allocations to the SA have been agreed upon at&#13;
FRF 6,000,000. The authorized allocation will be limited to FRF 3,000,000 until the aggregate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
withdrawals from the loan account reach FRF 12,000,000. The SA will be replenished on a monthly&#13;
basis or when at least one third of the balance has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier.&#13;
Documentation requirements for replenishment applications will follow the procedure described in&#13;
para. 2.16 above. In addition, monthly bank statements of the SA reconciled by the Borrower will&#13;
accompany all replenishment requests.&#13;
Audits, Accountinz. and Insurance&#13;
2.18         Previous project agreements among ONAS, MoA, and the Bank provided for the audit&#13;
of financial statements (ONAS accounts, project accounts, etc.) by independent auditors. Assurances&#13;
were obtained during negotiations that financial statements will be audited by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied, and&#13;
that the audit reports will be submitted to the Bank within seven and six months. respectively, by&#13;
ONAS and the MoA after the close of each fiscal year. Separate audit reports will be issued for the&#13;
project accounts and the SOE (para. 5.1 (b) . During negotiations, the Bank agreed also to accept the&#13;
Government auditors to audit the MoA project account and the SA. The Government auditors in&#13;
Tunisia are competent and have done similar work satisfactorily.&#13;
2.19         ONAS does not have a complete and adequate cost accounting system, and there is no&#13;
reliable information regarding costs of storm-water drainage, industry, or tourism. Agreement was&#13;
reached that no later than December 31. 2000, ONAS will have a reliable cost accounting svstem in&#13;
place (para. 5.1(g)).&#13;
2.20         ONAS carries insurance covering the usual risks of public utility organizations. The&#13;
policies include workman's compensation and third-party liability coverage on its operations.&#13;
Project Implementation and Monitoring&#13;
2.21         The Project Implementation Schedule in Annex  11 shows the timing and&#13;
implementation phases of each component. ONAS and MoA will be responsible for implementing the&#13;
sewerage and the reuse parts of the project, respectively. They will be assisted by consultants&#13;
whenever necessary. During project execution, appropriate indicators will be used for ONAS and&#13;
MoA. Annex 6 includes the monitoring indicators. Furthermore, assurances were obtained that:&#13;
(a)   the Government and ONAS will report semi-annually to the Bank on progress in&#13;
implementing the project components and on the evolution of the monitoring indicators&#13;
(para. 5.1(c));&#13;
(b)   the Government and ONAS shall carry out a midterm review by December 31, 2001 to&#13;
evaluate project implementation (para. 5.1(i)); and that the Government and ONAS&#13;
will take any reasonable remedial action, after discussion with the Bank, that might&#13;
become necessary for: (i) proper execution of the project, (ii) efficient management of&#13;
both components, or (iii) achieving the targets set for ONAS and MoA perfornance&#13;
indicators;&#13;
2.22         Within six months following the closing date of the loan, ONAS and the MoA will&#13;
prepare and submit to the Bank a completion report on the execution and initial operation of all project&#13;
components, the project's costs and benefits, and the realization of its objectives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
2.23         Project Supervision. Taking into account the nature of the project, particularly&#13;
regarding institution building and technical assistance, tight supervision will be required. Supervision&#13;
missions will be carried out at least twice a year, preferably in conjunction with the supervision of the&#13;
earlier Water and Sewerage Project (Loans 3782/3783-TUN). A detailed supervision plan is attached&#13;
in Annex 12.&#13;
IIL FINANCIL ANALYSIS&#13;
3.1          ONAS receives revenues from both direct and indirect consumer charges. Sewerage&#13;
tariffs, assessed on the basis of water consumption, and fixed contributions for the construction and&#13;
maintenance of sewers, are charged directly to users and invoiced quarterly. Contributions from&#13;
municipalities for construction and maintenance of storm water drainage systems are indirect charges,&#13;
passed on to users through property taxes. At present, such revenues do not cover ONAS' operating&#13;
and depreciation costs. The shortage is made up by Government contributions. ONAS allocates a&#13;
portion of these Government funds to its operating costs and uses the remainder as equity contributions&#13;
toward the financing of its investment program. ONAS completes the financing of its investment&#13;
program with borrowing.&#13;
Past and Current Financial Performance of ONAS&#13;
3.2          ONAS' income statements, cash flow statements, and balance sheets for the years 1982&#13;
through 2006 are shown in Annex 8. Up to and including 1994, ONAS was unable to meet its&#13;
financial covenants under the previous Bank-financed projects, especially the 13 percent of its annual&#13;
average of capital expenditures, with its own internal sources (Loan 2255-TUN). Its operating ratio&#13;
increased from 80 percent in 1985 to 96 percent in 1995. The deterioration of financial performance&#13;
prior to 1991 was due to rapidly rising operating costs and the deferral of tariff adjustments. However,&#13;
the tariff increases of 15 percent a year since 1992 have had a positive impact on ONAS' financial&#13;
situation. Furthermore, 1995 closed with a net surplus of US$2.6 million and a debt-to-equity ratio of&#13;
14:86. Throughout the entire period, the debt service coverage ratio always exceeded 1.34. The&#13;
future financial performance is expected to be positive.&#13;
3.3          ONAS' cost recovery policy is aimed at preserving its short and long-term financial&#13;
viability while ensuring affordable service for its less affluent household customers; and at creating&#13;
incentives, through progressive tariffs for industries and other large consumers, to minimize the&#13;
discharge of waste water (Annex 5). ONAS' revenues are expected to continue to cover a substantial&#13;
part of its operating expenses and debt service, as well as a portion of its investment costs. In 1995,&#13;
ONAS' income from tariffs covered about 80 percent of its operating and maintenance costs,&#13;
compared to 46 percent in 1989, a significant improvement.&#13;
3.4          Substantial tariff increases have led to an average increase in revenues of 17 percent a&#13;
year since 1992. However, ONAS still relies heavily on Government subsidies to finance part of its&#13;
operations and its entire investment program. Total remittances from the Government (local and&#13;
central) increased from TD 12.2 million in 1982 to TD 61.3 million in 1993, with an aggregate amount&#13;
of TD 412.8 million for the 1978-1993 period.&#13;

Future Financial Performance of ONAS&#13;
3.5          Financial projections and their underlying assumptions related to balance sheet, income&#13;
statement, and Government subsidies appear in Annex 8. Three basic annual tariff increase scenarios&#13;
have been used to prepare the financial projections until the year 2006: 8 percent, 10 percent, and 15&#13;
percent. Three objectives have been pursued in the analysis of the three scenarios:&#13;
(a)    Cost recovery of operation and maintenance. The break-even point is reached&#13;
when ONAS can generate sufficient revenues to fully cover its total operational costs&#13;
and the Government ceases to contribute to these costs. This point occurs in the year&#13;
1999 with a 15 percent yearly increase, in 2001 at 10 percent a year, and at 2004 at&#13;
8 percent a year;&#13;
(b)    Cost recovery of capital investments. The level of Governnent subsidies depends on&#13;
the annual tariff increases. With increases of 15 percent a year, the Government would&#13;
subsidize investments until the year 2001; at 10 percent a year, until 2004; and at 8&#13;
percent, until 2006; and&#13;
(c)    Cash equilibrium.  This objective aims at measuring cash generated through the&#13;
different tariff scenarios. The 8 percent scenario shows a positive cash situation of TD&#13;
1 million by the year 2006; the 10 percent shows TD 4 million by that year; the 15&#13;
percent shows a cash balance of TD 16 million. The cash balance at the end of 1995&#13;
was TD 10 million.&#13;
3.6           All three scenarios would enable ONAS to become financially self-sufficient in the long&#13;
term. The 15 percent annual tariff increase that has been in effect since 1992 (and would be difficult to&#13;
sustain over a long period) would be sufficient to cover 100 percent of ONAS' operations and&#13;
investments by the year 2001. The lowest case scenario, 8 percent, would give the same results only&#13;
by the year 2006, while the 10 percent annual tariff increase would make ONAS fully self-sufficient by&#13;
the year 2004.&#13;
3.7          In addition to tariff increases, ONAS will have to modify its tariff structure during&#13;
implementation of the project to address the equity issue and the distortions used by the current&#13;
progressive tariff system. The Contrat Programme (CP) between the Govemment and ONAS has&#13;
been prepared for the Ninth Development Plan (Annex 15). The CP addresses all issues related to&#13;
tariffs, financial and operational performance. The CP would be the basis for Bank conditionalities.&#13;
A2reement has been reached on the following:&#13;
3.8          The CP has been approved by the Boards of Directors of ONAS. Approval of the CP&#13;
by the Government and execution of it on behalf of both the Govemment and ONAS is a condition of&#13;
effectiveness. Three conditionalities are specifically stated in the Loan Agreement with ONAS (para.&#13;
5.1):&#13;
(a)    ONAS will increase its sewerage tariffs by at least 8 percent a year (4.5 percent in real&#13;
terms) for each fiscal year until project funds are fully disbursed. Tariffs conceming&#13;
1996 have been increased by 15 percent (10.5 percent in real terms), effective April 1,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
1996, in line with Government's commitment for the Eighth Development Plan (1992-&#13;
96) (para. 5.1 (d));&#13;
(b)    The progressive block tariff system will be restructured to eliminate regressiveness of&#13;
the tariff for the first block and to limit the benefits of cross subsidy to the poor&#13;
identified in the first tranches of consumers, by no later than December 31, 2002&#13;
(para. 5.1(e)); and&#13;
(c)    The financial covenants of the ongoing Water Supply and Sewerage project (Loan&#13;
3782-TUN) are reinstated; i.e., ONAS will have at least 1.3 times its projected debt&#13;
service in each fiscal year on all of its debt, including debt to be incurred, and its&#13;
internal cash generation to cover capital expenditures during each fiscal year will not be&#13;
less than 30 percent of the investment required (para. 5.1(f)). Furthermore, before&#13;
November 30 of each fiscal year, ONAS will, on the basis of forecasts satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank, review whether it will meet such requirements, and if so, it will take all&#13;
necessary measures to meet such requirements.&#13;
IV. SOCIOECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
4.1          Sanitation, until recently, was considered a public service. The State, mainly through&#13;
ONAS, provided for the service by covering the majority of capital expenses. Expansion of the service&#13;
in the future will have to consider more closely the consumers' willingness and ability to pay for&#13;
increasing costs, as well as the opportunity costs of the resources committed to the service. To this&#13;
end, as part of project preparation, ONAS and a team of consultants carried out an economic study to&#13;
identify scenarios for rationalizing the activity, optimizing supply to demand, and integrating the&#13;
efficiency issue and the equity concern into program planning.&#13;
Demand Analysis&#13;
4.2          During the 1982-94 period, the number of ONAS customers increased at an average&#13;
rate of 9.8 percent a year, while consumption grew by 4.7 percent a year. Total revenues from&#13;
sewerage charges increased during this period by 17 percent a year in nominal terms (10 percent a year&#13;
in real terms). This substantial increase in total revenues is the outcome of the following factors:&#13;
(a) extension of the network to new customers, (b) increase in the connection rate, (c) the progressive&#13;
block structure and the important average tariff increases per volume over the last few years, and&#13;
(d) the increase in consumption per customer for the highest consumption category. These factors&#13;
were offset partially by: (a) a decrease in average consumption per connection, in particular for the&#13;
industrial (-13 percent a year) and tourism sectors (-10 percent a year); (b) the concentration of&#13;
customers in the lowest consumption bracket; and (c) the loss of customers in the highest consumption&#13;
bracket.&#13;
4.3          Projections for demand for aggregate and individual uses through 2029 are given in&#13;
Annex 9. The elasticity of demand has been calculated on the basis of an econometric model using&#13;
quarterly statistics for the 1983/I through 1993/IV period. The main results are that: (a) globally,&#13;
ONAS customers are sensitive to price adjustments (elasticity is set at 0.5 for all sewerage uses&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
combined), which explains the reduction in average consumption per customer; (b) the reaction of&#13;
customers consuming more than 70 m3 per trimester to the marginal tariff is particularly important, as&#13;
this group could largely reduce its consumption or disconnect; (c) customers are more sensitive to&#13;
average tariffs than to marginal ones; and (d) industrial users, in particular, are very sensitive to price&#13;
adjustments, as observed in para. 4.2. The policy of cross-subsidization (see para. 4.10) among&#13;
categories and consumption brackets could reach a limit if tariff adjustments induce large consumers to&#13;
decrease their consumption.&#13;
Long-Run Avera2e Incremental Costs&#13;
4.4          To evaluate the extent to which current tariff policy provides incentives to invest&#13;
optimally in additional system capacity and use current and future capacity more efficiently, or to define&#13;
the level of services for which consumers are willing to pay, the long-run average incremental costs&#13;
(LRAIC) for the 1983-2000 period were estimated (see Annex 9). In the case of ONAS, efficiency&#13;
should be interpreted to mean that the additional costs that ONAS bears in order to provide additional&#13;
sewerage services should be equal to the utility accruing to the consumer for that additional service, the&#13;
additional service being measured in additional units of waste water collected.&#13;
4.5          Estimates were carried out for collection, transport, and treatment services as a whole&#13;
and for each service separately. Investment projections were based on the following assumptions:&#13;
(a) the connection rate by the year 2011 will reach 95 percent of the population in SONEDE's service&#13;
area; (b) the estimated average demand growth rate for the ONAS population will be 5 percent a year&#13;
for the 1994-2011 period, decreasing to 3 percent a year between 2011-2021 and then to 2 percent a&#13;
year during the 2021-29 period3; (c) an additional treatment capacity of 500,000 m3/day will be&#13;
installed, resulting in a treatment rate of 75 percent and a capacity utilization rate of 89 percent. The&#13;
main results of the retrospective and prospective analyses indicate that past and future LRAICs are&#13;
higher than current tariffs, with a 1995 average tariff equivalent to approximately 30 percent of the&#13;
LRAIC. The tourism sector and the most polluting industries pay tariffs that cover, respectively,&#13;
62 percent and 50 percent of LRAICs (see tables 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 in Annex 9).&#13;
4.6          The observed gap between average tariffs and LRAIC  would suggest that&#13;
decisionmakers have incentives to install excess capacity as compared to a system that encourages&#13;
efficient allocation. It also suggests that the targeted objectives of the investment program do not take&#13;
fully into account the consumers' willingness to pay and their sensitivity to price adjustments, which&#13;
would be needed to sustain such an investment program.&#13;
4.7          The unused capacity observed in some of the country's WWTPs, excluding those in the&#13;
Tunis area, indicates that ONAS could make better use of its existing productive capacity. A better&#13;
cost recovery of LRAIC could be obtained, even under the current tariff structure, through higher&#13;
connection rates, which would optimnize the use of existing infrastructure.  This will require a&#13;
coordinated effort to: (a) motivate polluting industries to pretreat and to hook up to the sewerage&#13;
system, and (b) reduce the impact of seasonal demand (tourism) on estimated capacity needs. Waste&#13;
water treatment accounts for 30 percent of total LRAIC and provides treated water, which still has a&#13;
3/    A 5 percent average rate of growth of consumption reflects a 3 percent increase in the demand for potable&#13;
water (consistent with projections done for SONEDE) plus a 2 percent increase that captures an improved&#13;
connection rate for ONAS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
very limited market but very high potential in a country with scarce water resources. Until now, no&#13;
treatment cost has been recovered from the use of 20 percent of treated water for irrigation.&#13;
4.8           The proposed tariff increases will enable ONAS to cover around 50 percent of the&#13;
estimated LRAIC by the year 2003. Cost recovery will be higher, however, if treated water can be&#13;
reclaimed more extensively and priced to cover treatment costs.&#13;
Tariff Structure and Subsidies&#13;
4.9           The tariff policy for ONAS was designed and evolved with the objective of recovering&#13;
operating costs and adapting tariffs to the purchasing power of its customers. This policy has enabled&#13;
ONAS to cover, since 1995, about 80 percent of its operating costs, excluding stonn water-related&#13;
expenses. However, ONAS does not yet recover the investment costs or the opportunity cost of the&#13;
capital that the Government has transferred to the utility.&#13;
4.10          ONAS, like SONEDE, has been using a progressive block tariff structure, with the first&#13;
block (0-20 m3 per quarter) designed for the poorest group. In the 1989-1994 period, the tariff&#13;
adjustments for the first two blocks were minor, while adjustments for the last two blocks have been&#13;
substantial, and have doubled for the tourism sector. The comparison between the average tariff paid&#13;
by household customers who are in the first block and those who consume more than the first block&#13;
reveals that these tariffs are not as progressive as the marginal tariffs. Furthermore, efforts to create a&#13;
progressive tariff scheme are hindered by the regressive nature of the fixed charge. The variable tariff&#13;
of 6 millimes per cubic meter for the first block becomes 136 mnilimes considering the fixed charge,&#13;
which is double the tariff paid by the second block. For other categories, tariffs increase but at a&#13;
relatively low rate: the average tariff for the fourth block is not even double that for the first block.&#13;
4.11          In 1993 the total subsidy transferred from the Government to consumers, through&#13;
ONAS, amounted to TD 9 million, excluding the opportunity cost of capital. If we consider the&#13;
opportunity cost of capital, however, the subsidy amounts to TD 31 million4 (see Table 4.5, Annex 9).&#13;
These subsidies are regressive in relation to different categories of users. In 1993, for example, the&#13;
subsidy was equivalent to TD 6.4 per connection for consumers belonging to the first block and TD&#13;
190 per connection for consumers belonging to the fourth block. Industry (with the exception of low-&#13;
polluting industry) and the tourism sector are not subsidized, if we exclude the opportunity cost of&#13;
capital. However, the measure of the subsidy in relation to the average cost hides the fact that costs&#13;
associated with the transport and treatment of industrial and tourism waste water are generally higher&#13;
than for domestic consumers. The current accounting system does not allow a direct link to be&#13;
established between the cost of investment and the cost of service provided per category of&#13;
consumption.&#13;
4/     The total subsidy is calculated comparing the average cost of the activity to the average tariff paid by&#13;
consumers. The opportunity cost of capital is estimated at 8 percent which is equal to 4 percent average&#13;
borrowing costs for ONAS during 1983-93 plus 4 percent exchange losses due to depreciation of the&#13;
dinar.&#13;
&#13;

Economic Analysis of the Greater Tunis Proiect&#13;
4.12         Least-cost solution. The feasibility studies carried out under project preparation, and&#13;
the environmental assessment done for each physical component, have jointly identified the most&#13;
techno-economically feasible altemative that satisfies quality discharge standards. Tunisian standards&#13;
are basically the same for effluents discharged into the sea, fresh water, and the municipal&#13;
network, as well as effluents intended to be reused in agriculture5. The comparison among&#13;
technological alternatives was not therefore influenced by the final use of the effluent. Between&#13;
the two sites identified as possible areas for the construction of the Tunis West WWTP, the first&#13;
one on the shore of Lake Sedjoumi was eventually disregarded for numerous reasons that were&#13;
technical and environmental: (a) complexity of the foundations on the sandy land surrounding the&#13;
lake; (b) environmental vulnerability of the lake (as suggested in the EIA); and (c) proximity to&#13;
the urbanized area, with a projected inclusion of the site in the urban area in ten years' time. The&#13;
economic comparison among the feasible alternatives was then carried out for the second site at&#13;
El Attar. Such a site was offering perspectives for treated water reuse in agriculture. The&#13;
opportunity for recycling for agricultural use, and the environmental vulnerability of potential WWTP&#13;
sites, strongly influenced the selection of the site for the Tunis West WWTP. The altematives showed&#13;
no major differences in investment cost.&#13;
4.13         Project benefits. Major benefits will derive from the project, including: (a) reduced&#13;
health hazards and improved well-being of the currently unconnected population through better&#13;
sewerage services and treatment of waste water; (b) provision of capacity to meet future demand,&#13;
(c) improved environmental conditions through expansion of waste water treatment capacity and&#13;
rehabilitation of existing infrastructure; and (d) implementation of a waste water recycling program in&#13;
agriculture.&#13;
4.14         The project will provide a total of 30,000 new connections and will finance the primary&#13;
and secondary mains to accompany the urban development of Tunis, where the population will increase&#13;
from 1.7 million in 1994 to 2.5 million by 2011. To meet the need for additional treatment capacity&#13;
(see para. 4.2 above), a new WWTP in Tunis West will be built and the WWTP in Sud Meliane will be&#13;
expanded, yielding additional waste water treatment capacity of 150,000 m3/d. Part of the treated&#13;
water is expected to irrigate approximately 6,000 ha of contiguous land. However, the first tranche of&#13;
irrigated perimeter will be limited to 1,000 ha.&#13;
4.15         Economic rate of return (ERR). The benefits of the project can be measured by the&#13;
satisfaction that consumers derive from the additional sanitation services, which they would not derive&#13;
in the absence of the project. The insatisfaction is measured by their willingness to pay (WTP). This&#13;
concept refers to the price that consumers are willing to pay for one additional cubic meter of water&#13;
collected and treated in different situations, with and without the project. In theory, given the demand&#13;
curve of a consumer, consumer satisfaction can be measured as the surface under the curve. The net&#13;
benefit for the consumer will be such a value, discounted by the costs bome by society to produce the&#13;
service demanded -- in this case, the quantity of water collected and treated.&#13;
5!    Effluent standards for discharge into the sea, fresh water, and the municipal network are in fact slightly&#13;
more stringent (NT 106.002, 1989).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
4.16         In practice, the demand for sanitation is nonseparable from that for potable water. The&#13;
satisfaction from the provision of sanitation, therefore, had to be estimated indirectly, as the difference&#13;
between the satisfaction only from water supply services and from joint water supply and sanitation&#13;
services (see Annex 9). It is very difficult, because of limited data, to isolate the impact of the&#13;
introduction of the sanitation service on the consumer demand curve. Three separate scenarios were&#13;
therefore generated: (a) the consumption of water does not change (hyp. 1); (b) consumption increases&#13;
by 3 percent a year (hyp. 2); and (c) consumption decreases by 3 percent a year (hyp. 3). The WTP&#13;
was then calculated for each category of consumer, by calendar year, under these scenarios, using the&#13;
demand curves (for both water and water-sanitation) estimated with the same methodology as in para.&#13;
4.5.&#13;
4.17         The total costs of the Greater Tunis project have been estimated in constant 1996&#13;
prices, including physical contingencies but excluding taxes and custom duties. The construction&#13;
period is expected to be 1998-2005, and the effects of the project are expected to begin one year after&#13;
the start of construction. The direct foreign component is estimated at 60 percent of total project&#13;
costs, and will be converted into dinars at the official exchange rate. The investment costs were&#13;
separated into imported goods, labor, and nontradables, and were converted into economic prices&#13;
through conversion factors respectively valued at 1.2, 0.8, and 0.9. Since Tunisia's trade policy was&#13;
recently liberalized through the easing of quantitative restrictions and the lowering of custom duties,&#13;
the gap between border prices and domestic prices for imported goods consists mainly of the customs&#13;
duty, averaging approximately 20 percent. Regarding labor costs, the labor force employed by ONAS&#13;
belongs to the structured sector, which is subject to labor legislation with respect to the minimum&#13;
wage. Although productivity has strengthened substantially in recent years, the minimum wage is still&#13;
higher than the shadow wage for unskilled labor. Operating costs were transformed into economic&#13;
costs by averaging the conversion factors for investments.&#13;
4.18         The net benefit of the project was then obtained by estimating the benefit per customer&#13;
as the difference between the satisfaction provided by having access only to water and to water and&#13;
sanitation. The benefit per cubic meter was calculated as total satisfaction divided by the average&#13;
consumption per customer per category. The total benefit of the project was then obtained by&#13;
multiplying the benefit per cubic meter for the additional quantity of water collected and treated as a&#13;
result of the project. With these assumptions, the ERR was estimated at 28 percent, 24 percent, or&#13;
33 percent, according to the scenario being considered. Under any of these three scenarios, the project&#13;
is fully justified.&#13;
4.19         Positive environmental externalities, which may influence consumer satisfaction, are&#13;
partially caught in the consumer surplus estimations. Other important benefits, such as those accruing&#13;
from the treated water recycling program in agriculture, have been only partially quantified (Annex 9).&#13;
4.20         Sensitivity tests were carried out on a set of pertinent variables, as shown in Table 4.9&#13;
in Annex 9. The tests indicate that the ERR is more sensitive to variations in consumer income and&#13;
consumption. These two variables influence the consumer utility and willingness to pay. On the basis&#13;
of these results, the ERR will rise as real income rises and as more small consumers are connected to&#13;
the network, since their utility will be higher. Even in the case in which pessimistic scenarios were&#13;
considered, the ERR remained satisfactory. The ERR is not very sensitive to changes of up to&#13;
20 percent in the shadow exchange rate or to variations of the same magnitude in the other conversion&#13;
factors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
4.21         Sousse investment program  - economic justification.  During the Ninth Plan,&#13;
ONAS intends to proceed more aggressively with the privatization program by calling the private&#13;
sector to participate in the construction and management of the Sousse Nord's new WWTP. The&#13;
World Bank is ready to give its full assistance to make such a program successful. For this reason, an&#13;
economic evaluation of the prospective Sousse investment was carried out. The ERR results, as&#13;
described more in detail in Annex 9, tables 4.10-4.11, indicate that the investment is filly justified.&#13;
4.22         An assessment of the irrigation scheme component has shown, as reported in Annex 9,&#13;
that the investment costs, including treatment, of reusing treated water in agriculture are lower than the&#13;
economic cost of producing and bringing fresh water to the farm gate. This justifies the introduction of&#13;
the pilot component in the project. The evaluation of the economic viability of the irrigation scheme&#13;
depends on the different cultivations developed in the perimeter and their international prices. In the&#13;
case of cereals, a low value-added culture, the ERR ranges around 6 to 8 percent. The feasibility&#13;
study for the reuse component, which is a condition of loan disbursement for that component,&#13;
should include farm budget analysis to reduce the risk that farmers will not want to use treated&#13;
waste water. Appropriate institutional arrangements for setting up a costrecovery scheme of the&#13;
reuse component should be explored.&#13;
Poverty Alleviation and Affordability&#13;
4.23         According to the 1990 Household Consumption Survey carried out by Tunisia's&#13;
National Institute of Statistics, 7 percent of the population had annual per capita expenditures below&#13;
the poverty line (defined as TD 196 per person), and another 7 percent had per annual capita&#13;
expenditures only 25 percent above the poverty line. Poverty in Tunisia is essentially a rural&#13;
phenomenon; approximately two thirds of the Tunisian poor live in rural areas. In urban areas poverty&#13;
seems to be associated mainly with the lack of human capital qualifications; the provision of basic&#13;
infrastructure for the whole population, however, does not seem to exclude the poor, particularly in&#13;
Tunis. The extension of basic services to low-income areas, as in the case of the proposed project, will&#13;
affect the well-being of the urban poor6, although they might represent a small portion of the new&#13;
connections. The project will most likely provide a large proportion of service to people living just&#13;
above the poverty line.&#13;
4.24         As discussed in para 4.10, the first block (0-20 m3 per quarter) was designed for the&#13;
poor. More than 40 percent of ONAS customers are in that block, which suggests that targeting the&#13;
poor through the block structure is a difficult task. Moreover, the current tariff structure is regressive&#13;
compared with the first block, which pays a total tariff (including variable and fixed components)&#13;
double that of the second block. Regressive tariffs should be eliminated through future adjustments to&#13;
reduce the impact on the budget share of water sanitation expenditures for the lowest consumption&#13;
expenditure group, estimated to be 3.5 percent in 1990.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
4.25         The project has been reviewed, screened, and proposed for Category A, consistent&#13;
with the provisions of Operational Directive 4.01, Annex E, "Environmental Assessment." Preparation&#13;
for this project was comprehensive, encompassing a Sector Environmental Assessment (SEA) and&#13;
6/    There are an estimated 60,000 urban poor in the biggest Tunisian towns. Greater Tunis may account for&#13;
one third of the urban poor.&#13;
&#13;

Project Specific Assessment (PSA) for each of the WWTPs proposed for the Greater Tunis area.&#13;
These ONAS assessments were based on studies, field work, and public consultation with the different&#13;
concerned population groups and with the many institutions involved. In addition, ONAS is required&#13;
by law to undertake an Environmental Impact Assessment in conformity with the requirements of&#13;
ANPE.&#13;
4.26         These assessments showed that numerous positive impacts will arise from this project,&#13;
ranging from those related to public health to those directly affecting the economy. Such effects are&#13;
generally associated with the provision of sewage treatment facilities to a sizable part of a capital city,&#13;
with coverage of more than a million inhabitants equivalent; an increase of 30,000 connections to the&#13;
sewer network; and protection of vulnerable receiving waters from polluting discharges. Other&#13;
substantial benefits concem the agriculture sector, since the proposed project will include the reuse of&#13;
treated waste water for irrigation and other purposes related to the protection and preservation of&#13;
groundwater resources.&#13;
4.27         Few negative impacts associated with the project have been studied. These are related&#13;
to the construction and operation of the treatment facilities and rehabilitation of the sewerage system.&#13;
The environmental analysis is presented in detail in Annex 10, along with a plan to mitigate the&#13;
identified negative impacts. These mitigation measures will be made part of the environmental&#13;
strengthening and educational program to be developed within the scope of this project. The project&#13;
will not cause any resettlement due to construction of proposed facilities.&#13;
4.28         Public Consultation. In view of the assigned category and the importance of this&#13;
project in the Greater Tunis area at the economic, social, and environmental levels, the consultation&#13;
process took place at an early stage of project preparation. It encompassed several institutions and&#13;
population groups concerned with the project, including various NGOs, farmer groups and&#13;
associations, governmental and professional institutions. In addition, a one day seminar was held under&#13;
the auspices of the Minister of Environment. The seminar attracted a large audience to whom the&#13;
project in its different aspects and components, including the reuse of treated water, was presented and&#13;
discussed. Valuable comments and recommendations were received. The latter, examined and&#13;
supported by the Bank mission, were incorporated during appraisal into the final project. The public&#13;
consultation results are presented in Annex 10.&#13;
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
5.1          During negotiations, agreements were reached with the Government and ONAS on the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a)   Procurement of goods and works shall be carried out in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
guidelines and procedures, and the employment of consultants shall be in accordance&#13;

REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA&#13;
GREATER TUNIS SEVVERAGE AND REUSE PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
ONAS Organization&#13;
Background&#13;
1.          ONAS, the national sewerage authority, was established in 1974 to manage the&#13;
sewerage sector; its responsibilities, include wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal in urban&#13;
agglomerations and industrial and touristic zones. In 1993, its mandate was consolidated under the&#13;
newly created Ministry of Environment and Land Planning (1991) with increased responsibility for&#13;
sewerage operations. ONAS has the status of an industrial and commercial public company with&#13;
financial autonomy. It has been the beneficiary of Bank Group lending in the sector, channeled&#13;
through the Government (Loans 1088-, 1675-, 2255-, and 3782-TUN).&#13;
Organiation and Management&#13;
2.          The current organizational structure of ONAS is shown in page 4 of this annex.&#13;
The 15-member Board of Directors, presided over by ONAS' General Manager, supervises the&#13;
company's activities. Nine Board members are public officials representing Ministries and other&#13;
agencies involved in the water and sewerage sector. The remaining six Board members represent&#13;
municipalities and ONAS customers. The Government's overall control over ONAS, aside from&#13;
the appointment of its Board members, comprises approval of ONAS's investment programs,&#13;
procurement exceeding DT 1 mnillion, borrowing, and tariff levels.&#13;
3.          Daily operations of ONAS are handled by its five regional departments (Greater&#13;
Tunis, North East, North West, Center, and South) and four central departments (development,&#13;
coordination and organization, finance, and administration). Six other service units, including&#13;
internal audit and budget control, report directly to the General Manager.&#13;
4.          Under previous Bank loans, ONAS used consultants to coordinate the planning and&#13;
design of its work program, and to develop and set up a project planning and control system. It&#13;
now has in place a good financial accounting system and effective managerial and financial&#13;
reporting procedures. However, it has no reliable cost accounting system that gives a detailed&#13;
account of distinct activities such as storm drainage, industry, and tourism. ONAS is presently&#13;
working with consultants to develop such a cost accounting scheme, which will be in place by&#13;
1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
Staff and Training&#13;
5.          At the end of 1994, ONAS had 2,872 permanent staff, equivalent to 5.08&#13;
employees per thousand house connections. This ratio is acceptable for ONAS' decentralized type&#13;
of operations, but staff productivity should be increased and the number of employees per thousand&#13;
connections should be reduced. ONAS' salary structure and benefits are adequate to recruit and&#13;
retain qualified personnel.&#13;
6.          A comprehensive training strategy has been developed by the Staff Training&#13;
Division of ONAS (Conmmission de la formation et du perfectionnement professionnel) with the&#13;
assistance of the Republic of Germany (GTZ) and EU training experts. So far, twelve hundred&#13;
staff have participated in short-term training seminars covering different aspect of ONAS&#13;
operations, including nineteen engineers who received grants for overseas training in sanitary&#13;
engineering and other fields related to sewerage operations. Plant operators have also received&#13;
training by the equipment manufacturers responsible for operating of plants the first year after&#13;
construction. ONAS has also trained the staff in budget planning and cost accounting.&#13;
MiIIing and Collection&#13;
7.          Sewerage charges are based on water consumption. SONEDE is responsible for&#13;
billing and collection, and is generally efficient, although in the past, there were delays in&#13;
transferring the payments to ONAS. Recently, this situation has greatly improved. Now SONEDE&#13;
generally transfers the payments within one month.&#13;
8.          ONAS operates a commercial accounting system based on the Tunisian General&#13;
Accounting Plan. All transactions are recorded properly, allowing identification of expenditures by&#13;
major cost categories. General accounts, inventory control, and payroll are computerized and up-&#13;
to-date. The main problem is related to cost accounting, recording followup, and inventory of&#13;
fixed assets. ONAS is also developing, with outside assistance, a proper plant register for the&#13;
entire system, which will enable ONAS to efficiently manage its assets and operational costs.&#13;
9.          ONAS operations are monitored by a Technical Controller and a Financial&#13;
Controller, appointed by the Government, who are advisory members of the Board of Directors. In&#13;
addition, the agency's financial statements are audited each year by independent private auditors&#13;
acceptable to the World Bank, in keeping with the audit covenant (Water Supply and Sewerage&#13;
Project, Loan 3782-TUN). The covenant requires that the certified audit report be furnished to the&#13;
Bank as soon as available, but not later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year. This&#13;
covenant will be restated in the project agreement for the proposed loan.&#13;
10.         ONAS carries adequate insurance with different Tunisian insurance companies to&#13;
cover the risks commonly faced by a public utility. The policies relate to motor vehicles&#13;
operations, fire damage to buildings, and third party liability. ONAS is self-insured for workmen's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;

compensation, maintaining a special insurance fund for this purpose. All supply and civil works&#13;
contracts for the project will be insured by private companies against loss and damage in shipment,&#13;
accidents, and fire and property damage.&#13;
11.         The main operational achievernents of ONAS as of December 31, 1995, were:&#13;
- Number of commnunes taken in the ONAS system # 100&#13;
- Connection rate for communes in the ONAS system: 76.8 percent&#13;
- Connection rate, all communes: 60%&#13;
- Population served: 4.3 million&#13;
- Number of connections ONAS-SONEDE: 600,000&#13;
- Infrastructure in place:&#13;
- Network: 6,700 km&#13;
- Pumping stations: 274&#13;
- WWTP: 48&#13;
- Volume of wastewater collected: 135 million cubic meters&#13;
- Volume of wastewater treated: 117 million cubic meters.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA&#13;
GREATER TUNIS SEWERAGE AND REUSE PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
Detailed Proiect Description&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.          Tunis, the capital of the Republic of Tunisia, is a rapidly growing city; its&#13;
population grew from 186,000 in 1926 to 685,000 in 1966 to 1,778,000 in 1996. Growth is&#13;
expected to continue at 2.9 percent per year until the year 2000 and at 2.2 percent per year&#13;
thereafter. Consequently, the population is expected to reach 2 million by the year 2000 and 2.54&#13;
million in the year 2011. The city has quite an effective infrastructure and provides all modem&#13;
services, including water supply, a telephone network, and electricity to most of its inhabitants.&#13;
Sewerage is slightly behind, however; only about 60 percent of the urban population is connected&#13;
to the sewerage system. The Government created the National Sewerage Authority, ONAS, in&#13;
1974, with a mandate to provide adequate sewer services to the growing population. Over the last&#13;
20 years, ONAS has done an excellent job in fulfilling this mandate, but because of its relatively&#13;
capital intensive investments, remains somewhat behind in service level compared with the water&#13;
supply authority, SONEDE. The Government is planning important investments in this subsector,&#13;
with the objective of attaining a service level of 95 percent by the year 2011. The proposed&#13;
project is part of this effort.&#13;
Design Criteria&#13;
2.          The project is part of the sewerage master plan for Greater Tunis for the year&#13;
2011, which in tum is based on the urban master plan for the same year. The target population of&#13;
2.54 million is distributed evenly throughout the service area, in conformity with the urban&#13;
development plan. Water consumption is estimated to increase at a rate of 0.5 percent a year&#13;
based on SONEDE statistics. Consumption is categorized by type of housing. Tourist areas are&#13;
estimated to consume 680 liters per occupied bed. The sewage flow is rated to be 80 percent of&#13;
the consumed volume of potable water. The biological oxygen demand (BOD) load is estimated&#13;
to increase from 37 mg BOD per capita per day in 1996 to 42 mg BOD per day in 2010.&#13;
Industrial flow is estimated to remain unchanged, at 20 m3 per ha per day per existing or newly&#13;
developed industrial area, with a BOD load of 400 mg per liter.&#13;
PROPOSED PROJECT ELEMENTS FOR ONAS&#13;
3.          To minimize pumping costs and limit the time raw sewage remains in the sewers,&#13;
sewers normally follow the natural drainage pattem of each area. For this reason, Greater Tunis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-                              ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
is subdivided into four drainage basins: the Central Basin. the most important one, covering&#13;
central Tunis; the Southern Basin, covering the southern part of Tunis, comprising the&#13;
industrial area of Ben Arous and the suburbs of Rades, Hammam-Iif, and Mornag; the&#13;
Northern Basin covering the northern suburbs Ariana, Choutrana, and Soukra, and the coastal&#13;
zone from La Goulette to La Marsa and Gammarth; and the Western Basin, covering the&#13;
expansion area of Tunis towards the west, including Manouba and Bardo (see attached&#13;
Maps IBRD 27729 and IBRD 27730).  The sewerage infrastructure proposed  to be&#13;
constructed by ONAS in the framework of this project is described per sub-basin in the&#13;
following paragraphs. Some miscellaneous project elements are described in para. 13 and the&#13;
Agricultural elements are described in para. 14. More information is available in the&#13;
feasibility study documents, available in the World Bank's project file.&#13;
The Central Basin&#13;
4.          This basin, covering the old city, has a relatively well-functioning sewer&#13;
system. Most of the system is of the separate type, except in the Medina, where combined&#13;
sewers evacuate sewage as well as storm water. The sewer system is well-maintained, except&#13;
for the portion in Medina, which is in a bad state of repair and needs to be rehabilitated. This&#13;
project includes replacement of about 8,125 m of sewers with sewers of a larger diameter, and&#13;
the construction of 1,650 m of culverts.&#13;
5.          The sewage from this basin is treated in two sewage treatment plants (STEPs)&#13;
at Cherguia and Choutrana. The latter one is now being expanded under EIB financing. The&#13;
combined capacity of the two STEPs is sufficient to cover demand until the year 2010. The&#13;
project will divert part of the Westem Basin's sewage, which is now treated in these STEPs,&#13;
to the new Tunis West STEP, thus reducing their present load.&#13;
The Southem Basin&#13;
6.          This basin covers the southem part of Tunis, comprising the industrial areas of&#13;
Ben Arous and Megrine and the suburbs of Rades, Hammam-Lif, and Momag. The works for&#13;
this basin will cover normal projected expansion, the suppression of industrial discharges in&#13;
southem Tunis Lake, and the connection of the villages of Momag and Rades to the Tunis&#13;
sewerage system. The projected work includes construction of 9,500 m of primary sewers&#13;
with diameters of 250 mm to 1200 mm; 4,500 m of culverts with dimensions varying from&#13;
2.5x0.8 m to 4xI.4 m; and one pumping station with a capacity of 2 m3/s against a head of 4&#13;
meters. Two storm water basins, with capacities of 30,000m3 and 35,000 m3, will be&#13;
constructed under another project, for which financing is still being sought.&#13;
7.          The treatment capacity for this basin needs to be increased from the present&#13;
15,000 kg BOD/day to 30,000 kg BOD/day, or expressed differently, from 300,000 to&#13;
675,000 population equivalent. The present STEP of Sud-Meliane is of the extended aeration&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;

type, with carousel aerators. The original design foresaw expansion using two identical units.&#13;
The feasibility study for the proposed project confirmed this option as the most economic&#13;
solution. In addition to this, the treatment plant needs some major rehabilitation.&#13;
The Northern Basin&#13;
8.         This basin covers the northern suburbs of Ariana, Choutrana, and Soukra, and&#13;
the coastal zone from La Goulette to La Marsa and Gammarth. The proposed works for this&#13;
basin cover normal expansion to meet the demand of the growing population. In addition,&#13;
many old sewers in the La Goulette - La Marsa area need to be rehabilitated. The sewers are&#13;
of the vitrified clay type with cemented joints, and are often situated below the groundwater&#13;
table. These joints are seldom watertight, and the groundwater, which is salty in this area,&#13;
infiltrates in the sewers. This results in increased salinity of the raw sewage and hence of the&#13;
effluent of the sewage treatment plant, rendering it less usable for irrigation. The proposed&#13;
works for this basin amount to the construction of 32,550 m of main sewers and the&#13;
rehabilitation of 35,000 m of secondary sewers.&#13;
9.         The sewage of this basin is treated in the "Cotiere Nord" treatment plant,&#13;
which is of the aerated lagoon type and has sufficient capacity for the foreseeable future. The&#13;
effluent is transported through an open canal along the shore of Ariana Lake to the Choutrana&#13;
treatment plant, where it is mixed with the effluent of that plant and used for irrigation. This&#13;
canal forms a hydraulic barrier to the normal drainage pattem of the Soukra plain, resulting in&#13;
an elevation of the groundwater table and inundation of low areas and basements. To solve&#13;
this problem, the open canal will be replaced by a closed conduit of about 4 km, which will&#13;
have no negative influence on the groundwater flow.&#13;
The Western Basin&#13;
10.        This basin covers the expansion area of Tunis, south of the road to Mateur and&#13;
west of lake Sedjoumi, including Bardo, Manouba and Oued Ellil. Most of the works&#13;
included in the project are for this basin. Part of the basin is already urbanized and connected&#13;
to the sewer system. The sewage is pumped over the divide into the Central Tunis basin and&#13;
then treated in the Chergia and Choutrana treatment plants. Because of the long detention&#13;
time in the sewers and the relatively high temperature in Tunis, the sewage becomes septic,&#13;
causing odor problems and promoting crown corrosion of the pipes. The sewer system will&#13;
therefore be restructured, with sewage being diverted to the new treatment plant that will be&#13;
constructed for this basin. In addition to the restructuring of the present sewer system, new&#13;
sewers will be constructed for new areas where future urbanization is planned to take place.&#13;
The works proposed for the Western Basin comprise the construction of 52.5 km of primary&#13;
sewers with diameters of 400 mm to 1200 mm, and the construction of 230 km of secondary&#13;
sewers with diameters of 250 mm to 350 mm. The sewage flow will be directed to a low point&#13;
of the basin on the shore of Lake Sedjoumi.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
11.         A new waste water treatment plant, not included in the World Bank project,&#13;
will be constructed as a BOT operation, during the same construction period of 1998-2004.&#13;
Two sites were considered for the construction of the new sewage treatment plant, the first&#13;
one at the lowest point of the basin, on the shore of Lake Sedjoumi, and the second one&#13;
7.5 km to the west of this site, at Attar, just after the divide with Oued Chefrou and Oued&#13;
Meliane basin. The second site was given preference, since the first one will be in the center&#13;
of the urbanized area within ten years. Furthermore, the second site brings the treatment plant&#13;
nearer to the plain of Momagia, where effluent from the treatment plant will be used for&#13;
irrigation. The sewage will be treated in two stages - a preliminary treatment consisting of&#13;
screening and grease and grit removal at the site on Lake Sedjoumi, to make the sewage&#13;
suitable to be pumped to the second site. A pumping station with a final capacity of 2.6&#13;
m3/sec will pump the sewage through two steel pressure mains with a diameter of 1400 mm,&#13;
over a distance of 7.5 km and against a head of 110 m (95 m static), to the treatment plant at&#13;
Attar.&#13;
12.         The Attar treatment plant will have a capacity of 34,000 kg BOD/day (or&#13;
850,000 population equivalent) and use an activated sludge process after primary&#13;
sedimentation. Gas from the digested sludge will be recovered rendering the treatment plant&#13;
self-sufficient in its energy requirements. The sludge, after treatment and drying, will be made&#13;
available as a soil conditioner for agriculture. The treated effluent, after maturation, will be&#13;
conveyed through a pumping station and a 15 km pressure main to Sidi Fraj in the nearby&#13;
plain of Momagia, to be used for restricted irrigation (fruit trees, fodder and cereals). During&#13;
periods in which no irrigation water is needed, the effluent will be discharged in a tributary of&#13;
the Oued Meliane.&#13;
13.        In addition to the works described above, the project will include several other&#13;
elements:&#13;
(a)   the construction of secondary sewers in the four basins with a total length of&#13;
230 km. Tertiary sewers are normally included in Tunisia's urban development&#13;
projects and financed by the urban developer,&#13;
(b)   the acquisition of miscellaneous sewer maintenance and management&#13;
equipment, and&#13;
(c)   consultant services for miscellaneous studies and works supervision, the&#13;
updating of the sewerage master plans for several cities, and the preparation of&#13;
the bidding documents and provision of legal and financial services related to&#13;
the BOT for the Tunis West WWTP.&#13;

PROPOSED PROJECT COMPONENTS FOR THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE&#13;
14.        In order to efficiently implement the reuse aspects of the project, the Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture has agreed to participate in the project and implement the following project&#13;
components:&#13;
(a)  the construction of a multi-seasonal storage basin of about 1 to 2 million m3&#13;
volume in the Oued El Attar valley, in order to make treated sewage available&#13;
to local farmers for selected crops. The detention time of several months in this&#13;
basin will improve the water quality and have a beneficial impact on the&#13;
groundwater level, availability and quality; and avoid discharge of sewage&#13;
(albeit treated) in the oued Medjerda;&#13;
(b)  the equipment of 1000 ha in the El Attar area with an overhead irrigation&#13;
system, to be used for irrigation with treated sewage from the El Attar WWTP.&#13;
The equipment will include a pumping station, 3 overhead reservoirs, access&#13;
roads, windbreaks and water supply and irrigation systems. These 1000 ha are&#13;
part of the 6000 ha available, the remaining 5000 ha will be equipped at a later&#13;
stage when more treated waste water becomes available; and&#13;
(c)  the realization of a pilot project to experiment with the use of treated sewage,&#13;
after tertiary treatment, for aquifer recharge. A recently constructed sewage&#13;
treatment plant in the Cap Bon area, near Soliman, seems the most appropriate&#13;
site. The expected benefits include the formation of a hydraulic barrier against&#13;
sea water intrusion, and the availability of ground water for non-restricted&#13;
irrigation.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
Role of the Private Sector&#13;
THE PROJECT&#13;
1.    ONAS does currently anticipate private sector participation (PSP) in the Tunis West WWTP&#13;
of the Greater Tunis program. This however, portends favorably for eventual PSP because it&#13;
enhances and expands the scale of operations for the Greater Tunis area, making it a more attractive&#13;
target market for future PSP.&#13;
2.    ONAS is assessing PSP on a traditionally-prudent Tunisian basis involving a gradualistic&#13;
approach with pilot projects in the area of sub-contracting distribution system management and&#13;
processing management (see subsequent section), whose results will then be analyzed and which&#13;
will then formn the eventual basis for operational policy. This displays prudent planning that focuses&#13;
on the two principal operational areas within ONAS and minimizes miscalculations in future policy&#13;
making; the process, however, is more lethargic than it needs to be, with even the Ministry of&#13;
Economic Development having expressed a desire to ONAS for more expedient implementation in&#13;
the pursuit of savings by the Government. To parallel such a sentiment, the Bank has again&#13;
emphasized the availability of funding for additional PSP projects.&#13;
CURRENT PSP DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
3.    USAID has a $30 mm program in place for environmental projects, which is available in&#13;
three tranches of $10 mm. Each tranche is available sequentially subject to performance criteria&#13;
being satisfied. The first tranche is being utilized to finance feasibility studies in the area of&#13;
privatization of waste-water operations. ONAS has accepted certain recommendations and has&#13;
accepted two pilot projects involving the sub-contracting of (a) 143 kmn of urban waste-water&#13;
networks in northern Tunis (a contract has been awarded to a foreign operator, and works start in&#13;
January 1997), and (b) three water treatment plants built in the 1980-83 period in the Nabeul-&#13;
Hammamet region which is tourist -and agriculturally-oriented. USAID conservatively anticipates&#13;
cost savings of 20% p.a. over the three-year term. ONAS will look either to apply internally what&#13;
they will learn from the private operators and/or look to expand the sub-contracting program&#13;
throughout ONAS.&#13;
4.    In 1996, ONAS launched a request for proposals for the refurbising and operation of the&#13;
three treatment plants referred to in paragraph 3 above. The original budgeted amount for this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52-&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
project was US$1 mm, which will now require up to $1 mm in supplemental supplier financing&#13;
from the prospective respondents. ONAS is considering launching two BOT-type projects in Tunis-&#13;
West and Sousse-Nord, whose parameters have not yet been determined. The Bank has also&#13;
emphasized that funds will be available to facilitate such projects.&#13;
PSP OUTLOOK&#13;
5.    The potential for parallel PSP is substantial, especially in the area of sub-contracting.&#13;
ONAS' payroll of approx. 3,400 is substantial for a country of 8 mm and 60% urbanization. The&#13;
potential for successful PSP is substantially limited by a series of revenue and operating cost&#13;
constraints which have been imposed on ONAS. These are discussed below.&#13;
Revenue Factors&#13;
6.    The principal area for revenues is recycling, where ONAS experiences a limited penetration&#13;
rate of 20% (yielding little revenue) versus a treatment penetration rate of 50%. This should be&#13;
substantially higher given the contiguity of agricultural, industrial, and tourism industries to the&#13;
ONAS network, and the current average cost of fresh water of TD 0.35/ cubic meter, which would&#13;
be the Government's avoided cost to buying recycled water.&#13;
7.    The agricultural market would be an ideal candidate, as it consists primarily of cereals and&#13;
olive and citrus orchards. It is limited, however, by the artificially-priced fresh water which is sold&#13;
to farmers at approximately 60 millimes/m3, well below the LRAIC. Clearly, the farmer has little&#13;
incentive to purchase recycled water, especially given the stigma that it currently carries in Tunisia.&#13;
However, the Ministry of Agriculture who also controls SONEDE has, to date, shown some&#13;
interest in extending its support to a coordinated strategy that would allow ONAS to optimize its&#13;
own network and use its treated waste water in irrigation. A specific component is included in the&#13;
project, the details of which have to be studied during project implementation.&#13;
8.    The industrial sector would also be an ideal market, given that is a source of waste water&#13;
and is not as demanding with regards to the quality of its water feed. Additionally, the costs of&#13;
infrastructure and servicing such a client are substantially higher, as the industrial client requires&#13;
high volumes and continuous attention, which ONAS acknowledges. A recycling strategy making&#13;
the larger industries self-sufficient would help ONAS avoid these capacity costs so as to reduce the&#13;
differentials between tariffs and LRAIC. This market is, however, limited by ONAS's grid which&#13;
is not exhaustive in the industrial areas. Again, another ministry is involved. Grid consolidation&#13;
and expansion opporunities in these areas should be explored.&#13;
9.    The tourist sector is also attractive, especially with the emphasis that the Government has&#13;
placed on golf. Golf courses can be designed to be self-sufficient and to also utilize recycled water.&#13;
The golf course in La Soukra (in northem Tunis) has such a system in place. This potential is&#13;
limited, however, by the liberty given to each development to establish its own wells, which are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;

often tapped for free during periods of low rainfall. As the tourist areas of Hammamet and Sousse&#13;
are the principal areas with such activity, the negative externalities in terms of groundwater cost for&#13;
the contiguous agricultural and human needs must also be considered. ONAS reports that there is&#13;
little to no inter-ministerial support, which would be needed to overcome the above constraints.&#13;
The Bank should focus on overcoming such resistance.&#13;
Cost Constraints&#13;
10.   The prospective private operator would also face the following cost constraints, thus&#13;
limiting the degree of private involvement. Below are some of the principal constraints.&#13;
(a)   Debt Costs. The capital-intensive nature of the business and the long economic life of the&#13;
capital assets requires the access to long-term capital in domestic markets. The Tunisian&#13;
bank market is currently unequipped to provide such capital, which limits the purchasing&#13;
power of the Tunisian private sector and, if it were feasible with short-term debt, it would&#13;
require an uneconomically high tariff structure to service debt amortization. The Bank must&#13;
emphasize the crucial importance of an infrastructure funding vehicle for future PSP.&#13;
Absent such a funding venue, the solution would be to have the public sector retain the&#13;
capital assets, with their operation and management being in private hands.  The&#13;
govenmment's current costs of capital approximate Libor + 70 b.p.'s (most recent Euro-&#13;
loan issue (1/26/96)), which would be very hard for any Tunisian or foreign private firm to&#13;
compete with.&#13;
(b)   Production Costs. Waste-water treatment is, by its very nature, a joint or commnon activity&#13;
with other economic activities. ONAS, however, is structured and treated as a stand-alone&#13;
entity dependent entirely on a government tariff for its revenues and unable to commingle&#13;
its operating costs with other activities to enjoy common- or joint-costing structures. A&#13;
private operator would be expected to assume such a cost structure. Greater emphasis must&#13;
be placed on the co-production of waste-water treatment, especially where there are&#13;
thermally-intensive processes (such as power generation, chemical recovery, or refining&#13;
processes) and the possibility for industrial self-sufficiency.  Again, inter-ministerial&#13;
cooperation is an essential means to achieving such ends.&#13;
(c)   Equit Capacity. ONAS is currendy not allowed to invest jointly in water-treatment&#13;
projects, which is also a disincentive to any private investor who would consider ONAS's&#13;
experience in the sector and would not invest more than a 50%, for balance sheet reporting&#13;
purposes, toward any investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 7&#13;

SUMMARY&#13;
11.   ONAS has great potential eventually to become a management/concessionary company&#13;
which could, over time, (i) sub-contract out substantial operational and managerial services to the&#13;
Tunisian private sector, (ii) invest in joint ventures with other private or public sector ventures, or&#13;
(iii) possibly lease certain fixed assets over the long term. The means to achieving these ends,&#13;
include the debottlenecking of certain structural constraints, so that the pilot projects result may&#13;
enjoy a broader field for implementation.&#13;
12.   The Bank has re-emphasized the availability of funds for the BOT project. In the medium-&#13;
term, the Bank must pursue the development of an infrastructure financing market and the enhanced&#13;
co-operation between ministries as well as an expanded network role for ONAS. As indicated in&#13;
the economic analysis ONAS cannot expect its cost-oriented stand-alone nature to be entirely&#13;
covered by tariffs alone at least for the short term.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
ONAS: Assumutions of ONAS' Financial Performance and Projections&#13;
Assessment of Current Tariff Policy&#13;
1.           Over recent years, average charges (both fixed and variable) have increased rapidly.&#13;
The annual rate of increase from 1989 to 1995 averaged about 17%, marking a very significant change&#13;
in ONAS's tariff policy. This has resulted in a definite improvement in the coverage of collection,&#13;
transportation and waste water treatment costs by user fees. In fact, although average charges to all&#13;
categories of users previously covered only about 46% of average operating costs, this figure had risen&#13;
to 80% by 1995. The degree of tariff adjustment has been considerable, with an average increase of&#13;
about 8-10% in real terms, depending on whether the basis for calculation is the cost of sanitation or&#13;
the users' purchasing power.&#13;
2 .          Nevertheless, the cost recovery problem has not yet been solved, particularly if one&#13;
considers the opportunity cost of the capital that the Government has transferred to ONAS.&#13;
Obviously, this opportunity cost must be factored into cost calculations, which must not be based on&#13;
funding, because this allows cost entries to be reduced artificially by increasing financing from&#13;
government sources, thus reducing the share of debt financing.&#13;
3 .          The cost of capital used for the purposes of the study is 8%, consisting of a 4%&#13;
average interest rate paid by ONAS from 1989 to 1993, and a 4% exchange loss caused by the fall in&#13;
the value of the dinar resulting from the difference in inflation between Tunisia and the lending&#13;
countries. If this estimated total average cost is factored in, it too shows an improvement in the rate of&#13;
cost recovery from charges, although not to the same degree as in the case of operating costs. In 1989,&#13;
average charges covered one third of these costs, whereas in 1993 they covered one half.&#13;
4 .          Consequently, sanitation services are still highly subsidized, especially in light of the&#13;
opportunity cost of the capital allocated to them. In 1993, subsidies totaled about D 31 million,&#13;
allowing for the cost of this funding, or D 9 million if it is disregarded. It must be emphasized that,&#13;
because of the considerable degree of tariff adjustment over recent years and the uncovered cost of the&#13;
transferred capital, subsidies have definitely decreased, totaling about D 16 million in 1991.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-56-&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 2 of 34&#13;
5.           These subsidies are unevenly distributed among the various users. In 1993, they&#13;
ranged from about D 6.4 per user in the poorest of the residential blocks (0-20m3) to D 190 for the&#13;
highest block (150m3+). Subsidies per user in the other blocks were about D 28 (20-40m3), D 34&#13;
(40-70m3), and D 57 (70-150m3). Even compared to the total expenditures (or incomes) of the&#13;
households concerned, the succession of rates from the lowest to the highest blocks is clearly&#13;
degressive. However, this view of the figures must be qualified to some extent, since many of the&#13;
users in the 150m3+ block are not individuals. The discrepancies among subsidies become even&#13;
larger if the opportunity cost of the capital transfer is taken into account. As regards the productive&#13;
sector, it is charged more than the average cost (disregarding the opportunity cost of the capital),&#13;
except in the case of industries which generate little pollution, since these are subsidized.&#13;
Nevertheless, it should be noted that these subsidies were calculated by applying a single average&#13;
cost to both household users and the productive sector. This is unrealistic, because the waste water&#13;
treatment costs for industry, hotels and catering are probably higher than those for households.&#13;
6 .          This unequal distribution of subsidies is combined with a tariff structure in which&#13;
both the fixed and variable charges are certainly not progressive. The first impression is that the&#13;
consumers in the first block pay twice as much per m3 as those in the next block (2040n?), the&#13;
reason for this digressive effect being the size of the fixed charge applied to the first block. The&#13;
rates applied to the remaining blocks are fairly progressive, but only to a minor degree, because the&#13;
average tariff for the 150m3+ block is not even double that charged to the lowest block. A&#13;
reasonable objective, from the point of view of equity and social solidarity, would be to&#13;
considerably increase the differentials among these tariff levels.&#13;
Tariff Scenarios&#13;
7.           Alternative scenarios were prepared, taking into account the three objectives of&#13;
efficiency, financial equilibrium, and equity. The first requires that tariffs be calculated according&#13;
to the long-term marginal cost, which was found to be quite large (about D 1.100 per m3 for 1996).&#13;
The second objective depends on the approach adopted to the cost of sanitation; i.e. everything&#13;
depends on how the cost of capital is to be reckoned. Thus, financial equilibrium will be attained&#13;
with much lower tariffs if the capital transfers are regarded as free of charge than if they are&#13;
assigned a reasonable level of opportunity cost. Finally, the third objective calls for the adoption of&#13;
certain hypotheses regarding the social weightings assigned to the various income or expenditure&#13;
levels associated with the different blocks. The hypothesis assmed in the various scenarios is that&#13;
these weightings are in the same proportion as the different levels of total household expenditure (as&#13;
revealed by the National Statistical Institute's 1990 Survey of Consumption). As a result, the&#13;
weightings range from 1 (for the lowest block) to about 5.3 (for the 150m3+ household block).&#13;
The following scenarios were examined:&#13;
A tariff structure based on average costs, without payment of charges for the capital&#13;
transfers;&#13;

8% annual increases in tariffs from 1996;&#13;
15% annual increases in tariffs from 1996.&#13;
8.           Particular attention was given to the final three scenarios in the financial projections&#13;
presented separately below.&#13;
9.           The first and third scenarios have first been analyzed on the assumption that demand&#13;
is totally inelastic, and then that there is a negative demand response to tariff increases, with an&#13;
elasticity of 0.3. The latter case is important, because it takes account of the impact of tariff&#13;
adjustments on the demand for drinking water and sanitation services, and on ONAS revenue. A&#13;
model was prepared for solving the problem of the overlapping effect of average cost and demand.&#13;
10.   According to the first scenario (average costs without any payment of charges for capital&#13;
transfers, and no demand elasticity), the average tariff (both fixed and variable) for 1995 would&#13;
have been D 0.372 per in3. In 1993, it would have been D 0.321, compared with the actual charge&#13;
imposed, which was D 0.251, a difference of about 27%. If the proposed system of social&#13;
weightings were applied, the resulting distribution of this average cost among the various categories&#13;
of consumer would be very different from the current pattern. The average tariffs for the first and&#13;
second blocks would be reversed, and the tariffs applied to the remaining blocks would be&#13;
increased. In particular, the 150m3+ block would have paid D 0.325 per m3 in 1993, instead of D&#13;
0.250. Under the alternative hypothesis (with a demand elasticity in response to tariffs of 0.3), the&#13;
average tariff should be increased by between 3% and 4%. Financially, this scenario would&#13;
produce an operating surplus that would cover interest payments and probable exchange losses, so&#13;
that the break-even point would just be reached. Once the tariff matches this average cost, it will&#13;
be increased every year by a moderate amount that is very close to the projected overall inflation&#13;
rate (5%). It is clear, from both this scenario and the others, that the major problems arise from&#13;
the transition from the current tariff structure to one based on average cost, and not from any&#13;
subsequent tariff changes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-58-&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 4 of 34&#13;
11.         The other realistic scenario is that in which payments are made on capital transfers&#13;
only from 1995, at an annual rate of 8%. This scenario gives an average tariff of D 0.407 per m3&#13;
in 1996 (D 0.437 with an elasticity of 0.3), compared with the D 0.393 tariff in the preceding&#13;
scenario, but the rate of increase is comparatively high (15% in 1997), because of the need to pay&#13;
for an ever increasing amount of capital transfers. This scenario shows a net positive balance for&#13;
the fiscal period from 1996, totaling D 2 million this year and rising to about D 16 million in the&#13;
year 2000. Government transfers will remain stable from 1996 to 2000 (totaling D 33 million in&#13;
the year 2000, compared with D 50 million in scenario 1), despite the quite ambitious investment&#13;
program planned for this period.&#13;
12.         The scenario involving an increase in the average tariff at the rate of 10% per year&#13;
makes it possible to cover the average cost without payment on the transferred resources by the year&#13;
2001 and subsequently provide payments on those resources. The scenario based on an 8% rate of&#13;
increase would enable the average cost to be met only from the year 2006. For these two&#13;
scenarios, the tariff schedules have been drawn up on the basis of the same social weightings used&#13;
for the other scenarios.&#13;
13.         The other scenarios provide tariff adjusmewnts that can as theoretical references&#13;
(particularly, the scenario relating to tariffs at marginal cost), but implementation of these could not&#13;
be envisioned in the short or medium term.&#13;
14.         Finally, it should be emphasized that it is important to correct the current extremely&#13;
digressive tariff system operating between the first and second blocks. This can be done by&#13;
restructuring the billing in the first block by reducing the fixed charge (for example, from D1.3 to&#13;
D.05), and increasing the variable charge from D 0.006 to about D 0.080. This would make it&#13;
possible to make the following block pay a larger average variable charge than at present. This&#13;
adjustment could be spread over a number of years, so as to soften the impact on this category.&#13;
Financial Projections for the Three Scenarios Involving Tariff Inurase of 8%, 10% and 15%&#13;
per Year&#13;
15.         Three scenanos were prepared for balance sheet, income statement, and cash-flow&#13;
statement, based on the following hypotheses of tariff rates:&#13;
-     8 % annual increases in the average tariff from 1994;&#13;
10% annual increases in the average tariff from 1994;&#13;
15% annual increases in the average tariff from 1994.&#13;
In all three cases, the projections were made up to the year 2006.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-59-&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 5 of 34&#13;
16.         It should be noted that the tariff policy adopted has an impact not only on ONAS'&#13;
revenue as this is shown in the income statement, but also on indebtedness and inventories, and on&#13;
the commercial debts and equipment subsidies received on capital investments.&#13;
Hypotheses Relating to Items in the Balance Sheet&#13;
17.         Gross fixed assets increase every year by the amount of capital investment. For the&#13;
first three years (1994-96), investment is concerned with activities relating to "waste water" and&#13;
"storm water". Subsequendy, investment is made only in "waste water" activities. The volume of&#13;
investment is equivalent to D 80 million per year (in current dinars), and the process continues up&#13;
to the year 2006.&#13;
(i)    Current and other capital investments have been assumed to remain constant. The&#13;
level for the years from 1995 to 2006 is as shown in the balance sheet for 1994.&#13;
(ii)  Inventories have been assessed on the basis of average inventory turnover ratios&#13;
over a period of years (i.e. from 1989 to 1993).&#13;
(iii)   Receivables have been projected assuming an average collection period of 120 days.&#13;
This is based on calculations of the average collection periods in recent years.&#13;
(iv)   Changes in other liquid assets have been assumed to be at the rate of 5% per year&#13;
(i.e. the inflation rate).&#13;
(v)   Equity increases by the amount of new investment, plus the amount of debt&#13;
repayment, and minus new withdrawals and amortization.&#13;
(vi)   Projected long-term and medium-term debt and debts for periods of less than one&#13;
year are based on the schedule provided by ONAS. In the case of debts for periods of less&#13;
than one year, the figure shown on the balance sheet for any given year is equivalent to the&#13;
repayments planned for the following year.&#13;
(vii)  Other short-term debts have been assumed to increase at the same rate as inflation&#13;
(5%)&#13;
Assumptions Relating to operating costs and revenues&#13;
18.         Forecasts related to revenues and expenditures are as follows:&#13;
(i)   Income from services is assumed to increase at the rate of D 300,000 per year.&#13;
These activities are secondary, and the assumption seems realistic, in light of performance&#13;
over recent years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-60-&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 6 of 34&#13;
(ii)   Other revenues (i.e. Communes) are assumed to correspond to revenue from storm&#13;
water activities and give rise to an equivalent level of costs. The latter are calculated to be&#13;
12% of ONAS's total costs. This breakdown is based on the assumption that 1 km of the&#13;
storm water system is two times less expensive in costs than 1 km of the waste water&#13;
system. The storm water system constitutes only 20% of ONAS's total network, and&#13;
therefore 12% of costs are allocated to this activity.&#13;
(iii)   The State is supposed to cease providing operating subsidies once the average tariff&#13;
exceeds the average cost. These two parameters are included in the table of overall data for&#13;
each of the three scenarios. Once the average tariff exceeds the cost, the State no longer&#13;
pays the subsidy shown in the profit/loss account (under the heading "Autres produits"&#13;
[other revenues]). It must also be emphasized that the State also contributes to investment&#13;
in the form of an equipment subsidy, which is shown in the table of sources and&#13;
applications of funds (under the heading "Apport de l'Etat" [Government contribution]).&#13;
Once investment needs can be covered by the funds generated by the tariff policy, the State&#13;
will cease to provide this subsidy. Any surplus funds not used to finance such investment&#13;
must be paid to the State (under the heading "Versement a l'Etat" [Payment to the&#13;
Government]), as shown in the table of sources and applications of funds.&#13;
(iv)   The depreciation rate applied to fixed assets is a weighted average of the rates&#13;
applicable to the various fixed assets. The average rate is 4%, with an average depreciation&#13;
period of 25 years. Since the investment policy is the same in all three cases, the rate gives&#13;
the same total for depreciation in all three scenarios.&#13;
(v)   The annual amount of interest payments is taken from the debt repayment schedule&#13;
prepared by ONAS.&#13;
(vi)   Exchange losses are calculated to be 4% of the debt level, this being the difference&#13;
between inflation rates in Tunisia and the rest of the world, the local rate being about 4.5%,&#13;
while elsewhere it is from 2.5% to 3%.&#13;
(vii)  Exceptional items appear only prior to 1995, since real figures are given for this&#13;
year. This heading is left blank for other years, since such items, by their very nature, are&#13;
unforeseeable.&#13;
Definitions:&#13;
19.          The following definitions are used for the various parameters selected:&#13;
-     Internal cash generation ratio: intemal sources of funds/Fixed assets. This indicates the&#13;
rate at which capital costs are being recovered from tariffs.&#13;
&#13;

Debt service coverage ratio: intemal sources of funds/debt service.&#13;
Net working capital (fonds de roulement net): equity + medium and long-term debt -fixed&#13;
assets. It can be interpreted to be the surplus of invested capital (capitaux pemanents),&#13;
consisting of equity and debt with maturities beyond one year, that is usable in the operating&#13;
period because it is not used in financing the capital investment appearing in the balance&#13;
sheet.&#13;
Operating ratio:  operating expenses (excludes expenses on financial resources/Gross&#13;
revenues).&#13;
Working capital requirement (besoin en fonds de roulement): inventory + receivables -&#13;
payables. When positive, it can be interpreted as representing the total financing&#13;
requirements for an enterprise's operations. Generally, it is broken down into a "cyclical"&#13;
working capital requirement (the level of this depending on the volume of activity) and a&#13;
"non-cyclic" requirement, essentially depending on contingencies. A reduction in the&#13;
balance sheet can be interpreted as a reduction in ONAS' financing needs, and therefore as&#13;
a resource or intemally generated capital that can be added to the cashflow.&#13;
Cashflow (tresorerie):  net working capital - working capital requirement.  Financial&#13;
equilibrium is reflected in a balanced cash flow (i.e., one that is slightly in surplus).&#13;
Gross cash flow: total revenues (charges to consumers + services + local govemment&#13;
contributions + environment subsidies - operating costs already paid (waste water + storm&#13;
water).&#13;
20.   The debt service coverage and intemal cash generation ratios were calculated from&#13;
forecasted financial statements. These two ratios are the ones covenanted in the previous loan&#13;
agreements. They focus on two objectives: ONAS capacity to contribute in its investment program&#13;
and the repayment of its debt.&#13;
conclusions&#13;
21.   The three scenarios can be assessed in light of various criteria. The results appear in the&#13;
tables annexed to this report, and lead to the following main conclusions:&#13;
Operating equilibrium: In light of the hypotheses assumed, the three scenarios produce&#13;
results that are at least equivalent to zero.  In fact, the balancing subsidy that the&#13;
Government donates to ONAS is supposed to equal the difference between the average cost&#13;
and the average tariff. It is no longer to be provided once the latter increases. At this&#13;
point, ONAS begins to make a profit. Financial equilibrium, without an operating subsidy,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

is achieved in 1999 with the 15% scenario, in the year 2001 with the 10% scenario, and in&#13;
2004 with the 8 % scenario.&#13;
Payment of subsidies for investments by the Govermnent: According to the hypotheses&#13;
adopted, the Government annual subsidy equals the difference between, on the one hand,&#13;
annual total investment and debt repayments (i.e. applications) and, on the other, new&#13;
borrowings, depreciation, contributions from consumers, and surpluses (which are&#13;
resources). Changes in these capital investment depend on the particular tariff scenario in&#13;
question. With the 8% scenario, the Government continues to provide subsidies until 2006,&#13;
indicating that until that time ONAS will be unable to finance its investments through&#13;
intemally generated funds or by borrowing. With the 10% scenario, subsidies end in 2004,&#13;
and in 2001 in the case of the 15% scenario.&#13;
- bnancial equilibnum as measured by the level of cash on band shown in the balance&#13;
sheet: From this point of view, the three tariff scenarios (8%, 10% and 15%) enable&#13;
ONAS to achieve a positive cash on hand, rising from D 10 million in 1995 to D 1 million,&#13;
D 4 million and D 16 million, respectively, in 2006. The level of cash on hand achieved&#13;
under the 15% scenario may appear excessive.&#13;
-     Changes in financial parameters: The first paramneter is internal cash generation ratio&#13;
which affects the ratio between internally generated funds and average investment. It depends on&#13;
ONAS's self-financing capacity. It stands at about 23% in 1995, and reaches 100%, 150% and&#13;
320% by the year 2006 for the 8%, 10% and 15% scenarios, respectively. These trends confirm&#13;
the conclusions drawn with regard to the Government's subsidy for investments. The second&#13;
parameter calculated is the debt service ratio, i.e. internally generated funds/debt servicing, the&#13;
latter being the total for interest payments, exchange losses, and repayments of debt principal.&#13;
From a level of 0.8 in 1995 for all three scenarios, this ratio rises in 2006 to 2.6 for the 8%&#13;
scenario, 3.8 for the 10% scenario, and to 8.0 for the 15% scenario. The third parameter is the&#13;
ratio of equity and total indebtedness. This rises from 25% in 1995 to 34%, 36% and 45%,&#13;
respectively. This is logical, since the substantial rate of increase in tariffs results in a considerable&#13;
level of financial independence. The final ratio to be considered is the working capital ratio,&#13;
consisting of current assets/short-term debt. This ratio also provides a useful tool for measuring net&#13;
working capital. There are two important comnments to be made. First, in all three scenarios the&#13;
ratio is at all times greater than 1, indicating that the working capital ratio is positive throughout the&#13;
period. Second, assumptions relating to debt and investment are identical in all three cases, and the&#13;
surplus cash on hand resulting from increased tariffs is assumed to be offset by a reduction in the&#13;
Government's contribution in the form of capital investment. The combination of these various&#13;
elements produces curves that are practically identical, i.e. because the levels of current assets and&#13;
short-term debts are of the same order.&#13;

22.          The main conclusion to be drawn from these calculations is that, in all three cases,&#13;
ONAS achieves operating equilibrium by the year 2006; depending on the size of the rate of&#13;
increase in tariffs. The 15% scenario suffers from the disadvantage of producing liquidity&#13;
disequilibrium, in addition to requiring a rate of increase in tariffs that consumers could probably&#13;
not afford.&#13;

Socio-Economic Evaluation and Economic Analysis of Subnroiects&#13;
The Demand Function and Demand Projections&#13;
1.           A model was created to evaluate the sensitivity of demand to price variations of both&#13;
water and sewerage services. The estimated elasticities provide information on customers' behavior by&#13;
their nature and by their need and could be helpful in simulating the effects of changes in the tariff&#13;
policy for water and sewerage. The elasticity of demand relative to prices is generally the same for&#13;
water as for sewerage. However, since the ONAS customer base is only a fraction of SONEDE's&#13;
customer base, it is possible that the parameters of the demand of ONAS' market are different from&#13;
those relevant to SONEDE's market. Separate estimates were calculated for household customers, the&#13;
tourism industry and industrial users. Within the household category, estimates of the demand were&#13;
obtained for each volume of consumption bracket. For the industrial users, the three brackets of&#13;
pollution intensity were used.&#13;
2.           Different price indicators were taken into consideration as follows: (i) the average&#13;
tariff at constant prices paid by the consumer, including the fixed and variable component of the tariff&#13;
plus taxes applied by ONAS and SONEDE during the 1983.I-1993.IV period for each consumption&#13;
bracket. This indicator implies that the consumer, taking his/her consumption decision, considers all the&#13;
components of the water bill; (ii) the marginal price paid for each consumption bracket in constant&#13;
prices; (iii) the difference, D, in absolute terms, between what the consumer would have paid if he/she&#13;
had paid all the water consumed and discharged at the marginal price and what he/she actually pays.&#13;
3.           For household consumption, the income effect was taken into consideration by using&#13;
(a) SMIG, for the estimate of the demand relative to the first consumption bracket; (b) the average&#13;
wage, for the middle consumption brackets; and (c) per capita income for the highest consumption&#13;
bracket and the estimate of the total demand function. For industrial consumption, the industrial added&#13;
value was considered as an indicator of the sector's revenue. For tourism consumption, revenue was&#13;
approximated using the number of nights and the capacity utilization.&#13;
4.           Details of the econometric models and results are in the project files. The estimate of&#13;
the price and income elasticity of the total water demand for ONAS is, respectively, around 0.5 and&#13;
0.3, revealing a considerable sensitivity to price variation. The following table summarizes the&#13;
elasticity values obtained for different consumption brackets:&#13;

5.          It appears that customers react to price variations with a temporary lag. Customers in&#13;
the lowest consumption bracket seem to be sensitive to price adjustments and very sensitive to SMIG&#13;
variation.  Price elasticity decreases in  higher consumption brackets; however,  the highest&#13;
consumption bracket is very sensitive to marginal price variations. For the industrial sector price&#13;
elasticities are generally high ranging around 1.2, 0.8, 0.6 for low, average and high polluting industries&#13;
respectively. The tourism sector seems to be less sensitive to price adjustments, with an estimated&#13;
price elasticity of demand of 0.3.&#13;
6.           The projections of the demand were based on the trend observed during the 1983-93&#13;
period. Other methodologies were used, including using the elasticity results commented on above.&#13;
All methodologies converged on a total demand projection of 302 M m3, all categories included, by the&#13;
horizon 2011. That means that the demand for water of ONAS' market should increase by 5% a year&#13;
on average. This result is consistent with the demand projections made during the preparation of the&#13;
Water Supply and Sewerage project (1994) which indicates a yearly average demand growth of 3%.&#13;
The 2% difference is explained by the improvement of the connection rate of ONAS, expected to&#13;
expand from 75% to 95% of SONEDE's market by year 2011.&#13;
Long-Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) of Sanitation&#13;
7.           The tariff policy of ONAS has been designed to address three main concerns: (a) the&#13;
recovery of operating costs; (b) the yearly adjustment of tariffs to reduce the impact on the consumers'&#13;
bill; and (c) the incidence of such readjustment on purchasing power of customers with the adoption of&#13;
a progressive block rate structure where higher consumption rates are charged higher marginal tariffs.&#13;
This tariff policy has not taken into consideration, however, the economic criterion of efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-91-&#13;
ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 3 of 20&#13;
8.           From an efficiency standpoint, the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) is the soundest&#13;
basis for a rational pricing policy. It is defined as the increment in capital and current cost needed&#13;
to meet the related projected increases in demand. As the following formnula shows, both the costs&#13;
and the incremental quantities of treated water have to be properly discounted. The practice of&#13;
LRMC pricing is designed for greater efficiency of existing capacity, as well as for an optimized&#13;
capacity expansion in the future, since no quantity of water will be collected and treated unless it is&#13;
worth to users at least as much as its marginal cost. If tariffs are fixed at much higher levels than&#13;
the LRMC, the existing capacity risks to remain unutilized. If, on the contrary, they are fixed at&#13;
much lower levels, the increasing demand could push decision makers to increase capacity, which&#13;
may not be the best allocation choice. A tariff policy based on LRMC would allow the production&#13;
capacity expansion to be tailored to the evolution of the demand which takes into account the costs&#13;
of resources. It can therefore reveal if consumers are willing to pay for the real cost of those&#13;
resources. There are other considerations that may shape pricing policy (financial equilibrium of&#13;
the ONAS, the equity or the social objective) which are not taken care of by using the LRMC&#13;
approach; however, efficiency remains a very important objective; for this reason, LRMC is a&#13;
meaningful benchmark by which one can assess the reasonableness of the pricing policy. The&#13;
following estimates are designed to determine such a benchmark.&#13;
9.           LRAIC formula&#13;
The LRMC is estimated using as best approximation the long run average&#13;
incremental cost (LRAIC). Applied only to a cubic meter of water collected, the LRAIC is as&#13;
follows:&#13;
LRAIC = 2 [(Rt + j - Rt-1) / (1 + iy] +  , [(It + j-1) / (1 + iY]&#13;
2 [(Qt +ji-Qt-1) /(1 + i)l&#13;
10.         Rt and Rt-1 represent the operatng costs, excluding depreciation and financial&#13;
charges, for the years t and t-1, respectively; Qt and Qt-1 the quantities of water collected,&#13;
transported and treated in years t and t-1, and It investment cost in year t. The parameter i is the&#13;
discount rate applicable to the charges and the quantities consumed; T is the calculation horizon&#13;
used, which must be sufficiently long in the case of sewerage in view of the fairly long life of the&#13;
investments. The LRAIC for year t is thus equal to the ratio between: (a) the sum of the current&#13;
value of the operating costs that will be incurred from year t onward and that of the investment&#13;
expenditures incurred from year t-1 onward (assuming a maturation period of 1 year); and (b) the&#13;
discounted sum of the incremental volumes of water collected, (transported and treated) calculated&#13;
in relation to year t-1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 4 of 20&#13;
11.         Application&#13;
Estimates of LRAIC were carried out for the collection, transport, and treatment&#13;
services, both aggregately and individually. Operating costs (Rt+j values) were estimated on the&#13;
basis of ONAS' operating accounts for similar capital investnents, using operating costs excluding&#13;
depreciation, financial charges, and foreign exchange losses; in accordance with marginal costing&#13;
principles, the latter three cost categories must be excluded since they represent capital expenditures&#13;
incurred in the past. The LRMC concept, is being geared to the future ("forward-looking"), takes&#13;
into account only future investment expenditures. With this approach, current charges must be&#13;
limited to the costs of non-investment related operational activities: namely direct and indirect&#13;
charges that relate to the sewerage activity. Connection (including maintenance) charges were also&#13;
excluded from the estimate since they relate to an ONAS activity that generates a separate billing&#13;
and, therefore, do not enter into water pricing policy considerations. Recurrent costs related to&#13;
storm-water investments, estimated to represent 12% of total recurrent costs, were also excluded&#13;
from the calculation. Expenditures for capital investments during the 1983-1993 period were taken&#13;
into account (see Table 4.1), to which projections for the Eighth Plan and the Ninth Plan were&#13;
added. These data allowed for a retrospective analysis of the LRAIC. Preliminary projections for&#13;
the 1997-2011 period, derived from "L'Etude de faisabilite 2011" and from the master plans for the&#13;
main urban areas were considered. Details of the data available are in the project files.&#13;
12.         Investment projections are based on the hypothesis that: (a) the connection rate of&#13;
ONAS, by the year 2011, will reach 95% of SONEDE's market; (b) the estimated demand growth&#13;
rate will be 5% for the 1994-2011 period decreasing at 3% between 2011-2021 and to 2% during&#13;
the 2021-29 period; and (c) an additional treatment capacity of 500,000 m3/d of waste water will be&#13;
installed, resulting in a treatment rate of 75 % of the water consumed and a capacity utilization of&#13;
89%. To achieve the above-stated objectives, a total investment cost of 1,500 M (in 1994 TD) is&#13;
estimated to be needed to finance the following categories of investment;&#13;
a)    Primary networks                              MTD 300&#13;
b)    Secondary networks                            MTD 400&#13;
c)    Treatnent plants                              MTD 450&#13;
d)    Rehabilitation of the existing network        MTD 310&#13;
e)    Equipment for rural areas                     MTD  40&#13;
13.         Investments in storm-water-related infrastructure were not included in the&#13;
calculations since they are a responsibility of the local government and ONAS is supposed to&#13;
recover fully the costs associated with these activities. As shown in Table 4.1, investments in the&#13;
1990's averaged much lower than the projected investments for the 1997-2011 period.&#13;

amounting to TD 43 M p.a. The projected investment needs reflect the ambitious objectives already&#13;
stated. TD 70 p.a. (in 1994 TD) to be implemented, however, this investment program will&#13;
require an even stronger political support for the sub-sector and a clear social preference for the&#13;
objectives of the program. Moreover, if investment costs are to be substantially recovered, the&#13;
consumers' willingness to pay for sewerage services will have to be taken into consideration as a&#13;
main criterion for investment choices. The main results of the analysis are sumarized, as follows:&#13;
(a)    Past and future LRAIC are estimated to be far higher than current tariffs. In 1993&#13;
and 1994 the average tariffs paid by consumers were respectively 0,214 and 0,248&#13;
TD/m3' respectively equivalent to 23% and 25% of LRAIC. Both compare&#13;
favorably to the 1985 level of 16%.&#13;
(b)   The tourism sector tariffs cover approx. 60% of LRAIC while the tariff applied to&#13;
the most polluting industrial consumers covers only 48%. The average tariff of&#13;
household customers set at 0,152 TD/m3 in 1993 is approximately 17% of LRAIC.&#13;
The highest consumption block, representing the marginal consumption which is the&#13;
most suitable to marginal pricing tarification, approximates 30% of LRAIC.&#13;
(c)    LRAIC of collection and transport accounts for 70%  of the total cost. If we&#13;
compare the average current tariff for all users only with this component of the&#13;
LRAIC, it still covers only 32% of LRAIC which is estimated at TD 0.37/r3. It&#13;
was impossible to distinguish the total investment costs accruing to the treatment of&#13;
industrial waste water for different levels of pollution; however, it is evident that the&#13;
tariff applying to the higher polluting industries, exceeding by 20% the LRAIC of&#13;
treatment, is far below the marginal cost of collection and treatment.&#13;
(d)   The observed differential between average tariffs and LRAIC would suggest that the&#13;
decision makers are motivated to install excessive capacity. It also suggests also that&#13;
the targeted objectives of the investrnent program do not take fully into account the&#13;
consumers' willingness to pay and their sensitivity to price adjustments, which will&#13;
be needed to sustain such an investment program. The unused capacity observed in&#13;
some of the WWTPs in the country, except for the Tunis area, indicates that ONAS&#13;
currently has difficulties in optimizing the use of its existing capacity. This may be&#13;
due to: (i) technical problems in channeling water to the WWTPs where customers&#13;
are spatially dispersed; (ii) the existence of cheaper altematives for customers, an&#13;
aspect not taken into consideration in the planning process; (iii) an overestimation of&#13;
people's willingness to connect; and (iv) a lower-than-expected connection rate for&#13;
the polluting industries due to the necessary pre-treatment requirements. A better&#13;
cost recovery of LRAIC could be obtained, even under the current tariff structure,&#13;
through higher connection rates that would optimize the use of the existing&#13;
infrastructure. This does require a coordinated effort among institutions, in&#13;
particular in the case of industrial consumers. Additional causes of excess capacity&#13;

include the high seasonality of demand in the coastal areas where the tourism sector&#13;
is quite developed.&#13;
(e)   Waste water treatment accounts for 30% of LRAIC and provides for a good, treated&#13;
water, which still has a very limited market. Until now, no treatment cost is&#13;
recovered on the provision of 20% of treated water for irrigation purposes. This is&#13;
inconsistent for a country of scarce water resources.&#13;
Economic Analysis of the Greater Tunis Sewerage Project&#13;
14.         Overview. The Greater Tunis Sewerage and Reuse Project consists of three main&#13;
groups of components: (a) rehabilitation, strengthening, and expansion of the network to fill the&#13;
gap in the connection rate accumulated in some areas, mainly low-income areas to meet future&#13;
demand and to improve the overall performance of the network; (b) increasing waste water&#13;
treatment capacity; and (c) rehabilitation and extension of the unitary network for storm water.&#13;
From the capital cost standpoint, all three components are considered an integral entity because they&#13;
all contribute to meet the objectives stated in the Master Plan prepared by ONAS. On the basis of&#13;
these objectives, the investment size is determined.&#13;
Rehabilitation, Strengthening and Expansion of the Collection and  rport&#13;
Network&#13;
15.         The development of the primary and secondary network will allow for an&#13;
improvement of the connection rates from 50% to 75% in the Tadhamen and Sedjoumi areas, while&#13;
in other areas the hypothesis is to connect 95% of the SONEDE market, by year 2011. The&#13;
rehabilitation and recalibration of the network in several areas comprises approximately 100 km of&#13;
primary network and 490 km of secondary network that will be instalWed under the proposed&#13;
project. This program is justified by the increase in consumption and maintenance needs of the&#13;
existing service.&#13;
Waste Water Treatment P1ants&#13;
16.         The urgent need for treatment capacity in the Greater Tunis area and the projected&#13;
population increase of approximately 800,000, by the year 2011, requires an extension of the&#13;
existing capacity which will be accompanied by the development of the network. The project&#13;
provides for the construction of a new WWTP in the El Attar area west of Tunis. The area was&#13;
chosen because it had the highest potential for the recycling of water for agricultural use and&#13;
because the site is environmentally compliant. The new treatment plant will provide for an&#13;
additional capacity of 34,000 kg DBO5tj. The project will also provide for the extension of the&#13;
WWTP of Sud-Meliane. The treatment capacity will be increased 15,000 kg DBOs/j.&#13;

Unitary Network and Storm Water Related Investments&#13;
17.         The project will provide for equipment and rehabilitation of the unitary network of&#13;
downtown Tunis and of the surrounding "oueds." In addition, storm water from the industrial&#13;
areas of Ben Arous and Meguine will be evacuated from Lake Sud as part of a long- term program&#13;
to reduce the pollution levels in the lake.&#13;
Benefit Estimates.&#13;
18.   The benefit of the project is measured as the utility or satisfaction that the consumer derives&#13;
from the project, which would not materialize without the project. The utility or satisfaction of the&#13;
consumer is measured by the interest he/she has for having a sewerage service. This interest is&#13;
measured by the willingness to pay for that service (WTP). Graphically, the utility is represented&#13;
by the surface beneath the demand curve of the sewerage service. The demand curve negatively&#13;
sloped, indicating that utility decreases for additional units of service provided. The WTP is the&#13;
price that the consumer is ready to pay for a given quantity. From the consumer's point of view, if&#13;
the price he/she pays is equal to his/her WTP, then the consumer's surplus is indicative of the net&#13;
benefit of the project.&#13;
19.         In practice, the demand for sewerage services is inseparable from the demand for&#13;
potable water to the extent that a distinct demand for sewerage services does not exist. The current&#13;
regulations require that each consumer be connected to the ONAS system, once it is available. In&#13;
order to have an estimate of the expected benefits of the project, an indirect demand curve was&#13;
derived. The official statistics from SONEDE and ONAS distinguish between the group of&#13;
customers (around 50% of SONEDE customers) who are only connected to the potable water&#13;
system (customers for which there is no ONAS network available) and the group of customers who&#13;
benefit from both services, namely water and sanitation, provided by SONEDE and ONAS. For&#13;
this group, ONAS has quarterly statistics on the number of customers, their consumption and their&#13;
tariffs. For each category, an average price of water and sewerage was then calculated. Through&#13;
an econometric model, the demand curve for water and sewerage relative to prices, income,&#13;
season, weather variability, and other relevant variables, was then estimated.&#13;
20.          The second group of customers benefit only from the water service. For this group&#13;
quarterly consumption was reconstructed, deducting the consumption per category by ONAS'&#13;
customers from the total consumption per category by SONEDE's customers. The average price of&#13;
water by category and the demand curve were then estimated. Since, it is very difficult to know if&#13;
the introduction of sewerage increases or reduces the consumption of water for a single customer,&#13;
three different hypotheses were taken into consideration: (a) consumption does not change (hyp. 1);&#13;
(b) a variation of + 3% in water consumption (hyp. 2); and (c) a variation of - 3% in water&#13;
consumption (hyp. 3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

21.          Within the household category, the statistics available at SONEDE are only&#13;
available for customers consuming less than 70 m3 per quarter, including approximately 92% of&#13;
household customers and 55% of total consumption'. The estimates for both groups (SONEDE and&#13;
ONAS-SONEDE) were done on homogeneous customer categories. This limitation can be&#13;
accepted knowing that future customers of ONAS are expected to be low-consumption customers.&#13;
The best econometric estimates of demand are the following:&#13;
LCOS = 1.48 - 0.165 LPOS + 1.103 LSMEANR - 0.074 S1 + 0.054 S2 + 0.18 S3&#13;
(-2.73)  (4.7)      (2.74)      (2.03)       (7.4)&#13;
LCS = -1.8 - 0.511 LPS + 0.729 LSMIGR (-4) - 0.0461 Si + 0.236 S2 + 0.285 S3&#13;
(-1.98)  (1.86)           (-1.83) (6.93)      (7.54)&#13;
Where:&#13;
LCOS = logarithm of consumption for the water sewerage group (SONEDE-ONAS)&#13;
LCS          = logarithm of consumption of the water group&#13;
LPOS = logarithm of the average price paid to SONEDE-ONAS&#13;
LPS   = logarithm of the average price paid to SONEDE&#13;
LSMEANR = logarithm of the average wage&#13;
LSMIG        = logarithm of the SMIG&#13;
S1, S2, S3    = dummy variables for 1st, 2nd and 3rd quarters&#13;
The price elasticity of demand for the water group is, therefore, 0.511, while for the water&#13;
sewerage group, is 0.165.&#13;
22.          From the demand estimates, it is possible to calculate the WTP that represents the&#13;
price that the consumers are willing to pay in each group for receiving a given quantity of service.&#13;
Given the value of the other variables, it is possible to obtain the WTP for the quarterly average&#13;
consumption. Table 4.6 indicates the WTP for the average customer in each of the four quarters&#13;
for the three scenarios. To estimate the total net benefit of the project, the following steps were&#13;
followed:&#13;
(a)   calculation of the net benefit per customer (difference between the average water&#13;
consumer's surplus and the average water-sewerage consumer's surplus);&#13;
(b)   calculation of the net benefit per rn3 according to the three scenarios (ratio between&#13;
the total benefit of the average customer divided by his/her average consumption);&#13;
(c)   calculation of the total net benefit by multiplying the net benefit per rn3 with the&#13;
additional water treated by the project.&#13;
The total share of domestic consumption for the first three blocks has been steadily increasing since&#13;
1983.&#13;

23.          The additional water treated by the project is estimated, assumning that the collection&#13;
of 80% of the water consumed by each customer, and that the connection rate will grow from 75 %&#13;
to 95% by the year 2011. The use of the system's capacity will vary according to the scenario&#13;
considered.&#13;
Cost Estimates&#13;
24.          Project costs, net of taxes, duties and price contingencies, are equivalent to&#13;
TD 156 M (end-1996). They have been transformed to constant 1994 prices and then broken down&#13;
into tradeables, non-tradeables, and labor. The conversion factors estimated in the economic&#13;
analysis of the Water Supply and Sewerage Project were used to transform these three categories&#13;
into economic prices. The conversion factors for the exchange rate, labor, and non-tradeables were&#13;
estimated at 1.2, 0.8 and 0.9. Sensitivity tests were then applied to these values.&#13;
25.          Recurrent expenditures were estimated at TD 0.22/rn3, based on ONAS' actual&#13;
experience over the last three years. They were then transformed into economic prices by applying&#13;
the average concession of 0.9 factor for investments.&#13;
ERR and sensitivity analysis&#13;
26.          The economic rate of return is estimated at 28 %, 24 % and 33 %, respectively to the&#13;
hypothesis (hyp 1, hyp 2, hyp 3) listed in para. 14 of this Annex. Sensitivity tests were carried out&#13;
on a set of variables as shown in table 4.9.&#13;
Sousse - Economic analysis of the investment project&#13;
27.          Among the urban areas which will benefit of the IV Sewerage Program during the&#13;
IX' Plan Sousse is the municipality where ONAS is thinking to launch its privatization program.&#13;
The World Bank is available for assisting ONAS with the necessary technical assistance to make&#13;
such a program successful. For this reason, a cost-benefit analysis of the investments foreseen in&#13;
Sousse was carried out and the results are shown in Tables 4.10 and 4.11. The same methodology&#13;
described in this annex was applied to Sousse, adapting it to the appropriate consumption and&#13;
investment costs foreseen in this case. As the ERR results indicate (23%, 19%, 27%, each rate&#13;
relating to each of the three hypothesis considered), the investrnents in Sousse are fully justified.&#13;
The Economic and Financial Viability of Re-using Treated Water in Agriculture&#13;
28.          The decision of recycling waste water for agricultural purposes should be based on a&#13;
comparison among alternatives and on a detailed analysis that is site-and project-specific. In&#13;
Tunisia, treatment of waste water has to meet specific effluent standards that are defined at the&#13;
national level. Let us consider, however, a system where minimum effluent standards could be&#13;
defined according to the vulnerability of the area and recipient body being considered and according&#13;
to the use mnade of the water in the recipient body. This minimum standard should be the resultant&#13;
of the consumers' WTP and the social preference for that qualitative objective.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-101-&#13;
ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 13 of 20&#13;
29.           Let us suppose that, the least-cost solution, C, is chosen and that this solution is site-&#13;
specific.  Let us suppose that the decision makers want to explore recycling of water for&#13;
agriculture. It is then possible that new sites and new technologies need to be considered. A&#13;
differential cost, Ci, should be estimated for the i combinations of, site technology, that are&#13;
available. The differential cost is the additional cost (saving) that can be estimated as directly&#13;
linked to the decision of re-using water in agriculture. This means a differential in treatment costs,&#13;
storage and transfer costs. For the sake of simplicity, let us suppose that there is only one site-&#13;
technology alternative, i = 1, with potential for re-use in agriculture. The choice between using&#13;
treated water or using fresh water should be made comparing the marginal cost of bringing fresh&#13;
water to the farm gate, and the differential cost Cu of treating, storing, and transferring the treated&#13;
water to the farm gate. If the LRAIC of water is higher than Gi than it would be economically&#13;
viable to re-use treated water in agriculture in that area. Another step of analysis is, however,&#13;
needed. Once it is understood which source of water is more viable to use, this cost should be&#13;
compared to the benefits of irrigation. If the net return on the cultivation g are higher than the cost&#13;
of irrigating, then it will be economically viable to invest in the irrigation scheme. The latest step&#13;
could be worked out differently if it is estimated that the presence of nutrients in the treated water&#13;
can produce a substantial benefit as compared to the use of fresh water. In this case, the full&#13;
economic analysis for the two alternatives, fresh water applied to cultivation g, and, treated water&#13;
applied to cultivation g, should be carried out and the results compared. This step is necessary&#13;
when LRAIC of water is lower than Cui. The complexity of the issue suggests that decisions on&#13;
which strategy to use for waste water re-use need to be made in close coordination with all parties&#13;
concerned and that a clearer understanding is necessary regarding options for irrigated crops and&#13;
their future market developments.&#13;
30.           From ONAS' financial perspective, if the differential cost Ci is positive and exceeds&#13;
the current price of water (as it is likely to be) there is little chance that ONAS will be able to&#13;
recover even part of the G costs. In areas where private farmers have to pump water from wells or&#13;
where fresh water cannot meet the peak demand, the waste water re-use option could produce not&#13;
only economic but also financial benefits. Other issues relative to the increment in land value&#13;
brought about by the availability of water (treated or fresh) and therefore of irrigation should be&#13;
considered when looking at how ONAS could cost-recover the differential cost, Ci. Capturing that&#13;
benefit (or part of it) could be looked at as a possible solution to the cost-recovery issue.&#13;
Benefits of re-use of treated waste water&#13;
31.           An attempt to evaluate the economic opportunity of irrigating with treated water&#13;
a pilot perimeter was made. The cost estimates are however complex due to the multipurpose&#13;
nature of the waste water treatment investment. In this particular case, the location and the&#13;
technological alternative are influenced mainly by environrmental quality standards that are&#13;
quite stringent. The estimated cost of treatment would have been met with or without the re-&#13;
use of treated water in agriculture, since quality standards are basically the same for restrictive&#13;
irrigation and discharge of treated water into water bodies (in fact, slightly more stringent in&#13;
the latter case)2. Treatment costs are not considered , therefore, while calculating the additional&#13;

(2000/lOOml) and the WHO recommended level for unrestrictive use of treated water in agriculture (1000/llOOml)&#13;
induce only minor additional costs. Tunisian standards for restricve use of effuents in agriculture do not foresee&#13;
any limit for coliforms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

costs of irrigating the perimeter. Another difficulty is linked to the different volume for which&#13;
some investments are designed; the investments within the irrigated perimeter are calculated on&#13;
the basis of equipping only 1000 ha. The pipe transporting treated water to the irrigated&#13;
perimeter and the pumping station are on the contrary able at full capacity to satisfy the full&#13;
extension of the perimeter up to 6,000 to 8,000 ha.&#13;
32.   Taking into consideration all these factors, it was estimated that an additional cubic&#13;
meter of treated water used at the perimeter level has an additional economic cost ranging&#13;
between TD 0,150/m3 and TD 0,350/m3. Compared to the opportunity cost of water in the&#13;
"Tel Inf6rieur" (Bizerte, Tunis and Cap Bon areas)of about 350 DT/m33 (being such a value&#13;
an average, one would expect it to be higher in the Cap Bon area), the use of treated water in&#13;
the greater Tunis area appears to be economically feasable. Such estimates (the opportunity&#13;
cost of water in the "Tel Inf6rieur" and the additional cost of treating water in agriculture)&#13;
have to be however considered preliminary and need to be studied in much higher detail.&#13;
33.          We have then considered that the treated waste water could be used for the&#13;
cultivation of cereals. The increase in productivity due to irrigation is between 20 to 30 quintals per&#13;
hectare; the irrigation needs are around 2,000 m3/ha. Considering an international price for cereals&#13;
of TD 19-20 quintal, the ERR of the pilot scheme ranges between 6% to 8% according to different&#13;
hypothesis on investment cost share. The benefits and the ERR of this component could be higher&#13;
if one considers higher value crops such as citrus or other tree fruits. Ad hoc data indicate that the&#13;
net return for these crops could be as high as TD 0.230 to 0.400/m3 while that of cereals ranges&#13;
between TD 0,054/n3 to TD 0.066/n3. The feasibility study for the re-use component, which is&#13;
a condition of loan disbursement for that component, should include farm budget analysis to&#13;
reduce the risk that farmers will not want to use treated waste water while appropriate&#13;
institutional arrangements for setting up a cost-recovery scheme of the re-use component&#13;
should be explored.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA&#13;
GREATER TUNIS SEWERAGE AND REUSE PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
Environmental Assessment and Mitigation Plan&#13;
1.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1         Under the environmental guidelines of the World Bank (Operational Directive&#13;
4.01), the Greater Tunis Sewerage Project has been classified as a Category A project. This report&#13;
is an enviromnental review which summarizes the environmental impacts of the proposed project&#13;
and provides recommendations for impact mitigation under Annex C of the Directive.&#13;
1.2   Greater Tunis Program: The program, focusing mainly on the Tunis area, consists of the&#13;
following:&#13;
Sewerage Treatment Facilities:&#13;
*     The construction of a WWTP in the Tunis West area for a capacity of 850,000 inhabitants&#13;
equivalent to be constructed on a BOT basis.&#13;
*     The doubling of the capacity of the existing WWTP of Sud Meliane in the southern part of&#13;
Tunis by additional treatment capacity of 375,000 inhabitants equivalent&#13;
Rehabilitation and Extension of Sewerage Networks:&#13;
*     The reorganization of the existing sewerage network of Tunis West area in order to revert a&#13;
sizable part of the waste water flow to the new basin.&#13;
*     The strengthening of the primary network of Tunis south and the construction of a liaison&#13;
pipe between the WWTP's of Cotiere Nord and Choutrana.&#13;
*     The construction of seven pumping stations.&#13;
1.3         The preparation of the project has benefited from a comprehensive environmental&#13;
study. The Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) has provided a qualitative framework on the&#13;
situation of waste water management and disposal and how it could be improved, not only in the&#13;
scope of the project at hand but also for future investment in this field. The Project Specific&#13;
Assessments (PSA) have examined the different site location alternatives, determiined the design of&#13;
the treatment process for each of the plants for the selected locations and identified the related&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

environmental impacts and possible mitigation measures. In addition to this environmental analysis,&#13;
ONAS is required by Tunisian law to undertake an environmental assessment to satisfy the&#13;
requirements defined by ANPE.&#13;
1.4         This environmental review is based on results of the environmental assessments&#13;
(PSA' s) undertaken for each of the treatment plants proposed, the technical studies and the findings&#13;
of the pre-appraisal mission. A series of technical meetings were held with ONAS, ANPE, the&#13;
concerned departments in the respective ministries of Environment and Territorial Planning, and&#13;
Housing and Equipment and Agriculture to discuss the different alternatives of project design and&#13;
their respective impacts on the environment. Another series of meetings were conducted with the&#13;
Consultants who undertook the SEA and PSAs. A number of field visits to investigate the potential&#13;
problems of the sites were also made.&#13;
2.    DESCRIPIION OF THE PROGRAM&#13;
2.1   The Waste Water Treatment Plant of Tunis West&#13;
2.1.1       The project envisaged for the area of Tunis West has been designed to reach full&#13;
capacity by the year 2011. The amount of collected waste water is estimated at 59,000 cubic meter&#13;
per day with a pollution load of 34,000 BOD5. It will comprise the construction of:&#13;
(a)   a primary treatment plant at the discharge point, including a major pumping station&#13;
on the shore of Sebkha Sejoumi;&#13;
(b)   a secondary treatment plant on a site near the village of El Attar located 7,5 km&#13;
west uphill of the Sejoumi site; and&#13;
(c)   a pressure pipe for waste water between the plant in Sejoumi and the plant at El&#13;
Attar.&#13;
The treatment foreseen is the activated sludge process after primary sedimentation. The methane&#13;
produced by the anaerobic digester for sludge mineralization will be used in the treatment plant&#13;
making it self-sufficient in energy requirement.&#13;
2.1.2       Also envisaged are the construction and rehabilitation of 213 km of sewerage&#13;
systems, allowing for 20,000 new hook-ups. For some parts of the existing systems, the direction&#13;
of flow will be reverted from existing overcharged treatment plants of Cotiere Nord and Choutrana&#13;
to the proposed Tunis West plant. The plant as described will cover a large area of the capital&#13;
serving 850,000 inhabitants equivalent; making it one of the largest treatment plants in Tunisia. The&#13;
achievable hook-up rate is estimated to reach 75 percent. The type of teatment chosen is the&#13;
activated sludge process with anaerobic digestion of sludge and energy recovery.&#13;
&#13;

2.1.3        Site Selection: The site selection process for the location of this treatment facility&#13;
was based on three major factors: (a) the traditional cost-benefit analysis for optimization of the&#13;
choices both from  the environmental and the economic feasibility standpoints;  (b)  the&#13;
recommendations made by the SEA and the provisions of the planning tools in exercise; and (c)&#13;
the decision to integrate the reuse of treated water as the viable environmental and economic option&#13;
(see paragraph 3.4 of this annex). Four site locations were analyzed and on the completion of this&#13;
process, the alternative described (in parag 2.1.1 of this Annex and in Annex 2) was selected. The&#13;
site and the whole circuit of the effluent, which was inspected in the field, presents the best&#13;
location mainly due to:&#13;
*     the potential for treated water reuse for agriculture is the greatest with the possibility&#13;
of creating 6,000 to 8,000 hectares of newly irrigated land ( para 5.1- 5.2);&#13;
*     the effluent (the excess effluent that may not be reused) will have a longer route&#13;
before reaching the sea. This has the advantage that more nutrients will be naturally&#13;
purified;&#13;
*     the site is large and isolated, and presents along the effluent route the potential for&#13;
natural storage of the treated water for reuse in agriculture; and&#13;
*     lack of conflicting land uses.&#13;
2.1.4        The primary site of the plant is located on Sebkha Sejoumi. The latter, mostly dry&#13;
except where untreated waste water is discharged, occasionally floods the residential areas on its&#13;
banks during rainy weather. A protection dike is projected in the zone where the plant is planned.&#13;
The land, a lot of 10 hectares, is publicly owned and is in the process of being transferred to&#13;
ONAS. The whole area is densely urbanized with a number of substandard settlements. In the&#13;
southern direction is the village of Sidi Hassine and in the other directions, the site is surrounded by&#13;
busy roads (MC 37). Beyond these roads to the North lie the residential areas and some light&#13;
industries to the west. The secondary site at El Attar is a farmland cultivated (cereals) by a public&#13;
owned cooperative. The land area needed for this part of the plant amounts to 100 hectares. The&#13;
nearest houses are at a distance of 800 meters in the village of El Attar. It is a semi arid area with&#13;
saline, unusable ground water.&#13;
2.2   The Waste Water Treatment Plant of Tunis South&#13;
2.2.1        The planned treatment plant of Tunis South has been conceived as an extension of&#13;
the existing plant of Sud Meliane. It has been designed to reach full capacity by the year 2011,&#13;
when the amount of collected waste water is estimated at 60,000 m3 per day with a pollution load of&#13;
30,000 per day BOD5. The site of the current plant is sufficient enough to harbor the proposed&#13;
extension which will double existing capacities. The achievable hook-up rate is estimated at 75&#13;
percent. It will be composed of:&#13;
(a)   a pumping station and a pressure pipe of 4 km;&#13;

3.  SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS&#13;
3.1          The proposed project will improve the quality of sanitation services, reduce&#13;
environmental pollution and mitigate health hazards from waste water discharges in the national&#13;
capital region through the facilities described above. The most significant positive and negative&#13;
impacts that the project will generate are summarized below.&#13;
Positive Impacts&#13;
3.2          The construction of the treatment facilities will have a strong positive effect on the&#13;
overall environment at each proposed location.  It will prevent the intense negative impacts on&#13;
human health and urban nuisances associated with the discharge of untreated sewage directly into&#13;
the environment from the sewage collector system at discharge points and, hence, decrease the&#13;
exposure to waste water related diseases (e.g., gastro-intestinal) of the affected urban population.&#13;
The rehabilitation and construction of new sewers will enhance further the quality of life in the&#13;
urban areas, especially for those settlements with insufficient infrastructure networks and higher&#13;
housing density. More than 150,000 low income population are expected to directly benefit from&#13;
the project.&#13;
3.3          There will also be improvement of the water quality in the streams that flow&#13;
throughout the city.  A major benefit is the protection of the groundwater resources from&#13;
contamination by untreated sewage and the preservation of the marine environment and other&#13;
vulnerable water bodies (lagoons, oueds and sebkhas) from further eutrophization.  As a result,&#13;
economic benefit will occur in terms of increased water volume of good quality, and increased&#13;
fisheries and tourism activities along the coast near Tunis.&#13;
3.4          Furthermore, the treatment facilities will provide an opportunity to improve the&#13;
control of the industrial discharges through pretreatment and connection to ONAS sewers, as&#13;
required by the Tunisian law. For the Sud Meliane plant, potential industries with non-compliant&#13;
waste waters have already been identified. Within the framework of the FODEP activity, these&#13;
industries will benefit from a program which has materialized in the construction of an industrial&#13;
pretreatment unit that will be connected to the proposed plant.&#13;
3.5          Finally, above all, the environmental aspect which lays at the heart of the whole&#13;
conception process of this project, has, iteratively, influenced the design of this project and of the&#13;
WWTP's, their site locations and the quality and use of their by-products. Two major elements&#13;
around which this process has revolved are the protection of the environment and the valorization&#13;
of the scarce water resources through the reuse of the treated water. Indeed, in the case of Tunis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-113-&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 5 of 16&#13;
West' WWTP (para 2.1.1 to 2.1.3) the flow of the existing sewerage system, for a sizable part of&#13;
the covered area, will be reverted to the newly identified western basin where it will be treated in&#13;
the proposed WWTP. This, on the one hand, prevents the effluent from being discharged into the&#13;
Gulf of Tunis, the sea and other vulnerable RWB. On the other hand, it offers the advantage of&#13;
using this effluent for irrigation or recharge of the groundwater resources (para 5.1-5.4). Hence,&#13;
generating significant economic and social benefits, in addition to the environmental&#13;
Negative Impacts&#13;
3.6          During the construction and rehabilitation of the sewer network and the construction&#13;
of the treatment facilities, impacts of minor importance and magnitude are expected to occur.&#13;
These impacts are temporary and will include: disruption of traffic pattern in the serviced areas of&#13;
the city, interference with other urban infrastructures, disrupted access to residential or/and other&#13;
buildings, change in the landscape (loss of vegetation), noise nuisances and air pollution due to&#13;
dust formation. The project activities do not require any resettlement.  During operation of the&#13;
treatment plants, some of these minor physical impacts will continue to occur.  It is, actually, the&#13;
case for odor and gas emissions and noise.&#13;
4.    M1TIGATION MEASURES&#13;
4.1          Mitigation of the possible negative impacts of the WWTPs was approached as an&#13;
on-going process that was made part of the conception and the technical design of the different&#13;
components and aspects of the project. As a result, most mitigation measures are already imbedded&#13;
and reflected in the choices made from site selection till routing of the effluent and its reuse.&#13;
4.2          Furthermore, the mitigation plan on pages 7 to 15 of this annex, presents a detailed&#13;
list of all the possible impacts that could occur in this project during the different phases of the&#13;
project implementation cycle, comprising: (a) rehabilitation and construction phase of the sewer&#13;
networks; (b) the construction phase of the treatment facilities; and (c) the operation phase of the&#13;
plants. For each of the possible source of impacts or type of project activity, the nature of the&#13;
impact is described and actions for remedy are listed. The responsibilities for these actions are&#13;
defined and the concerned agencies identified. An environmental management plan is also&#13;
proposed.&#13;
4.3          A monitoring program is recommended for the sewer networks and the treatment&#13;
plants (mitigation plan). In addition to what is currently done by ONAS, through its laboratories,&#13;
specific monitoring of the properties of both the influent and effluent will be performed and&#13;
assessed against the norms for agriculture reuse. The use of the sludge as fertilizer is strongly&#13;
recommended The monitoring program will also continue to evaluate all possible other impacts on&#13;
the environment including ambient air, soils and vegetation, and the RWBs downstream effluents.&#13;
4.3          A program for institutional strengthening of ONAS' technical, organizational and&#13;
managerial capacities is also foreseen. It will cover the regional departments and will include a&#13;

Geographic Information System  component.  Furthermore, reinforcement of the existing&#13;
institutional machinery is recommended along the lines of the SEA's findings as described in para&#13;
1.10 to 1.15 of the SAR.&#13;
4.4          The main impacts and related mitigation measures for the treatment plants are&#13;
summarized below:&#13;
The Tunis West Treatment Plant:&#13;
Emission of polluted water: The proposed project will prevent emission of raw waste water in the&#13;
served areas from currently overcharged plants to a very important extent and, hence, improve&#13;
considerably the sanitation of a sizable part of the capital urban areas. It will also relieve Sebkha&#13;
Sejoumi from the current discharges and possible flooding of its banks. However, it may present&#13;
some risks. The major one remains the discharge of the effluent into the environment if the reuse&#13;
option is not pursued. The plant is designed to produce a disinfected effluent with a quality to meet&#13;
the standards for irrigation. It will, however, contain high nutrient concentrations which will&#13;
contribute to the ongoing accumulation of nutrients in the Gulf of Tunis. The latter, being highly&#13;
vulnerable to eutrophization, this will cause further deterioration of the sea grass fields and bloom&#13;
of algae. The effluent, if discharged in the closeby Oued El attar will also affect the Mejerda&#13;
downstream, but to a lesser extent than the Gulf of Tunis. It is estimated that the effluent will&#13;
increase by 1 % the flow of this section of the Mejerda adding to its already rich load of nutrients.&#13;
Mitigation: The project has integrated a component to be implemented by the Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture (para. 2.6) consisting of a program for reuse of the treated water. This&#13;
program will be designed and implemented in close coordination with the Ministry of&#13;
Environment, ONAS and the ANPE. In order to avoid completely any possible&#13;
discharge in the Mejerda, the routing of the effluent (in case it is not entirely used for&#13;
irrigation) will be diverted from Oued El Attar area in the Westem Basin to a tributary&#13;
of Oued Meliane in the Southern Basin. It would be still advisable to remove the&#13;
nutrients, by means of additional treatment, if the effluent is to be discharged into the&#13;
Oued and, in final stage, into the Gulf. Alternatively, other destinations of the effluent&#13;
should also be explored by the study planned in this project.&#13;
Emission of waste: The plant will also produce an estimated 90 m3 per day of stabilized, dried&#13;
sewage sludge that will be sold to farmers in the irrigation area or else transported to a controlled&#13;
dumping site. Construction of a solid waste treatment plant under study is proposed for the close&#13;
vicinity of El Attar site.&#13;
Mitigation: The sludge produced so far by ONAS' existing treatment plants has been&#13;
of good quality and has been in high demand by farmers. However, irregular&#13;
emissions into the sewer systems could drastically change its quality as well as the&#13;
quality of the effluent, which in turn will be damaging to the environment and public&#13;
health. ONAS monitors carefully sewage collected at each of its operating WWTP's,&#13;
through on-site laboratories and a sophisticated central laboratory.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-115-&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 7 of 16&#13;
Emissions into the air: The waste water treatment plant will also have local impacts in the form of&#13;
odor and gas emissions into the ambient air as well as noise. At El Attar, odor will be emitted by&#13;
the sedimentation basins causing nuisance up to 500 meters beyond the plant's limits. The methane-&#13;
driven generator for aeration will cause emission of NO, et C02. A torch (5 m height) will be&#13;
needed too for flaring methane surplus.&#13;
Mitigation: At the Sejoumi plant, odor emissions will be controlled by covering the&#13;
equipment and treating the air in a biofilter. In El attar, the site is isolated and there&#13;
are no houses in the close vicinity.&#13;
Urban Planning Aspect: In addition to the already existing urban settlements in the vicinity of the&#13;
plant at Sejoumi, the area is planned, according to the provisions of the Master Plan, to be further&#13;
developed into a residential quarter with average to high density.&#13;
Mitigation: It is foreseen to install a buffer zone of no less than 500 meters around&#13;
the site to prevent any negative impacts to the health of the inhabitants of the planned&#13;
residential development. Within the scope of this project, the Department of Urban&#13;
Planning will be notified in order to make provision for such measure into the Master&#13;
Plan, currently under study.&#13;
The Sud Meliane Treatment Plant&#13;
Emission of polluted effluent: The effluent will be pumped from Sud Meliane Plant and diverted&#13;
backward to the hinterland area constituted first by the Mornag plain and further south and west by&#13;
the plain of Bou Rbii and that of Sidi Shrif. The effluent will be used in the Mornag area where an&#13;
irrigation perimeter of 1000 hectares is currently in use and planned to be extended with an&#13;
additional 1000 hectares perimeter. This diversion prevents from discharging the sewage directly&#13;
into Oued Meliane and in a relatively near distance to the Gulf. Further reuse for irrigation is also a&#13;
valuable option in the plain of Bou Rbii and at a later stage in the area of Bir Mchergua.&#13;
Mitigation: These and other alternatives for the use of the effluent will be further&#13;
explored in the study to avoid any direct discharge in Oued Meliane, which in such a&#13;
case would necessitate additional treatment to prevent adverse effect on the marine&#13;
ecosystem .&#13;
Emission of waste: It is estimated that the production of sludge will reach 38 m3 per day. In this&#13;
area of Tunis south, the sludge currently produced is being used entirely by farmers.&#13;
Mitigation: If unused, the sludge will be dumped into controlled landfills.&#13;
Emission of other nuisance: The plant will produce regular emission of odor into the air and noise.&#13;
Mitigation:   The odor emission will be unacceptable with the doubling of plant&#13;
capacity in highly urbanized area. In addition the intemational sport complex will be&#13;

located just in front of the plant, across the road. Simple measures such as covering,&#13;
evacuating and treating the air with biofilters will be used.&#13;
5.  THE REUSE OF TREATED WASTE WATER&#13;
5.1         Reuse Potential in Tunis West. El Attar is located just over the water separation&#13;
of the Mejerda river basin with a large area of land suitable for irrigation, located on the sides of&#13;
the hills overlooking the Chaffrou valley. This land (6,000 to 8,000 hectares) is suitable for&#13;
cultivation of fruit trees, fodder and cereals. Within this project a program of reuse has been&#13;
worked out with the Ministry of Agriculture in coordination with ONAS. It will consist of an initial&#13;
phase covering an area of 1000 hectares to be gradually extended. Consultation with the concerned&#13;
agriculture departments proved that there are no technical, socio-economic or cultural obstacles for&#13;
effluent irrigation in this area. The activated sludge treatment process coupled with disinfection&#13;
will produce an effluent with a suitable quality for irrigation.&#13;
5.2         To be able to use the effluent, construction of a storage basin and distribution works&#13;
will be required. These will be the responsibility of the agriculture sector (see Annex 2).&#13;
Preliminary studies have located a suitable site for a storage basin close to the plant. Increased&#13;
storage capacity, using the natural depressions of the land nearby the site of the plant could also be&#13;
achieved at reasonable cost. These basins, of a total capacity not to exceed 2 million m3, of low&#13;
volumne and fully integrated in the geomorphology of the site of the irrigation area, are not expected&#13;
to generate negative impacts. There is no vegetation in the whole area and very few scattered&#13;
houses are to be found in the far vicinity of the site. No resettlement is foreseen.  It is sought to&#13;
make the effluent available for non-restrictive irrigation when the recommended changes in&#13;
legislation are made. In the meantime, only restrictive irrigation will be allowed. The full debit&#13;
could be reused by 2011, creating up to 8,000 hectares and possibly extending to the neighboring&#13;
zone.&#13;
5.3         Reuse Potential in Sud Meliane. For the existing plant of Sud Meliane, the reuse&#13;
has currently attained 40 percent of the identified irrigable land (fruit and olive trees), counting&#13;
1000 hectares and located in the plain of Momag. This low percentage is due to the defective state&#13;
of the irrigation infrastructure in place. Investments need to be done to renew and/or rehabilitate&#13;
this infrastructure. This could result in an increase in the present potential of reuse to a higher&#13;
percentage and open up the possibility of extending the current irrigation area by another 1000&#13;
hectares, that have already been identified. Further south, the Bou Rbii plain could also benefit&#13;
from the reuse program.&#13;
5.4          Other Reuse Applications. The Ministry of Agriculture will undertake within this&#13;
project a pilot operation to experiment the use of treated water for recharge purposes. The aquifer&#13;
recharge for the renewal of the ground water resources necessitates refined treatment of the&#13;
effluent. The pilot operation to be located in the Cap Bon area using the effluent from a local newly&#13;
built treatment plant is meant to explore the possibility of creating a hydraulic barrier to stop the&#13;
intrusion of the sea water. Other reuse applications will also be studied.&#13;

6.    PUBLIC CONSULTATION&#13;
6.1         Public Consultation. Due to the environmental category of this project but mostly&#13;
to the important role the planned investments will play in the Tunis area at the economic, social and&#13;
environmental levels, a consultation with the public was conducted. It took place and at an early&#13;
stage of project preparation and encompassed at different stages several institutions and populations&#13;
groups concerned by the project , including various NGO, farmers groups and associations,&#13;
governmental and professional institutions. Particular attention, through repeated visits, was given&#13;
to the local farmers and inhabitants and the municipal authorities. The recommendations of the&#13;
consulted groups were integrated in the design of the project.&#13;
6.2         In addition, a one day seminar, organized by ONAS, was held on July 23, 1996&#13;
under the leadership of the Minister of Environment and Territorial Planning. The seminar attracted&#13;
a large audience to which the project in its different aspects and components, including the reuse of&#13;
treated water, was presented and discussed. Valuable comments and recommendations were drawn.&#13;
The Bank mission examnined and supported these recommendations, that covered essentially the&#13;
areas of industrial pollution and the reuse of treated water. Most of these recommendations were&#13;
already embedded in the design of the project or proposed to be further examined in the context of&#13;
the Reuse Study to be financed by the Loan.&#13;
7.    MlTIGATION PLAN&#13;
7.1         A detailed mitigation plan covering all aspects of the project in its different phases&#13;
from construction to operation is presented below. In this plan, mitigation measures are proposed&#13;
for each environmental impact (that could eventually occur) according to its source, and the&#13;
originating activity. The responsibilities for each agency (ONAS, ANPE, etc..) are also defined and&#13;
the related specific tasks are precisely determined. The implementation of this plan depends on the&#13;
effective collaboration on the grounds of all the agencies involved. An estimate of the cost for the&#13;
implementation of this plan is presented below. The financing of ONAS component is made part of&#13;
its operating budget. Any specific material needed to be purchased could be done under the Loan&#13;
(miscellaneous).The remaining components will be financed by each responsible agency from their&#13;
own budget.&#13;

8.1         The environmental review concludes that the proposed project will generate&#13;
overwhelmingly positive environmental, social and economic impacts. With its mitigation&#13;
measures, the project does not present negative environmental consequences. The mitigation plans&#13;
stress the importance of project planning during the different implementation phases, institutional&#13;
strengthening and technical performance. ONAS, ANPE and the Ministry of Agriculture will&#13;
oversee and evaluate, for their respective part, the compliance and the effect of these plans. They&#13;
will also ensure proper coordination during implementation of these plans.&#13;

T'HE REUSE OF TREATED WASTE WATER&#13;
IN AGRICULTURE&#13;
SUMMARY&#13;
1.          In view of the growing scarcity of water resources in relation to increased&#13;
agricultural requirements in particular, and given the arid climate, irregular rainfall patterns and&#13;
increasing pressures on groundwater resources, the development of treated waste water for&#13;
agricultural purposes is considered to be a critical component of the integrated water resources&#13;
management policy.&#13;
2.          With an irrigable potential of close to 20,000 ha projected for the year 2000,&#13;
existing irrigation schemes cover some 6,500 ha, mostly (55%) in the area surrounding Tunis.&#13;
These schemes draw on an exploitable quantity of 35 Mm3.&#13;
3.          The reuse of treated waste water in irrigation schemes runs into certain problems&#13;
in terms of psychological acceptance, agronomic considerations and sanitation, which tend to limit&#13;
its full development (to 15 to 18%) despite the significant presence of fertilizing substances in&#13;
such waste water. Using treated waste water under restrictive conditions that limit farmer&#13;
incomes is one constraint to the development of irrigation schemes.&#13;
4.          Following the filling of the legislative gaps concerning the reuse of treated waste&#13;
water (bid documents, a list of crops that can be irrigated with treated waste water), the Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture, which is aware of the significant irrigation potential at stake, has formulated a&#13;
strategy to develop a model that is adapted to the specific conditions of the country. This model,&#13;
which will make it possible to greatly expand the reuse of treated waste water in the future under&#13;
totally safe conditions, will address all major technical, social and environmental concerns&#13;
(dimensions of irrigation schemes, irrigation techniques, choice of crops, size of farms, operating&#13;
conditions, extension, monitoring, etc.).&#13;
5,          Large-scale projects (such as Tunis West) warrant a thorough examination of the&#13;
average surface area of operating entities, the type of developments to be advocated (storage&#13;
&#13;

basins, lakes, recharging of aquifers) and the most appropriate method of irrigation, which&#13;
depends on the type of infrastructure adjoining the scheme (housing, surface wells, roads, etc.).&#13;
6.          In addition, it is important that improvements in transport, storage and maturation&#13;
facilities and the disposal of treated effluents should not have a negative impact on the natural&#13;
productive environment of the region. Compensatory improvements that prove necessary, for&#13;
example urban and industrial zone waste water treatment plants located downstream from&#13;
discharge areas, should be studied and carried out before the main project is implemented.&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
7.          The last two decades have witnessed major urbanization, followed by a wave of&#13;
industrial and tourism development that threatens the natural environment due to the effluents&#13;
produced, which represent a growing source of pollution in terms of both quality and quantity.&#13;
8.          The volume of potable water distributed, and from which the effluents originate, is&#13;
230 Mm3, of which more than 100 Mm3 is currently treated at treatment plants near major urban&#13;
areas and tourist sites in order to protect the environment.&#13;
9.          In view of the growing scarcity of water resources in relation to increased&#13;
agricultural requirements in particular, and given the arid climate, irregular rainfall pattems and&#13;
increasing pressures on groundwater resources, the development of treated waste water for&#13;
agricultural purposes is considered to be a critical component of the integrated water resources&#13;
management policy.&#13;
REUSE OF TREATED WASTE WATER: THE TUNISIAN EXPERIENCE&#13;
Level of Development&#13;
10.         Since 1965, waste water treated at the Charguia plant has been used for the&#13;
Soukra irrigation scheme, covering 1200 ha north of Tunis (now reduced to 600 ha as a result of&#13;
urbanization), in order to safeguard the citrus orchards traditionally irrigated from the over-&#13;
exploited aquifer.&#13;
11.         Since the 1 980s, the Government of Tunisia has focused heavily on the reuse of&#13;
treated waste water, both to protect the existing productive potential (i.e. citrus from Cap Bon -&#13;
Oued Souhil) and to develop new irrigation schemes.&#13;
12.         Existing irrigation schemes cover some 6,500 ha, mostly (55%) in the area&#13;
surrounding Tunis. These schemes draw on an exploitable quantity of 35 Mm3.&#13;
13.         However, the reuse of treated waste water in irrigation schemes runs into certain&#13;
problems in terms of psychological acceptance, agronomic considerations and sanitation, which&#13;
tend to limit its full development (to 15 to 18%) despite the significant presence of fertilizing&#13;
substances in such waste water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-131-&#13;
ANNEX 14&#13;
Page 3 of 11&#13;
14.          Using treated waste water under restrictive conditions that limit farmer incomes is&#13;
one constraint to the development of irrigation schemes.&#13;
15.         Rejection of development is most evident in cases where the irrigation areas are&#13;
new (i.e. with no tradition of irrigation) or were originally designed for vegetable crops.&#13;
16.          Accordingly, intensification rates are highest for citrus growing schemes, which&#13;
involve highly yield crops, whereas they are below 35% for other irrigation schemes. Of the&#13;
latter, the Sfax schemes are an exception because they are largely state-held (El Hajeb irrigation&#13;
scheme).&#13;
17.          Apart from user reluctance stemming from the above-mentioned constraints,&#13;
irrigation schemes that use treated waste water have encountered other problems of various sorts:&#13;
project design, land reform, new system of production, maintenance, extension, etc. In a certain&#13;
number of cases, the problems cannot be attributed to the use of treated waste water and are in&#13;
fact found in new irrigation schemes that use conventional water sources.&#13;
Research&#13;
18.         Progress has been made regarding the reuse of treated waste water in Tunisia, and&#13;
significant research results have been obtained. However, constraints related to the properties of&#13;
the treated waste water have not yet been fully addressed.&#13;
19.          The results obtained by CRGR since the 1980s relate in particular to the physico-&#13;
chemical and bacteriological composition of treated waste water and residual sludge, as well as&#13;
their effect on soils and plant life. An evaluation of their significance as a fertilizer and as a&#13;
pollutant has also been performed.&#13;
20.          But studies on reusing treated waste water and sludge need to be pursued in order&#13;
to evaluate the long-term effects on the soil-plant-aquifer system of various irrigation techniques.&#13;
21.          Another use for treated waste water has also been shown to hold promise: the&#13;
artificial recharging of aquifers when hydrogeological conditions are favorable (DRE project in&#13;
Oued Souhil - Nabeul). This operation offers the advantage of additional purification of waste&#13;
water due to a process of filtration through unsaturated soil. Sanitary precautions must, however,&#13;
be taken if water from the aquifer is used for human consumption. Research on this subject&#13;
should be pursued in different types of terrain.&#13;
Legislation&#13;
22.         In Tunisia, a variety of statutes and laws have been enacted to regulate the disposal&#13;
and use of treated waste water:&#13;

- Two Tunisian standards: one established in order to regulate the quality of water&#13;
released into the environment (Tunisian Standard 106-002 of July 20, 1989) and one concerning&#13;
the use of treated waste water in agriculture (Tunisian Standard 106-003 of May 18, 1989). The&#13;
water quality standards are based on various FAO and WHO recommendations.&#13;
- The Order (Arr&amp;e) of the Minister of Agriculture of June 21, 1994, establishing the list&#13;
of crops that can be irrigated with treated waste water.&#13;
- The Order (Arrete) prescribed by Decree 89-1047 concerning specifications regulating&#13;
the use of treated waste water, issued on September 28, 1995.&#13;
- Law No. 96-41 of June 10, 1996, concerning the control, collection, transport, treatment&#13;
and elimination of solid and liquid waste.&#13;
Institutional and Organizational Structure&#13;
23.          A variety of ministries and entities are responsible for collecting waste water and&#13;
recycling waste water for agriculture:&#13;
- The Office National d'Assainissement (ONAS) is responsible for waste water collection,&#13;
treatment and disposal. The mission of this institution is to study and implement urban sanitation&#13;
projects and then operate them.&#13;
- The Ministry of Agriculture, through its central and regional units (CRDA), is&#13;
responsible for implementing irrigation development projects, operating and maintaining the&#13;
facilities and equipment, distributing water to irrigators and monitoring the health of personnel&#13;
involved in distributing and monitoring water. A few users' associations (AICs) have been&#13;
created to handle water distribution (e.g. in Monastir).&#13;
- The respective missions of the Ministry of Public Health and the Ministry of the&#13;
Environment (oversees the ONAS activities) are to provide health and environmental controls in&#13;
accordance with the applicable regulations.&#13;
24.          The possibility of working through AICs to involve farmers in health monitoring&#13;
should be explored. In addition, as the number of irrigation schemes increases, the need for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-133-&#13;
ANNEX 14&#13;
Page 5 of 11&#13;
coordination among the various stakeholders has grown more and more evident. For this&#13;
purpose, regional monitoring committees have been set up with representatives from the various&#13;
organizations (CRDA, ONAS, Ministry of Health, etc.) in order to ensure broader consultation&#13;
whenever a new irrigation scheme is developed. Nevertheless, there is a need to ensure structural&#13;
coordination at the national level and stimulate the regional committees in order to more&#13;
effectively involve the various partners in the creation and management of irrigation schemes.&#13;
Water Supply and Quality&#13;
25.          Very large daily and seasonal variations have been observed in water supply and&#13;
agricultural requirements as a function of climatic conditions and cropping patterns followed by&#13;
farmers. Solutions for managing the discrepancy between supply and demand should therefore be&#13;
identified to cover all situations: occasional release into the environment versus artificial&#13;
recharging to store significant quantities underground versus the identification of economical dam&#13;
sites for surface accumulation. It has not yet been possible to put the latter alternative into&#13;
practice. The major waste water treatment plants are located in the coastal regions, where there&#13;
is a lack of favorable sites for developing such dams. However, establishing waste water&#13;
treatment plants upstream from urban centers may, in the future, shorten the distance between&#13;
waste water treatment plants and storage or consumption sites.&#13;
26.          The quality of the treated waste water furnished to irrigation schemes is often&#13;
problematical. Continuous monitoring by the distribution agencies (CRDA) has not uncovered&#13;
any microbiological or parasitological risks, but the physico-chemical profile presents certain&#13;
deficiencies:&#13;
- variable color and odor over time (causing a psychological effect and rejection by users);&#13;
- a sometimes high rate of suspended matter (due to premature wear and tear of hydro-&#13;
mechanical equipment in irrigation networks, as well as deposits in tanks);&#13;
- the excessive salinity of some treated waste water (which has an impact on soils and crop&#13;
yields).&#13;
Health Aspects&#13;
27.          The public health service provides health monitoring and disease control.&#13;
Nevertheless, a lack of health coverage for irrigators handling treated waste water has been&#13;
observed. They do not systematically receive health education concerning the risks they incur,&#13;
nor do they adopt the preventive measures that are advocated (periodic physical exams,&#13;
vaccination, etc.).&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 14&#13;

STRATEGY FOR REUSING TREATED WASTE WATER&#13;
Potential Use&#13;
28. 3        It is projected that tlhe annual availability of treated waste water will reach 200&#13;
Mm by the year 2000 and 300 Mm by 2010. The irrigable potential is estimated at nearly&#13;
20.000 ha based on the current level of treatment, the chemical properties of the water (salinity)&#13;
and the laws currently in effect, which do not allow the reuse of all treated waste water.&#13;
29.          Potential use may increase in the long run as the level of treatment is improved,&#13;
whether directly for irrigation purposes or to recharge aquifers or develop surface storage&#13;
interseasonal use. In addition, an irrigation system that avoids all contact with the actual fruit&#13;
could lead to fewer restrictions on crops that are irrigated with such water. Looking beyond the&#13;
year 2000, if the above-mentioned improvements are made and assuming that irrigable land is&#13;
available in the vicinity of waste water treatment plants (i.e. the economic aspect), then it would&#13;
be possible to reuse as much as 60% of treated waste water.&#13;
30.         During the period of the eighth economic and social development plan, there was a&#13;
hiatus in the development of irrigation schemes. Two statutes regulating such activity were&#13;
enacted at this time: bid documents establishing the particular procedures and conditions that&#13;
apply to the use of treated waste water for agricultural purposes (Order of September 28, 1995)&#13;
and the Order of the Minister of Agriculture of June 21, 1994 establishing the list of crops that&#13;
can be irrigated with treated waste water.&#13;
31.         Following the filling of the legislative gaps concerning the reuse of treated waste&#13;
water, the Ministry of Agriculture, aware of the significant hydraulic potential at stake, is planning&#13;
to develop 2000 ha in the near future, in the form of new or expanded irrigation schemes covering&#13;
small areas (60 to 310 ha). Thus, potential irrigation projects now being studied throughout the&#13;
various regions of the country take several criteria into account: dimensions of irrigation&#13;
schemes, irrigation techniques (sprinkling versus gravity-feed), choice of crops (trees, forage,&#13;
cereals, industrial crops), size of farms, operating conditions, extension, monitoring, etc.&#13;
32.          The specific problems encountered in existing irrigation schemes are not&#13;
insurmountable and technical solutions to these problems remain possible (additional&#13;
improvements, rehabilitation of facilities and equipment, preventive maintenance, etc.). Although&#13;
agricultural development ultimately depends on the beneficiaries of such development, for a&#13;
certain time, the state will be required to play the role of catalyst, for example through a&#13;
differential fee scale for water used to irrigate crops, investment incentives, intensive extension&#13;
efforts, free health coverage, etc.&#13;
Elements of the Strategy&#13;
33.          To develop a strategy for the reuse of treated waste water, Tunisia has relied on its&#13;
own experience at the Soukra irrigation scheme in Tunis area and the results of the CRGR&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-135-&#13;
ANNEX 14&#13;
Page 7 of 11&#13;
research, as well as the experience of certain other countries (Australia, Mexico) and the expertise&#13;
of international organizations (WHO, FAO, IBRD).&#13;
34.          The strategy is based on developing a model adapted to the specific conditions of&#13;
the country. This model, which will make it possible to greatly expand the reuse of treated waste&#13;
water in the future under totally safe conditions, will address the following major elements:&#13;
- Irrigation schemes of manageable size should constitute a priority in areas of scant water&#13;
resources in order to safeguard existing schemes that are encountering excessive pressures on&#13;
conventional resources.&#13;
- Given the discrepancy between supply and demand and in view of the slow rate of&#13;
development, recycling waste water for agricultural purposes cannot in and of itself constitute a&#13;
miracle cure for absorbing all waste water as presently treated. Recourse to tertiary treatment&#13;
would probably be the best solution for agriculture over the long run, provided that the physico-&#13;
chemical properties of the treated waste water remain appropriate for profitable irrigation.&#13;
- Studies of projects to reuse treated waste water must address all aspects (technical,&#13;
social and environmental) to avoid all possible risks of contamination and pollution.&#13;
- With respect to the environment, large-scale projects (such as Tunis West) warrant a&#13;
thorough examination of the average surface area of operating entities, the type of developments&#13;
to be advocated (storage basins, lakes, recharging of aquifers) and the most appropriate method&#13;
of irrigation, which depends on the type of infrastructure adjoining the scheme (housing, surface&#13;
wells, roads, etc.).&#13;
- In addition, it is important that improvements in transport, storage and maturation&#13;
facilities and the disposal of treated effluents not have a negative impact on the natural productive&#13;
environment of the region. Compensatory improvements that prove necessary, for example&#13;
nearby urban and industrial zone waste water treatment plants, should be studied and carried out&#13;
before the main project is implemented (e.g. the Mornaguia treatment plant in the case of Tunis&#13;
West).&#13;
- Organizational and institutional elements also need to be strengthened in light of the&#13;
deficiencies observed (monitoring, coordination among stakeholders, etc.).&#13;
- There is a growing need to elicit the participation of irrigation beneficiaries through&#13;
educational outreach, extension work and the training of user associations, from the project&#13;
identification phase forward.&#13;
- Standards and laws need to be carefully observed through widespread circulation of&#13;
information among all stakeholders (e.g. the results of physico-chemical and bacteriological&#13;
monitoring), such that necessary measures can be taken in a timely fashion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-136-&#13;
ANNEX 14&#13;
Page 8 of II&#13;
- The necessary material, human and financial resources must be assembled to implement&#13;
the specified preventive measures (monitoring, vaccination, etc.).&#13;
In light of the fact that the use of treated waste water in agriculture is an important tool for&#13;
stemming the increasing shortage of resources in certain regions, major efforts are still required at&#13;
all levels to meet actual needs.&#13;
THE USE OF TREATED WASTE WATER FROM THE TUNIS WEST WASTE WATER&#13;
TREATMENT PLANT&#13;
35.         The daily output of the Tunis West Treatment Plant is 59,000 cubic meters per day&#13;
during a peak month, i.e. 1.77 Mm3/month. Assuming 60% use of available volume, the&#13;
maximum irrigable area (based on an average requirement of 3 mm/day) is 1200 ha.&#13;
PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS&#13;
Maturation Basin&#13;
36.         The primary reason to develop maturation basins is to improve the bacteriological&#13;
properties of treated effluents, whether intended for agricultural purposes or to recharge aquifers.&#13;
The level of suspended matter would also be reduced. The basin would flood 50 ha at a depth of&#13;
I to 1.5 mn, with a retention period of 17 days. Possible proliferation of algae is however a&#13;
concern. The maturation basin is needed because effluents that are released could pollute runoff&#13;
in the region and could be used for unauthorized agricultural purposes by those residing along&#13;
watercourses. Responsibility for the maturation basin would lie with ONAS.&#13;
Storage Basin&#13;
37.         A storage basin is desirable to provide the flexibility of postponing the reuse of&#13;
treated waste water for agricultural purposes from one season to the next. The length of storage&#13;
for effluents would probably range from 3 to 6 months. The surface area depends on the&#13;
topography of the land and the length of storage. As an example, the basin might be bound by&#13;
hills or hillocks and cover 170 ha at an average depth of 5 mn, i.e. a storage capability of 8.5 Mm3&#13;
assuming a length of storage of 100 days. The environmental impact of such a major reserve of&#13;
marginal water would of course have to be carefully studied.&#13;
Location of Irrigation Scheme&#13;
38.         Two potentially irrigable areas have been studied:&#13;
- an upstream portion of the Medjerda catch basin, located in the western El Attar area;&#13;
- the Mornag area, located within the Oued Meliane catch basin.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-137-&#13;
ANNEX 14&#13;
Page 9 of 11&#13;
The possibility of recharging the aquifers has not been pursued, pending the results of research&#13;
now being conducted on treated waste water from the Sud Meliane treatment plant.&#13;
Treated Effluent Disposal Areas&#13;
39.         The possible locations for discharging effluents from the Tunis West treatment&#13;
plant are:&#13;
- into Oued El Attar, connecting to Oued Medjerda via Oued Chaffrou;&#13;
- directly into Sebkha Sejoumi;&#13;
- into Oued Meliane through a delivery pipe. In this case the water would enter the Gulf&#13;
of Tunis at a distance of 4 km from the discharge area.&#13;
PRECAUTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
40.         The various options for reusing and discharging waste water all have significant&#13;
environmental consequences over the long run. However, precautions can be taken to minimize&#13;
any possible negative effects. Solutions that call for disposal into Oued Chaffrou or Sebkha&#13;
Sejoumi require further study in view of the following considerations:&#13;
- Sebkha Sejoumi is a closed body of water and would require major drainage facilities to&#13;
avoid disturbing its natural balance (drainage toward the Gulf of Tunis through a tunnel);&#13;
- similarly, disposal of water from the maturation basin into Oued El Attar, connecting to&#13;
Oued Medjerda via Oued ChaffTou, poses a potential danger of pollution because of the multiple&#13;
uses of the Medjerda (potable water, irrigation perimeter schemes, individual pumping, etc.) and&#13;
there is no way to eliminate the risks of an operational failure or of overloading the waste water&#13;
treatment plant, or to dilute toxic, uncontrolled discharges in Oued Chaffrou that would ultimately&#13;
reach the Medjerda.&#13;
41.         Accordingly, the Ministry of Agriculture favors a more thorough examination of&#13;
the following solutions:&#13;
- discharging effluents into Oued Meliane, which is a marginal watercourse in comparison&#13;
to Oued Medjerda (this option has been retained for the project);&#13;
- possible use of the Bir M'cherga reservoir on Oued Meliane to dispose of treated&#13;
effluents and mix them with water impounded by the dam for irrigation;&#13;
- exploration of the Mohammedia area for the potential use of effluents for agricultural&#13;
purposes; here again, the outlet for treated waste water would be toward Oued Meliane.&#13;

2.2   Optimization of use of the "equipment fleet"&#13;
To this end, ONAS proposes to:&#13;
* ensure preventive and systematic maintenance of rolling stock;&#13;
* minimize breakdown idle times;&#13;
* improve maintenance workshop management.&#13;
2.3   Control of electric power consumption&#13;
ONAS will focus on better control of electric power, particularly for operation of the&#13;
pumping and WWTPs.&#13;
ONAS will adopt a plan of action designed to:&#13;
* provide a better choice of the type of electric power contract (time or flat-rate tariff);&#13;
* optimize the functioning of WWTP ventilators, pumping stations and other equipments;&#13;
* reduce the penalties incurred for exceeding subscribed capacity and/or lowering the cosine&#13;
below the coefficient 0.8, which represents the penalty threshold&#13;
In collaboration with the Energy Control Agency (Agence de Maitrise d'Energie), ONAS&#13;
will draw up a program of optimization of electric power use in WWTPs and utilization of the&#13;
biogas generated by them. The average energy output of the treatment stations (kWh/kg DBO5&#13;
eliminated) will have to be held at or below 0.8.&#13;

            Tunisia - Greater Tunis Sewerage and Reuse Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Greater Tunis Sewerage and Reuse
            Project will assist the government in (a) improving service
            levels of urban sewerage up to the average level of potable
            water service; (b) promoting efficient reuse of effluent
            from sewerage treatment plants for agricultural purposes;
            (c) reducing urban and coastal pollution; (d) improving cost
            recovery and financial capacity of the national agency in
            charge of sewerage management (ONAS); (e) introducing
            appropriate new sewage treatment technology; (f) providing
            technical assistance to develop private sector participation
            in the sewerage sector; and (g) acquiring environmental
            monitoring and management equipment and tools, and studies.
            There are two components. The urban sewerage for ONAS
            component includes: (1) extending and rehabilitating the
            Tunis South wastewater treatment plant (WWTP); (2)
            restructuring the western Tunis sewerage collection system;
            (3) strengthening the southern Tunis sewage collection
            system and connecting villages to the WWTP; (4) extending
            the Northern Tunis sewage collection system and constructing
            a liaison conduit; and (5) extending, rehabilitating, and
            resizing the sewage collection networks of Central and
            Northern Tunis; (6) strengthening all secondary  sewer
            systems; (7) building pumping systems; (8) acquiring
            miscellaneous sewer maintenance and management equipment;
            and (9) technical assistance, studies, and research work.
            The second component, the agricultural component for the
            Ministry of Agriculture, includes: (1) building a
            multi-seasonal storage basin with a capacity of one to two
            million cubic meters in the El Attar valley; (2) equipping
            an area of 1,000 ha to be irrigated with treated sewage; and
            (3) carrying out a pilot project for groundwater recharge
            with tertiary treated purified sewage.
