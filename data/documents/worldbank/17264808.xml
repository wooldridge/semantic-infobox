        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This note reviews the literature on the
            effects of reforms improving trade logistics systems and
            services. Three key insights emerge. First, trade logistics
            reforms have a notable effect on the ability of countries to
            export and import cost-effectively and to become effective
            players in competitive global and regional markets. Second,
            trade facilitation enhances the productivity of firms. And
            third, targeted reforms can enable firms to use scarce
            working capital more effectively by allowing leaner
            inventories, lowering the carrying charges in transit and
            storage, and reducing pilferage and damage. The literature
            on the effect of reforms in trade logistics systems and
            services provides evidence that improving the policy,
            regulatory, and procedural environment for trade supports
            the development and operation of lean, efficient supply
            chains, helps boost the competitiveness of developing
            economies, and increases export potential.
