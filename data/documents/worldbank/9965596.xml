research also led to further questions,&#13;
some of which relate to schools that&#13;
do not have the type of facilities we&#13;
saw in the Dakar schools. Here are&#13;
some of the questions, along with our&#13;
recommendations for further action:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Is there any point in organizing&#13;
   hygiene activities when 50 percent&#13;
   of schools do not have toilets and&#13;
   are situated in rural areas? Our&#13;
   results suggest that plenty can&#13;
   be done about hygiene both in&#13;
   schools with and without toilets and&#13;
   in areas where mass media may&#13;
   not be available. School hygiene&#13;
   and sanitation promotion can help&#13;
   create demand for facilities from&#13;
   concerned communities. Current&#13;
   investment, such as loans for water&#13;
   and sanitation from the World Bank,&#13;
   should have an earmarked fund to&#13;
   respond to parent/school demand&#13;
                                          The classroom is often the most important social unit after the family&#13;
   for toilets and hand-washing&#13;
   facilities.&#13;
                                          4. While we advocate the use of mass                   6. Formative research methods need&#13;
                                              media as well as school activities                       further development. While our&#13;
2. While hand-washing requires a lot of       in Senegal, we do not know the                           approach provided rich seams of&#13;

            Can hygiene be cool and fun? Insights from
            school children in Senegal
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This field note summarizes formative
            research that looked at motivating factors underlying the
            behavior of Senegalese primary school children.
            Specifically, the research looked at what motivates children
            in this age group to adopt hygienic hand-washing and toilet
            practices, and how this understanding can inform the design
            of simple yet effective sanitation and hygiene programs in
            schools. Whilst school sanitation and hygiene programs have
            existed for a long time, there has been no common route to
            designing programs that have a lasting impact on hygiene
            behavior both for children and their homes. To develop
            communication programs targeted at primary school children,
            the first step was to gain a better general understanding of
            this age group, their habits, their motivations and their
            world. Innovative tools were used to gather insights from
            children, and for once, children's voices on sanitation
            and hygiene were heard. The researchers discovered some of
            the children's reasons for not doing what adults expect
            of them.
