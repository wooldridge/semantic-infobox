Success Story in Kerala&#13;

Local Governments and User&#13;
Groups Plan and Implement&#13;
Large Water Supply Schemes&#13;
&#13;
Three large, river-based schemes in Aliparamba in the north of Kerala, India, are the first of their kind in&#13;
the state to have been planned and implemented by the local governments (or Gram Panchayat) and&#13;
User Groups, and to institute a management model based on Scheme Level Committees. This field note&#13;
analyzes the evolution of these successful schemes.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Many existing rural water supply schemes in Kerala do not meet the demand&#13;
and aspirations of users in terms of adequacy of quantity, quality or reliability&#13;
of service.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Board.3 A key issue underlying this&#13;
&#13;
situation is that community consultation&#13;
&#13;
and participation in the planning and&#13;
&#13;
implementation of these schemes&#13;
by the Kerala Water Authority is very&#13;
&#13;
low. As a consequence, Kerala Water&#13;
&#13;
Authority schemes overlook the fact&#13;
&#13;
that private wells are traditionally used&#13;
&#13;
as the primary source of drinking water&#13;
(by about 80 percent of the population4),&#13;
and that piped water is a viable option&#13;
&#13;
only if it means a higher level of service&#13;
&#13;
in the form of a private household&#13;
&#13;
connection and a reliable supply of good&#13;
&#13;
quality water is provided.&#13;
&#13;
In 1999, in response to this situation&#13;
and with assistance from the World&#13;
                                                            In the initial stages of this project, the   community mobilization process&#13;

decided to pilot a new decentralized&#13;

   This represents an opportunity in Kerala to advocate for a more nuanced&#13;

Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
The initial start-up period has thrown&#13;
up new challenges that the Kerala Rural&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation Agency&#13;
intends to proactively address. These&#13;
include the need for:&#13;
&#13;
·      Providing for future renewal and&#13;
      replacement costs, and expansions.&#13;
&#13;
·      Maintaining stocks of essential&#13;
      spares.&#13;
&#13;
·      Introducing consumer meters to&#13;
      ensure equitable distribution&#13;
      to users.&#13;
&#13;
·      Simplifying recordkeeping and&#13;
      accounting practices.10&#13;
&#13;
·      Building capability of the Scheme&#13;
      Level Committee executive&#13;
      committee to plan, in particular with&#13;
      respect to future financing, access&#13;
      to professional skills after project&#13;
      closure, and operational&#13;
      performance monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
·      Strengthening monitoring, regulatory,&#13;
      audit, and reporting requirements.&#13;
&#13;
Most important, there is a need to                             support from local government and        with necessary funds and skills. This&#13;
&#13;

            Success story in Kerala : local governments
            and user groups plan and implement large water supply schemes
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This field note documents the evolution
            of three large, river-based schemes in Aliparamba Gram
            Panchayat1 near Kozhikode in the north of Kerala state,
            India. This success story is significant because the schemes
            are the first of their kind in Kerala to have been planned
            and implemented by the Gram Panchayat and user groups, and
            to institute a management model that invests ownership and
            corporate oversight with a scheme level committee
            representing participating user groups, that is overseen by
            a Gram Panchayat-level coordination committee. The schemes,
            which are providing potable water to 3,532 families in an
            area where 90 percent of open wells run dry from February to
            May each year, serve as a model for effective, decentralized
            planning and implementation. Many innovations were required
            to address social, technical, institutional, and financial
            issues. These are documented here, and provide valuable
            lessons to policymakers and practitioners in scaling-up such approaches.
