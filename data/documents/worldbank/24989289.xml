(3) Participating countries, and&#13;
(4) Global partners.&#13;
1. Steering Committee&#13;
The GPSA Steering Committee (SC) will initially have 10 members: compromising of the&#13;
following:&#13;
* Three donor agencies (two government bilateral agencies and one private&#13;
foundation/donor);&#13;
* Three CSOs (one from a "part-I" country and two from "part-Il" countries); and&#13;
* Three representatives from developing country governments.&#13;
The SC will be chaired by a WBI. In addition, the Program Manager of the Secretariat will join the&#13;
SC in an observer capacity to serve as a resource person and to facilitate timely implementation&#13;
and follow-up of SC decisions. To balance continuity with rotated membership, participation in the&#13;
SC will be on the basis of fixed three-year terms, which will be staggered after the first three-year&#13;
period. The SC may expand its representation provided it maintains a numerical balance of&#13;
members from all three groups.&#13;
Steering Committee Roles and Responsibilities:&#13;

&gt; Help identify qualified individuals to integrate the Global Roster of Experts (RoE)&#13;
&gt;  Contribute to the development and implementation of a GPSA resource mobilization&#13;
strategy.&#13;
Decisions by the SC will be made by consensus. SC formal (face-to-face) sessions require a quorum&#13;
of at least six people. Decisions may be made through electronic means between face-to-face&#13;
meetings on a no-objection basis involving all members of the SC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-7-&#13;
The SC will meet in person twice a year or more often if necessary. SC meeting locations and dates&#13;
will be proposed by the Secretariat and agreed by the SC.&#13;
2. GPSA Secretariat&#13;
A Secretariat housed in the World Bank has the responsibility to manage the funding, networking,&#13;
communications, reporting and administrative tasks of the GPSA as well as the overall&#13;
management of the GPSA, including coordination, administration and grant-making functions:&#13;
&gt;  Grant-making functions include:(a) Manage the overall grant application and selection&#13;
process, and coordinate the supervision of grant projects with the Bank's Country&#13;

each country's priorities; (c) Prepare ToRs and select the Roster of Experts and&#13;

review by the Roster of Experts and submit them to the SC for approval on a non-&#13;

potential grantees in the introduction of changes to their proposals, based on the&#13;
feedback provided by experts, government officials, the public and the findings of the&#13;
Bank fiduciary assessment of each individual proposal.&#13;
*  Roster of Experts. The Secretariat will establish a global Roster of Experts (RoE) in order&#13;
to bring expert advice into the selection of proposals. The RoE will consist of a list of&#13;
individuals with strong knowledge of social accountability approaches and a sound&#13;
understanding of the realities of the participating countries.&#13;
*  All grants shall be made subject to the decision of the Secretariat to submit, along with&#13;
any peer review comments, for no objection by the GPSA Steering Committee, and&#13;

with the Bank's relevant policies and procedures.&#13;

The GPSA will operate in countries whose governments have "opted-in" to the program, and World&#13;
Bank Country Directors will consult with their respective governments and will submit an "Opt-&#13;
In" letter of consent signed by the government to the GPSA Secretariat.&#13;
Governments will be provided each grant proposal for their review for a period of 10-days.&#13;
