THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;
                                                               Region: OECD high income&#13;

regulations applying to domestic small to medium-size          Income category: High income&#13;
businesses through their life cycle. Economies are ranked&#13;
from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 23,490,736&#13;
Doing Business presents results for 2 aggregate measures:&#13;
the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 64,680&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 13&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 12*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;

The ease of doing business ranking compares economies&#13;
with one another; the distance to frontier score               DB 2015 DTF: 80.09&#13;

absolute terms, while the ease of doing business ranking       and the changes in methodology. See the data notes&#13;
can show only how much the regulatory environment has          starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such&#13;
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the&#13;
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economyâ&#128;&#153;s name&#13;
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business&#13;

      This procedure is required under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936&#13;
      and the New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act of 1999.&#13;
&#13;
      Depending on the company's circumstances and location, it must&#13;
      comply with different taxation requirements:&#13;
&#13;
      - If the annual company turnover is AUD$75,000 or more, the company&#13;
      must register for Goods and Services Tax (GST) by obtaining an 11-digit&#13;
      Australian Business Number (ABN). The annual company turnover&#13;
      represents its gross business income (not its profit). Companies with&#13;
      lower annual turnover may also choose to register for the Goods and&#13;
      Services Tax.&#13;
&#13;
      - The application to ABN can be submitted electronically at the Business&#13;
      Entry Point, www.abr.gov.au. If the electronic submission is successful,&#13;
      the applicant will be provided with an ABN at the end of the Internet&#13;
      session. Alternatively, a hard copy application may be submitted to the&#13;
      ATO. The ATO will then mail the ABN within 28 days of receiving the&#13;
      application.                                                             Less than one day&#13;

      -The company must deduct taxes from employee pay, provide payment&#13;
      summaries, contribute to employee superannuation and report and&#13;
      issue payments to the ATO. Companies may also register for Pay As&#13;
      You Go (PAYG) at www.abr.gov.au. Otherwise, they may register with&#13;
      the ATO by postal mail or phone or through a tax agent. State and&#13;
      territory taxes (e.g., stamp duty, payroll tax, and land tax) may also be&#13;
      imposed, with requirements differing according to company location.&#13;
&#13;
      - Companies with annual turnover of AUD$75,000 or more must&#13;
      register for an ABN. Failure to do so will result in GST being levied on&#13;
      all company sales since the required date of registration even if the sale&#13;
      price of any goods or services has not been grossed up to include the&#13;
      tax. Furthermore, the company may incur penalties and interest charges&#13;
      for any overdue payments.&#13;
&#13;
      - Further information in connection with ABN, GST and PAYG&#13;

        Verify if a development application is required&#13;
&#13;
        It is the responsibility of the applicant to contact a planner at the&#13;
        nearest Council Location before preparing a Development&#13;
        Application (DA), to check:&#13;
        * whether the proposed development is permissible;&#13;
        * whether a DA is required; and&#13;
        * how the City's planning instruments - plans, codes and policies&#13;
        - affect the proposed development.&#13;
&#13;
        BuildCo should ensure that the relevant planning controls have&#13;
        been identified and satisfied.&#13;
&#13;
        There are a range of planning instruments that apply to various&#13;
        types of development and locations within Sydney.&#13;
&#13;
        Most environmental and planning law in Australia varies from&#13;
        one Australian state to another. In Sydney, in the state of New&#13;
   1    South Wales, development will generally be assessed under one               1 day               no charge&#13;
        of the regimes in the Environmental Planning and Assessment&#13;
        Act 1979 (Planning Act).&#13;
&#13;
        The warehouse to be constructed by BuildCo is most likely to fall&#13;
        under Part 4 of the Planning Act and will most likely require&#13;
        development consent from the relevant local council. The&#13;
        Planning Act provides that, for certain types of development, the&#13;
        concurrence of an authority other than the consent authority&#13;
        must be obtained. The conditions for approval of development&#13;
        assessed under Part 4 may also require the developer to obtain&#13;
        further certificates or approvals. These will add cost and time.&#13;
&#13;
        The council's local environment plan (LEP) usually identifies&#13;
        whether development consent is required. The LEP categorizes&#13;
        development as requiring consent, not requiring consent, or&#13;
        prohibited. In most cases, the zoning of the site determines the&#13;
        types of development permitted on the land. Note that the&#13;
        construction of a warehouse is a type of development that&#13;

      almost always requires consent. If the development requires&#13;
      development consent, the local council will usually be the&#13;
      consent authority. However, in some cases, another authority&#13;
      (such as a State minister) may be the consent authority.&#13;

      The consent authority reviews the environmental impact&#13;
      assessment for this proposed work and considers the following:&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Relevant planning controls&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Likely environmental impacts&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Suitability of the site for development&#13;

      â&#128;¢ Other prescribed matters&#13;
      â&#128;¢ The public interest&#13;
&#13;
      If the assessment is satisfactory, the consent authority will grant&#13;
      BuildCo development consent, which may be subject to&#13;
      conditions. The Development Application will be advertised for&#13;
      approximately 21 days to give the surrounding neighbors the&#13;
      opportunity to contest the planned development in that area.&#13;
      Once the advertising period is over, it will typically take 6 weeks&#13;

&#13;
      After a Development Consent has been issued by the Local&#13;
      Council and before any building work is carried out, the owner&#13;
      must apply for a Construction Certificate. This certificate shows&#13;
      that the proposed development satisfies the Environmental&#13;
      Planning and Assessment Regulation 2000.&#13;
&#13;
      This includes:&#13;
      â&#128;¢ The construction plans and specifications must comply with the&#13;
      relevant standards (ie Building Code of Australia).&#13;
      â&#128;¢ The construction plans and specifications are consistent with&#13;
      the development consent; and&#13;

      compliance prior to the issuance of a construction certificate are&#13;
      finalized (i.e., payment of the long service levy has been made,&#13;
      the fire protection and structural capacity of the development is&#13;
      adequate, etc.).&#13;

3&#13;
      private accredited building surveyor. If BuildCo chooses the&#13;
      Council as the PCA, an appointment form must be completed&#13;
      after the Construction Certificate is obtained. BuildCo must&#13;
      confirm with the PCA what work will be done, the fee, and any&#13;
      other requirements.&#13;
&#13;
      When the City of Sydney is the PCA, the developer submits a&#13;

      accordance to Clause 162A of the Environmental Planning and&#13;
      Assessment Regulation 2000) and any other inspections&#13;
      (determined by the PCA) that will be required during&#13;
      construction of the building. The builder needs to be aware of&#13;
      these inspections as they need to be carried out at the&#13;
      appropriate time. It is the responsibility of the builder to contact&#13;
      the PCA at least 48 hours before an inspection is required.&#13;
&#13;
      Inspections during construction ensure that the construction is&#13;
      consistent with what has been approved in the development&#13;
      consent and construction certificate, and that the building will&#13;
      meet acceptable standards of health, safety and amenity.&#13;

        Electrical contractors and ASPs should not proceed with the electrical&#13;
        installation works unless they have received a Job Number. Along with&#13;
        the Job Number, the utility will notify the customer that a Site&#13;
        Establishment fee applies (in our case, a site establishment fee will apply,&#13;
        because it is a new installation and will require a National Metering&#13;
        Identifier (NMI)). The utility also augments its network as the connection&#13;
        is 150 meters (this time estimate for augmenting network ranges from 30&#13;
        to 50 days).&#13;

The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;

and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff&#13;
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.&#13;

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous&#13;
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost&#13;
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary&#13;
requirements than does the number of documents required.&#13;

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal&#13;
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

the nonlinear transformation, an increase in the total tax&#13;

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it&#13;
would have had before this approach was adopted in&#13;
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in&#13;
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for&#13;
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;
5&#13;
  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;
weights&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for
            Australia. To allow for useful comparison, the profile also
            provides data for other selected economies (comparator
            economies) for each indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the
            13th edition in a series of annual reports measuring the
            regulations that enhance business activity and those that
            constrain it. Economies are ranked on their ease of doing
            business; for 2015 Australia ranks 13. A high ease of doing
            business ranking means the regulatory environment is more
            conducive to the starting and operation of a local firm.
            Doing Business presents quantitative indicators on business
            regulations and the protection of property rights that can
            be compared across 189 economies from Afghanistan to
            Zimbabwe and over time. Doing Business sheds light on how
            easy or difficult it is for a local entrepreneur to open and
            run a small to medium-size business when complying with
            relevant regulations. It measures and tracks changes in
            regulations affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a
            business: starting a business, dealing with construction
            permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
            credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
            across borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency
            and labor market regulation. The data in this report are
            current as of June 1, 2015 (except for the paying taxes
            indicators, which cover the period from January to December 2014).
