This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission which visited Pakistan in July/August 1995. The&#13;
mission comprised Messrs./Mesdames C. Walker (Mission Leader), N. Abbas (Procurement Specialist, SAP&#13;
Multi-Donor Support Unit, Pakistan), M. Siraj ul Haq (Health Planner, Consultant), J. Herm (Management&#13;
Specialist, Consultant), J. Pillai-Essex (Economist, Consultant) and Y. Tayyab (Community Specialist,&#13;
Consultant). Mr. I. Kazmi (Aga Khan Health Services) and Ms. A. Kamal (Socio-Economist, Consultant)&#13;
assisted with specific aspects of project components for NA. Ms. N. Akhlaque (Social Scientist, Consultant)&#13;
and Messrs. M. Mirza (Epidemiologist, Consultant), A. Rehman (Financial Analyst, Consultant) and A.&#13;
Wafa (Health Specialist, Consultant) assisted with specific aspects of project components for AJK.  In&#13;
addition, Mesdames A. Tinker (Senior Health Specialist), K. Finn (Consultant), and Mr. P. Gavras&#13;
(Consultant) contributed substantially during project preparation. The support during project preparation of&#13;
the British Overseas Development Administration, the Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development&#13;
Fund, and the SAP Multi-donor Support Unit is acknowledged. German KfW conducted an independent&#13;
appraisal of the NA component in October 1995. Project processing was supervised by Mesdames M.&#13;
Nishimizu (Director, SAI) and B. Herz (Manager, SAIPH). The peer reviewers for the project were&#13;

Project Description: Pakistan's social indicators are considerably worse than most other comparable&#13;
countries. Northern Pakistan, comprising the Northern Areas (NA) and Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir (AJK),&#13;
is particularly disadvantaged. Nearly four million people live in the two regions scattered over a vast area&#13;
of some of the most rugged terrain in the world. Health status and services are substantially worse than&#13;
the low levels found elsewhere in Pakistan, especially for women and children. Years of neglect and&#13;
eroded budgets have left services in a primitive state. The proposed Credit will finance a long overdue&#13;
boost to capital and recurrent expenditure that will bring services to a minimum level and seek to&#13;
establish strong community and non-governmental (NGO) involvement in decentralized service&#13;
provision. The focus will be on primary health care, supported by obstetric and other emergency referral&#13;
care. Priority will be given to ensuring existing services and facilities are functional; almost no new&#13;

facilities will be built. Pakistan's Social Action Programme (SAP), an important umbrella initiative&#13;
supported by IDA and other donors, is addressing social sector problems nationally. The proposed four&#13;
year project will complement the overarching SAP initiatives by focusing in detail on NA and AJK's&#13;
health sectors. As the project will take a program approach, agreements are necessary between the&#13;
Governments and IDA on the overall sectoral policies, on well developed sectoral programs and&#13;
implementation plans, and on carefully designed monitoring procedures. IDA financing will be on a&#13;
time-slice basis. The project aims to support the Governments in their effort to improve health status&#13;
substantially and in particular to reduce infant and maternal mortality by about 30 percent. The project&#13;
will help the two regions to: (a) improve quality and sustainability of primary health care especially&#13;
through the development of community involvement and NGOs; (b) increase cost-effectiveness and&#13;
coverage of Government health services; (c) strengthen human resources development especially for the&#13;
critical female paramedical staff; and (d) build institutional capacity through better management and&#13;
organizational development.  With the rugged terrain, harsh weather and isolated settlements, a&#13;
community based decentralized approach is central to the project design and the only way to provide&#13;
sustainable services. To ensure organizational and financial sustainability, project components have&#13;
been simplified as far as possible with a careful choice of the most cost-effective interventions. The&#13;
community involvement emphasis would help to ensure sustainability. There will be one major annual&#13;
review to check project progress on implementing the agreed policy and program measures, to ensure&#13;
appropriate financing is available, and to monitor overall project implementation. The project will be&#13;
implemented by the two Departments of Health and by cooperating NGOs and community organizations.&#13;
Benefits and Risks:   The main benefits will be improving the health of this very poor and under-&#13;
served population, with a special emphasis on the needs of women and children who are presently&#13;
particularly disadvantaged.  Economic returns to investments targeted at women are high since&#13;
improvements translate into the lives of those in her charge. It is estimated that by the end of the&#13;
proposed project, over two million women and children will have benefitted from increased access to&#13;
better quality primary health care. The project would lower fertility and hence population growth,&#13;
through improved health status increase individuals' capacity as economic agents, improve health service&#13;
use and cost-effectiveness, strengthen staff skills, and make service provision more efficient.&#13;
The main risk is that the limited implementation capacity of the regions would be further strained by the&#13;
complexity of the program approach and by introducing community involvement. This is addressed&#13;
through including substantial management development and technical support, simplifying project&#13;
components as far as possible, completing detailed preparation well in advance, and working with&#13;
experienced NGOs as partners. A second risk is that the Government would fail in its commitment to&#13;
finance the expanding programs at the agreed levels. The Government's record over the past three years&#13;
in protecting social sector budgets from cuts is good. It has generally complied with its budgetary&#13;
commitments to the social sectors. Failure to implement fully the proposed changes in health policy and&#13;
thereby delay project implementation is a third risk. The program approach design mitigates this risk&#13;
through having approved policy documents, annual agreements on specific reforms, and detailed work&#13;
plans. The close association with SAP and the strengthened role of NGOs and communities provide&#13;
further leverage.  A fourth risk is that essential additional female staff would be unavailable. The&#13;
proposed project includes specific measures to enlist women's organizations to help recruit staff,&#13;
introduce incentives, provide culturally appropriate training and security, introduce incentives, and&#13;
ensure women are posted to their home areas; experience so far is encouraging. Finally, any resurgence&#13;
of ethnic or political strife in these regions would affect project implementation; there is little that can be&#13;
done through the project to reduce such risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iii -&#13;
Poverty Category - Program of targeted interventions: The areas covered by the proposed project are&#13;
particularly poor and under-served. The project is primarily aimed at women and children who suffer&#13;
disproportionately from poverty and preventable disease. Thus it will benefit poor families more than&#13;
others.&#13;

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN&#13;
NORTHERN HEALTH PROGRAM PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. Country and Sector Background&#13;
A. Current Health Situation&#13;
1.    Pakistan's economic performance in the past two decades has been relatively strong, with GDP&#13;
growth averaging nearly 6 percent per year, although it has fallen to an annual average of 3.6 percent since&#13;
1993. The rapid annual population growth of 3 percent has severely restricted per capita consumption gains.&#13;
Many years of neglect of the social sectors have put Pakistan among the group of developing countries with&#13;
the worst social indicators and widest disparity between males and females in health, education, and&#13;
earnings potential. Northern Pakistan, comprising the Northern Areas (NA) and Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir&#13;
(AJK), is particularly disadvantaged and has received a very limited share of Pakistan's increased wealth.&#13;
In these two regions, nearly four million people live scattered over a vast area of exceptionally rugged&#13;
terrain. Poverty is pervasive and access to even the most basic services is extremely limited. Average&#13;
annual per capita income in Pakistan is approximately Rs 10,300, but only about Rs 5,600 in NA and Rs&#13;
7,300 in AJK (1991 prices)1. About three years ago, the Government of Pakistan adopted a Social Action&#13;
Programme (SAP) to begin to redress the neglect of basic social services. With assistance from donors&#13;
including IDA, general support to programs under the SAP umbrella in primary education, primary health,&#13;
family planning, and rural water and sanitation are now underway, as well as discrete investment projects in&#13;
all four of Pakistan's provinces. However, barely any donor assistance for the social sectors, other than&#13;
modest general support through SAP, has reached these two remote regions of NA and AJK.&#13;
2.     The two regions share a similar pattem of disease, which differs somewhat from the national&#13;
picture. Overall health status is lower in NA than in AJK. The incidence of acute respiratory infection&#13;
(ARI) and tuberculosis (TB) is more than in Pakistan's four provinces, while diarrheal diseases are a major&#13;
cause of death in the provinces and the two regions alike. Leprosy, not a problem in the provinces, is still a&#13;
public health problem in both regions -- while for malaria, the position is reversed. Anemia is widespread&#13;
among women of reproductive age in NA and AJK, due to high incidence of intestinal worms and poverty;&#13;
iodine deficiency is endemic (affecting one-third of school children in NA).  Due to primitive&#13;
communications, rugged terrain, and severe weather conditions, emergency cases often cannot reach&#13;
available services. Pakistan's maternal mortality ratio and fertility rate are high, but even worse in NA and&#13;
AJK -- maternal mortality is estimated at 700 deaths per 100,000 live births and fertility is close to seven&#13;
births per woman. Similarly, infant and child mortality, estimated to be 130 and 160 in NA and 90 and 130&#13;
in AJK respectively, are significantly above national levels.&#13;
3.     Health care in NA and AJK is mainly provided by the Government; the role of non-government&#13;
organizations (NGOs) is limited and that of the private commercial sector is very small. Primary health care&#13;
and basic referral services, provided through a hierarchy of Government facilities, are weak and not&#13;
effectively linked to communities. Higher referral service are provided by a few large hospitals in the main&#13;
centers. Total public spending in the two regions for health is Rs 550 million in 1995/96, equivalent to Rs&#13;
162 per capita of which about 57 percent is for primary health (development and recurrent). About 76&#13;
percent of the total program budget is for recurrent expenditure. The Federal Govemment provides&#13;
substantial support to NA and AJK. NA has autonomy to implement programs but is fully dependent&#13;
financially on the Federal Government. The Chief Executive of NA is a member of the Pakistan Cabinet.&#13;
1 Punjab Economic Research Institute, 1992.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
AJK has autonomy in managing its affairs through its Parliament, but the Federal Government provides&#13;
development grants and meets the budgetary deficit. (See also Institutional Assessment, Section III, Part&#13;
B).&#13;
B. Main Sector Issues&#13;
4.     Years of neglect have left the health sector in a very primitive state. The current situation is due&#13;
mainly to substantial deficiency in government budget allocations, especially for non-salary recurrent&#13;
budgets. Overall budgets in NA and AJK have been declining for the past ten years and, as a result, non-&#13;
salary recurrent health expenditure has been squeezed to unacceptably low levels. Rising expenditure on&#13;
secondary health facilities has also led to cuts in primary health care spending (especially in AJK). Many&#13;
existing facilities are functioning without the staff, medicine, equipment and space necessary for basic&#13;
operations. In NA, about one-third of the buildings are 15-25 years old and 85 percent of all buildings have&#13;
never been repaired or renovated. The injection of funds necessary to improve the quality of services would&#13;
raise the public's confidence in the facilities, increase utilization, and make service provision more cost-&#13;
effective. In AJK, given the adverse conditions, the health system is functioning relatively well. The&#13;
strategy, therefore, is to build on the gains made through current efforts to develop the health sector. In both&#13;
regions, the proposed Credit will finance a much needed and long overdue boost to both capital and&#13;
recurrent expenditure that will bring the health services to a minimum level, especially in NA where the&#13;
situation is worse.&#13;
5.     Providing health services to a widely scattered population in rugged, mountainous terrain is&#13;
relatively expensive on a per capita basis. Northern Pakistan is the apex of many of the highest mountain&#13;
ranges in the world. Communications are poor and population density is very low, only about 15 persons&#13;
per square kilometer. With a limited network of functioning health facilities, complications of pregnancy&#13;
and accidents, as well as diseases such as pneumonia and TB, are major killers. Provision of even basic&#13;
primary health and family planning services is significantly more difficult than in the rest of the country.&#13;
The dearth of health services provided by the commercial private sector puts an added burden on&#13;
Government services.  But, the potential pay-off from  providing preventive and basic services is&#13;
correspondingly high.&#13;
6.     The main public health needs -- reproductive and child health services -- are not being effectively&#13;
addressed. Current provision of these services is very limited with little preventive and promotive care,&#13;
almost non-existent outreach services, and poor referral services. In NA, where government services are the&#13;
most deficient, part of the vacuum in primary health service provision has been filled by the Aga Khan&#13;
Health Services (AKHS), an NGO that provides successful community-based services in two districts (20-&#13;
25 percent of the NA population); they rely on the public sector for referral facilities. Limited services are&#13;
also provided by two NGOs: the Family Planning Association of Pakistan (FPAP) and the Marie Adelaide&#13;
Foundation (MAF), which runs a very effective leprosy and TB control program. In AJK, only 15 percent of&#13;
facilities are providing maternal and child health (MCH) services; the rest lack the space, staff, equipment&#13;
and medicines required. FPAP and MAF are also active in AJK.&#13;
7.     Lack of trained staff-- especially female -- is a major problem. Female patients can usually only&#13;
be treated by female health staff. The limited number of female staff, especially Lady Health Visitors&#13;
(LHVs), is a major constraint to improving the health of women and the children under their care. In NA,&#13;
there are 64 LH`Vs working under the auspices of AKHS and only 14 for the government -- or I per 35,000&#13;
people. There are two gynecologists in all of NA. In AJK, the position is only marginally better. At the&#13;
community level, the Government has recently initiated an effort to recruit female staff to provide basic&#13;
health and family planning services and advice through the national Lady Health Workers (LHWs)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
Program. Recruitment and training are underway in both NA and AJK. In both regions, in-service training&#13;
for all categories of staff is inadequate and not practically oriented.&#13;
8.    Institutional and management capacity is limited. Management at the headquarters and district&#13;
level is weak, particularly in NA, and a proper system is needed to coordinate with NGOs and communities.&#13;
In both regions, managers of the Government health services are very few and overworked. The current&#13;
centralized system is not amenable to delivering services in these extreme conditions. In AJK, the current&#13;
dual system of management, with significant military involvement in the provision of health services,&#13;
makes administration inefficient. Furthermore, the staff (predominantly male) and drugs that the military&#13;
provide are mismatched to a program with a strong maternal, child and community-based approach. In both&#13;
regions, management reorganization is also needed to integrate immunization and communicable disease&#13;
control services with other health services. Management information systems are underused and require&#13;
strengthening.&#13;
9.     Community involvement has been limited and needs to be expanded. Given the extremely adverse&#13;
conditions, it is very difficult for any centralized system to function; it is essential that communities are&#13;
involved in the management and provision of their own health care and fostering such participation is&#13;
integral to the proposed project. Genuine community involvement improves service acceptability, cost-&#13;
effectiveness, sustainability and quality of service provision. In NA, the Aga Khan Rural Support Program&#13;
(AKRSP) has been successful in organizing general community involvement, while AJK has only very&#13;
limited and recent community involvement experience.&#13;
C. Sector Strategy&#13;
10.    The Governments' strategies to address the above issues and to develop the sector is articulated in&#13;
the 1995 NA and AJK Health Policy Statements (Annexes 6 and 7). The Statements were drafted and&#13;
formally approved during project preparation. They incorporate a substantial reform agenda and, in contrast&#13;
to earlier health policies, give genuine priority to primary health care and women's health. This is an&#13;
important development; it is the first time that health sector policy for these regions has been documented.&#13;
Similar documents have not generally been prepared elsewhere in Pakistan, nor are existing policies as&#13;
strong in their emphasis on primary health care. The Statements were prepared separately by the twvo&#13;
Governments but propose similar approaches. Recognizing the economic and social benefits that flow from&#13;
improved health status, the overall goal is to improve the health status of the public, particularly mothers&#13;
and children, by 30 percent in the next five years. The strategies are to strengthen the promotive and&#13;
preventive components of health care, improve the quality of basic curative services, improve the overall&#13;
performance of the Departments of Health (DOH) in each region, coordinate planning, management, and&#13;
operations among government agencies, NGOs and communities, and provide more effective federal&#13;
support to health operations and management in the two regions. As part of these strategies, MCH and&#13;
family planning services specifically will be expanded and improved. The strategies call also for a lean but&#13;
effective system of referral facilities, including essential obstetric care, staff development, and a more&#13;
equitable distribution of services among areas. More broadly, the strategies emphasize decentralized&#13;
management, using NGOs to facilitate community involvement in the planning and provision of care, but&#13;
recognize the likely modest role of the private commercial sector. They call for increased total expenditure&#13;
on public health to redress past neglect and resolution of the chronic non-salary recurrent budget problems.&#13;
The strategies emphasize bringing existing facilities up to minimum operating standards through&#13;
investments over a limited time, with very limited construction of new facilities. IDA endorses this focus&#13;
on primary health care, supported by obstetric and other emergency referral care, as well as increased&#13;
involvement of NGOs and the community, as a cost-effective way to address health needs in NA and AJK.&#13;
This approach is consistent with, and supportive of, the overall SAP strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
II. The Project&#13;
A. Program/Project Approach&#13;
11.    A "program" approach will be followed, similar to that adopted in the recent Pakistan SAP2 and&#13;
Population Welfare Program3 Projects. This approach requires an agreement between the Governments and&#13;
IDA on the overall sectoral policies and strategies, including directions for reform, during the next four to&#13;
five years, well developed programs of activities and implementation plans, and carefully designed&#13;
monitoring and evaluation schemes. The proposed project will operate under the umbrella of the national&#13;
SAP, with the detailed project work in each region contributing to the development of the broad SAP annual&#13;
plans. SAP conditionality, financing and disbursements will be complementary to those for the project. The&#13;
program activities, implementation plans, progress indicators, and budgets for NA and AJK, both&#13;
development and recurrent, have been developed within the framework of the Health Policy Statements, and&#13;
have been agreed between the Governments and IDA. Each year, progress made during the previous year&#13;
will be reviewed, and the health sector program for the coming financial year (both in budgetary terms and&#13;
in content, plus the specifics of the reform measures to be implemented) will be defined in detail. IDA&#13;
would need to have seen adequate progress during the previous year, ensure compliance with any&#13;
overarching SAP agreements and approve each annual plan before releasing project funds for that year.&#13;
With this approach, the Governments will have more flexibility in implementing the program than with the&#13;
traditional project approach, but they will be responsible for meeting performance targets in order to receive&#13;
annual funding.&#13;
12.    The program comprises the total activities of the government health sector in NA and AJK plus&#13;
eligible health-related activities with communities and NGOs, for the four years 1996/97 to 1999/2000.&#13;
During project preparation it became clear that there were a number of large approved development&#13;
schemes especially in AJK which could not be accommodated within the projected staffing and financial&#13;
resources for the next four years. These were almost all for hospital development and therefore of a lower&#13;
priority within the new health policies. The Governments agreed to scale down or defer such schemes.&#13;
They also agreed that no new referral facilities would be built without prior consultation with IDA. These&#13;
agreements will be carefully monitored through the annual review process.&#13;
13.    Within the agreed programs, the proposed project comprises all incremental aspects of primary&#13;
health in NA and AJK plus the critical supporting parts of the first referral level of accident, emergency and&#13;
obstetric care. Activities in these areas will be financed on a time-slice basis by IDA while cooperating&#13;
donors will finance conventionally. Details of the project are included in various Government project&#13;
documents, and particularly in the project PC-ls. Development projects in Pakistan must be presented to&#13;
the approving Government authorities in a prescribed detailed format, known as a PC-I.&#13;
14.    The policy agenda for the four years, as included in the two Health Policy Statements, is outlined&#13;
above and represents a very substantial shift toward giving primary health care and especially MCH true&#13;
priority in the allocation of sectoral resources, in taking steps to ensure the availability of trained staff and&#13;
supplies for rural facilities, in developing genuine community and NGO involvement in primary services,&#13;
and in improving and decentralizing management. The details of the policies vary between the two regions&#13;
but key features of each are: (a) NA -- a strong focus on community involvement and ownership, including&#13;
decentralization and community operation of facilities; rapid expansion of the immunization program;&#13;
availability of oral rehydration salts through public and private channels supported by a strong health&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
education program; emphasis on acute respiratory infections; expansion regionwide of female community&#13;
workers; top priority for training and posting of female paramedical staff; and strengthening health&#13;
education and micronutrient programs; (b) AJK -- introduction regionwide of female community workers&#13;
for rural and urban areas; provision of MCH services at all basic facilities; ensuring referral services for&#13;
obstetric emergencies; introduction of an essential drugs list; collection and retention of user fees by&#13;
hospitals; priority for recruiting and training female paramedical staff; establishment of technical and&#13;
managerial in-service training; integration of disease control programs; provision of family planning&#13;
services at all facilities; strengthening nutrition and micronutrient programs; encouraging the development&#13;
of the private commercial sector; and phasing out military support.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
15.   The goal of the proposed project is to support the Governments' programs in NA and AJK to&#13;
improve the health status of the population throughout all districts, with a specific target of reducing infant&#13;
and maternal mortality by about 30 percent over the four years. Achieving this goal would also require&#13;
reduced fertility.  With a targeted, time-limited investment largely to improve existing services, a&#13;
functioning system would be put in place to deliver a minimum set of cost-effective health services.&#13;
Improved health status would result from achieving four objectives: (a) improving quality and sustainability&#13;
of primary health care, including preventive measures, especially through the development of community&#13;
involvement and NGOs; (b) increasing cost-effectiveness and coverage of Government health and family&#13;
planning services, particularly through strengthening nearly 500 DOH health facilities including the basic&#13;
referral level; (c) strengthening the capacity of the health sector through human resources development,&#13;
including training over 600 female staff, and (d) building institutional capacity through better management&#13;
and organizational development.&#13;
16.   Annex 3 presents the operational targets within these four objectives and the performance&#13;
indicators that will be used to monitor progress. Operational targets for the four objectives include: (a)&#13;
increasing village and women's organizations such that the number of facilities with active community&#13;
participation increases by 10 percent per annum; (b) fully staffing and equipping 320 facilities in AJK and&#13;
230 facilities in NA; (c) training 230 LHVs in AJK and 100 in NA, 200 female nursing assistants in AJK&#13;
and 100 in NA and 200 paramedics in AJK and 100 in NA; and (d) providing in-service management&#13;
training to about 150 staff in NA and 650 staff in AJK.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
17.   The proposed project will comprise four main components: (a) strengthening community and NGO&#13;
participation; (b) strengthening Government health services; (c) human resource development; and (d)&#13;
management and organizational development.&#13;
18.   Strengthening Community and NGO Participation (US$12.2 million equivalent estimated base&#13;
cost, 22 percent ofproject cost) Fostering the genuine involvement of communities in their health services&#13;
would be a major contribution towards the combined objectives of improved quality and acceptability of&#13;
services, cost-effectiveness, and sustainable health improvement. To date, community involvement in&#13;
health services has been largely confined to NGO-run activities, particularly in two districts of NA. By its&#13;
nature, the details of this component will evolve during project implementation, but the aim is to introduce&#13;
community participation to most of the regions' existing health services by the end of the project. This&#13;
would be achieved through a combination of: (a) strengthening and expanding existing NGO services; (b)&#13;
adding new NGO services; and (c) introducing community and NGO involvement to existing Government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
services. The personnel of the larger established NGOs will participate as appropriate in the human&#13;
resources and management development project components (see paras. 27 and 29). NGOs are more&#13;
developed in NA than in AJK. In NA, where there is a tradition of NGO-Government cooperation, the&#13;
proposed project will support: (a) strengthening and expanding the successful and pioneering community-&#13;
oriented primary health model of the AKHS in the two districts where it presently operates plus&#13;
experimenting with new initiatives and increasing Government-AKHS cooperation and service&#13;
rationalization in those districts; (b) through the extensive network of AKRSP-developed community and&#13;
women's organizations, introducing community concepts to existing Government primary health services in&#13;
the remaining three districts of NA with technical advice, social mobilization, training and supervision&#13;
provided by AKHS, AKRSP and associated NGOs; and (c) strengthening and expanding the existing and&#13;
effective programs of the FPAP and MAF such that good quality family planning and leprosy/TB&#13;
community-oriented services will be generally available, typically working from Government health&#13;
facilities throughout NA.&#13;
19.   In AJK, where there are long-standing informal partnerships between communities and government&#13;
but few established NGOs, the project will build on these partnerships and support: (a) the establishment of&#13;
an autonomous Social Mobilization Unit (SMU), representing communities, NGOs and the DOH, with&#13;
teams in each district to plan, coordinate, implement, and supervise the introduction of community&#13;
involvement in existing primary health services, which are largely Government-run; and (b) the&#13;
strengthening and expansion of the existing programs of the FPAP and MAF (as in NA). Government has&#13;
formalized involvement of the main NGOs in NA and AJK through a signed memoranda of&#13;
understanding for each.&#13;
20.   While the details will vary depending on locally determined needs, in both NA and AJK it is&#13;
expected that the focus of the community services will be on MCH preventive and curative services&#13;
provided by a paid facility-based LHV supported by a network of community-based workers or LHWs and&#13;
traditional birth attendants (TBAs). Through a system of local and district committees (see "Project&#13;
Implementation" below) communities will help: (a) plan the types and levels of services to be provided; (b)&#13;
manage, supervise, and monitor provision of these services; (c) contribute to service financing (through&#13;
land, buildings, volunteers, or cash as appropriate) and monitor expenditure; and (d) provide feedback to the&#13;
district level. Local groups may be male, female, or mixed depending on local circumstances, but&#13;
coordination between these groups will be important. As has already happened on a small scale in NA, it is&#13;
expected that some local groups would evolve so that they could take over management of their local&#13;
government facilities. Similarly, experience has shown that it is feasible to introduce a system of modest&#13;
fees to recoup part of the medicine and consultation costs provided that the quality of services is&#13;
maintained. Also, the project will experiment with the endowment fund concept (based on the SAP&#13;
Community School Program) to help finance operations and maintenance of health facilities. The local&#13;
adaptation of these financing and delivery models will vary, in accordance with the community's demand&#13;
for health services, ability to pay, and management experience.&#13;
21.   In NA and AJK, the communities will be involved in addressing the problem of insufficient female&#13;
staff. Communities will be asked to nominate TBAs and qualified women for training as LHWs. After&#13;
training, they will be linked to the health facility in their community. Similarly, after training, LHVs will be&#13;
posted to facilities in their home areas and would only be transferred by mutual agreement and after review&#13;
by a senior level committee.&#13;
22.   Finally, to strengthen and support smaller NGOs in building community organizations and&#13;
providing health and family planning services, an NGO fund will be created. The fund will be managed by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
the NGO Program Committee reporting to the overall Program Steering Committee, (see "Project&#13;
Implementation" below) which will be responsible for coordinating all NGO activities in the health sector.&#13;
The proposals for NGO funds will be reviewed, approved and funds disbursed in accordance with the&#13;
criteria and procedures agreed between the Government and the donors. These criteria include: (a) for&#13;
NGOs -- registered for one year, basic management and financial capacity, ability to generate funds, and&#13;
rural community-based; and (b) for projects -- development rather than welfare oriented, partly self-&#13;
financing, replicable, locally oriented, not duplicative, and preferably MCH-focused.&#13;
23.    Strengthening Government Health Services. (US$29.0 million equivalent estimated base cost; 52&#13;
percent of project cost) The objective of the proposed project component is to improve the quality and&#13;
coverage of Government health services, with particular attention to improving and expanding services for&#13;
women and children, through an intensive one-time effort to upgrade existing facilities and services to a&#13;
fully operational but basic level. The focus will be on upgrading and includes posting additional LHVs,&#13;
providing working space, equipment and accommodation where deficiencies exist, and generally&#13;
strengthening MCH and family planning services at health facilities.  Communicable disease control&#13;
programs will be strengthened and integrated more fully with other public health activities. Nutrition advice&#13;
-- and health education generally -- and micronutrient supplements will be included in pre- and post-natal&#13;
care and child health services.&#13;
24.    With respect to infrastructure development, the proposed project will bring all existing primary&#13;
facilities up to a minimum standard by the end of the project period. A detailed mapping exercise will be&#13;
conducted to assess the adequacy of health facilities relative to the population distribution. Primary care&#13;
facilities without MCH service space (165 facilities) will be expanded. For the few cases of new&#13;
construction, land is available for almost all sites and procurement of the balance has been initiated. In&#13;
addition to ensuring that all primary level health facilities are minimally equipped, supplied and&#13;
functioning, the project will provide essential equipment and communications systems to higher level health&#13;
facilities (at the district level and below) in order to strengthen the referral system. At the referral level, the&#13;
emphasis will be on upgrading capacity to treat emergency cases, especially women with pregnancy&#13;
complications, critically ill children and serious accidents. With the rugged terrain, improved transport and&#13;
communications are essential; vehicles, including ambulances and motorcycles, will be provided to&#13;
facilitate emergency transport, supervision, logistical support and outreach.&#13;
25.    Provision of health education will be strengthened through reorganization of the present system and&#13;
through increased activities and training. A position to coordinate health education activities will be created&#13;
in each District Health Office and a local program pursued. Additionally, all levels of health personnel will&#13;
be trained in health education and provided with materials.&#13;
26.    The proposed project will assist in phasing out the military's support to the DOHs. Apart from&#13;
replacing senior and middle level staff as trained civilians become available in NA and AJK, the cost of&#13;
medicines currently being supplied by the military for AJK will be phased into the DOH recurrent budget.&#13;
27.    Human Resource Development.  (US$4.2 million equivalent estimated base cost; 7 percent of&#13;
project cost -- about 40 percentfor pre-service and 60 percentfor in-service training). Under the proposed&#13;
project, pre-service and in-service training will be provided to ensure adequate numbers of appropriately&#13;
trained health personnel and to improve the quality of service delivery at all levels. Emphasis will be placed&#13;
on increasing the number of female providers including LHVs and community-based workers trained in&#13;
MCH and family planning. The development of female staff is crucial to meeting the objective of&#13;
expanding access to and quality of essential health care for women and children. A training plan has been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
developed for each region, which includes measures to ensure the availability of trainers and trainees. For&#13;
trainees, such measures include helping with basic education requirements, ensuring security, close liaison&#13;
with parents, a generous stipend, and ensuring non-transferable employment in their home area. While&#13;
Government requirements predominate, all training will be a joint NGO-Govemment undertaking,&#13;
especially in NA. To address the shortage of female staff in NA and ensure their availability over the&#13;
longer term, the present School of Midwifery will be upgraded and redesignated as a Public Health School.&#13;
It will be the only such training school in NA and will train 100 LHVs during the project. In AJK, existing&#13;
schools for pre-service training of LHVs and nurses will be strengthened and 230 LHVs and 80 nurses will&#13;
be trained. Total staff is expected to increase at about 4.5 percent per year until the year 2000 in NA and 1&#13;
to 1.5 percent per year in AJK, with the number of LHVs expected to grow faster than any other cadre.&#13;
Since TBAs perform most deliveries, they will also be trained; trainees will be selected by the local village&#13;
or women's organizations.&#13;
28.   Three small Regional Training Centres in AJK and two in NA will be established to provide&#13;
systematic in-service training, linked with supportive field supervision, in both technical and managerial&#13;
skills. Courses will be aimed particularly at providing in-service training to primary level health staff,&#13;
including LHVs, nurses, and communicable disease program workers. Attention will also be given to the&#13;
needs of medical officers and higher management staff. Technical training will be provided to about 1310&#13;
and 3250 NGO and Government course participants in NA and AJK respectively, and health education&#13;
training will be provided to 2550 and 7050 NGO and Government course participants in the respective&#13;
regions.&#13;
29.   Management and Organizational Development. (US$3.3 million equivalent estimated base cost; 6&#13;
percent of project cost). The objective of this component is to develop the DOHs' and, to some extent the&#13;
NGOs', management capacity to plan and implement more effectively the enhanced programs. DOH&#13;
management particularly needs strengthening in NA. The component will support staff development,&#13;
including strengthening the planning units, integrating the management of the vertical programs into the&#13;
overall health system, replacing military staff, and strengthening the management information system.&#13;
Capacity for planning and management at the district and community levels will be enhanced and&#13;
responsibilities will be increasingly decentralized to these levels through a phased program which links&#13;
training to management and financial devolution. This will mitigate the severe logistical problems and&#13;
facilitate community participation. In-service management and supervisory training, which presently does&#13;
not exist, will be provided to about 150 course participants, mainly Government but including some NGO&#13;
supervisors and facility managers, in NA and 650 in AJK through the new training centers.&#13;
30.   Technical assistance, provided through NGOs and otherwise, will focus on community&#13;
participation, management development, health education, and human resource development. Technical&#13;
assistance will also support project supervision and scholarships. Much of the technical assistance will be&#13;
provided by local consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
D. Program / Project Costs and Financing&#13;
31.   A breakdown of program and project costs and the financing plan are shown in Annex 1. The&#13;
total cost of the health program in NA and AJK is estimated at US$136.7 million equivalent (including&#13;
NGO and community participation activity) (NA -- US$47.1 million and AJK -- US$89.6 million). The&#13;
total project cost is US$57.7 million equivalent (NA -- US$26.0 million and AJK -- US$31.7 million or&#13;
58 and 34 percent respectively of the programs).  Project costs include allowances for physical&#13;
contingencies (US$3.5 million equivalent) and for inflation (US$5.6 million equivalent).  Price&#13;
contingencies plus physical contingencies are equivalent to 19 percent of project base costs. Project costs&#13;
include an estimated US$7.2 million equivalent in taxes and duties. Foreign exchange costs are estimated&#13;
at US$18.7 million equivalent, or about 32 percent of project costs including contingencies.&#13;
32.    The Government will finance an increasing proportion of the total program and project costs&#13;
(including incremental recurrent costs) over the four-year implementation period, financial years 1996/97&#13;
to 1999/2000; the donors will finance the balance. The Federal Government will make available to NA&#13;
and AJK proceeds of the proposed IDA Credit in accordance with its standard budgetary procedures. The&#13;
estimated IDA contribution will be US$26.7 million (46 percent of total project cost), including financing&#13;
of about US$8.6 million equivalent for incremental recurrent costs on a declining basis. The contribution&#13;
from the proposed next round of support for the SAP, which will be complementary to this project, is&#13;
anticipated to be about US$6.1 million (11 percent of total project cost). Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau&#13;
(KfW) will contribute about US$10.6 million (19 percent of total project cost) under parallel financing&#13;
arrangements -- to support NGOs, transport and equipment in NA.&#13;
33.    The proposed project will be carried out in NA and AJK, an area over which India and Pakistan&#13;
have been in dispute since 1947. By including finance for US$26.7 million in the proposed Credit, IDA&#13;
does not thereby intend to prejudice the determination of the claims of the parties.&#13;
34.    Both NA and AJK are considered "Special Areas" by the Federal Government and are dependent&#13;
on the transfer of resources from the Federal Government for both development and recurrent&#13;
expenditure; NA is totally dependent, while AJK receives about two-thirds of its requirements from the&#13;
center. The history of severe underfunding of the sector in the two regions requires substantial inputs to&#13;
remedy accumulated past deficiencies and to ensure the future provision of an acceptable level of&#13;
minimum services. For the past ten years, overall budgets for NA and AJK have declined in real terms,&#13;
which has resulted in pressure on development and recurrent expenditure in the health sectors. One result&#13;
is that non-salary recurrent health expenditure has been squeezed to unacceptably low levels (down from&#13;
32 percent in 1990/91 to 14 percent of the NA recurrent health budget in 1994/95). There has also been a&#13;
tendency for primary health development budgets to fall as expenditure on secondary health facilities&#13;
rises, most notably in AJK where primary health development expenditure has fallen from 60 percent to&#13;
20 percent over the past five years. The proposed project will sharply reverse these trends, through&#13;
budget-related covenants and agreed expenditure programming. Significant sustained increases in the&#13;
health budgets are essential for the four-year project period (see Annex 1, Tables 3 and 4). Overall&#13;
increases average 18% for NA and 11% for AJK, in constant terms. Sub-divided by development and&#13;
recurrent budgets these increases average 15 percent and 18 percent per year from the levels of 1995/96&#13;
for the development and recurrent budgets respectively for NA and 5 percent and 12 percent per year for&#13;
AJK (in constant terms), with the largest increases concentrated in the first two years of project&#13;
implementation. Within the recurrent budget, the critical non-salary part will increase by an average 34&#13;
percent and 18 percent per year for NA and AJK respectively. (See also Economic and Financial&#13;
Assessments, Section III Parts C and D.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
E. Project Implementation&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
35.   As the proposed project is an integral part of the sector program, its implementation will be the&#13;
same as for the program as a whole and will be integrated with continuing work. The four-year project&#13;
will be implemented by the NA and AJK Departments of Health and cooperating NGOs at the&#13;
headquarters, district and community levels. Where necessary, the implementing agencies will be partly&#13;
reorganized and reinforced with additional staff, training, and technical assistance. A detailed project&#13;
implementation plan has been prepared by the Governments and appraised by IDA. The Director of&#13;
Health Services in NA and the Director-General of Health Services in AJK will have overall&#13;
responsibility. Administrative and financial powers that are now centralized at headquarters will be&#13;
increasingly delegated to District Health Officers (DHOs), Hospital Medical Superintendents, and below.&#13;
IDA will deal directly on day-to-day matters with the NA and AJK governments; the federal Ministry of&#13;
Kashmir Affairs and Northern Areas role will be limited to oversight. For the main NGOs, one senior&#13;
officer in each will be nominated as project coordinator.&#13;
36.   For primary services, the program will become a joint effort between communities, local&#13;
government, health-related NGOs and the DOHs. To provide fora for interaction, committees are being&#13;
established both at the headquarters level and at the district and village levels with agreed membership&#13;
and terms of reference. This hierarchy of committees is designed to assist management of the program,&#13;
facilitate decision-making at appropriate levels, promote coordination and involve relevant parties.&#13;
Generally, no such committees exist at present. The Program Steering Committee, will be the overall&#13;
policy, decision-making and coordinating body for the project. The District Health Committee, chaired&#13;
by the DHO, will be the main health body for district operations and will advise on overall district health&#13;
operations and monitor progress toward reaching objectives, including the use of the budget. The DHOs,&#13;
with greater autonomy, will become more responsive and accountable to communities. Community&#13;
Health Committees will be established in NA, linked to existing development committees as appropriate,&#13;
and Union Council Health Committees will be established in AJK. These should evolve into an effective&#13;
network of committees starting in the second year of the project. Their responsibilities include&#13;
identifying and prioritizing community needs, managing health operations for the community, and&#13;
providing feedback to the district committee.&#13;
37.   In NA, the NGO Program Committee will be chaired by Director of Health Services. It is an&#13;
executive arm of the Program Steering Committee and will include representatives from the three major&#13;
NGOs (AKHS, FPAP and MAF); any health-related NGO working in NA may participate by mutual&#13;
agreement. This committee will approve and monitor NGO-related activities and create a forum for&#13;
inter-NGO and NGO-Government coordination; the committee will also consider NGO-related policy&#13;
recommendations. In AJK, where the role of NGOs in mobilizing communities is more limited, an&#13;
SMU will be established by the DOH to provide technical assistance to district mobilization units. The&#13;
SMIJ will be managed by two community development consultants, with expertise in program&#13;
development, management and human resources development and will be responsible for mobilizing&#13;
communities and working to establish community-based service provision.&#13;
Procurement and Disbursement&#13;
38.   Details on procurement, disbursement, and auditing arrangements are provided in Annex 2. IDA&#13;
will finance: (a) goods totaling about US$1.7 million to be procured through international competitive&#13;
bidding (ICB) procedures; (b) works and goods (including medicines) totaling about US$8.8 million to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
be procured through national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures; and (c) goods, works, services and&#13;
operating costs totaling about US$16.2 million to be procured through other procedures, including direct&#13;
contracting and shopping.  Procurement categories and estimated procurement arrangements are&#13;
provided in Annex 2, Table 1. KfW will finance activities in NA only, on a parallel basis, focusing on&#13;
NGOs, equipment, and vehicles and will administer procurement according to their rules and procedures.&#13;
39.   The proposed IDA Credit of US$26.7 million equivalent will be disbursed over 4.5 years, with&#13;
disbursements completed by December 31, 2000. Estimated annual disbursements are shown in Annex&#13;
2, Table 3. Disbursements will follow similar procedures to those being followed under SAP and will&#13;
reimburse the Governments for a proportion of all eligible expenditures.  Specific disbursement&#13;
arrangements for the various expenditure categories are presented in Annex 2, Table 2. To facilitate&#13;
disbursements to NGOs, a Special Account will be established in AJK. This account will be the&#13;
mechanism to provide grants to the affiliated NGOs and communities, which will not have the resources&#13;
to finance activities in advance. The special account will be managed by the AJK DOH and Program&#13;
Steering Committee. Since KfW will fund NGO activities in NA, IDA will not establish a Special&#13;
Account for NGO activities in NA.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
40.   Details on the proposed project's monitoring and evaluation arrangements, including key&#13;
performance indicators to monitor progress in carrying out the various components and achieving the&#13;
development objectives, are provided in Annex 3 and have been agreed between IDA and the regions.&#13;
The Directorates of Health Services in NA and AJK, supported by local consultants and inputs from&#13;
NGOs, will be responsible for monitoring project implementation; both Governments and IDA have&#13;
agreed on a comprehensive list of monitoring indicators. A substantial cross-sectoral monitoring system&#13;
has already been established through SAP and is now in use. The project will be integrated into this&#13;
overall system, as will the project activities to strengthen the management information system and its&#13;
use. A mid-term review will be conducted by September 1998.&#13;
F. Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement&#13;
41.   The design of the proposed project draws on the experience of five health and population-related&#13;
projects supported by IDA in Pakistan, only one of which has closed. They are: SAPP, three ongoing&#13;
projects in the health and population sectors (Family Health4, Second Family Health Project5, and the&#13;
recently effective Population Welfare Program Project) and a population project completed in 19896. The&#13;
main lessons learned include the need for: (a) IDA and other donor support for "reformers" in securing&#13;
health policy development and major budgetary shifts, combined with strong "ownership" of these&#13;
measures by line Departments; (b) securing long-term government commitment to increasing the total&#13;
budget and non-salary recurrent budgets critical to ensuring quality in the social sectors; (c) addressing&#13;
gender issues of both staff and beneficiaries; (d) realism about institutional constraints on capacity building&#13;
and program implementation; (e) community involvement in service provision, especially in supervision&#13;
and contributions; and (f) staff continuity in the line Departments and IDA. Lessons from non-health social&#13;
sector projects in Pakistan include the importance of advance preparation, obtaining early government&#13;
approvals, community participation, and working through the existing implementation system.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

42.    The proposed project has incorporated specific measures that reflect lessons learned, including: (a)&#13;
substantially greater involvement of the governments and NGOs in project preparation than is normally the&#13;
case, as well as ensuring the development and approval of the Health Policy Statements; (b) advance action,&#13;
detailed plans and proposed covenants for phasing in increased recurrent and development allocations for&#13;
health budgets (in addition to funds reallocated from the military to the health budget); (c) the recruitment&#13;
and training of sharply increased numbers of female paramedical workers, including innovative approaches&#13;
to increase the number of female health workers; (d) management training and support to increase central&#13;
and district level capacity combined with decentralization; (e) strengthening community involvement,&#13;
including developing bodies representing the Government, NGOs and communities to support coordinated&#13;
planning, implementation and supervision; and (f) reaching an understanding that staff transfers would be&#13;
limited. The annual plan and review mechanism will be central to ensuring sustained progress on many of&#13;
these critical factors.&#13;
G. Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
43.    The proposed project is fully consistent with IDA's Country Assistance Strategy for Pakistan,&#13;
discussed in the Board on December 19, 1995, and with the conclusions of the recently completed Poverty&#13;
Assessment7. Pakistan's social indicators and gender-based differences in education and health are among&#13;
the world's worst. These problems contribute to high population growth which itself impedes efforts to&#13;
alleviate poverty. The health sectors in NA and AJK are considerably worse off than in the provinces, and&#13;
have been seriously neglected by both the Federal Government and the donors. SAP is crucial to IDA's&#13;
policy to promote increased public and private activity in the social sectors and to alleviate poverty. Overall&#13;
funding and policy issues for primary level health in NA and AJK are beginning to be addressed through&#13;
SAP; the two regions' performance under SAP has been encouraging. These macro efforts must be&#13;
underpinned by efforts to advance the entire health sector, by increased institutional capacity, and by a&#13;
detailed operational plan. The project and SAP closely complement each other.&#13;
44.   IDA is committed to advancing the health sector in Pakistan and has made significant progress in a&#13;
relatively short time through three health and population projects and the umbrella SAPP all in the past five&#13;
years. The proposed project will extend this commitment to NA and AJK and thus complete national&#13;
coverage. To date, political circumstances have precluded other donors' support to programs in NA and&#13;
AJK. As a multilateral agency with significant experience in the health sector in South Asia, IDA is in the&#13;
best position to assist these long neglected regions.&#13;
m. Assessments&#13;
A. Technical Assessment&#13;
45.    The project design is technically sound and based on internationally accepted standards&#13;
recommended by the World Health Organization and the 1993 World Development Report (WDR),&#13;
Investing in Health. The focus on improving services for reproductive-aged women and children reflects&#13;
attention to the most vulnerable groups. The proposed project will support expansion and strengthening&#13;
of the most cost-effective interventions available to reduce infant, child and maternal morbidity and&#13;
mortality, as well as to reduce fertility. These well-established straight-forward interventions have been&#13;
proved throughout the world and have the endorsement of international and Pakistani professional&#13;
organizations.&#13;
7 Pakistan Poverty Assessment, Report No. 14397-PAK, September 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
46.   Interventions to improve maternal health include: pre-natal care (including tetanus toxoid&#13;
injections); nutrition services, especially for iron deficiency; management of normal deliveries;&#13;
identification and management of pregnancy-related complications; post-natal care; and identification&#13;
and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. Substantial and sustained improvements, particularly in&#13;
maternal mortality, will require a continuum of care which includes detection and adequate management&#13;
of obstetric complications, such as obstructed labor and hemorrhage, and other emergencies; thus, the&#13;
project should address selected aspects of hospital-level capacity and efficiency, as well as transport and&#13;
communications. Interventions to improve family planning include: access to a range of quality clinical&#13;
and non-clinical methods of contraception (both temporary and permanent) and counseling. Interventions&#13;
to improve child health include: immunization; treatment of life-threatening illnesses like diarrhea, TB,&#13;
and ARI; treatment of other illnesses, like worm infestations, measles, and poliomyelitis; and&#13;
identification and management of pediatric complications that require hospital care. Other interventions,&#13;
which would benefit all groups, include: nutritional services, especially for iodine deficiency; facilities&#13;
and equipment to treat the most common life-threatening emergencies; referral and transportation&#13;
systems that direct patients to appropriate levels of care; and health education that is relevant,&#13;
appropriate in content and medium to the locality, and focused on key themes like nutrition, hygiene,&#13;
disease prevention, and family planning.&#13;
B. Institutional Assessment&#13;
47.    The institutional capacities in NA and AJK are very different. In NA, management systems for&#13;
effective provision of health services are weak, but services have been very successfully provided by&#13;
NGOs and communities, especially AKHS. While NGO services will expand, Government capacity also&#13;
needs to increase to ensure service availability throughout NA. In AJK, the DOH has strong civilian&#13;
management with better support systems, yet there has been very little involvement of NGOs and&#13;
communities.  Through the proposed project, each region is well placed to strengthen weaker&#13;
institutional aspects by learning from its neighbor's successes.&#13;
48.    The DOH in NA has not had any major organizational change in 15 years -- it has only been&#13;
slowly expanding services. It has only two professional staff at the center, one of which, the Director, is&#13;
seconded from the military. Management is underdeveloped due to lack of adequate staff and lack of&#13;
staffing continuity. As a result, systems that have evolved are subjective and person dependent. At the&#13;
district level, management comprises local well-qualified civilians, who are highly committed. But, lack&#13;
of management systems at the center necessarily means that they are handicapped at this level also.&#13;
Nevertheless, district managers perform reasonably well, given the very limited resources available to&#13;
them, and are highly motivated to introduce better planning and management.&#13;
49.    AKRSP and AKHS will play a significant role in institutional capacity building efforts in NA.&#13;
They do not have a highly formalized structure or operational guidelines (common for NGOs), but the&#13;
staff are highly motivated and committed to quality performance. They are used to working with donor&#13;
agencies and have limited experience with formal Government relations, but are committed to forging a&#13;
productive working relationship with Government.&#13;
50.   In AJK, although there is a military Secretary, the Director-General and his central staff (about&#13;
10 civilian managers and professionals) control day-to-day DOH activities. Although most staff have&#13;
some management training, they are eager to improve their health planning and management skills.&#13;
While this top-down approach has provided reasonable health services, NGOs and communities are an as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
yet untapped resource. The AJK DOH has only limited experience in community involvement, but they&#13;
are keen to experiment with different community participation strategies.&#13;
51.    Technical assistance will draw on lessons from  the neighboring region and will address&#13;
institutional weaknesses in such areas as management and information systems, logistics, training, and&#13;
community development. The assistance will take into account the particular difficulties of managing&#13;
and supervising basic service provision with limited resources in extremely harsh conditions.&#13;
Management development, especially in NA, has already started.&#13;
C. Economic Assessment, Benefits and Risks&#13;
Benefits&#13;
52.   The proposed project will improve the health status of this very poor and under-served&#13;
population. There will be a special emphasis on improving the health of women and young children,&#13;
who are particularly disadvantaged, by meeting the urgent need for increased MCH and family&#13;
planning services. It is estimated that by the end of the project, over two million women and children&#13;
will have benefited from increased access to better quality primary health care services. This would&#13;
result in a decline in infant and maternal mortality of about 30 percent over four years. Other groups&#13;
in the population would also experience gains in their health status, in terms of both reduced mortality&#13;
and morbidity.&#13;
53.    The above health benefits are desirable in themselves -- that is, they would have a direct impact&#13;
on the welfare of households, quite apart from any effects on economic productivity. Improvements in&#13;
health status would also increase individuals' capacity as economic agents. Healthy individuals are&#13;
more productive contributors to the economy and lose less work time as a result of illness. Moreover,&#13;
well-nourished children learn better and are likely to become more productive adults.&#13;
54.   The proposed project will also contribute to the national goal of reducing fertility.  An&#13;
objective of the project is to increase the provision of family planning services, thereby helping&#13;
individual families to determine the number and spacing of their children and reduce exposure to the&#13;
risks associated with pregnancy. At the same time, improvements in MCH would contribute to demand&#13;
for contraception. Through increased access to family planning services, the project anticipates that the&#13;
contraceptive prevalence rate in NA and AJK would increase from about 10 to about 24 percent.&#13;
Cost Effectiveness&#13;
55.   The design and preparation of the proposed project are intended to develop the most cost-&#13;
effective approach for achieving the objectives. In both NA and AJK, where the needs are very basic&#13;
and the existing services are rudimentary, the project will focus on ensuring the availability of the most&#13;
essential basic services, along the lines of the minimum essential package of services defined in the&#13;
1993 WDR. Committing to the essential package requires giving priority to investments in public&#13;
health -- including immunization, family planning and nutrition information -- and to essential clinical&#13;
services -- including pregnancy-related care, control of TB, and care for the common serious illnesses&#13;
of young children.&#13;
56.   The question of how to deliver these services most cost-effectively in the conditions of NA and&#13;
AJK was focused on. Alternatives analyzed include: (a) facility-based births versus home-based births;&#13;
(b) various numbers of ante-natal visits for expectant mothers; (c) providing separate MCH centers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15-&#13;
versus integrating such services in existing facilities; (d) new construction versus upgrading existing&#13;
facilities; (e) heating either by firewood, electricity, kerosene, or solar energy; (f) creating new&#13;
institutions for pre-service training versus modifying existing institutions; and (g) strengthening existing&#13;
vertical communicable diseases control programs versus integrating the programs into the overall health&#13;
system. In each case, the most cost-effective alternative was chosen.&#13;
57.    Due primarily to the inhospitable terrain, low  population density and highly scattered&#13;
population, harsh climate and the lack of basic infrastructure, per capita operating costs of delivering&#13;
health services in NA and AJK will be relatively high compared to the rest of the country. At present,&#13;
the average per capita cost in the provinces is US$2.3, while in NA and AJK it is US$3.6 and US$3.8.&#13;
Moreover, in the provinces, the amount that individuals pay from their pockets for health services is&#13;
typically at least as much as the Government spends. In NA and AJK, private commercial health&#13;
services are almost non-existent and the government has to assume the full burden of providing health&#13;
services. Thus, per capita government costs could be expected to be substantially greater than those of,&#13;
say, Punjab and still be reasonable.&#13;
58.    For the first time in Pakistan, a detailed analysis of unit costs for different levels of health&#13;
facilities (including staffing and operational costs) has been completed during the preparation of this&#13;
project. These data provide a firm basis for estimating the programs' costs for essential primary and&#13;
basic secondary services. At the end of the project, the average annual per capita cost of delivering&#13;
health services is expected to be approximately US$8.9 in NA and US$7.2 in AJK (current prices) --&#13;
about 2 to 2.5 times the present per capita cost of delivering health services in the two regions. This&#13;
jump is substantial but sustainable (see "Financial Assessment") and warranted, given the past neglect&#13;
of these regions and the improved quality and quantity of services. Furthermore, the estimated annual&#13;
per capita cost of providing the more limited minimum essential package of services in NA and AJK is&#13;
US$6.2 and US$4.3 respectively, well below the 1993 WDR average estimate for low income countries&#13;
of US$12 per capita (1990 prices). An analysis of cost-effectiveness using the Disability Adjusted Life&#13;
Years (DALY) approach, as outlined in the 1993 WDR, was also conducted. The analysis shows that&#13;
the average cost of a DALY saved as a consequence of the project would be about US$30. This figure&#13;
is in line with the estimates of the 1993 WDR for similar interventions in low-income countries under&#13;
reasonably efficient conditions, which generally range from US$12-US$50 per DALY saved. The&#13;
above comparison indicates that the project interventions would be highly cost-effective.&#13;
59.    The program approach (described in Section II) will ensure that limited public resources are&#13;
efficiently and effectively allocated throughout the health sector through a holistic approach. This&#13;
approach is based on agreement on overall sector policies and a well-developed plan of activities for the&#13;
four year period, conflrmed through detailed annual agreements. This will ensure the financing of the&#13;
highly cost-effective minimum essential package of services and fewer politically popular, but not cost-&#13;
effective, investments.&#13;
Risks&#13;
60.   The main risk is that the limited capacity of the DOHs would be further strained by their lack&#13;
of familiarity with implementing a program approach, and by introducing community participation&#13;
including relying on substantial NGO cooperation. If such problems arose, they would undermine the&#13;
entire project. This risk would be addressed by: (a) including substantial management development&#13;
and technical support to ensure that the health systems function in a more efficient and streamlined&#13;
fashion; (b) simplifying the project components as much as possible, limiting them to essentials,&#13;
completing detailed preparation well in advance and recognizing that the program approach is less&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
administratively demanding than a traditional approach; and (c) particularly in NA, drawing on the&#13;
experience and support of NGOs that have operated in these types of geographical and socioeconomic&#13;
conditions for many years, working extensively with these NGOs during project development, and&#13;
ensuring increased involvement of communities.&#13;
61.   A second risk to the health programs in the two regions is that the Government would fail in its&#13;
commitment to finance the programs initially or continue with their financing, especially since the&#13;
Federal Government is committed to reduce the fiscal deficit and recently made cuts in expenditure.&#13;
However, social sector expenditure has been -- and is expected to continue to be -- protected, especially&#13;
through the umbrella of SAP, a program to which the Government is sincerely committed. Since SAP&#13;
began, the Government's record in complying with budgetary undertakings for the social sectors has&#13;
been good. Again, if such problems arose, it would undermine a substantial part of the project.&#13;
62.   A third risk is that proposed changes in health policies would not be achieved or would be&#13;
significantly delayed and stall overall implementation. This risk is addressed through the program&#13;
approach design, which requires agreed policy documents as well as annual agreement on specific&#13;
reforms in addition to detailed work plans. Close links with the SAP umbrella operation would provide&#13;
further leverage, as would the strengthening of the role of NGOs and communities in the provision of&#13;
health services.&#13;
63.   A fourth risk is that the requisite female staff necessary to provide MCH services would prove&#13;
to be unavailable. If this occurred, it would negate the most important operational objective of the&#13;
project -- improving women's health. Gender issues were carefully considered in the project design,&#13;
which includes working through community and women's organizations to recruit female staff. Pre-&#13;
service training under the project is mostly for women and special efforts to recruit suitable tutors have&#13;
already begun. Incentives for female staff would be introduced and female health staff would be posted&#13;
to facilities located in their home areas. Experience during preparation has been encouraging.&#13;
64.   A fifth and political risk is that any resurgence of ethnic strife in NA would impede&#13;
implementation there. Similarly, any increase in tension over the disputed status of NA and AJK could&#13;
affect project implementation. Given the high priority of improving health care in these neglected&#13;
areas, these risks overall are considered acceptable.&#13;
D. Financial Assessment&#13;
65.    Financial requirements of the proposed project have been reviewed and agreed upon with the&#13;
Governments, who have committed to provide the additional resources required. The design of the&#13;
project, with the program approach applied to the whole of the development and recurrent budgets, the&#13;
link to SAP, and the project financial conditions ensure that financial feasibility is fully considered and&#13;
that additional resources would materialize. The health sector budgets of NA and AJK are a small part&#13;
of the total Federal budgets -- only about .09 percent. So the increases planned for NA and AJK health&#13;
sector budgets as a part of the overall budget are extremely small and sustainable. One result of the&#13;
accumulated past budget deficiencies is that staff salaries have cut into non-salary budget components,&#13;
further eroding the quality of service delivery. The situation is especially acute in NA, where the&#13;
salary component in 1994/95 absorbed about 85 percent of the health recurrent budget. It is essential&#13;
that this is rectified (a good start has been made with the doubling of the NA non-salary recurrent&#13;
budget during 1995/96, as agreed under the SAP). Nearly 60 percent of the program costs are&#13;
recurrent. The proposed IDA Credit will finance, on a declining basis, approximately 42 percent of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
incremental recurrent budget during the program period, easing the burden on Government over the&#13;
four-years and ensuring the effectiveness of public health services.&#13;
66.   Adequate and timely provision of funds to the sector is critical to the success of the proposed&#13;
program. Releases of funds have improved considerably in the last two years due to SAP agreements.&#13;
Over the four years, the development part of the budgets would need to increase in real terms by an&#13;
annual average of 15 and 5 percent in NA and AJK respectively. Expenditure would be mainly for&#13;
replacement equipment and transport, plus some upgrading, especially for training facilities. Similarly,&#13;
the recurrent part of the budgets, which is mainly non-salary expenditure, would need to increase in&#13;
real terms by an annual average of 18 and 12 percent in NA and AJK respectively, not counting the&#13;
phasing-out of the military contributions. These are large proportional increases, but very modest in&#13;
absolute terms. It is projected that, at the end of the program period, the share of the health sector in&#13;
the total budget (development plus recurrent), assuming a four percent real annual increase in GDP,&#13;
would rise from 8 and 7 percent to 12 and 9 percent for NA and AJK respectively, with most of the&#13;
increase in the recurrent part of the budgets. These are marginal increases within the context of the&#13;
total federal budget; the Federal and regional Governments have committed to fund these enhanced&#13;
levels and allocate them as in the agreed programs. This undertaking is critical and will be carefully&#13;
monitored both through the proposed project and the SAP.&#13;
67.   Both NA and AJK Health Policy Statements give priority to implementing the package of&#13;
minimum essential services. Such minimum essential services would in principle be provided free or at&#13;
only nominal charges -- given the depth and breadth of poverty in the regions. Nonetheless, within the&#13;
component to strengthen community and NGO participation, there will be experiments to&#13;
institutionalize user fees, especially for curative services, with revenues retained by the facility. This&#13;
may be additional to other community inputs such as labor and land. At the referral levels, forms of&#13;
user fees are already in place, with charges somewhat higher than in the rest of Pakistan -- but cost&#13;
recovery is still marginal. Both NA and AJK recognize the need for more realistic user fees at referral&#13;
levels, given adequate safeguards for the poor.&#13;
E. Environmental Assessment&#13;
68.   No adverse impact on the environment is expected from the proposed project; it was determined to&#13;
be in screening Category C. In the long term, it would benefit the environment through lower population&#13;
pressure and improved health conditions. All medical waste from health facilities will be sorted by type and&#13;
collected in color-coded polythene bags. Tissue waste will be buried a- -ay from human settlements. Non-&#13;
tissue waste from district HQ hospitals will be incinerated while that from lower-level facilities will be&#13;
buried.&#13;
F. Participatory Approach&#13;
69.    A central element of the proposed project is the development of a partnership between the&#13;
Government, NGOs, and communities. Such a strong community-oriented approach has not been tried&#13;
previously in large health projects in Pakistan. However, experience suggests that such an approach is&#13;
feasible, especially given favorable cultural factors and encouraging experiences of facilitating community&#13;
participation through NGOs. As discussed above, NA already has well-established community participation&#13;
and community-oriented health services that can be expanded. In AJK, where experience with community&#13;
organization is more recent, the approach will be to build on communities' long-standing informal&#13;
cooperation with the DOH and various types of partnership will be tested and carefully assessed before&#13;
replication on a wider scale.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
70.   "Ownership" of the proposed project in NA and AJK is unusually strong; project preparation was&#13;
undertaken by the DOHs with the assistance of Pakistani consultants, NGOs and beneficiary representatives,&#13;
with technical advice from the World Bank Resident Mission in Pakistan. A series of project development&#13;
workshops were held and a large amount of information collected and analyzed. High quality work was&#13;
completed in a very collegial way.&#13;
IV. Legal Commitment of the Borrower&#13;
71.   The formally adopted NA and AJK Health Policy Statements include, in the Governments' own&#13;
words, many key technical reforms including commitments on community participation, provision of&#13;
family planning services, increasing female paramedical staff, decentralization of powers, severely&#13;
limiting new clinic construction, and improving medicines purchase and supply. These and related&#13;
understandings were confirmed at Negotiations.&#13;
72.   During Negotiations, the Federal Government on behalf of the NA Administration and the AJK&#13;
Government as appropriate provided assurances that:&#13;
(a) (i) annual operational plans for each project year will be prepared and agreed with IDA,&#13;
covering both government and non-government inputs, and their activity, financial (both&#13;
development and recurrent) and reform content agreed with IDA; (ii) the agreed plans will be&#13;
satisfactorily implemented; (iii) any material changes to the agreed plans would have the prior&#13;
approval of IDA; and (iv) funds will be released to the Departments of Health by the fifteenth of&#13;
the first month of every quarter (para. 11);&#13;
(b) during the period 1996/97 to 1999/00, the overall level of spending on the program and on the&#13;
non-salary recurrent part of the program will rise by an average of 18 percent and 34 percent per&#13;
annum, respectively, for NA and 11 percent and 18 percent per annum, respectively, for AJK, all&#13;
in constant price terms (para. 34);&#13;
(c) an adequate number of qualified service delivery staff will be made available to assist in&#13;
implementation of the program and no actions to restrict or prohibit the recruitment of such staff&#13;
will be taken (para. 27);&#13;
(d) additional management positions in the district offices of the Departments of Health, as&#13;
agreed upon in the first operational plans, will be created and filled by February 28, 1997 (para.&#13;
29);&#13;
(e) arrangements satisfactory to IDA will be made for obtaining and maintaining adequate&#13;
provision of technical assistance and the involvement of NGOs and communities in the&#13;
implementation of the project (paras. 18 &amp; 30);&#13;
(f) the Steering Committee, the NGO Program Committee, and the District Health Committees&#13;
will each meet at least quarterly (paras. 36 &amp; 37);&#13;
(g) NA and AJK will participate in annual government/NGO/community/donor reviews of the&#13;
past year (para. 11); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19 -&#13;
(h) standard conditions for monitoring program implementation; providing brief semi-annual&#13;
progress reports; auditing; holding a mid-term review by September 1998; and preparing an&#13;
Implementation Completion Report (paras. 39 &amp; 40).&#13;
73.   The special conditions of Credit Effectiveness are: (a) (i) receipt of satisfactory operational plans&#13;
for health sector activities for NA and AJK for 1996/97 and (ii) documentation of satisfactory progress for&#13;
1995/96; and (b) approval of the project PC-Is by the Executive Committee of the National Economic&#13;
Council (ECNEC) (paras. 11 &amp; 13).&#13;

NORTHERN HEALTH PROGRAM PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
Procurement, Disbursement and Auditing Arrangements&#13;
A. Procurement&#13;
1.    The program nature of the proposed project makes it difficult to forecast in detail, at the outset,&#13;
both the total procurement amounts for different categories of expenditure and the anticipated amounts&#13;
of IDA financing within these categories. Figures given below and in Table I should be regarded as&#13;
indicative; final details will be discussed between the Govemments and IDA as part of the regular yearly&#13;
agreements. Procurement of goods, services, and works financed by the IDA Credit will be undertaken in&#13;
accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995).&#13;
The project's cofinancier, KfW, will administer procurement for the parts of the project that it is&#13;
financing according to its rules and procedures. With the close association between this project and&#13;
SAPP, procurement procedures for both will be the same; the arrangements summarized below mirror&#13;
those already approved for SAPP. Each DOH has prepared sample contracts for the procurement of civil&#13;
works, vehicles, drugs and medicines, and technical assistance; these documents were confirmed as&#13;
being generally acceptably by IDA.&#13;
2.    Approximately 35 percent of total project costs are recurrent, covering operational expenditures,&#13;
including medicines (64 percent of funds for community participation and NGOs are included in this&#13;
category). Most procurement is expected to involve small contracts often spread over widely dispersed&#13;
geographical areas and throughout the project period. The nature of such contracts is unlikely to attract&#13;
the interest of foreign bidders and will therefore be suitable only for National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB) and prudent shopping. The requirement for large procurement operations will be confined to&#13;
vehicles and consultant contracts; with minor exceptions, these will be suitable for International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB) which will be based on the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents.&#13;
Procurement will be conducted by the DOHs and NGOs as appropriate.&#13;
3.    The civil works included in the proposed project amount to US$7.5 million (IDA financing is&#13;
US$4.3 million) and mainly comprises modest additions and upgrading to existing rural clinics, plus six&#13;
small training facilities. A provision of US$700,000 from the IDA financed amount has been made for&#13;
remote areas where contracts, each valued not more than US$25,000, will be awarded by soliciting bids&#13;
from at least three local contractors. Equipment and furniture expenditure over the four-year period will&#13;
be approximately US$5.4 million (IDA financing is US$2.5 million) and comprises clinic equipment,&#13;
kits for staff, medical accessories, small audio-visual equipment, and basic furniture. Most items will be&#13;
procured through NCB except for items which cannot be grouped into packages of at least US$25,000,&#13;
up to an aggregate not to exceed US$400,000 per agency, which may be procured on the basis of prudent&#13;
shopping.  Expenditures on medicines are estimated at US$4.9 million (IDA financing is US$1.5&#13;
million) and comprises pharmaceuticals and reagents. These will mostly be procured through NCB.&#13;
Special provision totaling US$400,000 of the IDA financed amount over the life of the project for&#13;
contracts valued not more than US$25,000 has been made for other methods such as shopping in the&#13;
event of unforeseen shortages or to cover other emergencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

4.     Government's NCB procedures, already used in on-going IDA funded projects, are satisfactory&#13;
and acceptable to IDA. To address shortcomings identified in their implementation, provisions have&#13;
been made under SAPP for training of staff involved in procurement, and will be extended to cover&#13;
procurement of goods and services under ICB procedures. Under SAPP, provision has also been made&#13;
for procurement consultants to review, among other things, the selection process for all contracts costing&#13;
US$100,000 or more and to review all contracts above US$50,000. These arrangements are in place and&#13;
will continue. Since few contracts will reach these thresholds, the need for such reviews will be small.&#13;
Contracts above US$200,000 will be reviewed by IDA.&#13;
5.    Concerning items requiring ICB procedures, vehicles (about US$6.1 million for the project, of&#13;
which IDA financing is US$1.7 million) should be procured by the local DOHs. However, in order to&#13;
meet urgent needs, contracts for vehicles totaling up to US$500,000 of IDA financing over the life of the&#13;
project may be procured through NCB procedures. In addition, the few vehicles to be purchased by&#13;
NGOs may be procured through National Shopping.&#13;
6.    As described in para. 18 of the main text, direct project support for NGO-related activities is in&#13;
two main parts: (a) to three well-established existing NGOs; and (b) to strengthen and support smaller&#13;
NGOs. The three highly reputable NGOs (the Aga Khan Network and especially the Aga Khan Health&#13;
Services in NA only; the Family Planning Association of Pakistan in NA and AJK; and the Marie&#13;
Adelaide Foundation in NA and AJK) are well-established in these regions with substantial continuing&#13;
programs of their own which are well coordinated with the governments' programs. The project will&#13;
support expansion of these existing programs both geographically and in content. These three NGOs are&#13;
the only sizable NGOs currently operating in the health sector in these two remote regions. Increased&#13;
services provided by them are a highly cost-effective means of providing quality inputs in very difficult&#13;
terrain. There are no alternative ways of providing such services and so the project will finance inputs&#13;
directly to these three NGOs.&#13;
7.    In both NA and AJK, modest funds will be established to strengthen and support smaller NGOs&#13;
and community groups which wish to start or expand health and family planning activities (see para. 22&#13;
of the main text). The Government and the Donors have agreed upon criteria which the NGOs and their&#13;
project proposals must fulfill-- any project must qualify both on NGO and proposal grounds to be&#13;
considered for funding. Meeting these criteria will ensure that only established legitimate NGOs&#13;
participate in the NGO fund. The criteria for NGOs include being: a registered body in existence for at&#13;
least one year; able to generate, manage and account for funds; able (at an appropriate level) to manage,&#13;
monitor, account, report, fund-raise and audit; willing to work in rural and/or difficult areas; willing to&#13;
use community-oriented approaches; and willing to work in partnership with the public sector. The&#13;
criteria for NGO Projects include: responsiveness to local health needs; technical and economical&#13;
feasibility; development-oriented rather than welfare-oriented approach; ability to be replicated; services&#13;
that are distinct and do not overlap or duplicate other services; services that are offered to all members of&#13;
the community especially women and children; and, demonstrable plans to become financially&#13;
sustainable beyond the period of funding. Particular care will be exercised to ensure that the NGOs are&#13;
genuinely administratively and operationally autonomous from the Government. Proposals for all NGO&#13;
Projects must be submitted before June 30, 1999. Projects will be limited to a maximum duration of&#13;
three years. IDA will review the first three NGO Project proposals submitted for funding and all&#13;
proposals of over US$100,000. Other applications will not require IDA's prior approval, but detailed&#13;
documentation will be maintained by the NGO Program Committee for possible future review.&#13;
Eligibility criteria will be the same for NGOs and NGO Projects in both NA and AJK, but, KfW will&#13;
finance NGO activities in NA and IDA will finance NGO activities in AJK.&#13;

8.     Technical assistance contracts for NA and AJK are anticipated to be mostly small, but some&#13;
international procurement will be necessary. The DOHs will be responsible for procurement of technical&#13;
assistance for institutional development and training (US$2.0 million, entirely financed by IDA) in&#13;
accordance with Bank policies and procedures on the selection and employment of consultants for&#13;
specialist services, overseas training, and studies as contained in Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). Consultant contract&#13;
packages that exceed US$100,000 will be based on the Bank's Standard Form of Contracts for&#13;
Consultants, June 1995. Consultant contracts with individuals that are smaller than US$100,000 will use a&#13;
simpler contract form.&#13;
9.    IDA will review all ICB and contracts above US$200,000 equivalent, as well as the first four&#13;
contracts in each agency irrespective of their value; all other contracts will be subject to selective post-&#13;
review. Consultant services will be engaged by the NA and AJK authorities concemed, as appropriate.&#13;
All consultants will be selected in accordance with IDA guidelines, which include prior review of all&#13;
contracts with consulting firms costing the equivalent of US$100,000 or more and with individual&#13;
consultants costing the equivalent of US$50,000 or more. Other procurement arrangements subject to&#13;
prior review by IDA include: all single-source consultant contracts, consultant contracts for assignments&#13;
of a critical nature as determined by IDA, amendments to IDA-financed contracts of consulting firms&#13;
raising the contract value to the equivalent of US$100,000 or more, and amendments to IDA-financed&#13;
contracts of consulting individuals raising the contract value to the equivalent of US$50,000 and terms of&#13;
reference for technical assistance (including studies) and training.&#13;
10.   The training, technical support and direct assistance provided by the SAPP Multi-Donor Support&#13;
Unit to NA and AJK staff will be instrumental in facilitating national or international procurement of&#13;
goods and services.&#13;
B. Disbursement&#13;
11.    Credit disbursement under the proposed project will follow the procedures developed for SAPP.&#13;
To ensure that Government commitment is translated into increased allocation and timely release and&#13;
timely expenditure of funds, the project will reimburse against actual expenditure and on the basis of&#13;
actions already taken. The project will reimburse a proportion of all eligible expenditures incurred in the&#13;
health sectors in NA and AJK, excluding any already funded by other donor-aided projects. The annual&#13;
agreement between Government and IDA (and other project donors) will include detailed identification of&#13;
eligible categories of expenditure.&#13;
12.    The proposed project will provide reimbursements for incremental expenditures under the project,&#13;
while SAPP will continue to reimburse at about its established level for NA and AJK. Both projects&#13;
would place particular emphasis upon increasing non-salary recurrent allocations and ensuring the timely&#13;
release of the budgets within the first quarter of each fiscal year.&#13;
13.    Certain categories of expenditure have been identified as outside the project, and therefore&#13;
ineligible for project funding. These include services in the referral sub-sector other than for accident,&#13;
emergency, and obstetric care. Other expenditure categories, such as land acquisition, taxes and duties&#13;
are ineligible under IDA rules. Apart from these exceptions, all expenditure incurred in delivering the&#13;
health programs will be eligible including salaries, operating expenses, supplies, goods, civil works and&#13;
maintenance expenses. Given the nature of the health program, the only potential problem arises from the&#13;
need to exclude taxes and duties. However, as under SAPP, the resulting reimbursement rate on eligible&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
ANNEX2&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
expenditure will be such that this constraint will not be binding. The tax component will therefore not be&#13;
isolated for purposes of calculating reimbursement.&#13;
14.    The present functional and object classification for budgeting and reporting is adequate to&#13;
distinguish between eligible health and non-eligible health expenditures as now envisaged. However,&#13;
should new categories of non-eligibility be agreed in the future, Government would develop (and agree&#13;
with IDA on) suitable classifications. The existing reporting system is adequate to permit monthly&#13;
identification and reporting of all qualifying expenditures.&#13;
15.    As with SAPP, reimbursement will be claimed at least quarterly and perhaps more frequently,&#13;
depending on the capacity of the NA and AJK Governments to generate the claims. Claims will normally&#13;
be made in the form of a Statement of Expenditure (SOE) specifying categories of expenditure (civil&#13;
works, staff costs, goods, operating expenditure, etc.) and total eligible expenditure. Disbursement for&#13;
training will also be made on the basis of SOEs. In those few cases where contracts for goods and civil&#13;
works exceed US$200,000 equivalent, consulting firms exceed US$100,000 equivalent, and individual&#13;
consultants exceed US$50,000 equivalent, full documentation will be required. Each SOE will be&#13;
supported by a financial statement, retained by the borrower, separating expenditure by function and&#13;
object, together with a summary of Annual Development Plan (ADP)-scheme expenditure. The SOE will&#13;
not differentiate between foreign and local content. Where an SOE covers expenditure within an on-&#13;
going project, the SOE will specify the portion eligible for reimbursement. Reconciliation of the&#13;
statements of receipts expected from other donors, if any, will be required. All claims will be certified by&#13;
the Secretaries of the respective DOHs, who will then submit them to IDA. Only claims above&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent will be submitted to IDA for reimbursement/ payment. SOEs will have to be&#13;
received by IDA within four months of the end of the fiscal year in which the expenditure was incurred.&#13;
This will ensure flexible reallocation of unused resources from portions of the program which may be&#13;
underspending, and maximum funding availability for those areas of the program where expenditures are&#13;
occurring.&#13;
16.    Credit disbursements will finance: (a) for vehicles (procured by ICB): 100 percent of foreign&#13;
expenditures of direct imports, 100 percent of ex-factory cost for locally manufactured items procured&#13;
through ICB, and 65 percent of local expenditures for items procured locally; (b) for consultant services&#13;
and training and grants for Community Participation and NGOs (see below), 100 percent of the costs net&#13;
of taxes (except for vehicles, where 65 percent of local expenditures for items procured locally will be&#13;
financed). Expenditures on other items for approved sub-programs will be reimbursed at a fixed&#13;
percentage, agreed annually between the Governments and IDA. See Table 2 for a summary of&#13;
Disbursement Categories.&#13;
17.   NGO Special Account: It is expected that almost all disbursements for NGO activities, whether&#13;
to dhe three larger NGO programs or the NGO fund, will pass through the Special Account that will be&#13;
established and used only for NGO-related disbursements. The DOH and the Program Steering/ NGO&#13;
Committee will manage the NGO fund for both NA and AJK. In order to facilitate implementation, a&#13;
Special Account of US$400,000 will be established in Muzzafarabad (AJK). This Special Account will&#13;
be used to finance all eligible (foreign and local) expenditures. Replenishments to the Special Account&#13;
will be submitted on a monthly basis or whenever 20 percent of the Special Account outstanding balance&#13;
has been used, whichever occurs first. At its option, for expenditures above US$100,000, DOH of AJK&#13;
may submit payment requests directly to IDA outside the Special Account. Since KfW will fund NGO&#13;
..ctivities in NA (see para. 39 of main text), IDA will not establish a Special Account for NA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 5 of 7&#13;
18. Disbursements for the proposed IDA Credit of US$26.7 million will cover expenditures incurred&#13;
from 1996/97 to 1999/2000. Actual annual disbursement will depend on performance, the pattern of&#13;
expenditure agreed upon, and the availability of other donor funds. See Table 3 for estimates of annual&#13;
disbursements.&#13;
C. Accounts and Auditing&#13;
19.   The DOH and the large NGOs in each region will maintain separate accounts of project&#13;
expenditures in accordance with sound accounting practices, and project accounts will be audited in&#13;
accordance with Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World&#13;
Bank (1992).  The accounts, SOEs and procurement documentation will be audited each year by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The audit reports will be submitted to IDA no later than nine&#13;
months following the end of the Government fiscal year. The reports will include an assessment of the&#13;
adequacy of the accounting system and internal financial control, the reliability of the SOEs and the&#13;
degree of compliance with agreed financial arrangements.&#13;

PAKISTAN&#13;
NORTHERN HEALTH PROGRAM PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
Monitoring And Evaluation Plan And Project Performance Indicators&#13;
A. Progress Reviews and Reporting&#13;
1.    The Directorates of Health Services in NA and AJK, supported by local consultants and inputs&#13;
from NGOs, will monitor and report independently every six months to IDA on program progress and,&#13;
annually, prepare a detailed operational plan for the coming year. The respective Governments' will&#13;
produce semi-annual progress reports, the detailed forrnat of which will be agreed with IDA during the&#13;
project launch mission. The initial progress report will be due on February 28, 1997, with succeeding&#13;
reports due on August 31 and February 28 of each year until project completion. The reports will: (i)&#13;
include a concise, narrative section describing major project achievements and problems encountered;&#13;
(ii) use a simple, tabular account to show details of actual accomplishments compared to agreed plans;&#13;
and (iii) propose future actions. The key indicators to be used in monitoring and evaluating overall&#13;
project implementation progress and results, and assessing the performance of each of the components,&#13;
are provided in Table 2 below.&#13;
2.     Ultimately, service providers are accountable to the communities they serve. With the greater&#13;
participatory approach and delegation of decision authority, monitoring at the district level and below is&#13;
particularly important. During preparation, a concerted effort was made to establish qualitative systems&#13;
of monitoring client satisfaction at the grassroots level by involving representatives of beneficiaries and&#13;
field-level service providers. The Project Steering Committee, and their counterparts at the district and&#13;
lower levels, will use monitoring indicators for making and reviewing management decisions as well as&#13;
for reviewing progress.&#13;
3.    Prior to Negotiations, the Governments and IDA agreed on a list of monitoring indicators.&#13;
During Negotiations, it was agreed that: (a) semi-annual progress reports would be prepared by the&#13;
DOHs and submitted to IDA; (b) a joint Government and IDA mid-term review would be conducted by&#13;
September 1998; and (c) an Implementation Completion Report and a plan for operating the completed&#13;
project would be submitted by the Governments to IDA within six months of the closing date of the&#13;
project.&#13;
4.     Before Negotiations, draft PC- I s for the proposed project were prepared, reviewed to ensure that&#13;
they were satisfactory to IDA and approved by the NA, AJK and Federal Governments. Approval of the&#13;
proposed project PC- Is by ECNEC will be a condition of Credit Effectiveness.&#13;
B. Project Evaluation&#13;
5.    The proposed project will be monitored and evaluated from the perspectives of input, process,&#13;
output, and impact. Input evaluation will focus on whether the required resources are in place to&#13;
implement the program activities and services. Input information will be monitored and assessed&#13;
continuously (reported quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, depending on the specific input) to identify&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
ANNEX3&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
problems in the delivery of inputs so that they may be resolved before causing significant delays in&#13;
implementation. Process evaluation will examine the approaches used in training, service delivery and&#13;
community participation, attempt to explain variations in levels of performance for comparable project&#13;
inputs, and derive suggestions for improved approaches. This type of evaluation will be undertaken&#13;
quarterly or semi-annually (depending on the specific process). Input and process indicators will be the&#13;
primary indicators used for continuous monitoring and subsequent "fine-tuning."&#13;
6.     Output evaluation will focus on the immediate results of activities, as demonstrated, for example,&#13;
in MCH service utilization or contraceptive prevalence. This evaluation will be undertaken annually or&#13;
semi-annually (depending on the specific output indicator). Impact evaluation will focus on program&#13;
outcomes in terms of the region's long-term health sector goals. This evaluation will review the&#13;
program's effects on the infant mortality rate (IMR) and maternal mortality ratio (MMR) to ensure that&#13;
program implementation is in fact improving the health status of beneficiaries.&#13;
7.     The respective Governments, with supporting inputs from NGOs and local consultants, will be&#13;
responsible for routine monitoring and periodic evaluations. The Project Launch Workshop will include&#13;
one day of specific training in monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
8.     Baseline surveys to supplement other data sources, will be conducted in each region. Terms of&#13;
reference for research studies used for evaluation will be reviewed and agreed upon with IDA.&#13;
Evaluations will be undertaken by using sample surveys, supervisory visits, review of audit/evaluation&#13;
reports, the management information system and drawing upon data already collected by other agencies.&#13;
An important independent source of information outside the departmental statistics system is the&#13;
Pakistan Integrated Household Survey (PIHS), undertaken annually in order to monitor all SAP&#13;
components. Technical assistance, mainly from local institutions, is included to support these activities.&#13;
C. IDA Supervision Requirements&#13;
9.    The remoteness of these regions means that standard supervision arrangements, particularly led&#13;
from headquarters, would not be feasible. Much of the responsibility will be taken by IDA's Resident&#13;
Mission in Pakistan and by local consultants. Nonetheless, program and project supervision will still be&#13;
conducted semi-annually, although a full mission will only be mounted annually -- typically in&#13;
April/May -- to coincide with the budget approval cycle. This mission will also undertake a full annual&#13;
review of program performance and seek to finalize the annual operational plans, including the reform&#13;
programs and budgets. The semi-annual missions will coincide with their counterpart SAP supervision&#13;
missions. Local consultants to be financed under the IDA Credit will assist in supervising and evaluating&#13;
the program, and will be responsible for most of the routine supervision especially during the&#13;
October/November missions. IDA's Resident Mission in Pakistan will take the lead in overall program&#13;
and project monitoring on behalf of IDA. Cooperating donors will participate in missions and otherwise&#13;
contribute to overall monitoring and supervision.&#13;
10.   Table I (see next page) summarizes field supervision needs. These inputs are in addition to&#13;
regular supervision needs for the review of progress reports, procurement, supervision report preparation&#13;
and correspondence (which are estimated at six staff weeks per year throughout project implementation).&#13;

5/00          Final supervision mission/Implementation Completion Report mission  6&#13;
11.    Annual supervision missions will: (a) require at least two weeks in the field, (b) require the&#13;
services of specialists in public health, training, management, and finance; and (c) review progress of&#13;
program components and procurement, financial statements and disbursements, loan covenants, and the&#13;
implementation of technical assistance. Specialized skill requirements will be added to the missions&#13;
according to needs identified by previous supervision missions and will concentrate on: maternal and&#13;
child health, logistics, and monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
D. Program Performance Indicators&#13;
12.    The performance indicators will measure progress toward program and project objectives. A&#13;
summary of performance indicators for the proposed project is provided in Table 2; the more detailed&#13;
lists of performance indicators, prepared separately by NA &amp; AJK Governments, are included in the&#13;
implementation plan. The summary table, which arranges the indicators by the component with which&#13;
each is associated, presents one indicator of each type (inputs, process, outcome and impact) for each&#13;
component to the extent possible. While impact and output indicators will measure the progress made&#13;
over the life of the project, input and progress indicators will be used continuously to monitor&#13;
performance and revise implementation procedures as necessary. In the table, the two components&#13;
Strengthening community and NGO participation and Strengthening government health services have&#13;
been combined to simplify the presentation of objectives. These indicators will assist managers in&#13;
monitoring progress and achievements of the proposed program and project as well as for SAP-related&#13;
purposes.&#13;
13.   The table represents a minimum set of indicators which can be monitored with information&#13;
generated by the existing service statistics system, the baseline and other ongoing sample surveys,&#13;
operations research activities, and the results of the Pakistan Integrated Household Survey. Each district&#13;
will identify additional locally specific indicators which will be monitored regularly at the district or&#13;
service delivery level. Rapid assessment techniques will also be used. Since managerial information&#13;
needs will change as the program evolves, the indicators menu can and should be adapted; changes will&#13;
be proposed at the time of preparing the annual plans.&#13;
14.    The DOHs will develop detailed guidelines for tracking and performance-monitoring at district-&#13;
level and below. The guidelines will be designed so that the reporting burden is minimized. Technical&#13;
assistance will be provided by local consultants, financed by the IDA Credit.&#13;

AZAD GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE OFJAMMU AND) KASHMIR&#13;
INTRODUCTION.&#13;
1.     Numerous HealLh Assembly resolutionis have reaffirmed that health is a basic&#13;
human right and a worldwide social goal; and that is to be attained by all&#13;
people by the year 2000, a level that will permil them to lead a socially and&#13;
economically productive life.&#13;
2.     An acceptable level of health cannot be achieved by thc health sector alone. It&#13;
can only be attained through national poliiical will and the coordinated efforts&#13;
of the health sector and relcvarn activities of other social and economic&#13;
developrnent sectors. In this way stratcgies for the health and social and&#13;
economic sectors will be mutually supporLive, and together contribute to the&#13;
ultimate goals of the society.&#13;
3.     There is political comunitmenit at the highest ofricial level for achieving the&#13;
goal of health for all by die year 2000 in the Azad State of Jammu and Kashmir&#13;
In ordcr to build a healthy, confident nation, full of vigour and vitality, ready to&#13;
take on the challenges that lie ahead.&#13;
4.      Health policy of the Azad Govcrnment of State of Jammu and Kashmir Is an&#13;
expression of goals for improving the health siltuatiop, the priorities among&#13;
thoac goals, and the main directions for attaining them. lt Is based on the&#13;
following five sets of recommendationis of thc Declaration of Alma-Ata&#13;
(WHO. 1978) and subsequent thinking:-&#13;
a.     lealth services should bc effective, cMclent, affordable and&#13;
acceptable;&#13;
b.     Efforts to deal with health should Include disease prcvention, health&#13;
promotion, and curative and rehabilitative services;&#13;
c.     There should be universal coverage with hcalth services;&#13;
d.     lndividuals and comniunities should participate in health activities&#13;
that promote sclf reliance and reduce dependence; and&#13;
e.     Health activities should be integral to community and national&#13;
development.&#13;
The Healdt Policy will rectify the priority areas in the short term which are&#13;
idontifled in subsequent part of the policy and in the long temi autempts to provide&#13;
comprehonsive health car.&#13;

CURRENT SITUATION.&#13;
7.     Current healIh situation in the Azad State ol Jamrnu and Kashmir is&#13;
summarized blew:&#13;
- Life expectancy at birth.                   60 Years&#13;
- Crude birth rate.                           3,9%&#13;
- Crude death rate.                           12.&#13;
- Population growth ratc.                     2.7%&#13;
- Infant mortality rate.                      90/1000 live births.&#13;
- Under 5 mormlity rate.                      J80/1000&#13;
* Matemal mortality rate.                     6-711000&#13;
- Newborns with birth weighit of aticast 2500 g  70%&#13;
- Infants fully immunized.                    58%&#13;
- Women immunized during pregnancy with TT    16%&#13;
- Population with safc drinking water.        46% rural&#13;
76% urban&#13;
- Population with adequate excrcta disposal&#13;
facilities.                                  38.1%&#13;
- Adult literacy rate.                        43%&#13;
- Total Govi spending on health.              6.9%&#13;
8.     The literacy rate in AJK is 43% with female litcracy rate at only 12%, but&#13;
almost all children are in primary school. lHealth slandards are still poor. The matemal&#13;
mortality rate is 600-700 per 100,000 live births, and child mortality is 130 per&#13;
thousand live births. Immunization covcrage is 92 perccnt and the population / hospital&#13;
bed ratio of 1900 is worse than the national average of 1,600. Due to thc difficult terrain&#13;
and severc weather conditions during winicr and heavy rainfall in summcr, the primitive&#13;
communication system breaks down, making it difficult for pcople to obtain health care&#13;
from static facilities. About 25% of the disease burden is due to respiratory infections,&#13;
and TB is more provalent than in die rest or the country. Leprosy is still a public hcalkh&#13;
problem, iodine deficiency disorders are endemic and anaemia is common. Due to the&#13;
poor back up services and primitive communications, Tnaten)al mortality is higher than&#13;
the national avcrage; similarly, htality among accident victims Is common.&#13;
9.     AJK, has over 500 PHC facilitics ranging from Rural Health Centres to First&#13;
Aid Posts. Refenral services are weak and outreach services arc limited with the difficult&#13;
geography, providing services is expensive on a per capita basis. Almost all sanctioned&#13;
staff positions are filled , but many facilities have no MCII services. Anned Forces&#13;
provide some staff, drugs and medicines worth in all about Rs. 50 Million annually.&#13;
Demand far exceeds the highly inadequate supply for FP services, although the FPAP&#13;
operates actively throughout the State Apart from FP and leprosy and 1TB control , few&#13;
NGOs arc active in AJK. Comnmunity involvemeni, die privatc sector , and traditional&#13;
medicines are limited.&#13;
10.    There is an urgent need to affect a fundamental change in basic philosophy&#13;
and adopt a new approach. For any real and meaningfuil devclopnient in the health&#13;
status, improvements in health services dcliveiy system, safe water supply, sanitation&#13;
and nutrition are needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 5 of 14&#13;
11.     At present major problems faced by tie health sector are as follows:&#13;
Deficient midwifery services especially in primary health care. Existing services not&#13;
operated at a reasonablc level. The staff is not adequate, sanctioned positions for&#13;
female cadres aTc not there, drugs anid medicines are not sufficienl. Thcre  are&#13;
not enough funds to meet operating costs of vehicles/ ambulances and&#13;
supervisory functions especially due to terrain first referral level services arc&#13;
remote and deficicnt in emergency care to handle obstetric emergencics and&#13;
ccident emergencies. Inservicc staff can not bc abreast with scientific&#13;
development because there is hardly any continuous training programme. Pre-&#13;
service training programme are not geared to the nceds or the people but are&#13;
justified for the requirement of the job positions. Management is centralized and&#13;
very little community participation.&#13;

STRATEGIES.&#13;
15.    The Govermment's strategy is to remedy the problems stated earlier and focus&#13;
on improving the quality and coverage of primay health care while keeping a strong&#13;
MCH focus. The emphasis would be on sirengthening and upgrading facilities rather&#13;
than construction of additional facilities. In the short run, existing extensive stock of&#13;
health facilities will be brought upto a proper standard by the turn of the century, fully&#13;
staffed and equipped anid provided an adequate budget for medicines and other&#13;
operating expenises besides recently completed non operative facilities made fully&#13;
functional In the long run emphasis would be to improve the primary and reforral&#13;
services and rcmove the imbalances in various categories of trained human resource.&#13;
Steps will be taken for substantial community involvement In health care delivery and&#13;
creating a partnership between communities, NGOs and the Government which would&#13;
promote service delivery effectivcness and sustainabiliry.&#13;
[)Primary Health Care In rural areas.&#13;
In addition to the existing system of providing PHC at BHUs and RHCs, a programme&#13;
of female NHWs introduced to disseminate PI IC to the community will be expanded to&#13;
include the entire State. The femalc NHWs, selected by the communities will be trained&#13;
and equipped adequately. They will act as a bridge bclween the community and the&#13;
health units. BHUs/RHCs will become an integral part of the programme. It is proposed&#13;
to train one female NHIW for each census village.&#13;
ii) Primary Health Care In urban areas&#13;
In addition to hospitals. PHC in all urban localities will be provided by training of&#13;
female NHWs in each ward represented by City Fathers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

both to assumc rcsponsibility and accountability for managing thc outcome of investmcnts&#13;
in the provision of health services. Therefore, this policy aims at establishing lHealth&#13;
Committees at village, Union Council, Tehsil and District Icvcls. 1These committees will be&#13;
responsible ror advising, implementing and monitoring healtkh programmes. The&#13;
par ricipation of NGOs will be encouraged especially of Maric Adelaide Leprosy Centre and&#13;
[IAP while other NGOs will be supported to reduce the burden on the public purse.&#13;
xl)Intcrsecloral collaboration.&#13;
Efforts will be made to develop an integrated mcchanism which would make the&#13;
prinary health care approach a continuing reality in Education, Agriculture,&#13;
Sanitation, Women's and youth organizations. In this regard, a package of services to&#13;
meet Basic Minimum Needs will be adoptcd as is partly bcing done under Social Action&#13;
Programme.&#13;

Annex 7&#13;
Page 11 of 14&#13;
xiv)Communicable Disease Control (CDC).&#13;
CDC programs will be merged into a broad-based CDC program to follow a&#13;
health care approach in contrast to singic multi-purpose indepcndent programs&#13;
which thrive at the cosL of primary hcalth care programs. This will improve&#13;
efficiency by involving the communiity and local health manager and provides&#13;
service as a component of PHC through existing health care facilities. At the&#13;
comnmunity level, National Heath Workers will provide promotivo and&#13;
prevcntive services in addition to matenity and family planning services. Each&#13;
BIHU will have two CDC workers: One to be available at the facility and the&#13;
second to provide outreach services and support NJIWs. The RHCs will have&#13;
adequate staff from the exisilng vertical programs to provide scrvices fbr the&#13;
CDC program and laboratory services. The District llealth Ofircer will be&#13;
assisted by the CDC officcr to be made availMblc by redesignating existing&#13;
staff. At the Directorate level, an Importait section of the CDC program will&#13;
be created by mncrging existing vcrtical program  staff and adding some&#13;
additional staff. MOH is co-financing CDC programs nationwide. Tbe Federal&#13;
Ministry of Health (MOH) will provide equipment transport, vaccines,&#13;
reagents cold chain cquipment and insecticides for malaria control, EPI and&#13;
AIDS activities. These programs will be suppoited by the Social Action&#13;
Programme.&#13;

            The goal of the Northern Health Program
            Project is to support the government's programs in
            Northern areas and Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir to improve the
            health status of the population throughout all districts,
            with a specific target of reducing infant and maternal
            mortality by about 30 percent over a four year period.
            Improved health status will result from achieving the
            following four objectives: 1) improving quality and
            sustainability of primary health care, including preventive
            measures; 2) increasing cost-effectiveness and coverage of
            government health and family planning services; 3)
            strengthening the capacity of the health sector; and 4)
            building institutional capacity. The project will comprise
            four main components: 1) strengthening of community and
            nongovernmental organization participation; 2) strengthening
            government health services; 3) human resource development;
            and 4) management and organizational development.
