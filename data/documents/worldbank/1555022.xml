TRADE IN NON-FACTOR SERVICES: PAST TRENDS AND CURRENT ISSUES&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report, 1980&#13;
Although the emerging interest in trade in services has resulted in&#13;
some studies, research on trade in non-factor services (NFS) has been largely&#13;
neglected. This is because of problems with the data and the diversity of&#13;
NFS--they are heterogeneous collection of items usually classified according&#13;
to five categories: shipping, other transportation, travel, other private&#13;
services and other government services. In 1975, these items accounted for&#13;
about 20 percent of world trade in goods and NFS.&#13;
This paper represents the first stage of a research project on trade&#13;
in non-factor services. It (a) presents and analyzes the available data&#13;
on trade in non-factor services; (b) formulates a series of preliminary&#13;
hypotheses on the factors affecting NFS trade and presents the results of&#13;
econometric analyses which can be used for projections in the global model for&#13;
the World Development Report; (c) discusses the impediments to NFS trade as&#13;
seen by both developed and developing countries; and (d) sets out issues which&#13;
might be analyzed in the next stage of the project.&#13;
We have greatly benefitted from discussions with a number of colleagues,&#13;
including, iniparticular, Nancy Adams, Robert Baldwin, Francis Colaio, Harald&#13;
Hansen, Rachel McCulloch, James Riedel, Jo Saxe, Antoine Schwartz, James&#13;
Simmons, Martin Wolf and John Zerby. However, they are in no way responsible&#13;
for any of the shortcomings of this paper.   We would like to express our&#13;
appreciation to Angelito Santos for providing excellent research assistance&#13;
and to May-O Kuo for the efficient typing.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.   Background&#13;
During the last decade, the traditional focus on trade of merchan-&#13;
dise slowly began to give way to a more comprehensive approach which dealt&#13;
with services as well as goods. In part this shift arose from a belief that&#13;
more attention would be paid to trade in services in the future as a result&#13;
of recent achievements in the field of merchandise trade. Limits to distor-&#13;
tions in that area were accomplished by participants to the General Agreement&#13;
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 1/ While attempts to introduce the issue of&#13;
trade in services in the recent Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotia-&#13;
tions were largely unsuccessful, the even more recent fifth session of the&#13;
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) did adopt a series&#13;
of resolutions dealing with services.&#13;
Although the emerging interest in trade in services has resulted&#13;
in some studies, 2/ research on trade in non-factor services (NFS) has been&#13;
largely neglected. This is because of problems with the data and the diver-&#13;
sity of NFS--they are heterogeneous collection of items, usually classified&#13;
1/   See, for instance, recent papers by Robert E. Baldwin, "The Multilateral&#13;
Trade Negotiations: Toward Greater Liberalization?", 1979, American&#13;
Enterprise Institute, Washington, D.C. and Beyond the Tokyo Round Nego-&#13;
tiations, Trade Policy Research Centre, London, 1979; Ria Kemper, "The&#13;
Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations: Results and Implications&#13;
for Developing Countries," EPDIT Working Paper No. 9, October 1979, and&#13;
Bela Balassa, The Tokyo Round and the Developing Countries, Journal of&#13;
World Trade Law, forthcoming.&#13;
2/   In particular, see B. Griffiths, Invisible Barriers to Invisible Trade,&#13;
London: Macmillan, 1975, and US Department of Commerce, US Service&#13;
Industries in World Markets: Current Problems and Future Policy Devel-&#13;
opments, Washington, D.C. 1976.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

according to five categories: shipping, 1/ other transportation, travel,&#13;
other private services and other government services. 2/&#13;
In 1975, NFS constituted about 20 percent of world trade in goods&#13;
and NFS, although their importance varied widely among different regions. For&#13;
example, on the export side, the ratio between NFS and merchandise trade in&#13;
Southern Europe was over 40 percent, while in the Middle East it was below 10&#13;
percent. In terms of the composition of NFS exports by region, it appears&#13;
that "other private services" have consistently occupied the dominant position&#13;
in industrialized countries. Among the less developed countries, "travel&#13;
services" have played a major role in Latin America and Southern Europe, while&#13;
in most other regions, "other private services" has become the largest item,&#13;
following some shifts in the composition of NFS trade that have taken place&#13;
since 1967.&#13;
Protectionism in trade in non-factor services has become an impor-&#13;
tant policy issue. Restrictions are many. They include travel taxes, prefer-&#13;
ential bilateral shipping agreements, discriminatory taxes on foreign insur-&#13;
ance companies and banks, restrictions on remittances from royalties, and a&#13;
large variety of other such nontariff measures. Often, because of their&#13;
importance to the balance of payments, non-factor services have been a con-&#13;
venient target of commercial policies aimed at countering short-term diffi-&#13;
culties.&#13;
1/   Throughout this paper the term shipping is used interchangeably with&#13;
shipment.&#13;
2/   See Annex I for a more detailed discussion of the concepts and defini-&#13;
tions of NFS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
An important question is whether protectionism in services has been&#13;
increasing in recent years. While it is difficult to give clear-cut answers&#13;
and quantify protectionist measures of a non-tariff nature, this work leads&#13;
us to think that this has been the case. A possible explanation is the fact&#13;
that agreements have been concluded in the area of merchandise trade and that&#13;
some governments have moved their discriminatory measures into the yet unregu-&#13;
lated area of trade in services.&#13;
As compared to merchandise trade, the potential for restrictions&#13;
by developed countries against NFS imports from less developed nations is&#13;
limited because of the nature of the NFS components. The bulk of the bar-&#13;
riers to NFS trade have been imposed by the less developed countries them-&#13;
selves.&#13;
2.   The Purpose and Approach of the Study&#13;
This paper is a status report on the first phase of a research&#13;
project into trade in non-factor services being conducted with the Interna-&#13;
tional Trade and Capital Flows Division in the Economic Analysis and Projec-&#13;
tions Department (EPDIT) of the World Bank. The objectives of this phase&#13;
of research were data collection, exploratory analyses designed to highlight&#13;
issues for further examination, and development of a methodology for NFS&#13;
projections for the World Development Report.&#13;
In addressing the subject of NFS, two approaches were possible --&#13;
one broad, but rather superficial, the other specific and detailed, focusing&#13;
on one category of NFS. Because the results were to be integrated into a&#13;
larger study on trade patterns and problems, the first alternative was chosen.&#13;
This type of general approach was necessary as an exploratory step in this&#13;
largely ignored area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The paper is divided into three chapters. As an introduction to&#13;
the discussion, Chapter I presents and analyzes our data base. Based on&#13;
this analysis, in Chapter II, a series of hypotheses are formulated concern-&#13;
ing the determinants of some categories of NFS trade and tested by means of&#13;
econometric estimation. Although the econometric work is primarily aimed at&#13;
helping our understanding of the patterns of trade in non-factor services,&#13;
it is also used for projecting this trade in a manner consistent with the&#13;
requirements of the global analysis for the World Development Report. Chapter&#13;
III discusses the impediments to NFS trade, both from the viewpoint of the&#13;
industrialized and developing nations. Finally, some concluding remarks are&#13;
offered, including a series of issues identified for further investigation.&#13;
Definitions and background data are contained in four annexes.&#13;

CHAPTER I&#13;
DATA ANALYSIS&#13;
The historical analysis prqsented in this chapter is based entirely&#13;
on a data set derived from various issues of the Balance of Payments Yearbook&#13;
by the International Monetary Fund. They exclude a number of non-member coun-&#13;
tries, most notably the centrally planned economies. 1/ An attempt was made&#13;
to include as many other countries as possible; a list of these appears in&#13;
Table 1, Annex I. To simplify the reporting, the countries were grouped&#13;
according to the 15 regions used by the World Bank in its World Development&#13;
Report Series. Regions 1-12 are developing countries, 13-14 industrialized&#13;
nations. (Region 15 -- Centrally Planned Economies -- was excluded because&#13;
no data are available.) The time frame of the study was limited to the period&#13;
1967-1975 because the data for other years was unavailable or incomplete.&#13;
Because the IMF does not include a number of countries in its data,&#13;
what it calls "world-total" trade figures fail to produce a balance between&#13;
credit and debit. Further, the information contained in the Balance of Pay-&#13;
ments Yearbook, 1971-1977, Supplement to Volume 29, December 1978, indicates&#13;
an additional statistical problem specific to trade in non-factor services.&#13;
It can be detected in the following trade figures (in billions of SDRs), for&#13;
1975 for the world as a whole: 2/&#13;
1/   Also missing are, among others, Afghanistan, Angola, Hong Kong, Kuwait,&#13;
Lebanon, Liberia and Portugal.&#13;
2/   "World" is defined as the total of those countries which are members of&#13;
the IMF and for which data are available.&#13;

The figures reveal a rather large statistical discrepancy for NFS,&#13;
in particular for shipping (freight plus merchandise insurance). It seems&#13;
doubtful that the gap can be attributed entirely to the absence of data from&#13;
a few countrieso This lack of consistency in the data base is a constant&#13;
problem in the general area of trade in invisibles. One consequence is that&#13;
in general it is difficult to make clear statements about the surplus or&#13;
deficit status in the NFS balance of certain regions or countries. Although&#13;
some attempts to remedy this situation were undertaken in this work, the&#13;
problem remains largely unsolved.&#13;
2.   Historical Analysis&#13;
Table 1 indicates that, on the average, exports (imports) of NFS&#13;
represent about 20 percent of total exports (imports) of goods and NFS in the&#13;
14 regions. Thus, trade in NFS amounts to about a quarter of the trade in&#13;
goods. These proportions seem to have remained fairly stable between 1967 and&#13;
1975.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
The importance of NFS trade varies widely among the 14 regions. On&#13;
the export side, in 1975, Southern Europe (region 12) had by far the largest&#13;
ratio of trade in NFS to goods, followed by Singapore (region 9). At the&#13;
other end of the spectrum, two of the Middle Eastern/ North African regions&#13;
(5 and 6) had ratios below 10 percent. On the import side, two of the African&#13;
regions South of the Sahara (1 and 2), along with the OPEC surplus countries&#13;
(region 6), had high ratios, while Singapore's was on the order of 10 per-&#13;
cent. Globally, these ratios had similar orders of magnitude for developed&#13;
and developing countries. Underlying the ratios and their changes over time&#13;
were the growth rates for goods (including NFS) and of NFS for both exports&#13;
and imports; these are shown in Table 2, Annex I.&#13;
When the composition of NFS exports by region is examined (Table 2),&#13;
it can be observed that "other private services" have consistently occupied&#13;
the dominant position in industrialized nations. Among the developing coun-&#13;
tries, "travel" services have been predominant in Latin America and Southern&#13;
Europe (regions 10, 11, and 12), to be expected as they are nearest the big&#13;
travel spenders, i.e., the industrialized countries (regions 13 and 14). In&#13;
the other developing regions, the composition of earnings changed during the&#13;
period 1967-1975. There was a shift away from "other government services" in&#13;
low income Africa (region 1) and in Asia (regions 7, 8 and 9) and away from.&#13;
"travel" in North Africa and the Middle East (regions 5 and 6), and a shift&#13;
toward "other private services," mainly in two African regions and Asia. In&#13;
1975, in 9 of the 14 regions, "other private services" were first among the&#13;
NFS items; they were second in 4 other regions. Only in region 6 (Libya and&#13;
Saudi Arabia) has this item been insignificant during the entire period.&#13;

Rather different types of items accounted for the exports of "other&#13;
private services" in developing and developed countries. In the latter, the&#13;
main components were usually insurance and banking services, construction and&#13;
engineering services, or fees and royalties from affiliated foreign companies&#13;
(the latter were the main ones in the US). In less developed countries the&#13;
principal item has been earnings of residents working abroad temporarily; in&#13;
some cases, this item included large amounts normally classified as unrequited&#13;
transfers. Nevertheless, some developing countries have succeeded in earning&#13;
appreciable foreign exchange from the export of other services. This has been&#13;
the case, for example, in India, Korea and Singapore, which became major ex-&#13;
porters of construction/engineering 1/ and consultancy services, in particular&#13;
to the Middle East.&#13;
As far as the composition of NFS imports is concerned, Table 3,&#13;
Annex I, indicates relatively balanced and stable distribution among the five&#13;
NFS categories in industrialized countries. However, "other private services"&#13;
and "travel" have tended to occupy a slightly more dominant position in Western&#13;
Europe (region 13). For North America, Japan and Oceania (region 14), "other&#13;
government services," which constituted the major category in 1967, dropped&#13;
to last position in 1975 because of a slowdown in US overseas military expendi-&#13;
tures in the post-Vietnam era.&#13;
1/   In a recent article on Yugoslav building activities abroad, it was noted&#13;
that they have had a substantial impact on the country's balance of pay-&#13;
ments. However, the article also emphasized that in almost all cases,&#13;
project design documents were prepared by foreign (non-Yugoslav) design&#13;
firms, with the result that engineering services represented only 2 per-&#13;
cent of total building earnings from abroad. See S. Vukcevic, "Yugoslav&#13;
Building Organizations Abroad, 1966-1977," Yugoslav Survey, August 1978.&#13;

In the case of the developing countries, "shipping" was the major&#13;
import category for 8 out of 12 regions in 1975. The other major item has&#13;
quite often been "other private services," mostly in the form of copyright&#13;
and patent royalties, insurance services and various contractors' fees and&#13;
fees for technical advisory services - this last prevailing in oil-producing&#13;
countries.&#13;
. Tables 4 and 5, Annex I, give the growth rates of NFS export and&#13;
import components respectively for the period 1967-1975 and the sub-periods&#13;
1967-1971 and 1971-1975. In shipping exports, the fastest growing countries&#13;
between 1971 and 1975 were Iran and Iraq (region 5) and Singapore (region 9).&#13;
On the other hand, shipping imports for the whole period of analysis have&#13;
grown at a particularly rapid pace in the oil-exporting countries in North&#13;
Africa and the Middle East (regions 4, 5 and 6). At the same time, these&#13;
countries have benefitted from a rapid expansion of their exports of "other&#13;
transportation" services, mostly in the form of port services. The oil-pro-&#13;
ducing countries in the Middle East have also rapidly increased their imports&#13;
of "other transportation" services, mainly airline services. With respect to&#13;
"travel," exports of the OPEC surplus countries, Singapore and, interestingly,&#13;
low income Asia (regions 6, 9 and 7) have grown at an annual rate of roughly&#13;
30 percent between 1967 and 1975. The fastest growing importing countries&#13;
have been Iran and Iraq, and Singapore (regions 5 and 9, respectively),&#13;
which also have the largest growth rates for both exports and imports of&#13;
"other private services." Finally, "other government services" exports and&#13;
imports have been growing relatively slowly in most regions, with the excep-&#13;
tion.of the Middle Eastern oil-exporting regions (5 and 6) and middle income&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Africa south of the Sahara (region 2).   The two former regions and Singapore&#13;
(region 9), have led, as far as NFS import and export growth rates are con-&#13;
cerned, during the period 1967-1975 (see Annex I, Table 2).&#13;
The above analysis is based exclusively on balance of payments data,&#13;
which are available only at current prices. An attempt was made to provide&#13;
estimates of trade in NFS at constant prices by constructing a series of&#13;
deflators. Since these deflators are not found in the literature, 1/ they&#13;
are described here briefly. 2/&#13;
Specific ones were constructed for each of the five NFS categories.&#13;
As deflators for "shipping," price indices for tankers, bulk carriers and&#13;
liners (Table 28, Annex I) were used. These three indices were combined into&#13;
a single index of shipping exports (imports) for each region, using as weights&#13;
the 1975 value shares of the three corresponding merchandise categories ex-&#13;
ported (imported) by each region. The three categories are: fuels, assumed&#13;
to be carried by tankers; metals, minerals, grains and 20 percent of non-food&#13;
agricultural products, assumed to be transported by bulk carriers; and all&#13;
food categories (excluding grains), 80 percent of non-food agricultural prod-&#13;
ucts, and manufactured products, assumed to be carried by liners. The result-&#13;
ing export/import deflators are shown in Tables 26 and 27, Annex I, respec-&#13;
tively. No regional distinction was attempted for "other transportation." In&#13;
that category, a single deflator was used for both exports and imports, based&#13;
1/   The methodology is inspired, in part, by Marian Bond's paper, "The World&#13;
Trade Model: Invisibles," International M4onetary Fund Staff Papers, Vol.&#13;
26, No. 2, June 1979, pp. 257-333.&#13;
2/   Since it was necessary to make some rough assumptions, the deflators pre-&#13;
sented should be used with some caution.&#13;

on the index of gross revenue per passenger kilometer on scheduled airlines&#13;
as reported by the International Civil Aviation Organization (see Table 30,&#13;
Annex I). While the price index for "travel" exports for a particular region&#13;
is likely to be connected to its consumer price index, the latter was not&#13;
available for the WDR regions, and instead implicit GDP deflators were used&#13;
to deflate exports of tourism (see Table 31, Annex I). For "travel" imports,&#13;
the price index was also based on regional GDP deflators which, for each&#13;
region, were combined by using as weights the share of that regions' tourist&#13;
expenditures spent in the 14 regions 1/ (see Table 29, Annex I). Finally,&#13;
with respect to imports of "other private services" and "other government&#13;
services," the OECD GDP deflator was used for all regions under the assump-&#13;
tion that most of these imports were provided by the industrialized nations.&#13;
Exports in these two categories were deflated for each region by its own GDP&#13;
deflator.&#13;
NFS exports and imports at constant prices are reproduced in Tables&#13;
11-16 and 18-23 in Annex I. The overall NFS price deflators for exports and&#13;
imports are shown in Tables 24 and 25, Annex I.&#13;
Table 3 of the text contains summaries of some of the major trends&#13;
in NFS trade. Even though country coverage is not complete and exports and&#13;
imports are not well-balanced at the global level, aggregates were made for&#13;
developed countries, less developed countries and the world. According to the&#13;
results shown in Table 3, world trade of NFS, at constant prices, increased&#13;
about 6 percent annually from 1967 to 1975, while prices increased about 10&#13;
percent.&#13;
1/ These shares were calculated from Table 4 of the text.&#13;

Some other summary indicators of NFS trade are given in Tables 6-9,&#13;
Annex I. For instance, Tables 6 and 7 show export and import growth rates&#13;
on a regional basis at both current and constant prices. Tables 8 and 9&#13;
(corresponding to Tables 4 and 5, Annex I) summarize the trends for the&#13;
various NFS components. It can be seen that for imports (Tables 5 and 9,&#13;
Annex I), the observations made for current values remain valid for constant&#13;
values. On the other hand, when exports are considered, a number of changes&#13;
appear. For instance, the two Latin American regions (10 and 11) seem to&#13;
have been suffering an overall reduction in their total exports of NFS when&#13;
measured at constant prices (Table 6, Annex I), with particular declines in&#13;
exports of "travel," "other private services" (low income Latin America only)&#13;
and "other government services" (Table 8). At current prices, these trends&#13;
are hidden behind high inflation rates. Exports of "other government ser-&#13;
vices" have been declining in nearly all developing regions, except for areas&#13;
in Africa and the Middle East (regions 2, 4 and 5). This development results&#13;
mainly from the decline in US military expenditures, shown under imports of&#13;
"other government services" of region 14 in Table 9.&#13;
In concluding this section, some of the tables in Annex I are exam-&#13;
ined, in order to determine which regions are the leading traders in NFS.&#13;
As already mentioned, there is a lack of consistency in the balance of pay-&#13;
ments data in the sense that aggregate figures fail to produce a balance&#13;
between exports and imports. Therefore, only gross trade figures are exam-&#13;
ined here (estimates of net trade are discussed in the next section). It&#13;

can be seen from Table 10 1/ that, in 1975, 2/ by far the largest exporters&#13;
of NFS were the industrialized regions, with Western Europe (region 13) far&#13;
ahead of North America and Oceania (region 14). 3/ Among the developing&#13;
countries, Southern Europe (region 12) and high income Latin America (region&#13;
11) were the leaders. 4/ A similar picture emerges for "shipping," "other&#13;
transportation," and "travel" (Tables 12-14). For "other private services"&#13;
(Table 15), Singapore (region 9) came in second among the developing coun-&#13;
tries, and for "other government services" (Table 16), the two largest devel-&#13;
oping country creditors were upper middle income North Africa and Middle East&#13;
(region 5) and middle income Asia and Pacific (region 8). 5/ Table 17 indi-&#13;
cates that the industrialized countries (regions 13 and 14) were also the&#13;
largest importers of NFS, 6/ with high income Latin America and Southern&#13;
Europe (regions 11 and 12) the largest among the developing nations. 7/ This&#13;
time, the picture is comparable only for "other transportation" and "travel"&#13;
(Tables 20 and 21). For "shipping" (Table 19), upper middle income North&#13;
Africa and Middle East (region 5) followed high income Latin America (region&#13;

Finally, for "other government services" (Table 23), North America and Oceania&#13;
(region 14) came ahead of Western Europe (region 13) among the industrial&#13;
countries, while the Middle East and North Africa (regions 6 and 5) were far&#13;
ahead among the less developed ones.&#13;
3.   Net Trade Positions&#13;
This brief section contains some indications of net NFS trade.&#13;
Given that both the amount of information available and the scope of this&#13;
study were very limited, it was not possible to derive figures for total NFS&#13;
trade.&#13;
From the data presented above, the only interregional conclusion&#13;
that can be drawn at the aggregate level is as follows. 2/ First, it is known&#13;
that developed countries import 70 percent and export 75 percent of the world&#13;
trade in NFS, the remainder being accounted for by developing nations. If it&#13;
is assumed that inter-developing country trade represents somewhere between 5&#13;
and 10 percent of world trade, it can be deduced that inter-developed country&#13;
trade accounts for 50 to 55 percent, developed country exports to developing&#13;
countries 20 to 25 percent, and developing to developed country exports 15 to&#13;
20 percent.&#13;
It was possible to construct some interesting tables for two compo-&#13;
nents of NFS -- travel and shipping. These are discussed below.&#13;
1/   This sudden appearance of region 2 is explained by Nigeria's oil-related&#13;
imports of expert services.&#13;
2/   Disregarding the absence of region 15 from the data, and the bias result-&#13;
ing from the inconsistency discussed earlier.&#13;

3.1 Travel&#13;
Table 4 of the text shows a matrix of travel expenditures and re-&#13;
ceipts by WDR region for 1975. It is the result of information from numerous&#13;
sources, 1/ pieced together with a large dose of judgement. Over 70 percent&#13;
of the world's tourist expenditures were made by industrialized nations (re-&#13;
gions 13 and 14), which also earned 65 percent of total receipts. Western&#13;
Europe alone accounted for around 50 percent of both expenditures and receipts.&#13;
High income Latin America (region 11) and Southern Europe (region 12) were&#13;
also major travel earners, essentially the result of their proximity to high&#13;
spenders, i.e., Western Europe and North America, respectively. Southern&#13;
Europe and high income Latin America received about 65 percent of the $14.3&#13;
billion earned by all developing countries in 1975. Some developing nations&#13;
also spent relatively large amounts on travel, in particular countries in high&#13;
income Latin America (mainly Mexico), Southern Europe and the Middle East&#13;
(regions 11, 12 and 5). Nevertheless, on balance, developing countries were&#13;
creditors, with net earnings of $5.2 billion. On the other hand, industrial-&#13;
ized countries had a deficit of $5.3 billion -- $1.5 billion for region 13 and&#13;
$3.8 billion for region 14. Finally, centrally planned economies (region 15)&#13;
had a small surplus of $0.1 billion.&#13;
3.2  Shipping&#13;
As already noted earlier, shipping is by far the least reliable item&#13;
in the balance of payments. The problem is largely the result of the wide-&#13;
spread practice of owners from developed market-economy countries registering&#13;
1/   IMF balance of payments figures, various OECD publications, the World&#13;
Tourist Organization publications, the Economist Intelligence Unit, and&#13;
information from the World Bank's Tourism Advisory Service.&#13;

their ships under "flags of convenience" in one of the six "open-registry"&#13;
countries -- Cyprus, Liberia, Oman, Panama, Singapore and Somalia. 1/ There&#13;
is no information which could be easily used to construct a matrix similar in&#13;
nature to that for travel. However, a step in that direction is taken here.&#13;
The world's maritime fleet is generally divided into three types&#13;
of vessels, each roughly specializing in the transport of certain categories&#13;
of commodities: 2/&#13;
Type of vessel 3/           Type of commodity generally carried&#13;
Tankers                     Fuels&#13;
Bulk carriers               Metals, minerals, grains and 20% of&#13;
non-food agricultural products&#13;
Liners                      Food items (excluding grains), 80%&#13;
of non-food agricultural products&#13;
and manufactures&#13;
What information is available, together with some judgement, were&#13;
used to construct two series of matrices. One deals with the tonnage carried&#13;
by each type of vessel, the other with the value of trade by corresponding&#13;
type of commodity.&#13;
Table 5 presents four aggregated matrices for world seaborne trade&#13;
in terms of quantity. As expected, most tankers have operated from developing&#13;
to developed countries. However, about 12 percent of their shipments have&#13;
been to fuel-importing developing countries, while shipments from centrally&#13;
1/   Several other aspects of trade in shipping services are also of great&#13;
interest, especially in the context of the North-South dialogue. A&#13;
section of Chapter III is devoted to them.&#13;
2/   These figures are estimates.&#13;
3/   We have not listed combined carriers separately but included them in&#13;
the three categories according to the commodity types they carry.&#13;

planned economies to Western Europe represented another 4 percent. Although&#13;
developing countries also supplied large quantities of the goods being trans-&#13;
ported by bulk carriers, inter-developed country shipments occupied the largest&#13;
tonnage on these vessels. This was, in large part, because of Japan's imports&#13;
of grains and raw materials from Australia, Canada and the US. Finally, it&#13;
can be seen that liners operated mostly among industrialized countries, re-&#13;
flecting the fact that they carry mainly manufactured goods. However, there&#13;
has been significant shipping from developing to developed countries (food&#13;
and non-food agricultural products) and from developed to developing nations&#13;
(manufactured goods). Inter-developing country shipments have been small.&#13;
Table 6 also presents four aggregated matrices, this time of trade&#13;
in merchandise measured in terms of value. 1/ These matrices include all&#13;
trade flows, regardless of their mode of transportation. They represent,&#13;
therefore, an overestimate of seaborne trade.&#13;
By and large, the three matrices in the upper part of the table&#13;
convey the same information as the first three matrices of Table 5. However,&#13;
there is a significant difference in the last matrix of these two tables,&#13;
which stems from the fact that 54 percent of the world seaborne tonnage has&#13;
been carried by tankers, as opposed to only 20 percent for liners, while in&#13;
terms of value, fuels have represented only 20 percent of world trade as&#13;
opposed to 73 percent for food minus grains, 80 percent of non-food agricul-&#13;
tural products, and manufactured items.&#13;

CHAPTER II&#13;
ECONOMETRIC ESTIMATES AND PROJECTIONS&#13;
In this chapter, the observations made earlier concerning the recent&#13;
trends in international trade in NFS are used to make a systematic analysis&#13;
of their determinants. To this end, an econometric model of the imports and&#13;
exports of the various components of NFS has been constructed.&#13;
In this study a cross-country data base was used, and the focus has&#13;
therefore been on long-run factors. This approach contrasts sharply with most&#13;
recent empirical studies, which have consisted of submodels of trade in in-&#13;
visibles designed to be incorporated into large national or international&#13;
econometric models. These time-series submodels are essentially short-run&#13;
and pertain to forecasting the contribution of transactions involving invisi-&#13;
bles to the balance of payments. An interesting contribution in this class&#13;
of work is the recent paper by Marian Bond 1/ which offers a world model of&#13;
flows in invisibles and contains a good bibliography on invisibles models.&#13;
This chapter is divided into three sections. The first formulates&#13;
disaggregated models of trade in the different NFS categories. The second&#13;
presents and discusses the empirical results obtained from fitting the models&#13;
to cross-country data. The final section consists of a projection exercise&#13;
aimed at improving the current methodology used in the World Development&#13;
Report to forecast NFS trade.&#13;
1.   The Models&#13;
1.1.      Shipping&#13;
The shipping item of the balance of payments contains three separate&#13;
components: freight transportation, merchandise insurance and other services.&#13;
1/   Op. cit.  Bond.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Given their relative importance, the discussion centers on freight transporta-&#13;
tion, and only a few comments are made about merchandise insurance. Moreover,&#13;
there was no attempt to distinguish these two items in the model itself.&#13;
Consider three countries: A, B and C. The balance of payments of&#13;
country A will indicate a receipt from freight transportation in either of the&#13;
following cases: (a) A exports commodities to B or C and its carriers are&#13;
used for transportation; or (b) B and C trade between themselves, and A's&#13;
carriers are used for transportation. If A were to import commodities from&#13;
B or C and use its own carriers, nothing would be recorded in its balance of&#13;
payments since, in fact, there would be no international transaction for&#13;
shipping services. A's balance of payments will indicate a payment for&#13;
freight transportation only in the case where it imports commodities from&#13;
either B or C and their carriers are used for transportation.&#13;
A country's receipts from freight transportation therefore depend&#13;
on its merchandise exports and, perhaps, on world trade, if the country is&#13;
involved in the carriage of freight on cross-trades, i.e., to and from third&#13;
countries. The country's payments for freight transportation similarly depend&#13;
upon its merchandise imports. It is postulated that these relationships hold&#13;
only to the extent that each country has the same fleet of carriers. Of&#13;
course, a country's receipts will be larger (for given merchandise exports)&#13;
the larger its operating fleet, while its payments will be larger (for given&#13;
merchandise imports) the smaller its operating fleet. An example of import&#13;
substitution in shipping services is Brazil where the increase in the fleet&#13;
size clearly had the effect of reducing debits in the balance of payments&#13;
account. As far as the size of the operating fleet is concerned, it has been&#13;
assumed in this analysis that it varies across countries in proportion to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
size of existing fleets. Therefore the issue of operating rates 1/ can be&#13;
disregarded.&#13;
The various hypotheses can be summarized as follows: 2/&#13;
SHC = SHC (EX,FLEET)                                    (1)&#13;
+ +&#13;
and&#13;
SHD = SHD (IM,FLEET)                                    (2)&#13;
+ _&#13;
where&#13;
SHC   = shipping (freight and insurance), credit (US$)&#13;
SHD   = shipping (freight and insurance), debit (US$)&#13;
EX    = exports of commodities (US$)&#13;
IM    = imports of commodities (US$)&#13;
FLEET = total merchant fleet registered in the country&#13;
(gross registered tonnage).&#13;
Note that equations (1) and (2) are applied to shipping, not just freight&#13;
transportation. This is permissible to the extent that merchandise insurance&#13;
transactions depend upon merchandise trade, and are basically proportional to&#13;
freight costs.&#13;
1.2.      Other Transportation&#13;
As noted in Annex I, the "other transportation" item of the balance&#13;
of payments consists of two components: passenger fares and port services.&#13;
Countries for which disaggregated data are available indicate that the two&#13;
items are roughly similar in size, and separate explanations are required&#13;
for each.&#13;
1/   The issue is greatly complicated by the fact that there are many types&#13;
of carriers, each corresponding more or less to a certain type of com-&#13;
modity, and that different countries have different fleet compositions&#13;
just as they have different trade compositions.&#13;
2/   Under each explanatory variable the sign of its postulated relationship&#13;
with the corresponding independent variable is indicated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
1.2.1.    Passenger Fares.&#13;
The passenger fares item is rather similar to freight transporta-&#13;
tion, with passengers replacing merchandise and air carriers replacing, in&#13;
most cases, maritime carriers. Therefore, a country's receipts from passenger&#13;
fares depend upon the flow of passengers to it and, perhaps, upon the world&#13;
flow of passengers, if the country is involved in transporting passengers to&#13;
and from third countries, as well as upon the country's fleet of airplanes.&#13;
Similarly, that country's payments for passenger fares are related to the flow&#13;
of its nationals going abroad and to its fleet.&#13;
Using a country's receipts from (payments for) travel as a proxy for&#13;
the flow of incoming foreign (outgoing national) passengers, it is possible to&#13;
write the following equations:&#13;
PFC    =  PFC(TRC,AIRF)                                 (3)&#13;
+ +&#13;
and&#13;
PFD    =  PFD(TRD,AIRF)                                 (4)&#13;
where&#13;
PFC    =  passenger fares, credit (US$),&#13;
PFD    =  passenger fares, debit (US$)&#13;
TRC    =  travel, credit (US$)&#13;
TRD    =   travel, debit (US$)&#13;
AIRF   =  number of airplanes registered in the&#13;
country and used for international flights.&#13;
1.2.2.    Port Services&#13;
The balance of payments of a country will indicate receipts from&#13;
port services if foreign carriers use the port facilities of and purchase&#13;
goods and services from the country. On the other hand, its balance of&#13;
payments will indicate a payment for port services if its carriers use for-&#13;
eign port facilities and purchase goods and services abroad.&#13;
Port services are provided for both air and maritime carriers.&#13;
However, few countries provide data which distinguish between them; where&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
they do, seaport services typically appear as much larger than airport ser-&#13;
vices. In the absence of disaggregated data and given the above indication,&#13;
port services have been treated as if they pertained solely to maritime&#13;
carriers.&#13;
A country's receipts from port services are postulated to be a func-&#13;
tion of the number and size of foreign carriers using its port facilities and&#13;
of the duration of use. An approximation of these factors is derived from the&#13;
country's total trade in commodities (exports plus imports), together with the&#13;
size of its maritime fleet. The assumption is that the larger a country's&#13;
foreign trade, the more foreign ships will use its port facilities 1/ for a&#13;
given fleet size; the larger its own fleet, the less use there is by foreign&#13;
vessels for a given value of foreign trade. In the same fashion, it can be&#13;
postulated that a country's payments for port services are a positive function&#13;
of both its total trade and the size of its fleet. These assumptions can be&#13;
formulated as follows:&#13;
PSC = PSC(EX + IM,FLEET)                                (5)&#13;
+_&#13;
and&#13;
PSD = PSD(EX + IM,FLEET)                                (6)&#13;
+      +&#13;
where&#13;
PSC   = post services, credit (US$)&#13;
PSD   = port services, debit (US$)&#13;
EX    = exports of commodities (US$)&#13;
IM    = imports of commodities (US$)&#13;
FLEET = total merchant fleet registered in the&#13;
country (grt).&#13;
1/   The duration of the stay in port depends not only on the value and volume&#13;
of goods loaded and/or unloaded, but also on the composition of the cargo&#13;
and on port congestion, which are ignored in this model.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
1.3.      Travel&#13;
It was observed earlier that the bulk of travel expenditures origi-&#13;
nated in rich countries. Therefore, it has been postulated that a country's&#13;
per capita payments for travel services depend upon its per capita income.&#13;
However, some authors 1/ have observed that countries with similar per capita&#13;
income levels may experience wide differences in their travel payments because&#13;
of differences in their area and geographic location. Indeed, the smaller&#13;
the country and the larger the number of its neighbors, the more likely it&#13;
is to have large per capita travel receipts.&#13;
Given that (a) rich countries are the world's major travel spenders,&#13;
and (b) that travelers from rich countries might be less inclined to go to&#13;
poorer countries and more inclined to seek comfort, it has also been postu-&#13;
lated that a country's receipts from travel services will be greater the&#13;
higher its per capita income. Further, it has been assumed that the cheaper&#13;
it is to get to a country from a rich (i.e., OECD-member) country, the more&#13;
likely it is the former will earn travel receipts.&#13;
In summary:&#13;
TRC/POP = TRC/POP(GNP/POP,FARE)                         (7)&#13;
+_&#13;
and&#13;
TRD/POP = TRD/POP(GNP/POP,AREA)                         (8)&#13;
+_&#13;
where&#13;
TRC = travel, credit (US$)&#13;
TRD = travel, debit (US$)&#13;
POP = population&#13;
GNP = gross national product (US$)&#13;
FARE = air or train fare between the country&#13;
and the nearest OECD-member country&#13;
(US$)&#13;
AREA = area of the country (sq. kilometers).&#13;

of the Service Sector: An International Comparison," Working Paper No.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

1.4.      Other Private Services&#13;
As may be recalled from the earlier discussion, the "other private&#13;
services" component of the balance of payments is a collection of items which&#13;
mostly correspond to services defined in terms of output. It is postulated&#13;
that a country's receipts from other private services depend upon both its&#13;
GNP and per capita GNP, reflecting the fact that the higher per capita GNP&#13;
countries tend to produce proportionally more services, especially of a&#13;
tradable type. On the other hand, a country's payments for other private&#13;
services will depend upon both its GNP and per capita GNP, since higher per&#13;
capita GNP countries are likely to consume relatively more tradable services.&#13;
Thus:&#13;
OPSC = OPSC(GNP,GNP/POP)                               (9)&#13;
+ +&#13;
and&#13;
OPSD = OPSD(GNP,GNP/POP)                              (10)&#13;
+     +&#13;
where&#13;
OPSC = other private services, credit (US$)&#13;
OPSD = other private services, debit (US$)&#13;
GNP = gross national product&#13;
POP = population.&#13;
1.5.      Other Government Services&#13;
It was seen earlier that the magnitude of trade in other government&#13;
services is very often a function of the size of military-related receipts&#13;
and expenditures, which can hardly be expected to respond to strictly economic&#13;
factors. Accordingly, it was decided to treat this item of the balance of&#13;
payments as exogenous.&#13;

2.        Empirical Results&#13;
The model for NFS, as given in equations (1)-(10), was tested with&#13;
cross-country data for the year 1975. Because of a lack of data, equations&#13;
(1)-(6) were estimated with a sample of only 24 countries, while the remaining&#13;
four equations were estimated with a sample of 44 countries. As can be seen&#13;
from the composition of both samples (see Table 1, Annex III), a roughly equal&#13;
number of developed and developing countries was included.&#13;
In order to simplify the interpretation of the regression results,&#13;
all the equations were estimated using a log-linear form. The results are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Shipping&#13;

R = 0.90&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

log (PSD) = -3.774 + 0.769 log (EX + IM) + 0.210 log (FLEET)        (6)'&#13;

log (OPSC) = -4.559 + 0.756 log (GNP) + 0.329 log (GNP/POP)         (9)'&#13;
(4-9.5)  (7.57)             (2.50)&#13;
R2 =   0.75&#13;
log (OPSD) = -2.590 + 0.659 log (GNP) + 0.236 log (GNP/POP)         (10)'&#13;
(3.44)   (8.09)             (2.19)&#13;
R2 =   0.76&#13;
The figures in parentheses are t-statistics, and R      is the percentage of&#13;
variance explained, corrected for degrees of freedom.&#13;
On the whole, the results are surprisingly good: all the esti-&#13;
mated coefficients have the expected sign, most of them are statistically&#13;
significant at the 5 or 10 percent level, and the average value of R       is 0.76.&#13;
Equations (1)'-(2)' and (5)'-(6)' indicate that, for given trade values, an&#13;
increase increase in a country's fleet of maritime carriers has a positive net&#13;
effect on the shipping and a negative effect on the port services accounts of&#13;
its balance of payments. The relatively low values of the t-statistic on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
coefficient of the variable FLEET in these four equations is probably caused&#13;
in part by a data problem. Indeed, the variable used in the model repre-&#13;
sents the total merchant fleet registered in a country, rather than the&#13;
fleet belonging to its residents, which would be a more appropriate indicator&#13;
of balance of payments receipts and payments. A problem of a similar nature&#13;
arises in equations (3)'-(4)' with the variable AIRF, which gives the number&#13;
of airplanes registered in a country and used for international flights,&#13;
rather than the number of seats available for international flights. However,&#13;
even with these caveats, both the FLEET and AIRF variables perform well.&#13;
Equation (7)' indicates an elasticity of per capita travel receipts&#13;
with respect to transportation costs equal to less than unity, but not signif-&#13;
icantly so. On the other hand, equation (8)' reveals that the elasticity of&#13;
travel expenditures with respect to income is significantly larger than unity.&#13;
Finally, equations (9)'-(10)' indicate, as expected, that where two countries&#13;
have similar GNPs, the richer one (in terms of per capita GNP) will do the&#13;
most trade in other private services.&#13;
3.   Projecting NFS Trade&#13;
To date, the method used in the World Development Report to forecast&#13;
NFS trade has consisted simply of applying past growth rates for total NFS&#13;
exports and imports. A great improvement can be achieved by employing the&#13;
equations in the previous section. However, some are not well-suited to fore-&#13;
casting because certain explanatory variables, such as FLEET or FARE, are&#13;
difficult to project. Since it is sufficient to project growth rates for the&#13;
NFS items, and since projected growth rates for the four explanatory variables&#13;
(merchandise exports and imports, GNP and per capita GNP) are readily avail-&#13;
able from the WDR exercise, there are two feasible solutions to the problem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
The first is to use equations (1)'-(10),' with the assumption that the ex-&#13;
planatory variables, except for the four just mentioned, will remain con-&#13;
stant over time. The other consists of reestimating the equations based&#13;
solely on the four explanatory variables.&#13;
The solution adopted lies somewhere between the above two. Table 7&#13;
presents the set of equations corresponding to it. The following three changes&#13;
were made:&#13;
-    the variable FLEET has been removed from (1)'-(2)';&#13;
-    equations (3)'-(5)', on the one hand, and (4)'-(6)',&#13;
on the other, have been combined and the variables&#13;
AIRF and FLEET removed;&#13;
-    the variable FARE in equation (7)' has been replaced&#13;
by a proximity dummy variable described in a foot-&#13;
note to Table 7.&#13;
Since all equations were again estimated in log-linear form, pro-&#13;
jected growth rates for the four endogenous NFS items (shipping, other trans-&#13;
portation, travel and other private services) were obtained by simply multi-&#13;
plying the estimated regression coefficients by the correspanding projected&#13;
explanatory variables. 1/ The growth rate for the "other government services"&#13;
item projected for 1975-80 was arbitrarily taken as one-half of the actual&#13;
rate for 1967-75. This rate was further cut by half for 1980-85, and again&#13;
by half for 1985-90. All the resulting projections are shown in Tables 2-13,&#13;
Annex III.&#13;
1/   See WDR II Base Case of June 28, 1979.   Note that for WDR III, signifi-&#13;
cant downward revisions of some growth rates of explanatory variables&#13;
were made.&#13;

CHAPTER III&#13;
PROTECTIONISM&#13;
Over the last three decades, the international community has&#13;
achieved substantial progress in liberalizing trade in goods. Relatively&#13;
little or no emphasis has been put on trade in NFS. However, this is not to&#13;
say they have not been affected by restrictions. Barriers to trade in NFS&#13;
have included travel taxes, bilateral shipping agreements, preferential&#13;
landing charges for national air carriers, discriminatory taxes on foreign&#13;
insurance companies and banks, quotas on foreign advertising and movies,&#13;
restrictions on royalties' remittances, and a large variety of other such&#13;
nontariff measures. In fact, because of their importance to the current&#13;
account of most countries' balances of payments and of their exclusion within&#13;
the GATT, NFS are often a convenient target of commercial policies aimed at&#13;
countering short-term balance of payments difficulties.&#13;
The horizon of this discussion on trade distortions has been&#13;
expanded beyond NFS alone because of the possibility of substitution between&#13;
trade and foreign investment in NFS, which enables the design of alternative&#13;
commercial policies aimed at a single objective. Indeed, consider the&#13;
instance of a London insurance company wanting to insure Egyptian residents.&#13;
In theory, it has a choice between exporting insurance services from Britain&#13;
or establishing a branch in Cairo. In the former case, there will be trade&#13;
in NFS, while in the latter the only international transaction likely to&#13;
take place is a flow of investment income into Britain as a result of its&#13;
ownership of capital assets in Egypt. On the other hand, the Egyptian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
government could narrow the choice of both the insurance company and its&#13;
Egyptian customers 1/ by deciding either to (1) restrict residents from&#13;
importing insurance services, i.e., from dealing with foreign companies&#13;
located abroad, (2) restrict foreign insurance companies from establishing&#13;
branches in Egypt, or (3) allow the establishment of foreign-controlled&#13;
companies, but either (a) restrict the size or scope of their operations,&#13;
or (b) restrict the outflow of their investment income. Measure (1) is a case&#13;
of a NFS barrier, while measure (3b) represents an investment income barrier.&#13;
Both are barriers to trade in services. Measures (2) and (3a) are restric-&#13;
tions on foreign investment. 2/ This example, in which an industrialized&#13;
country is attempting to export a service to a protectionist developing&#13;
nation, is quite common in the real world. However, barriers to trade in&#13;
services also hinder exports of less developed to industrialized countries, as&#13;
well as trade among either rich or poor nations. The discussion which follows&#13;
addresses principally the restrictions imposed on trade in services - NFS,&#13;
plus investment income - but also, to a lesser extent, barriers to foreign&#13;
investment in the services sector. In section 1, the barriers to trade&#13;
and investment in services are catalogued and analyzed, with a distinction&#13;
between industrialized and developing countries. It proves helpful in section&#13;
3, which looks at means of reducing the distortions, in particular through&#13;
international negotiations in policy forums such as the GATT, OECD or UNCTAD.&#13;
1/   Assuming that the government wished to allow any transactions between&#13;
residents and foreign insurance companies.&#13;
2/   The distinction between measures (2) and (3a) might, in fact, often be&#13;
purely a question of semantics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
Section 2 is devoted to shipping, singled out because of its special role in&#13;
the North-South confrontation and the attempts at creating a new international&#13;
economic order.&#13;
1. Analysis of Trade and Investment Restrictions&#13;
In his important volume on nontariff barriers to trade in physical&#13;
goods, Professor Baldwin 1/ divides the main types of nontariff trade-&#13;
distorting policies into 12 categories:&#13;
(1) quotas and restrictive state-trade policies;&#13;
(2)  export subsidies and taxes;&#13;
(3)  discriminatory government and private procurement&#13;
policies;&#13;
(4)  selective indirect taxes;&#13;
(5)  selective domestic subsidies and aids;&#13;
(6)  restrictive customs procedures;&#13;
(7)  antidumping regulations;&#13;
(8)  restrictive administrative and technical&#13;
regulations;&#13;
(9)  restrictive business practices;&#13;
(10) controls over foreign investment;&#13;
(11) restrictive immigration policies;&#13;
(12) selective monetary controls and discriminatory&#13;
exchange-rate policies.&#13;

D.C., Brookings Institute, 1970.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
The 11 categories other than restrictive customs procedures 1/ apply equally&#13;
well to services. However, for lack of information, antidumping regulations&#13;
and restrictive business practices are omitted from our consideration.&#13;
This section is divided into two parts. The first is devoted&#13;
entirely to exchange controls which are imposed on the purchase of foreign&#13;
exchange and which take the form of licenses, amount limitations or taxes.&#13;
The second reviews the other types of limitations to trade and foreign in-&#13;
vestment in services, such as discriminatory taxes, subsidies, quotas, gov-&#13;
ernment procurement and restrictive actions related to the right of estab-&#13;
lishment.&#13;
1.1       Exchange Controls&#13;
Every year, the IMF publishes a Report on Exchange Restrictions&#13;
which surveys the restrictive practices of its member countries with respect to&#13;
imports and import payments, exports and export proceeds, current invisibles,&#13;
multiple currency practices, bilateral payments arrangements, capital flows&#13;
and gold movements. The 1978 report was used to construct a table of exchange&#13;
controls by country as applied to current invisibles.&#13;
The findings, shown in Table 1, Annex IV, have been arranged in&#13;
three categories: (1) restrictions on residents' overseas travel expendi-&#13;
tures, (2) restrictions on other private services payments, and (3) restric-&#13;
tions on interest, dividend and profit remittances (investment income out-&#13;
flow). Three of the five NFS items are thus absent from the analysis:&#13;
shipping, other transportation and other government services. Expendi-&#13;
tures for other government services are, by their very nature, subject to&#13;
1/   Actually, even this type of restriction might apply to services to the&#13;
extent that certain goods need to be imported if foreigners are to&#13;
provide certain services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
restrictions which need not be discussed further. Payments for freight&#13;
transportation and merchandise insurance are considered incidental to imports&#13;
and exports of merchandise as far as exchange controls are concerned. Indeed,&#13;
countries which control their imports or exports usually issue licenses,&#13;
covering, as well, the foreign exchange required for the corresponding&#13;
shipping services if the imports are needed. Similarly, payments for other&#13;
transportation (mainly to foreign airlines) are considered incidental to&#13;
travel expenditures. Countries controlling these expenditures restrict&#13;
payments to all air carriers, foreign and national, de facto. The dis-&#13;
crimination which governments might want to impose against foreign shipping&#13;
companies or airlines usually takes forms other than exchange controls.&#13;
The analysis of exchange restrictions 1/ in the 137 ITT-member&#13;
countries, comprising 23 OECD and 114 developing countries, reveals many&#13;
interesting patterns. As of the end of 1977, the purchase of foreign exchange&#13;
for current transactions in services was controlled in 101 of the countries,&#13;
including 9 OECD members. 2/ A total of 92 countries employed at least&#13;
one form of exchange control on travel, while in 69 and 50 countries respec-&#13;
tively, other private services payments and remittances of foreign investment&#13;
income were restricted. In addition, 14 developing and 2 OECD countries&#13;
levied taxes on all purchases of foreign exchange.&#13;
1/   The restrictions covered in this section do not include the prevention&#13;
of unauthorized capital outflows.&#13;
2/   These do not include 67 developing and 18 OECD countries which restricted&#13;
or prohibited transactions with specific countries for political or&#13;
ideological reasons. Note also that, in the case of Morocco and 13&#13;
Operations Account Area countries, restrictions may not have universal&#13;
application.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
1.1.1.    Travel Restrictions&#13;
Nine OECD and 83 less developed countries restricted the outflow of&#13;
foreign exchange for international travel by residents. By and large, this&#13;
was accomplished by setting ceilings on travel allowances 1/ or by not provid-&#13;
ing any exchange allocation at all. 2/ In 25 countries, this measure was&#13;
complemented by licensing requirements or a travel tax.&#13;
Travel taxes were administered in various ways in the 21 nations&#13;
that used them. In about a third, the tax was levied as a straight per-&#13;
centage on the travel ticket (e.g., Ghana, India, Panama). In some, there&#13;
was a lump-sum tax per trip (e.g., Colombia, Syria), while in others the tax&#13;
rate varied depending on the mode of transportation (e.g., Philippines),&#13;
the length of travel (e.g., Peru), or the destination (e.g., Bolivia). In&#13;
Afghanistan, the tax was in the form of a substantial passport fee, while in&#13;
Brazil, Colombia and El Salvador a large, non-interest bearing deposit was&#13;
required. Travel taxes were especially popular in Latin America, where more&#13;
than half of the countries using then were located.&#13;
1/   Applications in excess of the basic allowance were typically examined&#13;
on the basis of merit.&#13;
2/   In 7 countries, exchange allocations for tourist travel were suspended&#13;
or approved on a limited basis only: Bangladesh, Burma, Ghana, Guinea-&#13;
Bissau, Guyana, Tanzania, and Vietnam.&#13;

A summary of the exchange restrictions related to travel is pre-&#13;
sented below:&#13;

TOTAL                                     23       114      137&#13;
1.1.2.    Restrictions on Other Private Services&#13;
The other private services item of the balance of payments is&#13;
composed of labor income (earned by nonresidents), property income (royalties&#13;
and license fees) and other services (banking and insurance,.professional&#13;
and technical services, etc.). Only the first two components are considered&#13;
here, because the IMF's report is rather vague on restrictions imposed on&#13;
the remaining ones.&#13;
Payments for other private services were restricted in 6 OECD&#13;
and 63 developing countries. In 39 countries, approval by an authorized&#13;
agency was necessary for transfers of foreign exchange arising from salaries&#13;
of foreign nationals or from royalties, while 47 directly or indirectly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
placed limits on the amount that could be remitted from these same accounts.&#13;
In general, the transfer of amounts in excess of the limit was subject to&#13;
prior approval of the central bank or exchange office.&#13;
In Niger, Taiwan, Guinea and a few other countries, a fixed&#13;
proportion of net annual earnings could be transferred abroad. In other&#13;
countries, the percentage would vary according to marital status (e.g.,&#13;
Cameroon, Mauritania) type of contract (e.g., Libya), nature of employ-&#13;
ment (e.g., Algeria, Syria), or some combination of the above (e.g., Ethiopia,&#13;
Madagascar). There were also ceilings on the amounts that could be remitted,&#13;
as in Burundi, and transfer taxes, as in Colombia and the Operations Account&#13;
Area countries.&#13;
Restrictions on remittances from property income were less numerous&#13;
than those on labor income. Nineteen countries had exchange control for&#13;
labor income but no restriction on property income, while the opposite was&#13;
true in only 3, Brazil, Mali and Austria.&#13;
A summary of the restrictions directed toward other private services&#13;
is shown below:&#13;
Type of Restriction                            OECD      LDC     TOTAL&#13;

1.13.    Investment Income Remittances&#13;
Remittances of profits, dividends and interest arising from foreign&#13;
investments 1/ were subject to exchange controls in 51 developing and 3 OECD&#13;
countries. In 41 countries, there was a limit on the amount of investment&#13;
income that could be transferred to accounts of nonresidents abroad. In most&#13;
cases, the ceiling was established in terms of a fixed proportion of capital&#13;
(e.g., El Salvador, Nigeria, Venezuela), net worth (e.g., Jamaica) or net&#13;
profit (e.g., Peru, Uganda, Yemen P.D.R.). For some countries, such as Iraq,&#13;
Madagascar and Somalia, the ceiling was a variable proportion of capital or&#13;
income, depending on the nature of the economic activities being undertaken.&#13;
In a few other countries, an indirect control was imposed through special&#13;
taxation, typically a fixed percentage of remittances, the case in Uruguay,&#13;
Equatorial Guinea and the Operations Account Area countries. In Rwanda,&#13;
it was a lump-sum tax. The transfer of net profit from foreign capital was&#13;
suspended in Guinea-Bissau, Sao Tome and Principe and Zaire, except when&#13;
such a transaction was guaranteed by the national investment code.&#13;
1/   The IMF Report does not, unfortunately, distinguish between foreign&#13;
investments in goods and services industries.&#13;

1.1.4.    Conclusion&#13;
As a whole, services appear to be plagued by exchange controls.&#13;
This is especially true in the less developed countries, except for a handful&#13;
such as Hong Kong, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, 21exico, Saudi Arabia, and&#13;
Singapore. Exchange controls also prevail in some OECD countries, especially&#13;
Greece, Iceland, Portugal and, to a lesser extent, Italy and New Zealand.&#13;
It is not possible, within the limited scope of this study, to&#13;
evaluate the restrictive impact of exchange controls, either in absolute terms,&#13;
or in comparison to other impediments. However, it should be emphasized that&#13;
restrictions against investment and property income remittances only represent&#13;
a fraction of the protectionism vis-a-vis foreign investment and technology&#13;
transfer. The same holds true for labor income remittances and migration.&#13;
Indeed, the fact of the matter is that international movements of capital and&#13;
labor are subject to strict national legislations, and that restrictions on&#13;
remittances are, to a large extent, a reflection of these policies. Thus,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
the extent of these restrictions cannot, alone, be taken as a measure of&#13;
protectionism in international factor movements. In contrast, the generally&#13;
free international circulation of tourists might explain why more countries&#13;
impose exchange controls on travel expenditures than on other invisible&#13;
transactions.&#13;
1.2       Other Types of Restrictions&#13;
In December 1976, the US Department of Commerce published a report&#13;
on U.S. Service Industries in World Markets which represents the first,&#13;
and so far only, comprehensive analysis of the participation and problems&#13;
of US service industries in international commerce. The report was based in&#13;
part on the work of a US interagency task force established earlier that&#13;
year, chaired by the Commerce Department. The task force was directed to&#13;
identify problems faced by US service industries in international commerce,&#13;
assess current means of international cooperation with respect to handling&#13;
these problems, and recommend appropriate procedures to advance the solution.&#13;
The task force selected 18 service industries for detailed investigation:&#13;
accounting, advertising, auto-truck rental and leasing, banking, building-&#13;
construction-engineering, communications, computer services, educational&#13;
services, employment services, equipment leasing, franchising, health services,&#13;
hotel-motel, insurance, legal services, motion pictures, air transportation&#13;
and maritime transportation.&#13;
As part of the investigation, the Commerce Department contracted&#13;
with a private firm, Wolf and Company, to compile an industry-by-industry,&#13;
inventory of barriers to US trade and investment in services. The company&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
compiled a 160-page inventory from published material, unpublished company&#13;
and industry reports, and interviews with company representatives. 1/&#13;
It covers the 18 service industries selected by the task force, less five:&#13;
communications, educational services, employment services, equipment leasing&#13;
and health services.&#13;
Table 2, Annex IV, presents a summary of the barriers, by country,&#13;
for 11 of the 12 service industries (franchising is excluded). For each&#13;
industry, the only distinction made among types of barriers is between trade&#13;
and investment. 2/&#13;
Some cautionary remarks are necessary before examining Table 2.&#13;
First, the inventory did not cover the US. Second, for each of the 136&#13;
IMF-member countries (as of 1976), it only covered industries in which US&#13;
firms did business. Finally, the inventory was far from exhaustive even for&#13;
countries and industries in which US firms operated. Therefore, a sign&#13;
in Table 2 indicating no barrier cannot be taken as an indication that no&#13;
restriction actually existed. Only indications that a barrier was present&#13;
should be given significance.&#13;
A preliminary analysis of Table 2 suggests that service industries&#13;
might be classified in three categories, according to whether they are&#13;
affected by restrictions: (a) mostly of a trade nature, i.e., advertising,&#13;
motion pictures, air transportation and maritime transportation; (b) mostly&#13;
1/   The inventory is reproduced as Appendix C in the Department of Commerce&#13;
report. The information contained in the compilation is also available&#13;
from the Office of the Special Trade Representative for Trade Negotia-&#13;
tions (STR), which has produced two computer printouts listing the&#13;
barriers by industry and by type of action to be pursued in the event&#13;
of international negotiations.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
of an investment nature, i.e., banking and hotel-motel; or (c) of both trade&#13;
and investment natures, i.e., accounting, auto-truck rental and leasing,&#13;
building-construction-engineering, computer services, insurance and legal&#13;
services. In the remainder of this section, the various types of restrictions&#13;
existing in each industry are briefly reviewed.&#13;
1.2.1.    Industries Primarily Affected by Trade-Type Restrictions&#13;
Obstacles to trade in advertising services are generally in&#13;
the form of licenses (Dominican Republic, Iraq); 1/ quotas (Canada); dis-&#13;
criminatory taxes (Costa Rica, Surinam); embargoes on radio or TV commercials&#13;
(Canada, India, Italy, Korea); or restrictive technical regulations (Greece,&#13;
Indonesia, Mexico).&#13;
Trade in motion pictures is subject to quantitative restrictions&#13;
(Australia, Egypt, India, Switzerland); government monopoly (Burma, Syria);&#13;
local work requirements (Brazil, Canada, Italy, Portugal); screen quotas in&#13;
favor of domestic movies (Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, India, UK);&#13;
discriminatory taxes (Argentina, Denmark, Greece); or government subsidies.&#13;
In addition, some countries impose restrictions on investment income remit-&#13;
tances for foreign distribution companies (Algeria, France, India, Israel,&#13;
Pakistan). These various restrictions probably have economic roots, but,&#13;
equally important is the desire to encourage a local film industry in&#13;
order to preserve and enhance the country's cultural heritage.&#13;
Restrictions in the trade of air transportation services also&#13;
result in part from non-economic motives, such as wanting a national airline&#13;
for reasons of prestige or national defense. Common obstacles include the&#13;

of restrictions.&#13;

use of marketing and sales practices that favor national carriers, such as&#13;
illegitimate discounts, overrides, rebates, etc. (Argentina, Belgium, Germany,&#13;
India); discriminatory taxes (Guatemala, Indonesia, Thailand); or discrimina-&#13;
tory landing fees (Haiti, Italy, Mexico, UK). In addition to the barriers&#13;
mentioned in the Wolf and Company inventory, operating and vessel acquisition&#13;
subsidies often result from government ownership, entirely or in part, of&#13;
national airlines.&#13;
Many nations consider a national merchant marine to be of vital&#13;
economic and security interest. For this reason, many governments apply&#13;
a variety of measures which affect international trade in maritime trans-&#13;
portation services. These include bilateral agreements such as 50/50&#13;
clauses (Brazil, Chile, India, Singapore); special tax treatment in favor&#13;
of national vessels (Argentina, Brazil, India, Philippines); government pro-&#13;
curement (Philippines, Sri Lanka); or cargo preference schemes reserving&#13;
all or part of a country's trade for movement in its own vessels&#13;
(Australia, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Venezuela). 1/&#13;
In addition to the barriers mentioned so far, it appears that many&#13;
nations use operating subsidies which offset all or part of the difference&#13;
between the cost of operating national and foreign vessels, as well as various&#13;
subsidies for the purchase of ships in the form of interest subsidies,&#13;
official low-interest loans, accelerated depreciation, etc. (International&#13;
shipping problems are further discussed in section 2 of this chapter.)&#13;
1/   These and other restrictions have also been surveyed in two recent&#13;
publications of the US Department of Commerce's Maritime Administration:&#13;
The Maritime Aids of the Six Major Maritime Nations (November 1977)&#13;
(France, Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden and the UK) and Maritime Subsidies&#13;
1978 (December 1978); the latter covers subsidies and aid in 58 maritime&#13;
nations.&#13;

1.2.2.    Industries Primarily Affected by Investment-Type Restrictions&#13;
International banking activities are restricted by prohibiting&#13;
the establishment of new branches of foreign banks (Australia, India,&#13;
Malaysia); limiting the financial activities of foreign banks (Ghana, Japan,&#13;
Korea, Nigeria); requiring work permits for foreigners, which are subject&#13;
to a quota or are issued infrequently (Austria, New Zealand, Singapore,&#13;
Switzerland, Zaire); or imposing restrictions on remittances abroad (Brazil,&#13;
Ghana, Italy, Korea, Zambia).&#13;
Investment in hotel and motel activities are sometimes discouraged&#13;
by administrative delays affecting the import of needed supplies (Bangladesh,&#13;
India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka). The Wolf and Company report also notes several&#13;
problems relating to the difficulty of remitting profits in Africa, Latin&#13;
America and Southeast Asia and that import of needed supplies is, in effect,&#13;
prohibited in many Latin American countries.&#13;
1.2.3.    Industries Affected by Both Trade- and Investment-Type Restrictions&#13;
Obstacles to accounting services usually involve various ways of&#13;
restricting the establishment of foreign firms (Denmark, France, Germany);&#13;
governmaent procurement (Brazil, Mexico); or the requirement that foreigners&#13;
practice accounting only after passing a local exam (Belgium, Germany, UK).&#13;
Auto-truck rental and leasing services are subject to restrictions&#13;
on remittances of profits (Greece, Norway, Spain); and on foreign investments&#13;
(Jamaica, New Zealand, South Africa).&#13;
The participation of the building-construction-engineering services&#13;
industry in international commerce is often hampered by problems such as&#13;
regulations specifying that a majority of employees must be nationals (Brazil,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
India, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia); that foreign engineers have work permits,&#13;
often difficult to obtain (Finland, Iceland, Jamaica, Malaysia); government&#13;
procurement practices (Argentina, India, Mexico, Nigeria); export subsidies&#13;
(France, Japan, Korea, UK); or difficulties in remitting earnings (Kenya,&#13;
Senegal, Tunisia).&#13;
There are a number of restrictions on computer services involv-&#13;
ing: the establishment of foreign firms (Brazil, Israel, Italy, Japan);&#13;
licensing (Belgium, France, Mexico, Netherlands); lack of patent and copyright&#13;
protection for software (Australia, Austria, Canada, Greece, Hong Kong,&#13;
Switzerland); and foreign investment income (Chile, Denmark, Iran, Norway,&#13;
Portugal, Venezuela). In addition, in most countries the government is the&#13;
largest customer for computer services, which implies a tendency to favor&#13;
domestic firms.&#13;
Restrictions on legal services generally include regulations and&#13;
requirements that in effect preclude practice by foreign attorneys (Austria,&#13;
France, Netherlands); or laws limiting the activities of foreign attorneys&#13;
(Belgium, Switzerland).&#13;
Freedom to place insurance is narrowed by a large number of govern-&#13;
ment regulations such as restrictions on ownership by foreign companies,&#13;
including nationalization (Australia, Canada, Morocco, Pakistan, Sweden);&#13;
limitations dn the scope of permissible activities (Korea, Thailand); require-&#13;
ments that all resident companies co-insure a portion of the business with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

state-owned reinsurance companies (Italy, Singapore); or government procure-&#13;
ment (Argentina, Indonesia, Jordan). 1/&#13;
1.2.4.    Conclusion&#13;
The analysis in this section was based primarily on the report, U.S.&#13;
Service Industries in World Markets, and on the Wolf and Company inventory.&#13;
This brief review of trade restrictions is far from doing justice to this&#13;
excellent work. It might, therefore, be more appropriate to cite some of the&#13;
report's own conclusions. The reader should remember that the US Department&#13;
of Commerce study examined the problems faced by US service industries and&#13;
thus probably reflects a US viewpoint.&#13;
The major conclusion drawn from analysis of the&#13;
problems faced by service industries in international&#13;
commerce is that their problems are predominantly&#13;
investment-oriented. Many service industries encounter&#13;
obstacles or difficulties in establishing and operating&#13;
affiliates abroad, particularly in LDCs. Generally these&#13;
concern the rights of establishment and ownership, foreign&#13;
taxation, nationality restrictions on the employment of&#13;
personnel, exchange restrictions, profit repatriation&#13;
restrictions, protection of intellectual property, and means&#13;
of international arbitration. (p. 31)&#13;
An important point obtained from the analysis is that&#13;
the trade or investment problems raised by the service&#13;
industries were either: (1) general problems generically&#13;
affecting both goods industries and services industries,&#13;
or (2) industry-specific problems unique to a particular&#13;
service industry, but not shared in common by other service&#13;
industries. No such thing as a "service industries" problem&#13;
was found to exist, in the sense of a problem affecting all&#13;
or most industries -- but not affecting goods-producing&#13;
industries. (pp. 33-34)&#13;

Five industries stated their present international&#13;
barriers and obstacles are significantly restricting their&#13;
international business and its growth. The five are: air&#13;
transportation, maritime transportation, insurance, motion&#13;
pictures, and construction/engineering services. (p. 35) 1/&#13;
2. Protectionism in Trade in Shipping Services&#13;
The only service industry which gave rise to discussions at the&#13;
1979 UNCTAD in Manila was maritime transportation.   The conference adopted&#13;
two resolutions: 120(V) on the "Participation of Developing Countries in&#13;
World Shipping and the Development of Their Merchant Marines" 2/ and 121(V)&#13;
on "Ship Financing and Technical Assistance." 3/ The issue arose from the&#13;
low participation of developing countries in world shipping. 4/ For instance,&#13;
while in 1975 exports from developing countries accounted for about 60 per-&#13;
cent of world seaborne cargoes and imports for about 20 percent (see Table 5),&#13;
they owned only 6 percent of the world fleet (see Table 8). The contrast was&#13;
particularly marked in the bulk trades, where developing countries exported&#13;
90 percent of tanker cargoes and nearly 40 percent of dry bulk cargoes, yet&#13;
owned only 4 percent of the world fleet of tankers and bulk carriers.&#13;
According to a background report by the UNCTAD Secretariat, prepared&#13;
for discussion at UNCTAD V, "developing countries have two valid grounds for&#13;
claiming increased participation in shipping: first, they are trading nations&#13;
1/   One of the direct effect of the conclusions reached in this report has&#13;
been the establishment of the International Service Industry Committee&#13;
(ISIC), with the US Chamber of Commerce which acts to foster the freer&#13;
flow of US services into world markets.&#13;
2/   The developing countries voted for, the OECD countries (minus Turkey,&#13;
plus Israel) against, the Eastern European countries abstained.&#13;
3/   The OECD countries (minus Turkey, plus Israel) abstained, the other&#13;
countries voted for.&#13;
4/   Their share is still below 10 percent; it has, however, been increasing&#13;
considerably since 1974.&#13;

which generate cargoes; and, second, they can operate more economically than&#13;
the traditional maritime countries can operate under their own flags."&#13;
(TD/222, p. 4)&#13;
The second point refers to the issue of "flags of convenience,"&#13;
which constitute a major target for reform by developing countries. Because&#13;
of high labor costs in industrialized countries and of laws in some maritime&#13;
countries which restrict or even prohibit the employment of foreigners on&#13;
national flag ships (for reasons of safety and defense and because of the&#13;
difficulties of operating a ship with a small community of mixed nationali-&#13;
ties), some shipowners have transferred their operations from industrialized&#13;
to open-registry countries partly because that way they can ignore labor and&#13;
tax laws. Between 1965 and 1977, the fleets of the open-registry countries&#13;
offering "flags of convenience" have grown from 15.1 to 28.1 percent of the&#13;
world gross registered tonnage (grt), while the fleets of the developed market&#13;
economy countries dropped from 69.6 to 54.3 percent. 1/ The developing&#13;
countries, which supply much of the unskilled labor needed to operate the&#13;
open-registry fleets, claim the right to acquire them. 2/&#13;
1/   (See TD/B/C.4/178).&#13;
2/   The negotiations between developed and developing countries on this&#13;
issue have had no success so far. Just recently, the UNCTAD working&#13;
party considering the phasing out of "flags of convenience" has ended&#13;
in stalemate. See Financial Times, January 23, 1980.&#13;

In summary, the UNCTAD Secretariat has called for the following&#13;
set of measures: 1/&#13;
(1) Recognition of the rights of developing countries&#13;
to equitable participation in the carriage of bulk&#13;
cargoes generated by their own trade, and agreement&#13;
on the measures needed to implement those rights,&#13;
including agreement that:&#13;
(a) Where bulk cargo movements can maintain tankers&#13;
or bulk carriers in regular employment between&#13;
a pair of trading countries, the rights to par-&#13;
ticipate in the transport should be equitably&#13;
shared;&#13;
(b) Developed trading partner countries that cannot&#13;
operate national-flag tankers and bulk carriers&#13;
economically should be urged to yield the major&#13;
percentage of transport rights to developing&#13;
trading partner countries which can operate&#13;
national-flag vessels economically. 2/&#13;
(2) Agreement on the principles relating to the economic&#13;
elements of the genuine link that must exist between&#13;
a vessel and its country of registry.&#13;
1/   We present them without either agreeing or disagreeing.    An indepth&#13;
analysis and critical evaluation is beyond the scope of this study.&#13;
2/   A case by a case approach would be required to determine whether&#13;
a national fleet of a developing country would be economical.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
(3) Measures to prevent the establishment of new open&#13;
registers and to phase out flag-of-convenience opera-&#13;
tions over a period of years.&#13;
(4) Action to ensure the availability of financing for the&#13;
purchase of secondhand vessels and to ease the terms&#13;
of credit for new vessels.&#13;
(5) Building an institutional framework to promote fleet&#13;
development and strengthen the economic links in&#13;
maritime transport between developing countries.&#13;
The attempt by developing countries to expand their fleets derives&#13;
from several objectives, such as holding freight rates down, 1/ securing&#13;
space for their cargoes on carriers, and earning/saving foreign exchange.&#13;
The potential for earning or saving foreign exchange from shipping depends&#13;
on several factors, including: (1) direct earning/saving from the export&#13;
of shipping services, (2) imports of port services, and (3) the extent to&#13;
which additional vessels have to be acquired from abroad. The decision&#13;
of whether a country should invest in shipping ought to take these and other&#13;
factors into account. 2/&#13;
1/   On the issue of who bears the burden of freight rates, see E. T. Laing,&#13;
"Shipping Freight Rates for Developing Countries: Who Ultimately Pays?",&#13;
Journal of Transport Economics and Policy, September 1977. The paper&#13;
argues that the developing countries do not necessarily bear the burden&#13;
of freight rates as argued by UNCTAD.&#13;
2/   For an example of this type of calculation, see D. Cohen and D. Shneerson,&#13;
"The Domestic Resource Costs of Establishing/Expanding a National Fleet,"&#13;
Maritime Studies and Management, No. 3, 1976.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
The developing countries would like to implement 40-40-20 sharing&#13;
agreements (40 percent for the importing country, 40 for the exporting coun-&#13;
try., and 20 for cross-traders) for both liner and bulk carrier trade, thus&#13;
limiting competition. On the other hand, shipowners in the industrialized&#13;
countries would like to maintain the status quo 1/. More advantageous to&#13;
both would be mutually beneficial cooperation based on the need of developing&#13;
countries for the technical expertise and financial capital that industrial-&#13;
ized countries can provide for the development of merchant marines, and the&#13;
need of industrialized countries for commodities produced by the developing&#13;
world.&#13;
3. Toward Liberalization 2/&#13;
This section addresses the prospects and channels for liberalizing&#13;
international commerce in services among industrialized countries and between&#13;
rich and poor nations. At present, the industrialized countries, and the US&#13;
in particular, not only possess a definite competitive advantage in service&#13;
industries over less developed countries, but they are often also the only&#13;
producers. As a result, developing countries have been importing large amount&#13;
of services from rich countries, either through trade (i.e., shipping and&#13;
other private services, in balance of payments terminology), or through&#13;
1/   In particular they are opposed to the attempt by UNCTAD and the develop-&#13;
ing countries to phase out "flags of convenience". See The Economist,&#13;
December 15, 1979, p. 77.&#13;
2/   Besides the US Department of Commerce report mentioned in the pre-&#13;
vious section, two important references are: B. Griffiths, Invisible&#13;
Barriers to Invisible Trade, published in 1975 by Macmillan for the&#13;
Trade Policy Research Centre, London, and an article by H. Corbet,&#13;
"Prospect of Negotiations on Barriers to International Trade in Services"&#13;
in Pacific Community, April 1977, published in Tokyo.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
investment (i.e., foreign investment income). However, in addition to being&#13;
the largest producers and exporters of services, industrialized nations are&#13;
also the largest importers.&#13;
It is perhaps because of their nontariff character that distortions&#13;
to trade in services have so far been excluded from GATT negotiations. How-&#13;
ever, there are some clear signs that a turning point might not be far away.&#13;
Indeed, the recently concluded Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations&#13;
(MTN), which dealt with nontariff trade barriers, represented a definite&#13;
break, with the pattern of the six previous GATT-sponsored trade-liberaliza-&#13;
tion exercises held since the end of World War II. These earlier trade nego-&#13;
tiations were primarily concerned with reducing tariffs, whereas the most&#13;
important achievement of the Tokyo Round is a series of codes of conduct&#13;
regulating nontariff distortions to trade. The code agreements reached in&#13;
Geneva in April 1979 cover the following: customs valuation, government&#13;
procurement, import licensing procedures, technical barriers to trade (prod-&#13;
uct standards), subsidies and countervailing measures, and antidumping meas-&#13;
ures.&#13;
Although the codes refer to trade in merchandise, some include&#13;
specific references to services -- those relating to government procurement,&#13;
product standards, subsidies and countervailing measures. 1/ The procurement&#13;
code covers services to the extent that they are incidental to procurement&#13;
of goods and do not exceed the value of the goods being purchased. However,&#13;
it calls for a major review within three years and contains an explicit&#13;
1/   Some of the GATT actions are also discussed in R.J. Krommenacker, "Trade-&#13;
Related Services and GATT," Journal of World Trade Law, November-December&#13;
1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
obligation that the GATT Procurement Committee give early consideration to&#13;
covering service contracts. The code on standards contains obligations which&#13;
will apply to product standards certification services, both governmental and&#13;
privately operated. It lays down a series of procedures and requirements&#13;
designed to facilitate certification of internationally traded goods. Finally,&#13;
the code on subsidies/countervailing measures covers services to the extent&#13;
that they are used as incentives (subsidies) to domestic producers. For&#13;
instance, transportation or advertising subsidies might be subject to the&#13;
code's provisions. Certainly, these and the other codes could easily be&#13;
extended to include services fully.&#13;
Not surprisingly, the moderate success in getting services covered&#13;
at the Tokyo Round can be attributed almost exclusively to the efforts of the&#13;
US, the world's largest exporter of services. Its efforts were a reflection&#13;
of the Trade Act of 1974 which, for the first time, gave the US government a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
mandate to pursue problems involving trade in services in the M4TN. 1/ How-&#13;
ever, other industrialized nations have in the past also shown an interest&#13;
in discussing issues related to services. Indeed, the OECD has been carrying&#13;
out activities in this field for many years in several of its coummittees. 2/&#13;
Of particular note is the OECD's Code of Liberalization of Current Invisibles&#13;
1/   In a recent statement of the US Chamber of Commerce to the House Sub-&#13;
committee on Trade, a member of the ISIC declared that (1) the US ser-&#13;
vice industries face strong competition from industrialized countries&#13;
such as France, Germany, and Japan; and advanced developing countries&#13;
such as Brazil and Korea are also making inroads into international&#13;
markets; (2) in several competitor nations (e.g. France, Japan, and&#13;
the UK), the government uses internationally acceptable practices to&#13;
promote and defend the national service industries; and (3) a number&#13;
of competitor nations employ unfair trade practices and discriminatory&#13;
treatment of foreign investment. Therefore, he urged that (1) service&#13;
industries and the invisibles in general should be given the kind of&#13;
policy attention by US foreign economic policynakers that is given&#13;
manufactujring and agricultural sectors; (2) the expansion of US ser-&#13;
vice industries into foreign markets should be given a priority within&#13;
government promotional programs and incentive systems that is equiva-&#13;
lent to that now given to the other sectors; and (3) service industries&#13;
also should have equivalent government attention in dealing with prob-&#13;
lems such as subsidized competition, unfair trade practices, non-&#13;
tariff barriers, investment barriers and procedural discriminations&#13;
which manifest themselves in [nany foreign markets.&#13;
No doubt, the importance of services trade - which provided the US with&#13;
a surplus of $23 billion in the balance of payments in 1978 - is finally&#13;
getting recognized by the US Government. Indeed, in his plan for the&#13;
reorganization of government programs dealing with international trade&#13;
and investment submitted to Congress on September 25, 1979, President&#13;
Carter proposed that (1) within the reorganized Office of the US Trade&#13;
Representative (USTR) an Assistant Trade Representative be in charge of&#13;
service trade matters; (2) in the Department of Commerce, a Deputy&#13;
Assistant Secretary for Finance, Industry and Services be named; and&#13;
(3) the existing International Services Division created in 1978 at the&#13;
Department of Commerce be expanded. This plan has entered into effect&#13;
on January 1, 1980.&#13;
2/   Much of the following paragraph draws upon a note by the Secretariat of&#13;
the OECD's Trade Committee of March 22, 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
Operations, whose implementation is reviewed by the Committee for Invisible&#13;
Transactions. In subscribing to this code, all member countries have under-&#13;
taken to eliminate between one another restrictions on current invisible&#13;
transactions and transfers between residents and non-residents. The OECD's&#13;
Code of Liberalization of Capital Movements provides similar liberalization&#13;
obligations with respect to foreign investment in the services sector (as well&#13;
as all other sectors), while the 1976 instruments on national treatment, which&#13;
are of a different legal character than the two codes, apply to treatment by&#13;
'nost governments of foreign-controlled enterprises after their establishment,&#13;
i.e., after the initial inward investment.&#13;
Since trade aTaong OECD countries probably represents about 50 per-&#13;
cent of the world's trade in services, these various codes and instruments&#13;
are a substantial achievement. However, not all OECD members have adhered&#13;
to them, and many have placed reservations on specific aspects. In addition,&#13;
the OECD does not include the developing countries (except for most Southern&#13;
European countries), whose markets account for about 30 percent of industrial-&#13;
ized countries' exports, a proportion which has been rising over the years.&#13;
As the developing countries continue to industrialize, their con-&#13;
sumption of services is increasing rapidly. Because of the .absence of a&#13;
private service industry for certain items or their lack of international&#13;
competitiveness, the developing countries have applied the infant industry&#13;
argument in order to develop a domestic service industry and use a large&#13;
variety of trade and investment barriers. Thus, while the rich countries by&#13;
and large have been promoting trade and investment liberalization - in words&#13;
if not in fact - the poorer ones have emphasized the need for discriminatory&#13;
maeasures in their favor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
Efforts by the US and other industrialized countries to liberalize&#13;
trade and investment relations with developing countries face a serious prob-&#13;
lem when negotiating services. In most cases, reciprocal market access is of&#13;
little interest to developing countries, as generally they do not seek to sell&#13;
the output of their service industries to the richer countries. Nevertheless,&#13;
they do wish to enter the international arena in certain services for which&#13;
the industrialized countries have adopted a protectionist attitude, mainly&#13;
the air and maritime transportation sectors. These have been organized by&#13;
the developing countries so that competition is limited by a system of liner&#13;
conferences and the International Air Transportation Association (IATA).&#13;
Resolution 119 (V) on "Protectionism in the Services Sector," adopted on&#13;
June 3, 1979, at the fifth session of the UNCTAD in Manila:&#13;
"... calls upon the developed countries to eliminate all&#13;
discriminatory and unfair practices in the services sector,&#13;
and in particular in transport, banking and insurance,&#13;
employed against the developing countries. In the trans-&#13;
port sector particular attention should be given to the&#13;
discriminatory practice of systems of duopoly in civil&#13;
aviation, whereby special fares become an exclusive&#13;
arrangement between two developed countries."&#13;
This resolution was adopted by a majority of the participants at the&#13;
conference, with the developing and centrally-planned countries voting for it,&#13;
and the OECD members (minus Turkey, plus Israel) voting against. It had been&#13;
prepared by Singapore because of an arrangement between the UK and Australia&#13;
by which Singapore's airline is discriminated against.&#13;
It is by now recognized that "positive adjustment policies" are&#13;

manufactures from developing countries, particularly from the newly indus-&#13;
trializing ones. 1/ These policies include structural changes aimed at&#13;
importing more labor-intensive manufactured products from labor-abundant&#13;
countries, while exporting more goods and services that are intensive in&#13;
human capital. Extending GATT negotiations to cover both commodities and&#13;
services would be of mutual advantage to all trading nations, including the&#13;
developing countries, whose needs were recognized in the MTN by the adoption&#13;
of the concept of special and differential treatment in their favor. In&#13;
preparing future goods-cum-services GATT codes, the most difficult task will&#13;
be to deal with the investment-type distortions which hinder international&#13;
commerce in services.&#13;

CONCLUDING REMARKS&#13;
The question which now arises is: where do we go frora here. As&#13;
noted earlier, the issue of protectionism in services is rapidly being in-&#13;
cluded on everyone's agenda. Because of their heterogenous character, how-&#13;
ever, services are most likely to be negotiated in specialized fashion, at&#13;
least during the initial stages. Later, a comprehensive GATT-type negotiation&#13;
might take place. Further, from the point of view of the developing countries,&#13;
the only item of real importance is shipping. There is much work to do on&#13;
protectionism of merchant marines and related industries by both industrial-&#13;
ized and developing nations, as well as on the related issue of "flags of&#13;
convenience."&#13;
From the vantage point of the industrialized countries, the mnain&#13;
concern is with the sale of the output of their service industries, especially&#13;
to developing countries. 'ere, perhaps a couple of industries suchi as banking,&#13;
engineering or insurance could be selected and reviewed in great detail.&#13;
Judging from the recent experience in the field of physical goods,&#13;
it is doubtful whether a reduction in protectionism on the part of developing&#13;
countries is politically feasible. Thus, the only realistic objective and&#13;
therefore field of study is intra-industrialized (i.e., ORCD) country liberali-&#13;
zation of trade and investment in the service industries. However, there may&#13;
be a possibility for negotiations between developed and developing countries&#13;
on both merchandise and NFS trade simultaneously. The developed countries&#13;
could, e.g., reduce tariff barriers on manufactures in return for a reduction&#13;
in NFS trade barriers of the developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
There is a great need to develop a system for monitoring protec-&#13;
tionism in the area of trade in services, in a fashion analogous to that for&#13;
trade in commodities. 1/ The International Monetary Fund is planning such a&#13;
system with respect to exchange controls, and the US Chamber of Commerce's&#13;
International Service Industry Committee is doing some work in this area on&#13;
an industry-by-industry level. However, what is required is a much broader&#13;
initiative at the international level which can serve as a basis for multi-&#13;
lateral negotiations.&#13;
Among other questions and issues open to future research, we would&#13;
include the following ones: (1) The LDCs are demanding a larger share of&#13;
the shipping services market. What is the economic basis for this? (2) In&#13;
what NFS categories do LDCs have a comparative advantage? (3) Do the prin-&#13;
ciples of orthodox trade theory apply to trade in services? (4) Does an&#13;
infant industry argument apply for some NFS categories? (4) Are there pos-&#13;
sibilities for regional integration in developing countries to achieve econ-&#13;
omies of scale in services? (5) Does trade in services represent an increas-&#13;
ing share of the service sector?&#13;
Finally, one of the most important conclusions that emerge from this&#13;
study is the importance of the interactions between trade, foreign investment,&#13;
and international labor migration. Further work is needed to understand these&#13;
interactions and the effects that restrictions to trade and factor movements&#13;
have on each other.&#13;

Concept and Definitions&#13;
In this study the balance of payments concept of trade in services&#13;
was used consistently. It refers to international financial transactions&#13;
reflected in the current account resulting from trade in goods and services,&#13;
as well as unrequited transfers. The last two items -- trade in services&#13;
and unrequited transfers -- are sometimes designated as the invisibles com-&#13;
ponent of the current account. Non-factor services, the topic of this paper,&#13;
can be defined as invisibles minus the investment income component of services&#13;
minus unrequited transfers. Therefore, and according to balance of payments&#13;
classifications, non-factor services comprise the following five items:&#13;
(i)     shipment,&#13;
(ii)    other transportation,&#13;
(iii)   travel,&#13;
(iv)    other private services,&#13;
(v)     other government services.&#13;
The definitions of these items as used in this work are in conformity&#13;
with the Balance of Payments Manual of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)&#13;
(4th ed., 1977) and can be summarized as follows. "Shipment" covers freight,&#13;
insurance and other services involved in distributing merchandise on a basis&#13;
consistent with the f.o.b. valuation of the merchandise item. As a convention,&#13;
the IMF always treats shipment of the compiling country's merchandise beyond&#13;
the customs frontier of the exporting country as if it were a service performed&#13;
for residents of the importing country, whether by residents of that country&#13;
or of any other country. This method of estimation thus excludes equal credit&#13;
and debit entries for shipping services performed by the compiling country&#13;
for its own imports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
"Other transportation" covers services performed by carriers,&#13;
chiefly the transport of passengers, that are not classified in "shipment"&#13;
or "travel," together with goods and services acquired by carriers and con-&#13;
sumed in their operations, mainly port services.&#13;
"Travel" covers goods and services acquired from a country by non-&#13;
resident travelers during their stay in that country for their own use. It&#13;
excludes international passenger services, which are included in "other&#13;
transportation." The term "traveler" includes both tourists and business&#13;
travelers.&#13;
"Other private services" includes three types of components:&#13;
(a) labor income, not included elsewhere (n.i.e.), (b) property income, n.i.e.,&#13;
and (c) other goods and services. The first covers incomes that people earn&#13;
working for a resident of a country other than the one in which they them-&#13;
selves reside. It does not include "immigrants' transfers" or "workers'&#13;
remittances" which emanate from persons who have become residents of the&#13;
*country where they work by virtue of being expected to live there for a year&#13;
or more, these constitute unrequited transfers. The main element of the&#13;
component "property income, n.i.e.." is income accruing to the owners of&#13;
patents, copyrights and similar non-financial intangible assets. Income of&#13;
this sort is often referred to by such terms as royalties and license fees.&#13;
All property income on financial assets is classified by the IMF as "invest-&#13;
ment income." The third component covers all goods and services that ar not&#13;
specifically allocated to other items. Some of the main kinds are:&#13;
- non-merchandise insurance&#13;
- communications&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
- advertising&#13;
- brokerage&#13;
- management&#13;
- operational leasing, other than charters&#13;
-  periodicals bought through subscriptions&#13;
- processing and repair&#13;
- merchanting&#13;
- professional and technical services.&#13;
"Other government services" cover expenditures by official entities&#13;
located abroad (embassies and consulates, military units, etc.) for goods and&#13;
services.&#13;

a/ The index represents an arithmetic average of four different tanker sizes&#13;
as reported by the London Tanker Brokers Panel.&#13;
b/ The index represents freight rates as reported by the Norwegian Shipping&#13;
News. Twenty-five percent of the trip charter index was combined with&#13;
75 percent of a three-year moving average of the time charter index,&#13;
since time charter contracts between 1967 and 1975 are assumed to have&#13;
extended over three-year periods.&#13;

b/ Apart from restrictions indicated below, it was reported that Latin American countries are unable to safeguard trademarks (which is a critical problem for the car and truck rental&#13;

            Trade in non-factor services : past trends

        <abstracts>
            Although the emerging interest in trade
            in services has resulted in some studies, research on trade
            in non-factor services (NFS) has been largely neglected.
            This is because of problems with the data and the diversity
            of NFS, which are a heterogeneous collection of items
            usually classified according to five categories: shipping,
            other transportation, travel, other private services and
            other government services. This paper represents the first
            stage of a research project on trade in non-factor services.
            It: (a) presents and analyzes the available data on trade
            non-factor services; (b) formulates a series of preliminary
            hypotheses on the factors affecting NFS trade and presents
            the results of econometric analyses which can be used for
            projections in the global model for the World Development
            Report; and (c) discusses the impediments to NFS trade as
            seen by both developed and developing countries; and (d)
            sets out issues which might be analyzed in the next stage of
            the project.
