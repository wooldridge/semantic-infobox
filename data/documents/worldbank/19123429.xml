&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of&#13;
16 countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted&#13;
countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in&#13;
place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systemsâ&#128;&#148;in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the&#13;
African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations&#13;
Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

&#13;
Since the early 1990s, Ghanaâ&#128;&#153;s water and sanitation sector       significantly from those of the JMP. The Community Water&#13;
has seen major reforms to address weaknesses. Appropriate        and Sanitation Agency (CWSA) reports rural coverage of&#13;
institutional, legal, and regulatory structures are now          57 percent in 2008, while the Ghana Water Company Ltd&#13;
largely in place, particularly for the urban and rural water     (GWCL) reports 58 percent as the urban water coverage.&#13;

and Housing (MoWRWH) has provided leadership in the              to improved sanitation, with the JMP reporting coverage at&#13;
area of drinking water supply, kept to policy formulation,       13 percent in 2008, up from 7 percent in 1990 (implying an&#13;

perform their roles. There are clear lines of responsibility     target for sanitation, given the predominant use of shared&#13;
and all subsector policies have been consolidated into the       facilities (54 percent), which are considered unimproved&#13;
National Water Policy (NWP) and the National Environmental       according to definitions used by the JMP. By far the greatest&#13;

and Rural Development (MLGRD), recently upgraded to a&#13;
directorate, has taken on a leadership role for sanitation       An estimated US$237 million in capital investment (CAPEX) is&#13;
in Ghana. Yet considerable efforts are still required in the     required annually for water supply. Estimated requirements&#13;
sanitation subsectors, not the least of which is to strengthen   for sanitation are higher, at US$406 million per year, a&#13;
EHSDâ&#128;&#153;s capacity. Whilst the enabling environment has been        substantial part of which the government expects to be&#13;
largely created, developing and sustaining service delivery      borne by households. It is clear that anticipated spending&#13;
presently needs greater emphasis.                                will not be enough to achieve the sector targets and that&#13;
                                                                 increased and more innovative financing, sector planning,&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                  Water Supply and Sanitation in Ghana: Turning Finance into Services for 2015 and Beyond&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;
turned into services, are:&#13;
&#13;
  Sectorwide&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Empower District Assemblies to take full ownership of service delivery through capacity building and funding support.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Ensure greater synergy between the CWSA and GWCL in implementation of projects to benefit from economies of&#13;
     scale and avoid under- or over-laps in service areas.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Urgently pursue the development of comprehensive sector investment plans.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Ensure better linkage between sector targets and funding allocations.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Increase domestic allocations and disbursements to sector institutions and ensure prompt utilization of funds.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Provide greater visibility for sanitation by further defining and disaggregating sanitation budget lines.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Develop innovative approaches to financing, particularly for sanitation.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Undertake regular monitoring of the equity of access to services.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 MoWRWH should collaborate with Ghana Statistics Service to conduct a water-, sanitation-, and hygiene-specific&#13;
     survey to provide needed data not captured under the national representative surveys.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Agree to definitions and a set of national indicators for water supply and sanitation.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Implement the District Monitoring and Evaluation System nationally.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Undertake consolidated annual sector reporting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Close the funding gap for rural water supply.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Revisit implications on sustainability of removing the 5 percent community contribution to capital costs.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Identify innovative ways of providing drinking water to challenging hydro-geological areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Set a clear roadmap on actions to be taken after expiry of management contract for urban water supply.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Bring tariffs in line with full-cost recovery, in parallel with successful achievement of efficiency targets.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Ensure greater participation of existing consumers and potential consumers in investment and supply decisions of the&#13;
       GWCL.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Mainstream independent value-for-money studies in all loans/grants for urban water supply projects.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Institute a system of incentives and penalties for management of urban water supply.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Give greater visibility to pro-poor unit within the urban utility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural sanitation and hygiene&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Prepare a national sanitation program to address the rural sanitation deficit if the MDG is to be achieved.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Declare a clear policy direction on how to deal with the high proportion of shared facilities.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Make vigorous efforts to establish microfinance schemes to support sanitation delivery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban sanitation and hygiene&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Develop innovative approaches to urban sanitation, including microfinance schemes, to support building of&#13;
     household sanitation facilities.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Develop a clear policy for increasing access among peri-urban and low income communities in cities.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Strengthen institutional capacity for the management of sewerage treatment system since metropolitan, municipal,&#13;
     and district councils as currently structured and staffed cannot do this.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                       3&#13;

1.	 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country&#13;
Status Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what its&#13;
member governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 The African&#13;
Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW) delegated this task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the&#13;
African Development Bank who are implementing it in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in over 30 countries&#13;
across SSA. This CSO2 report has been produced in collaboration with the Government of Ghana and other stakeholders&#13;
during 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage, a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments, and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage in&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation. A synthesis&#13;
report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

 Coverage: Assessing Past Progress                                          The CSO2 also compares countriesâ&#128;&#153; own estimates&#13;
                                                                            of coverage with data from the UNICEF/WHOâ&#128;&#153;s Joint&#13;
 Stakeholders in Ghanaâ&#128;&#153;s water, sanitation and hygiene                      Monitoring Programme (JMP), which are themselves based&#13;

 Coverage reported for 2008 for rural and small town                        water sources in Ghana at 82 percent as of 2008 with&#13;
 water supply by the Community Water and Sanitation                         17 percent of the population receiving water piped into&#13;
 Agency (CWSA) was 57 percent, whilst the Ghana Water                       premises, and 65 percent relying on other sources such&#13;
 Company Ltd (GWCL) reported 58 percent as the urban                        as standpipes and water points. If these estimates are&#13;
 water coverage, giving a national coverage rate of 58                      accepted, then the MDG target of 77 percent has already&#13;
 percent. Both the CWSA and GWCL plan their interventions                   been reached (the MDG target, as derived from the latest&#13;

3.	 Reform Context:&#13;
	 Introducing the CSO2 Scorecard&#13;
&#13;
To achieve the broad objectives set in Ghanaâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#152;Vision            in 2009 are significant developments. Support is being&#13;
2020â&#128;&#153; (1995â&#128;&#147;2020) and the Ghana Poverty Reduction                 provided by DANIDA, UNICEF and The Netherlands&#13;

had to undergo significant reforms beginning in the 1990s.        to take up the numerous challenges that confront the&#13;
The recent history puts the service delivery pathway in           sanitation subsector. A National Environmental Sanitation&#13;
context, which can then be explored in detail using the           Action Plan and Investment Plan (NESSAP) has been&#13;
CSO2 scorecard, an assessment tool providing a snapshot           launched to accelerate sanitation delivery at national,&#13;
of reform progress along the whole pathway. The CSO2              district, and community levels. CLTS is now seen as a&#13;
scorecard assesses the building blocks of service delivery        viable approach for sanitation.&#13;
in turn: three building blocks which relate to enabling&#13;
services, three which relate to developing new services,          A private operator, Aqua Vitens Rand Ltd. (AVRL), has been&#13;
and three which relate to sustaining services. Each building      introduced in the urban water supply subsector under a&#13;
block is assessed against specific indicators and scored          management contract, whilst local private operators are&#13;
from 1 to 3 accordingly.9                                         partnering some communities to operate and manage&#13;

At the time the reforms commenced, the rural populationâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
access to safe drinking water was low (30 percent) and the        More recently, processes for harmonization and the&#13;
supply-driven top down approach was seen as unsuitable            acceleration of the SWAp have resulted in a clear&#13;

rapid urbanization, old and dilapidated water infrastructure,     sectorwide monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system with&#13;
poor management, high levels of unaccounted-for water,            the establishment of a Water and Sanitation Monitoring&#13;
low tariffs and lack of investments, all combined to create       Platform (WSMP).&#13;
the need for extensive reform. The thrust of the reforms&#13;
involved: (a) transformation of the role of the public&#13;
sector from that of service provider into a facilitator of        Figure 3&#13;
decentralized (especially for rural and small town water          Average scorecard results for enabling,&#13;

(e) the introduction of private sector participation (PSP)&#13;
into urban water supply. Various subsector policies were&#13;
consolidated into a National Water Policy (NWP), which is&#13;
currently in operation.&#13;

Simultaneous to these reforms, the sector agencies put         blocks of policies, plans, and budgets. However, as Figure&#13;

targets. In recent years both the CWSA and GWCL have           with a GNI per capita above US$50011). For instance, in&#13;
developed SIPs that have taken into account the countryâ&#128;&#153;s      relation to the pricing of water services, there has been a&#13;
coverage targetsâ&#128;&#148;structured into medium-term and long-         positive direction towards achieving cost recovery in the&#13;

&#13;
Ghanaâ&#128;&#153;s water and sanitation sector has a well-established        Figure 4&#13;
institutional set-up with clear lines of responsibility. All      Scorecard indicator scores relating to&#13;
subsector policies have been consolidated into the NWP and        institutional framework compared to peer group&#13;

domain. Whilst sanitation suffered challenges in relation&#13;
to institutional leadership in the recent past, this has now&#13;
been addressed with the elevation of the Environmental&#13;
Health and Sanitation Division into a Directorate, and&#13;
strengthening of manpower and logistical support through&#13;

According to the CWSA, rural water coverage has                            2008 and 2012 stand at US$175 million, implying an&#13;
increased at promising rates from 32 percent in 1990 to 57                 overall deficit of US$330 million. However, the CWSA&#13;

the national MDG+ target the annual increase in coverage                   2008 and the MDG+ 2015 target, the CSO2 costing model&#13;
would need to be around 6 percent, starting from 2009.                     gives a higher estimate of capital investment requirements,&#13;
The JMP meanwhile reports much higher coverage based                       at US$123 million per year (including rehabilitation of&#13;
on household surveys, reaching 74 percent in 2008, up                      existing systems). Compared with anticipated annual&#13;

Ghanaâ&#128;&#153;s urban water subsector, whilst having its own&#13;
challenges, scores quite well against its peers throughout&#13;
the service delivery pathway (Figure 16). In large measure&#13;
there are clear policies and strategies guiding the&#13;
subsector, whilst mechanisms exist for planning with&#13;
the regular preparation and revision of sector investment&#13;
plans. Contrary to what has often been indicated by the              Sustaining                  Developing&#13;
GWCL, the sole urban water utility, the subsector has&#13;
enjoyed substantial injections of capital investment, while        Ghana average scores&#13;

The utility attracted over US$614 million in grant and&#13;
commercial funding between 2002 and 2008, and a                 existing and future consumers whom these investments&#13;
further US$185 million worth of grant/loan projects are         are to serve, and who have to bear the impact of increased&#13;
ongoing. However, the impact on coverage from these             tariffs.&#13;
investments has not been significant. Over the period&#13;
2003 and 2008 data provided by the utility indicates that       The GWCL has a set of criteria for its investment decisions.25&#13;
coverage moved from 59 percent in 2003 down to 55               However, the lack of inclusiveness in the utilityâ&#128;&#153;s decision&#13;

This implies that recent investments have only been able        services to the poor have raised equity concerns, as&#13;
to reverse the downward trend in coverage, given the            reflected in the scorecard score for this building block&#13;
state of infrastructure and the high growth in Ghanaâ&#128;&#153;s          (Figure 16). Indeed a significant proportion of the urban&#13;
urban population, particularly in the major cities of           poor do not enjoy direct access to the utilityâ&#128;&#153;s mains and&#13;
Accra, Kumasi, and Sekondi-Takoradi. It could also imply        have to depend on secondary and tertiary suppliers.&#13;
that some systems are over-designed, with consequent&#13;
implications for tariffs. Overall, what is suggested is         While the GWCL engages the public when it is seeking&#13;
the need for greater scrutiny of the GWCLâ&#128;&#153;s investment          upward adjustments to its tariffs, it is of some concern that&#13;
decisions by the regulator and wider consultations with         subsector output and performance are not in the public&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Ghana :
            turning finance into services for 2015 and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The African Ministers' Council on
            Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round
            of Country Status Overviews (CSOs) to better understands
            what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation (WSS)
            and what its member governments can do to accelerate that
            progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). AMCOW
            delegated this task to the World Bank's Water and
            Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are
            implementing it in close partnership with United Nations
            Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization
            (WHO) in over 30 countries across SSA. This second CSO
            report has been produced in collaboration with the
            Government of Ghana and other stakeholders during 2009-10.
            The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service
            delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and
            sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and
            urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and
            hygiene. The second CSO analysis has three main components:
            a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the
            adequacy of future investments; and a scorecard which allows
            diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service
            delivery pathway. The second CSO's contribution is to
            answer not only whether past trends and future finance are
            sufficient to meet sector targets, but what specific issues
            need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned
            into accelerated coverage in water supply and sanitation. In
            this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified
            through consultation. A synthesis report, available
            separately, presents best practice and shared learning to
            help realize these priority actions.
