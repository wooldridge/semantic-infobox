SOLID WASTE/ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Implementing Agencies: Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR)&#13;
Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs (MMRA)&#13;
Borrower:              Lebanese Government&#13;
Beneficiaries:         Council for Development and Reconstruction; Ministry of Municipal&#13;
and Rural Affairs; Cazas and Municipalities; the people of Lebanon&#13;
and visitors to the country.&#13;
Amount:                US$55.0 million.&#13;
Terms:                 IBRD  standard variable interest rate, with 17-year maturity,&#13;
including 5 years of grace.&#13;
Project Objectives:    The objectives of the project are to: (i) eliminate unsanitary and&#13;
improper dumping of solid waste; (ii) improve methods of waste&#13;
collection and disposal; (iii) improve cost recovery and modernize&#13;
municipal management and finance systems; (iv) improve the quality&#13;
and marketability of compost, through the introduction of upstream&#13;
sorting of the waste; (v) increase the involvement of the private&#13;
sector in solid waste management; (vi) strengthen MMRA and the&#13;
participating municipalities; and (vii) develop instruments for the&#13;
more orderly planning and development of the coastal zone.&#13;
Project Description:   The project would comprise provision of: (i) refuse collection&#13;
facilities - containers and compactor trucks; (ii) waste disposal&#13;
facilities - sanitary landfills and compost plants; (iii) a hospital waste&#13;
collection and disposal system; and (iv) technical assistance and&#13;
preparation of a coastal zone management plan. It would meet the&#13;
country's needs in solid waste management facilities, as foreseen in&#13;
the NERP. It would strengthen the institutions responsible for solid&#13;
waste management (SWM) and encourage private sector&#13;
participation, not only in the collection services but in the whole&#13;
sector, including the investment of capital in SWM. It would also&#13;
help develop a Coastal Zone Management (CZM) plan that would&#13;
serve as a tool to protect the Lebanese coast from further&#13;
degradation.&#13;
Benefits and Risks:    The principal project benefit would be a major improvement in the&#13;
environment and in public health conditions through the elimination&#13;
of accumulated refuse and uncontrolled dumping. Future&#13;
development of the Coastal Zone would be controlled. The main&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
risks relate to the weakness of the municipalities which are&#13;
responsible for collection and disposal services and to the difficulties&#13;
of finding suitable land for sanitary landfills.&#13;

SOLID WASTE/ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. The Economy&#13;
1.1   Lebanon, a prosperous upper middle-income country in the mid-70s, has been devastated&#13;
by 15 years of turmoil as a result of violent civil strife and military occupation. In the period&#13;
between 1950 and 1975, Lebanon's free market economy expanded by about 6 percent per&#13;
annum. This growth was largely driven by the service sectors, namely, trade, tourism, and&#13;
finance, which attracted business from surrounding oil-based economies. After the eruption of&#13;
civil war in 1975, the economy deteriorated markedly, with intermittent recovery during the two&#13;
periods of relative calm, 1978 to 1981, and 1986 to 1988. The civil war had a severe impact&#13;
on the socio-economic conditions in the country. Lebanon's per capita income, about US$1,900&#13;
in 1993, in real terms was only about half of the 1975 level, and income inequalities have been&#13;
accentuated. The total damage to physical assets during the war period was estimated by the&#13;
United Nations at US$25 billion. All principal sectors of the Lebanese economy - physical and&#13;
social infrastructure, office and factory buildings, and housing - have been affected. Damage&#13;
is both a direct result of the war, as well as the accumulated effects of a near total disruption&#13;
in capital investment and maintenance.&#13;
1.2   The impact of the civil war on social conditions has been equally grave. The loss in&#13;
human resources has been considerable; apart from the tragic loss of life and the disabling of&#13;
hundreds of thousands of people, about 200,000 professional and skilled Lebanese have sought&#13;
employment in other countries. While this has resulted in major shortages of skilled workers&#13;
in various sectors of the economy, unemployment nevertheless is estimated at 35 percent of the&#13;
resident labor force, and is believed to be particularly high among urban youth. Nearly one&#13;
quarter of the population of 3.6 million has been displaced and now lives in unhealthy shanty&#13;
towns, and in semi-destroyed and vacated buildings, with severe overcrowding and inadequate&#13;
housing quality. Urban poverty problems are especially pressing in Beirut. Public and social&#13;
services are either non-existent or of poor quality, with only about one-third of power capacity&#13;
operating, water treatment and sewerage virtually nonexistent, and most schools and hospitals&#13;
damaged.&#13;
1.3   Against this background, the Government of Lebanon has prepared a three-year National&#13;
Emergency Reconstruction Program (NERP) which has recently been extended to the ten-year&#13;
Horizon 2000 program. A large part of the investment program is projectized, but many of the&#13;
projects need to be further developed in terms of consistency with sectoral policies, engineering&#13;
soundness, and economic feasibility. The first five years of the Horizon 2000, which includes&#13;
the NERP, amounts to approximately US$5 billion (in constant 1992 prices).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2-&#13;
B. The Solid Waste Management Sector&#13;
1.4   Solid waste collection and disposal services deteriorated greatly during the civil war.&#13;
Refuse collection trucks and containers, often used as barricades during the fighting, were&#13;
destroyed.  The remaining equipment has either lived beyond its effective life or was&#13;
prematurely damaged because of lack of maintenance.  Thus, refuse collection services&#13;
deteriorated to the point where they became almost non-existent and solid waste was haphazardly&#13;
dumped on the streets, vacant lots and the coastline, with frequent intermingling of hospital and&#13;
other hazardous wastes.&#13;
1.5   Refuse collection and disposal have always been the responsibility of the municipal&#13;
authorities. The service is funded, along with other municipal services, from the fungible&#13;
revenues of the municipalities. These consist of: (i) a municipal tax equivalent to 11 percent of&#13;
the imputed rental value of property, and the proceeds from land sales and construction permits,&#13;
all of which are collected directly by the municipalities; and (ii) a share of certain revenues, such&#13;
as a 10 percent surcharge on telephone, electricity and water bills, and duties on imports, liquor&#13;
and fuel, collected by the Central Government and distributed to the municipalities on the basis&#13;
of population and the size of the previous budget, Beirut being limited to 60 percent of the total&#13;
under the existing formula. In the past, municipalities were capable of providing adequate refuse&#13;
collection services, although the development of sound disposal systems had only just started&#13;
when the civil war broke out. With time, the resource base of the municipalities was eroded&#13;
because: (i) the Lebanese Pound has slid to about one-thousandth of its value in 1975; (ii)&#13;
Lebanon, until July 1992, practiced absolute rent control, leaving revenues from the municipal&#13;
tax frozen in terms of Lebanese Pounds; recently, however, rental values have increased&#13;
between 15- and 80- fold, according to the age of the property; (iii) during the war there was&#13;
a drop in the revenues from electricity, water and telephones; however, the revenues from&#13;
surcharges on these services are expected to increase substantially as the major service&#13;
bottlenecks are removed with the help of the NERP, and follow-on projects; and (iv) because&#13;
of Central Government budgetary constraints, the share of the municipalities has not been paid&#13;
from the Municipal Fund although transfers are expected to resume in the not too distant future.&#13;
Pending resumption of transfers from the Municipal Fund, the municipalities have to rely in part&#13;
on ad-hoc advances from the Central Government to meet priority needs. Government has&#13;
recently undertaken a study (funded by the Bank) for the development of a long-term strategy&#13;
for solid-waste management, anchored on the achievement of full cost recovery in the sector&#13;
(para. 3.8).&#13;
1.6   Until recently, municipalities were under ihe tutelage of the Ministry of Interior (MOI),&#13;
which gave priority to matters of public security over the provision of municipal services. In&#13;
recognition of this difficulty, the Government has established a Ministry of Municipal and Rural&#13;
Affairs (MMRA) whose primary role is to assist the municipalities, as described in Annex 1.&#13;
MMRA's capacity to assist municipalities would be strengthened under the project through the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
provision of technical assistance and training. A sector development policy statement has been&#13;
prepared by Government (Annex 11).&#13;
1.7    Although Lebanon's physical features sometimes make it difficult to find sites for sanitary&#13;
landfills with suitably large capacity for refuse disposal, this is still the least cost and simplest&#13;
method of disposal (see Annex 8). Composting is also considered an appropriate technology for&#13;
the disposal of large volumes of waste, particularly where there is a potential market for the&#13;
product, as market studies (available on file) indicate for agricultural areas. Incineration is&#13;
rarely a viable option in Lebanon due to the substantial investment cost, high ratio of organic&#13;
matter in the refuse, and the extremely high operating costs. The Public Sector Investment&#13;
program for the sector under Horizon 2000, which consists mainly of the proposed project,&#13;
amounts to about US$200 million.&#13;
C. Environmental Management&#13;
1.8   One of the results of the civil war in Lebanon was the deterioration of public services,&#13;
particularly water supply, waste water disposal, solid waste collection, power supply, and public&#13;
transport. The deterioration of solid waste services has created a severe risk to public health&#13;
and the environment due to: pollution of water sources and distribution systems; discharge of&#13;
waste directly into the sea and into irrigation canals; scattered piles of haphazardly dumped solid&#13;
waste throughout the country; mixing of hospital waste with domestic waste; and air pollution&#13;
caused by burning of solid-waste. The situation has been further exacerbated by the lack of a&#13;
country-wide land use system which has led to haphazard expansion of dwellings on the sea&#13;
coast, on fertile agricultural land and on sensitive natural ecosystems; pollution of surface waters&#13;
and underground aquifers caused by uncontrolled pumping to provide the new communities with&#13;
running water; pouring of sewage into disused wells; widespread deforestation; destruction of&#13;
the cultural heritage; and degradation of marine and coastal areas.&#13;
1.9   The coastal zone has been particularly affected by these impacts, and is suffering severe&#13;
environmental degradation. The destruction of the Central Business District (CBD) of Beirut&#13;
and the separation of communities during 15 years of strife, led to the development of major&#13;
commercial and industrial centers along the sea coast, which themselves triggered the&#13;
construction of large housing settlements for employees. The sea coast from Tripoli in the&#13;
North to Tyre in the South has become a continuous stretch of densely populated urban&#13;
settlements, many of which are lacking in services. In several areas along the coastline, solid&#13;
waste dumps and outfalls of untreated sewage pollute the sea, while emissions from traffic,&#13;
power stations, cement plants and other industries, mostly using fuel of doubtful cleanliness,&#13;
contribute to the atmospheric pollution.&#13;
1.10 Lebanon is in the process of preparing a comprehensive national framework for&#13;
environmental protection. Recently, there have been several initiatives towards strengthening&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
the recently created Ministry of Environment (MOE) to enable it to carry out its role of setting,&#13;
monitoring and enforcing environmental standards.  Assistance is being provided by the&#13;
Mediterranean Environment Technical Assistance Program (METAP) for the preparation of a&#13;
national environmental strategy, which will identify the priorities for action and the policy,&#13;
institutional and investment tools for their implementation. This will contribute to the definition&#13;
of the MOE long-term program and provide inputs to establish the broad institutional framework&#13;
for environmental management. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is&#13;
providing a complementary program of technical assistance and training to MOE for the review&#13;
and consolidation of environmental laws and regulations, institutional development, capacity&#13;
building for environmental assessment, and creation of public awareness and participation&#13;
mechanisms. Although the enforcement of environmental regulations is feasible under the&#13;
existing legal framework, it is expected that actions will be accelerated when the revised&#13;
framework is approved by Parliament later in 1995. MOE has recently moved into new&#13;
premises, which will permit an expansion of staff from the present level of approximately 20&#13;
people to the planned level of about 150 people.&#13;
1.11  CDR, which has the overall responsibility for planning and coordination of investment&#13;
programs (see Annex 1), also needs strengthening in its environmental review functions. In&#13;
view of the need to integrate environmental considerations at the earliest stage of the planning&#13;
process, CDR will use the services of the European Union (EU) funded Program Management&#13;
Unit (PMU) to provide a senior environmental expert to train CDR staff and to coordinate&#13;
environmental review activities. The expert, who started in post on April 20, 1995, will also&#13;
coordinate the inclusion of environmental mitigation and monitoring actions into the construction&#13;
and operation of disposal sites (para. 3.3).&#13;
D. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.12 In March 1993, the Bank approved a Loan in the amount of US$175 million for the&#13;
Emergency Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Project (ERRP) to finance high priority&#13;
components of GOL's NERP, including US$30 million for solid waste management.&#13;
Implementation of the ERRP is progressing well. Bank involvement in the proposed Solid&#13;
Waste/Environmental Management Project would help Government to complete the rehabilitation&#13;
of the country's municipal solid waste management systems begund under the ERRP, providing&#13;
a safe and clean environment for its citizens and for the foreign businesses and tourists that are&#13;
crucial to the country's future development. Above all, it would help to establish a technically&#13;
and financially viable development policy in the sector. The project is consistent with the&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy for Lebanon which, inter alia, supports rehabilitation of&#13;
infrastructure, addressing environmental concerns, increasing the role of the private sector in&#13;
the provision of public services and strengthening the core functions of public administration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
2.1   The main objectives of the project are to: (i) eliminate unsanitary and improper dumping&#13;
of solid-waste; (ii) improve methods of waste collection and disposal; (iii) improve cost recovery&#13;
and modernize municipal management and finance systems; (iv) improve the quality and&#13;
marketability of compost, through the introduction of sorting of the waste at the entrance to the&#13;
compost plant; (v) increase the involvement of the private sector in solid waste management; (vi)&#13;
strengthen CDR and MMRA and participating municipalities; and (vii) create instruments for&#13;
the more orderly planning and development of the Lebanese coastal zone. Basically, the project&#13;
would complete the rehabilitation of the country's municipal solid waste collection and disposal&#13;
systems as envisaged under the NERP and introduce a separate system for hospital waste (the&#13;
needs for detection and disposal of industrial/hazardous/toxic wastes are to be studied by MOE&#13;
under terms of reference agreed by the Bank (para. 4.12).&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
2.2   The project would comprise the provision of: (i) refuse collection facilities - containers&#13;
and compactor trucks; (ii) waste disposal facilities - sanitary landfills and compost plants; (iii)&#13;
separate collection and disposal of hospital waste; and (iv) technical assistance and the&#13;
preparation of a coastal zone management plan. It would meet the country's needs in solid&#13;
waste management facilities, as foreseen in the NERP. It would strengthen the institutions&#13;
responsible for SWM and encourage private sector participation, not only in the collection&#13;
services but in the whole sector, including the investment of capital in SWM. It would also help&#13;
develop a Coastal Zone Management (CZM) plan that would help serve as a tool for the&#13;
protection of the Lebanese coast from further degradation.&#13;
C. Detailed Features&#13;
Collection Equipment&#13;
2.3   The collection equipment will consist of containers and compactor trucks. Two types of&#13;
containers will be procured to maintain the standards adopted under the ERRP, namely: (i) 1100&#13;
liter, galvanized containers with covers for use in the urban centers of the coastline; and (ii)&#13;
1500 liter, painted steel, open containers for the rest of the country. The compactor trucks will&#13;
be standardized at 10 cubic meters capacity, as these are suited to the narrow streets of the major&#13;
cities and the winding, steep hills of the hinterland.&#13;
(a)   Containers: These will be 5,200 in number, distributed across the country in&#13;
accordance with the estimated population densities. Of this total, 1,600 will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
in galvanized steel and the remaining 3,600 in painted steel. Added to the 2,800&#13;
containers financed under the ERRP, the total number will be 8,000 (as estimated&#13;
under the NERP).&#13;
(b)   Compactor Trucks: The total number of new trucks will be 180, which, in&#13;
addition to the 76 trucks financed under the NERP, will bring the total to the 256&#13;
trucks estimated as being required by the NERP. Again, distribution will be in&#13;
accordance with estimated population.&#13;
(c)   Special Equipment: Provision has been made in the project for the procurement&#13;
of special equipment.  These include separate containers and trucks for the&#13;
collection and transport of hospital waste to the special incinerator, street&#13;
sweeping and washing equipment for Beirut and trailer trucks for the purpose of&#13;
transporting large quantities of waste.&#13;
Disposal Facilities&#13;
2.4   These will include 15 new landfills (in addition to the 13 financed under the ERRP)&#13;
bringing the total number of landfills in the country to 28, so that each Caza will have its own&#13;
landfill. Three compost plants will be built, one in Saida with a capacity of 200 tons of waste&#13;
per day, one in Zahle, also with a capacity of 200 tons of raw waste per day, and a third one&#13;
with a capacity of 240 tons a day to complement the existing incinerator in Beirut, which has&#13;
a capacity of 240 tons per day (two furnaces, each capable of incinerating 5 tons per hour).&#13;
(a)   Sanitary Landfills: Sites for landfills to be financed under the proposed project&#13;
will be selected on the basis of environmental assessments agreed by the&#13;
executing agency and the Bank. The landfills will be located at suitable distances&#13;
from urban developments. The area will be sufficient to meet the needs of the&#13;
Caza for 20 years. Each sanitary landfill will be enclosed with a suitable fence&#13;
to prevent encroachment by scavengers and stray animals. A guardhouse and&#13;
weighbridge will be located at the entrance to each site, enabling access to be&#13;
controlled and the source of waste and its weight to be recorded. A suitable&#13;
garage on site will house all the equipment belonging to the Caza and will provide&#13;
routine maintenance services. An administration building will house the staff in&#13;
charge of operating and maintaining both the landfill and the mobile equipment.&#13;
Eacti site will be provided with the necessary earth-moving and compacting&#13;
equipment. This will vary in quantity and size depending on the size of the&#13;
lan Ifill and the volume of incoming waste. Generally, each site will be provided&#13;
with a mechanical shovel, a water tanker and a sheep's-foot type earth compactor.&#13;
(b)   Compost Plants: The two compost plants in Saida and Zahle will be designed&#13;
in accordance with appropriate technology. Before the waste enters the process&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
cycle, large, hard lumps of debris will be separated and sorted out. Then, as the&#13;
waste is conveyed towards a shredding/homogenizing drum, recyclable materials -&#13;
glass, plastics, paper, cloth, and bones - will be manually separated and dropped&#13;
from special chutes to a compacting and baling unit for sale to manufacturing&#13;
industries. Ferrous metals will be separated magnetically. The homogenized&#13;
compost will be mechanically aerated and turned, then deposited in windrows&#13;
until maturation. This will result in the production of homogeneous, high-quality&#13;
compost which can be marketed easily to the farming community once its benefits&#13;
are realized.&#13;
(c)   Amrousiyeh Complex: The original design of the incinerator at Amrousiyeh had&#13;
made provision for a third unit of 10 tons per hour incineration capacity.&#13;
Experience with the existing furnaces has not been satisfactory because of the&#13;
high moisture content and low calorific value of the waste. Fuel oil is now used&#13;
to improve combustion and the air emissions consist of black smoke and other&#13;
contaminants related to incomplete oxidation of the combustion gases. The&#13;
Environmental Assessment (EA) report recommends that the incinerator capacity&#13;
should not be expanded as originally designed, and that a compost plant, similar&#13;
to that described above (see (b) Compost Plants) be constructed.  During&#13;
appraisal, it was agreed that part of the land adjacent to the incinerator would be&#13;
used for the construction of a compost plant next to the incinerator.  An&#13;
environmental assessment for this compost plant has been undertaken (see para.&#13;
2.23). Refuse going into the combined facility would be separated - organic&#13;
matter would be channeled to the compost plant while incinerable material would&#13;
go to the incinerator. The calorific value of the waste being incinerated would&#13;
be further improved by (i) selective collection of a minimum of 120 tons per day&#13;
of waste from higher income neighborhoods and/or (ii) high calorific value sorted&#13;
wastes from the compost plant. The project also provides for the rehabilitation&#13;
of the emission system of the existing facility which, upon completion, will&#13;
operate to improved environmental standards based on the European Union (then&#13;
European Economic Community) Directive on Municipal Waste Incineration&#13;
Plants (89/429/EEC - OJ L203, 15 July 1989). The selection of an appropriate&#13;
design for the air pollution control system will be carried out during detailed&#13;
engineering design.&#13;
(d)   Incinerator for Hospital Waste: An appropriately designed incinerator will be&#13;
constructed for the disposal of hospital waste from hospitals throughout Lebanon.&#13;
Its precise location and capacity will be determined by feasibility and&#13;
environmental studies to be undertaken during project implementation.&#13;
Appropriate transport will be procured to transport hospital waste to the&#13;
incinerator.&#13;

2.5   Upon construction of the new landfills, the old uncontrolled dumps will be closed and&#13;
rehabilitated. The rehabilitation of the old dumps will be carried out in accordance with&#13;
internationally accepted standards. CDR will prepare a plan by September 30, 1996 to assess&#13;
the impacts of, and develop cost effective measures for, closing the old dumps and, after&#13;
exchanging views with the Bank, will start to implement this plan by March 31, 1997&#13;
(para. 6.1).&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
2.6   Technical assistance will comprise three major components, namely: (i) the preparation&#13;
of a coastal zone management plan that would serve as a tool for the protection of the Lebanese&#13;
coast from further degradation; (ii) engineering services for the design and supervision of&#13;
construction (or implementation) of project components; and (iii) institutional development for&#13;
CDR, MMRA, and the principal municipalities through the appointment of international experts,&#13;
training of staff, and provision of computers and other modern equipment to help improve&#13;
efficiency.&#13;
(a)   Coastal Zone Management Plan:  This component aims at creating the&#13;
instruments and building the institutional capacities for the physical planning and&#13;
monitoring of the coastal zone development, in order to improve environmental&#13;
conditions and prevent further degradation. Its outputs would include: (i)&#13;
preparing a regional environmental assessment which will identify the cumulative&#13;
pressures and impacts of the coastal zone development under different investment&#13;
scenarios (terms of reference available on file); (ii) establishing a GIS system for&#13;
physical planning and monitoring of the coastal zone development for use by&#13;
CDR, MMRA and the municipalities; (iii) preparing a coastal zone management&#13;
plan to be approved and legally binding on all future developments on the coast;&#13;
and (iv) initiating the implementation of emergency actions to protect and/or&#13;
rehabilitate coastal resources. The coastal zone management plan will include:&#13;
(a) a strategy for the allocation of coastal and marine resources, defining areas&#13;
to be conserved and protected and policies for zoning and development of&#13;
economic activities in the coast; (b) a regulatory needs assessment and preparation&#13;
of draft guidelines, rules and regulations for control of activities on the coast; and&#13;
(c) mechanisms for recurrent funding to support CZM activities and encourage&#13;
public/private partnership.&#13;
(b)   Engineering Services: The designs of compactor trucks, containers, and landfills&#13;
have been completed, or are in the process of being completed, under the ERRP.&#13;
Engineering services will be needed for assistance to CDR in bid evaluation, and&#13;
supervision of construction. Full engineering services will be provided for the&#13;
(i) design and construction supervision of the two compost plants in Saida and&#13;
Zahle; (ii) design and construction of the air pollution control system and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
compost plant at the existing Amrousiyeh incinerator; and (iii) design and&#13;
construction supervision of the incinerator for the disposal of hospital waste.&#13;
(c)   Technical Assistance and Training: As both MOE and MMRA are newly&#13;
established ministries, their staff requires training in the development and&#13;
implementation of their responsibilities. MOE is already receiving technical&#13;
assistance from UNDP for institutional development. In the short term, there is&#13;
an immediate need to create capacity to review and manage environmental&#13;
assessments at CDR, the project implementing agency.  This agency will&#13;
gradually take on responsibilities of decision making and.loan administration for&#13;
the environmental aspects of this loan, and this will be initiated with the&#13;
recruitmnent of a senior environmental specialist experienced in environmental&#13;
assessment to reinforce the PMU at CDR. This would be a permanent position,&#13;
and eventually CDR may require a stronger environmental assessment unit&#13;
composed of several environmental specialists to manage activities related to&#13;
preparation and review of environmental assessments in all infrastructure sectors.&#13;
As currently the institutional capacity for environmental management is in the&#13;
formative stage in Lebanon, the Bank will closely supervise and approve all&#13;
environmental assessments carried out by CDR, the implementing agency (para.&#13;
3.3). MMRA also requires strengthening of all departments. The project will&#13;
recruit three international experts who will constitute the Project Coordination&#13;
Unit (PCU) in MMRA and who will each serve for two years, coordinating&#13;
project implementation and training MMRA staff. These will consist of a: (i)&#13;
senior municipal engineer, with experience in solid waste and wastewater systems&#13;
management; (ii) senior financial expert with experience in modem municipal&#13;
financial management; and (iii) senior planner with experience with planning,&#13;
zoning and urban transport. Upon the recommendations of these experts, the&#13;
project would finance the procurement of computers and other office equipment&#13;
to modernize the accounting and management systems at both MMRA and the&#13;
principal mu-nicipalities, together with the necessary training in their use. Finally,&#13;
the project would provide for the training abroad in municipal management of six&#13;
technical staff from MMRA and one from each principal municipality.&#13;
D. Project Costs aitd Financing Plan&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
2.7   Total project cost is estimated to be about US$135.0 million of which about 41 percent&#13;
will be financed by the proposed Bank loan of US$55.0 million. An exchange rate of US$1.0&#13;
= LL 1650 has been used. The cost estimates for the compactor trucks, containers and&#13;
landfills, are based on the contracts awarded for identical works under the ERRP, adjusted for&#13;

inflation. The cost estimates for the incinerator for hospital waste, the compost plants at Saida&#13;
and Zahle, and the compost plant and rehabilitation of the incinerator at Amrousiyeh are based&#13;
on recent proposals received by CDR for similar projects. No physical or price contingencies&#13;
have been allowed for the cost of land. Similarly, contingencies have not been allowed for the&#13;
technical assistance components. A physical contingency of 10 percent has been included in the&#13;
cost of the civil works only. Price contingencies for equipment and civil works have been&#13;
included on the basis of the following annual inflation rate projections:&#13;

E. Financing Plan&#13;
2.8   Financing of the project would be divided into two distinct, parallel parts: (i) components&#13;
financed through Bank funds; and (ii) components financed through cofinancing. The Lebanese&#13;
Government has requested the Japanese Government to cofinance the project in an amount equal&#13;
to the Bank loan, and the initial reaction so far has not been negative. The Cofinancing funds&#13;
would finance the disposal plants, i.e., the compost plant in Saida, the compost plant in Zahle,&#13;
the compost plant at Amrousiyeh, and the incinerator for hospital waste. The remaining&#13;
components would be financed with funds from the Bank loan. The financing plan is shown in&#13;
Table 2.3 below. A cofinancing agreement for the equivalent of US$55 million will be signed&#13;
with Japan or alternative financing will be found (para. 6.1).&#13;

F. Procurement&#13;
2.9   All Bank-financed civil works, equipment and materials, would be procured in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. Procurement of consultant services and&#13;
technical assistance would follow Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Lebanese&#13;
manufacturers competing for goods and equipment contracts under International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB) would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent of the CIF price or&#13;
the prevailing custom duty applicable to non-exempt importers, whichever is less, provided the&#13;
local value added to the product is not less than 20 percent of the ex-factory bid price.&#13;
2.10 Contracts for the supply of goods and equipment valued at US$250,000 or more would&#13;
be awarded through fCB procedures. Contracts for the supply of goods would be grouped, as&#13;
far as practicable, to attract international competition. Arrangements would be made for phased&#13;
delivery of compactor trucks and containers to match the availability of landfill sites. Goods and&#13;
equipment costing between US$50,000 and US$250,000 would be procured through international&#13;
shopping, up to a limit of US$1.5 million, obtaining at least 3 quotations from suppliers in three&#13;
different eligible countries, and those below US$50,000 would be procured through local&#13;
shopping, up to a limit of US$500,000, by solicitation of at least three price quotations.&#13;

2.11   Contracts for civil works valued at US$500,000 or more would be awarded through ICB&#13;
in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Civil works contracts under US$500,000, and civil works&#13;
for the development of landfills or the rehabilitation of old dumps, which are in the range of&#13;
US$100,000 to US$750,000, would be awarded through LCB open to foreign contractors. LCB&#13;
procedures have been reviewed recently as part of a Country Procurement Assessment Report&#13;
(CPAR) and the differences between Lebanese regulations and the Bank's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines reviewed.&#13;
2.12   All bidding packages for works and goods estimated to cost US$250,000 equivalent or&#13;
more, and consultant contracts over US$100,000 (US$50,000 for individuals), would be subject&#13;
to the Bank's prior review. 'rhese limits would result in prior review of about 95 percent of&#13;
total procurement financed by the loan. Other contracts for works and goods would be subject&#13;
to the Bank's review after award of the contract. Where prequalification is used for major&#13;
equipment contracts, procedures according to the Bank's Guidelines would be followed. Table&#13;
2.4 gives a breakdown of project components to be procured by ICB, LCB, and other&#13;
procedures.&#13;
G. Disbursement and Special Account&#13;

2.14  The estimated quarterly disbursement schedule is given in Annex 6. The disbursement&#13;
schedule is based on the Bank's disbursement profile for the MENA Region but has been slightly&#13;
modified for a 6-year implementation period instead of eight years. This is due to the fact that&#13;
about 50 percent of the loan will be contracted during the first six months of effectiveness (see&#13;
paras. 2.17-2.23). Disbursements are expected to be completed within six months after project&#13;
completion. The closing date of the proposed loan will be December 31, 2001.&#13;
2.15  Out of the proposed loan, US$5.0 million (or 9 percent of total loan) will be used for&#13;
advance procurement and retroactive financing, from the time of appraisal (December 1994),&#13;
of (i) consulting services for institutional strengthening, for the CZM plan, for the proposed&#13;
compost plants in Saida and Zahle, and for the incinerator for hospital waste; and (ii) the&#13;
procurement of compactor trucks and containers. Such advance procurement is necessary for&#13;
timely project implementation and to maintain the momentum started under the ERRP.&#13;
However, all retroactive financing will be within the maximum period of twelve months prior&#13;
to the expected date of loan signing.&#13;
2.16  In order to enable CDR to effectively implement the project and to ensure availability of&#13;
foreign exchange to international contractors, CDR would maintain a Special Account at the&#13;
Banque du Liban, the Lebanese central bank, for a maximum amount of US$2.0 million (US$0.5&#13;
million until US$4.0 million has been disbursed from the Loan Account), which is expected to&#13;
cover the Bank's share of eligible expenditure over a four-month period. Payments from the&#13;
Special Account would only be made for eligible expenditures indicated in the Loan Agreement.&#13;
The account would be denominated in US dollars and replenished monthly, or whenever half the&#13;
authorized allocation has been utilized, whichever comes first. All payments of less than 20&#13;
percent of the authorized allocations to the Special Accounts must be made through the Special&#13;
Account; all other payments may be made using the direct payment or Special Commitment&#13;
procedure. All disbursements for contracts under the procurement prior review limits will be&#13;
submitted under Statements of Expenditures (SOE). Related supporting documents for SOE&#13;
claims would be retained at CDR's headquarters and made available for inspection by Bank&#13;
missions and project auditors. The Special Account and the SOEs will be audited in conjunction&#13;
with the annual audit of CDR's accounts, the auditor providing separate opinions for the Special&#13;
Account. the SOEs and CDR's accounts (para. 3.12).&#13;
H. Project Status and Implementation&#13;
2.17 Engineering Consultancy Services: An international consulting firm was awarded a&#13;
US$1.5 million contract, on the basis of an internationally competitive bidding process, for the&#13;
design and supervision of the landfills for the 13 priority Cazas which formed part of the ERRP.&#13;
Final engineering designs and bidding documents for the first five Cazas of Baalbeck, Chouf,&#13;
Tripoli. Tyre and Zahle have been completed and invitations to bid will be launched in May,&#13;
1995. In view of the similarity of the work between the two phases and for reasons of economy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
and efficiency, CDR, with the concurrence of the Bank, negotiated a US$500,000 extension to&#13;
the contract to cover the engineering services of the second phase of 15 landfills (out of the 25&#13;
Cazas, three are large and will have two landfills each) to be financed out of the proceeds of the&#13;
ERRP. The terms of reference require the consultants to carry out a complete EA for each site&#13;
in accordance with the provisions of OD 4.01. It is expected that all the engineering design and&#13;
bidding documents for the landfills will be completed by the end of June, 1996.  EAs&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank will be carried out and submitted to the Bank for approval prior to&#13;
award of contracts for site development (para. 6.1).&#13;
2.18 CDR will be responsible for the execution of the CZM Plan, under the orientation of a&#13;
technical steering committee. The Committee will include representatives of CDR, MOE,&#13;
MMRA, main coastal municipalities, Departments of Urbanism and Transport (Ministry of&#13;
Public Works), and the Executive Council for Major Projects. The technical assistance for the&#13;
CZM Plan has commenced with the preparation of detailed terms of reference for the Regional&#13;
Environmental Assessment (REA) of the coastal zone. A consultant will commence work on&#13;
the REA in 1995, with retroactive financing under the project.&#13;
2.19 The bidding documents for the compactor trucks and containers have already been&#13;
prepared, following the model used in the ERRP. CDR has started prequalification of the&#13;
bidders and will issue the invitations for bids by June 1995, to be ready for the award and&#13;
signature of the relevant contracts by the date of loan effectiveness.&#13;
2.20 CDR is bidding a contract for the detailed engineering design and bidding documents of&#13;
the compost plant and air pollution control system in Amrousiyeh, in accordance with TORs&#13;
approved by the Bank (the EA has already been completed and reviewed by the Bank). Bidding&#13;
documents would be ready by May, 1995 and CDR expects to be able to award a contract by&#13;
mid-1995. Consulting contracts for the detailed engineering design and bidding documents of&#13;
the two compost plants at Saida and Zahle and the incinerator for the disposal of hospital waste&#13;
will be awarded by international competition, with detailed engineering work starting in the&#13;
summer of 1995 and to be completed early in 1996.&#13;
2.21  Land Acquisition: Land acquisition under the ERRP was initially slow as municipalities,&#13;
most of which did not have the funds for the acquisition of privately owned land and doubted&#13;
that the funds for acquisition and development were available, sought public land for landfill&#13;
sites. However, many of these proved to be unsuitable. Several factors are expected to improve&#13;
the situation very quickly: (i) construction will soon start in the first five Cazas mentioned in&#13;
para. 2.17 above, serving as a model for the others; (ii) CDR will use funds allocated to land&#13;
acquisition under rhe Government's reconstruction program to support municipalities that are not&#13;
able to provide the necessary funds; and (iii) expropriation procedures will be used where&#13;
necessary (a special expropriation unit has been set-up in CDR for this purpose).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
2.22  The project requires the selection of environmentally and economically acceptable landfill&#13;
sites, and to this end has developed a "Summary of General Site Selection Criteria for&#13;
Controlled Sanitary Landfills" (Attachment 8 to Annex 10). These criteria will be used to select&#13;
the landfill sites financed under the project. No sites will be acquired that would involve&#13;
involuntary resettlement. In order to reinforce and accelerate the process of site selection of&#13;
environmentally acceptable sites, a detailed schedule for land acquisition (Annex 9) was&#13;
discussed during negotiations and the following agreements were reached: (i) environmental&#13;
assessment (EA) reports will be prepared by the Borrower to recommend one or more&#13;
environmentally acceptable sites for each Caza and the EA reports will be submitted to the Bank&#13;
for review; (ii) negotiations should be initiated on one or more of the selected sites, and&#13;
expropriation proceedings initiated as necessary; and (iii) no collection equipment will be&#13;
allocated to municipalities until they have acquired the land for landfills (para. 6.1).  These&#13;
procedures should ensure that most landfill sites are acquired for the project by the end of 1995.&#13;
2.23  The two landfill sites in Saida and Zahle have been selected with a view to constructing&#13;
the two compost plants on the same sites, and sufficient space is available for this purpose. This&#13;
will both reduce the environmental impact of the two plants and place them within easy access&#13;
of the landfill for the disposal of rejects. As mentioned under para. 2.4 (c), the Amrousiyeh&#13;
incinerator was originally designed for future expansion and there is sufficient land available&#13;
adjacent to the incinerator for construction of a compost plant. An Environmental Impact&#13;
Assessment of the Amrousiyeh Complex has been reviewed by the Bank.&#13;
2.24 Project Implementation Schedule: Annex 3 shows the project implementation schedule&#13;
in bar chart form. As the project is part of the NERP and is a continuation of the ERRP, many&#13;
project components are linked and will overlap with ongoing projects.&#13;
1. Project Supervision&#13;
2.25  The implementation of the project is expected to take about six years. The Bank would&#13;
supervise the project three times a year during the first two years of project implementation, and&#13;
an average of twice a year during the last four years. The core team for the supervision&#13;
missions would consist of a municipal engineer, a financial analyst, and an environmental expert.&#13;
This core team would be supplemented by experts in the (i) production and marketing of&#13;
compost and utilization of recycled material from the waste; and (ii) incineration of municipal&#13;
solid waste and hospital waste. The project builds on the experience of the ERRP; the&#13;
implementing agency, CDR, is both competent and familiar with Bank procedures. About 14&#13;
supervision missions are planned during project implementation and the supervision effort is&#13;
estimated to require a total of 119 staffweeks (average of 17 staffweeks per year).  The&#13;
supervision effort is heavily front-loaded to ensure adequate performance in the critical early&#13;
years of the project. The tentative supervision forecast is in Annex 4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
2.26 In addition to supervision missions, the project will be monitored through semi-annual&#13;
progress reports which would be submitted by the CDR to the Bank within 30 days after the end&#13;
of each semester during the entire project implementation period. These reports would focus&#13;
on both the cumulative and specific progress achieved during the reporting period for: (a) the&#13;
implementation of the agreed action plan to implement the sector development strategy, including&#13;
its development impact; (b) preparation of environmental assessments for selection of disposal&#13;
sites and status of site acquisition; (c) the bidding process for all major contracts for civil works&#13;
and equipment to be procured; (d) the physical progress by contract of civil works and&#13;
equipment delivery; (e) the status of technical assistance, studies, designs, programs,&#13;
environmental monitoring, and staff training; (f) the status of Bank disbursements and projected&#13;
disbursements for the next six months; (g) the status of covenants and accounts and audit; and&#13;
(h) a summary of any issues raised by Bank missions and actions taken for their resolution. A&#13;
brief summary would be added explaining the reasons for any delays or shortcomings in any of&#13;
the above items and of actions taken to improve progress.&#13;
2.27  A  mid-term  review  of all project activities would be conducted jointly by the&#13;
CDR/MMRA and the Bank. To facilitate this review, CDR would prepare a detailed report&#13;
covering all aspects of the project and submit it to the Bank by December 31, 1998 for a joint&#13;
review in February 1999. The implementation completion report, including assessment of the&#13;
project's development impact, would be prepared by CDR and submitted to the Bank not later&#13;
than six months after the loan closing date.&#13;
J. Private Sector Involvement&#13;
2.28  So far, the involvement of the private sector has been limited to service contracts, using&#13;
existing municipal collection equipment for transport to the dumps. Three relatively large&#13;
contracts for collection and for operation and maintenance were awarded in Beirut to the private&#13;
sector. These included: (i) the operation and maintenance of the Amrousiyeh incinerator, for&#13;
an annual fee of US$1.35 million; (ii) the operation and maintenance of the Karantina compost&#13;
plant, for an annual fee of US$1.75 million; and (iii) collection services for Greater Beirut, for&#13;
an annual fee of US$3.65 million. The first year's operation on all three contracts is being&#13;
funded out of the proceeds of the ERRP and performance is generally satisfactory. A similar&#13;
contract has been awarded for the entire Chouf region. Some municipalities, like Zahle and the&#13;
Association of Northl Metn had on-going contracts with the private sector, even before the&#13;
ERRP. Municipalities will be required to enter into similar contracts under the proposed project&#13;
before receiving collection equipment, unless they are able to demonstrate, as some can, that&#13;
they are capable of performing the function with their own resources (para. 6.1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
K. Women in Development&#13;
2.29 Women, in general, are not directly involved in the collection and disposal of waste. In&#13;
some communities (as in Jbeil), women's groups have formed associations for cleaning the&#13;
environment.  They have started an awareness campaign and have managed to collect&#13;
contributions from businessmen and higher income groups to support the activities of their&#13;
municipalities. However, women are quite active in local administrations both as professionals&#13;
and support staff. The ratio of women in municipal organizations reaches up to twenty percent&#13;
in the major urban areas and about ten percent in the rural communities.&#13;
L. Poverty Impact&#13;
2.30 The project has a high impact on poverty because of the difficulties faced by the poor to&#13;
organize their own waste collection systems. The poor depend on the municipalities to collect&#13;
their waste and are willing to pay a reasonable fee for the service. During periods of failure of&#13;
the municipal institutions, the higher income areas are able to hire private entrepreneurs to&#13;
collect the waste and take it to a dump while, not having the same resources, the largest piles&#13;
of uncollected waste are found in the poorer areas, causing major health hazards. Children&#13;
playing in these areas are particularly at risk. An additional benefit of the project for the poor&#13;
will be the creation of additional employment opportunities in the collection and sorting of waste&#13;
and recycling.&#13;
III. PROJECT EXECUTION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
3.1   While the ultimate beneficiaries of the project will be the people of Lebanon and visitors&#13;
to the country, the intermediate beneficiaries will be the municipal organizations, which are&#13;
under the tutelage of MMRA. The Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR) will&#13;
assume responsibility for implementation of the project, with the support of MMRA. CDR is&#13;
adequately staffed with competent personnel; its procurement regulations, which are simpler than&#13;
those of line ministries, work well and are acceptable to the Bank; and it has rapidly gained&#13;
expertise in implementing Bank-financed projects. Within CDR, a Program Management Unit&#13;
(PMU) consisting of a number of specialists is responsible both for planning and for coordination&#13;
with the line ministries, through Sector Implementation Units (SIUs) located in the ministries.&#13;
This arrangement was set up under the ERRP and found to work well. It is being financed&#13;
under a grant from the European Union.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
B. Organization and Management&#13;
3.2   CDR was established as an autonomous body with a Board of Directors chaired by a&#13;
President and reports directly to the Council of Ministers. The Board of Directors is the&#13;
supreme authority for setting policies concerning CDR's activities, for approval of CDR's work&#13;
program and annual operating and capital budgets, and for awarding and supervising contracts.&#13;
CDR also appoints consultants for the design and supervision of construction/implementation&#13;
contracts.&#13;
3.3   The preparation of environmental assessment (EA) reports for each of the disposal&#13;
facilities (Amrousiyeh complex, compost plants, landfills and hospital incinerator(s)) will be the&#13;
responsibility of the implementing agency, CDR. A senior environmental specialist experienced&#13;
in environmental assessments has been charged with the daily management of the EA work.&#13;
This professional will participate in the forward planning for solid waste that will include: (i)&#13;
preparing terms of reference for EAs for each disposal facility, to include recommendations for&#13;
several environmentally acceptable sites; (ii) managing and monitoring the work of&#13;
environmental consultants; (iii) reviewing EAs to ensure complying with the World Bank's&#13;
Operational Directive 4.1 on the behalf of the Borrower; (iv) submittal of the final EA report&#13;
to the World Bank for concurrence prior to final approval. The environmental specialist position&#13;
within the PMU at CDR was filled on April 20, 1995, financed by the European Union. Terms&#13;
of reference for the Senior Environmental Specialist are provided in Attachment 2 to Annex 10.&#13;
3.4   Monitoring of the consultants carrying out design and supervision is to be effected by the&#13;
PCU for solid waste, which will be housed at MMRA. The PCU will be composed of three&#13;
full-time professionals, one a solid waste management engineer, another a financial analyst, and&#13;
the third a town planner. This team will be strengthened by short-term assignments by experts&#13;
in various related fields, when necessary. A Technical Coordination Committee (TCC) made&#13;
up of representatives of CDR, MMRA, PMU and PCU monitors progress, coordinates among&#13;
the various organizations, and advises management regarding budgeting and decision - making.&#13;
All participating municipalities will delegate a senior member of their staff to liaise with MMRA&#13;
and the PCU for SWM.&#13;
C. Operation and Maintenance&#13;
3.5   Administratively, Lebanon is divided into six governorates and 25 Cazas (districts).&#13;
Municipal services are provided by the municipalities, which are overseen by the Kaimakam (the&#13;
administrative head of the Caza) and supervised by MMRA. Refuse collection is carried out&#13;
either by municipal workers or contracted out to the private sector. In many Cazas, municipal&#13;
organizations have formed associations and pooled their resources to attain an economy of scale.&#13;
This arrangement has proven to be successful and will be extended to most Cazas. For example,&#13;
in metropolitan Saida the municipal associations have the capacity to deliver an effective solid&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
waste management service. At a later stage during implementation, efforts will be made to&#13;
create municipal associations covering a whole govemorate in order to facilitate supporting&#13;
activities. It will be a condition of allocation of collection equipment to municipalities that they&#13;
either enter into a contract with a competent firm for collection and disposal or show that they&#13;
are capable of performing the function themselves (para. 6.1).&#13;
3.6   After completion of each project component, a joint committee composed of&#13;
representatives of CDR, MMRA, and the relevant municipal organization for the Caza would&#13;
take over the work and then hand it over to the municipality concerned. Before the civil war,&#13;
municipalities were sufficiently staffed and organized to provide adequate services to their&#13;
inhabitants. Two municipal organizations that were not severely affected during the civil war&#13;
have been taken as models and analyzed. Their organization charts and budgets for 1993 are&#13;
shown in Annex 1. With the exception of a general lack of adequate disposal systems, these&#13;
municipalities were able to raise the necessary revenues to provide adequate services.&#13;
D. Cost Recovery&#13;
3.7   In addition to solid waste collection and disposal, municipalities are responsible for street&#13;
paving, sidewalks and parks, municipal police, stormwater drainage, abattoirs, etc., and&#13;
wastewater collection and disposal until this last function is taken over during 1995-1996 by the&#13;
Regional Water Supply and Sanitation Companies which are in process of being created. Not&#13;
untypically, the revenues of the municipalities are rarely of the user charges type and remain&#13;
fungible. In the absence of cost accounting, it is currently impossible to match costs with&#13;
revenues. However, under the project, the cost of providing solid waste services has been&#13;
estimated (Para. 3.9). Furthermore, with the modernization of the accounting systems of the&#13;
municipalities (Para. 2.6 (c)), it will become easier to analyze costs and determine the need to&#13;
adjust the various levies which make up the revenues of the municipalities. This should result&#13;
in enhanced transparency.&#13;
3.8   Recently, the revenues of the municipalities have been substantially increased by revision&#13;
of rental values and are expected to increase further as economic activity picks up and other tax&#13;
bases grow (para. 1.4). The existing tax base would be sufficient to cover other municipal&#13;
activities plus part of the cost of the solid waste management service. It has been agreed to&#13;
create a cost recovery system, which would initially be set at the equivalent of about 25 percent&#13;
of the estimated cost of the collection and disposal of solid waste, and to commence collection&#13;
of charges within a year of starting the new solid waste service (para. 6.1). Supplementing the&#13;
existing charging system will not only contribute to the financial viability of the municipalities&#13;
but will also give the households a clearer price signal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
E. Affordability&#13;
3.9   The annual household cost of service has been calculated for five representative&#13;
municipalities, taking into account, capital costs including engineering studies and construction&#13;
supervision, O&amp;M, replacement cost, and debt service. The actual cost of service varies with&#13;
each municipality depending on the cost of land and other specific characteristics of each&#13;
municipality as follows:&#13;
Average Annual Cost per Household (US$)&#13;
Baalbeck                                 42.80&#13;
Chouf 2                                  48.30&#13;
Saida                                    34.55&#13;
Tyre                                     55.20&#13;
Zahle                                    35.60&#13;
3.10 The above figures are for collection and landfill systems. The alternative using compost&#13;
plants, is justified by the lack of available landfill sites and the value of the compost produced,&#13;
which could be used for both agriculture and pisciculture. The proposed cost recovery scheme&#13;
would ensure that charges for solid waste service are affordable by all households. Through a&#13;
combination of direct and indirect charges, the poor would benefit from a cross-subsidy which&#13;
would result from factors such as population concentration, relative affluence, and number of&#13;
persons per household. There are some 690 municipalities in Lebanon, of which the largest 15&#13;
percent to 20 percent harbor roughly 80 percent to 85 percent of the total population. The&#13;
economic affluence of the larger agglomerations is in dire contrast with that of the smaller ones&#13;
where many of the poor live. Irrespective of location, however, affluent households contribute&#13;
proportionately more to the Municipal Fund because their rental values and their consumption&#13;
of services which form the bases for the revenues of the Municipal Fund are considerably higher&#13;
than those of the poor. Furthermore, because of lack of scale even where they join force to&#13;
provide service, small municipalities experience higher unit costs than large municipalities.&#13;
Finally, the average number of persons per household is generally higher among the less affluent&#13;
population.&#13;
3.11  At present, the taxes making up the bulk of the revenues of the Municipal Fund are&#13;
assessed and collected once a year, creating an additional hardship for the poor. A new cost&#13;
recovery system is being developed which will be implemented one year after commencement&#13;
of waste management services provided under the project. Collection equipment would not be&#13;
allocated to municipalities until a satisfactory cost recovery plan has been prepared (para. 6.1).&#13;

F. Accounting and Auditing&#13;
3.12  CDR will be the designated representative of the Borrower for withdrawing the proceeds&#13;
of the World Bank loan.  CDR will keep separate accounts for project expenditures in&#13;
accordance with internationally acceptable accounting principles and practices. These accounts&#13;
and the Special Account would be audited annually by an independent auditor acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, and copies of the audited statements would be forwarded to the Bank within nine months&#13;
of the end of the CDR's fiscal year. It has been agreed that: (a) CDR would maintain its overall&#13;
accounts in an appropriate format; (b) that these accounts would be audited annually by&#13;
independent and experienced auditors acceptable to the Bank; (c) that the auditors would, in&#13;
addition to the overall audit report for the CDR, prepare and submit a separate opinion on the&#13;
accuracy and appropriateness of the project accounts, SOEs and Special Account to be&#13;
maintained by the CDR; and (d) that the annual audit report and the report on the project&#13;
accounts would be submitted to the Bank within nine months of the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
G. Project Action Plan&#13;
3.13  Annex 7 gives the proposed Action Plan for the project. The two most critical aspects&#13;
of the project are: (i) the timely acquisition of land for the sanitary landfills in the remaining&#13;
Cazas; and (ii) implementation of the cost recovery system.&#13;
IV. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
4.1   Environmental Review Process. While the proposed project is expected to have positive&#13;
environmental impacts by elimination of dumping of solid wastes at roadsides, at open seashore&#13;
dumps, on vacant land and at uncontrolled dump sites, the possibility that some of its&#13;
components could have negative impacts if mismanaged caused it to be subject to a category A&#13;
environmental assessment according to World Bank Operational Directive 4.1. The impacts of&#13;
these components and mitigation measures to be undertaken are described below.&#13;
Compost Plants at Saida and Zahle&#13;
4.2   Project Justification and Benefits.  Composting plants were found to be the best&#13;
technological and economic solutions to solid waste disposal problems for the Cazas of Saida&#13;
and Zahle for the following reasons:&#13;
(a)   the existence of close-by agricultural lands makes it economically and technically&#13;
beneficial for compost to be used for soil improvement;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
(b)   the high proportion of humid (wet) organic matter (52 - 68%) enhances efficient&#13;
compost production and makes incineration technically and economical not&#13;
feasible;&#13;
(c)   landfill volume requirements are greatly reduced (although the need for a landfill&#13;
is not eliminated);&#13;
(d)   the environment is safeguarded through the avoidance of nuisances such as odors,&#13;
water table pollution, insect propagation, epidemic risks and aesthetic&#13;
appearances; and&#13;
(e)   the sorting of recuperable material, namely, plastic, metal, aluminum cans and&#13;
glass, encourages the establishment of recycling industries.&#13;
4.3   Potential Environmental Impacts.  Despite its advantages, the establishment of a&#13;
composting plant may have negative impacts on the surroundings, including:&#13;
(a)   the change in land use at the selected site from agricultural to a waste disposal&#13;
site; and&#13;
(b)   the nuisance to the local population, including noise from plant operations and&#13;
truck traffic, generation of odors at the plant, dust and litter due to truck traffic&#13;
and deterioration in roads due to heavy truck traffic. Environmental mitigation&#13;
measures are presented in the Summary of Environmental Management Activities&#13;
(Attachment 3 to Annex 10).&#13;
4.4   It is important to note that there are negligible effects of the composting plants on surface&#13;
waters, groundwater, geological conditions at the site, fauna and flora, climate, tourist&#13;
attractions and archeological sites.  This is mainly due to the appropriateness of the site&#13;
locations, which were selected on the basis of absence of impact on the aforementioned criteria&#13;
as well as considerations of economy and efficiency and minimal nuisance to human settlements&#13;
(see Attachment 8 of Annex 10).&#13;
4.5    Mitigation Measures. Mitigation measures to minimize the above-mentioned negative&#13;
impacts were developed and a management plan for the application of these measures has been&#13;
established. These measures are based on past experience both in Lebanon and abroad.&#13;
Accordingly, all non-constructed areas will be covered with lawn, and the whole compost plant&#13;
will be surrounded by trees. All circulation areas will have a high quality grade and sub-grade&#13;
capable of withstanding the traffic of heavy trucks and will be paved with washable anti-sliding&#13;
material. Odors will be controlled through a combination of efficient compost fermentation&#13;
management, covering of fermentation area and odor control equipment.  The storage,&#13;
fermentation and maturation areas will be covered. These areas will be equipped with fire&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
extinguisher, fire hydrants and a basin for water storage. The noise pollution will be minimized&#13;
by implementing strict regulations for noise control of equipment, for speed limitation of trucks&#13;
arriving and departing, and by establishing fixed opening and closing hours for the operation of&#13;
the plant. The odor and litter problems will be reduced by placing a reception facility below&#13;
ground level. As for the wastewater generated from the daily use of water, it will be disposed&#13;
of in a septic tank of appropriate capacity. The composting plants will be complemented by&#13;
adjacent sanitary landfills, built according to international standards, capable of handling all the&#13;
non-recyclable sorted refuse from the plants.&#13;
4.6   A summary of the proposed monitoring actions for the compost plants at Zahle and Saida&#13;
is presented in Attachments 3 to 7 of Annex 10, with an identification of the responsible party&#13;
and the associated costs. The primary responsibility for monitoring will be with the compost&#13;
plant operator, especially as to monitoring of odors, groundwater, surface water and quality of&#13;
the compost produced. Laboratory equipment for chemical analysis is included in the project,&#13;
but external laboratory facilities may also be used. Monitoring costs, which will be confirmed&#13;
during final design, are estimated to be of the order of US$40-80,000 per year of direct cost for&#13;
each compost plant operator, mostly for chemical laboratory analysis. It should be noted that&#13;
important measures would be undertaken to ensure that the operation of the compost plant meets&#13;
the standards and objectives it was originally designed for, essentially the transformation of the&#13;
municipal waste into a useful product that can be marketed and used in agriculture. This goal&#13;
can be achieved by (i) ensuring a high quality compost that is suitable for use in the nearby&#13;
agricultural lands; (ii) undertaking a successful marketing campaign to increase people's&#13;
knowledge and awareness and to eliminate their reticence towards using a product generated&#13;
from waste; and (iii) ensuring a good coordination between the various agencies concerned by&#13;
the project, namely the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs, the Ministry of the&#13;
Environment, the Ministry of Agriculture, the municipalities involved, and other non-&#13;
governmental organizations.&#13;
4.7   Environmental Management Activities. A summary of the major environmental impacts,&#13;
and the agreed mitigation measures and monitoring actions, with approximate costs, is provided&#13;
in Attachments 3 to 7 of Annex 10. The tender documents for the Saida and Zahle compost&#13;
plants will require that bidders incorporate these measures into their proposals, including&#13;
provision of sampling and laboratory equipment and estimates of annual monitoring costs.&#13;
Amrousiyeh Complex&#13;
4.8   Environmental Impacts. The EA of the Amrousiyeh Complex indicates that increasing&#13;
the capacity of the existing incinerator is not an environmentally sustainable solution for waste&#13;
disposal in the region of Western Beirut. As the organic (putrescible) materials represent 50-68&#13;
percent (wet weight basis) of the waste with a high water content (62-81%), the existing&#13;
incinerator furnaces require addition of fuel oil to attempt to generate complete combustion.&#13;
Emission stack testing shows that there is still incomplete combustion, even under the best&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
operating conditions with all parameters exceeding international norms. Black smoke, particulate&#13;
matter and odors are common occurrences. The Amrousiyeh incinerator would not, therefore,&#13;
be expanded.&#13;
4.9    Mitigation Measures.  The proposed alternative to the incinerator expansion is the&#13;
construction of a compost plant at the existing site and modernization of the existing furnaces&#13;
at the incinerator, including an air pollution control system to meet international standards.&#13;
Inefficient incineration of the wastes will be resolved by selective collection of wastes with&#13;
higher calorific value wastes and by use of the high calorific value waste separated at the&#13;
compost plant. This solution is an integrated solution that encourages reduction, reuse and&#13;
recycling of waste materials and also makes efficient use of the existing facilities at the site.&#13;
The EA for the complex is being prepared and will be completed prior to Board presentation.&#13;
The mitigation measures will be similar to those described above for the composting plants for&#13;
Saida and Zahle, with the addition of appropriate measures for the incinerator, and a similar&#13;
division of environmental monitoring responsibilities (see Attachments 3 to 7 of Annex 10). The&#13;
monitoring costs at the Amrousiyeh complex may exceed the monitoring costs estimated for the&#13;
other compost plants, as the incinerator will require regular air quality testing, estimated at&#13;
US$25,000 for each perfornance test, to ensure that the operator is in conformance with the&#13;
European Union air regulations. Total costs for monitoring may exceed $100,000 per year, at&#13;
least for the initial years, but are likely to diminish thereafter. The tender documents for the&#13;
complex will require that bidders incorporate full environmental mitigation and monitoring&#13;
measures into their proposals, including provision of sampling and laboratory equipment and&#13;
estimates of annual monitoring costs. The environmental mitigation and monitoring measures&#13;
for the Amrousiyeh Complex will be implemented by CDR.&#13;
4. 10  Guidelines for Selection and Design of Landfills. The selection of sites for landfills&#13;
in Lebanon is a difficult process due to the shortage of suitable sites in the rugged mountainous&#13;
terrain, due to the disruption of effective municipal land use planning procedures during the civil&#13;
war and due to opposition to landfill sites from  those in their vicinity.  The "not in my&#13;
backyard" attitude to accepting landfills appears to be widespread among landowners and the&#13;
public in Lebanon. A general set of criteria have been developed within the EA to: (a) assist&#13;
in the selection of rational sites for landfills; and (b) define basic design principles for landfills.&#13;
The criteria emphasize avoidance of sensitive environmental features, while taking into account&#13;
the need for landfills to be located close to population centers so as to minimize transport&#13;
distances. The criteria are summarized in Attachment 8 to Annex 10. Once the sites will be&#13;
identified, and prior to their acquisition, a specific environmental assessment will be prepared&#13;
for each site (TOR  available on file).   These will systematically  analyze three main&#13;
environmental aspects: (i) justification of site selection; (ii) results of the public consultation&#13;
process; and (iii) site specific design criteria for enviromnental mitigation and protection. These&#13;
EAs will be reviewed by CDR's environmental specialist and by the Bank to establish the&#13;
adequacy of the proposed sites for use as landfills (see also paras. 2.17, 2.22 and 3.3). The&#13;
costs of envirornental monitoring, which would be born by the operators, are expected to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
similar to those for the compost plants. The tender documents for landfills will require that&#13;
bidders incorporate full environmental mitigation and monitoring measures into their proposals,&#13;
including provision of sampling and laboratory equipment and estimates of annual monitoring&#13;
costs.&#13;
4.11  Hospital Wastes. Inventories of hospital waste were carried out for the Cazas of Saida&#13;
and Zahle, and for Western Beirut. These surveys are a first attempt to describe the types and&#13;
quantities of hospital wastes generated in Lebanon. The survey results indicated that hospital&#13;
wastes represent a minor proportion of the overall waste production: less than 1 percent of daily&#13;
waste generation. Hospital wastes consist of mainly domestic wastes (from the kitchens, offices,&#13;
general maintenance services), but infectious wastes (consisting of human tissue, blood and&#13;
laboratory wastes) can, in some hospitals, represent up to 50 percent, as is common in western&#13;
Europe. At two hospitals in Western Beirut, which are equipped with special incinerators,&#13;
hazardous wastes are separated from domestic wastes through the use of colored plastic bags,&#13;
but in other cases both types of hospital wastes are often co-mingled in collection and disposal&#13;
with the other municipal wastes, although some municipalities use separate collection and&#13;
disposal facilities. Under the project, a feasibility study and environmental assessment for the&#13;
location and sizing of a central hospital wastes incinerator will be carried out and funding&#13;
provided for the incinerator and the necessary collection vehicles. The EA will be reviewed by&#13;
CDR's environmental specialist and by the Bank. As an interim measure, (i) systems similar&#13;
to those in use in the Beirut hospitals described above will be established to separate potentially&#13;
infectious wastes from domestic wastes, (ii) collection staff will be trained in separate collection&#13;
of infectious wastes, and (iii) checks of incoming wastes at disposal areas will ensure that no&#13;
infectious bio-medical wastes enter compost plants.&#13;
4.12  Industrial Wastes. Inventories of industrial waste were carried out for the Cazas of&#13;
Saida and Zahle, and for Western Beirut. The inventories were compiled based on systematic&#13;
interviews with owners and managers of local industries. Industries surveyed include slaughter&#13;
houses, rendering plants, chicken and livestock production, tanneries, dye and textile mills, food&#13;
transformation industries, vehicle repair garages and furniture plants. These surveys are a first&#13;
attempt to describe the types and quantities of industrial wastes generated in Lebanon, and the&#13;
results presented in the EAs show that: (i) the quantities are probably under-estimated; and (ii)&#13;
existing disposal practices are basically haphazard, for example, disposal in rivers, on roadsides&#13;
in uncontrolled dumps, mixture with all other plant wastes or burning of used tires. Further&#13;
studies will be undertaken by MOE during project implementation to develop a plan to collect&#13;
separately and dispose of separately the various categories of industrial wastes. As an interim&#13;
measure, collection contractors will be required by municipalities to refuse to collect waste from&#13;
industrial plants, or any other waste suspected of containing hazardous substances. Similarly,&#13;
operators of waste disposal sites will inspect all incoming wastes for hazardous substances.&#13;
4.13  Coastal Zone Management Plan. The first step in the preparation of the coastal zone&#13;
management plan (CZMP) will be a full assessment of the key coastal resources under threat by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
development pressures. A regional environmental assessment (REA, terms of reference available&#13;
on file) will provide a diagnostic of the present situation, and forecast the state of the coastal&#13;
zone and its resources by the year 2010 under various investment scenarios. It will identify the&#13;
main sources of environmental degradation, critical areas and emergency actions, in a study&#13;
corridor up to 16 km wide. This REA will be used for the preparation of land-use policies,&#13;
which can lead to environmentally sustainable patterns. The consultant will commence work in&#13;
1995.&#13;
V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Cost/Benefit Analysis&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
5.1   The principal project benefits will be substantial improvement to the environment:&#13;
cleaning up the accumulated refuse in urban areas and along the Mediterranean coast, improving&#13;
the management of existing disposal sites, creating new ones, and adding composting plants,&#13;
thereby eliminating unsanitary and improper piles of refuse from public areas. The actions to&#13;
be undertaken under the project will benefit the health of all Lebanese, particularly the lower&#13;
income groups. They will also eliminate one of the major impediments to attracting foreign&#13;
business and tourism which are essential to the country's economic development. The&#13;
beneficiaries include the entire population, many of which, for years, have been deprived of&#13;
adequate solid waste collection and disposal or did not get service at all in spite of paying some&#13;
of the cost of service through various taxes and assessments.  Additionally, the principal&#13;
municipalities will receive training and other technical assistance, including the modernization&#13;
of their accounting and information systems (para. 2.6(c)), all of which will help to strengthen&#13;
them as institutions. Private sector participation in the solid-waste management business will&#13;
be encouraged through contracting to municipalities, which should increase efficiency by&#13;
introducing an element of competition. Employment generation will also be enhanced through&#13;
the opportunities offered by presorting and increased recycling, particularly for lower income&#13;
groups.&#13;
Least-Cost Solution&#13;
5.2   During project preparation, consultants analyzed the various options for collecting,&#13;
processing and disposing of solid waste. The collection aspect was a choice between door-to-&#13;
door collection and the placing of containers at convenient locations; the latter was selected for&#13;
reasons of efficiency and affordability. For disposal, various alternatives, including landfills,&#13;
composting and incineration were carefully analyzed. Based on the topography, population&#13;
concentration, and the availability of suitable land, the alternative selected in each of the areas&#13;
represents the optimal and least-cost solution (see Annex 8, "Affordable Solid Waste&#13;
Management Services").&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Incremental Costs and Benefits&#13;
5.3   The incremental costs for the Project consist of the project costs, including land&#13;
acquisition, buildings and workshops, compactor trucks, containers, landfill equipment, compost&#13;
plants, incinerators, and engineering services; the cost of eventual equipment replacement over&#13;
a designated time period; and the additional recurrent costs required to operate the new facilities&#13;
and equipment. These have been satisfactorily established.&#13;
5.4   Incremental benefits consist mainly of the favorable impact of the project on the country's&#13;
environment and the health of the population, particularly in protecting its rivers and coastal&#13;
waters. Some of the waste material will be recovered and sold for recycling. Likewise, where&#13;
composting proves feasible, the compost will be sold to interested farmers. Benefits also include&#13;
the ability to service the country's entire urban population, and the virtual elimination of&#13;
unhealthy piles of refuse from populated neighborhoods and beaches. Finally, appropriate&#13;
collection and disposal of solid waste will enhance the aesthetic values of a country rich in&#13;
touristic potential.&#13;
5.5   While incremental costs are known, incremental benefits cannot be quantified.&#13;
Therefore, an economic internal rate of return has not been calculated for the project.&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
5.6   The main risks involved with the project are: (i) if suitable cost recovery mechanisms are&#13;
not put in place, the projected levels of service for collection and disposal will not be maintained&#13;
nor improve upon existing conditions; and (ii) scarcity of land for sanitary landfills could make&#13;
it difficult to acquire sites and slow down project implementation.&#13;
5.7   An ongoing study is looking into the financial resources of the municipalities and will put&#13;
forward recommendations for the improvement of the resource base of municipalities. The&#13;
project provides for technical assistance to MMRA and the municipalities for modernization and&#13;
staff training. A detailed time-bound schedule for land acquisition was be agreed at negotiations&#13;
and a special fund for land acquisition has been activated by CDR to assist the municipalities in&#13;
providing land. Authorities directly involved with waste management, MMRA and the&#13;
municipalities, are convinced of the economic and environmental advantages of landfills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.1   The following assurances were obtained at negotiations and recorded in the Loan&#13;
documents:&#13;
(i)   the rehabilitation plans of the old dumps will be reviewed by the Bank before&#13;
implementation to ensure environmentally acceptable solutions (para. 2.5);&#13;
(ii)   a cofinancing agreement for the equivalent to US$55 million shall be signed with&#13;
Japan or alternative sources of funding found (para. 2.8);&#13;

each in conjunction with the annual audit of CDR's accounts (para. 2.16);&#13;
(iv)  the environmental mitigation and monitoring measures recommended for the&#13;
compost plants at Saida and Zahle will be implemented by CDR (para. 4.7 and&#13;
Attachments 3 to 7 of Annex 10);&#13;
(v)   the environmental mitigation and monitoring measures recommended for the&#13;
Amrousiyeh complex will be implemented by CDR (para. 4.9);&#13;
(vi)  preparation of future environmental assessments for all landfills and the hospital&#13;

will: (a) continue to employ a senior environmental specialist to manage EA&#13;
activities; (b) obtain the Bank's no objection to each EA report prior to awards&#13;
of contracts for site development; (c) acquire environmentally acceptable sites as&#13;
recommended by each EA report and in accordance with the agreed timetable; (d)&#13;
ensure that no sites will be acquired if involuntary resettlement is involved; and&#13;
(e) ensure that the environmental mitigation and monitoring measures&#13;
recommended in each EA are implemented by CDR (paras. 2.17, 2.22, 3.3, 4.9,&#13;
4.10 and 4.11);&#13;
(vii)  Conditions of allocation of collection equipment to participating municipalities&#13;
will be: (a) acquisition of environmentally acceptable land for all landfills and&#13;
disposal plants and their transfer to the project (para. 2.22); (b) entering into a&#13;
contract with a competent firm for collection and disposal or providing evidence&#13;
of their own capability to perform the function (paras. 2.28 &amp; 3.5); and (c)&#13;
presentation of an acceptable cost recovery program (para. 3.11); in those cases&#13;
where CDR has acquired the landfills on an exceptional basis, CDR shall enter&#13;
into appropriate arrangements with private sector contractors and formulate cost&#13;
recovery plans;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
(viii) CDR would submit: (a) semi-anniual progress reports within 30 days of the end&#13;
of each semester; (b) the detailed report for the mid-term review by December&#13;
31, 1998; and (c) the project implementation report and a plan for future&#13;
operation of the project within six months after loan closing (para. 2.27);&#13;
(ix)   a cost recovery system acceptable to the Bank will commence within one year of&#13;
starting the new solid waste management service (para. 3.8); and&#13;
(x)   (a) CDR would maintain its overall accounts in an appropriate format; (b) that&#13;
these accounts would be audited annually by independent and experienced auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank; (c) that the auditors would, in addition to the overall audit&#13;
report for the CDR, prepare and submit a separate opinion on the accuracy and&#13;
appropriateness of the project accounts, SOEs and Special Account to be&#13;
maintained by the CDR; and (d) that the annual audit report and the report on the&#13;
project accounts would be submitted to the Bank within nine months of the end&#13;
of each fiscal year (para. 3.12).&#13;
6.2   Given the understandings reached under para. 6.1, Items i - x above, the proposed project&#13;
provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$55.0 million to the Lebanese Republic at the&#13;
LBRD standard variable rate, with 17-year maturity, including 5 years of grace.&#13;

SOLID WASTE/ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
1.     As indicated under Para. 2.6 of the SAR, three experts in municipal management will&#13;
each serve for a period of two years at MMRA to set up the various operational systems and&#13;
train MMRA staff in SWM activities. In addition to their duties at MMRA, they will be&#13;
responsible for the setting up of similar systems at the principal municipalities, which are the&#13;
centers of their respective Cazas, and for training municipal staff in SWM. Their principal&#13;
responsibilities will be to: (i) set up adequate collection and disposal systems in the Cazas,&#13;
including the planning of collection routes, periodicity of collection, and maintenance and&#13;
servicing of collection equipment; (ii) set up a modern accounting system both at MMRA and&#13;
the municipalities, help computerize the accounting systems, and advise on achieving full cost&#13;
recoverY; (iii) plan the location of collection bins, estimate the effect of waste collection on&#13;
urban traffic, and maximize the utilization of the roads through proper scheduling of collection;&#13;
(iv) introduce upstream sorting of the waste and advise on the possibilities of creating small&#13;
industries based on recycled material; and (v) organize an educational campaign to teach citizens&#13;
the benefits of proper SWM.&#13;
2.     The following paragraphs give the profiles of the three experts who will provide technical&#13;
assistance to MMRA. In addition to their duties at MMRA and the municipalities, the Technical&#13;
Assistance Team (TAT) will coordinate project implementation with the PMU at CDR, which&#13;
will also be strengthened under the project by the addition of a senior environmental specialist&#13;
to assist in reviewing environmental assessments (see Annex 10.1 for TOR). Short term experts&#13;
would be available as necessary, particularly to provide assistance to municipalities on their&#13;
specific needs. The Table below shows an estimate of the cost of technical assistance.&#13;

SOLID WASTE/ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Affordable Solid Waste Management Services&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.   Income levels in Lebanon are significantly lower than they were before the outbreak of&#13;
war - probably about one third of what they used to be in real terms (current estimates are of&#13;
average household incomes of US$400 per month based on a minimum wage of US$225 per&#13;
month). Yet, in many cases, expectations of service standards remain high, influenced by the&#13;
pre-war standards. The objective of the project is to provide a level of service that is affordable&#13;
to the majority of the population, so that households will be willing and able to pay for the&#13;
service provided, and hence ensure the sustainability of the project. The analysis that follows&#13;
sets out the rationale behind the proposed service levels and systems of collection and disposal.&#13;
COMPOSITION OF SOLID WASTE&#13;
2.    Analysis of solid waste in Beirut and Tripoli carried out over the past two years shows&#13;
it to have a high organic content, 60-70 percent, and hence a high moisture content which&#13;
renders it on the whole unsuitable for incineration, but more suitable for composting. This is&#13;
confirmed by the difficulties encountered in operation of the incinerator at Amrousiyeh during&#13;
the past year, where combustion has frequently been incomplete, with consequent pollution of&#13;
the atmosphere. On many occasions it has been necessary to add fuel oil to achieve combustion.&#13;
The solution proposed in the project to overcome these technical difficulties at Amrousiyeh is&#13;
to construct a composting plant beside the incinerator and to sort the incoming waste, directing&#13;
it to the most appropriate disposal system and so raising the calorific value of the waste diverted&#13;
to the incinerator.&#13;
ALTERNATIVE COLLECTION SYSTEMS&#13;
3.    During preparation of the ERRP, consideration was given to the choice between house-to-&#13;
house collection and the placing of containers at convenient locations throughout urban areas.&#13;
The latter proved to be the more cost effective procedure, being considerably more rapid and&#13;
hence involving less capital and operating costs (US$25 per ton). Nevertheless it required the&#13;
cooperation of the public to carry their garbage over a normally short distance to the container.&#13;
The implementation of this system has proved effective in Beirut under the ERRP and its&#13;
extension to other urban areas is proposed under the project.&#13;

1 /    Moisture content is available for Beirut only.&#13;
4.    Another choice that is becoming increasingly widespread in many countries is the sorting&#13;
of waste at the household level, primarily to assist recycling of waste for reuse and&#13;
environmental protection purposes. This system requires more complex collection and disposal&#13;
procedures and a high degree of public participation. While it may become possible to introduce&#13;
such a system in Lebanon in the future, it will take time to develop public awareness of the&#13;
advantages of such a system and establish the facilities needed for its implementation. In the&#13;
meantime, the priority is to establish a workable system throughout the country as rapidly as&#13;
possible. An exception is hospital waste which for obvious reasons needs to be separated at&#13;
source and for which separate facilities will be provided under the project.&#13;
5.    Industrial and hazardous wastes from large plants are excluded from collection in this&#13;
project, but it is acknowledged that there is still considerable mixing of household and industrial&#13;
wastes in most small and medium sized industries. Strengthening of the legal framework and&#13;
of enforcement capabilities is required to ensure full separation of industrial and hazardous&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 8&#13;

wastes. Separate specialized collection and disposal facilities will have to be developed under&#13;
a separate project, as these are much more expensive facilities to build and to operate.&#13;
ALTERNATIVE DISPOSAL SY'STEMS&#13;
6.    Three alternative systems of disposal were analyzed during project preparation:&#13;
* sanitary landfills;&#13;
* composting; and&#13;
* incineration.&#13;
7.    Each system of disposal has certain advantages and disadvantages in the context of&#13;
Lebanon. Sanitary landfills, while cheap to construct and operate, suffer from scarcity of&#13;
appropriate sites - the mountainous terrain and high population density make it difficult to find&#13;
low cost sites adjacent to urban areas. Composting has acquired a bad reputation amongst the&#13;
farmer end users due to poor quality compost produced in the past, although better sorting and&#13;
production control, already introduced at the Karantina compost plant under the ERRP, should&#13;
eliminate this problem in future. Studies indicate that there is sufficient demand for composting&#13;
to be viable. Incineration appeared to be a possible option initially due to the availability of&#13;
industrial sites for what is regarded as an industrial process, but its high investment and&#13;
operating costs make it unaffordable and hence unsustainable at this stage, apart from&#13;
environmental problems associated with air emissions and disposal of hazardous fly ash.&#13;
8.    A further major constraint in Lebanon is the unwillingness of any caza to accept the&#13;
refuse of another caza. This means that separate facilities have to be provided in each caza&#13;
within its constraints, thus reducing choices and scope for economies of scale. For example, in&#13;
Beirut land scarcity has resulted in disposal systems based on composting and incineration; in&#13;
Tripoli, the existing sanitary landfill will be rehabilitated, while the future choice between&#13;
landfills, composting and incineration, or a combination, is analyzed and debated, despite&#13;
available capacity at landfills in adjoining cazas.&#13;
9.    Estimates of the costs of alternative disposal systems are summarized in the table below -&#13;
they are based on recent consultants' reports for sanitary landfills (in Tripoli, Saida, Zahle,&#13;
Tyre and Baalbek). composting plants (in Beirut, Tripoli, Saida and Zahle), and incineration (in&#13;
Beirut and Tripoli). Although these estimates are indicative of orders of magnitude only, they&#13;
are consistent with data available from other countries in the region (see, for example,&#13;
"Municipal Solid Waste Management Study for the Mediterranean Region", a study prepared&#13;
for METAP by Cowiconsult in September, 1992).&#13;

10.   Sanitary Landfill costs will vary according to the price of land and the extent of&#13;
preparation needed for the site. For example, in most of the proposed landfills a double layer&#13;
of impermeabilization (impermeable geomembrane and impermeable clay layer) is proposed to&#13;
ensure effective protection against possible contamination of water resources; on coastal landfill&#13;
sites, a dyke would be built to ensure against spilling of refuse into the sea; land prices are&#13;
significantly lower in the Bekaa Valley than on the coastal zone. Overall costs of collection and&#13;
disposal would amount to US$40-50 per household per year, less than 1 % of average household&#13;
income.&#13;
11.   Composting represents a viable alternative method to landfill, particularly in agricultural&#13;
areas where there is potential demand from farmers, as in the Bekaa (Zahle), in the southern&#13;
coastal area (Saida and Tyre) and in the northern Akkar region (Tripoli). The costs shown in&#13;
the table take no account of revenue from sales (manure is currently priced at about US$30 per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
ton. Even so, the combined costs of collection and disposal would be affordable at about US$60&#13;
per household per year.&#13;
12.   Incineration is a significantly more costly process, particularly in Lebanon, where the&#13;
high technology is new and the high moisture content of the garbage makes it difficult to burn.&#13;
For incineration to work in these circumstances, it would need to be combined with other&#13;
disposal systems - composting and/or sanitary landfills - that can dispose of high moisture&#13;
refuse. Incineration would in any event require complementary landfill facilities to dispose of&#13;
residues, which can represent up to 30% of total waste incinerated. In the future the relative&#13;
disadvantages of incineration may change, as the technology becomes absorbed, income levels&#13;
rise, the composition of the solid-waste changes and it becomes possible to reduce the costs by&#13;
selling surplus power generated to the national grid. Then its use may become attractive on a&#13;
selective basis to extend the life of scarce landfill volume capacity, despite its relatively high&#13;
capital and operating costs.&#13;

ENVIRONMIENTAL ASSESSMENT SUMMARY&#13;
1.00 Background&#13;
1.01  Lebanon, a prosperous upper middle-income country in the mid-70s, has been devastated&#13;
by 15 years of turmoil as a result of violent civil strife and military occupation. The civil war&#13;
had a severe impact on the socio-economic conditions in the country. Lebanon's per capita&#13;
income, about US$1,900 in 1993, in real terms was only about half of the 1975 level, and&#13;
income inequalities have been accentuated. The total damage to physical assets during the war&#13;
period was estimated by the United Nations at US$25 billion. Damage is both a direct result&#13;
of the war, as well as the accumulated effects of a near total disruption in capital investment and&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
1.02 Against this background, the Government of Lebanon has prepared a three-year National&#13;
Emergency Reconstruction Program (NERP) which has recently been extended to the ten-year&#13;
Horizon 2000 program. The first five years of the Horizon 2000 include the NERP and total&#13;
approximately US$5 billion (in constant 1992 prices).&#13;
The Solid Waste Management Sector&#13;
1.03   Solid waste collection and disposal services deteriorated greatly during the civil war.&#13;
Refuse collection trucks and containers, often used as barricades during the fighting, were&#13;
destroyed. The remaining equipment has either lived beyond its effective life or prematurely&#13;
damaged because of lack of maintenance. Thus, refuse collection services deteriorated to the&#13;
point where refuse collection became almost non-existent and solid waste was dumped on the&#13;
streets, vacant lots and the coastline, with frequent intermingling of hospital and other hazardous&#13;
wastes.&#13;
1.04  Although Lebanon's physical features sometimes make it difficult to find sites for sanitary&#13;
landfills with suitably large capacity for refuse disposal, this is still the least cost and simplest&#13;
method of disposal. Composting is also considered an appropriate technology for the disposal&#13;
of large volumes of waste, particularly where there is a potential market for the product, as&#13;
market studies (available on file) indicate for agricultural areas. Incineration is rarely a viable&#13;
option in Lebanon due to the substantial investment cost, high ratio of organic matter in the&#13;
refuse, and the extremely high operating costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
1.05 Refuse collection and disposal have always been the responsibility of the municipal&#13;
authorities. The service is funded, along with other municipal services, from the fungible&#13;
revenues of the municipalities. These consist of: (i) a municipal tax equivalent to 11 percent of&#13;
the imputed rental value of property, and the proceeds from land sales and construction permits,&#13;
all of which are collected directly by the municipalities; and (ii) a share of certain revenues, such&#13;
as a 10 percent surcharge on telephone, electricity and water bills, and duties on imports, liquor&#13;
and fuel, collected by the Central Government and distributed to the municipalities on the basis&#13;
of population and the size of the previous budget, Beirut being limited to 60 percent of the total&#13;
under the existing formula. In the past, municipalities were capable of providing adequate refuse&#13;
collection services, although the development of sound disposal systems had only just started&#13;
when the civil war broke out. With time, the resource base of the municipalities was eroded&#13;
because: (i) the Lebanese Pound has slid to about one-thousandth of its value in 1975; (ii)&#13;
Lebanon, until July 1992, practiced absolute rent control, leaving revenues from the municipal&#13;
tax frozen in terms of Lebanese Pounds; recently, however, rental values have increased&#13;
between 15- and 80- fold, according to the age of the property; (iii) there has been a drop in the&#13;
revenues from electricity, water and telephones; however, the revenues from surcharges on these&#13;
services are expected to increase substantially as the major service bottlenecks are removed with&#13;
the help of the NERP, and follow-on projects; and (iv) because of Central Govermment&#13;
budgetary constraints, the share of the municipalities has not been paid from the Municipal Fund&#13;
although transfers are expected to resume in the not too distant future. Pending resumption of&#13;
transfers from the Municipal Fund, the municipalities have to rely in part on ad-hoc advances&#13;
from the Central Government to meet priority needs. Government has recently undertaken a&#13;
study (funded by the Bank) for the development of a long-term strategy for solid-waste&#13;
management, anchored on the achievement of full cost recovery in the sector through the&#13;
introduction of direct user charges.&#13;
Environmental Management&#13;
1.06 One of the results of the civil war in Lebanon was the deterioration of public services,&#13;
particularly water supply, waste water disposal, solid waste collection, power supply, and public&#13;
transport. The deterioration of solid waste services has created a severe risk to public health&#13;
and the environment due to: pollution of water sources and distribution systems; discharge of&#13;
waste directly into the sea and into irrigation canals; scattered piles of solid waste throughout&#13;
the country; mixing of hospital waste with domestic waste; and air pollution caused by burning&#13;
of solid-waste. The situation has been further exacerbated by the lack of a country-wide land&#13;
use system which has led to haphazard expansion of dwellings on the sea coast, on fertile&#13;
agricultural land and on sensitive natural ecosystems; pollution of surface waters and&#13;
underground aquifers caused by uncontrolled pumping to provide the new communities with&#13;
running water; pouring of sewage into disused wells; widespread deforestation; destruction of&#13;
the cultural heritage; and degradation of marine and coastal areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
1.07 The coastal zone has been particularly affected by these impacts, and is suffering severe&#13;
environmental degradation. The destruction of the Central Business District (CBD) of Beirut&#13;
and the separation of communities during 15 years of strife, led to the development of major&#13;
commercial and industrial centers along the sea coast, which themselves triggered the&#13;
construction of large housing settlements for employees. The sea coast from Tripoli in the&#13;
North to Tyre in the South has become a continuous stretch of densely populated urban&#13;
settlements, many of which are lacking in services. In several areas along the coastline, solid&#13;
waste dumps and outfalls of untreated sewage pollute the sea, while emissions from traffic,&#13;
power stations, cement plants and other industries, mostly using fuel of doubtful cleanliness,&#13;
contribute to the atmospheric pollution.&#13;
1.08 Lebanon is in the process of preparing a comprehensive national framework for&#13;
environmental protection. Recently, there have been several initiatives towards strengthening&#13;
the recently created Ministry of Environment (MOE) to enable it to carry out its role of setting,&#13;
monitoring and enforcing environmental standards.  Assistance is being provided by the&#13;
Mediterranean Environment Technical Assistance Program (METAP) for the preparation of a&#13;
national environmental strategy, which will identify the priorities for action and the policy,&#13;
institutional and investment tools for their implementation. This will contribute to the definition&#13;
of the MOE long-term program and provide inputs to establish the broad institutional framework&#13;
for environmental management. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is&#13;
providing a complementary program of technical assistance and training to MOE for the review&#13;
and consolidation of environmental laws and regulations, institutional development, capacity&#13;
building for environmental assessment, and creation of public awareness and participation&#13;
mechanisms. Although the enforcement of environmental regulations is feasible under the&#13;
existing legal framework, it is expected that actions will be accelerated when the revised&#13;
framework is approved by Parliament later in 1995. MOE has recently moved into new&#13;
premises, which will permit an expansion of staff from the present level of approximately 20&#13;
people to the planned level of about 150 people.&#13;
1.09 The Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR), which has the overall&#13;
responsibility for planning and coordination of investment programs, also needs strengthening&#13;
in its environmental review functions.  In view of the need to integrate environmental&#13;
considerations at the earliest stage of the planning process, CDR will use the services of the&#13;
European Union (EU) funded Program Management Unit (PMU) to provide a senior&#13;
environmental expert to train CDR staff and to coordinate environmental review activities. The&#13;
expert, who will be in post by March 31, 1995, will also coordinate the inclusion of&#13;
environmental mitigation and monitoring actions into the construction and operation of disposal&#13;
sites.&#13;

2.00 Project Description&#13;
2.01  Project Objectives. The main objectives of the project are to: (i) eliminate hazardous&#13;
and unsightly dumping of solid-waste; (ii) improve methods of waste collection and disposal; (iii)&#13;
improve cost recovery and modernize municipal accounting systems; (iv) improve the quality&#13;
and marketability of compost, through the introduction of sorting of the waste at the entrance&#13;
to the compost plant; (v) increase the involvement of the private sector in solid waste&#13;
management; (vi) strengthen CDR and MMRA and the principal municipalities; and (vii) create&#13;
instruments for the more orderly planning and development of the Lebanese coastal zone.&#13;
Basically, the project would complete the rehabilitation of the country's municipal solid-waste&#13;
collection and disposal systems as envisaged under the NERP and introduce a separate system&#13;
for hospital waste.&#13;
2.02 Major Project Components. The project has four main components: (i) collection&#13;
equipment; (ii) landfill civil works; (iii) waste disposal facilities; (iv) technical assistance&#13;
including a coastal zone management plan.&#13;
2.03 Collection Equipment Component:&#13;
(a)   Containers: These will be 5,200 in number, distributed across the country in&#13;
accordance with the estimated population densities. Of this total, 1,600 will be&#13;
in galvanized steel of 1100 liters with covers for use in urban centers along the&#13;
coastline. The remaining 3,600 containers will be in painted steel of 1500 liter&#13;
capacity.&#13;
(b)   Compactor Trucks: The compactor trucks will be standardized at 10 cubic meters&#13;
capacity, as these are suited to the narrow streets of the major cities and winding,&#13;
steep hills typically found in Lebanon. The project will finance 180 new&#13;
compactor trucks, and distribution will be in accordance with estimated&#13;
population.&#13;
(c)   Special Equipment: Where necessary, provision has been made in the project for&#13;
the procurement of special equipment. These include street sweeping and&#13;
washing equipment for Beirut and trailer trucks for the purpose of transporting&#13;
large quantities of waste from transfer stations that will be built in cazas where&#13;
it is practically impossible to find land for a sanitary landfill.&#13;
2.04 Landfill Civil Works Component:&#13;
(a)   Sanitary Landfills:  The 15 landfills are being selected in accordance with&#13;
approved site selection criteria. Of the 13 landfills being financed under the&#13;
ERRP, the land has been acquired for 6 Cazas; the rest are still in the selection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 5 of 10&#13;
and evaluation process. Sites for landfills to be financed under the proposed&#13;
project will be selected on the basis of environmental assessments agreed by the&#13;
executing agency and the Bank. The landfills will be located at suitable distances&#13;
from urban developments. The area will be sufficient to meet the needs of the&#13;
Caza for 20 years. Each sanitary landfill will be enclosed with a suitable fence&#13;
to prevent encroachment by scavengers and stray animals. A guardhouse and&#13;
weighbridge will be located at the entrance to each site, enabling access to be&#13;
controlled and the source of waste and its weight to be recorded. A suitable&#13;
garage on site will house all the equipment belonging to the Caza and will provide&#13;
routine maintenance services. An administration building will house the staff in&#13;
charge of operating and maintaining both the landfill and the mobile equipment.&#13;
Each site will be provided with the necessary earth-moving and compacting&#13;
equipment. This will vary in quantity and size depending on the size of the&#13;
landfill and the volume of incoming waste. Generally, each site will be provided&#13;
with a mechanical shovel, a water tanker and a sheep's-foot type earth compactor.&#13;
(b)   Closure and Rehabilitation of Old Uncontrolled Dumps: The old uncontrolled&#13;
dumps in each of these cazas will be closed and rehabilitated. The rehabilitation&#13;
will be carried out in accordance with cost effective standards, and the design&#13;
concepts will be reviewed by the Bank.&#13;
2.05 Waste Disposal Facilities Component:&#13;
(a)   Compost Plants: Two compost plants will be constructed; with one in Saida (200&#13;
tons per day), and one in Zahle (200 tons per day). Before the waste enters the&#13;
process cycle, large, hard lumps of debris will be separated and sorted out.&#13;
Then, as the waste is conveyed towards a shredding/homogenizing drum,&#13;
recyclable materials - glass, plastics, paper, cloth, and bones - will be manually&#13;
separated and dropped from special chutes to a compacting and baling unit for&#13;
sale to manufacturing industries. Ferrous metals will be separated magnetically.&#13;
The homogenized compost will be mechanically aerated and turned, then&#13;
deposited in windrows until maturation. This will result in the production of&#13;
homogeneous, high-quality compost which can be marketed primarily to the&#13;
farming community.&#13;
(b)   Amrousiyeh Complex: The original design of the incinerator at Amrousiyeh had&#13;
made provision for a third furnace of 10 tons per hour incineration capacity.&#13;
Experience with the existing furnaces has not been satisfactory because of the&#13;
high moisture content of the waste. Fuel oil is now used to improve combustion&#13;
and the air emissions consist of black smoke and other contaminants related to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
incomplete oxidation of the combustion gases. The Environmental Assessment&#13;
(EA) report, now under preparation, has made preliminary recommendations that&#13;
the incinerator capacity should not be expanded, and that a compost plant, similar&#13;
to that described above (see (a) Compost Plants) be constructed. The alternative&#13;
project concept, which has been adopted for this project, consists of a compost&#13;
plant and use of the existing incinerator. The incinerator will be modernized to&#13;
improve the combustion process by (i) improved califoric value in the waste feed&#13;
by selective collection of a minimum of 120 tones (metric) per day of waste from&#13;
higher income neighborhoods, (ii) high calorific value sorted wastes from the&#13;
compost plant, and (iii) improved mechanical and control equipment. The&#13;
objective is to meet the European Union Directive on Municipal Waste&#13;
Incineration Plants (89/429/EEC - OJ L203, 15 July 1989).&#13;
(c)   Incinerator for Hospital Waste: An appropriately designed incinerator will be&#13;
constructed for the disposal of hospital waste from hospitals throughout Lebanon.&#13;
Its precise location and capacity will be determined by feasibility and&#13;
environmental studies to be undertaken during project implementation&#13;
Appropriate transport will be procured to transport hospital waste to the&#13;
incinerator.&#13;
2.06 Technical Assistance Component:&#13;
(a)   Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Plan: This component aims at creating the&#13;
instruments and building the institutional capacities for the physical planning and&#13;
monitoring of the coastal zone development, in order to improve environmental&#13;
conditions and prevent further degradation.  Its outputs would include: (i)&#13;
preparing a regional environmental assessment which will identify the cumulative&#13;
pressures and impacts of the coastal zone development under different investment&#13;
scenarios; (ii) establishing a GIS system for physical planning and monitoring of&#13;
the coastal zone development for use by CDR, MMRA and the municipalities;&#13;
(iii) preparing a coastal zone management plan to be approved and legally binding&#13;
on all future developments on the coast; and (iv) initiating the implementation of&#13;
emergency actions to protect and/or rehabilitate coastal resources. The coastal&#13;
zone management plan will include: a) a strategy for the allocation of coastal and&#13;
marine resources, defining areas to be conserved and protected and policies for&#13;
zoning and development of economic activities in the coast; b) a regulatory needs&#13;
assessment and preparation of draft guidelines, rules and regulations for control&#13;
of activities on the coast; and c) mechanisms for recurrent funding to support&#13;
CZM activities and encourage public/private partnership.&#13;
(b)   Engineering Services: The designs of compactor trucks, containers, and landfills&#13;
have been completed, or are in the process of being completed, under the ERRP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 7 of 10&#13;
Engineering services will be needed for assistance to CDR in bid evaluation, and&#13;
supervision of construction. Full engineering services will be provided for the&#13;
(i) design and construction supervision of the two compost plants in Saida and&#13;
Zahle; (ii) design and construction of the Amrousiyeh Complex, and (iii) design&#13;
and construction supervision for the collection and incineration of hospital waste.&#13;
(c)   Institutional Technical Assistance and Training: As CDR, MOE and MMRA are&#13;
newly established institutions, their staff requires training in the development and&#13;
implementation of their responsibilities. MOE is already receiving technical&#13;
assistance from UNDP for institutional development over the mid to long term.&#13;
In the short term CDR will receive immediate strengthening to review and&#13;
manage enviromnental assessments for the project components of landfills,&#13;
hospital waste incinerator and the Amrousiyeh Complex. As the implementing&#13;
agency, CDR will be responsible for these environmental assessments (EAs), and&#13;
the Bank will review all EA reports. The termns of reference for a senior&#13;
environmental specialist are presented in Annex 2. The project will provide&#13;
supplementary assistance to MMRA, by recruiting three international experts who&#13;
will each serve for two years, providing technical assistance and on-the-job&#13;
training of MMRA staff on solid waste and municipal management. Finally, the&#13;
project would provide for the training of technical staff from MMRA and the&#13;
municipalities.&#13;
3.00 Environmental Aspects&#13;
3.01  Environmental Review Process:  While the proposed project is expected to have&#13;
positive environmental impacts by elimination of indiscriminate dumping of solid wastes at&#13;
roadsides, at open seashore dumps, on vacant land and at uncontrolled dump sites, the possibility&#13;
that some of its components could have negative impacts if mismanaged caused it to be subject&#13;
to a category A environmental assessment according to World Bank Operational Directive 4.01.&#13;
The impacts of these components and mitigation measures to be undertaken are described below.&#13;
Compost Plants at Saida and Zahle&#13;
3.02   Project Justification and Benefits: Composting plants were found to be the best&#13;
technological and economic solutions to solid waste disposal problems fore the Cazas of Saida&#13;
and Zahle for the following reasons:&#13;
(a)   the existence of close-by agricultural lands makes it economically and technically&#13;
beneficial for compost to be used for soil improvement;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 8 of 10&#13;
(b)   the high proportion of humid (wet) organic matter (52%  - 68%) enhances&#13;
efficient compost production and makes incineration technically and economical&#13;
not feasible;&#13;
(c)   landfill volume requirements are greatly reduced (although  the need for a&#13;
landfill is not eliminated);&#13;
(d)   the environment is safeguarded through the avoidance of nuisances such as odors,&#13;
water table pollution, insect propagation, epidemic risks and aesthetic&#13;
appearances; and&#13;
(e)   the sorting of recuperable material namely plastic, metal, aluminum cans and&#13;
glass encourages the establishment of recycling industries.&#13;
3.03  Potential Environmental Impacts:  Despite its advantages, the establishment of a&#13;
composting plant may have negative impacts on the surroundings, including:&#13;
(a)   the change in land use at the selected site from agricultural to a waste disposal&#13;
site; and&#13;
(b)   the nuisance to the local population, including noise from plant operations and&#13;
truck traffic, generation of odors at the plant, dust and litter due to truck traffic&#13;
and deterioration in roads due to heavy truck traffic.&#13;
It is important to note that there are negligible effects of the composting plants on surface&#13;
waters, groundwater, geological conditions at the site, fauna and flora, climate, tourist&#13;
attractions and archeological sites.  This is mainly due to the appropriateness of the site&#13;
locations.&#13;
3.04   Mitigation Measures. Mitigation measures to minimize the above mentioned negative&#13;
impacts were developed and a management plan for the application of these measures has been&#13;
established. These measures are based on past experience both in Lebanon and abroad.&#13;
Accordingly, all non constructed areas will be covered with lawn, and the whole compost plant&#13;
will be surrounded by trees. All circulation areas will have a high quality grade and sub-grade&#13;
capable of withstanding the traffic of heavy trucks and will be paved with washable anti-sliding&#13;
material. The storage, fermentation and maturation areas will be covered. These areas will be&#13;
equipped with fire extinguishers, fire hydrants and a basin for water storage. The noise&#13;
pollution will be minimized by implementing strict regulations for noise control of equipment,&#13;
for speed limitation of trucks arriving and departing, and by establishing fixed opening and&#13;
closing hours for the operation of the plant. The odor and litter problems will be reduced by&#13;
placing a reception facility below ground level. As for the wastewater generated from the daily&#13;
use of water, it will be treated in a septic tank of appropriate capacity. The composting plants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 9 of 10&#13;
will be complemented by adjacent sanitary landfills, built according to international standards,&#13;
capable of handling all the non-recyclable sorted refuse from the plants. It should be noted that&#13;
important measures would be undertaken to ensure that the operation of the compost plant meets&#13;
the standards and objectives it was originally designed for, essentially the transformation of the&#13;
municipal waste into a useful product that can be marketed and used in agriculture. This goal&#13;
can be achieved by (i) ensuring a high quality compost that is suitable for use in the nearby&#13;
agricultural lands; (ii) undertaking a successful marketing campaign to increase people's&#13;
knowledge and awareness and to eliminate their reticence towards using a product generated&#13;
from waste; and (iii) ensuring a good coordination between the various agencies concerned by&#13;
the project, namely the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Green&#13;
Plan, the municipalities involved, and other non-governmental organizations.&#13;
Amrousiyeh Complex&#13;
3.05   Environmental Impacts.   Increasing the capacity of the existing Amrousiyeh&#13;
incinerator is not an environmentally sustainable solution for waste disposal in the region of&#13;
western Beirut. As the organic (putrescible) materials represent 50-68% (wet weight basis) of&#13;
the waste with a high water content (62-81 %), the existing incinerator oven requires addition of&#13;
fuel oil to assist in combustion. Emission stack testing shows that there is still incomplete&#13;
combustion, and black smoke, particulate matter and odors are common occurrences. The&#13;
Amrousiyeh incinerator would not, therefore, be expanded.&#13;
3.06 Mitigation Measures. The proposed alternative for the incinerator expansion is the&#13;
construction of a compost plant at the existing site and modernization of the existing ovens at&#13;
the incinerator, so as to meet European Union standards. Inefficient incineration of the wastes&#13;
will be resolved by selective collection of wastes with higher calorific value, by use of the high&#13;
calorific value sorted waste generated by the compost plant and\or by use of compost from the&#13;
composting plant. This solution is an integrated solution that encourages reduction, reuse and&#13;
recycling of waste materials and also makes efficient use of the existing facilities at the site.&#13;
The mitigation measures to be implemented for the composting plant will be similar to those&#13;
described above for the composting plants at Saida and Zahle.&#13;
3.07 General Site Selection Criteria for Landfills. The selection of sites for landfills in&#13;
Lebanon is a difficult process due to the lack of suitable sites in the rugged mountainous terrain,&#13;
due to the disruption of effective municipal land use planning procedures during the civil war&#13;
and due to opposition to landfill sites from those in their vicinity. The "not in my backyard"&#13;
attitude to accepting landfills appears to be widespread among landowners and the public in&#13;
Lebanon. A general set of criteria have been developed to: a) assist in the selection of rational&#13;
sites for landfills and b) define basic design principles for landfills. The criteria emphasize&#13;
avoidance of sensitive environmental features, while taking into account the need for landfills&#13;
located close to all population centers to minimize transport distances, and are summarized in&#13;
Attachment 8.  An environmental assessment (EA) report recommending one or several&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 10 of 10&#13;
environmentally acceptable sites will be prepared for each caza by CDR, and the EA report will&#13;
be reviewed by the Bank. The EAs will systematically analyze three main environmental&#13;
aspects: (i) justification of site selection; (ii) results of the public consultation process; (iii) site&#13;
specific design criteria for environmental mitigation and protection.&#13;
3.08  Hospital Wastes. Inventories of hospital waste were carried out for the cazas of Saida&#13;
and Zahle, and for western Beirut. These surveys are a first attempt to describe the types and&#13;
quantities of hospital wastes generated in Lebanon. The survey results indicated that hospital&#13;
wastes represent a minor proportion of the overall waste production: less than 1 % of daily waste&#13;
generation. The hospitals wastes consist of mainly domestic wastes (from the kitchens, offices,&#13;
general maintenance services) but infectious wastes (consisting of human tissue, blood and&#13;
laboratory wastes) can represent up to 50%, as is common in western Europe. Presently both&#13;
these types of hospital wastes are co-mingled in collection and disposal with the other municipal&#13;
wastes. The only exception occurs at two hospitals in western Beirut which are equipped with&#13;
special incinerators. Under the project, a feasibility study and environmental assessment for the&#13;
location and sizing of a central hospital wastes incinerator will be carried out and funding&#13;
provided for the incinerator and the necessary collection vehicles.&#13;
3.09  Industrial Wastes. Inventories of industrial waste were carried out for the cazas of&#13;
Saida and Zahle, and for western Beirut. The inventories were compiled based on systematic&#13;
interviews with owners and managers of local industries. Industries surveyed include slaughter&#13;
houses, rendering plants, chicken and livestock production, tanneries, dye and textile mills, food&#13;
transformation industries, vehicle repair garages and furniture plants. These surveys are a first&#13;
attempt to describe the types and quantities of industrial wastes generated in Lebanon, and the&#13;
results presented in the EAs show that: i) the quantities are probably underestimated; ii) existing&#13;
disposal practices are basically haphazard, for example disposal in rivers, on roadside in&#13;
uncontrolled dumps, mixture with all other plant wastes or burning of used tires. Further work&#13;
will be undertaken to develop a plan, to be financed by the ERRP, so as to separately collect&#13;
and to separately dispose of the various categories of industrial wastes.&#13;
3.10  Coastal Zone Management Plan. The first step in the preparation of the coastal zone&#13;
management (CZM) plan will be a full assessment of the key coastal resources under threat by&#13;
development pressures. A regional environmental assessment (REA) will provide a diagnostic&#13;
of the present situation, and forecast the state of the coastal zone and its resources by the year&#13;
2010 under various investment scenarios. It will identify the main sources of environmental&#13;
degradation, critical areas and emergency actions, in a study corridor 16 km wide. This REA&#13;
will be used for the preparation of land-use policies which can lead to environmentally&#13;
sustainable patterns. The consultant will commence work early in 1995.&#13;

SOLID WASTE/ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
ODOR MONITORING APPROACH FOR MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE&#13;
COMPOST PLANTS&#13;
A. Background to Odor Regulations and Standards&#13;
1.    The goal of setting uniform legal regulations and standards for odors is to define a level&#13;
of odor that causes intolerable annoyance to the general population, to identify the source of the&#13;
annoying odor and to take action to reduce the odor to an acceptable or unobjectionable level.&#13;
As many odors are difficult to detect using modem analytical chemical techniques, the human&#13;
nose still remains the most sensitive practical measuring instrument for odors.&#13;
2.    A simple description of modem odor measurement involves: (i) collection of odorous air&#13;
in tedlar or tevlar plastic bags; (ii) metering precise diluted amounts of the collected odorous air&#13;
through an olfactometer to human noses belonging to a group of people with nornal sensitivities&#13;
to odors (referred to as an odor panel); and (iii) determining the odor level after dilution of&#13;
samples at which 50 percent of the panel can correctly detect the odorous sample so as to obtain&#13;
an objective quantitative measure (referred to as a dilution factor). The ideal goal for a compost&#13;
facility would be to have an undetectable odor level at the property line as measured by the odor&#13;
panel or alternatively a buffer zone specifying minimum distances to the nearest occupied&#13;
residences.&#13;
3.    As this method of measuring odors requires: (i) a high degree of quality control (for&#13;
example less than 4 hours storage of odorous samples, availability of 5-7 qualified odor panelists&#13;
on the day of odor testing, high purity non-odorous bottled air, odor free room, precise dilution&#13;
metering, trained personnel, etc.,); (ii) does not take into account varying meteorological&#13;
conditions; and (iii) is not directly related the degree of annoyance an odor will have in a&#13;
community due to wide individual tolerance levels, neither the United States EPA&#13;
(Environmental Protection Agency) nor the European Union have adopted uniform odor&#13;
standards. The approach to controlling odors varies in each state in the United States and in&#13;
each European country. Still the basis for regulatory involvement in all jurisdictions are&#13;
complaints by the general public.&#13;

B. Odor Monitoring Approach for World Bank Financed Compost Plants In Lebanon&#13;
4.    The purpose of the odor monitoring program is to establish if there is a recognizable odor&#13;
problem in the community, as complaints from a limited number of people, or numerous&#13;
complaints from the same people may not represent the feelings of the community as a whole.&#13;
As chronic complainers may be justified in their perception of odors as objectionable, the goal&#13;
is how:&#13;
(i)   to establish that there is genuine odor problem in the community; and&#13;
(ii)  to prove that spontaneous complainers are not just trouble makers.&#13;
5.    The steps in the odor monitoring approach are as follows:&#13;
(i)   all odor complaints reported to the compost plant or government officials, must&#13;
be imnmediately forwarded to the municipal engineer;&#13;
(ii)   The municipal engineer or a trained investigator should immediately contact the&#13;
complainant to ascertain the current situation, based on the following pertinent&#13;
information:&#13;
(a)   is the problem currently occurring;&#13;
(b)   a description of the odor which includes the nature, intensity and duration&#13;
(for intensity description see table 1);&#13;
(c)   the suspected source; and&#13;
(d)   any physical effects incurred by the complainant.&#13;
(iii)  if a complainant identifies a suspected source, the investigator should quickly visit&#13;
the source and record an arrival time;&#13;
(iv)  the investigator proceeds to conduct a 360 degree odor survey of the suspected&#13;
source (for example at a compost plant from the receiving pit, the fermentation&#13;
area. the maturation area, or the odor control unit); when an odor is detected the&#13;
investigator records the following information: (a) the characteristics of the odor&#13;
and weather conditions including wind speed and direction, (b) any physical&#13;
effects on the investigator should be noted, and (c) the intensity of the odor&#13;
should be evaluated (as per table 1); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Attachment 4 to ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
(v)   the manager of the compost plant is requested by the municipal engineer to&#13;
undertake corrective action to resolve the source of the odor.&#13;
6.    Table, 1 is an aid to used by the inspector in combination with the duration of an odor&#13;
to decide if there is interference with a complainant's enjoyment of life and property.&#13;
7.    The compost plant should be equipped with a simple meteorological station to provide&#13;
information, preferably on a continuous basis, on wind speeds and directions, daily temperatures&#13;
and precipitation. This data is essential to properly resolve any odor complaints.&#13;
8.   In addition the municipal engineer should form  an odor committee composed of&#13;
approximately 5 citizens from within the caza and in the area close to the compost plant, which&#13;
would be active when there are repeated complaints from the same people. Utider such&#13;
circumstances the municipal engineer would call upon the odor comnittee for assistance in&#13;
jointly investigating odor complaints, as described in item 5.&#13;
9.   If the above approach to odor monitoring is hot successful in identifying if a community&#13;
odor problem exists, then an international odor evaluation laboratory should be contracted to&#13;
define the odor situation, to locate its sources and to recommend measures to reduce odors to&#13;
an acceptable level. An odor evaluation of this scope is estimated to cost in the order of US$&#13;
100,000, which would be managed by the municipality on a cost reimbursable basis paid for by&#13;
the compost plant operator.&#13;

distinct and clearly distinguishable and&#13;
/or irritating.&#13;
4 - Strong                            Odorant present in the air which would&#13;
be objectionable and cause a person to&#13;
attempt to avoid it completely, could&#13;
indicate a tendency to possibly produce&#13;
physiological effects during prolonged&#13;
exposure.&#13;
5 - Very Strong                       Odorant present which is so strong it is&#13;
overpowering and intolerable for any&#13;
length of time and could tend to easily&#13;
produce some physiological effects.&#13;

SOLID WASTE/ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY STATEMENT&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Refuse collection and disposal in Lebanon has always been the responsibility of the&#13;
municipalities, which operate under the tutelage of the newly-created Ministry of Municipal and&#13;
Rural Affairs (MMRA). Law No. 118 of 1977, the Municipal Law, gives municipalities the&#13;
power to organize solid waste collection and disposal.  Various government institutions,&#13;
including the Ministries of Environment, Interior, Public Health and Social Affairs, have&#13;
responsibility for functions related to Solid Waste Management (SWM), such as environmental&#13;
protection, transport (traffic), public health and labor.&#13;
2.    Several problems have been affecting the provision of adequate SWM services. In&#13;
particular, solid waste collection services have been provided by financially weak municipal&#13;
institutions with a limited resource base, largely dependent on central government budgetary&#13;
transfers for their revenues. Also, Lebanon has few sites readily available for appropriate&#13;
disposal of solid waste, particularly sanitary landfills. The topography of the country, divided&#13;
between steep mountains, dense urban development and scarce agricultural soil, leaves very little&#13;
choice of land available for waste disposal within close reach of cities. It has been found easier&#13;
to dump the refuse at the nearest vacant stretch of the sea coast. The results are all too plain -&#13;
pollution of the beaches, environmental degradation and possible breakout of epidemics.&#13;
Government Action&#13;
3.    The Lebanese Government has embarked on a solid waste management program with the&#13;
following objectives: (i) providing SWM services to all the urban communities of Lebanon in&#13;
an environmentally sound manner; (ii) preventing further environmental degradation resulting&#13;
from uncontrolled dumping of wastes, and initiating a program to address the environmental&#13;
problems associated with existing dump sites; (iii) replacing damaged and antiquated collection&#13;
equipment and extending waste collection services to new communities; (iv) repairing and&#13;
rehabilitating existing disposal facilities; (v) establishing and operating suitable sanitary landfills&#13;
in all Cazas; (vi) utilizing the private sector in rendering waste collection and disposal services;&#13;
and (vii) ensuring sustainability of services through cost recovery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 11&#13;

Policy Statement&#13;
4.    It is the stated policy of the Government to improve solid waste collection and disposal&#13;
services in Lebanon and prevent further environmental degradation. To implement this policy,&#13;
it is the Government's intention to attain gradually full cost recovery for solid waste services.&#13;
Firstly, wherever the population mass warrants it, consideration will be given to the construction&#13;
of additional compost plants and/or sanitary landfills. The method of composting will be&#13;
modified in several ways: (i) compost plants will be provided with pre-sorting facilities for&#13;
potential recycling; (ii) the quality of compost will be improved and a powerful campaign will&#13;
be launched with the farmers to market the compost; and (iii) a special effort will be made to&#13;
create small industries based on the utilization of recycled materials. Where it is not possible&#13;
to find adequate land for sanitary landfills and composting does not prove to be a viable option,&#13;
consideration would be given to the construction of incinerators with upstream sorting of the&#13;
wastes. Secondly, to supplement municipal revenues, which have recently been increased&#13;
through a rise in rental values, a gradual system of cost recovery will be initiated. The fee will&#13;
initially cover about 25 % of the cost of service. Thirdly, based on the experience gained under&#13;
the ongoing projects in utilizing the private sector in SWM operations, the role of the private&#13;
sector will be expanded to cover comprehensive systems. Existing municipal workers would be&#13;
employed in such activities as street cleaning, development of parks, etc. Fourthly, a special&#13;
effort would be made to introduce an economy of scale into the sector through the grouping of&#13;
several municipalities (or even Cazas) into associations that would pool their resources together&#13;
in providing SWM services. Successful examples of these already exist in the country.&#13;
Long-Term Strategy&#13;
5.    In order to implement its policy, the Government has undertaken a study to help provide&#13;
it with the tools necessary to realize its long-term objectives.  The objectives of the study are&#13;
to carry out an overview of the SWM sector and submit recommendations for the achievement&#13;
of full cost recovery. Its findings and recommendations will help the Government take&#13;
appropriate decisions for the reorganization of the sector in the future. The study looks into all&#13;
aspects of the sector and, inter alia, covers the following topics:&#13;
-     the method of solid waste collection and the possibility of increasing efficiency;&#13;
-     the methods of disposal - landfill, composting, incineration - and the most suitable&#13;
method for each area or region;&#13;
-     the method of collection of municipal fees and the computerization of accounts;&#13;
-     the possibilities of improving the quality and marketability of compost, manual&#13;
pre-sorting of the waste, and establishment of industries based on recycled waste;&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Solid Waste/Environmental Management
            Project will comprise provision of: (i) refuse collection
            facilities - containers and compactor trucks; (ii) waste
            disposal facilities - sanitary landfills and compost plants;
            (iii) a hospital waste collection and disposal system; and
            (iv) technical assistance and preparation of a coastal zone
            management plan. It will meet the country's needs in
            solid waste management facilities, as foreseen in the
            National Emergency Reconstruction Plan. It will strengthen
            the institutions responsible for solid waste management
            (SWM) and encourage private sector participation, not only
            in the collection services but in the whole sector,
            including the investment of capital in SWM. It will also
            help develop a Coastal Zone Management (CZM) plan that will
            serve as a tool to protect the Lebanese coast from further degradation.
