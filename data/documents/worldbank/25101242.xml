&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the&#13;
World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh&#13;
Kapur, The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings&#13;
Institution Press, 1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic&#13;
overview of the work of the person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the&#13;
planned publication itself and the sources that should be consulted; at other times they&#13;
talked about persons and publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes&#13;
and transcripts begin and end abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group&#13;
Archives believes that this transcript may be of interest to researchers and makes it&#13;
available for public use.&#13;

[Begin Tape 1, Side A]1&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So you were an ED [Executive Director] for like two or three, several&#13;
years?&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: Several years, yes. I went there in November â&#128;&#152;82 and left in January â&#128;&#153;87.&#13;
Itâ&#128;&#153;s about a little more than four years.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You were Finance Minister?&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: I was Finance Secretary before I went. In fact, I succeeded not exactly&#13;
[M.] Syeduzzaman but Mr. [Abul] Khair, who was Syeduzzaman's successor as&#13;
Finance Secretary.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: I was Finance Secretary for a few years before I went there.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, you've had a lot of encounter with the Bank, then, and I think that&#13;
almost anything that you would like to tell us about your impressions, either from&#13;
your period as an ED, anything about the operations of the Bank, whether or not&#13;
concerning Bangladesh, would be interesting. But also we are making this trip in&#13;
Asia to get some sense of how the Bank looks from the point of view of recipient&#13;
countries, governments, so we're interested in what the main lines of effort have been&#13;
in Bangladesh and how the Bank has done, maybe better in some sectors than others,&#13;
maybe in some periods better than others, maybe it's changed its spots somehow&#13;
recently. Our general impression so far is that the years â&#128;&#153;79-â&#128;&#152;80 are a very important&#13;
turning point in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So whatever you would like to . . .&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: Thank you for all this. Before I talk about the Bank and my countryâ&#128;&#153;s and&#13;
my personal relationships with that institution I think it would be right for me to give&#13;
you a little bit of my background . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Please.&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: . . because in everybody's assessment of institutions and activities of this&#13;
nature, it's very importantly influenced by the kind of attitudes, perceptions that he&#13;
brings to it. I have been a government servant all my life--I mean, all my professional&#13;
life--and most of my work has been in the Ministry of Finance, which means that until&#13;
about 1980-81, when I became Finance Secretary, most of my interactions were with&#13;
the [International Monetary] Fund rather than the Bank. Internally also the Ministry&#13;
of Finance has a bias towards stability and equilibrium rather than growth. Of course,&#13;
you cannot put these things into such separate, water-tight compartments, but&#13;

                               November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
temperamentally, I have argued, before my interactions with the Bank started, my bias&#13;
was towards the maintenance of stability and equilibrium in the economy, which&#13;
means that there was a great deal of conservatism in my attitude towards economic&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
And around the time when I began to have more direct interactions with the Bank as&#13;
distinct from the Fund--but, of course, you could not interact with the Fund without&#13;
some interactions with the Bank. Already in the late â&#128;&#152;70s that is how the programs&#13;
were shaping up. So around the time when I started interacting with the Bank, the&#13;
Bank itself underwent an important change, I would say, in its attitude towards and its&#13;
relationships with many of the member countries. I'm referring to the emergence of&#13;
the structural adjustment lending concept in the late â&#128;&#152;70s, early â&#128;&#152;80s.&#13;
&#13;
Now, around that time I noticed that within Bangladesh, as perhaps in many other&#13;
developing countries, there were a great many reservations emerging about the&#13;
difficulties associated with policy-based lending generally, and that has been a&#13;
traditional concern of most developing countries in their relationships with the Bank&#13;
and the Fund. Now this--to begin with I found this somewhat disturbing because I&#13;
could see that if the borrowing countries begin to look upon borrowing relations with&#13;
the Bank mainly as a necessity rather than a positive phenomenon, there is a great&#13;
deal of danger of the relationships souring over a period of time because it is likely&#13;
that countries would repeatedly undertake programs, make commitments, which&#13;
might not carry full inner conviction, and subsequently there might be definite&#13;
disturbances to most people's relationships.&#13;
&#13;
Soon after that, when I went to the Bank, I found that this apprehension was partly&#13;
coming true. But, of course, at that time--I went there in 1982--the world economic&#13;
scene was then dominated by the debt problem, and the debt problem at that time was&#13;
not directly associated with our part of the world. South Asia was not directly&#13;
involved in this. So there was, for a period, a certain degree of quiescence, I would&#13;
say, in South Asians' relationship with the Bank because they were not, as borrowers,&#13;
they were not taking center-stage positions. The other debt-ridden countries were&#13;
coming to the forefront. But even then at the Board [of Executive Directors] I noticed&#13;
that when the various policy-based lending programs have come in and developing&#13;
countries in general tended to react as a group with a great deal of sympathy to each&#13;
other, but the rhetoric of the discussion on our part was more--it was partly political&#13;
and partly economic, I would say, because issues of national sovereignty were very&#13;
often associated with this economic debate, which I thought was a bit of&#13;
oversimplification. But, anyway, that reflected a certain sentiment.&#13;
&#13;
As the emphasis on macroeconomic policy adjustments--and adjustment was the main&#13;
aspect of policy-based lending, general macroeconomic adjustment, restoration of&#13;
equilibrium as something essential before growth could be resumed or before&#13;
meaningful economic planning and economic assistance could be undertaken--this&#13;
was the main issue that emerged repeatedly in many of the lending programs.&#13;
&#13;
The one thing that struck me as really meaningful and significant in the reservations&#13;
of many of the borrowing countries about the rigors of policy-based lending was that&#13;
very often the pace of adjustment demanded tended to be faster than the economies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               Ghulam Kibria&#13;
                         November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
could absorb. This is one thing on which I personally felt that the Bank needed to&#13;
develop some sensitivity to the concerns of the borrowing countries.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the other aspect of the policy-based adjustment lending programs that needed, I&#13;
think, to receive more particular attention from the Bank as an institution was that the&#13;
adjustment programs--the central adjustment program, if I may call it that, that the&#13;
Bank reflected in each individual program--they would require for their success, for&#13;
their effectiveness, a series of adjustments in the various other institutions and&#13;
individuals right down to the grassroots level within the economies. Now, naturally,&#13;
the ability of the various economic agents in the countries, the individual countries, to&#13;
cope with the implications of the central adjustment at the national level that these&#13;
programs incorporated varies from country to country, and these variations--these are&#13;
my personal opinions and observations, and some of it may sound abstract; please feel&#13;
free to ask me to clarify my thoughts if you think I'm not clear--but the ability of the&#13;
individual economic agents to respond to the demands of the central aggregative&#13;
adjustments incorporated into most of the programs that the Bank undertakes with the&#13;
individual member countries varies from country to country, largely because the&#13;
initial state of the economic agents (I mean, the poverty level at which they are or the&#13;
past experience of adjustment, upheavals in the economy and in their personal lives)&#13;
also varies from country to country. Some countries have not felt the impact of&#13;
adjustment and change for a long time. Some countries have felt it more. There is&#13;
one thing. Some countries are living nearer the subsistence level, and some are living&#13;
above that.&#13;
&#13;
So now these variations, itâ&#128;&#153;s very difficult for the Bank missions to capture these&#13;
variations from country to country, and that I believe caused many of the difficulties&#13;
or perceived difficulties in the member countries. That also partly explains the&#13;
inability of many borrowing countries to sustain hard adjustment programs. They are&#13;
difficult: the pace was too hard or because enough thought was not given to the ability&#13;
of the individual economic agents within the country under consideration to undertake&#13;
their own adjustment programs in response to the big adjustment program at the&#13;
macro level incorporated into the difficult program.&#13;
&#13;
This is what many of the borrowing countries mean when they say very crudely and&#13;
simply that the Bank and the Fund have one universal program or approach to&#13;
economic adjustment and they go on replicating it from [inaudible] they talk about.&#13;
Now, when the borrowing countries say this, of course itâ&#128;&#153;s true, that this is said by&#13;
government leaders, civil servants, and others who have the unpleasant task of getting&#13;
out the adjustments, of getting the unpleasant and hard messages to their compatriots&#13;
and seeing that these are implemented, and they may tend to exaggerate it a little&#13;
because everyone wants a line of least resistance. It's natural; it's human. But there is&#13;
an element of truth if you take into consideration the fact that it is not the basic nature&#13;
of the adjustments that will vary from country to country, but usually the imbalances&#13;
that you are trying to correct are either fiscal or theyâ&#128;&#153;re balance of payments. There&#13;
are two or three basic areas where--and everywhere you begin with a slightly&#13;
restrictive approach, and then you, after you have restored a reasonable measure of&#13;
equilibrium, and then you go on to arrange for further stable growth.&#13;
&#13;
But that is not the point at issue, but what they really mean when they say this, when&#13;
they are accusing the Bank and the Fund of having one uniform approach to all, is that&#13;
&#13;
                                 Ghulam Kibria&#13;
                           November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
what they're really saying, I think, is that the pace is too fast, that the pace is almost&#13;
universally the same from country to country, and also that enough attention is not&#13;
given to the variations between--the micro variations between the economic agents&#13;
within, as you go from country to country.&#13;
&#13;
But this is natural, I think, looking at it from the point of view of the Bank&#13;
professionals, because they work on an annual program basis. They have an annual&#13;
lending program, and each country section or country division has got its own&#13;
program to keep up, and even, I mean, a fixed time it has to finish the job. So there is&#13;
a limit to the amount of refinement that they can undertake and they have to finish the&#13;
program within the year.&#13;
&#13;
It's not an academic institution, primarily; it is a . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Do you feel that the Bank has become too much like the Fund?&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: Not exactly. I personally had always felt that the Bank should have been a&#13;
little more like the Fund as well to begin with, but there was a long period of time&#13;
when it was very different from the Fund and so it had to correct the balance at a time&#13;
of crisis, and it started being a little more like the Fund. And partly because the&#13;
rhetoric and the general superficial elements of Bank culture had been for a long time&#13;
somewhat different from that of the Fund, that people started saying that the Bank&#13;
was becoming like the Fund and that there was hardly any difference between the&#13;
two. But I personally didn't think that it was a bad thing if it became more like the&#13;
Fund, but I did feel that both the Fund and the Bank had to take into consideration in&#13;
some greater detail the differences between countries in respect of the pace of change&#13;
that they can absorb in a healthy way or else there is a risk of program breakdowns.&#13;
&#13;
And that is what we had. We had too many breakdowns in the programs both in the&#13;
Fund and in the Bank--not because, I think, not because there was any essential defect&#13;
in the basic assumptions of the program or the basic goals of the programs, but&#13;
because the speed of adjustment came on too fast in many cases--not in allâ&#128;&#148;and also&#13;
because the ability of the individual economic agents and institutions within the&#13;
country to absorb some of these changes was very limited to begin with, but given&#13;
some time and a more generous pace of adjustment, probably it would have been&#13;
easier for them to develop their absorbative capacity. Because an adjustment is also a&#13;
shock, really, every adjustment is a major shock. Now, the ability of the economies&#13;
and societies to absorb shock varies somewhat, partly depending on the level at which&#13;
they are operating.&#13;
&#13;
Also, I think, in the immediately preceding years the emphasis on the volume of&#13;
lending in the Bank had been very strong, and that did perhaps result in the adoption&#13;
of many projects for which the market was not perhaps fully--the output of those&#13;
projects was a little, on purely economic pricing, the output of the projects was&#13;
perhaps a little too costly for the consumers. In other words, the market was not yet&#13;
mature, was not yet fully developed.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: What kinds of projects were you thinking of?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Ghulam Kibria&#13;
                            November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: I am thinking of most of the projects other than infrastructure. For&#13;
example, electricity projects, power projects, and so on. And if you--because, you&#13;
see, all the sectors do not progress at the same pace, at an ideal pace, in harmony with&#13;
each other, so you have to allow for a little bit of gaps between them. For example, if&#13;
agricultureâ&#128;&#148;Iâ&#128;&#153;m putting it very crudely--if agriculture in a predominantly agricultural&#13;
country to begin with, if agriculture has not developed well and yet you have gone in&#13;
for rural electrification, a power project on a large scale, and then you did not&#13;
introduce rational pricing to begin with and then suddenly you find the need for&#13;
adjustment. You have allowed electricity to remain under-priced, and then suddenly&#13;
you have to adjust. And yet those who will buy this electricity haven't had their real&#13;
income increased at a reasonable pace so that now there is a big gap between the&#13;
consumer's ability to pay for it and the price that economic pricing demands. Now,&#13;
this is not a state of affairs with which any economy can live for very long. You have&#13;
to adjust, but the crucial decision here is the pace of adjustment.&#13;
&#13;
But I realize, of course, that the Bank as an institution is not operating as a completely&#13;
free agent either. It has to move in step with the, you know, with the perceptions&#13;
worldwide, particularly in the creditor countries, the countries that supply the capital&#13;
on [inaudible] the wherewithal with which the Bank moves.&#13;
&#13;
Another thing that I would like to talk to you about is the Bank as an institution, not&#13;
its lending policy but the Bank as an institution and as a collection of people who&#13;
work there. My most pleasant and most instructive experience after I went to the&#13;
Bank was my discovery--which was a very personal--I did not expect the professional&#13;
staff of the Bank or, for that matter, any institution, to be as truly international as I&#13;
found them. I had an opportunity of mixing very intimately with people in the day-to-&#13;
day work environment, and it would be very rare, I think, for anybody to find a single&#13;
Bank professional who is influenced by his own national background when dealing&#13;
with projects or dealing with ideas. Of this I'm sure.&#13;
&#13;
Now, in many of the developing countries in general loose day-to-day conversation&#13;
you would find a tendency among mid-level bureaucrats and others to equate the&#13;
Bank with national institutions in the industrial countries, to put it on the same footing&#13;
as purely national institutions because it happens to be located in Washington and&#13;
because it happens to have a large--because so many of the professionals happen to&#13;
come from industrial countries and so on. Now, this I was convinced--when I lived&#13;
there and worked with them--that this is not true. This has never--I don't know&#13;
whether in the past this was true, but now certainly they are professionals, very&#13;
strongly imbued with the spirit of international development, and there is no influence&#13;
on their professional work of their national backgrounds. This was a pleasant&#13;
discovery, and I think this is the major asset of the Bank, as well as the Fund, as&#13;
institutions. And this, in all internal policies in the Bank and the Fund, I believe, do&#13;
pay and should continue to pay a great deal of attention to fostering and sustaining&#13;
this spirit of internationalism. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a very important asset for the work.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I'm glad to hear that testimony because I have the same impression, but it's&#13;
very good to get it volunteered by a person like yourself.&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: I would like you to take along with you my valedictory statement on the&#13;
subject when I was [all speaking at once] small statement.&#13;
&#13;
                                Ghulam Kibria&#13;
                          November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Ah, wonderful, yes.&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: It is couched in somewhat sentimental terms because it was a valedictory&#13;
statement, but â&#128;&#156;sentimentalâ&#128;&#157; is not necessarily untrue. I have had a copy made, and I&#13;
thought I would like to give it to you because it is, you know [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
The period of my stay, my work on the Bank Board, was a very interesting period&#13;
because the capital markets, financial markets, were extremely volatile at that time,&#13;
and there was a great deal of innovation going on all around. And the Bank was one&#13;
major innovator in the capital markets at that time, and I distinctly remember that we&#13;
had Eugene Rotberg on the Board at that time, vice president of finance, and he was a&#13;
very innovative, inventive, lively person with a very strong, lively perception of the&#13;
nuances of the financial markets, I think. I'm not an expert, but I learned a lot from&#13;
him and his people who were in that department who were at that time doing a great&#13;
deal ofâ&#128;&#148;they were adapting and readapting themselves to the changes in the financial&#13;
markets at that time, very creatively I thought, particularly in defining the swap&#13;
techniques that eventually were adopted. It was veryâ&#128;&#148;it was technical, but I was&#13;
fascinated by the speed with which they reacted and the way in which they took&#13;
advantage of the market. It was ultimately for the benefit of the borrowers.&#13;
&#13;
This financial management was the more active aspect of the Bank's work at that&#13;
time. In terms of lending policy, there were periods, recurrent periods--I would not&#13;
say years--but quarters, fractions of years, of stagnation because policy-based lending&#13;
was always contentious and it takes time to complete and so some of the programs&#13;
took longer than one would expect. But they always came round to it and resumed&#13;
the speed, and I think on the whole on the lending side the performance of the Bank at&#13;
that time tended to falter at times, not because only of the Bank's fault but because of&#13;
many difficulties within the borrowing countries, some of which were political and&#13;
some economic, some had to do with management, and sometimes even natural&#13;
disasters played a part.&#13;
&#13;
Towards the end of my stay there in about â&#128;&#153;85-â&#128;&#152;86, roughly coinciding with Mr.&#13;
[Barber B.] Conable's coming to the Bank, then we had the policy framework papers&#13;
jointly worked out between the Bank and the Fund, and that was again a new&#13;
beginning in policy-based lending with good cooperation between the Fund and the&#13;
Bank. I think in all policy-based lending, cooperation between the Bank and the Fund&#13;
is essential because many of these policy-based programs, adjustment programs,&#13;
require very substantial balance of payments support which the Bank by itself cannot&#13;
and should not attempt to provide always, so you need the Bank and the Fund&#13;
working together in such programs.&#13;
&#13;
When the ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility] programs of the Fund&#13;
were coming up, across the south and the ESAF programs, Bangladesh of course&#13;
entered into these programs quite early on and had difficulty in following them up all&#13;
the way through, partly because of natural disasters that intervened but also because&#13;
the exact implications of the programs were not always very clear, I believe, to the&#13;
officials who would have to implement them. We perhaps assumed a little too readily&#13;
that we couldn't live with the pace that was demanded of us. Sometimes the&#13;
adjustments took somewhat longer than we thought when we undertook the programs,&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                           8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
but I must say that both the Bank and the Fund were understanding of this and&#13;
through an iterative process of adjustment or adjustment programs on the whole we&#13;
have not done too badly, I think, though there is always scope for improvement.&#13;
&#13;
I think now probably many of the borrowing countries have had some experience in&#13;
dealing with these adjustment programs, both in their negotiations and subsequently&#13;
in their implementation of these programs. Both the borrowing countries and the&#13;
lending institutions, the Bank and the Fund, would perhaps be a little bit more&#13;
realistic. Sometimes we attempted too fast a pace of adjustment.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: In terms of the Bank and Fund, they moved--I think you've been saying,&#13;
and I would think--toward a greater degree of overlap, in fact, from the late â&#128;&#152;70s up&#13;
until now. Do you think on balance that was unavoidable, or it was a good thing, and&#13;
in the future do you see this overlap continuing? Would you even go so far as to&#13;
make eventually some kind of merger, or would you see the two roles being&#13;
differentiated again?&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: I think that the institutions should and will continue to be separate&#13;
institutions for a long time, but a great deal of close cooperation is very desirable, I&#13;
thinkâ&#128;&#148;some overlap, even, and I will explain why I think so.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Please.&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: A, because the balance of payments support that is needed for adjustment&#13;
programs cannot come from any one of these two institutions acting by itself.&#13;
Particularly the Fund's association is very important from that point of view.&#13;
Secondly, the Bank has a skill mix in its professionals which the Fund does not have,&#13;
and most of the adjustment programs require for their success a series of central&#13;
adjustment programs to work in tandem with the general macro economic adjustment&#13;
program, the kind of program that you find in ESAF. If you look at any of the ESAF&#13;
program matrices, you will find that there are so many other sectoral issues embedded&#13;
in them that they can be successfully implemented only if there are several sectoral&#13;
programs also going side by side with the central structural adjustment program.&#13;
Now, these things cannot be worked out consistently unless both the Bank and the&#13;
Fund move simultaneously into a country and stay with them and work with them&#13;
[inaudible] in a sustained manner.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: You said that in looking at the adjustment programs [inaudible] that there&#13;
was not much variation, so hence one sees that they often led to or asked for too&#13;
rapid a pace of change and also did not take into account the variations between how&#13;
micro-level economic institutions react to macro change. Howâ&#128;&#148;what would you&#13;
speculate was the reason why the Bank did not take this into account?&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: I think because they were racing against time also. These are institutions&#13;
that work on a yearly lending program basis. Like any other national government,&#13;
they have funds which will lapse at the end of the year, and unless they carry through&#13;
certain programs, unless they enter into these programs, they have a country program&#13;
expressed in very precise, quantitative terms, and the general, the natural tendency of&#13;
every vice president would be to see that his program is utilized because when they&#13;
are going to budget for the next year, he would otherwise be losing money and his&#13;
&#13;
                                 Ghulam Kibria&#13;
                           November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
performance would be considered to be below par. So there is a tendency to enter&#13;
into the program, to work out the program as fast as possible.&#13;
&#13;
But if you want to engage in that kind of research, you have to do a lot of missionary&#13;
work. First of all, you have to engage in very extensive exchanges with the&#13;
machineries of government in the borrowing countries at the mid-level, at the junior&#13;
level. You have to spend a lot, invest a lot of time and understanding in these minor,&#13;
micro-level area issues. For example, it would not be possible for a Bank mission&#13;
really to go into the family budget of an urban, middle-class family. If you really&#13;
study those things, youâ&#128;&#153;ll get insights about the permissible pace and the sequence of&#13;
steps that you cannot get only by looking at macro-level statistics.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Has the resident office here helped on that sort of thing? The local office?&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: The local office does a great deal of helpful work but not this kind of&#13;
original research, generally not--not to my knowledge. It is--they are generally&#13;
engaged in supervision work of the existing, on-going projects and in follow-up&#13;
discussions with the officials of the various ministries. After the missions have left,&#13;
then they do the follow-up work. That is how they are structured. Now in order to--if&#13;
you want to gain insights, detailed insights into the working of the economic agents&#13;
and if you want to visualize how a particular adjustment program is going to impact&#13;
on the economic agents, you have to spend some time and the project will take longer&#13;
to prepare and then it will have [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
And then again there is the problem of fitting it into the overall perceptions at the&#13;
Bank Board and also particularly among the major creditor countries. See, this yearâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
a period when the adjustment programs came on the scene at the time when the major&#13;
creditor countries were themselves having acute budgetary problems, and public&#13;
perceptions in those countries were also less favorable to aid and assistance than in&#13;
the past, and so the people representing those countries on the Board naturally had to,&#13;
they pass, convey these perceptions, not so very consciously, but it was in the nature&#13;
of things that they would influence the Bank very significantly towards a rough and&#13;
quick completion of adjustment programs, undertaking of adjustment programs, and&#13;
spending so much time on these individual variations and refinements. I don't know if&#13;
I am expressing myself well enough.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, thatâ&#128;&#153;s fine.&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: Now, this was a period, thus, which did not allow for such refinements in&#13;
the designing of adjustment programs partly because of the nature of the institutions&#13;
themselves, the way they work, their annual budgets, by their deadlines and so on, and&#13;
also partly because the major creditor countries, the industrial countries, perhaps at&#13;
that time would be more inclined to have adjustment programs quickly prepared and&#13;
progress made on them rather than spending too much time on individual variations&#13;
and refinements. This is a guess. I mean, I cannot prove it, of course, but one can&#13;
see--and I also see that it is natural--I'm not saying that this was--it is natural that it&#13;
should be that way. But I think that when we look back and analyze these things, we&#13;
could draw conclusions from them which might enrich the designs of future&#13;
programs, given a little more patience and more understanding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                Ghulam Kibria&#13;
                          November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Also, I think if you look at many of the programs that were undertaken at that time,&#13;
you would see that during negotiations on questions of detail, the borrowing countries&#13;
did point out in their own crude ways many of the obstacles and difficulties that they&#13;
were going to have. And some of the difficulties were exaggerated statements of their&#13;
unwillingness to take hard adjustment programs. That's true. But there were also&#13;
many genuine difficulties which were pointed out, which are pointed out regularly by&#13;
borrowing countries, but generally no detailed records are kept of these objections, of&#13;
these difficulties expressed. It is not the practice to keep a detailed record of what&#13;
was not eventually agreed upon, so the intermediate stages are forgotten. It is only&#13;
the final agreement that is reflected in the document. I thought it would be a good&#13;
idea for the Bank to keep records of problems pointed out by the borrowers but&#13;
subsequently, let us say, set aside by agreement on both sides. But then when you&#13;
subsequently review the implementation and success of the project, it would be useful&#13;
to bring back some of the points that the borrowers brought up earlier, when they&#13;
were negotiating.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Let me ask you. I think this sort of follows up on that, specifically to&#13;
Bangladesh. In the function or the nature of policy conditioning, it's often argued that&#13;
one function is to strengthen the hands of some factions within the government, that&#13;
the governments are not monoliths and that, whether it's a ministry or finance or&#13;
whatever, that the imposition of conditions very often helps one set of players in a&#13;
government carry its argument against others. I know thatâ&#128;&#153;s very much the case--has&#13;
been--in India, but I don't really know about Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: It is true.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Is it true?&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: That would be especially true of the Ministry of Finance and other central,&#13;
you know, economic management agencies. As I said earlier, because of my work in&#13;
the Ministry of Finance I was biased more in favor of the Fund. Now when I said&#13;
that, I really meant in lending.&#13;
&#13;
I had this experience when I was a mid-level official in Pakistan. That was not&#13;
exactly Bangladesh, but it was in Pakistan. I was in the central Ministry of Finance,&#13;
and Pakistan entered into a couple of programs which were financed at that time.&#13;
Now, I distinctly remember that several of the conditionalities of the Fund programs&#13;
at the time were exactly the kind of things that we had been arguing with other&#13;
ministries and could not always get a conviction with them. But when the Fund&#13;
program involved these things, we were happy.&#13;
&#13;
And similar situations arise in Bangladesh, also, [inaudible] so in India and in most&#13;
countries. Usually the ministry of finance would be, I think, in favor of many of these&#13;
adjustments [inaudible] , but adjustment program steps, measures of this type are&#13;
always painful. Everybody resists them. That also is legitimate, but it only takes one&#13;
transfer of a minister from one ministry to another for his attitude to change also. But&#13;
his attitude in this matter changes with the responsibility [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                     11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The famous slogan in the U.S. government is that some assistant secretary&#13;
of HEW [Department of Health, Education and Welfare] said, â&#128;&#156;Where you stand&#13;
depends on where you sit.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: Exactly!&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What's your overall sense of how the adjustment programs have worked&#13;
here? Do you think that it's been a pretty good experience or . . .&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: I think it has been very good in its effect on the country.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: For the country.&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: For the country. One concrete result is the change in the composition of&#13;
exports. This is directly the result of adjustment programs undertaken. The&#13;
emergence of nontraditional exports is directly traceable, in my view, to (A) the&#13;
exchange rate policies undertaken around â&#128;&#152;82, â&#128;&#152;83, more or less consistent with a&#13;
realistic exchange rate policy, and the many micro measures undertaken to promote&#13;
exports. These two things acting together have made a significant change in the&#13;
composition of exports, export volume, growth, and now should be much larger. But&#13;
the change in the composition has been significant in the development and the&#13;
emergence of garment exports and a great many other small labor-intensive&#13;
manufactures are coming up, and there is a change in the composition of exports.&#13;
That has been good, but there are many other things that could have been done better&#13;
if, in my view, we had not attempted too much too soon, if we had set the pace at a&#13;
more realistic level.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: As youâ&#128;&#153;ve been just [inaudible] the conversation, there could be&#13;
improvements in the manner in which the Bank relates with negotiating just forâ&#128;&#148;you&#13;
mentioned the pace . .&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: It is the pace and also attention to some more details.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah. A little more helpful, a little more attentive to the political aspects, is&#13;
that a big part of this?&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: I personally would not say that because if you--under â&#128;&#156;political aspectsâ&#128;&#157; is&#13;
too vague and it is somewhat dangerous because you can cover almost anything under&#13;
politics. But I would say the ability of the economic agents, particularly, you know,&#13;
the people in the middle and lower-income levels, their ability to absorb the shocks&#13;
and stresses that every adjustment program entails, this has to be kept in mind, it&#13;
should be kept in mind. They do try to keep it in mind, but I think we could do a little&#13;
more of that.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: A little fine-tuning in the design?&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: Fine-tuning in the design of the program.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: One thing that, one general impression that one gets from looking at the&#13;
history of adjustments, both from the Bank, is that there are really two things going&#13;
on. One is more a matter of form, the other is policy . .&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Being Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: . . and also a matter of the severity of some of the adjustments. Now, what&#13;
happens in practice is that these agreements are negotiated and agreed and entered&#13;
into and they are complied with partially, and then new agreements are made, and&#13;
then a new one. It's a bit like maybe many commercial banks, who work with a&#13;
company. They give you a one-month letter loan, knowing that you can't pay but&#13;
you'll come back and renegotiate it. But some people look and see a lot of&#13;
noncompliance, bad behavior, and on paper it looks sometimes much worse than it is&#13;
in fact. Would that be a characterization of the way things have worked here?&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: Yes, I agree, except that I would say that I personally feel that it would be&#13;
better for the morale of the borrowing countries as well as the lenders, the lending&#13;
institutions, if at the outset we try to design a program which will have fewer&#13;
breakdowns. Itâ&#128;&#153;s like having a code of morality that you can live with, I mean, not to&#13;
be too ambitious at the beginning and then to suffer from a sense of sin. And a&#13;
chronic sense of sin creeps into the psychology of the bureaucracy and the&#13;
government and the cabinet, and sometimes they also say that, â&#128;&#156;Well, we have seen&#13;
all that. I mean, let's quickly get on with this and see what we can do afterwards.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
That is a dangerous state of mind, I think in economic [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You would have to be a good Roman Catholic, perhaps, to live with this--&#13;
where you make your confession, and you're all clean again!&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: Exactly! Yes, but there is this to be said for Roman Catholicism, that they&#13;
are working on a much larger time frame. [Laughter] But it is true, you cannot . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You don't know quite how much of a time frame you have!&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It could be short.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: There is a value to being clean in kind of mature and honest relationship,&#13;
whereas thisâ&#128;&#148;at least the way it's being done doesn't let you do that.&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: In many instances, but of course this program--I was talking in terms of&#13;
generalities, but there are again amongst these programs--there are some parts of&#13;
programs which were very realistic in their pace. I would like to emphasize again that&#13;
I think that having these programs--though in part unrealistically designed at times, as&#13;
I look at them--having these programs is better than not having them at all.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Let me press you on that because there is a question of modalities. There's&#13;
often said to be two different ways to go. One is the Fund and SAL [structural&#13;
adjustment loan] way, which is essentially preconditioning, where you have the&#13;
lender who lays down a set of requirements and you sign on and you get vetted for&#13;
these and if you pass the course you get another one. The other is said to be softer,&#13;
&#13;

                          November 20, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the dialoguing kind of approach, where you would have an ongoing conversation,&#13;
really, between the two parties about the same policy issues. And there presumably is&#13;
a kind of mutual learning going on, and you're trying to strengthen the hand of the&#13;
good guysâ&#128;&#148;I, as a donor, strengthen your hand. And you then, knowing that you can&#13;
win the support of the Bank or the Fund--the Fund wouldn't do this kind of thing--sell&#13;
your colleagues in the cabinet on a change of policy. You make the decisions. You&#13;
design the program. In fact, we talk about it, but it's your program. You design it.&#13;
The fine-tuning, the detail is yours, and you adopt it. It may be premised on a certain&#13;
input of resources, but I then as the donor only come along and give you a kind of&#13;
congratulatory loan once you've made the decision. Now, could you foresee that kind&#13;
of thing working here?&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: Not in the immediate future. Let me explain why. Because these are&#13;
countries--Bangladesh is one of the countries--which for long has associated&#13;
development with very active government intervention in everything. Now, we are--&#13;
with the rest of the world, we are breaking out into a different [inaudible] altogether,&#13;
taking a different view of the economy, and the Bank and the Fund have been taking&#13;
that view for a somewhat longer period in these countries. Now, we are stillâ&#128;&#148;we are&#13;
a very mixed bag of people, and the economic managers, the civil servants and others,&#13;
they vary very widely in their perception of how an economy works. So at this time&#13;
continuous interaction with the Bank and the Fund professionals--who, after all, are&#13;
our large-scale consultants, so to say, I mean in very general terms--continuous&#13;
interaction with them is useful in giving the managers in these countries important&#13;
insights into the designing of programs of this [inaudible] . So that if you--in many of&#13;
the countries, even in India, I would say, even in India because India has a larger&#13;
group of professionals both within the civil service and outside--but even there, see,&#13;
the prevailing philosophy for too long has been interventionist. So we can produce&#13;
programs of that type better than programs based upon a rapidly liberalizing&#13;
economy, and this is an important period of transition, and association and interaction&#13;
with Bank and Fund professionals is very important.&#13;
&#13;
It is the same situation as in the Soviet Union only that it is more extreme there&#13;
because they have had a hundred percent centrally-planned economy. We have had a&#13;
mixed economy where the role of the state, of central directives, of target-settingâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
this is the kind of thing we have been better at, you see. But in terms of designing a&#13;
program based on free market operations, the experience is still limited. One has to&#13;
work for some time on it. This is my own observation.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: A smaller version of whatâ&#128;&#153;s happening in Eastern Europe.&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: A smaller version, exactly.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I'm very embarrassed and disappointed because we are constrained by&#13;
another appointment, and there are a hundred things that we would like to . . .&#13;
&#13;
KIBRIA: Where do you have to go now?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The other appointment was starting about three minutes ago! I just thought&#13;
maybe you could have a secretary call this gentleman--you know him, no doubt, Mr.&#13;
Kazi Rahman.&#13;
