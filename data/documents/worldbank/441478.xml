        <abstracts>
            Power sector reforms in Chile and
            Argentina are now roughly fourteen and four years old. In
            both countries, restructuring and deregulation have
            increased efficiency, led to active entry by new generators,
            improved the quality of supply, and reduced prices in real
            terms. The authors' review of experience in both
            systems confirms that policymakers must apply effective
            measures to introduce and preserve competition. In Chile, a
            major concern is the predominance of one generator in one of
            the two systems.
