&amp;#12;&#13;
I INTRODUCTION&#13;
- The GoB agreed to relax its technicol stan-&#13;
dard which, as currently written, would legally&#13;
preclude the use of the condominial approach.&#13;
- With the endorsement of the regulatory agency,&#13;
AISA agreed to use the condominial approach&#13;
to meet a proportion of its expansion targets&#13;
in El Alto.&#13;
- While the WSP-thanks to support from the&#13;
Swedish International Development Coope-&#13;
ration Agency (SIDA)-agreed to finance the&#13;
research and training activities required to&#13;
transfer and adapt the condominial system&#13;
from Brazil to Bolivia.&#13;
Although condominial systems have been suc-&#13;
cessfully deployed in a number of cities around&#13;
Brazil, the EAPP is believed to represent the first&#13;
attempt to export the approach to another country&#13;
with very different socioeconomic and sectorol&#13;
conditions. Furthermore, the Brazilian experience&#13;
of condominial systems has always been in the&#13;
context of public sector service provision. The&#13;
EAPP applies the model, for the first time, in the&#13;
context of private sector porticipation. It therefore&#13;
provides an opportunity to establish whether the&#13;
social work component of the methodology is&#13;
compatible with the modus operandi of a private&#13;
utility. For both of these reasons, the experience&#13;
is of interest not only in Bolivia, but to other&#13;
countries who may wish to experiment with the                                                     U)&#13;

In order to value the opportunity cost of time for&#13;

will be used                                     -&#13;

respectively in terms of connection charges, an&#13;
aggregate value equivalent to 80% of monthly&#13;
household   income   However, when     the&#13;
opportunity cost of the household's time is fully&#13;
accounted for, the saving disappears for the water&#13;
service and for the sewerage service is reduced to&#13;
US$58 (or about 50% of monthly household&#13;
income) If connection charges were more closely&#13;
aligned with underlying cost, households would&#13;
spend more on obtaining a condominial&#13;
connection than they do at present, but the savings&#13;
relative to the conventional system would also be&#13;
larger. They would increase to US$1 09 for water&#13;
and US$1 26 for sewerage (together equivalent to&#13;
nearly 200% of monthly household income) As&#13;
before, when the opportunity costs of time are&#13;
taken into account, the savings are somewhat&#13;
reduced to US$90 for water and US$104 for&#13;
sewerage (in total equivolent to 160% of&#13;
household income).&#13;

This is based on data for average earnings of workers in El Alto from the 1999 Encuesto de Hogares, which ore lust under $ 100 per&#13;
month. The average number of hours worked per week is 50, which is taken to represent 6 days of work per week, or 24 days over&#13;
the month. Hence, the average doily wage is just over $4.14.&#13;
5This problem offected the projects at Villa lngenio (UV-4), El Rosal Lloreto ond Kupini II.&#13;
6 The average relotes to the following neighborhoods: Alto Ciudadela (Ports I and 11), Huacatoqui, ond Bartolina Siso, This overage&#13;
excludes one exceptionally difficult neighborhood, Pefio Azul, where the cost per connedion proved to beos high as US$811 Including&#13;
this neighborhood in the calculation, raises the average cost per connedion to US$403.&#13;
IThis breakdown is made by considering the roles of different team members. The training of local professionols in the design and&#13;
implementation of condominiol systems was largely undertoken byAdelo Martinez, Mery Quit6n, Fernando Inchouste ond Alfonso&#13;
Nueva. Whereas, the adaptation of the opproach together with the 'training of the trainers'wos undertaken primorily by Luiz Lobo (Teom&#13;
Leader)&#13;

principal asset rotio for this category ot 64.2%.&#13;

To fully remove the effects of seosonaity o full year's average before and ofter would have been ideal. However there was not sufficient&#13;
data after the event to permit this By looking at the some six month period, at least one con be sure that the differential is due to the&#13;
presence of a bathroom rather than to varying consumption pattems at different times of year. Nonetheless, the size of the differential&#13;
will not necessarily be constont across the year.&#13;
12 This con be inferred from the fact thot the confidence interval for the difference between consumption before ond after the arrival of&#13;
sewerage spons the value zero.&#13;
13 This con be inferred from the fact that the confidence intervol for the difference between consumption before and after the arrival of&#13;
sewerage does not span the value zero.&#13;
4 The confidence intervals for the two consumption levels almost overlap. The upper bound for households without sewerage is 4.94&#13;
cubic meters per month, while the lower bound for households with sewerage but without bathrooms is 4.97. This difference is lust&#13;
significont at the 95% confidence level, but would not be at the 99% confidence level.&#13;
5 This con be inferred from the distance that exists between the upper bound of the first confidence intervol (5.85) and the lower bound&#13;
of the second confidence intervol (6.86).&#13;
6 This figure con be arrived at in a number of ways. First, the rote of bathroom construdion is 35% higher when hygiene education is&#13;
applied, and the presence of a bothroom on average odds 1.9 (cross-sectional) to 2.0 (time-senes Huoyno Potosi) cubic meters per&#13;
month to consumption Thus, the overall effect is (0.35*1 95) = 0.68 cubic meters permonth. Altemotively, the installations thatodd&#13;
significantly to water consumption are the shower, the laundry sink and the kitchen sink. The coveroge of these instollations is&#13;
respedively 24%, 33% and 12%/o higher in neighborhoods receiving hygiene education, ond the consumption differential is on average&#13;
I cubic meter, I cubic meter and 1.5 cubic meters. Thus, the overall effect is (I '0.24 + 1 *0.33 + 1.510.12) = 0.75 cubic meters&#13;
per month. This result is consistent with the preceding one&#13;
17 That is to soy that in about 35% of households consumption rises by about 30%, so thot overoll consumption rises by about 10%.&#13;
18 Evidently, both of these ossumptions are highly questionable. On the one hand, a tankered supply is so different in noture from an in-&#13;
house connedion thot the two points ore unlikely to be on the some demand function. On the other hand, there is no reason why the&#13;
demand fundion should be linear; although, neither is there any a priori reason to expect it to be onything else.&#13;
9 The linear demand curve resulting from these two points has an elasticity of only -0.04 ot the current price of water. Since this volue&#13;
is implausibly low, some sensitivity analysis wos performed by lowering the price of tankered water until the pnce elasticity rose to a more&#13;
'typicol' ronge (-0 3 to -0.7). Fortunately, the increase in consumer surplus is very robust to these variations, remaining in the interval&#13;
$2-$3 per month.&#13;

            Condominial water and sewerage systems -
            costs of implementation of the model : an economic and
            financial evaluation of El Alto Pilot Project in Bolivia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The report undertakes the economic, and
            financial evaluation of El Alto Pilot Project (EAPP), aimed
            at transferring the condominial water, and sewerage system
            from Brazil to Bolivia, and testing its applicability in the
            context of private sector participation in service
            provision. Since 1998, the EAPP provided condominial water
            connections to households in eight neighborhoods of El Alto,
            and condominial sewerage connections in nine neighborhoods.
            However, according to recent statistics, sixty percent of
            these households live below the poverty line. The report
            questions the relevancy, beyond Bolivia, on the extent of
            the project results, arguing that the peculiar cultural,
            geographical, and social circumstances of El Alto, makes a
            difficult test for the condominial approach, where factors
            that limited its benefits, may not necessarily hamper its
            development in other contexts to the same degree. Such
            factors included the exceptionally low levels of household
            consumption, and experienced difficulties in inducing the
            community to switch to modern hygiene practices, for a
            variety of cultural reasons. While results of the EAPP
            evaluation should thus be specific to El Alto context, in
            qualitative terms, they are indicative of what can be
            achieved through this approach: innovative engineering
            design of networks; community participation; hygiene
            education; and micro-credit financing.
