A. BACKGROUND&#13;
The Health Care System and Health Status Prior to the War&#13;
1.     By the end of the 1980s, the contrast between the development of health care&#13;
services and the uneven achievements in health status suggested that systemic problems were&#13;
limiting further progress in health outcomes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On the one hand, the&#13;
system had achieved remarkable coverage and the use of high technology; on the other hand,&#13;
some key health status indicators still showed low achievements.&#13;
2.      Like most other formerly socialist economies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE),&#13;
Bosnia-Herzegovina had a well developed health system. The population enjoyed reasonable&#13;
access to a large network of clinics, hospitals and public health facilities, financed largely&#13;
through payroll taxes and general revenues. There were 5.8 beds per 1,000 population and&#13;
2.6 doctors per 1,000 population. Although these figures were average for CEE, they were&#13;
higher than those of most other developing countries at similar income levels. Total health&#13;
expenditure was around 6.5% of GDP in 1990, which was on the high side of the range&#13;
encountered in the region.&#13;
3.      Although substantial gains had been achieved in health outcomes during the two&#13;
decades preceding the war, the indicators of health status showed a mixed picture. The&#13;
infant mortality rate had declined from 56 per 1,000 live births in 1970 to 21 per 1,000 live&#13;
births in 1991. But, partially due to the weak primary care network, the percentage of&#13;
infants immunized against childhood illnesses in 1991 was less than in other European&#13;
socialist economies, with the exception of the former USSR. While the age-standardized&#13;
mortality rate for communicable diseases, maternal and perinatal causes (87 per 100,000&#13;
population) was worse than the average of 52 per 100,000 for other European socialist&#13;
countries, the life expectancy of 73 years at birth was at the higher end of the range observed&#13;
in the region.&#13;
4.      The pre-war health system suffered from a number of problems. A supply-&#13;
dominated approach to centralized planning had led to the proliferation of large hospitals and&#13;
heavy reliance on specialized polyclinics, with relatively little attention to primary health care&#13;
or family practice. The centralized decision-making process did not encourage strategic&#13;
planning to achieve the most efficient use of resources. Instead, decisions were most often&#13;
the result of bureaucratic bargaining, rather than a rational assessment of needs and available&#13;
resources. Clinical decisions were not based on considerations of the effectiveness or costs&#13;
of the desired interventions. Mental health services were concentrated in large hospitals,&#13;
with prolonged admissions and few, if any, efforts to reintegrate patients into the community.&#13;
Some patients, women in particular, were abandoned in hospitals by their families, on&#13;
account of the social stigma associated with mental illnesses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 2 of 37&#13;
Impact of The War on Health Status and the Health Care Delivery System&#13;
5.      The armed conflict has put an enormous toll on the health status of the population.&#13;
Not only have the common indicators of health status showed a dramatic quantitative&#13;
deterioration, placing BH at a level comparable to low-middle income economies, such as&#13;
Tunisia, Paraguay or the Philippines, but the mix of diseases has changed significantly. This&#13;
implies that the future health care interventions will have to respond not only to the increased&#13;
size of the problem but also to the unusual blend of the current burden of disease.&#13;
6.      The deterioration in living conditions, malnutrition, intense psychological stress and&#13;
loss of access to basic health services have caused dramatic declines in the overall health&#13;
status of the population, which are likely to be more severe in rural areas and isolated&#13;
enclaves. Based on information from Sarajevo, the infant mortality rate is estimated to have&#13;
doubled, reaching an average of 30 to 40 per 1,000 live births in urban areas. The incidence&#13;
of serious congenital malformations rose from 0.7% to 2.1% of births during the war.&#13;
Almost 25% of these malformations were anencephalus (absence of a brain) or hydrocephalus&#13;
(excessive water in the brain), which could have been detected during the pre-natal period&#13;
and managed appropriately, if access to, and functions of, diagnostic and treatment services&#13;
had not been severely interrupted during the war. Similarly, premature births have doubled,&#13;
while the average birth weight has dropped by more than 20%. The rate of perinatal&#13;
mortality rose from about 15.3 per 1,000 live births before the war to 38.6 per thousand&#13;
diring the conflict. Available data on morbidity show a two- to five-fold increase in the&#13;
number of people affected by epidemics and communicable diseases (influenza, tuberculosis,&#13;
hemorrhagic fever), with a surge in the number of fatal cases.&#13;
7.      In the area of reproductive health, family planning, as reflected by contraceptive&#13;
use, had never been given a high priority within the health care system of former&#13;
Yugoslavia'. As a result, the incidence of induced abortion was traditionally high. With the&#13;
onset of the war, the number of induced abortions increased significantly. Pre- and intra-&#13;
war data for Sarajevo indicate that abortions increased from a ratio of one for every birth to&#13;
at least two for every birth. The high rate of abortions, especially given the constrained&#13;
medical resources, and the reduced capacity to sterilize equipment, have created the condition&#13;
for subsequent low-grade infections and infertility. With the end of the conflict, particular&#13;
attention will need to be given to primary prevention of unwanted pregnancies with&#13;
contraceptives, as opposed to the dependency on abortion as a secondary prevention&#13;
technique, as well to infertility counselling and clinical services.&#13;
8.      Of particular importance to the choice and design of interventions, the war in BH&#13;
has induced an unusual mix in the burden of disease. For the Federation alone, in addition&#13;
to the estimated 250,000 persons killed, the total number of war-injured persons in BH is&#13;
'International Center for Migration and Health. ReDroductive Health and Pregnancv Outcomes Among&#13;
Displaced Women. Report of the Technical Working Group. October 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 3 of 37&#13;
reported to be about 175,000, of which over 50% are seriously injured. Moreover, the&#13;
incidence of stress disorders has increased dramatically on account of the war. The resulting&#13;
disabilities will place a heavy long-term burden on health and social services in BH, because&#13;
many of the injured and disabled will need long-term care, with physical and mental&#13;
rehabilitation, in addition to their initial acute medical care.&#13;
Physical Disabilities&#13;
9.      Estimates and Consequences of Physical Disabilities. As of December 1995,&#13;
12,296 disabled persons were registered and estimates of persons requiring physical&#13;
rehabilitation due to war injuries ranged from 40,000 to 70,000. The major causes of&#13;
injuries are bullet and shrapnel wounds resulting in the following major impairment and&#13;
disability groups (WHO/MOH, 1994): 3,000 to 5,000 amputations, 750 spinal cord injuries,&#13;
3,000 peripheral nerve injuries, 1,200 craniocerebral injuries, and an unspecified number of&#13;
soft tissue injuries and fractures. The burden on children is enormous. It is estimated that&#13;
more than 50,000 children have been wounded, half of them seriously. In the absence of&#13;
effective rehabilitation, physically disabled persons will be unable to resume or commence&#13;
economically productive activities and will constitute a substantial burden on the social&#13;
support system.&#13;
10.     Managing Physical Disabilities: Basic Principles.  Physically disabled persons&#13;
require one or more of the following, depending on the site and severity of their injuries and&#13;
disabilities: (i) surgery to remove irreversibly damaged parts, to limit continued damage and&#13;
to reconstruct parts of the body that remain viable; (ii) short-term hospital-based&#13;
rehabilitation following surgery; (iii) alleviation of pain with medications; (iv) artificial limbs&#13;
and devices to enable them to walk, use their arms and hands, as well as maintain healthy&#13;
physical postures (prostheses and orthoses); and (v) non-hospital based rehabilitation to ease&#13;
them into normal economic and social life. In addition, efforts will have to be made to&#13;
ensure that major public buildings and facilities, as well as workplaces, are accessible to the&#13;
physically disabled.&#13;
Psycho-Social Disabilities&#13;
11.    Increased Incidence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The war has also&#13;
taken its toll on the mental health of the population, with an estimated five-fold increase in&#13;
the incidence of PTSD, affecting both adults and children. PTSD is a collection of short-&#13;
term and long-term illnesses and disabilities caused by extremely distressing experiences such&#13;
as physical violence, war, rape and torture. Patients may suffer from severely altered and&#13;
labile moods, anxiety, depression, irritability and inability to function in seemingly normal&#13;
situations -- in sum, incapacitation at the individual, family and social levels. PTSD is&#13;
particularly severe when the victim perceives human malevolence as a cause of the stressful&#13;
experience. Persons suffering from PTSD may persistently reexperience the distressing&#13;
event, including recollections, dreams and acting as if the event were recurring. They may&#13;
persistently avoid situations even remotely associated with the event. Causes and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 4 of 37&#13;
consequences of PTSD are well documented, including studies following the Second World&#13;
War and the Vietnam War, and are clearly relevant to the recent history of BH. Persistent&#13;
reexperiences of war-related events are incompatible with a willingness to reconciliate with a&#13;
former enemy.&#13;
12.     Although it is difficult to gauge the extent of PTSD in BH, expert opinion suggests&#13;
that at least 15% of the population may experience mental distress severe enough to require&#13;
treatment. According to the Psychiatry Department of the Clinical Center in Sarajevo, the&#13;
incidence of stress disorders is highest among adult males aged between 25 and 44 years.&#13;
Some indication of the likely magnitude of PTSD in children is suggested by data from the&#13;
area of Srebrenica, where 545 children were orphaned and 10,000 were left with only one&#13;
parent. In addition to the soldiers who should soon return to civil life, initial surveys show&#13;
that large proportions of women and children (70% to 80% in some areas) have witnessed&#13;
war acts and atrocities, and have suffered psychological trauma likely to deeply imprint their&#13;
future behavior.&#13;
13.     Consequences of PTSD. The emphasis on rehabilitation of war victims is fully&#13;
justifiable. PTSD severely impairs the victims' capacity to function normally, dramatically&#13;
reducing their contribution to economic and social life. Its consequences include:&#13;
(i) markedly diminished interest in, and ability to perform, significant activities (in young&#13;
children, this results in impaired aptitude to learn and loss of acquired developmental skills&#13;
such as language); and (ii) irritability and inability to concentrate in individuals who were&#13;
apparently successful prior to the stressful event (diminishing adults' capacity to work&#13;
productively). To prevent and/or limit the duration of these states of impaired function,&#13;
PTSD can be successfully treated through combinations of medications, individual&#13;
counselling and psychotherapy, group therapy and assistance with re-entry into normal life.&#13;
14.      Other Disabilities. In addition to the war-injured population, there are those with&#13;
mental and physical disabilities due to non-war related acute and chronic diseases, including&#13;
developmental disabilities, neurological, musculoskeletal and cardiorespiratory disease and&#13;
degenerative disease processes. Children, women, refugees and the elderly are particularly&#13;
vulnerable members of the population due to isolation and breakdown of families and&#13;
community support systems. The limited availability of health services, poor nutrition and&#13;
limited rehabilitation services during the war have compounded these adverse effects.&#13;
15.     Since 1992, the infrastructure of the health sector has been severely affected by&#13;
war, resulting in major and persistent damage. The direct (damage or destruction due to&#13;
shelling) and indirect (absence of maintenance and repair due to lack of resources) effects of&#13;
the war have led to a collapse or loss of functionality of a significant part of hospitals, clinics&#13;
and other health care facilities. The destruction of hospital buildings has led to the&#13;
elimination of about 35% of beds and a loss of functionality of many others. Currently only&#13;
about 7,700 hospital beds remain "active" throughout the Federation (three beds per 1,000&#13;
inhabitants, about half of the pre-war total). It is estimated that more than US$300 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 5 of 37&#13;
worth of medical equipment has been destroyed, in addition to the equipment transferred&#13;
from civilian institutions to military hospitals during the conflict.&#13;
Infrastructure and Services for Rehabilitation&#13;
16.    Facilities for both physical and psycho-social rehabilitation, orthopedic surgery and&#13;
prosthetics in BH are very limited in what they can offer to victims of the war. Most&#13;
hospitals and primary health centers are unable to offer adequate services due to destruction&#13;
of physical infrastructure, lack of water and electricity, absence of maintenance and repair,&#13;
and (at best) intermittent supplies of drugs and consumables. Rehabilitative services are&#13;
severely compromised by the lack of an explicit conceptual framework that could be&#13;
modified in response to local variations among cantons, the limited availability of community&#13;
rehabilitation resources, the lack of occupational therapy services, limited availability of&#13;
equipment suitable for community and home use, and the absence of a reliable database on&#13;
disability incidence and prevalence.&#13;
17.    Physical Rehabilitation. Although the marked increase in the number of surgical&#13;
patients resulted in overutilization of available equipment and instruments, the necessary&#13;
maintenance could not be done due to a lack of supplies, spare parts and servicing. Most of&#13;
the instrumentation needs replacement, much of the equipment needs repairs and all&#13;
equipment needs regular service in the future. Additional instruments and equipment are&#13;
needed to enable the hospitals to cope with the current and anticipated high demand for&#13;
orthopedic and reconstructive surgery by war victims. The MOH's Working Group&#13;
identified 10 hospitals which are expected to support the centers for community-based&#13;
rehabilitation. Three of these hospitals have only general surgical departments while the&#13;
other seven (the Clinical Centers in Sarajevo, Mostar and Tuzla, the State Hospital in&#13;
Sarajevo, and the hospitals in Zenica, Bihac and Livno) already have orthopedic surgical&#13;
departments.&#13;
18.    Prior to the war, physical rehabilitation services, required on a relatively limited&#13;
scale compared to current needs, were based in hospitals and specialized rehabilitation&#13;
centers. Some of the hospitals with orthopedic and reconstructive surgical facilities also&#13;
provided physical rehabilitation services. In addition, during the war, community-based&#13;
rehabilitation (CBR) centers were established with the support of international humanitarian&#13;
aid organizations. In Sarajevo there are five CBR centers; one CBR center is located in the&#13;
dom zdravlja in Srebrenik, near Tuzia, and one center is located in Nemila, near Zenica. All&#13;
but one of these centers have been supported with equipment, minor structural alterations&#13;
and, importantly, education of personnel by Queen's University, Canada, with funding from&#13;
the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and a private donor. WHO is also&#13;
currently supporting the operation of one CBR center in Mostar and plans to support seven&#13;
additional centers throughout BH. Appendix 1 details the current situation of rehabilitation&#13;
services. The specialized Institute of Rehabilitation at Ilidza, which was a clinical and&#13;
educational center serving the Sarajevo area, was heavily damaged during the war and is no&#13;
longer functional.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 6 of 37&#13;
19.     There is a shortage of social workers and prosthetics technicians, and occupational&#13;
therapy is not available. Allied health personnel, including physical therapists and nurses,&#13;
are trained at secondary school level from the age of 14 years. Some students go on to a&#13;
higher level three-year program at medical high school. Programs for physical therapy are&#13;
offered at the University Rehabilitation Institutes in Tuzla and Sarajevo. Education and&#13;
training have been severely disrupted by damage to physical facilities, loss of and/or outdated&#13;
equipment, lack of learning resources, textbooks and scientific journals and loss of teaching&#13;
staff. There are no training programs for occupational therapists, and none for prosthetic&#13;
and orthotic technicians.&#13;
20.     Psycho-social Rehabilitation. Several organizations, including WHO, have&#13;
developed projects in the major centers throughout BH for psycho-social support to the&#13;
population affected by the war. The institution-based rehabilitation services have been&#13;
insufficient to meet the needs of persons with disabilities, largely due to inaccessibility, now&#13;
compounded by damage during the war. For example, the Neuropsychiatric Clinic&#13;
(Hospital) in Sarajevo was shelled about 40 times and has suffered major damage. Many&#13;
people live at a distance from the hospitals and transportation is inadequate. For those&#13;
unable to get to outpatient facilities, minimal home visiting services are available in a few&#13;
locations. In the absence of rehabilitation services in the communities to which patients can&#13;
be referred for ongoing care, the pre-war and current institutional systems call for longer&#13;
periods of inpatient treatment than necessary. In addition, institution-based care does not&#13;
address the many social and functional aspects of reintegration into the community, including&#13;
family life and employment. These issues are recognized by BH experts in psycho-social&#13;
rehabilitation who have decided to de-emphasize the institution-based approach in favor of a&#13;
community-based approach.&#13;
21.     Psycho-social rehabilitation services are also severely compromised by a lack of&#13;
staff through war casualties, migration, lack of sufficient training programs and lack of&#13;
remuneration. Rehabilitation services are provided primarily by psychiatrists, physical&#13;
therapists, and psychologists.&#13;
22.     Production Capabilities for Prostheses and Orthoses. There are currently seven&#13;
prostheses and orthoses production/maintenance units with different mandates, sizes and&#13;
quality. These units have been established and are managed by different governmental and&#13;
non-governmental organizations. With at least four production systems within BH (German,&#13;
Italian, Russian and French), standardization has become a priority. Beyond improved&#13;
coordination and standardization of systems, these production units require civil works&#13;
(repairs, rehabilitation and partial reconstruction of existing premises), equipment and&#13;
supplies to produce the needed quantity and quality of prostheses and orthoses, and skills&#13;
development for their personnel to improve productivity and quality of output. The status of&#13;
individual prosthetic/orthotic units is presented in detail in Appendix 2.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

B. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY: FROM EMERGENCY TO DEVELOPMENT&#13;
23.     With the end of the war, the health sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina faces a triple&#13;
challenge: to continue to function on an emergency basis for the short- to medium-term; to&#13;
undertake its recovery; and the transition to a modern efficient system. First, and for some&#13;
time to come, the sector professionals will continue to live and work under emergency-type&#13;
conditions. With still precarious living conditions, controllable epidemics will continue to&#13;
break out, and health services will still handle larger proportions of emergency cases and war&#13;
related injuries than any average country. Second, the reconstruction will have to start&#13;
without delay. Especially in light of severe resource constraints, this puts an enormous&#13;
pressure on sector authorities to prioritize activities and quickly plan large investments, in&#13;
many cases without access to all relevant information. Third, and highly critical, the&#13;
reconstruction effort must avoid rebuilding the unwieldy pre-war health system. This requires&#13;
that much attention be given to the right balance between modern primary health care&#13;
services and high quality but slimmer hospital services.&#13;
Developing a Medium-Term Strategy&#13;
24.     Initiating its response to the above-mentioned challenges, with the assistance of&#13;
WHO/EURO, the Government of BH has outlined the guiding principles for the development&#13;
of a national masterplan for the country's health sector recovery2. This document covers&#13;
both the short-term reconstruction needs, and the future structure and functions of the health&#13;
sector that could be achieved in the medium term.&#13;
25.     Five pillars have been identified in the masterplan: (i) health system design (sector&#13;
profile, health financing, administrative and organizational structures); (ii) human resources&#13;
development; (iii) development of the infrastructure and basic essentials (physical&#13;
reconstruction, medical equipment and supplies, pharmaceuticals, information systems); (iv)&#13;
public health programs (communicable diseases and epidemics, non-communicable diseases,&#13;
nutrition and health promotion, maternal and child health/ family planning, environmental&#13;
health; and (v) rehabilitation (physical and psycho-social/mental). These also constitute the&#13;
framework for the Task Forces that the Ministry has established or intends to establish for&#13;
specifying the reconstruction and reform masterplan.&#13;
lnmnediate Interventions to Reduce the Burden of Disability&#13;
26.     A complete reform of the physical and psycho-social rehabilitation services&#13;
constitutes one of the top priorities of the MOH strategy for the medium term. It is&#13;
recognized, however, that immediate interventions to reduce the enormous burden of&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 8 of 37&#13;
disability associated with the war require the formulation of a conceptually sound and&#13;
implementable national program. Accordingly, in early February 1996, the MOH established&#13;
a Technical Working Group of national experts in physical and psycho-social rehabilitation&#13;
with the mandate to develop a comprehensive National War Victims Rehabilitation Program.&#13;
The program, which is fully consistent with WHO's approach to community-based&#13;
rehabilitation, was prepared with the assistance of the World Bank and the technical support&#13;
of the Center for the Advancement of Community-Based Rehabilitation of Queen's&#13;
University3, which has implemented community-based rehabilitation services during the war&#13;
in BH. During the Bank's mission in February 1996, the Program was thoroughly assessed.&#13;
It constitutes a rational, comprehensive and cost-effective plan of actions for addressing&#13;
rehabilitation needs in BH.&#13;
27.     Further, the preparation of such a program carries a lot of promise for the future&#13;
development of the health care system in BH. First, the concept on which the program is&#13;
based constitutes a clear departure from the pre-war system. Physical and psycho-social&#13;
rehabilitation services are de-institutionalized. Hospital services are not excluded from the&#13;
program, they are an integral part of it. Although they are no longer the centerpiece, they&#13;
are the natural continuation of the community-based rehabilitation services, their natural&#13;
complement within a well thought-out referral system. Second, through the community-&#13;
based services, a modem concept of primary health care is being promoted, and it offers a&#13;
natural platform for the implementation of the medium-term reform objectives of the MOH.&#13;
In addition to its health, economic and social benefits, the CBR approach provides a timely&#13;
opportunity to initiate the transition of the health system from the pre-war reliance on&#13;
cumbersome and expensive hospitals to a prudent combination of sub-hospital level basic&#13;
health care and a high quality, streamlined hospital level. The investments in limited civil&#13;
works (remodelling/repairs of existing structures), training of personnel and supply of&#13;
equipment would, upon reductions in the needs for rehabilitative services, be readily&#13;
adaptable to other primary care services, the specifications of which would be determined&#13;
during implementation of the National War Victims Rehabilitation Program. The&#13;
investments in orthopedic and reconstructive surgical units are integral parts of essential&#13;
hospital services, which would be further developed as part of the national reconstruction&#13;
and reform efforts.&#13;
C. BANK ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
28.     The Bank's assistance strategy parallels and supports the Government's efforts. The&#13;
first step has been to gather the needed information in order to articulate, together with the&#13;
authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an overall sector recovery program. Within the broad&#13;
framework of the recovery program, the second step in Bank assistance has been and remains&#13;
3Supported by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 9 of 37&#13;
to help the Federation MOH develop its policies and specific priority programs for&#13;
reconstruction. Finally, the Bank, together with the international donor community, is&#13;
committed to supporting the financing and implementation of these programs through a series&#13;
of operations that are presented below.&#13;
Health Sector Recovery Program&#13;
29.     A Recovery Program for the Health Sector of the Republic of Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina, estimated at US$540 million has been submitted for consideration to the&#13;
international donor community. This program is part of the US$5.1 billion reconstruction&#13;
program that the Bank has been jointly developing with the Government and the donor&#13;
community. Out of this, estimates for the health sector recovery program for the Federation&#13;
of Bosnia and Herzegovina amount to US$440 million. The program encompasses all&#13;
priority areas that require immediate attention and support, in order to stop further&#13;
deterioration in the health status of the BH population and progressively rehabilitate the&#13;
health services delivery system. The Recovery Program also supports the efforts needed to&#13;
initiate structural reforms, thus guaranteeing the sector's sustainability in the recovering&#13;
economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&#13;

Bank-Supported Priority Interventions&#13;
30.    In the short term, the Bank will support a series of operations that cost-effectively&#13;
address the most relevant and pressing health issues with which BH is confronted. The&#13;
overall objective will be to minimize lost productivity and to alleviate suffering by reducing&#13;
the burden of disease on the most at-risk segments of the population, namely the direct&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 10 of 37&#13;
victims of the war, and the women and children of BH. Improvements in the areas presented&#13;
in Table 2 below will, however, extend much beyond these target groups. The entire&#13;
population of BH will benefit from the cost-effective health services the proposed operations&#13;
are intended to support, as they constitute the initial vehicles to carry out the fundamental&#13;
changes required by the BH health care system. The overall health sector recovery program&#13;
includes the entire State of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Contacts have been established with the&#13;
health authorities in the Republika Srpska (RS). Exchange of documentation has also&#13;
occurred and it is expected that further dialogue will be established and project preparation&#13;
initiated. Nevertheless, this first operation concerns only the Federation because it was not&#13;
possible at the time of appraisal to assess reconstruction needs, health programs and&#13;
institutional capacity in the Republika Srpska. The appraisal was based upon information&#13;
contained in the National War Victims Rehabilitation Program which was prepared by the&#13;
Federation Ministry of Health (MOH). Officials of the Republika Srpska have expressed&#13;
interest in the project approach, and are preparing information and proposals on needs for&#13;
war victims rehabilitation, in the expectation that future projects could support these actions.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 12 of 37&#13;
31.     Three Bank-supported operations are envisioned in the early stages of assistance to&#13;
the health sector of BH. First in the series is the proposed War Victims Rehabilitation&#13;
Project which is detailed below. The rationale for beginning with this Project has several&#13;
elements, among which are the desirability of: (i) selecting an intervention which could be&#13;
prepared rapidly and be ready for Board Presentation during the second quarter of 1996; (ii)&#13;
focussing on a self-contained, targeted set of activities; (iii) selecting a set of activities with&#13;
obvious and direct links to the conflict and which could unambiguously be considered as&#13;
urgent both politically and economically; (iv) selecting a set of activities whose rapid&#13;
implementation would not, on the one hand, require major prior policy decisions and on the&#13;
other impose rigidity on the system which might impair future reforms; and (v) starting with&#13;
a rather modest operation (US$30 million) in light of uncertainties concerning inputs from&#13;
other donors.&#13;
32.     Subsequent operations would address the other priority service needs presented in&#13;
Table 2, at the cantonal hospital and sub-hospital levels, respectively; these projects would&#13;
either include RS, or separate parallel operations would be developed. It is first envisioned&#13;
to develop an Essential Hospital Services Project that would focus on the needs of the&#13;
hospital sub-sector. The rationale is based on several factors, including: (i) the need to&#13;
address quickly the most pressing hospital issues within a rational framework, thereby&#13;
reducing the risk that uncoordinated, expensive and possibly unneeded investments in the&#13;
hospital sub-sector would jeopardize the overall sector sustainability; (ii) the need for more&#13;
time to resolve basic questions about the future conception and organization of sub-hospital&#13;
services; and (iii) the assumption that direct donor assistance would continue to be available&#13;
for some time for basic health services, as has been the case during the war, while the&#13;
strategic options for the reconstruction of a modem basic health care system were being&#13;
considered. The Essential Hospital Services Project would be ready for Board presentation&#13;
during the third trimester of 1996.&#13;
33.     The third operation, for which preparation would begin during the third quarter of&#13;
1996, would be the Basic Health Services Development Project, focussing on the sub-hospital&#13;
level. It would also tentatively support implementation of the most urgent Health Financing&#13;
Reforms that would initially be developed under the Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC), as&#13;
well as the early steps for developing a critically needed pharmaceutical policy in BH.&#13;
D. THE PROJECT&#13;
Project Objectives and Components&#13;
34.     The ultimate objectives of the War Victims Rehabilitation Proiect are to facilitate&#13;
the reintegration of war victims into economically productive activities and normal social&#13;
life, and to avoid the heavy costs of lost productivity and sustained disruption of the social&#13;
fabric of BH. Specifically, the Project is aimed at reducing the burden of physical and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 13 of 37&#13;
psycho-social disabilities through targeted and cost-effective rehabilitation services. In&#13;
pursuit of these objectives, the Project will include the following components:&#13;
a.      Community-Based Rehabilitation (estimated base cost US$12.6 million). This&#13;
component will address the rehabilitation needs of physically injured and&#13;
psychologically disabled war victims.&#13;
b.      Prostheses and Orthoses Production (estimated base cost US$6.0 million). This&#13;
component will support the production and maintenance of quality of prostheses and&#13;
orthoses in three production units and five maintenance units.&#13;
c.      Orthopedic and Reconstructive Surgery (estimated base cost US$8.5 million). This&#13;
component will improve the availability and quality of essential orthopedic and&#13;
reconstructive surgical services in three Clinical Centers and four Cantonal&#13;
hospitals.&#13;
d.      Project Implementation Support (estimated base cost US$1.8 million). The Project&#13;
will support the establishment and functions of a Project Implementation Unit to&#13;
manage the Project's activities.&#13;
35.     One of the most pressing issues faced by health authorities at the Federation and&#13;
cantonal levels is the need to restore salaries for health service professionals. However,&#13;
financing constraints prevented inclusion of salaries for health service professionals under the&#13;
proposed Project. If the current low level of remuneration of health professionals and the&#13;
irregularity of payments remain unaddressed, there is a substantial risk that the rate of&#13;
attrition of health professionals, especially the best qualified, could increase sharply, and/or&#13;
that professional commitment could erode. This could have serious negative effects on the&#13;
quality of health services delivered in general, and on the project-supported activities in&#13;
particular. Additional donor financing devoted to supporting/complementing health&#13;
professionals' salaries could help alleviate this problem. Mechanisms to effectively allocate&#13;
and manage these potential resources are under preparation, but sources of such financial&#13;
assistance are yet to be identified.&#13;
Detailed Project Description&#13;
Community-Based Rehabilitation Component (estimated base cost US$12.6 million)&#13;
36.     Conceptual framework. The community-based rehabilitation (CBR) center will form&#13;
the core of this component. The location will depend on the demographics of each area, but&#13;
CBR centers will be located within existing health centers (dom zdravlias) and/or&#13;
ambulantas. The Project will not support the construction of new structures, but will instead&#13;
adapt existing structures to perform new functions. This approach is based on a conceptual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 14 of 37&#13;
framework of a continuum of essential diagnostic and treatment services provided at various&#13;
levels of the health care system. Injured or disabled persons live in the community, hence&#13;
the CBR center is particularly suited to serve as the entry point for patients entering the&#13;
rehabilitation system. The continuum of services, whose main features are illustrated in&#13;
Appendix 3, is organized as follows: (i) the patient enters the system at the CBR center; (ii)&#13;
diagnostic and curative services are delivered at the CBR center; (iii) if necessary, the patient&#13;
is referred from the CBR center to the orthopedic department or the psychiatric department&#13;
of the hospital, and/or the prostheses and orthoses production and maintenance units; (iv)&#13;
diagnostic and curative services are delivered in hospitals and prostheses/orthoses production&#13;
and maintenance units; (v) the patient returns to the CBR center and then back home; and&#13;
(vi) the patient is followed up, according to need, by means of home visits. The CBR&#13;
approach is strikingly different from the pre-war emphasis on prolonged hospital admissions&#13;
for persons with mental illness and physical disabilities. It focuses on delivering effective&#13;
services and achieving demonstrable outcomes using cost-effective interventions to facilitate&#13;
reintegration of patients into economically active and socially viable lives. Although the&#13;
project design specifies the conceptual framework and the functions of CBR centers, context-&#13;
specific modifications are required to operationalize the CBRs in the diverse cantons of the&#13;
Federation. The Project will support the implementation of regional networks of community-&#13;
physical rehabilitation services throughout BH.&#13;
Community-Based Physical Rehabilitation Sub-Component&#13;
37.      Design and Functions. The Project will provide priority rehabilitative physical&#13;
therapy and occupational therapy for an estimated 40,000 to 70,000 war-injured persons and&#13;
an estimated 2% to 3 % of the BH population who are physically disabled from non-war&#13;
related causes. Accordingly, the Project will improve rehabilitative services in the three&#13;
Clinical Centers existing in BH and five Cantonal Hospitals, and will support the&#13;
development and operation of a network of 30 CBR centers. These include the eight existing&#13;
centers (that will be further reinforced and supported) and three additional centers (possibly&#13;
Tuzla, Gorazde, Tomislavgrad/Mostar cantons) planned by the MOH with the support of&#13;
Queen's University/CIDA. Also included are the seven additional centers that WHO plans&#13;
to provide with technical support. Plans and decisions regarding the locations of new centers&#13;
and the amount of upgrading required by existing centers will be coordinated by the Project&#13;
Implementation Unit (PIU) to avoid duplication and to integrate NGO inputs.&#13;
38.     Civil Works. Equipment and Supplies. The Project will provide civil works for&#13;
repairs/remodelling, furniture, equipment and supplies to establish 22 CBR centers, upgrade&#13;
the eight existing ones and support incremental operational expenditures in all of them.&#13;
Equipment and supplies will include those required for exercise therapy/kinesiotherapy;&#13;
electrotherapy equipment which may be used at the beneficiary's home; essential&#13;
pharmaceuticals; educational literature for patients and families; and filing cabinets,&#13;
computers, fax modems and printers for data collection, information presentation, record&#13;
keeping and communications. Funds will be provided to cover incremental recurrent&#13;
operating needs including electricity, water, gas supply; telecommunications services;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 15 of 37&#13;
maintenance of physical space and transportation costs for the team in charge of outreach&#13;
activities (fuel for personal vehicle or taxi fares). The Project will provide limited civil&#13;
works, equipment and essential pharmaceuticals and supplies in the three Clinical Centers&#13;
and five Cantonal Hospitals to provide acute rehabilitative care following surgical&#13;
intervention.&#13;
39.     Personnel and Training. The Project will support training in the principles and&#13;
practice of community-based rehabilitation and enhancement of clinical skills for&#13;
approximately 240 professionals involved in physical rehabilitation. Training will be&#13;
delivered at the university, hospital and CBR center levels. Learning resources will be&#13;
provided at all levels, for professionals delivering services and for persons with disabilities,&#13;
their families and volunteer social workers. Optimally, each CBR clinic/outreach service&#13;
should be staffed with one physician, four physiotherapists, one occupational therapist, one&#13;
nurse and one receptionist (both part time). The current shortage of clinicians, particularly&#13;
in smaller locations at a distance from the training centers, could initially create some&#13;
difficulties in finding appropriate numbers of qualified personnel to staff the CBR clinics.&#13;
This should progressively be offset through the training and retraining of additional&#13;
personnel.&#13;

Community-Based Psycho-Social Rehabilitation Sub-Component&#13;
40.      Design and Functions. A priority for this sub-component is to support the delivery&#13;
of services to those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other less&#13;
serious psychological illnesses, thus preventing chronic disability as well as promoting social&#13;
and professional reintegration. The Project will support the development and operation of a&#13;
network of 30 CBR centers for treatment of PTSD. It will provide acute psychiatric care in&#13;
hospitals and technical support to the network of CBR centers by upgrading rehabilitative&#13;
services in 14 hospitals. This sub-component will provide diagnostic services and treatment,&#13;
including individual psychotherapy, family counselling and family psychotherapy, home&#13;
visits, behavioral and conditioning techniques, medications, psycho-social support systems&#13;
and group therapy with others who have shared similar traumatic experiences.&#13;
41.     Civil Works. Equipment and Supplies. The Project will provide civil works for&#13;
repairs/remodelling, equipment, technical assistance, training, audiovisual equipment for&#13;
private and group counselling, as well as incremental recurrent costs to establish a network&#13;
of 30 CBR centers. It will provide limited civil works for repairs/remodelling, equipment,&#13;
supplies and essential pharmaceuticals to strengthen acute psychiatric care in 14 hospitals.&#13;
42.     Personnel and Training. The Project will support the training of 240 professionals&#13;
in the principles and practice of community-based psycho-social rehabilitation and skill&#13;
development for personnel. The proposed approach to service delivery is a major departure&#13;
from the pre-war situation, and it is clearly one with which the workers are not familiar. As&#13;
a result, external technical assistance will be required to train workers in: (i) the subject&#13;
matter of community-based psycho-social rehabilitation; (ii) the organization of service&#13;
delivery in the new system; (iii) effective techniques for communicating with patients; (iv)&#13;
the management of individual and group counselling sessions; and (v) self-assessment&#13;
methods for improving service delivery. Each center delivering psycho-social rehabilitation&#13;
services would be staffed with one psychiatrist, four nurses, one social worker, one&#13;
occupational therapist, and one case worker.&#13;

43.     Selection criteria for beneficiary health facilities under the Community-Based&#13;
Rehabilitation Component. The criteria for selection of the CBR centers providing physical&#13;
and psycho-social rehabilitation under the Project will be as follows: (i) each CBR will be&#13;
located in an existing health facility, preferably a dom zdravlja (although physical CBR&#13;
centers and psycho-social CBR centers may be located in the same building, they will not be&#13;
in the same physical space); (ii) one CBR center will serve a population of approximately&#13;
70,000 to 90,000 people; (iii) the CBR centers will be located in the largest municipalities of&#13;
the canton, unless there are compelling and transparent reasons to locate them elsewhere; (iv)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 19 of 37&#13;
no municipality will have more than one CBR center, except on the basis of populations in&#13;
excess of 90,000; and (v) the canton and/or municipality must be in support of the location.&#13;
44.     Appropriate clinical practice requires that the locations of post-surgical short-term&#13;
therapy be the same as the locations of the surgical facilities. The criteria for selection of&#13;
hospitals to provide acute care rehabilitation are as follows: (i) the hospitals must have&#13;
remained active throughout the war (this criterion is intended to prevent indiscriminate&#13;
reconstruction of facilities that were eliminated by the war; (ii) each hospital will serve a&#13;
population of approximately 300,000 to 350,000 people; (iii) the hospitals must have had&#13;
physical rehabilitation facilities before the war; (iv) each hospital's location must be such that&#13;
it can support a network of three or four CBR centers; and (v) no municipality will have&#13;
more than one project-supported hospital with physical rehabilitation facility.&#13;
45.     As for the hospitals supporting psycho-social rehabilitation activities, criteria for&#13;
selection are as follows: (i) the hospitals must have remained active throughout the war (this&#13;
criterion is intended to prevent indiscriminate rehabilitation of facilities that were destroyed&#13;
during the war); (ii) each hospital will serve a population of approximately 180,000 people;&#13;
(iii) each hospital must have delivered acute psychiatric services before the war; (iv) each&#13;
hospital's location must be such that it can support a network of three or four CBR centers;&#13;
(v) no municipality will have more than one project-supported hospital with acute psychiatric&#13;
care facility.&#13;
Prostheses and Orthoses Production Component (estimated base cost US$6.0 million)&#13;
46.     The Project will support the production of good quality prostheses and orthoses in&#13;
three production units related to the three Clinical Centers orthopedic departments. In&#13;
addition, five maintenance/service units will also receive support. The production and&#13;
maintenance units currently function under a variety of ownerships (government and NGOs),&#13;
receive material and technical support from various sources, and use a variety of&#13;
uncoordinated production techniques and standards. The criteria for selecting the units to be&#13;
supported by the Project are the following: (i) ownership by the municipal, canton or&#13;
Federation Government, or official collaboration with, and recognition by, one of these&#13;
levels of government; (ii) the unit must be established; (iii) the location of the unit must be&#13;
such that it is within the same municipality or canton as a project-supported orthopedic and&#13;
reconstructive surgical unit and its associated network of CBR centers; (iv) the unit must sign&#13;
a commitment to upgrade and or/change to standardized production methods; (v) the unit's&#13;
selection must be formally approved by the MOH; (vi) no municipality or canton will have&#13;
more than one project-supported prostheses and orthoses production unit; and (vii) no&#13;
municipality or canton will have more than one project-supported prostheses and orthoses&#13;
maintenance unit. The estimated target population is 3,000-5,000 known amputees, plus new&#13;
cases anticipated due to injuries from land mines and non-war related accidents.&#13;
47.     Civil Works. Equipment and Supplies. The Project will provide limited civil&#13;
works, machinery and raw materials to the specified production units. In one of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 20 of 37&#13;
production units (to be selected by the Ministry of Health with review by the Bank), the&#13;
Project will provide equipment and supplies to develop a capacity for the production of upper&#13;
limb prostheses.&#13;
48.     Capacity building. The Project will provide in-service training for approximately 75&#13;
workers through external technical assistance. Training will emphasize practical skills,&#13;
coordination and standardization of production systems. Following detailed assessments of&#13;
each production/ maintenance unit to be upgraded, the Project would provide technical&#13;
assistance for the introduction of modem production techniques. In Neretva, for example,&#13;
the production process currently has up to six persons involved in the making of one&#13;
prosthesis. This means that no one can take full responsibility in the rehabilitation process of&#13;
a particular patient and the patient has no direct "partner" to address in this important part of&#13;
the physical rehabilitation process. There is, therefore, an urgent need for training and&#13;
introduction of modem production techniques. External technical assistance is required and&#13;
will be provided to facilitate implementation of this component, focussing on: (i) the use of&#13;
efficient production techniques; (ii) improvements in the quality of prostheses and orthoses;&#13;
and (iii) the standardization of production systems by the MOH and the Professional Team&#13;
(para. 59). A major reduction of the existing personnel and concurrent recruitment of&#13;
enthusiastic young technicians should be done in order to increase productivity.&#13;

Orthopedic and Reconstructive Surgery Component (estimated base cost US$8.5 million)&#13;
49.     This component will upgrade essential orthopedic and reconstructive surgical&#13;
services in the three Clinical Centers and four Cantonal Hospitals, to be selected according to&#13;
the following criteria: (i) the hospitals must have remained active throughout the war (this&#13;
criterion is intended to prevent indiscriminate rehabilitation of facilities that were destroyed&#13;
by the conflict; (ii) each hospital will serve a population of approximately 300,000 to&#13;
500,000 people; (iii) the hospitals must have had orthopedic and reconstructive surgical&#13;
facilities before the war; (iv) each hospital's location must be such that it can support a&#13;
network of three of four CBR centers; and (v) no municipality or canton will have more than&#13;
one project-supported hospital with an orthopedic and reconstructive surgical facility.&#13;
50.     Civil works. Equipment and Supplies. The Project will provide limited civil works,&#13;
surgical instruments, supplies and pharmaceuticals to enable the selected orthopedic and&#13;
reconstructive surgical units to function effectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 22 of 37&#13;
51.     Personnel and Training. The Project will provide training for approximately 56&#13;
professionals providing orthopedic and reconstructive surgical services. From each of the&#13;
hospitals, a team of two orthopedic surgeons, one anesthetist and one theater nurse will&#13;
receive in-service training in centers of excellence abroad during the Project. The training&#13;
would be of a duration of about three months. By this means the entire team would learn the&#13;
modern surgical, anesthetic, post-operative and intensive care techniques which they would&#13;
apply in their hospitals after their return and which they would then teach to the rest of the&#13;
hospital staff using the new instruments and equipment to be provided by the Project.&#13;

Project Implementation Support Component (estimated base cost US$1.8 million)&#13;
52.     Given the very tight fiscal position of BH during the initial period of recovery from&#13;
the war, support would be provided to cover all required foreign and local costs of project&#13;
management as set out in the table below. This would include all needed investments (civil&#13;
works, office equipment, technical assistance and training) as well as recurrent expenditures&#13;
for two years of operation. Since the required management capacity is currently not&#13;
available in the MOH, a strong and dedicated Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be&#13;
created within the MOH. Necessary salary cost and other related operational expenditures&#13;
will be covered under the Project to facilitate the functioning of PIU.&#13;
53.     Experiences in a number of other CEE countries have shown weak implementation&#13;
capacities in ministries of health. This is equally true of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the&#13;
MOH has no history of implementing Bank-supported projects and is poorly equipped to&#13;
fulfill the responsibilities for managing a quick-disbursing operation. In light of these&#13;
considerations, the PIU will be adequately staffed and supported to enable it to function&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 23 of 37&#13;
effectively and efficiently (specific needs and arrangements for technical assistance to support&#13;
the PIU are described in Section E, "Institutional Arrangements and Implementation"). The&#13;
PIU will consist of a project director to manage and coordinate the implementation of the&#13;
Project; a procurement specialist to supervise tendering, purchasing and delivery of goods;&#13;
an accountant to maintain project financial records; an architect to coordinate and supervise&#13;
civil work activities; and administrative support staff, secretaries and translators. This core&#13;
staff will constitute the PIU "Technical Team" which will establish linkages between the&#13;
Federation MOH and Canton Administrations to ensure the timely implementation of the&#13;
Project. This approach would contribute to the development of an effective management&#13;
capacity in the MOH. A team of experts, comprised of members of working groups who&#13;
prepared the project proposals, will constitute the "Professional Team". Further details&#13;
regarding project organization are provided in paras. 58 - 59.&#13;

54.     Project Cost. The estimated total cost of the Project is US$30 million equivalent,&#13;
including physical contingencies of 3% on goods, technical assistance, training and recurrent&#13;
costs, and 7% on civil works. No price contingencies have been included given the expected&#13;
short disbursement period of this emergency Project. Investment costs (US$20.4 million&#13;
base cost) covering civil works, essential medical and production equipment and prostheses,&#13;
office equipment, furniture, vehicles, technical assistance, overseas and local training&#13;
constitute 70% of the total base cost. Recurrent costs (US$8.1 million base cost), including&#13;
medical supplies and materials, office supplies and materials, operating costs of facilities&#13;
(including electricity, heating, transportation, travel and accommodation expenses) constitute&#13;
30% of the total base cost. Detailed cost tables are found in Appendix 4.&#13;

55.    Financing Plan. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina would be the recipient&#13;
of the funds to be provided by various donors. To proceed quickly with implementation, a&#13;
phased financing formula is proposed. Grant financing of US$5.0 million from the Trust&#13;
Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina would be used to support initial project implementation&#13;
prior to Bank Group membership. Under the same documentation, Board approval will be&#13;
sought on a no-objection basis for additional financing of US$5.0 million on IDA terms, as&#13;
soon as IDA lending to Bosnia and Herzegovina commences. Co-financing in the amount of&#13;
US$20.0 million equivalent is being sought from the donor community. The Government of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 26 of 37&#13;
Italy has announced its intention to co-finance the Project in the amount of US$3.2 million&#13;
equivalent. Discussions are far advanced and agreement in principle has been reached with&#13;
the Council of Europe's Social Development Fund (ESDF), for co-financing of the Project in&#13;
the amount of US$5.0 million. In both cases, the details of the agreements will be finalized&#13;
after the Second Donors' Conference for Bosnia and Herzegovina in Brussels in April, 1996.&#13;
The Governments of Canada and of several European countries, as well as the European&#13;
Union have also expressed strong interest in co-financing the Project, and these co-financing&#13;
prospects should be firmed up following the Brussels Conference. If the mobilized resources&#13;
exceed US$20 million, it would be highly desirable to increase the scope of the Project to&#13;
include supplemental salary payments for health professionals. Provision for these payments&#13;
would be added to this Project or to the subsequent Essential Hospital Services Project if the&#13;
necessary donor financing -- amounting to about US$10 million over a twelve-month period -&#13;
- becomes available, and if the MOH develops a feasible plan, acceptable to both partners of&#13;
the Federation, for making these payments. If IDA financing and/or other needed&#13;
co-financing were not available for any reason following approval of the initial grant, the&#13;
project scope would be scaled down, with priority given to the Community Based&#13;
Rehabilitation services and the most urgent of the other planned activities. Such a reduction&#13;
would have an impact on the overall availability of rehabilitation services throughout the&#13;
country, but would not affect the Project's overall viability. The predominance of Bank&#13;
financing for Project Implementation Support is in recognition of the importance of this&#13;
component for ensuring successful implementation (see Project Risks, para. 93), and the fact&#13;
that there has been no pledge of assistance for this component from non-Bank sources.&#13;

56.    Taxes and Retroactive Financing. World Bank funds will be used to procure&#13;
specified project inputs net of taxes. Retroactive financing of up to 10% of the Grant will be&#13;
included for urgent purchases of project development and site preparation activities before&#13;
project effectiveness, incurred after January 31, 1996. To advance delivery/completion&#13;
further, advance contracting will be used to the maximum extent possible, subject to approval&#13;
and effectiveness of financing.&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
57.    The Project will follow accepted Bank procedures and as an emergency operation,&#13;
the Project has not been assigned an environmental category. However, the Project is not&#13;
expected to have any adverse environmental impact. All hospital-based and health center-&#13;
based services will incorporate appropriate and safe disposal of wastes. Upgrading of&#13;
prosthetic production facilities will ensure compliance with modern and safe waste disposal&#13;
standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 28 of 37&#13;
E. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Organization&#13;
58.    The Project will be implemented by the Federation MOH in close coordination and&#13;
collaboration with the related health authorities at the national and local levels: cantons,&#13;
municipalities, universities, NGOs, and other volunteer and donor agencies. To undertake its&#13;
Health Reform and Reconstruction Program (para. 24), the MOH has proposed the&#13;
establishment of a specific organization, including an Executive Office under the direct&#13;
authority of the Minister and Deputy Minister, with two main responsibilities: (i) the design&#13;
and implementation of the overall health sector recovery program, i.e., the five "pillars"&#13;
described in para. 25; and (ii) the coordination of donor activities.&#13;
59.     A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be established under the authority of the&#13;
MOH Executive Office. The PIU will be responsible for: (i) day-to-day management,&#13;
coordination and monitoring of project activities; and (ii) coordination of all other activities&#13;
in physical and psycho-social rehabilitation being funded by other donor agencies in addition&#13;
to those carried out through this Project. The Unit will be headed by a project director and&#13;
will be supported in its work by two core groups: a full-time technical team and a part-time&#13;
professional team. The technical team will be responsible for the more traditional&#13;
implementation activities: civil works, procurement, accounting, etc. The professional team&#13;
(comprised of members of the MOH working group which prepared the National War&#13;
Victims Rehabilitation Program), will participate in implementation from the perspective of&#13;
experts in physical and psycho-social rehabilitation, providing technical advice and expertise&#13;
to the PIU. This type of support is important since MOH staff lack the skills and experience&#13;
with the CBR approach adopted under the Project. This Professional Team will be employed&#13;
on a part-time basis (estimated 1/3 time).&#13;
Project Implementation Arrangements&#13;
60.     Project activities will take place in selected health facilities throughout the country.&#13;
On the basis of agreed criteria defined by the MOH/PIU (design and implementation plan&#13;
finalized by the PIU Professional Team), local authorities will select the sites of the facilities,&#13;
finalize equipment lists and recipient institutions, and agree on operational and administrative&#13;
procedures. The PIU will provide assistance in these tasks. Since ownership, participation&#13;
and commitment of the local health authorities are critical for the successful implementation&#13;
of the Project, much attention will be given to this process. The objective will be to reach a&#13;
"contractual agreement" between local authorities and the MOH, under which the local&#13;
authorities commit to undertake the agreed activities, and the MOH (through the PIU) would&#13;
provide the needed resources to implement the said activities. Such a "contractual&#13;
agreement" does not constitute an on-lending instrument: all resources will remain under the&#13;
control of the MOH/PIU that will make them available to local authorities according to the&#13;
implementation schedule. The implementation arrangements for major activity areas are&#13;
described below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 29 of 37&#13;
61.     As soon as possible after Grant effectiveness, if not before, a Project Launch&#13;
Workshop will be organized by the PIU. In addition to the authorities of the MOH and the&#13;
PIU, this workshop will involve all responsible staff at the national, cantonal and municipal&#13;
levels and responsible staff in the health facilities supported under the Project. The purpose&#13;
of the workshop will be to: (i) review the project concept and activities; (ii) confirm the role&#13;
and responsibilities of each level of authority and implementation; (iii) confirm and/or select&#13;
the location of facilities to be supported under the Project in accordance with the agreed&#13;
criteria; and (iv) finalize and agree on the implementation schedule. Within 30 days&#13;
following the launch workshop, a procurement workshop involving all persons concerned&#13;
with procurement, including the PIU, the Procurement Agent and the members of the&#13;
Procurement Review Committee, will be organized by the PIU to review, explain and assign&#13;
responsibilities for the procurement procedures set forth under the Project.&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
62.     Given the very limited implementation capacity of the MOH and the short duration&#13;
of the Project, technical assistance from a civil works management firm will be needed by&#13;
the PIU for: (i) assessing the needs for upgrading/remodelling of hospital departments,&#13;
prosthesis production units and CBR centers; (ii) preparing civil works design and tender&#13;
documents; (iii) carrying out tendering and selection procedures; and (iv) supervising civil&#13;
works. It is proposed that this civil work management support be provided by the&#13;
International Management Group (IMG) which is financed by the EU4. IMG has extensive&#13;
prior experience in the required functions, and is currently organized and staffed in all parts&#13;
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The PIU (specifically, the PIU architect with the Professional&#13;
Team) will be responsible for defining functional requirements and standards, for approving&#13;
all documentation prepared by IMG, and for authorizing payments based on the reports and&#13;
invoices received regularly from the contractors through IMG. Given the dispersed nature&#13;
and small size of the packages of works (mainly renovation), civil works will be tendered&#13;
through Simplified National Competitive Bidding (SNCB) (para. 81).&#13;
Procurement of Goods and Supplies&#13;
63.     The lists of equipment, materials, supplies, and furniture to be procured and their&#13;
allocation to beneficiaries will be finalized by the PIU/MOH in consultation with the local&#13;
health authorities, as part of the "contractual agreement". The procurement of equipment&#13;
and medical supplies will be handled by a Procurement Agent (PA) to be contracted&#13;
following a competitive process. Recruitment of the PA should be completed within 30 days&#13;
following the establishment of the PIU. The PA will be responsible for: (i) preparing&#13;
technical specifications and tender documents; (ii) carrying out tendering procedures and&#13;
developing evaluation and selection criteria; and (iii) evaluating proposals on behalf of, and&#13;
41n the unlikely event that the European Union would not finance IMG for this Project, a civil work&#13;
management firm would be selected on a competitive basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 30 of 37&#13;
in coordination with, the PIU/MOH. The PA will also be responsible for inspecting the&#13;
delivery and installation of the equipment, certifying payments in accordance with contract&#13;
conditions and supervising the in-service training programs to be provided by the suppliers&#13;
that will then be authorized by the PIU. To ensure that the procurement of works, goods&#13;
and services is carried out in accordance with the procedures set for that purpose, a&#13;
Procurement Review Committee will be established and will be responsible for the approval&#13;
of final recommendations of contract award (ref. para. 82).&#13;
64.    Considering the expected size of procurement packages, the medical equipment,&#13;
pharmaceutical, medical materials and supplies will be procured through International&#13;
Shopping (IS) (para. 77). Vehicles, furniture and office supplies will be procured through&#13;
National Shopping (NS) (para. 78). Depending on the final size of the procurement&#13;
packages, office equipment including PCs and printers, photocopy and fax machines will be&#13;
procured either through IS or NS. Details of procurement packages are given in Appendix&#13;
5.&#13;
Implementation of Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR) Component&#13;
65.    The CBR component will be implemented in the cantonal health facilities with the&#13;
technical assistance provided by the PIU Professional Team and international assistance&#13;
procured through the PIU. This international TA will be provided at two levels: (i) for the&#13;
overall program design, development and management at the central level (PIU); and (ii) for&#13;
operational and logistic support for the implementation of the on-site training at the local&#13;
(facility) level. The criteria for the selection of the agency(ies) to provide technical&#13;
assistance at the central and/or local levels will include skills and prior experience in: (a) the&#13;
development and implementation of community-based strategies in the field of physical and&#13;
psycho-social rehabilitation; (b) curriculum design; and (c) providing logistics for&#13;
multifaceted projects to be implemented in several locations.&#13;
66.     One of the first steps in the implementation of the CBR component is the&#13;
organization of a series of workshops following the "contractual agreement" reached with the&#13;
local health authorities. The purpose of the workshops, to be developed by the PIU/MOH&#13;
with the support of the TA agency(ies), is to present the conceptual framework of the federal&#13;
program and to assist in developing local implementation strategies and a detailed program&#13;
for each canton. The local implementation programs will include: (i) the implementation&#13;
schedule; (ii) the location of each CBR center; (iii) a staffing plan; and (iv) the lists of&#13;
equipment to be procured for each CBR center. With the completion of each workshop, and&#13;
once the various inputs will have been procured by the PIU, the local health authorities will&#13;
be in a position to proceed with the implementation of the CBR program activities.&#13;
67.    The on-site training under this component will begin with the establishment of the&#13;
CBR centers by the local health authorities with support of the PIU/MOH. Technical&#13;
assistance and logistic support will be provided at the local level in implementing on-site&#13;
training programs. Technical assistance will include at least one trained occupational and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 31 of 37&#13;
physical therapist working at each CBR for a period of six to eight weeks. Such assistance&#13;
will be procured through short-listing (SL) or sole-sourcing (SS) where and when&#13;
appropriate.&#13;
68.     The development of an Occupational and Physiotherapy Program (OT/PT) will be&#13;
supported through the Project. The University OT/PT program will be implemented by the&#13;
Medical Faculties of Universities of Sarajevo, Tuzla and Mostar. Technical assistance&#13;
(through the PIU at the central level), overseas training in rehabilitation for the educators&#13;
specialized in occupational and physiotherapy, and limited equipment and learning resources&#13;
will be provided under the Project for this purpose. Short-term overseas training programs&#13;
for the educators of these Universities will be organized by the PIU with the support of the&#13;
TA agency(ies). The technical assistance packages will be procured through short-listing&#13;
(SL) procedures or sole-sourcing (SS) if justified. Considering the specificity of such&#13;
services, training services will likely be procured through sole-sourcing.&#13;
69.     The Public Education and Health Promotion activities will be contracted out to an&#13;
organization, likely to be an association acting as a support group for disabled and very&#13;
likely through sole-sourcing (SS). This organization will be supported by the (central)&#13;
international technical assistance. This activity will include training and employment of war&#13;
disabled persons in the production, management and marketing of promotional materials,&#13;
with emphasis on disability prevention and health promotion.&#13;
Implementation of Orthopedic and Reconstructive (O&amp;R) Surgery Component&#13;
70.     The activities under this component include: (i) rehabilitating facilities and providing&#13;
essential equipment and medical supplies for the Orthopedic and Reconstructive Surgical&#13;
units of seven selected hospitals (three Clinical Centers and four cantonal hospitals); and (ii)&#13;
short-term overseas training for the staff of these units. The implementation arrangements&#13;
for the civil works and procurement of equipment are described earlier (paras. 61-63).&#13;
During each year of the Project, short-term overseas training will be provided for a group of&#13;
two orthopedic surgeons, one anaesthetist and one theater nurse from each of the selected&#13;
hospital facilities. Such overseas training will be procured through short-listing (SL) or sole-&#13;
sourcing (SS) where and when appropriate. The teams will apply modern surgical,&#13;
anesthesiological and postoperative/intensive-care techniques in their "home-hospital" upon&#13;
their return.&#13;
Implementation of Prostheses and Orthoses (P&amp;O) Production Component&#13;
71.     The activities under this component include: (i) rehabilitating facilities and providing&#13;
essential equipment, raw material and supplies for the production of prostheses and orthoses&#13;
to the selected P&amp;O production and maintenance units; (ii) in-service training for the staff of&#13;
these units; and (iii) establishment of a database unit in the MOH. The implementation&#13;
arrangements for the civil works and procurement of equipment are described earlier (paras.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 32 of 37&#13;
61-63). International technical assistance will be procured to provide in-service training&#13;
programs which are to be implemented in these units.&#13;
72.    Technical assistance will be provided for creating a standardized Federation-wide&#13;
Data Base to collect and collate the information on amputees and disabled. Considering this&#13;
standardization and the proprietary nature of the production equipment procured under the&#13;
Project, such technical assistance may have to be procured through sole-sourcing (SS). All&#13;
prostheses and orthoses production units and the corresponding hospitals will be provided&#13;
with computers, each with printer and fax-modem and the suitable software. National&#13;
technical assistance will also be provided for software training. All units included in the&#13;
Project will provide monthly updates to the PIU/MOH.&#13;
Project Implementation Schedule&#13;
73.    The Project will be implemented over a two-year period. To allow for swift&#13;
implementation of this emergency-type operation, procedures for project implementation will&#13;
be kept simple. To secure the timely implementation of the Project, implementation&#13;
schedules have been developed for each component (Appendix 6).&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
Procurement of Goods&#13;
74.    The goods, including medical and essential equipment and supplies, office&#13;
equipment and supplies, furniture, vehicles and learning resources will be procured using&#13;
specified procedures. Pursuant to the decisions of the Bosnia Ad Hoc Advisory Committee&#13;
and given the size of the procurement packages (Appendix 5) packages will be procured&#13;
mainly through Limited International bidding (LIB), International Shopping (IS), National&#13;
Shopping (NS) and Direct Contracting (DC).&#13;
75.    Advertising. A General Procurement Notice (GPN, Appendix 7) will be published&#13;
in the Development Business in May/June 1996. The notice will include information about&#13;
the nature of the goods, works and services to be procured and invite interested and eligible&#13;
suppliers, contractors and consultants to send their expression of interest to the PIU. The&#13;
GPN will also be published in the local press. The GPN will be followed by specific&#13;
advertisements for individual contracts in the local press. Bidding documents will be sent to&#13;
suppliers who respond to the GPN and the specific advertisement. Expression of interest will&#13;
also be used to prepare Limited International Bidding lists.&#13;
76.    Limited International Bidding (LIB). LIB, tendering by invitation, will be used&#13;
for procurement packages estimated to cost over US$2.0 million and up to US$5.0 million&#13;
each. Exceptions to this threshold will be the cases where there will be only a limited&#13;
number of suppliers. It is unlikely that LIB will be used at all under this Project. As&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 33 of 37&#13;
presented in Appendix 6, it is expected that all procurement packages will be under the&#13;
US$2.0 million threshold, therefore being procured, through International or National&#13;
Shopping (IS, NS) or Direct Contracting (DC) (see below).&#13;
(a) List of LIB Bidders. The list of suppliers will be compiled based on the&#13;
expressions of interest received in response to the General Procurement Notice as&#13;
well as other sources, such as the Procurement Agent's own experience. The list&#13;
will be as broad as possible. List of suppliers for LIB packages will be subject to&#13;
the Bank's prior approval.&#13;
(b) Bidding Documents for LIB. The Bank's Standard Bidding documents will be&#13;
used. In order to expedite the process, LIB bidding documents will be sent by fax.&#13;
77.    International Shopping (IS). Procedures for IS will be used for equipment and&#13;
materials or standard specification commodities estimated to cost between US$200,000 and&#13;
US$ 2.0 million per contract. IS will be based on comparing price quotations obtained from&#13;
at least three suppliers from two eligible countries in accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
78.    National Shopping (NS). NS will be used for contracts for goods available in&#13;
Bosnia Herzegovina up to an estimated cost US$ 200,000 per contract with at least three&#13;
quotations.&#13;
79.    Direct Contracting (DC). DC will be used for proprietary items, for reasons of&#13;
compatibility and standardization, and in any other justified case. Any direct contracting&#13;
during project implementation will need prior Bank approval.&#13;
80.    Recurrent Costs/Incremental Operating Costs. Recurrent Costs/Incremental&#13;
Operating Costs will be procured as follows: PIU staffing will be procured under&#13;
procurement procedures for consultants' services, and mostly on a sole source basis. Office&#13;
supplies, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, rental and other services will be procured&#13;
through NS or IS, according to the availability of required items in Bosnia and Herzegovina,&#13;
and the size of the procurement packages, and will follow the provisions set for NS and IS.&#13;
Proprietary items such as gas and electricity will be procured through DC with local&#13;
companies.&#13;
Procurement of Works&#13;
81.    Given the nature of the works, mainly rehabilitation of existing facilities, Simplified&#13;
National Competitive Bidding (SNCB) will be used for contracts estimated to cost up to&#13;
US$ 1.0 million per contract. These works will be procured under lump sum, fixed price&#13;
contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified contractors in&#13;
response to a written invitation. The invitation shall include a detailed description of works,&#13;
including basic specifications, the required completion period, a basic form of agreement&#13;
acceptable to the Association and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award shall be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 34 of 37&#13;
made to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the required work and who&#13;
has the experience and resources to successfully complete the contract.&#13;
Procurement Review Committee&#13;
82.    As stated above in para. 63, to ensure that the procurement of works, goods and&#13;
services is carried out in accordance with the procedures set for that purpose, a Procurement&#13;
Review Committee will be established and will be responsible for the approval of final&#13;
recommendations of contract award. The Procurement Review Committee will be constituted&#13;
of a representative from the MOH, a representative from the PIU and two representatives&#13;
from the Clinical Centers and cantonal hospitals supported under the Project, and (for review&#13;
of contracts other than for civil works) a member of IMG. The establishment of this&#13;
Procurement Review Committee will be a condition of Grant effectiveness.&#13;
Procurement of Services&#13;
83.    Services will be procured through competition (short-listing) and sole-sourcing&#13;
where and when appropriate. Qualified institutions and firms will be invited to submit&#13;
proposals for comprehensive packages of consultant services and management of fellowships&#13;
and training in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981). Local staff for the&#13;
PIU will be procured through short-listing (SL) or, considering the fact that the Project&#13;
should contribute strengthening of the MOH, through sole-sourcing (SS) of staff currently&#13;
seconded to the MOH. To keep the evaluation process manageable, no more than six (but at&#13;
least three) proposals will be invited following a short listing acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Prior and Post Bank Review of Procurement Documents&#13;
84.    The Bank has prepared the invitation to quote and contract documents for&#13;
International Shopping, Simplified Bidding documents for NCB and a National Shopping&#13;
document for civil works. These documents would be used under the Project. Prior review&#13;
will be required for all contracts procured through Limited International Bidding (LIB) and&#13;
Direct Contracting (DC). Also, the first three contracts awarded through International&#13;
Shopping (IS) and through UN Agencies, will require prior review from the Bank. For&#13;
consultants' contracts, the Bank's standard form for consultants contracts will be used and&#13;
prior review for consultants contracts conducted as required. Post review of procurement&#13;
actions on a sample basis will be carried out during supervision missions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 35 of 37&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
85.    Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, the State Ministry of&#13;
Finance will establish under conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account in US&#13;
dollars in a commercial bank. The authorized allocation of the Special Account will be&#13;
limited to US$1.0 million, representing about four months of estimated average expenditures&#13;
expected to be paid from the Special Account. Replenishment applications will be forwarded&#13;
to the Bank at least every three months and must include reconciled bank statements as well&#13;
as other appropriate documents. For large contracts, such as medical equipment, the Bank&#13;
will make direct payments to suppliers.&#13;
86.     Statement of Expenditures. Disbursements will be made against Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs) for contracts for goods and works up to US$1.0 million equivalent,&#13;
except for the first three contracts procured under international shopping and through UN&#13;
Agencies. Statements of Expenditures will also be allowed for expenditures for incremental&#13;
operating costs, training, contracts with consultant's firms below US$100,000 and individuals&#13;
below US$50,000. Disbursements for contracts exceeding US$3.0 million equivalent will be&#13;
made against presentation to the Bank of full contract documentation. The Project&#13;
completion date will be June 30, 1998.&#13;
Accounts, Auditing and Reporting&#13;
87.     Accounts. Separate and auditable accounts would be established with the PIU&#13;
within MOH. These accounts would include: (i) a record of withdrawals with copies of all&#13;
disbursement requests and underlying documentation; and (ii) a record of transactions on the&#13;
special account and the copies of the bank statements on this account.&#13;
88.    Audits. The project accounts will be audited annually by independent auditors and&#13;
under terms and references acceptable to the Bank. Separate audit statements will be&#13;
prepared for the Special Account and for Statements of Expenditures. All audit reports will&#13;
be made available to the Bank, at the latest, six months after the end of the fiscal year.&#13;
Project accounts will be maintained for one year after they have been audited.&#13;
89.    Reporting. The PIU will prepare and furnish to the Bank a quarterly progress report&#13;
showing the status of implementation of the Project as well as a financial report in a format&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. The PIU will collect data from the Canton Administrations which&#13;
will compile short quarterly progress reports.&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
90.    Project implementation will incorporate a large degree of flexibility in order to&#13;
adapt to local implementation arrangements and rapidly changing circumstances in the&#13;
country. Implementation progress will be formally evaluated at mid-term, i.e., approximately&#13;
12 months after effectiveness. In addition, during the first 6 to 12 months of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 36 of 37&#13;
implementation, the Bank's Project Team (EC1/2HR staff in Budapest and Washington),&#13;
jointly with the Social Sectors Operations Officer of the Bank's Resident Mission in&#13;
Sarajevo, will continuously supervise all initial project implementation steps, and will assist&#13;
closely on matters requiring advice and rapid decision by the Bank. In particular,&#13;
procurement and disbursements will require intensive supervision, given the flexibility built&#13;
into implementation.&#13;
F. PROJECT BENEFITS, ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
Project Benefits and Economic Justification&#13;
91.     Benefits expected from the successful implementation of the Project fall into four&#13;
categories. First, the Project will contribute significantly to reducing human suffering, an&#13;
outcome that is impossible to quantify in and of itself. Beyond the numbers of physically&#13;
disabled (the amputees and paraplegics, but also all those who have been injured and are left&#13;
with some degree of disability) and of psychologically traumatized persons, there remains a&#13;
lot of suffering that could significantly influence the vision and hopes for the future of the&#13;
people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Second, and related to the first point, the reduction of&#13;
political instability is contingent upon the healing of the wounds associated with the war. On&#13;
all sides, injuries and trauma have been caused by neighbors, relations or friends. Relevant&#13;
therapy and care that the Project is intended to bring should facilitate progressive attainment&#13;
of a reasonable degree of social and political reconciliation. These are pre-conditions for&#13;
establishing a viable state. Finally, the Project constitutes the first opportunity given to the&#13;
Bosnian health sector to develop cost-effective organization and functions. The strong&#13;
emphasis on investments at the lower level of care (community-based) will pave the way for&#13;
developing future activities clearly departing from the pre-war reliance on institutionalized&#13;
care to a continuum of services anchored in the community. Moreover, through the&#13;
establishment of a strong PIU, the Project should enable the Federation MOH to&#13;
progressively resume its normal responsibilities in a rational way, enhancing its capacity for&#13;
planning and implementing needs-based service delivery.&#13;
92.     Economic Justification. On economic grounds, the Project will help reduce the lost&#13;
productivity that would otherwise continue to result from the enormous burden of disease and&#13;
disability due to physical and psycho-social trauma. By rehabilitating the victims of war, the&#13;
Project will help meet a precondition for their re-integration into the economically active&#13;
segment of society. The economic loss attributable to war inflicted physical disability and&#13;
trauma is extremely difficult to measure. However, based on the 1990 prevalence of these&#13;
conditions (intentional injuries and post traumatic stress disorders) and assuming that the&#13;
conflict has considerably increased their incidence (three to five times), the loss of national&#13;
production associated with the disabilities left untreated in the adult productive population&#13;
(male and female ages 15 - 59), the segment of the population producing the national wealth,&#13;
would range between 1 % and 2% of post-war GDP. Using 1.5 % and under the assumptions&#13;
that: (i) employment opportunities are available; and (ii) the Project would result in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex Page 37 of 37&#13;
restoration of 30% (a conservative assumption) of the lost ability to perform economic&#13;
activities, it is estimated that the net annual gain in GDP would range between US$8.0&#13;
million and US$16.0 million. using a GDP per capita of US$500 or US$1.000. respectively.&#13;
In any of these scenarios, this represents an unusually high return, fully justifying the&#13;
investments planned under the Project.&#13;
Project Risks&#13;
93.     The main risk associated with the Project is that limited implementation capacity&#13;
could delay its implementation. This risk will be mitigated through the setting up of a strong&#13;
Project Implementation Unit supported by qualified technical assistance and reliance on&#13;
professionals with the capacity for managing civil works and procurement. Turn-key&#13;
contracts will be used where and when appropriate. Project implementation could also suffer&#13;
from a shortage of co-financing. Active involvement of potential donors during project&#13;
preparation and effective communication from the Government could help to secure the&#13;
required co-financing. Finally, if the current low level of remuneration of health&#13;
professionals and irregularity of payments is not addressed, there is a substantial risk of&#13;
attrition of health professionals, especially the best qualified, and/or erosion of their&#13;
commitment. This would have serious negative effects on the quality of health services&#13;
delivered in general, and on the project-supported activities in particular. Additional donor&#13;
financing could help alleviate this risk by temporarily complementing salaries of health&#13;
professionals. Mechanisms to effectively allocate and manage these potential resources are&#13;
being prepared. Sources of such financial assistance are yet to be identified.&#13;

Appendix 1: The Status of Orthopedic and Reconstructive Surgical Units&#13;
State Hospital, Sarajevo: Out of 420 previously available beds this hospital now has&#13;
250, 60 of which are for the traumatology/orthopedic department. It functions as a regional&#13;
hospital. Out of a total of 7 operating theaters, one was destroyed during the war and 6 are&#13;
in good condition, and 2 of these belong to the traumatology/orthopedic department. These 2&#13;
require minor repairs. One intensive care unit was destroyed as well, but there is another&#13;
one with 20 beds, out of which 10 are allocated to the surgical departments. Some minor&#13;
repairs and replacement of broken glasses are required.&#13;
University Clinical Center Kosevo. Sarajevo: Out of more than 4,000 beds before the&#13;
war, the University Clinic now has 1,850. Apart from the traumatology/orthopedic&#13;
department there are 12 other surgical departments. To meet the demands of the large influx&#13;
of the war wounded, it was necessary to reorganize the health care system in the clinical&#13;
center. Orthopedics and traumatology became one combined department in the same building&#13;
with 5 theaters. Of these 5 theaters, 4 are in good condition and one needs replacement of&#13;
the floor covering. Some in-patient rooms need new windows. The intensive care unit is in&#13;
good condition. The access road from the entrance of the Clinical Center compound to the&#13;
clinic of traumatology/orthopedics is in very poor condition and unsuitable for seriously&#13;
injured patients.&#13;
Tuzla Hospital: According to the MOH, this hospital shall be the location of the&#13;
second medical faculty of the Federation. The traumatology/orthopedic department has 120&#13;
beds.&#13;
Zenica Hospital: This was one of the larger cantonal hospitals with tertiary-level&#13;
services. During the war it was developed through the help of the Danish government into a&#13;
big 1,200-bed rehabilitation clinic of high standard in which 40 to 50 beds are allocated to&#13;
the orthopedic department.&#13;
Mostar Hospital: This is a huge concrete building erected just before the outbreak of&#13;
the war, with almost all civil works already done. Assessments of the extent of damage due&#13;
to the war, the repairs needed and resources required for its completion need to be done by a&#13;
civil engineer. Mostar, according to the MOH, shall become the third major center of&#13;
university level health care in the Federation. The orthopedic/traumatology department has&#13;
a capacity of about 75 beds, located in temporary premises.&#13;
Livno Hospital: Located between Mostar and Bihac, this small cantonal hospital&#13;
offers tertiary-level services in its department of traumatology and orthopedics which has 30&#13;
to 40 beds.&#13;
Bihac Hospital: This is also a cantonal hospital, with a 40-bed orthopedic/&#13;
traumatology department.&#13;

Appendix 2: The Status of Prostheses Production and Maintenance Units&#13;
Central Prosthetics and Rehabilitation Unit in Sarajevo (Neretva). This unit was&#13;
expected to take substantial responsibilities for program design, monitoring and&#13;
implementation of the physical rehabilitation programs in the Sarajevo area, while the&#13;
regional centers would be created to implement the assistance to war victims in their&#13;
respective zones of activity. Allocation of the program resources from the center to the&#13;
periphery was supposed to be linked to regional plans of action. Neretva is currently not in&#13;
a position to fulfil these responsibilities. There are urgent needs for major changes in this&#13;
institution:&#13;
Work Methods: The work process needs altering, notably the present arrangement whereby&#13;
up to six persons are involved in the making of one prosthesis. This means that no one can&#13;
take full responsibility in the rehabilitating process of a particular patient and the patient has&#13;
no direct "partner" in this important part of the physical rehabilitation process. There is&#13;
therefore an urgent need for training and introduction of modern production techniques. It&#13;
will be important to appoint also an expatriate workshop manager who has the skills needed&#13;
for applying modern methods and for training others (minimum duration of assignment, 3&#13;
months).&#13;
Capacity Building: A major reduction of the existing personnel and concurrent recruitment&#13;
of enthusiastic young technicians should be the next step in the process of achieving&#13;
increased productivity. In-service management training through external technical assistance&#13;
should be a priority. The expatriate and his/her local counterpart could coordinate the&#13;
Federation-wide prosthetic and rehabilitation plan. As managers they should be situated in&#13;
Neretva, and as coordinators they should be attached to the Ministry of Health to coordinate&#13;
the implementation of the plan.&#13;
Supplies: For some time Neretva produced no prostheses because it had run out of raw&#13;
materials. Finally it received supplies in 1995 but still lacks other materials and sufficient&#13;
equipment to become the center for the whole Federation.&#13;
Civil Works: The Neretva workshops are still in two different buildings. The major&#13;
production unit is on the hill in church premisses where it occupies about 1700 m2. The&#13;
major rehabilitation unit is still in the Neretva owned building in the center of the town (on a&#13;
plot of about 800 m2) but major parts of the infrastructure are completely destroyed. For&#13;
this a complete reconstruction would be less expensive than rehabilitation and/or repairs of&#13;
the existing buildings. A new construction would also enable the construction of a 3-floor&#13;
building to accommodate Neretva again, with approximately 2,500 M2 in total. For the time&#13;
being it is planned that Neretva will move soon to a building behind (and belonging to) the&#13;
State Hospital.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2, Page 2 of 3&#13;
Center for the Production of Orthopedic Appliances. The small workshop in the&#13;
center of Sarajevo is run under the umbrella of the local NGO "Merhamet". The workshop&#13;
was equipped through funds from different national Caritas organizations through CRS. The&#13;
difference between the workshop of e.g. Neretva and this small unit is striking as one finds&#13;
here the most recent Otto Bock machines, rawlings and all other needed supplies for one&#13;
year, tools and physical rehabilitation equipment in renovated small building. Even more&#13;
impressive are the prostheses they fabricate. The two technicians produce prostheses of high&#13;
technical and aesthetic quality. This workshop could provide some competition for Neretva,&#13;
and it could be developed into the national center for upper limb prostheses, of which there&#13;
is none in the country. In-service training of about 3 months in the initial phase and&#13;
refresher courses would be required. No investments are required for civil works.&#13;
Tuzla Workshop. This workshop, which is managed by Handicap International,&#13;
produces only temporary prostheses for the initial phase after operation. As there are not&#13;
enough facilities for permanent prostheses the amputees use their temporary prostheses often&#13;
too long (several months, up to even 3 years). The fitting of a permanent prosthesis after&#13;
such a long time is very difficult and often reamputation is required. There are urgent needs&#13;
to "upgrade" this workshop into a unit which can produce good prosthesis as described&#13;
above. New machines, tools, equipment and operational supplies for at least 2 years will be&#13;
as needed, as well as training for the technicians. Major investments in civil works are not&#13;
expected as it would be wise to use the existing premisses of handicap international.&#13;
Zenica Workshop. This is an excellent workshop with very good equipment for 5&#13;
technicians. By the end of 1995, it had registered 944 patients, out of which 83 % had&#13;
lower limb amputations of different kinds. 379 of these prostheses are finished (40%).&#13;
Unfortunately the workshop "lost" all their skilled technicians which resulted in serious&#13;
degradation of the quality of work. In addition, the most recent rawlings delivered were of&#13;
poor quality, and the prostheses do not meet the required standard. They have to be replaced&#13;
after 3 to 4 years, whereas a good prosthesis should last at least 6 and can last up to 10&#13;
years. Minor repairs are required in the workshop, some equipment have to be replaced,&#13;
others added. There are urgent needs for supplies, consumables and very urgent in-service&#13;
training, which should be carried out together with the delivery and installation of the new&#13;
equipment.&#13;
Foinica. Fojnica is the site of the large national rehabilitation center. Some&#13;
responsible people in the Ministry of Health as well as the management of Neretva wanted&#13;
very much to establish a branch of Neretva near to the clinic to serve the patients of the&#13;
center, which should then become enlarged up to 700 beds capacity. In the context of the&#13;
now agreed community based approach it would be much more reasonable to do the&#13;
opposite, reducing the capacity of the rehabilitation center and putting more emphasis into&#13;
the community based structures (see below).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2, Page 3 of 3&#13;
Mostar. The unfinished building requires civil work investments for completion. It&#13;
also requires equipment to become operational. Currently there is only a small service&#13;
workshop, without major equipment, proper tools, consumables and supplies. In-service&#13;
training for at least 3 month would be required.&#13;
Bihac. Although Bihac was chosen already in the beginning of 1995 to be a&#13;
administrative as well as medical, orthopedic and traumatology/ reconstructive surgery&#13;
center, the new prosthetic workshop was just recently set up in Cazin, 26 km north of Bihac.&#13;
The German NGO "Johanniter Unfallhilfe" has equipped the small unit with Otto Bock&#13;
equipment and all necessary supplies which should last up to the end of the year. There are&#13;
no costs for civil works expected. Supplies should be planned for a period of about 2 years,&#13;
training will be as essential as for the other units.&#13;
Livno. Livno has no facilities at all for prosthesis production or servicing. The&#13;
decision to set up completely new workshop, including infrastructure, equipment and supplies&#13;
should be postponed until the final data from the planned screening are available. It might&#13;
be appropriate regarding future sustainability and self financing requirements to make Livno&#13;
a very small prosthesis servicing center. This small workshop could be accommodated in the&#13;
existing premisses of the hospital and much less equipment and supplies would be needed.&#13;
The technician could be trained together with colleagues in Cazin or in Mostar.&#13;

Given the emergency nature of the project, the above mentioned goods and consultant&#13;
services will be procured through accelerated procurement procedures within the framework&#13;
of the procurement guidelines and regulations of the World Bank, European Union, and other&#13;
possible participating financing agencies and donors.&#13;

            Bosnia and Herzegovina - War Victims
            Rehabilitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The ultimate objectives of the War
            Victims Rehabilitation Project are to facilitate the
            reintegration of war victims into economically productive
            activities and normal social life, and to avoid the heavy
            costs of lost productivity and sustained disruption of the
            social fabric of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Specifically, the
            project is aimed at reducing the burden of physical and
            psycho-social disabilities through targeted and
            cost-effective rehabilitation services. In pursuit of these
            objectives, the project will include the following
            components: 1) community-based rehabilitation, which will
            address the rehabilitation needs of physically injured and
            psychologically disabled war victims; 2) prostheses and
            orthoses production, which will support the production and
            maintenance of quality of prostheses and orthoses in three
            production units and five maintenance units; 3) orthopedic
            and reconstructive surgery, which will improve the
            availability and quality of essential orthopedic and
            reconstructive surgical services in three clinical centers
            and four cantonal hospitals; and 4) project implementation
            support, which will support the establishment and functions
            of a project implementation unit to manage the
            project's activities.
