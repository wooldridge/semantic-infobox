         Releaseof the SecondTrancheandPartialWaiver of One Condition&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 1.      This memorandum summarizes the progress made under the Programmatic&#13;
 Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL 3) to Turkey. The Bank&#13;
 approved the $1billion PFPSAL3 to the Republic of Turkey on June 17,2004. The Loan&#13;
 Agreement was signed on June 18, 2004 and became effective on July 1, 2004. The first&#13;
 tranche of $500 million was disbursed on July 2, 2004. The second tranche i s US$500&#13;
 million. PFPSAL 3 i s the third in a series of structural adjustment loans extended to&#13;
 Turkey following the 2001 crisis to support the Government's multiyear financial and&#13;
 public sector reformprogram.&#13;
&#13;
 2.      PFPSAL3 aimed at supporting implementationof the Government's financial and&#13;
 public sector reform priorities while ensuring that social programs remain adequately&#13;
 funded and are increasingly better targeted. Key reform priorities in the financial sector&#13;
 supported by PFPSAL3 include: (a) strengthening the regulatory framework for banking,&#13;
 (b) building institutional capacity at the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency&#13;
 (BRSA) and Saving Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF), (c) restructuring and privatizing&#13;
 state banks, and (d) improvingthe corporate insolvency regime.&#13;
&#13;
 3.     Key reform priorities in the public sector supported by PFPSAL 3 include: (a)&#13;
deepening of structural fiscal policies in support of sustainable fiscal adjustment, (b)&#13;
implementation of public expenditure management (PEM) reforms covering budget&#13;
planning and execution, financial accountability, and public liability management, and (c)&#13;
strengthening public sector governance including implementation of the national anti-&#13;
corruption strategy and preparation of civil service reform strategy.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Finally, the priorities for social spending supported by PFPSAL 3 include: (a)&#13;
adequate expenditure for health, education and social protection in the 2004 budget and&#13;
(b)better targeting of social protection.&#13;
&#13;
5.      The Government's IMF and World Bank supported economic and structural&#13;
reformprogram has delivered strong economic performance and stability in the last three&#13;
years, with average growth rate reaching 8 percent during this period and inflation&#13;
subsidingto 7.7 percent at end-2005, which representedthe lowest rate inmore than three&#13;
decades. Fiscal tightening led to an average primary surplus of about 6.5 percent in the&#13;
last three years and the overall deficit declined to below 2 percent of GNP in 2005.&#13;
Helped also by the appreciation of the Turkish lira, the net public debt to GNP ratio&#13;
declined sharply from the post-crisis peak of 91 percent in 2001 to below 56 percent in&#13;
2005. The political stability following the November 2002 elections has been&#13;
instrumental inthe recently achieved economic stability.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 6.      Key structural reforms have taken place in the last four years in important&#13;
 subjects such as public expenditure management, financial sector, privatization, social&#13;
 security and agriculture, energy and telecommunications. Notwithstanding achievements&#13;
 in many issues, progress was slower than envisaged in a few areas, most notably&#13;
 privatization of state banks. The Government requested an extension of the closing date&#13;
 of the loan, originally June 30, 2005 as there were tranche disbursement conditions still&#13;
 pending at the time. The Bank agreed to extend the closing date to December 31, 2005.&#13;
 The closing date was then further extended to June 30, 2006 upon Government's request&#13;
 to provide additionaltime neededto finalize three pending actions supported by the Loan.&#13;
&#13;
 7.      The Government has fully met 11out of 12 core conditions for the release of the&#13;
 second tranche. The one remaining condition has been partially met -- as presented in&#13;
 detail in section I11 below. The Government has requested a partial waiver for the&#13;
 condition related to privatizing state owned Ziraat Bank -- which i s the largest bank&#13;
 (private or public) inthe country ranked by assets.&#13;
&#13;
 8.      The authorities have decided that it i s advisable to first observe the results of the&#13;
privatization of Halk Bank prior to proceeding with the sale of the much larger Ziraat&#13;
Bank. Nonetheless, the Government has assumedan active shareholder role in overseeing&#13;
the functioning and restructuring of Ziraat. Its Board of Directors was re-configuredand&#13;
a senior level steering committee was established to develop and implement an extensive&#13;
operational restructuring plan (entitled "Strategic Road Map") to ready the bank for its&#13;
envisaged privatization. The authorities and Ziraat Bank have developed a time-table to&#13;
systematically un-wind the `burdens and privileges' the bank has long been obliged to&#13;
fulfill including, for example, removing the `burdens' of mandatory tax collections and&#13;
payment of public employee pensions, and similarly, the `privilege' that government&#13;
agencies mustkeep their deposit accounts inone of three state controlled banks.&#13;
&#13;
9.       The   following    sections   of  this memorandum summarize              the   recent&#13;
macroeconomic developments since 2004, the overall progress in the structural reform&#13;
program supported by PFPSAL 3 and the actions taken by the Government to meet the&#13;
specific conditions for release of the secondtranche.&#13;
&#13;
     I.RecentEconomicDevelopments&#13;
&#13;
10.      The commitment of the government to sound economic policies since 2001 and&#13;
the determined implementation of its reform program have placed the Turkish economy&#13;
in a good position to embark on a sustained path of faster economic growth. Substantial&#13;
progress has been achieved in reducing inflation and real rates of interest, improving&#13;
public finances, restructuring the financial sector, improving the business environment,&#13;
and reforming the public sector. In particular, strong fiscal discipline helped lower&#13;
inflation and inflationary expectations and improve debt sustainability. Thus, stability&#13;
has been restored, predictability has improved and market confidence has increased. The&#13;
Stand-By arrangement with the IMF, and the ongoing process of EU accession, i s&#13;
expected to provide an anchor for the continuation of the reform process in the years&#13;
ahead, and contribute to increasing Turkey's growth potential and improving&#13;
convergence to the EUaverage income level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 11.     The recovery following the 2001 crisis has been remarkable. The Turkish&#13;
 economy rebounded very strongly and has been one of the fastest growing economies in&#13;
 the world over the last four years. Annual growth averaged 7.8 percent during 2002-&#13;
 2005.     The rapid increase in real per capita income helped Turkey achieve faster&#13;
 convergence with higher income countries. Inflation came down to single digits in 2004&#13;
 for the first time in 35 years and further decelerated to 7.7 percent in 2005, greatly&#13;
 facilitating the reduction in interest rates. However, two key challenges remain, namely&#13;
 that (a) high unemployment continues to persist, at 10.3 percent in 2005 despite strong&#13;
 growth for four consecutive years and (b) the current account deficit reached 5.2 percent&#13;
 of the GNP in 2004 and widened further to 6.4 percent of GNP in 2005, inpart caused by&#13;
 higher imported energy bill due to increases in the price of oil derivatives. The 2006&#13;
 current account deficit as a percentage of GNP i s expected to be close to 7 percent.&#13;
&#13;
 12.     Resolute fiscal consolidation has been the cornerstone of the economic program.&#13;
 The public sector primary balance moved to a surplus of 7.1 percent of GNP by 2004,&#13;
 and to about 6.5 percent in 2005, from a deficit of 1.6 percent in 1999. The overall&#13;
 deficit has declined to below 2 percent of GNP. The fiscal performance showed no&#13;
 deterioration in the first three months of 2006 as the primary surplus of the consolidated&#13;
 budget amounted to 32 percent of the annual target for 2006. The net debt to GNP ratio,&#13;
 which reached a peak of 91 percent in 2001, came down to 56 percent in 2005, due to&#13;
 declining real interest rates, strong fiscal performance, the robust economic growth and&#13;
 continued appreciation of the real exchange rate.&#13;
&#13;
 13.     The GNP growth rate in 2005 reached 7.6 percent exceeding expectations for the&#13;
fourth straight year. The major contributing factors were private consumption, private&#13;
investment, and export growth. A noticeable change from the past rapid growth episodes&#13;
was that growth mainly came from the private sector, while public sector consumption&#13;
and investment expenditures were heavily constrained by tight fiscal policies. GDP per&#13;
capita at current dollars exceeded US$ 5,000 for the first time in Turkey's history, and&#13;
total GDP reached US$361.5 billion in 2005. The early signs in2006 are mixed, but the&#13;
strong investment demand bodes well for the sustainability of growth. Preliminary data&#13;
indicatethat the economy continues to grow in 2006, albeit at a slower pace. The official&#13;
estimate of 5 percent growth for the whole year seems within reach.&#13;
&#13;
14.     With increasing capital inflows and growing appetite for the Turkish government&#13;
paper, the Treasury had no problem in servicing the debt. The average maturity of new&#13;
debt increased from 15 months in 2004 and to over 27 months in 2005.                  More&#13;
encouragingly, Treasury was able to issue YTL 27.7 billion of 5-year floating rate bonds&#13;
(FRNs) in2005.&#13;
&#13;
15.     Strong growth in 2005 has been associated with increasing imports of capital and&#13;
intermediate goods. As the trade deficit further widened in 2005 (despite the moderation&#13;
inthe automobile imports) to about US$43 billion, the current account deficit hit US$23&#13;
billion, or 6.4 percent of GNP, up from 5.2 percent in 2004. The increase came as a&#13;
result of imports growth outpacing exports. On a more positive note, the contribution of&#13;
consumption goods imports declined and the increase in the capital and intermediate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 goods (of about US$17billion) was the main factor behindthe growing trade deficit. The&#13;
 hike inthe energy imports alone was a striking US$7 billion, due to surging oil prices.&#13;
&#13;
 16.     The financing of the current account deficit has not been a problem partly because&#13;
the share of long-termcapital and non-debt creating flows continues to increase. In2004,&#13;
 about 53 percent of total net inflows (excluding IMFcredits and official reserves) were in&#13;
the form of short-term flows. This share dropped to 41 percent in 2005, which i s a&#13;
healthy sign. Non-debt creating flows such as foreign direct investment (FDI), equity&#13;
flows, and net errors and omissions covered some 75 percent of the current account&#13;
deficit in 2005. Inparticular the FDIinflows (on a cash basis) reached a historical high&#13;
of US$9.7 billion (2.7 percent of GNP) in2005.&#13;
&#13;
 17.     Even though the level and the structure of Turkey's public debt has improved,&#13;
Turkey remains exposed to risks. The comparatively high level of private and public&#13;
external debt underscores the important risk of a significant depreciation in the currency.&#13;
However, there are some mitigating factors that make the economy more resilient to such&#13;
shocks. In contrast to the pre-2001 crisis period, a flexible exchange rate regime i s in&#13;
place and an independent Central Bank has established strong credibility over the past&#13;
few years, as evidenced by the shift to an explicit inflation targeting regime in January&#13;
2006. The official reserves of the CBT rose from around US$19 billion in 2001 to&#13;
US$52.4 billion in2005.&#13;
&#13;
18.      Inthe longterm, sustainability of the current account i s going to be helpedby the&#13;
following: (a) increased confidence level, mostly due to continued macroeconomic&#13;
stability and positive developments on the EU relations front, i s likely to improve the&#13;
structure of capital flows, towards more long-term financing including FDI; and (b)&#13;
continued fiscal discipline through a high primary budget surplus to ensure needed&#13;
mobilization of domestic savings for the financing of investment.&#13;
&#13;
19.      The year 2005 represents a milestone in the history of privatization in Turkey.&#13;
The Privatization Administration completed the ever biggest privatization, Turk&#13;
Telekom, in July 2005, raising US$ 6.6 billion for a sale of 55 percent shares of the&#13;
company. The total amount of privatization deals in 2005 i s expected to yield close to&#13;
US$ 26 billion (not including sales by the SDIF), although some of the sales are still in&#13;
the legal process. By comparison, only US$ 9.4 billion of privatization deals was&#13;
realized in the whole period 1986-2004.         All these developments signal a strong&#13;
confidence in the Turkish economy and confirm the government's commitment to the&#13;
privatization program. Continuing efforts of privatization will help reduce public debt&#13;
and, combined with greater green-field FDI, will be particularly helpful in financing the&#13;
widening current account deficit-especially in a context where short-term capital flows&#13;
to emerging market economies may dry up with increasing interest rates in international&#13;
capital markets. The year 2006 also looks quite promising in terms of privatization as&#13;
well. As of March 31, 2006; Turkey had implementedprivatizationtransactions for US$&#13;
7.3 billion.&#13;
&#13;
20.      The impressive economic growth did not reduce the overall unemployment rate.&#13;
Despite the strong growth performance for the four consecutive years in a row,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 unemployment remained high at 10.3 percent in 2005. In urban areas however, the&#13;
 unemployment rate declined to 12.7 percent, close to one percentage point, while the&#13;
 unemployment of youth declined by more than 2 percentage points to 22.8 percent.&#13;
 Although the rate of increase in employment in services, industry and construction&#13;
 sectors was significant, employment in the agriculture sector declined by 907,000 over&#13;
 this period. The drop in agricultural employment, which reflects a shift away from the&#13;
 agricultural sector towards finding employment in more productive sectors, was the main&#13;
 reason for the low overall net employment gain.&#13;
&#13;
 21.    Turkey's economic program i s supported by an International Monetary Fund&#13;
 (IMF)Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). InMay2005, the IMFapproved athree-year, SDR&#13;
 6.66 billion (about US$ 10 billion) SBA to support Turkey's economic and financial&#13;
 program through May 2008. The overriding goals of the new program are to create&#13;
 conditions for sustained growth that will raise living standards and reduce&#13;
 unemployment; facilitate convergence towards the EU economies; and bring about an&#13;
 orderly exit from IMF support. A combined first and second review and an amount of&#13;
 SDR 1.1billion (about US$ 1.6 billion) credit disbursement have been completed under&#13;
the new SBA. The discussions on the 3rd and 4th reviews were concluded in May 2006&#13;
with a targeted Board discussion date of July 2006.&#13;
&#13;
22.     Global volatility in the prices of equities, bonds, FOREX, and commodities since&#13;
2006 has affected all emerging markets including Turkey, where the lira depreciated by&#13;
about 17 percent with respect to the US dollar. While Turkey has not been&#13;
disproportionately affected compared to other countries, domestic developments that&#13;
occurred prior to this episode of global volatility probably magnified the effects of these&#13;
global events into local markets.&#13;
&#13;
23.     The nature and magnitude of the macroeconomic risksresulting from these recent&#13;
events will ultimately depend on the depreciation of YTL with respect to the Euro and the&#13;
U S dollar following the reestablishment of normalcy in global markets. If the current&#13;
level of depreciation in YTL sustained, it would have a negative impact on the pace of&#13;
disinflation and on public debt. However, a positive impact on price competitiveness and&#13;
exports and therefore on the current account balance would also be expected.&#13;
&#13;
24.     A comprehensive analysis of the possible effect of this recent FX volatility on key&#13;
economic variables could not be yet completed as it i s not obvious at this stage whether&#13;
the current move i s permanent or would be partially or totally reversed. However, early&#13;
estimations indicate that such effects are unlikely to be large in magnitude. Due to the&#13;
flexible exchange rate regime and a decline in currency substitution, the pass through of&#13;
YTL depreciation to inflation has declined in recent years. World Bank staff carried out&#13;
a public debt sensitivity analysis which indicates that a 10 percent permanent&#13;
depreciation in YTL would not have a major impact on the public debt stock.&#13;
&#13;
25.     A recent positive development i s that on June 7, 2006 the Monetary Policy&#13;
Committee of the Central Bank increased its key policy rate by 175 bps to 15 percent&#13;
from 13.25 percent. This action i s seen as a reaffirmation of the independence of the&#13;
Central Bank and a signal of its continuing commitment to the disinflation process. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 sharp tightening in monetary policy will dampen domestic demand and should limit the&#13;
 depreciation of the currency which means a likely easing of inflationary pressures. In&#13;
 addition, slower consumer loans and private consumption are likely to be positive for the&#13;
 current account.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    11.The StructuralAdjustmentProgram&#13;
&#13;
26.      The main objective of PFPSAL 3 was to support implementation of the&#13;
Government's financial and public sector reform priorities while ensuring that social&#13;
programs were adequately funded and increasingly better targeted. These objectives&#13;
were met, as follows.&#13;
&#13;
27.     The key reform priorities in the financial sector supported by PFPSAL 3 include:&#13;
(a) strengthening the regulatory framework for banking, (b) building institutional&#13;
capacity at the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) and Saving Deposit&#13;
Insurance Fund (SDIF), (c) restructuring and privatizing state banks, and (d) improving&#13;
the corporate insolvency regime. The key reform priorities in the public sector supported&#13;
by PFPSAL 3 included: (a) deepening of structural fiscal policies in support of&#13;
sustainable fiscal adjustment, (b) implementation of public expenditure management&#13;
(PEM) reforms covering budget planning and execution, financial accountability, and&#13;
public liability management, and (c) strengthening public sector governance including&#13;
implementation of the national anti-corruption strategy and preparation of civil service&#13;
reform strategy. The priorities for social spending supported by PFPSAL 3 included: (a)&#13;
adequate expenditures for health, education and social protection in the 2004 budget and&#13;
(b) better targeting of social protection.&#13;
&#13;
28.     The overall implementation of the PFPSAL 3 structural reform program has been&#13;
successful. The Government fully met 11 of the 12 core conditions for disbursing the&#13;
second tranche and partially met the remaining condition, as explained indetail in section&#13;
I11below. The structural reform program supported by the PFPSAL 3 has been well&#13;
implementedwith important progress inboth the banking sector and public sector reform&#13;
components. In the banking sector, several actions have been taken with the aim of&#13;
further developing the financial sector in a way that will not constitute a source of&#13;
macroeconomic risk. The main policy actions include: enactment of amendments to the&#13;
Banking Act, implementation of the BRSA Strategic Plan and SDIF Institutional&#13;
Development Plan, amendments to the Execution and Bankruptcy Act including&#13;
enactment of its implementing regulations, substantial progress towards the privatization&#13;
of Halk Bank as well as a successful Initial Public Offering for Vakif Bank.&#13;
&#13;
29.    In the public sector, implementation of the comprehensive reform agenda&#13;
continued, through the establishment of a semi-autonomous Revenue Administration&#13;
(RA), enactment of a law that eliminated earmarked revenues of the now closed extra&#13;
budgetary funds and the special appropriation mechanism, submission of a new Turkish&#13;
Court of Accounts law to the Parliament and the enactment of a Code of Conduct for civil&#13;
servants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30.      The following table presents an overview of the progress of the PFPSAL 3 in&#13;
terms of the main program areas to be monitoredfor the releaseof the second tranche.&#13;

&#13;
31.      CAS Linkage. The PFPSAL 3 i s part of a broad program of World Bank&#13;
financing in support of the Government's comprehensive reform efforts. The Bank's&#13;
overall lending program for the FY 2004-06 was approved by the Board in November&#13;
2003. In November 2005, the Board approved the extension of the CAS period by&#13;
another fiscal year under a largely unchanged strategic framework. The enhanced high&#13;
case presented in the CAS Progress Report i s in the amount of US$6.6 billion for FY&#13;
2004-07, of which US$2.6 i s inprogram lending.&#13;
&#13;
32.      The progress in meeting the conditions for release of the PFPSAL 3 second&#13;
tranche indicates that the CAS high case triggers (particularly triggers related to a&#13;
satisfactory macroeconomic framework, social expenditures and reforms in the public&#13;
sector and financial sector) are on track. The release of the second tranche of the&#13;
Economic Reform Loan in April 2004 confirms that triggers related to the sustained&#13;
implementation of regulatory reforms, privatization and liberalization of the energy and&#13;
telecommunications sectors and the agriculturalreform programhave been met. The CAS&#13;
trigger on social security reform has also been met as evidenced by the adoption of the&#13;
Social Security Administrative Law (No.5502 dated May 16, 2006) and the Social&#13;
Security and UniversalHealth Insurance Law (No. 5510dated May 31,2006).&#13;
&#13;
    111.Conditions for Releaseof the SecondTranche&#13;
&#13;
33.      For release of the second tranche, the Loan Agreement requires that:&#13;
&#13;
The Borrower has made satisfactorv progress in carrving out the Third Phase of the&#13;
Program as set forth in the Government's Letter of Development Policy dated May 20,&#13;
2004. This progress i s evidenced by the general progress in all substantive areas of the&#13;
Program, as well as by a review of the specific actions described in Schedule 3 of the&#13;
Loan Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
The macro-economic policy framework of the Borrower i s satisfactorv. The existence of&#13;
an adequate macroeconomic policy framework i s evidenced by the recent economic,&#13;

 supportedby an active IMFprogramthat remains on track.&#13;
&#13;
 The actions described in Schedule 3 of the Loan Agreement have been taken in form and&#13;
 substance satisfactory to Bank management. That these actions have been completed i s&#13;
 evidenced by the fact that 11 out of 12 conditions have been fully met and that one&#13;
 condition has been partially met in a manner satisfactory to Bank management. The&#13;
 compliance with each of these conditions i s discussed inthe following paragraphs.&#13;
&#13;
 I.MacroeconomicFramework&#13;
&#13;
         1.TheBorrower has implementeda satisfactory macro-economicframework up&#13;
         to the time of the exchange of views referred to in Section 3.01 of the Loan&#13;
         Agreement, including at least through the second quarter of calendar year&#13;
         2004, such macro-economic framework to be evaluated on the basis of the&#13;
         overall ThirdPhase of the Program and with respect to key economic variables.&#13;
&#13;
34.      This condition has been met. The Government has implemented a strong&#13;
macroeconomic framework as evidenced in the track record of key macroeconomic&#13;
outcomes and the existence of an IMFprogram. Following the successful completion of&#13;
the previous stand-by arrangement in February 2005, the Government embarked on a&#13;
new US$ 10 billion stand-by arrangement with the Fund in May 2005. The first and&#13;
second reviews under the current arrangement have been completed in December 2005.&#13;
The discussions on the third and fourth reviews were concluded in May 2006 with a&#13;
targeted IMFBoard discussion inJuly 2006.&#13;
&#13;
35.      Macroeconomic outcomes for 2004 and 2005 generally surpassed the targets and&#13;
indicators set by the program, although the current account emerged as the main source&#13;
of potential risk. Substantial progress has been achieved in reducing inflation and real&#13;
rates of interest and improving public finances. Thus, stability has been restored,&#13;
predictability has improved and market confidence has increased.&#13;
&#13;
36.      Average growth for 2002-2005 reached about 8 percent while inflation rates&#13;
declined to single digit rates (9.3 percent) in 2004 for the first time in more than 30 years&#13;
and further to 7.7 percent in 2005. Strong fiscal discipline helped lower inflation and&#13;
inflationary expectations and improve debt sustainability. The public sector primary&#13;
balance exceeded the target of 6.5 percent of GNP in 2004 and the preliminary estimates&#13;
indicate that the 2005 primary surplus was over 6 percent. The overall deficit has&#13;
declined to below 2 percent of GNP in 2005 helping Turkey meet one of the Maastricht&#13;
criteria of the EU. The net debt to GNP ratio, which reached a peak of 90 percent in&#13;
2001, came down to below 60 percent in2005. While the current account deficit widened&#13;
to 6.4 percent of GNP in 2005, from 5.2 percent in 2004, the financing of the deficit has&#13;
not been a problem partly because the share of long-term capital and non-debt creating&#13;
flows continues to increase. Non-debt creating flows such as foreign direct investment&#13;
(FDI),equity flows, and net errors and omissions covered some 75 percent of the current&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 account deficit in 2005. In particular the FDI inflows (on a cash basis) reached a&#13;
 historicalhigh of US$9.7 billion (2.7 percent of GNP) in 2005.&#13;
&#13;
 37.     As of early 2006, economic fundamentals continue to be strong as evidenced by&#13;
 the resilience exhibited by the economy to an adverse shock in mid-May 2006 caused by&#13;
 global financial volatility.&#13;
&#13;
         2. The Borrower has enacted an agriculture framework law including&#13;
         satisfactory provisionsfor direct income support.&#13;
&#13;
 38.     This condition has been met. The agricultural framework law (No.5488) was&#13;
enacted on April 25, 2006. The law and its implementing regulations are fully consistent&#13;
 with the Agriculture Strategy Paper which was approved by the HighPlanning Council in&#13;
November 2004. The Bank has supported the adoption of the Agriculture Strategy Paper&#13;
which sets out the various agriculture subsidy schemes (including Direct Income Support&#13;
to farmers) and their shares in the total amount of subsidies granted in the period 2006-&#13;
2010. While the law contains most of the substance in the Strategy, the shares of each&#13;
agriculture subsidy scheme in total subsidies were removed from the law during&#13;
Parliamentary discussions. To confirm its commitment to the allocation of the agriculture&#13;
subsidies as set out in the Strategy Paper, the Steering Committee established under the&#13;
new Law, issued implementing regulations towards this end. As a result, the subsidy&#13;
program during 2006-2010 i s in conformity with the shares determined in the Strategy&#13;
Paper, including a 45 percent share for DIS. The 2006 budget has been allocated&#13;
consistently with the Strategy.&#13;
&#13;
39.     Through the Agricultural Strategy Paper Government took the initial steps of&#13;
recasting the shape of the agricultural transfer budget to address a number of key&#13;
agricultural sector challenges and initiate programs more broadly targeted to rural&#13;
development. There are two key factors motivating this approach. First, there i s a widely&#13;
held view in the Government that the DIS Program, although serving the useful purpose&#13;
of income support for farmers (in the transition after subsidy reduction), should be better&#13;
targeted to exclude wealthier farmers. Second, there i s the view that the DIS Program&#13;
needs to be accompanied by transfer policies which aim to promote productivity and&#13;
market development more directly.&#13;
&#13;
40.     The other encouraging aspect of planned adjustments i s that 30 percent of the&#13;
transfer budget i s to be allocated to productivity enhancing measures, including (a) grants&#13;
to farmers for stimulating environmentally sustainable agricultural practices and&#13;
alternative crops to tobacco, hazelnut, and sugar; (b) investment grants awarded on a&#13;
competitive basis for agribusiness and other rural SMEs, as well as for public providers&#13;
of infrastructure and services; and (c) agricultural sector risk mitigation through partial&#13;
coverage of crop insurance premia for farmers. These areas are the main source of the&#13;
planned reduction in the share of the DIS program (from about 80 percent of total&#13;
agriculture subsidies to 45 percent, as institutionalized through the Agriculture&#13;
Framework Law and the Agriculture Strategy Paper).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

 11.FinancialSector Reform&#13;
&#13;
 A. InstitutionalDevelopmentof BRSA andSDIF&#13;
&#13;
        3. The Borrower satisfactorily has enacted amendments to the Banking Act and&#13;
        has implemented such amendments as well as the BRSA strategicplan and the&#13;
        SDIF institutionaldevelopmentstrategyplan.&#13;
&#13;
 41.    This three-part condition has been met. The Parliament passed a set of&#13;
 comprehensive amendments to the Banking Act in July 2005, which substantially&#13;
broadened and clarified BRSA's scope of responsibilities including various of its core&#13;
 competencies, such as: (a) licensing banks; (b) defining related parties; (c) establishing&#13;
new limits on the credit exposure of related parties; (d) specifying corrective measures to&#13;
be taken against bank directors; (e) establishing explicit legal protection for BRSA staff&#13;
 in the performance of their duties; and (f) expanding the legal basis of BRSA staff to&#13;
examine banks. The World Bank and other international financial institutions, most&#13;
notably the IMF, provided significant comments and technical assistance throughout the&#13;
drafting of the Banking Act. Implementation of the new Banking Act i s to be supported&#13;
by more than fifty new or amended regulations, which once fully in place later in 2006,&#13;
will enable to the BRSA to better fulfill its responsibilities as a modern financial&#13;
supervisory authority.&#13;
&#13;
42.     The World Bank offered several rounds of comments on various working drafts of&#13;
the Strategic Plan prepared by BRSA as the agency has adapted its strategies in response&#13;
to the rapidly changing environment since 2001 - including the major changes in the&#13;
agency and in the industry resulting from the enactment of the 2005 Banking Act. The&#13;
World Bank has been supportive of the aims contained inthe various versions of the plan,&#13;
which by definition must be a living document.&#13;
&#13;
43.     The current version of the plan outlines the Agency's eight main values and i s&#13;
supported by a detailed matrix of five strategic goals and a large number of underlying&#13;
separate activities and measures used to determine progress in achieving the agreed&#13;
strategic goals. Progress in implementing the plan includes the following actions among&#13;
others: the completion of implementing the organizational changes introduced by the&#13;
Banking Law and progress in preparation of supporting regulations to bring them in line&#13;
with the EUdirectives and Basle core principles (expected to be completed in November&#13;
2006). BRSA considers 2006 to be a transition year for risk based supervision and has&#13;
prepared supervisory guidelines for this purpose. The year 2006 i s also intended for&#13;
strengthening the regulatory framework for            non bank financial institutions.&#13;
Implementation of the Strategic Plan i s one of the key guiding principles for BRSA. The&#13;
BRSA senior management will update the strategic plan by taking into consideration&#13;
BRSA Board views, World Bank comments, the recently launched Financial Sector&#13;
Assessment Program(FSAP) and EUaccession negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
44.    As to the SDIF's Institutional Development Plan (IDP), the SDIF Board of&#13;
Directors approved in September 2005 an IDP for 2005 through 2007 which spells out&#13;
the Agency's vision, four strategic goals and a set of underlying strategic objectives&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 supporting the respective goals. The World Bank provided the SDIF a number of inputs&#13;
 in the development of its draft IDP. Moreover, the Agency established and resourced a&#13;
 new `Strategic Development Department' to oversee implementationof the multi-faceted&#13;
 IDP.&#13;
&#13;
 B. ExecutionandBankruptcyAct&#13;
&#13;
           4. The Borrower has satisfactorily implemented regulations to the Execution&#13;
           and BankruptcyAct.&#13;
&#13;
 45.       This condition has been met.               The Government recognizes that a better&#13;
 functioning banking sector requires a legal framework that addresses creditor rights,&#13;
 formalhnformal corporate insolvency and restructuring systems to allow for improved&#13;
 credit risk management practices. In this context, amendments to the Execution and&#13;
 Bankruptcy Act (EBA) were enacted in December 2003 to introduce pre-packaged&#13;
 options and to complement earlier amendments enacted in July 2003. The implementing&#13;
regulations of the law were issued by the Ministry of Justice in April 2004.                           The&#13;
 Government continues to effectively implement secondary regulations of the EBA law.&#13;
&#13;
 C. StateBankRestructuringandPrivatization&#13;
&#13;
          5. The Borrower, through its Council of Ministers, has adopted a satisfactory&#13;
          restructuringandprivatizationstrategyfor Halk and Ziraat and such strategy is&#13;
          beingsatisfactorily implemented.&#13;
&#13;
46.       This two-part condition has been partially met. (Waiver requested for the&#13;
second part related to Ziraat Bank). Halk Bank is the sixth largest Turkish bank by&#13;
assets. At the end of 2005, the authorities launched through a November 2005 decision&#13;
of the High Privatization Council,' an international tender to engage a financial advisor&#13;
for the sale of Halk Bank. An advisory and sale mandate was awarded to an international&#13;
consortium lead by the investment bank Goldman Sachs in April 2006. In accordance&#13;
with the contract terms, the advisor i s to outline for the shareholder in June 2006 the&#13;
different strategic options for selling Halk Bank to the private sectcr. Subsequently, the&#13;
Government i s expected to announce the decision of which specific option to be pursued.&#13;
Investor interest in Halk Bank has been high, which bodes well for the privatization&#13;
process.&#13;
&#13;
47.       With regards the waiver sought for the divestment of Ziraat Bank, the&#13;
Government's interest i s to first benefit from the lessons learned through the Halk Bank&#13;
offering before proceeding with the sale of Ziraat Bank, the largest (state or private) bank&#13;
in Turkey. In addition, the authorities are concerned about potential "cannibalizing" in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
`The HighPrivatizationCouncil was established throughthe PrivatizationLaw No.4046.The Council i s&#13;
chaired by the Prime Minister and consists of the Ministers that are relevant to economic policy and&#13;
privatization, namely the Minister of State incharge o f the Economy, the Minister of Finance, the Minister&#13;
of Transportation and the Minister of Industry and Trade. The PrivatizationAdministration acts as the&#13;
secretariat of the Council.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 the sale of both state banks by attempting to sell two of the largest banks in the country&#13;
 simultaneously while also issuingshares of Vakif Bank - another state controlled bank.&#13;
&#13;
 48.     In the interim the Government has assumed a very active shareholder role in&#13;
 overseeing Ziraat Bank. Its Board of Directors was re-configured and a senior level&#13;
 steering committee established to develop and put in place an extensive operational&#13;
 restructuring plan (entitled "Strategic Road Map") to ready the bank for its envisaged&#13;
 privatization. Further to which, Government in collaboration with Ziraat Bank has&#13;
 developed a time-table to systematically un-wind the historical `burdens and privileges'&#13;
 the bank has long been obliged to fulfill (for example, removing the `burdens' of&#13;
 mandatory tax collections and payment of public employee salaries and pensions, and&#13;
 similarly, the `privileges' such as mandatory state-enterprisedeposit requirements, etc).&#13;
&#13;
        6. TheBorrower has reviewedthe due diligencereport and, through its Council&#13;
        of Ministers, has adopted a satisfactory private sector strategy for Vakif and&#13;
        such strategy is being satisfactorily implemented.&#13;
&#13;
49.     This condition has been met. The authorities reviewed Vakif Bank's due&#13;
diligence report titled "Strategic Roadmap for Vakif Bank's Privatization" dated October&#13;
2004. The recently enacted Banking Law gave Vakif Bank legal authority to issue a new&#13;
"D" series of shares which is the only legally viable instrument to bring about private&#13;
sector control of Vakif Bank in view of its intricate ownership structure. An Initial Public&#13;
Offering of about 22 percent stake in Vakif Bank was successfully floated in the autumn&#13;
of 2005, which brought the first private sector participation into the bank's ownership&#13;
structure through a single seat on Vakif`s Board of Directors.&#13;
&#13;
50.     The Government has confirmed       its private sector strategy for Vakif Bank and&#13;
highlighted the progress in implementing this strategy. A key element of the strategy i s to&#13;
increase the value of the Bank by continued restructuring, product development and&#13;
profitability enhancement, which resulted in a recent upgrade in the ratings of Vakif Bank&#13;
by key rating agencies. The Government envisions a series of subsequent IPOs leadingto&#13;
majority private control or depending on expert advice and market conditions, a block&#13;
sale of shares to strategic investors, and i s prepared to undertake any needed legislative&#13;
changes or amendments to the Bank's articles of incorporation towards this goal. The&#13;
Government expects to fully implement the strategy within one or two years, depending&#13;
on expert advice and market conditions.&#13;
&#13;
111.PublicSectorReform&#13;
&#13;
D.StructuralFiscalPolicies&#13;
&#13;
        7. The Borrower has made satisfactory progress in the implementation of its&#13;
        medium-term strategy to improve the tax system.&#13;
&#13;
51.     This conditionhas beenmet. The Government adopted in May 2005, a law on&#13;
the establishment of the Presidency of Revenue Administration (RA). This law&#13;
restructured the General Directorate of Revenues into the Presidency of Revenue&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Administration    which has been established as a semiautonomous entity under the&#13;
Ministry of Finance. RA is structured functionally, with local tax offices directly under&#13;
 its control. The function of collecting revenues performed by the fiscal offices in the&#13;
provinces was transferred directly to the RA. Tax Office Presidencies were established in&#13;
 29 provinces thus providing a direct linkbetween the RA's central and field units.Within&#13;
the principle of separating the stages of determining revenue policies and implementation&#13;
of such policies, a separate unit to determine revenue policies was created within the&#13;
Ministry of Finance. However, the progress has been slow in setting up a large taxpayer&#13;
unit,reorganizing the new RA along functional lines and increasing control over regional&#13;
offices. Continuation of the tax administration reform, including for example the&#13;
establishment of a large tax-payer unit, i s also supported by the IMFprogram.&#13;
&#13;
52.      A medium-term strategy for improving the tax system inTurkey has been inplace&#13;
since 2000, based on a review carried out jointly with the World Bank. The overarching&#13;
objective of the strategy i s to improve the stability, transparency and equity of the tax&#13;
system through measures to minimize tax distortions, broaden the tax base and improve&#13;
the efficiency of tax administration.&#13;
&#13;
53,     Implementation of the tax strategy has progressed reasonably well. On the tax&#13;
policy side, a unified special consumption tax to consolidate a range of excise and&#13;
specific taxes into a single tax charged on a limited range of luxury goods was enacted in&#13;
June 2002. The first legislative package under the direct tax reform was submitted to&#13;
Parliament in March 2003 and enacted in April. This legislation harmonized tax rates on&#13;
income from financial investments at the declaration stage, simplified and harmonized&#13;
the system of investment incentives, reformed the system of income tax credits and&#13;
simplified taxation of corporate earnings and dividends.&#13;
&#13;
54.     The first stage of personal income tax (PIT) reform has been implemented by the&#13;
enactment of the Law reducing the number of brackets and unifying the wage schedules&#13;
in March 2006. The new PIT schedule consists of four tax brackets instead of five&#13;
brackets and the tax rates are 15, 20, 27 and 35 percent, respectively and it unifies the&#13;
wage and non-wage income. The second stage reforms will aim at broadening the tax&#13;
base and replacing the existing system of expenditure credits with a system of standard&#13;
credits. Turkey has also initiated reforms for simplifying the corporate income tax (CIT)&#13;
as well as reducing its rates. The CIT rate was reduced from 33 percent to 30 percent for&#13;
corporate income earned in 2005 and the government has announced that the rate will be&#13;
further reduced to 20 percent in 2006 with a competitiveness consideration consistent&#13;
with the developments and the trends in the European Union and OECD countries. The&#13;
related law reducing the CIT rate to 20 percent and bringing about simplifications in the&#13;
schedule has been submitted to parliament and i s expected to be enacted soon. With the&#13;
enactment of this law, the content of the exemptions and allowances in CIT will be&#13;
narrowed and investment tax allowances will be gradually phased out. In addition,&#13;
starting January 1, 2006, interest and capital gains - including on previously exempt&#13;
government securities-have     been made subject to a flat 15 percent final withholding tax,&#13;
helpingto further harmonize, simplify, and broaden the base of the income tax system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         8. The Borrower has made satisfactory progress in the implementation of its&#13;
         comprehensivepublic employmentprogram.&#13;
&#13;
 55.     This condition has been met. The comprehensive public employment program&#13;
 initiated under PFPSAL program i s part of the longer-term strategy to modernize the&#13;
 public sector, ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability and free up resources for the&#13;
 private sector and job creation. In this context, the Government continues to implement&#13;
 its quarterly public employment monitoring program. Quarterly public employment&#13;
 figures for consolidated budget agencies, SOEs, local administrations, state banks and&#13;
 social security institutions are being monitoredby a committee chaired by the Ministry of&#13;
 Finance and quarterly employment tables have been provided to the Bank since the&#13;
 initiation of the system in 2002. The latest available data for end-2005 have been&#13;
 submitted to the Bank at end-March 2006. The quality of the data reported i s being&#13;
 improved over time as indicated for example in the shift from reporting only the number&#13;
 of cadres for the permanent workers in central government agencies to reporting occupied&#13;
 cadres, starting from the secondquarter of 2005.&#13;
&#13;
56.      Notwithstanding one-off policies for hiring new staff in selected sectors when&#13;
required on public policy grounds -- as, for example, in the case of granting 22,000&#13;
temporary personnel in the health sector; employment policies have been consistently&#13;
implemented in 2004 and 2005. The cap on the number of civil servants in the&#13;
consolidated budget agencies has been maintained at 1.7 million. Employment in SOEs&#13;
continued to decline in 2005 in line with the policy of limiting replacement hiring and as&#13;
a result of privatization, especially of big SOEs like Turk Telekom. The total&#13;
employment in SOEs declined from around 320,000 at end-2004 to slightly above&#13;
246,000 at end-2005, representing a 23 percent decline. This i s consistent with the policy&#13;
of addressing the over-employment in SOEs. A government assessment of redundancies&#13;
in SOEs as of January 2002 had resulted in an overall attrition of over 59,000 between&#13;
February 2002 and mid-March 2004.&#13;
&#13;
E.PublicExpenditureManagementandFinancialAccountability&#13;
&#13;
         9. TheBorrower has enacted a satisfactory extra budgetaryfund law.&#13;
&#13;
57.      This condition has been met. As part of the economic stabilization program&#13;
initiated by the Government in 1999, and the commitment given to the Bank under the&#13;
Economic Reform Loan (ERL) and the Programmatic Financial and Public Sector&#13;
Adjustment Loan I(PFPSAL), a total of 69 budgetary and extra-budgetary funds (EBFs)&#13;
have been abolished. As a first step, a total of 27 budgetary and extra-budgetary funds&#13;
were abolished in 2000. The funds were either not operational or had lost their functions&#13;
through time and did not have any appropriation allocated since 1993. Additionally 42&#13;
other funds were abolished with legislationthat became effective inJanuary 2002.&#13;
&#13;
58.      Despite the formal closure of the funds to meet the initial objective of improved&#13;
fiscal control, transparency, accountability and comprehensiveness of the budget, the&#13;
above mentioned legislations also allowed the Government to continue collecting the&#13;
special revenues of these funds and to transfer them to the accounts of the corresponding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 agencies as special appropriations. Therefore, even though the legislation for closure had&#13;
 been enacted, in practice the ear-making system continued to be in operation for 24 funds&#13;
 out of the 69 funds closed since the beginning of 2000.&#13;
&#13;
 59.      Nonetheless, with the enactment of law no.5217 dated July 14, 2004, the&#13;
 Government eliminated the earmarked revenue and special appropriations mechanism&#13;
 system. The only exceptions to these are Ministry of Education's revenues left from the&#13;
 closed Apprenticeship and Vocational Training Fund and Universities Research Funds.&#13;
 For Universities Research Funds, special appropriation mechanisms were discontinued&#13;
 with the effectiveness of the PFMC law, as Universities became special budget&#13;
 institutions, and their special revenues became part of their budget. The Government will,&#13;
 in agreement with the Bank, undertake the special appropriation allocation for Ministry&#13;
 of Education inline with the Public FinancialManagement and Control Law.&#13;
&#13;
          10. The Borrower has submitted a satisfactory new Turkish Court of Accounts&#13;
          Law clearly defining the scope and types of audits, in conformity with the&#13;
          Public Financial Management and ControlLaw, to Parliament.&#13;
&#13;
 60.      This condition has been met. Enactment of the Public Financial Management&#13;
 and Control (PFMC) law enabled TCA to carry out audits of all budget executing&#13;
 institutions including Presidency, and removed the requirement of TCA's ex-ante&#13;
 involvement inthe budget execution, which could hinder independence and objectivity of&#13;
 an audit institution. The PFMC Law also requires TCA audit of accountability reports&#13;
prepared by line ministries.      Inorder to ensure consistency with the PFMC law and to&#13;
reform TCA inline with international best practice, a draft TCA law was submitted to the&#13;
Parliament on February 25, 2005. The draft law aims to significantly alter the existing&#13;
TCA law in several respects - it envisages extension of TCA's mandate to cover the&#13;
general government institutions (in line with the PFMC law) and the State-owned&#13;
Economic Enterprises, and to certain other bodies which use public funds. Second, the&#13;
draft law clearly defines the types of audits that TCA can carry out including financial&#13;
audits and performance audits, in addition to compliance/regularity audit. The new law,&#13;
which i s expected to be enacted as part of the Programmatic Public Sector Development&#13;
Policy Loan (PPDPL) program supported by the Bank, will have a profound impact on&#13;
the working of the TCA by enhancing the emphasis on financial and performance audit&#13;
from the current focus on compliance audits andjudicial work.&#13;
&#13;
61.      An effective supreme audit institution is an essential element for public sector&#13;
accountability. These reforms would enable TCA to become an effective supreme audit&#13;
institution and strengthen public sector accountability. The PFPSAL program has&#13;
supported external audit reforms including drafting of a new legal framework. The&#13;
proposed PPDPL program i s expected to support the full implementation of these&#13;
reforms. The TCA will continue to receive technical advice from the Bank and support&#13;
from EUa twinning project with the National Audit Office of the United Kingdom. The&#13;
twinning project i s assisting TCA in developing audit standards consistent with EU&#13;
guidelines, revamping the organization structure, and training its staff in financial and&#13;
performance audits. As part of this project, TCA will also undergo a peer review process&#13;
to be conducted by the Spanish Supreme Audit Institution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 62.     While awaiting the enactment of the new law, the TCA and its twining partner&#13;
 have begun working on the implementation plan for successfully implementing the new&#13;
 law. The Bank will play an important role in this exercise by providing technical&#13;
 assistanceand advice in preparing secondary legislation.&#13;

         11.TheBorrower has enacteda satisfactory code of conductfor civilservants.&#13;
&#13;
 63.     This condition has been met. The Law No. 5176 on the establishment of an&#13;
 Ethics Board for civil servants was enacted in June 2004. The law established the&#13;
 principles and procedures of the establishment of the Civil Servants Ethics Board and set&#13;
 out the duties of the Board as follows: (a) to determine the code of conduct for civil&#13;
 servants through regulations, (b) to investigate claims of violation of code of conduct and&#13;
 report the findings of such investigations to the relevant authorities and (c&gt;to carry out,&#13;
 commission or support studies with the aim of establishing ethical culture in the civil&#13;
 service. The members of the Board were appointed and met for the first time in&#13;
 September 2004 and the Boardhadits first meeting at the end of September 2004.&#13;
&#13;
 64.     The regulation on the Code of Conduct for civil servants was issued in April&#13;
 2005. The regulation required that, within three months after issuance, all civil servants&#13;
 covered by the law need to sign an ethics contract which i s an annex to the regulation.&#13;
 All civil servants covered by the law have signed the contract and new staff i s required to&#13;
 sign it before they start their job.    The Ethics Board i s engaged in an extensive&#13;
communications program aimed at promoting the Code of Conduct and providing&#13;
training to civil servants. In this context, the Board has been holding meetings with&#13;
media and organizing seminars and conferences in addition to publishing and distributing&#13;
widely, information on the Code of Conduct. Training i s being providedto civil servants,&#13;
and studies are underway to incorporate this training in the in-service training programs&#13;
of agencies. In addition, there i s ongoing collaboration with universities for designing a&#13;
programfor Ethics Certification, which would be aimed at certifying trainers. The Ethics&#13;
Board has received close to 80 complaints in 2005, which were investigated and&#13;
forwarded to the relevant agencies.&#13;
&#13;
         12. The Borrower has made satisfactory progress in thepreparation of a civil&#13;
         service reform strategy.&#13;
&#13;
65.      This condition has been met. The State Planning Organization finalized the&#13;
functional review of the government which was transmitted to the Bank in early June&#13;
2006. The draft functional review was prepared in 2004 and shared with the Bank in&#13;
September 2004. The study aimed at clarifying the duties and authorities of public&#13;
institutions and identifying overlaps and conflicts among them.            The government&#13;
recognizes that such conflicts among public institutions represent a major obstacle for the&#13;
efficiency and effectives of the functioning of the state. As part of the implementation&#13;
process of the recommendations of the study, the Government abolished some institutions&#13;
including for example, the General Directorate of Rural Services and the Undersecretariat&#13;
of Housing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
66.    Implementation of the Government's comprehensive agenda on public sector&#13;
reform has continued with other important actions most notably the drafting of a new law&#13;
on Public Personnel. The draft law aims at: (a) improving efficiency; (b) eliminating&#13;
discrepancies in remuneration across similar positions within the public sector; (c)&#13;
making it easier to ensure a fiscally sound wage bill; and (d) providing competitive&#13;
opportunities for entry into the public administration.&#13;
&#13;
