THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:               The Russian Federation&#13;
Beneficiary:            State Committee for Standards (GOST)&#13;
Amount:                 US$24 million equivalent&#13;
Terms:                  Seventeen years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard&#13;
variable interest rate.&#13;
Project Objectives:     The project has three objectives: (i) to support Russia's accession to the&#13;
WTO by helping it meet WTO requirements in the area of product and&#13;
process standards; (ii) to harmonize Russian standards (particularly for export&#13;
products) with international standards; and (iii) to upgrade and strengthen&#13;
Russian testing/certification capacity and institute mechanisms to facilitate&#13;
international accreditation (recognition) of Russian testing and certification&#13;
bodies, so as to increase the ability of Russian firms to receive pre-shipment&#13;
certification of their exports.&#13;
Project Description:    The project focuses on the following core activities:&#13;
(i)  The Standards Enquiry Point. GOST will create an enquiry point for&#13;
standards required by WTO, within the Russian Data Center (RDC).&#13;
Existing institutional infrastructure would be strengthened via the&#13;
upgrading and modernization of standards-related electronic data&#13;
processing and information management systems. Russian metrology&#13;
and testing centers would be networked into the RDC, enabling&#13;
users/exporters to access information on international standards. At&#13;
the international level, the RDC would interface with foreign WTO&#13;
enquiry points to remain current with foreign standards developments.&#13;
Foreign exporters to Russia would also be able to receive information&#13;
on Russian standards.&#13;
(ii)  Harmonization. To ensure that national standards are compatible with&#13;
(and ideally, identical to) international standards, the project would&#13;
support a case-by-case inspection of existing Russian standards, a&#13;
determination of whether there are any compelling reasons why the&#13;
international norm should not apply, and a redrafting, if necessary, of&#13;
the Russian standard.&#13;
(iii) Certification and Accreditation. To increase the ability of Russian&#13;
firms to receive pre-shipment certification by laboratories that have&#13;
been recognized by Russia's trading partners as conforming to&#13;
international standards, the project would enable certain Russian testing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- jj -&#13;
and certification bodies to conform with internationally accepted&#13;
norms, thus facilitating the negotiation of mutual recognition&#13;
agreements.&#13;
Rationale for&#13;
Bank Involvement:       In order for Russia to achieve a sustainable level of growth, there must be&#13;
a significant increase in exports of manufactured goods. Doing so requires&#13;
further integrating Russia into the world economy. Bank assistance would&#13;
contribute to this process by strengthening the institutional structure relating&#13;
to standards, thereby promoting the development of a strong, competitive and&#13;
export oriented manufacturing sector.&#13;
Benefits:               The project's immediate outputs would be to facilitate Russia's accession to&#13;
the WTO. Joining the WTO would make it more difficult for the imposition&#13;
on Russian exporters of quotas, discriminatory tariffs, and arbitrary&#13;
antidumping or countervailing duty actions, and guarantee nondiscriminatory&#13;
treatment and access to the WTO's dispute settlement rules. Over the longer&#13;
term, the main benefit would be the development of an export-oriented&#13;
manufacturing sector.&#13;
Risks:                  The project is subject to the risk that the conditions for accession to the WTO&#13;
will not be completed and the expected evolution of standards harmonization&#13;
and integration thus compromised. However, the authorities have given&#13;
priority to WTO accession.  The other important risks are inadequate&#13;
coordination of interdependent elements and slow or inefficient utilization of&#13;
funds due to unfamiliarity with Bank procedures concerning procurement and&#13;
disbursement. The grant-financed project preparation and implementation&#13;
consultancy services would help to reduce these risks.&#13;

STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.           There will be substantial gains for the international community by having a country of&#13;
Russia's size and economic potential participate actively in world trade. Russia is in the process of&#13;
acceding to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Russia became an observer to the WTO in 1990,&#13;
requested accession in June 1993, and presented the WTO Secretariat with a memorandum describing its&#13;
trade policies in February 1994. WTO membership will bring many benefits to Russia; it will guarantee&#13;
exporters nondiscriminatory treatment and access to the WTO's dispute settlement rules, and it will also&#13;
help the Government resist pressures for protection by making it more costly to pursue certain types of&#13;
restrictive trade policies, including in the area of standards and certification.&#13;
2.           Rapid accession to the WTO will help Russia maintain an outward looking trade stance.&#13;
WTO requirements and disciplines have implications for virtually all trade policies and implementing&#13;
agencies in Russia. Major policy areas where WTO scrutiny will occur include: (i) the extent of&#13;
centralized trade and the degree of state ownership of and intervention in the economy; (ii) the laws and&#13;
institutions governing trade, including licensing requirements and product standards; (iii) the level of&#13;
import duties and excise taxes; (iv) the administration of the customs regime and customs fonnalities; and&#13;
(v) access to service markets and the protection of intellectual property rights. The government has made&#13;
significant progress in adopting a trade policy stance that is consistent with WTO rules.' The proposed&#13;
project would also assist the Government in its efforts to accelerate accession to the WTO by helping it&#13;
satisfy WTO requirements in the area of product standards. Less progress has been made in standards-&#13;
related policies than in other areas. Implementing WTO-consistent procedures will facilitate a reduction&#13;
in the reputational problems that currently afflict Russian manufacturers.&#13;
3.           A striking characteristic of the composition of Russia's exports is that manufactured&#13;
products play only a minor role, particularly given the size of the industrial base. Many factors play a&#13;
role in explaining why manufactured exports are so low. Foremost among these are that Russian firms&#13;
have not had much, if any, experience in selling directly to foreign markets and product quality is low.&#13;
Under central planning, marketing was the responsibility of state foreign trade organizations or&#13;
alternatively, marketing was not necessary under governmentally negotiated trade agreements. Further,&#13;
Russian firms tend to be perceived as risky suppliers, either in terms of delivering on time or in terms&#13;
of delivering to specifications. Efforts to stimulate production for export must include the improvement&#13;
of the quality of Russian output--both in terms of the goods produced and the production processes used.&#13;
Existing "reputational" problems can be offset in various ways, but will clearly be a long-term process.&#13;
New technologies--both hard (equipment) and soft (management, marketing)--must be adopted.&#13;

II. INSTITUTIONAL SETTING&#13;
4.            GOSSTANDART  (GOST), the State Committee of the Russian Federation for&#13;
Standardization, Metrology and Certification is the main counterpart for the project. GOST's main&#13;
functions are outlined in Appendix I and are, briefly to: (i) be responsible for all matters relating to&#13;
WTO obligations in the standards area; (ii) provide metrology services, accredit and certify testing bodies&#13;
and act as a coordinator/registrar of standards; and (iii) write certain mandatory standards in the sphere&#13;
of social safety and consumer protection.2 GOST is best regarded as an "apex" institution; the primary&#13;
body responsible for developing and disseminating mandatory standards in Russia. Other entities beneath&#13;
the apex contributing to the development of specialized mandatory standards include Ministries, industry&#13;
associations, and special committees. A large number of testing and certification laboratories fall under&#13;
the GOST apex as well; however, many are fast becoming privatized and GOST expects to maintain only&#13;
a limited number of such bodies. Although much has been achieved towards converting GOST into a&#13;
standards body of the type found in OECD countries, much remains to be done to improve the standards-&#13;
related institutions. The institutional infrastructure has experienced real and severe cutbacks that have&#13;
slowed down the process of reorientation and modernization.&#13;
III. PROJECT RATIONALE&#13;
5.            As noted in the Country Assistance Strategy, institutional and legal reforms have been&#13;
given high priority by the Government and the Bank has encouraged the Government to target the use&#13;
of Bank funds for technical assistance to areas directly related to ongoing Bank policy and/or lending&#13;
activities. The CAS states that the Standards Development Project would improve standards certification&#13;
in connection with Russia's entry into the WTO, which complement trade policy reforms supported under&#13;
the Second Rehabilitation Loan as well as respond to the Government's stated priority for Bank&#13;
assistance in the development of nontraditional exports.&#13;
6.            In order to achieve a sustainable level of growth, there must be a significant increase in&#13;
Russia's exports of manufactured goods. Through trade, enterprises gain access to high quality&#13;
intermediate inputs and capital goods, accelerating technology transfer, and thereby allowing the quality&#13;
upgrading that must occur for manufactured exports to expand. Export orientation and greater interaction&#13;
with foreign partners will help guide enterprise reform and spearhead restructuring move generally. The&#13;
proposed project would support the improvement of the institutional framework relating to the&#13;
development, use and knowledge of standards in Russia's export sector. This would facilitate Russia's&#13;
integration into existing international cooperative networks on product and quality standards, and Russia's&#13;
accession to the WTO.&#13;
2/     GOST is not responsible for all mandatory standards. Instead, several and various other competent agencies work in&#13;
parallel. There are numerous agencies that are competent in the writing of Standards, in Russia. These include the&#13;
Ministries of Health, Transport, Agriculture, Energy, Environment, Communications, Internal Affairs, and Railways.&#13;
Other standards setting organizations include State Committees and professional/organizational industry committees.&#13;

IV. LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE&#13;
7.            Recent OED studies and reviews conclude that technology oriented projects should&#13;
emphasize development of institutions for standards, testing, technological information and technological&#13;
extension.3 Bank projects involving upgrading of standards institutions have generally focused on&#13;
industrial technological development and promotion of indigenous research and development (R&amp;D)&#13;
activities. A 1991 Technology Development Project for Turkey comes closest to the proposed project.&#13;
It aimed at improving the competitiveness of Turkish producers on export markets by encouraging the&#13;
progressive introduction of ISO 9000 quality certification. This is increasingly a necessary condition for&#13;
exporting to industrial economies.&#13;
8.            Standards play an important role in industrial development facilitating production for&#13;
export by ensuring compatibility and quality. Experience in many developing countries has demonstrated&#13;
the beneficial role of strong standards-related institutions. Outward oriented development strategies&#13;
involving the production of technologically complex goods and products subject to health or safety&#13;
standards in export markets require the availability of appropriate information sources and testing and&#13;
certification entities.&#13;
V. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
9.            The project has three objectives:&#13;
(i)  support Russia's accession to the WTO by helping it to meet WTO requirements in the&#13;
area of product and process standards. This includes the establishment of an enquiry&#13;
point for standards (see Appendix II);&#13;
(ii)   harmonize Russian standards with international standards particularly for export products;&#13;
and&#13;
(iii)   upgrade and strengthen Russian testing/certification capacity and institute mechanisms to&#13;
facilitate international accreditation (recognition) of Russian testing and certification&#13;
bodies, so as to increase the ability of Russian firms to receive pre-shipment certification&#13;
of their exports.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
10.           The project focuses on core institution building activities that include the financing of&#13;
equipment and technical assistance.  The four components are:  (i) The Standards Enquiry Point;&#13;
(ii) Standards Harmonization; (iii) Certification and Accreditation; and (iv) a Project Preparation and&#13;

Implementation Unit (PPIU). The project development indicators are outlined in Appendix III. As this&#13;
is an institution building TA project the benchmarks are largely qualitative in nature.&#13;
The Standards Enquiry Point (US$14.4 million of baseline costs)&#13;
11.           Consistent with WTO requirements, a standards enquiry point would be established within&#13;
GOST. More specifically, the Russian Data Center (RDC) within GOST's Institute for Marketing and&#13;
Research has been designated to be responsible for the enquiry point. The RDC would be responsible&#13;
for collecting all mandatory standards applied within Russia, and for their dissemination to foreign firms&#13;
and standards-setting bodies. The RDC would also function as a depository of foreign standards, and&#13;
provide information on such standards to domestic firms upon request. GOST intends the RDC to be in&#13;
communication with standards-setting Russian bodies as well as international ones.  In terms of&#13;
organization, the RDC is envisioned to be the hub of a telecommunications network linking standards&#13;
bodies, allowing it to help fulfill GOST's standards compliance and coordination responsibilities&#13;
(Appendix IV). The project is primarily financing computer systems, including a large network and&#13;
document database server system (incorporating document scanners, optical storage and extensive&#13;
document database management and communications software). Network access for local exporters will&#13;
require no more than a personal computer and modem to connect to the nearest regional system for access&#13;
to the entire network. Access to Russian standards information from abroad will be addressed by&#13;
interconnection with the international Internet network, using the facilities of the World Wide Web&#13;
(WWW) and readily available document browvser software.&#13;
Harmonization (US$6.4 million of baseline costs)&#13;
12.           Harmonization will involve a joint effort by Russian and foreign experts to conduct a&#13;
case-by-case inspection of existing standards, compare them with the equivalent international standard,&#13;
determine whether there are any compelling reasons why the international norm should not apply, and&#13;
if not, redrafting of the Russian standard.  The proposed loan would finance specific studies to:&#13;
(i) identify nonconforming standards; (ii) determine their continuing validity; (iii) assess the extent of&#13;
their divergence from international standards; (iv) evaluate, jointly with Russian bodies, the nature of any&#13;
constraints to modifications and assess whether there are any compelling technical reasons why they&#13;
should not be modified; and (v) rewrite, i.e., harmonize the Russian standards. Research would also be&#13;
conducted to identify areas where there are no standards in Russia, but international norms apply to&#13;
exported goods. In these cases, studies would be conducted to incorporate the international norm into&#13;
the body of Russian standards.&#13;
Certification and Accreditation (US$9.9 million of baseline costs)&#13;
13.           Russian exports will be facilitated if products and/or production processes can be tested&#13;
and certified in Russia before incurring shipping costs. A necessary condition for certification is that&#13;
Russian firms satisfy the health, safety and environmental standards that are applied in foreign markets.&#13;
This requires that Russian laboratories are able to certify that this is the case, and are recognized by their&#13;
counterparts and trading partners. Certification of production processes may be a necessary condition&#13;
for successfully obtaining export contracts. Obtaining certification on the basis of an international series&#13;
of quality standards, such as ISO 9000, will be particularly useful in terms of helping Russian enterprises&#13;
overcome a perceived "quality deficiency" problem in foreign markets. In part, certification and quality&#13;
control procedures can be obtained from bodies that are accredited and recognized by foreign customs&#13;
and standards bodies such as DIN (Germany), BSI (United Kingdom), or AFNOR (France), as there are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Techlnical Annex&#13;
Russia: Standards Development Project                                                       Page 5&#13;
no formal barriers to entry facing foreign specialized testing and certification bodies that seek to establish&#13;
laboratories in Russia. Indeed, recognizing the importance of intermediation by agencies, such as Societe&#13;
Generale de Surveillance (SGS) or Bureau Veritas, GOST is particularly interested in attracting foreign&#13;
firms to certify Russian products for export markets.&#13;
14.            International recognition requires that: (i) at the level of metrology, primary level&#13;
certification labs are up to par, and recognized to be so by international counterparts, and (ii) that at the&#13;
level of product testing, relevant testing bodies are accredited by recognized primary level certification&#13;
bodies. The project would enable Russian testing and certification bodies to conform with the norms that&#13;
have been established in international agencies, such as the International Standards Organization (ISO),&#13;
the International Electro-Technical Commission (IEC), and the UN Economic Commission for Europe&#13;
(ECE) for certification systems. Affected testing and metrology products include tractors, other transport&#13;
equipment, and electrical and electronic machinery. Once testing and metrology equipment has been&#13;
installed and Russian personnel of the various testing bodies have been trained, the project would support&#13;
their accreditation by representatives of the relevant international accreditation systems (IEC, OECD,&#13;
ECE, and Lloyd's). To a large extent, the negotiating of mutual recognition agreements is a confidence-&#13;
building exercise, involving the exchange of personnel and active participation in international and&#13;
regional certification bodies, supplemented by investment in the necessary testing equipment for&#13;
certification entities and metrology labs. As Russian accreditation bodies approach conformity with&#13;
international standards and gain accreditation under the relevant systems, the potential for achieving&#13;
comprehensive, mutually acceptable recognition agreements of testing laboratories would be significantly&#13;
enhanced.&#13;
15.           The project would finance equipment for testing centers including integrated gas&#13;
analyzers, smoke density indicators, sound and vibration measurement instruments, engine capacity test&#13;
beds and crash testing equipment. Also supported would be expenditures to finance an exchange program&#13;
of Russian and foreign experts to promote mutual exchange of information and recognition, overseas&#13;
training of test engineers and certification personnel in counterpart OECD environments, and study tours&#13;
at WTO enquiry points. Within Russia, the project would deliver important standards-related training,&#13;
using a "train the trainers" approach, to improve and up-date accreditation training in the accreditation&#13;
centers. It is proposed that research studies be conducted, employing Russian experts on accreditation&#13;
and certification, and that information on the latest product and manufacturing process standards be&#13;
disseminated to Russian exporters and foreign exporters to Russia.  Publicity efforts regarding&#13;
certification and accreditation supported by the project include the production of a periodical journal and&#13;
the establishment of a Federal Information center within GOST.&#13;
Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (PPIU) (US$1.3 million of baseline costs)&#13;
16.           The PPIU is responsible for project administration and implementation management for&#13;
GOST. The project's manager and finance officer are in place and will have responsibility for overall&#13;
project implementation.   PPIU  staff will include resident or contract experts in procurement,&#13;
disbursements, and accounting and auditing. Technical assistance oversight is being provided by a Project&#13;
Advisor who would be directly responsible for training a counterpart project manager along with other&#13;
project support staff. The PPIU will also employ translation and interpretation services to facilitate the&#13;
delivery of technical assistance. Technical assistance would be provided for a period of approximately&#13;
one year under a grant from the Government of Canada for the transfer of project management skills to&#13;
counterpart staff, including the development of proper project implementation procedures and the&#13;
maintenance of project accounts for external and Bank auditing purposes. The PPIU will commence&#13;
&#13;

operation with the assistance of a Project Preparation Facility of the amount of US$400,000.&#13;
Appendix V provides a detailed description of the PPIU.&#13;
C. Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
17.           Training will be provided in each of the three areas targeted by the project. For the&#13;
enquiry point, staff of the RDC will be provided with training in operations and systems management in&#13;
other WTO enquiry points and by foreign experts in Russia (TA for institutional development). The&#13;
provider of computer and telecommunications equipment will be responsible for installation-related&#13;
support training. Russian personnel of the sites that will be linked to the RDC network will be trained&#13;
in Moscow in the use of the system. For harmonization, training will be provided to personnel involved&#13;
in standardization activities with a view to accelerate harmonization of Russian standards with&#13;
international norms. This will comprise a 'train the trainer' activity, the goal being to develop skills that&#13;
can be passed on to the staff of institutes and standards-writing bodies. Engineers of testing labs and&#13;
entities that will be provided testing and metrology equipment under the project will also be provided with&#13;
training, both in Russia and overseas, in certification, testing and accreditation procedures (TA for&#13;
institutional development), to make them current with international procedures. Technical assistance (TA)&#13;
to support the training of project management and implementation skills (project support TA) will be&#13;
provided by the Resident mission (for project accounts and disbursement operations) and by the&#13;
Government of Canada in the form of a project implementation specialist who will be available to assist&#13;
the director of the PPIU for the first year or so.&#13;

D. Project Costs&#13;
18.           The total project cost is estimated at about US$34 million equivalent, including&#13;
contingencies amounting to US$2.0 million which represents about 6 percent of base costs. Project costs&#13;
include the provision of technical assistance (both foreign and local) and training and study tours in WTO&#13;
member country enquiry points; training initiatives to standardize export certification, including an active&#13;
information dissemination program; measures to promote access to international information databases&#13;
to ensure compatibility with WTO standards; telecommunications and computer equipment, training&#13;
materials and software to create the RDC network to metrology centers and standard writing bodies; and&#13;
minor refurbishing and furnishing of facilities in the process of being updated during project&#13;
implementation. The estimated costs by component and by category of expenditure are shown below&#13;
(Tables 2 and 3), and are further detailed in Appendix VI.&#13;

Basis of Cost Estimates&#13;
19.    Project costs were estimated as follows:&#13;
(i)    Base Costs. All project costs are based on January 1995 prices converted to US dollars.&#13;
Technical assistance costs are derived from recent fees quoted for comparative specialized&#13;
services in Bank-financed projects in Russia and are estimated per person month at&#13;
US$20,000 for external specialist services, US$2,800 for local specialist services, and&#13;
US$6,000 for overseas study tours. The person month costs of TA include fees,&#13;
recruitment/relocation costs, housing and subsistence, and overheads. Equipment unit&#13;
costs are based on recent quotations from suppliers of equipment and software; staff unit&#13;
costs are based on current competitive rates for local staff in the private sector.&#13;
(ii)    Contingency allowances. Contingencies for domestic price increases are projected at&#13;
rates of 298 percent for 1995; 16.3 percent for 1996; and 3.8 percent for 1997.4&#13;
International inflation rates are included at 2.0 percent, 1.6 percent and 2.1 percent,&#13;
respectively, for 1995, 1996 and 1997.5 Physical contingency allowances are included&#13;
at 5 percent of equipment costs and 10 percent of costs for civil works and recurrent&#13;
operating costs. Price and physical contingencies account for 6 percent of project&#13;
baseline costs (US$2 million).&#13;
(iii)   Foreign Exchange Component.  The foreign exchange component was estimated as&#13;
follows: (i) expert services and overseas training - 100 percent; and (ii) equipment - 100&#13;
percent (less import duty) for equipment purchased on the international market and 80&#13;
percent (less domestic taxes) for equipment purchased locally. Total project costs are&#13;
US$33.8 million of which the foreign exchange component is US$24.0 million.&#13;
(iv)   Local Costs, Taxes and Duties. Project costs include a local cost component (including&#13;
taxes) of US$10 million equivalent, which is 29 percent of total project costs. Of this,&#13;
the Bank is financing US$0.7 million; GOST US$4 million. Bank local financing is for&#13;
"off the shelf" office equipment, and local marketing/publicity activities. Taxes amount&#13;
to 15 percent of total project costs and are estimated at US$5 million of total costs.&#13;
Taxes will be financed by the Government.&#13;
(v)    Recurrent Costs. GOST-financed operating costs are estimated at US$3.4 million of base&#13;
costs, and include cost elements that relate to facilities expenses at 3 locations - the RDC&#13;
in Moscow, 125 regional Metrology Centers and several Standards Institutes and&#13;
Ministries. The Bank will finance a small amount of incremental systems operating costs&#13;
during the implementation period (start up network and telecommunication charges).&#13;

VI. PROJECT FINANCING&#13;
20.           Loan. The proposed Bank loan of US$24 million would finance 71 percent of total&#13;
project costs. Of this, US$23.2 million would finance 97 percent of the foreign exchange requirements&#13;
of the project, and US$0.8 million would finance almost 18 percent of the local costs of the project. The&#13;
local cost component would support the purchase of off-the-shelf equipment (excluding taxes) and limited&#13;
civil works activities.&#13;
21.          Local/Borrower Contribution. The share of financing assumed by GOST would support&#13;
the local cost element involved in the employment of resources to implement relevant project components:&#13;
20 percent of the local cost of publicity and marketing of certification and accreditation activities; 20&#13;
percent of the cost of procuring off-the-shelf office equipment including furniture; 20 percent of the cost&#13;
of implementing civil works activities; and 100 percent of all recurrent costs. As illustrated in Table 4&#13;
below, the total local cost contribution by GOST would be the Ruble equivalent of US$4.2 million.&#13;

22.           Grant Financing. The Government of Canada is proposing a grant contribution of&#13;
US$800,000 equivalent to finance the costs associated with the transfer of technical assistance to manage&#13;
project implementation, and provide training related to standardization.&#13;

VII. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Project Management&#13;
23.          Project Management and Implementing Agency. The Government of the Russian&#13;
Federation, the Borrower, has designated GOST to be the project management and implementing agency.&#13;
GOST would be the focal point for liaison with the Bank, and would represent the borrower in this&#13;
capacity. GOST would bear primary responsibility for managing the oversight of the establishment and&#13;
functioning of a WTO-consistent enquiry point, including technical assistance requirements that would&#13;
be provided for the training of enquiry point personnel in standards and product specifications. Personnel&#13;
of testing/certification bodies would be trained in certification procedures during the course of expanding&#13;
the capability of certification centers in Russia. Users of the enquiry point, including units with network&#13;
access, would need to be incorporated into the system of information dissemination. The project would&#13;
support publicity, marketing and outreach facilitation activities toward this end.&#13;
24.          ProjectPreparationand Implementation Unit. Project administration and implementation&#13;
support is the responsibility of a Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (PPIU) which reports to&#13;
GOST. As agreed, the PPIU was established by GOST prior to loan negotiations (August 9). So far the&#13;
PPIU includes a Russian Project Director, foreign operations expert(s), and some Russian counterpart&#13;
staff. When fully staffed the PPIU will comprise a Project Director, a Finance Officer, a Training&#13;
Manager, administrative staff (including interpreters/translators). The PPIU will contract technical&#13;
assistance services such as procurement, auditing and information technology. The project would employ&#13;
foreign and local/specialists to train PPIU staff in project management skills, with the objective of making&#13;
them capable of oversight of ongoing project operations and implementation review. PPIU professional&#13;
and administrative staff would be trained to maintain records, oversee requests for disbursements and&#13;
liaise with the Bank during implementation. The PPIU would be financed in part by the loan and by&#13;
Government resources; a grant from the Canadian government will finance Canadian consulting services&#13;
designed to support the PPIU. The loan would finance project management expertise and specialists in&#13;
data systems management, training services and project implementation planning and scheduling. The&#13;
PPIU will commence operations with the assistance of a Project Preparation Facility of the amount of&#13;
US$400,000. The PPF would initiate limited implementation activities focussing primarily on preparatory&#13;
work and detailed design development.&#13;
25.           The PPIU, created to administer the project on behalf of GOST and the Government, will&#13;
be responsible for daily direction and coordination of project implementation and assisting the Data&#13;
Center, Certification units and other participants, with implementation requirements. The PPIU will have&#13;
the legal authority to enter into implementation contracts. It will also be responsible for administering&#13;
funding flows, monitoring progress under the components, and reporting to the Government, World Bank&#13;
and other donors, as appropriate, on management issues and overall implementation progress.&#13;
26.          The PPIU will operate at full capacity for about two years during project start up and&#13;
initial implementation, and will then be scaled back in phases to a smaller staff needed for oversight,&#13;
accounting and residual reporting for the remaining implementation period. PPIU staff would be trained&#13;
and/or assisted by specialists and consultants under contract (e.g., procurement, audit, ISO&#13;
systems/information technology). As major project elements are completed, PPIU functions will be&#13;
absorbed into relevant divisions of GOST, completing the project's parallel objectives of&#13;
institutionalization.&#13;

initiated to further Russia's efforts to upgrade its standards institutions. Upon the completion of&#13;
procurement, delivery and installation of equipment, the project would begin training activities, both&#13;
domestic and overseas, while simultaneously initiating the development of the RDC's network structure&#13;
and access capabilities. Other simultaneous and supporting implementation would focus on dissemination&#13;
and marketing of standards-related information to exporters and interested foreign parties. The RDC's&#13;
network would be set up initially on a pilot basis. Modifications would be incorporated and the system&#13;
made accessible to all users when fully operational. A summary of project implementation is in Table&#13;
5. Details are presented in Appendix VII.&#13;

VIII. PROCUREMENT&#13;
General&#13;
29.             Procurement will be the responsibility of the Project Preparation and Implementation Unit&#13;
in GOST, assisted by an experienced procurement services firm. All Bank-financed goods and consulting&#13;
services required for the Project will be procured, respectively, in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines&#13;
for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January, 1995), and Use of Consultants by World&#13;
Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency (August, 1981). Procurement actions will be&#13;
carried out using the Bank's standard bidding and contracting documentation, as required by the Bank.&#13;
Prior Bank reviews of procurement procedures, terms of reference, invitations and bidding&#13;
documentation, evaluations and contracting actions will be effected where indicated by the Guidelines and&#13;
procurement thresholds discussed below. Procurement expertise will be provided to GOST from the&#13;
beginning of implementation activities by an approved Advisor and/or procurement services firm,&#13;
experienced in administering World Bank-financed purchases.  The Bank's standard bidding and&#13;
contracting documentation, as appropriate, will be used for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and&#13;
for engaging consultants and (minor) works services.   Bank-approved procedures will be used for&#13;
(minor) rehabilitation works -- to prepare computer facilities for the new equipment -- and test center&#13;
upgrades, as needed. Documentation developed by the Region will be used for these (minor) works&#13;
procurements. International Shopping (IS) and Local Shopping (LS) procurements will use commercial&#13;
documentation that will be adequate for later review and audit purposes. Additional details on expected&#13;
procurement actions and procurement plan are provided in Appendix VIII. A summary of procurement&#13;
categories and procurement methods is shown in Table 6.&#13;

Procurement of Goods&#13;
30.              Procurement of goods  will primarily  involve  computer  hardware  and  software;&#13;
teleconmmunications gear; databases; printing, reproduction and office equipment; and some minor&#13;
facilities renovations to accommodate the new systems. Wherever practicable, goods will be aggregated&#13;
to minimize procurement administration and reduce cost. Procurement actions are expected to be&#13;
undertaken within the following categories:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Russia: Standards Development Project                                              Page 15&#13;
ICB Procurement&#13;
31.          International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procurement procedures will be conducted in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated&#13;
Januarv, 1995.  ICB will be used for all purchases which are expected to exceed US$300,000 per&#13;
contract. This will cover the bulk of the Data Center and extended satellite systems computers and&#13;
operating software, telecommunications, and test center equipment. Of the total of approximately&#13;
US$20.2 million (US$15.4 million in loan funds) allocated for the purchase of necessary equipment (e.g.,&#13;
computer/information technology, testing instruments, printers and copiers, office equipment), US$18.8&#13;
million (US$14.1 million in loan funds) or about 92 percent will be procured using ICB procedures. In&#13;
the comparison of bids for equipment purchased under ICB, Russian manufacturers would be allowed&#13;
a preferential margin over the competing price of imports, as per Bank Guidelines. The project is&#13;
expected to have five ICB purchases, averaging approximately US$3.8 million per contract. The Bank&#13;
will review and clear ICB procedures, bidding documents, evaluations and resulting contracts on an ex-&#13;
ante basis; and otherwise review and provide "No-Objections", as provided for in the Guidelines.&#13;
Because computer equipment and software purchases are expected to involve improving technologies and&#13;
declining industry prices, some ICB purchases are expected to be spread over a period that is consistent&#13;
with expected regional and local offices' development and installation schedules.  Computer and&#13;
telecommunications equipment suppliers would have to demonstrate a capacity, at least by the time of&#13;
tendering, to successfully supply, install and maintain the equipment purchased. The Bank's newly&#13;
developed IT documentation and bidding procedures will be used for these latter procurements.&#13;
Direct Contracting&#13;
32.          Direct Contracting (DC), as outlined  in the Bank's Guidelines, is expected to be&#13;
employed in the procurement of proprietary database components to make the Russian Data Center&#13;
compatible with the WTO's international standards system. Proprietary database procurement is expected&#13;
to involve one contract and about US$610,000 in Loan funds. Spare parts for equipment and netware&#13;
elements may also be appropriate for DC purchases. As required by the Guidelines, Direct Contracting&#13;
actions will be justified and all documentation, awards and 'ontracting actions will be subject to prior&#13;
Bank review and clearance.&#13;
International Shopping&#13;
33.          International Shopping (IS) may be authorized for readily available, off-the-shelf&#13;
purchases under US$300,000 per contract. International Shopping will be based on quotations from at&#13;
least three suppliers, from at least two different Bank-member countries, as indicated in the Guidelines.&#13;
International Shopping is expected to total about US$540,000 (US$410,000 in Loan funds) and involve&#13;
three purchases averaging about US$180,000 each. Bank reviews of IS actions will be conducted on an&#13;
ex-post basis during supervision missions or procurement reviews.&#13;
National Competitive Bidding&#13;
34.          Because they would not be attractive to foreign suppliers, some (minor) ministry, institute&#13;
and test center computer room improvements that will be less than US$300,000 per contract will be&#13;
carried out using National Competitive Bidding (NCB), as provided for in the Bank's Guidelines. These&#13;
basic NCB procedures and procurement documentation would be submitted to the Bank for review and&#13;
approval prior to implementation.  The three expected NCB actions are expected to total about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Russia: Standards Development Project                                            Page 16&#13;
US$446,000 and average about US$148,000 per purchase.   The Region's standard bidding&#13;
documentation, dated July, 1994 for works will be used for works procurements that are over&#13;
US$250,000. Works contracts under US$250,000 each will use the ECA Region NCB documentation,&#13;
dated June 1994. At the option of the Government, the procedures may include payments in local&#13;
currency, publications and documentation in the local language, and local procedures for settlement of&#13;
disputes.   There are expected to be five or six small-value, local area network installations,&#13;
refurbishment and utility improvement contracts (for the PPIU and some test centers) that would be&#13;
undertaken using Local Shopping procedures. These transactions would average about US$40,000 each&#13;
in loan funds. To avoid inefficiencies in the administration of these latter small-value works activities,&#13;
procurement would follow a simpler, more streamlined NCB procedure. These minor works contracts&#13;
would be based on lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded after comparison of at least three bids from&#13;
qualified contractors, a procurement option that was a feature of Local Shopping in the former&#13;
Guidelines. In any event, these procedures will include the Region's standard (minor) works&#13;
documentation dated June 1994 (for contracts under US$250,000). The first two works contracts and,&#13;
if any, works contracts over US$250,000 each would be subject to prior Bank review and approval. All&#13;
other works contracts would be subject to ex post review.&#13;
National Shopping&#13;
35.          To support regional and local office computer, telecommunications and database&#13;
installations, it is expected that GOST and the PPIU will need to initiate a few small value equipment&#13;
purchases using National Shopping (NS) techniques, as described in the Guidelines. NS purchases will&#13;
complement GOST-financed office upgrades and are expected to cover contracts under US$50,000 each.&#13;
These purchases will be used for small value transactions for simple works and readily available, off-the-&#13;
shelf items. National Shopping procedures will also be used for minor purchases of office supplies,&#13;
equipment services and consumables. NS procedures will be carried out by obtaining at least three price&#13;
quotations from different eligible suppliers.  Such purchases are expected to number about nine&#13;
transactions, averaging about US$32,000 each, and total about US$235,000. Small value purchases will&#13;
be subject ex-post documentation reviews, with payments probably being effected by Special Account and&#13;
Statement of Expenditure.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
36.          A total of about US$9.0 million (US$8.5 million in loan funds) is allocated for the&#13;
procurement of technical and training services to assist GOST with project management and the planning,&#13;
development and administration of the standards improvement and dissemination program. GOST is&#13;
expected to need technical expertise for the development of: computer systems, harmonizing standards,&#13;
training testing and certification personnel, developing the standards enquiry point within the Russian&#13;
Data Center and organizing and implementing the project's oversight, procurement and audit functions.&#13;
There will also be a need for expatriate assistance in EDP work and developing policy and legislative&#13;
papers for national standards implementation.  Consultant services would be procured under contracts&#13;
awarded to firms or individuals whose qualifications, experience, and terms and conditions of employment&#13;
are satisfactory to the Bank. The participation of local consulting firms and personnel will be encouraged&#13;
to develop the domestic consulting industry. Bank-financed consulting services will be procured in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World&#13;
Bank as Executing Agency, published in August, 1981. The Bank's standard bidding and contract&#13;
documentation will be used. Solicitation methods and Terms of Reference for all consultant assignments,&#13;
and all procurement documentation and contracts with consulting firms valued at greater than US$100,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Russia: Standards Development Project                                            Page 17&#13;
will be subject to prior Bank review and approval. Prior Bank review and approval will also be required&#13;
for short lists and contracts with individuals that are expected to exceed US$50,000 each. There will be&#13;
about a dozen technical assistance and consulting contracts with firms, totaling approximately US$8.5&#13;
million (US$7.2 million in loan funds and averaging about US$675,000 each), that will be over&#13;
US$100,000 and subject to prior Bank review and approval. Contracts with individuals over US$50,000&#13;
are expected to be three in number, average about US$100,000 and total about US$300,000. The other&#13;
expected consulting contracts with firms (five each), averaging about US$65,000 each, and seven&#13;
contracts with individuals, averaging about US$23,000 each, (and together totaling about US$490,000)&#13;
will be subject to ex-post reviews on a selective basis during supervision missions and/or as part of&#13;
periodic procurement implementation reviews. Where practicable, technical assistance, such as database&#13;
development and/or standards harmonization services will be sought in consolidated packages to improve&#13;
accountability and reduce costs and administrative burdens.&#13;
Procurement Supervision&#13;
37.          In summary, ICB and DC purchases of computers, testing and telecommunications&#13;
equipment and software will be subject to prior Bank reviews and "No-Objections", as provided for in&#13;
the Guidelines. The first two works contracts under NCB and those over US$200,000 will also be subject&#13;
to prior review. Procurement of consulting services will be subject to prior Bank reviews for all TORs,&#13;
and for procedures, documentation and contracting with firms over US$100,000 and with individuals over&#13;
US$50,000. Procurements of goods and services will use the Bank's standard bidding and contracting&#13;
documents, modified or supplemented as necessary, with Bank prior approval. This procurement plan&#13;
will result in the Bank's prior reviews of approximately 92 percent of total Bank funds committed for&#13;
materials and equipment.  Besides reviewing TORs, Bank reviews of contracting actions for standards&#13;
development and harmonization and training services will cover an estimated 93 percent of total Bank&#13;
funding for technical assistance inputs. In addition, Bank staff will monitor procurement activities,&#13;
contract administration and project record keeping during supervision missions.&#13;
Docunentation Processing and Reporting&#13;
38.          An advisor and/or procurement services firm will be engaged by GOST during the PPIU&#13;
formulation phase to develop procurement plans, develop typical documentation packages and establish&#13;
procurement procedures. These specialists will help prepare documentation and, via consultations and site&#13;
visits, guide program participants in procurement planning, bid packages, solicitations, evaluations,&#13;
contracting and periodic procurement reporting requirements. These procurement specialists will also&#13;
help coordinate documentation flows needed to secure the World Bank's clearances and "No-Objections"&#13;
on consultants' TORs and equipment packages needing prior Bank review. With their help, GOST will&#13;
have records of and include information on project procurement activities in periodic reports to the Bank.&#13;
IX. DISBURSEMENTS, ACCOUNTS AND AUDITING&#13;
39.          The proceeds of the loan are expected to be fully disbursed over a 48 month period, with&#13;
most of the disbursement occurring between the fourth through the seventh semesters of the disbursement&#13;
period. The estimated disbursement schedule is shown in Table 7.&#13;

Documentation&#13;
40.            Disbursements would be fully documented except that Statements of Expenditure (SOEs)&#13;
will be used for: expenditures under contracts of goods valued at less than US$300,000; expenditures&#13;
under contracts of individual consultants valued at less than US$50,000 expenditures under contracts of&#13;
consultants' firms valued at less than US$100,000; and expenditures under contracts for civil works&#13;
valued at less than US$200,000. All pertinent documentation and records with regard to disbursement&#13;
would be retained by GOST for at least one year after project completion. In addition, documentation&#13;
should be kept until project completion to allow for recovery of the special account. Documentation&#13;
would be made available for review by the auditors and by Bank staff on request.&#13;
The Special Account&#13;
41.            To facilitate payments of small amounts and payment in local currency, the Government&#13;
would establish a Special Account denominated in US dollars in a commercial bank acceptable to the&#13;
IBRD. The selection process and qualifications of the chosen bank would be governed by specific&#13;
processes and criteria, described below. The maximum authorized allocation would be US$800,000.&#13;
The initial deposit into the account at project start will be US$100,000; this amount will be increased&#13;
after the first year of disbursement or when the Loan has reached US$1 million. All requests for&#13;
replenishment would be supported by documentation as described in para 6.31 of the Disbursement&#13;
Handbook. GOST, as implementing agency, would be responsible for reconciliation of project accounts&#13;
with disbursements and replenishment requests, and would forward these as supporting documents with&#13;
each application for replenishment.&#13;
&#13;

42.           The commercial bank holding the Special Account would be chosen on the basis of open&#13;
competitive bidding, and would, as a pre condition, be required to meet the following eligibility criteria:&#13;
(i)   it should be financially sound as demonstrated by their latest accounts which would be&#13;
audited by an internationally recognized audit firm;&#13;
(ii)    have significant foreign correspondence banking in all major currencies;&#13;
(iii)   have some experience, or at least the capacity to acquire experience, in issuing letters of&#13;
credit, transacting direct foreign payments;&#13;
(iv)   provide a wide range of local banking services, including cash payments, domestic&#13;
transfers, issuance of debit notes, and capacity to maintain several accounts for the&#13;
Special Account;&#13;
(v)    be a member of SWIFT, or plan to use the facility to expedite payments;&#13;
(vi)   be willing and able to issue a Comfort Letter to assure that amounts deposited in the&#13;
Special Account would not be set off, seized or otherwise attached to satisfy amounts&#13;
due to the commercial bank by the Borrower;&#13;
(vii)  be willing and able to adequately maintain accounts as required by IBRD, including&#13;
regular statements, and any other information that may be considered necessary;&#13;
(viii)  charge competitive rates for services and other transactions fees.&#13;
Project Accounts and Audits&#13;
43.           The PPIU would maintain a single set of project accounts for GOST, including the Special&#13;
Account. These records would be audited in accordance with the "Guidelines for Financial Reporting&#13;
and Auditing of Projects and disbursements under SOEs, financed by the World Bank" (March 1982).&#13;
The Borrower would provide, within six months of the end of each Government fiscal year, an audit&#13;
report of such scope and detail as the IBRD may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an&#13;
independent auditor acceptable to the IBRD, on disbursements against SOEs. The separate opinion should&#13;
mention whether SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and controls&#13;
involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawal applications.&#13;
Bank Supervision&#13;
44.           The proposed project focuses on the strengthening of the institutional capacity of GOST&#13;
to create the enabling environment relating to standards in a market economy including harmonization&#13;
of Russia's standards. Regular Bank supervision with timely field visits is essential to achieve project&#13;
goals. However, GOST is not a new institution. It has traditionally been responsible for the development&#13;
of standards, and would not require extensive Bank supervision. A supervision schedule is contained in&#13;
Appendix IX. In terms of supervision the key outputs are noted below. A mid-term review will be held&#13;
early in 1997 to determine the status of Russia's accession to the WTO, the Government's trade policy,&#13;
and the standards-related policy environment confronting importers and exporters.&#13;

Enquiry point&#13;
(1)    Creation of the organizational structure of the Russian Data Center (the enquiry point);&#13;
determination of its responsibilities; appointment of staff; securing of premises.&#13;
(2)    Installation of computer and telecommunications equipment.&#13;
(3)    Development of database structure and software.&#13;
(4)    Creation of standards databases.&#13;
(5)    Linking standards-writing, testing and certification entities to the network.&#13;
Harmonization&#13;
(1)    Identify the more important inconsistent standards, with an impact on international trade.&#13;
(2)    Adopt new standards on a case-by-case basis.&#13;
Certification&#13;
(1)    Installation of relevant testing and metrology equipment.&#13;
(2)    Identification of personnel to be sent for overseas training in certification.&#13;
(3)    Adopt certification mechanisms and procedures required under relevant international&#13;
protocols.&#13;
(4)    Request accreditation by relevant international certification bodies.&#13;
X. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY, BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
46.           The proposed project does not pose any unusual difficulties to be sustained over the long&#13;
term. The project will assist the Government to satisfy WTO requirements, and in the process, help to&#13;
integrate Russia's export sector for manufactures into the world economy. Much of what is to be&#13;
established by the proposed project is required by WTO and therefore would need to be sustained as long&#13;
as Russia desires to remain a member in good standing. The proposed project builds upon initiatives&#13;
already introduced by the Government including the commitment of significant resources to the proposed&#13;
project, such as investing in the preparation of qualified personnel, on an ongoing basis, to maintain&#13;
technological currency. At the level of the exporter, increasing market orientation would result in&#13;
continuous need for current standards information. Consequently, GOST would be well prepared to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Russia: Standards Development Project                                               Page 22&#13;
sustain increased demand for its services while helping keep Russian manufacturers informed of the latest&#13;
development in international standards.&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
47.           This project is likely to have high returns to the Russian Federation as a whole, because&#13;
it aims to promote the development of Russian exports, which are necessary for recovery and growth in&#13;
the economy. Increased manufactured exports would contribute to the diversification of Russia's export&#13;
base away from what is becoming an over reliance on natural resources. Greater export orientation of&#13;
manufactured products will enhance the competitiveness of Russian enterprises. If successfully done, this&#13;
will have a potentially strong demonstration effect for the manufacturing sector as a whole. Instituting&#13;
a standards and certification system in line with international practice, modernizing existing standards and&#13;
making them more accessible to the manufacturers would improve product quality and enhance the&#13;
reputation of Russian manufactured goods, both in the domestic and export markets. Facilitating the&#13;
accreditation of Russian testing centers will also help lower costs of entering export markets.&#13;
48.           From a policy perspective, the project would support the development of an institutional&#13;
framework for standards and certification, which is required for accession to the WTO, and result in a&#13;
reduction in exposure to arbitrary trade barriers imposed by trading partners, and external discipline&#13;
regarding Russia's trade policy stance. Over the longer term, the project would contribute towards an&#13;
enabling environment for continued dialog with the Government.&#13;
Project Risks and Mitigation&#13;
49.           The project is subject to the risk that the conditions for accession to the WTO will not&#13;
be completed and the expected evolution of standards harmonization and integration thus compromised.&#13;
However, the authorities are pressing ahead with accession to the WTO and the Bank and the IMF are&#13;
supporting this process through dialog and through proposed policy lending operations. From an&#13;
institutional perspective,the main risk is slow or inefficient utilization of funds due to unfamiliarity with&#13;
Bank procedures concerning procurement, disbursement and project management. While a Canadian&#13;
grant is already operational and financing consultancy services to reduce this risk, the project&#13;
implementing agency GOST, has met conditions of Board presentation by establishing a fully staffed&#13;
PPIU, which, from all indications is making good progress in preparatory work.&#13;
XI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
Agreements Reached&#13;
50.          As agreed, GOST provided documentation on the structure and personnel of the PPIU,&#13;
including counterpart staff and foreign experts who have been identified in agreement with the Canadian&#13;
authorities. The latter agreement specified the Terms of Reference for each of the foreign experts,&#13;
ensuring that project implementation requirements are adequately reflected.&#13;
51.          As agreed, GOST has established the PPIU and appointed its Director and Finance&#13;
Officer, thereby fulfilling a condition of Boardpresentation. GOST will review with the Bank by March&#13;
&#13;

Appendix I&#13;
STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
GOST&#13;
Background&#13;
1.           The Committee of the Russian Federation for Standardization, Metrology and Certification&#13;
(GOST) is the main agency responsible for the formulation and implementation of policies in the field&#13;
of standardization in Russia. GOST has existed for decades, being one of the founding members of the&#13;
International Standards Organization (ISO). It was a very large body under central planning, in principle&#13;
being responsible for monitoring the production of enterprises to ensure conformity to existing standards.&#13;
In the former Soviet Union all standards were mandatory, giving GOST a very far-reaching mandate.&#13;
In the process of economic transformation, GOST was given a much more narrowly defined role with&#13;
tasks that are now analogous to that of a national (or federal) standards body in a market economy.&#13;
GOST is ranked as a Ministry and reports to the Deputy Prime Minister (Economics).&#13;
Organizational Structure&#13;
2.            GOST has been substantially downsized since the late 1980s. Total employment declined&#13;
from some 90,000 to 30,000 currently, partly as the result of the dissolution of the USSR (the fonner&#13;
Soviet Republics forming their own standards bodies). As can be seen from the organizational chart&#13;
below, GOST currently has 19 scientific and research institutes, 9 plants where measurement (metrology)&#13;
equipment is produced, 101 centers for standardization and metrology (the so-called territorial bodies of&#13;
GOST), and a publishing house ("Standartizat"). About 1,600 people are employed in the research&#13;
establishments; 4,100 in the metrology equipment plants; and 19,500 in the centers for standardization&#13;
and metrology.&#13;
Responsibilities&#13;
3.           Development of mandatory standards required by legislation. Under the existing legal&#13;
framework GOST is responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory standards (i.e., those&#13;
that are defined by law).  Relevant laws in this connection include: on Standardization; on the&#13;
Certification of Goods and Services; on Consumer Protection; and on the Uniformity of Measurements.&#13;
These laws are intended to meet health, safety and environmental objectives or to ensure the&#13;
interchangeability of products. In contrast to the past, industries are responsible for the development and&#13;
adoption of their own voluntary standards for product or process specifications, subject to the generally&#13;
applicable mandatory health and safety related standards. Such voluntary standards are developed in the&#13;
context of technical committees for standardization that are organized and chaired by a firm or industry.&#13;
GOST's role is limited to publishing the standard once it has been adopted. All voluntary standards must&#13;
be reported to GOST, as it is the official registrar of standards in Russia (see below).&#13;
4.            Certification systems. GOST is also responsible for developing the certification systems&#13;
(criteria) that must be used to enforce the mandatory standards embodied in the relevant laws.&#13;
Certification systems for products are consistent with the various schemes in this domain that have been&#13;
developed by the ISO. GOST's involvement in the testing and certification of products on the basis of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Russia: Standards Development Project                                                      Page 26&#13;
mandatory standards is limited. Most such certification is undertaken by accredited testing laboratories&#13;
that are independent of GOST. The number of such accredited labs has grown significantly during the&#13;
last two years. Standing at 332 in early 1993, the number had increased to 1,300 as September 1994.&#13;
GOST itself operates only 6 percent of all such bodies in Russia. Most testing laboratories are part of&#13;
branch Ministries, and have been part of the privatization process insofar as their sector has been&#13;
affected. Currently some 20 percent of the labs have been privatized. About 30 percent of all accredited&#13;
testing bodies are new entities.&#13;
5.             The Consumer Protection Law requires mandatory certification of both domestic and&#13;
imported products that may constitute hazards to human health, safety or the environment. Enactment&#13;
of this law was the rationale for the adoption of the Law on Certification. The following products are&#13;
subject to certification: foodstuffs, consumer goods, toys, cosmetics and perfume, certain chemicals, and&#13;
household appliances and electric/electronic equipment. A system (the GOST R system) has been&#13;
developed that establishes how certification of specific products and processes (whether to mandatory,&#13;
national standards, or voluntary standards) can be obtained, and sets out the criteria that must be met by&#13;
private testing labs for these to be accredited by GOST. The system is consistent with international&#13;
guidelines for certification that have been developed under ISO auspices, and is open to foreign&#13;
participation. As of September 1994, GOST has certified 475 accreditation bodies. As is the case with&#13;
testing labs, foreign as well as domestic bodies may apply for accreditation.&#13;
6.            Information dissemination. The collection and provision of information on standards and&#13;
certification systems is another task of GOST. It maintains a register of certification systems and&#13;
conformity marks. It is the body from which potential exporters to Russia can obtain information&#13;
regarding the products that are subject to mandatory certification, copies of the relevant legislative acts,&#13;
certification rules and procedures, as well as information on accredited certification bodies in Russia and&#13;
abroad, and data on the conformity marks accepted by GOST. GOST also maintains databases of foreign&#13;
standards to which Russian firms can turn for information on applicable standards in potential export&#13;
markets. In all, GOST currently has 7 automated databanks. VNIIKI, the body in GOST responsible&#13;
for the collection and dissemination of both Russian and foreign standards, also publishes standards and&#13;
has a substantial printing  operation.   GOST's territorial bodies also provide information on&#13;
standardization, metrology and certification.&#13;
7.             Relationship with the private sector. There are no formal barriers to entry facing foreign&#13;
specialized testing and certification bodies that seek to establish laboratories in Russia. However, foreign&#13;
entities have not been accredited to test/certify on the territory of Russia that products meet mandatory&#13;
health and safety standards. Foreign entities are restricted in their activities to certification that voluntary&#13;
industry-specific standards or international quality standards have been met.  GOST has accepted&#13;
certification of imported products by the Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS), (i.e., it accepts&#13;
certificates of conformity from 140 SGS labs around the world that meet the relevant mandatory Russian&#13;
standards). ' GOST also accepts imported products that have been certified to meet international standards&#13;
or those of major standards writing bodies such as DIN (Germany), BSI (United Kingdom), or AFNOR&#13;
(France). It is particularly interested in attracting foreign firms to certify Russian products for export&#13;
markets. Firms such as SGS, Lloyds and Bureau Veritas have been engaged in certification of Russian&#13;
firms for export (e.g., ISO-9000 quality certification in the aircraft and car industries).&#13;
1/     Some of the testing labs that have been accredited by GOST are located outside Russia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Russia: Standards Development Project                                                 Page 27&#13;
8.            GOST does not have a monopoly over the development and enforcement of mandatory&#13;
standards.  There are some 24 "Central Certification Bodies" in Russia that are involved in such&#13;
activities, including the Ministry of Health, the State Committee on Nuclear Power Supervision, the State&#13;
Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision, and the State Committee for Construction. One&#13;
of the tasks that must be accomplished as part of the establishment of the WTO enquiry point is to ensure&#13;
that all such standards are collected in one database, and that foreign trading partners are informed of&#13;
ongoing developments. GOST is not directly involved in the formulation of voluntary standards. These&#13;
are the responsibility of industry.  Such standards are developed in technical committees for&#13;
standardization (of which there are currently 291).&#13;
Financial situation&#13;
9.            GOST has been under significant financial pressure the last three years and has been&#13;
forced to adapt to a situation where it must rely on fee-based services for an increasing share of its&#13;
income. Only its headquarters in Moscow is totally dependent on the Budget for its resources (this&#13;
consists mostly of wages for some 300 staff). Resources from the Government Budget currently account&#13;
for 39 percent of GOST's income. Fees received from accredited testing labs and certification bodies&#13;
account for a further 5 percent. All labs accredited by GOST are required to transfer to GOST a fixed&#13;
share of all fee income generated from testing products for conformity with mandatory (legislated)&#13;
standards. The use to which these funds may be put is earmarked by law: they must be used for activities&#13;
such as investment in equipment or participation in international certification activities. They cannot be&#13;
used to pay wages. Fees for testing or certification are based on a cost plus formula: total costs plus 30&#13;
percent. Fees for testing of products for conformity with mandatory (legislated) standards are set by the&#13;
Ministry of Finance in cooperation with GOST. The objective is that this activity be provided on a non-&#13;
profit basis. Fees for testing and certification of voluntary standards is unconstrained.&#13;
10.           GOST's metrology and testing and certification bodies depend to a large extent on income&#13;
derived from testing and certification, from contracts with industry, and from publishing. For example,&#13;
ROSTEST (Moscow), the major metrology and testing/certification agency of GOST in Moscow, derives&#13;
only 15 of its budget from the state, the remainder being financed through fees for testing etc. VNIIKI,&#13;
GOST's information agency also illustrates the shift towards external sources of income. It increasingly&#13;
charges for its information services.  For example, it has negotiated contracts with large Russian&#13;
enterprises that involve linking these firms on an on-line basis to its databases of standards. It has also&#13;
developed a database that contains information on more than 60,000 Russian enterprises, including&#13;
product lines and technical specifications and capacity. The Institute is attempting to capitalize upon its&#13;
networks with and knowledge of Russian industry to compile and sell such data and to undertake market&#13;
studies and similar analyses.&#13;
11.          It is expected that GOST's financial situation will improve over time as privatization&#13;
proceeds. Under a 3-year program of de-monopolization, it is expected that 10 of the 19 scientific and&#13;
research institutes will be spun off. However, by law, GOST's metrology, mandatory standardization,&#13;
and information functions cannot be privatized. In these cases the relevant bodies will remain public&#13;
entities with a non-profit status.&#13;

STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
WTO Disciplines on Standards&#13;
1.            There are two standards-related agreements in the recent Agreement establishing the&#13;
WTO. one on product standards and one on sanitary and phytosanitary measures.&#13;
Product standards&#13;
2.            The WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade has three major parts: (1) disciplines&#13;
dealing with the adoption of technical regulations and standards in Member countries; (2) provisions&#13;
dealing with conformity assessment, testing and certification; (3) and transparency provisions relating to&#13;
existing standards and certification procedures. Central government bodies must ensure that technical&#13;
regulations are not more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective, and are applied&#13;
on a non-discriminatory basis. Where relevant international standards exist or are near completion, they&#13;
should be used as a basis for technical regulations, except if this would be ineffective or inappropriate&#13;
because climatic or geographical factors or fundamental technological problems.  Product-specific&#13;
technical regulations should be worded in terms of performance rather than design or descriptive&#13;
characteristics.&#13;
3.            Whenever the technical content of a proposed technical regulation is not in accordance&#13;
with international standards, and if the regulation may have a significant effect on trade, the WTO&#13;
Secretariat is to be notified of the products to be covered by the proposed technical regulation, together&#13;
with a brief indication of its objective and rationale. Such notifications must allow enough time for&#13;
amendments to be introduced and comments taken into account. All technical regulations which have&#13;
been adopted must be published promptly. A reasonable interval between publication and entry into force&#13;
of a regulation must be maintained in order to allow time for producers in other countries to adapt their&#13;
products or methods of production.&#13;
4.            In the preparation, adoption and application of voluntary standards, central government&#13;
standardizing bodies are to comply with a Code of good practice. This code requires, inter alia, that&#13;
activities of standardizing bodies conform to WTO's MFN and national treatment principles, as well as&#13;
the various requirements applying to technical regulations. At least once every six months, standardizing&#13;
bodies are to publish a work program containing their name and address, the standards currently under&#13;
preparation and the standards which were adopted in the preceding period. The work program is to&#13;
indicate the classification relevant to the subject matter, the stage attained in the standard's development,&#13;
and the references of any international standards taken as a basis. Work programs are to be notified to&#13;
the ISO/IEC Information Centre in Geneva.&#13;
5.            Conformity assessment procedures are to be applied on a nondiscriminatory basis,&#13;
expeditiously, and with respect for confidentiality requirements. Procedural requirements are very similar&#13;
to those applying to the development of national standards. If relevant guides or recommendations issued&#13;
by international standardizing bodies exist, central government bodies are to use these in their conformity&#13;
assessment procedures. If they do not exist, and the procedure used may impact significantly on trade,&#13;
countries are to publish them at an early stage, notify the WTO Secretariat, and allow for comments.&#13;

WTO members are, wherever practicable, to formulate and adopt international systems for conformity&#13;
assessment and become members thereof or participate therein. The results of conformity assessment&#13;
procedures by central government bodies in other Members are to be accepted, even when those&#13;
procedures differ from their own, provided they are satisfied that those procedures offer an assurance of&#13;
conformity with applicable technical regulations or standards equivalent to their own procedures.&#13;
Members are encouraged to enter into negotiations for the conclusion of agreements for the mutual&#13;
recognition of results of each other's conformity assessment procedures.&#13;
6.            The third component of the standards agreement pertains to information about technical&#13;
regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures. Each Member of the WTO is to establish&#13;
an enquiry point which is able to answer all reasonable enquiries from other Members and interested&#13;
parties in other Members as well as to provide the relevant documents regarding: (1) any technical&#13;
regulations adopted or proposed within its territory by central or local government bodies, by non-&#13;
governmental bodies which have legal power to enforce a technical regulation; (2) any standards adopted&#13;
or proposed within its territory by central or local government bodies; (3) any conformity assessment&#13;
procedures, or proposed conformity assessment procedures, which are operated within its territory by&#13;
central or local government bodies, or by non-governmental bodies which have legal power to enforce&#13;
a technical regulation, or by regional bodies of which such bodies are members or participants; (4) the&#13;
membership and participation of the Member, or of relevant central or local government bodies within&#13;
its territory, in international and regional standardizing bodies and conformity assessment systems, as well&#13;
as in bilateral and multilateral arrangements within the scope of this Agreement; they must also be able&#13;
to provide reasonable information on the provisions of such systems and arrangements; (5) the location&#13;
of relevant notifications and documents; and (6) the location of the enquiry points. Governments are also&#13;
to take measures to ensure that enquiry points are also able to answer enquiries regarding standards&#13;
adopted or proposed within its territory by non-governmental standardizing bodies, or by regional&#13;
standardizing bodies of which such bodies are members or participants; as well as conformity assessment&#13;
procedures operated by non-governmental or regional bodies.&#13;
Sanitary and Phyto-sanitary Measures&#13;
7.            The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures applies to all&#13;
sanitary and phytosanitary measures which may, directly or indirectly, affect international trade. A&#13;
sanitary or phytosanitary measure is defined as any measure applied: to protect animal or plant life or&#13;
health from risks arising from the entry, establishment or spread of pests, diseases, disease-carrying&#13;
organisms or disease-causing organisms; to protect human or animal life or health from the risks arising&#13;
from additives, contaminants, toxins or disease-causing organisms in foods, beverages or feedstuffs; to&#13;
protect human life or health from risks arising from diseases carried by animals, plants or products&#13;
thereof, or from the entry, establishment or spread of pests; or to prevent or limit other damage within&#13;
the territory of the Member from the entry, establishment or spread of pests. Sanitary or phytosanitary&#13;
measures include all relevant laws, decrees, regulations, requirements and procedures, including product&#13;
criteria; processes and production methods; testing, inspection, certification and approval procedures;&#13;
quarantine treatments; provisions on relevant statistical procedures and risk assessment methods; and&#13;
packaging and labelling requirements directly related to food safety.&#13;
8.            Sanitary or phytosanitary measures may be applied only to the extent necessary to protect&#13;
human, animal or plant life or health, are based on scientific principles and are not to be maintained&#13;
without sufficient scientific evidence. Such measures may not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate&#13;
between Members where identical or similar conditions prevail, or be applied in a manner which would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Russia: Standards Development Project                                                      Page 31&#13;
constitute a disguised restriction on international trade. The measures employed are to be based on&#13;
international standards, guidelines or recommendations, where they exist. Sanitary or phytosanitary&#13;
measures which result in a higher level of protection than would be achieved international standards may&#13;
be used if there is a scientific justification, or if justified by the implementation of risk assessment&#13;
techniques developed by the relevant international organizations.&#13;
9.             Sanitary or phytosanitary measures must be based on an assessment of the risks to human,&#13;
animal or plant life or health, taking into account risk assessment techniques developed by the relevant&#13;
international organizations. In the assessment of risks available scientific evidence must be taken into&#13;
account; as well as relevant processes and production methods; inspection, sampling and testing methods;&#13;
the prevalence of specific diseases or pests; the existence of pest-or disease-free areas; ecological and&#13;
environmental conditions; and quarantine or other treatment. In determining the measure to be imposed,&#13;
account must be taken of economic factors as well, including: the potential damage in terms of loss of&#13;
production or sales in the event of the entry, establishment or spread of a pest or disease; the costs of&#13;
control or eradication in the territory of the importing Member; and the relative cost effectiveness of&#13;
alternative approaches to limiting risks. The measures used should not be more trade restrictive than&#13;
required to achieve the appropriate level of protection, taking into account technical and economic&#13;
feasibility. Conformity assessment procedures and fees are to be based on MFN and national treatment,&#13;
procedures and criteria are to be published, confidentiality respected, and an appeals procedure&#13;
established.&#13;
10.            Members must publish all sanitary and phytosanitary regulations which have been adopted&#13;
and allow for a reasonable interval between the publication of a regulation and its entry into force in&#13;
order to allow time for producers in exporting Members to adapt their products and methods of&#13;
production to the requirements. An enquiry point must be created which is responsible for the provision&#13;
of answers to all reasonable questions from interested Members as well as for the provision of relevant&#13;
documents regarding: (a) any sanitary or phytosanitary regulations adopted or proposed within its&#13;
territory; (b) any control and inspection procedures, production and quarantine treatment, pesticide&#13;
tolerance and food additive approval procedures, which are operated within its territory; (c) risk&#13;
assessment procedures, factors taken into consideration, as well as the determination of the appropriate&#13;
level of sanitary and phytosanitary protection; (d) the Membership and participation of relevant bodies&#13;
within its territory in international and regional sanitary and phytosanitary organizations and systems, as&#13;
well as in bilateral and multilateral agreements and arrangements, and the texts of such agreements and&#13;
arrangements. A single central government authority is responsible for the implementation, on the&#13;
national level, of the notification provisions of the agreement.&#13;
11.           Whenever the content of a proposed regulation is not substantially the same as the content&#13;
of an international standard, guideline or recommendation, and if the regulation may have a significant&#13;
effect on trade of other Members, the WTO Secretariat must be notified of the products to be covered&#13;
by the regulation together with a brief indication of the objective and rationale of the proposed regulation.&#13;
Such notifications must occur at an early stage to allow amendments to be introduced and comments taken&#13;
into account.&#13;

THE STANDARDS ENQUIRY POINT&#13;
GOST Standards Network Summary Description&#13;
1.             As part of the institution building effort for export development and to help Russia meet&#13;
its future obligations under WTO (the establishment of a WTO standards "Enquiry Point"), the World&#13;
Bank is providing funding for the implementation of a network of computer systems for the maintenance&#13;
and dissemination of standards and certification information. Intended users of the network include (see&#13;
Figure below):&#13;

(iii)   International and trading partners' standards organizations,&#13;
(iv)    Local exporters and foreign importers.&#13;
2.             The Standards Network project includes the primary Enquiry Point data center in Moscow&#13;
plus the institutes, ministries and regional centers listed above, which maintain local standards, product&#13;
specification and certification databases. The Enquiry Point data center system will be a large network&#13;
and document database server system, including document scanners, optical storage and extensive&#13;
document database management and communications software. The institute, ministry and regional center&#13;
systems will house local databases for both local and remote access, and provide general network access&#13;
for local users. All systems will be equipped with software tools for development of local databases and&#13;
applications.&#13;

Technical Annex&#13;
Russia: Standards Development Project                                                            Page 36&#13;
3.              Network access for local exporters will require no more than a personal computer and&#13;
modem to connect to the nearest regional system for access to the entire network. Access to Russian&#13;
standards information from abroad will be addressed by interconnection with the international Internet&#13;
network, using the facilities of the World Wide Web (WWW) and readily available document browser&#13;
software. The formatting of WWW documents is consistent with that used by WTO for its own&#13;
documents, which will result in improved project efficiencies and reduced implementation and&#13;
maintenance costs. A secondary benefit of having a nationwide network bridged to the Internet is the&#13;
provision of electronic mail to facilitate internal and external communications. A future benefit of the&#13;
Internet connection will be to provide Russian exporters with access to its increasingly important research,&#13;
marketing and communications facilities.&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
4.              The primary application for the GOST network is the maintenance and dissemination of&#13;
standards documents and associated reference information. Electronic mail to facilitate both internal and&#13;
external communications is a secondary application. Rather-than building its own international network,&#13;
GOST will use the worldwide Internet to exchange standards information with many foreign institutions&#13;
(e.g. WTO, ISO, ANSI, DIN, IEEE, etc.) and firms. Since the Internet is not so well established&#13;
throughout the many regions of Russia, GOST will interconnect its own systems (and local exporters)&#13;
using an established Russian network, of which there are only a few to choose from. Geographic&#13;
coverage is one of the most important selection criteria, along with cost and reliability of service.&#13;
5.              The network, standards databases and the document management and dissemination&#13;
applications will take approximately two years to implement and populate with the necessary information.&#13;
The roles and responsibilities of the various parties for project implementation are shown in the following&#13;

Project Operational Funding&#13;
6.            Once the network is operational, funds to cover operational costs will be obtained from&#13;
the following sources:&#13;
(i)    Government budget to cover services provided to and by government ministries, and for&#13;
the facility and utility costs for operating the network and computers at the primary data&#13;
center, GOST institutes and regional centers.&#13;
(ii)    Fees for documents and information provided to foreign enquirers (except for summary&#13;
standards information that must be provided free under WTO rules).&#13;
(iii)   Fees for documents and information provided to Russian firms, although these will have&#13;
to be introduced gradually since many Russian firms are cash-short and are not used to&#13;
paying for information.&#13;
(iv)   Fees for possible value-added services provided to Russian firms, such as Internet access&#13;
and maintenance of on-line product specifications, catalogs and marketing information.&#13;
(Specifications are currently maintained free of charge.) To accommodate the volumes&#13;
of new and existing standards documents, the systems will require approximately 50GB&#13;
of storage, split between on-line (fixed disk) and near-line (optical disk jukebox) media.&#13;
Scanners and "Optical Character Recognition" (OCR) software will be provided for some&#13;
of the graphics workstations to facilitate conversion of existing documents to electronic&#13;
form.&#13;

Appendix V&#13;
PPIU ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS&#13;
A.    Project Preparation and Implementation Unit&#13;
1.           The Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (PPIU), created to administer the project&#13;
on behalf of the Government, will report to senior management officials in GOST. The PPIU will be&#13;
responsible for daily direction and coordination of project implementation and assisting the Ministry, Data&#13;
Center, Certification units and other participants with implementation requirements. It will have&#13;
contracting authority and will administer funding flows, monitor progress under the components, and&#13;
report to the Government, World Bank and other donors, as appropriate, on management issues and&#13;
progress with overall implementation.&#13;
2.           The PPIU established by GOST is already in place and ready for limited project&#13;
implementation. The PPIU will operate at full capacity for about two years during project start up and&#13;
initial implementation, and will then be scaled back in phases to a smaller staff needed for accounting and&#13;
residual reporting for the remaining two years. PPIU staff would be trained and/or assisted by local and&#13;
expatriate specialists and consultants under contract (e.g., procurement, audit, ISO systems/information&#13;
technology). As major project elements are completed, PPIU functions will probably be absorbed into&#13;
relevant divisions of GOST, completing the project's parallel objectives of institutionalization.&#13;
3.           The proposed PPIU organizational structure is illustrated in the chart below.&#13;

4.            The PPIU is led by a qualified Project Director, who is an employee of the Government.&#13;
Principal PPIU divisions will be staffed by Russians, but they will need technical assistance, at least&#13;
initially, for establishing and running their units. Foreign consultant assistance (an Operations Specialist&#13;
working with the Director and principal officers) would ensure compliance with procedural requirements&#13;
and prompt and efficient implementation of the PPIU's technical, administrative and training management&#13;
functions. PPIU staff would also be trained by World Bank specialists in disbursements, project&#13;
accounting and reporting. Consulting assistance would be secured via contracts with qualified firms in&#13;
procurement, computer equipment and systems design, and for the conduct of required independent&#13;
audits. The PPIU's budget would also enable the engagement of other consultant services that might be&#13;
needed as ISO database and training / expert exchange / study tour activities get fully underway.&#13;
5.            PPIU divisions will be providing guidance and operations oversight to implementation&#13;
managers in the Data Center and involved Institutes and Ministries. The PPIU will also be providing&#13;
these participants with administrative support regarding major procurement and disbursement actions, and&#13;
World Bank approvals associated therewith. The PPIU will also be responsible for setting up the overall&#13;
project accounting system, and arranging for periodic audit services, as required by the World Bank.&#13;
Funds for PPIU activities and its consulting assistance contracts will be provided by the Loan and by&#13;
GOU budgetary resources.&#13;
B.    PPIU Organizational Structure&#13;
6.            The PPIU will consist of a management section and three functional service units:&#13;
Training Coordination, Finance, and Administration.&#13;
PPIU Management&#13;
7.            The PPIU is headed by a full-time Project Director with overall responsibility for project&#13;
administration. The Director is an employee of the Government and appointed by, and reporting directly&#13;
to, GOST.  To fulfill his assigned responsibilities, the Director is authorized to recruit, manage and&#13;
supervise the PPIU's domestic employees and its expatriate consultants, and to decide and execute PIU&#13;
operations. The Director will be assisted by a senior expatriate Operations Specialist, who will likely be&#13;
funded by the proposed bilateral grant. The PPIU may also reserve some funds for other expatriate&#13;
assistance, such as for solving unforeseen technical problems, conducting additional training or, e.g.,&#13;
legal services.  The Director is expected to engage other technical assistance, such as for required&#13;
periodic audit services and procurement management assistance. The Director will regularly liaise with&#13;
the World Bank's project staff and visiting supervision missions.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Standards Development Project has
            three objectives: 1) support Russia's accession to the
            World Trade Organization (WTO) by helping it to meet WTO
            requirements in the area of product and process standards,
            which includes the establishment of an enquiry point for
            standards; 2) harmonize Russian standards with international
            standards particularly for export products; and 3) upgrade
            and strengthen Russian testing/certification capacity and
            institute mechanisms to facilitate international
            accreditation (recognition) of Russian testing and
            certification bodies, so as to increase the ability of
            Russian firms to receive pre-shipment certification of their
            exports. The project focuses on core institution building
            activities that include the financing of equipment and
            technical assistance. Its four components are: 1) the
            standards enquiry point; 2) standards harmonization; 3)
            certification and accreditation; and 4) a project
            preparation and implementation unit (PPIU).
