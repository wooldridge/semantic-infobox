                                                                                   HIRSCHTRITT:    He was paid by the Bank. which didn't matter except for&#13;
HIRSCHTRITT:     Douglas Dillon was Secretaty of the Treasury under                the salary level.    Who paid him didn't affect how the U.S. Director&#13;
President Kennedy. and Henry Fowler ("Joe" Fowler. as he was known) was            voted.    That was determ1ned by U.S. policy and U.S. Treasury&#13;
Under Secretary. I think at the time. if my memory is correct. Joe Barr            instructions.&#13;
was the Legislative Liaison.      On the international side, you had John          OLIVER:   When did that practice begin?&#13;
LeddyÂ·aa Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.        This was in '61 and '62.      HIRSCHTRITT:    That began with Livingston Merchant, who was Executive&#13;
They went through the first IDA Replenishment with negotiations                    Director while Winthrop Knowlton was Assistant Secretary and Henry&#13;
completed shortly after Woods came into the Bank in January '63.            John   Fowler was Secretary of the Treasury.     I have the date somewhere. but I&#13;
Bullitt became the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.           Under Leddy, I   don't think I will find it quickly.     It was in about 1966.&#13;
was the Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary.            Then, at some     OLIVER:    Never mind; I can find that out. You were an Alternate&#13;
point in this interval, I got promoted to Deputy to the Assistant                  Executive Director, were you not?&#13;
Secretary.     Hy responsibilities at the Treasury included the World              HIRSQJ.TRITT!     In 1964 and 1965. in addition to any general Treasury&#13;
Bank.   Leddy. in his tenure, and Bullitt. in his tenure, were the U. S.           responsibilities. Leddy. who was Assistant Secretary. related to the&#13;
Executive Directors of the World Bank, the IDA, and the IFC.                       Bank as well as the Fund.     During his tenure. Earl Cocke was the&#13;
        The drill at that time was to use the Assistant Secretary of               alternate at the World Bank paid by the Bank.     He was   ~    part of the&#13;
the Treasury (International) as the U. s. Executive Director, which                Treasury staff.&#13;
was, in many ways, a good idea.      I'm not quite sure how the Bank               OLIVER:   Was that at the same time Livingston Merchant was.          .1&#13;
presidents reacted to that.      I think George Woods didn't like it               HIRSCHTRITT:    No. it was earlier, in 1961-1964. that Earl Cocke was the&#13;
because the Assistant Secretar1es were always busy with non-bank                   u.s. Alternate Director.     He was quite an interesting character.        He is&#13;
matters: they were line officers with responsibilities to the Treasury             a story unto himself.&#13;
in the broad field of international finance and to the Congress.           More    OLIVER:   Where did he come from?   Was he an investment banker1&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        3                                                                                    4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HIRSCHTRITT:     No. he was a political appointee. appointed not because         choosing Livingston Merchant?&#13;
&#13;
of any background in this field.     He came from some State in the nearby       HIRSCHTRITT:       He was interested in having a full time US Executive&#13;
South.    He was active in the Aaerican Legion and things like that.        He   Director and certainly was consulted.       I don't know to what extent.        I&#13;
is a story unto himself.     I don't recall enough at the aoment to tell         don't recall now.       Livingston Merchant was a very prominent government&#13;
you too much about it.     He was an interesting man.   He was not an            official in the State Department.       I think be was Under Secretary of&#13;
investment banker as far as I can recall. nor was he an economic                 State.     He had a very prominent background, and he had good relations&#13;
development man.     At any rate. be left at acme point to run for               with the Congress which, among other things. Secretary of Treasury&#13;
political office and there was a vacancy.      I was the teuporary               Fowler considered quite important.       He was a hell of a nice fellow as I&#13;
&#13;
Alternate U.S. Director froa Hay. 1964. to September. 1965.      While I         recall.&#13;
was full-time Deputy Executive Director. I still reta1ned my                               Zagorin previously worked at the Treasury.    He worked with&#13;
&#13;
responsibilities at the Treasury:      I reported to the Assistant               me.   He was a very competent fellow fully acquainted with economic&#13;
&#13;
Secretary who was .y boss at the Treasury.                                       development problems and economic development.        He stayed at the World&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     He was the Executive Director?                                       Bank for about a year and then became a director of the Asian&#13;
&#13;
HIRSCHTRITT:    He was the Executive Director:   John Bullitt.                   Development Bank.       Gene Black was involved in that area.    You remember&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     So your term did not run concurrently with Livingston                Gene Black?&#13;
Merchant?                                                                        OLIVER:     Yes.    I do, indeed.&#13;
HIRSCHTRITT:     No. no.   When Livingston Merchant was appointed as US          HIRSCHTRITT:       Black was active in the Asian Bank formation.     But those&#13;
&#13;
Executive Director. Bernie Zagorin came with him from the Treasury as a          are just dates which you didn't want.       Where were we now7&#13;
full-time Alternate Director.      I went back to MÂ¥ Treasury roles which        OLIVER:     Who was the single most important American liaison between the&#13;
&#13;
included World Bank matters as far as the US was involved.       Merchant        Bank and the Treasury Department in the years '65 through late '677&#13;
&#13;
and Zagorin were full-time representatives residing at the Bank like             HIRSCHTRITT:       That's an embarrassing question.   I will have to mention&#13;
other Executive Directors.      That must have started late in September,        several people.       At first, Bullitt was there, Bullitt and me.     Of&#13;
&#13;
1965. which is about the time the question of the Second Replenishment           course the Secretary was not many streets away and took a close&#13;
&#13;
of IDA began to stir things up.                                                  interest.     The Secretary was involved -- Fowler; and when Livingston&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Do you know whether Hr. Woods personally had a hand in               Merchant came in, I guess it was he and Knowlton and myself with the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    . 5                                                                              6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Secretary of the Treasury paying close attention.                            National Advisory Council (Treasury. State. Commerce. AID. and the Fed&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   So even after you ceased being Alternate Executive Director        Reserve) which reviewed specific loans and other aspects of Bank&#13;
&#13;
and were full time back in the Treasury. you still continued to have         activity from the US point of view. so that it was also an inter-agency&#13;
&#13;
some contact.                                                                affair.     The Treasury was accused in two directions:   one. favoring the&#13;
&#13;
HIRSCHTRITT:    I continued to have a very close contact.                    multilateral institutions and pushing them, and. two. being rather&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   You're the man I need to see then.                                 niggardly about giving aid. which wasn't true.&#13;
HIRSCHTRITT:    Well the problem is I can't remember most of that stuff.               The thinking at the Treasury at that time was that. after the&#13;
&#13;
~   notes are missing.    They are in the Treasury.   I have to go through   First Replenishment. there should be a substantial increase in IDA.         It&#13;
&#13;
all kinds of security checks to get to see them. I guess.                    was a good way of providing assistance with the burden being shared&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Well. tell what you can about those years and the IDA              with other donar governments and through an organization. the World&#13;
&#13;
replenishment problems.                                                      Bank. which had our respect and the     respect of Congress.   We were very&#13;
&#13;
HIRSCHTRITT:    Yes.   I guess the replenishment problem goes back before    Congressionally oriented. because that was where we got the approval&#13;
&#13;
the Second Replenishment.     Soon after the First Replenisbaent -- I        for the money.     At that time. bilateral aid didn't have as much of the&#13;
&#13;
guess Secretary Dillon was in office then. we bounced around what            respect of the Congress. although it was a growing phenomena in&#13;
&#13;
happens here and there and elsewhere for the incoming Secretary:             finances.&#13;
&#13;
briefing books and position papers.     We began to th1nk about where you              We were questioned by our boss about what you can expect&#13;
&#13;
go right after we got the first piece of change.      We also consulted      realistically in terms of increases.     To jump too far ahead for a&#13;
&#13;
with other departments: AID. or whatever its name was at the time. and       second replenishment would be unrealistic.     Congress thought the World&#13;
&#13;
the State Department were very active in thinking about these things.        Ban~   was a good institution. but there were a lot of problems going on&#13;
&#13;
       We at the Treasury felt that there should be a signif1cant            at the time which made IDA not as readily acceptable; it took money. 40&#13;
&#13;
increase in the AID resources but within bounds of political realism in      percent or more. from the US -- that is appropriations. whereas the&#13;
&#13;
the US.   The Treasury was multilaterally oriented. and some other           World Bank relied mainly on guarantee authority rather than on&#13;
&#13;
agencies were more bilaterally oriented.     [There were a lot of poles.     appropriated funds. We envisaged that there would be some significant&#13;
&#13;
and I didn't know which direction we should you go in.J      The Treasury    increase. but not an unrealistic one:     a jump to S2 billion a year&#13;
&#13;
had the major responsibility for the international banks.      We had a      would have been an unrealistic increase from the going amount for the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                          7                                                                                8&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
us.                                                                              payments imbalance was good internationally.     We were supplying needed&#13;
&#13;
           You should remember that the balance of payments had been             capital to the world.     After World War II. the US supplied capital in&#13;
&#13;
considered a serious problem.       From time to time, the dollar was under      an etfort to improve the world economy. but the world economy had&#13;
&#13;
attack.     Certain European   ~ountries   did not feel comfortable              improved. and the US was still putting out money.     The dollar shortage&#13;
&#13;
accumulating more dollars that flowed out as a result of our balance of          was becoming a dollar glut.    The Europeans didn't care to bold, dollars&#13;
&#13;
payments deficits.       We were on a gold standard, or an approximate           to the extent they were getting them.     Some of them even wanted to buy&#13;
&#13;
equivalent of it and that added to discipline us financially. There              gold which was their right under the gold standard system.      At that&#13;
&#13;
were balance-of-payments restraints on a variety of US activities.               time it was kind of a sin. however -- an attack on our reserves.&#13;
&#13;
When President Kennedy came in, he had a balance-of-payments message.            CLIVER:     I remember.&#13;
&#13;
He had another balance-of-payments message in his tenure.         There was      HIRSCHTRITT:     So the balance-of-payments problem was   heat~ng   up again.&#13;
&#13;
Presidential and Congressional concern.         President Johnson kept close     although it was in existence from the Kennedy administration on and&#13;
&#13;
watch on measures to restrain the payments deficit.                              from before they came in.     There were also tax problems and budget&#13;
&#13;
          A number of steps were being taking taken to improve our balance       problems.&#13;
&#13;
of payments.     This was considered a deep and signif1cant problem.      When             Woods and associates began to talk about the Second&#13;
&#13;
the attack on the balance of payments seemed to be getting along in              Replenishaent shortly after agreement on First Replenishment was&#13;
1   65, the Viet Nam War was heating up again, and that caused military          completed.     Now, the time sequences begin to get a little vague in my&#13;
&#13;
expenditures and brought the balance-of- payments problem back to where          mind, but the essence of it was that Woods wanted a substantial&#13;
&#13;
it reversed the improvement trend.         The numbers at the time, when you     replenishment, and the question was how the US should react to that.&#13;
&#13;
look at them now, may seem insignificant. but were impressive at the             Without recalling the chronology, the major US and Treasury Secretary's&#13;
&#13;
time.                                                                            reactions that I recall, and I was closely involved in th1s phase, was:&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     That is because of the inflation since then.                         ''OK, we will go for a substantial amount provided that we get a&#13;
&#13;
HIRSCHTRITT:     The intlation, and we have gotten used to a whole new           balance-of-payments safe guard."     The US was willing to go for any&#13;
&#13;
order of â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢                                                                   reasonable amount (Iâ&#128;¢m throwing in the word "reasonable" for almost any&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Imbalance.                                                           amount) provided the other countries would go along and so long as we&#13;

HIRSCHTRITT:   Well, we probably would have done it in a way where it&#13;
                                                                           expenditure statistics. but we certainly looked at the figures&#13;
wasn't contrary to the Charter.    We had good lawyers.&#13;

OLIVER:   This must have been about the time that the Bank itself did a&#13;

study to try and show that the dollar aid given through IDA was in fact&#13;
                                                                           same thing.    Occasionally we fought with each other.    I don't think&#13;

                                                                           participate unless it got balance-of-payments safeguards.         I think. if&#13;
HIRSCHTRITT:   Yes. I recall several studies of this variety. because at&#13;
                                                                           I recall correctly. there was no give as far as the US was concerned on&#13;
the same time that we had the IDA question. we also had questions about&#13;
                                                                           moving without safeguards.&#13;
the World Bank's coming into the capital market to float bonds.&#13;

OLIVER:   I think there was a time in '66 when the Bank was denied&#13;
                                                                           of the Treasury.&#13;

HIRSCHTRITT:   Well. usually we didn't have formally to deny it.    This&#13;
                                                                           OLIVER:   I understand.&#13;

                                                                           HIRSCHTRITT:   The Secretary of the Treasury was for IDA for the&#13;
after they did financing elsewhere. maybe they could come here. In&#13;
                                                                           amounts proposed by the Bank.     He certainly said that he would go along&#13;
all of this. we also had to go to the Congress and show them that the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         11                                                                          12&#13;

CLIVER:    OK.                                                                 the US -- even though they did not come in with clean hands themselves&#13;
&#13;
HIRSCHTRITT:       It was not the US that cut down the bidding. it was the     in teDas of tied aid in their own programs.     They were the&#13;
&#13;
Europeans.       The US had to insist on maintaining its share -- the          beneficiaries as far as IDA procurement went.     They were reluctant too.&#13;
&#13;
percent or portion of whatever total amount â&#128;¢igbt be agreed upon.        It    and it took several meetings and a lot of persuasion on that and on the&#13;
&#13;
was clear that Congress would not approve an increase in the US share.         share question which was already a big stumbling block for the&#13;
&#13;
As a matter of fact. they loOked for a decrease. and I th1nk one of the        Europeans.   I guess there was also the duration question {the number of&#13;
&#13;
lesser points that we may have made was to seek ways of reducing our           years covered by the replenishment exercise).     The duration question&#13;
&#13;
share. Â· I think it actually went down to 40 percent from 42 percent.          was not prominent:   it was beginning to be accepted that it would be a&#13;
&#13;
These numbers may seem silly. but they were significant in terms of the        three year replenishment.   Burke Knapp was active in this. George Woods&#13;
&#13;
people we were dealing with who bad to pass the legislation. and they          was closely involved.   The President of the Bank and the Secretary of&#13;
&#13;
were indicative of trends.       Tbis was the burden sharing aspect of the     the TreaSUEY and the Assistant Secretary {International) were closely&#13;
&#13;
problem.                                                                       involved through all stages of these negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
           After considerable time in talking of balance of payments           OLIVER:   Well. sir. I want to thank you for a most interesting and&#13;
&#13;
safeguards. we began to work with the Bank -- I believe with Irving            informative conversation.   You have clarit1ed a number of important&#13;
&#13;
Friedman         to see what we could work out. and we came close to a         issues.&#13;
&#13;
formula.     I donâ&#128;¢t know whether it was the same. or close to what we&#13;
&#13;
finally ended up with. which provided that the US would pledge its                                             ADDENDUM&#13;
&#13;
share but make actual payments to IDA based upon procurement in the&#13;
&#13;
United States resulting from IDA assistance.       This arrangement would go   After the conclusion of the taped conversation. Hr. Hirschtritt added&#13;
&#13;
on for the first three years. after which we would put in the rest of          the following points:   Congressman Otto Passman. an important member of&#13;
&#13;
our share.       This was the end of the queue arrangement. so called.         the House Appropriations Committee. was a major opponent of the Second&#13;
&#13;
          I reca!l that the Bank was at first most reluctant to give           IDA Replenishment.   On September 27. 1968. Secretary Fowler explained&#13;
&#13;
balance-of-payments safeguards but finally th1s formula was worked out         the Treasury position in a significant letter to Senator Sparkman.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Hirschtritt personally led a tour of Congressmen to see some Bank&#13;
&#13;
financed projects.   The US governaent accounting off1ce undertook its&#13;
&#13;
own audit of World Bank activities -- a practice not undertaken by&#13;
&#13;
other member governments.   Same meaber governments opposed th1s&#13;
&#13;
practice even though it vas agreed to by Robert McNamara who later set&#13;
&#13;
up an independent evaluation unit within the Bank.   Hirschtr1tt has no&#13;
&#13;
doubt that the U. S. Treasury pushed as hard as it could for the Second&#13;
&#13;
IDA Replenishment with the Bank within the US and with the Congress&#13;
&#13;
which. as far as the US share was concerned. was the final determinant&#13;
&#13;
of US appropriations.   The Treasury was firm in its support of&#13;
multilateral aid through the World Bank and IDA generally.&#13;
