(TFO71818) whereby the Commission agreed to make contributions available to&#13;
the IBRD (collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "Contributions") for&#13;
the purpose of carrying out the Program for World Bank Knowledge and&#13;
Advisory Services in Pursuit of the Objectives of the EUROPE2020 Agenda to&#13;
be carried out under the Programmatic Trust Fund ("the Program").&#13;
The Commission hereby agrees to make available an additional Contribution for an&#13;
amount referred to in Section 3.02 (the "Support to Roma Living Conditions&#13;
(SRLC) Contribution"), and to be administered by the IBRD under the Program&#13;
for the purpose of availing technical assistance to inform the programming of the&#13;
2014-2020 cycle of the European Structural Funds, by exploring a range of good&#13;
practice options for integrated multi-sector interventions and participatory approach&#13;
that address the living conditions of Roma communities, drawing on EU and global&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿experience. This assistance will involve three components: (i) an inventory and&#13;
review of the projects directly addressing Roma living conditions, in order to&#13;
identify achievements made, difficulties encountered, and possibilities for future&#13;
collaboration; (ii) a review of relevant global practice of integrated interventions&#13;
that address living conditions of marginalized groups--these may comprise&#13;
elements from various communities of practice such as slum upgrading, land&#13;
registration in informal settlements, community-driven development, and assistance&#13;
with resettlement; and (iii) development of a modular handbook for preparing and&#13;
implementing effective integrated interventions that address living conditions of&#13;
Roma through European Structural Funds, as set out in detail in Annex I.A of this&#13;
Agreement (the " Support to Roma Living Conditions (SRLC) Activities").&#13;

ï»¿ANNEX I OF THE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT&#13;
Program description&#13;
1.    Rationale and Scope of the Programmatic Trust Fund&#13;
The Commission and the World Bank share a common vision of building competitive and&#13;
sustainable economies and in reducing poverty and social exclusion - goals of the Europe&#13;
2020 Agenda which is built on three pillars of smart, green and inclusive growth. To date, the&#13;
cooperation between the Commission and the World Bank has been largely indirect, with the&#13;
World Bank engaging directly with individual European countries on projects that are&#13;
financed by the governments in whole or in part by EU-origin resources, such as the&#13;
Structural Funds, the Rural Development Fund or the Instrument for Pre-Accession&#13;
Assistance (IPA). This experience has deepened the mutual appreciation for the&#13;
complementary competencies of each institution.&#13;
The Commission and the World Bank agree that more direct interaction would be beneficial&#13;
to both institutions and through them to the countries. This applies particularly to the&#13;
provision of analytical, advisory and knowledge services and technical assistance. The&#13;
Commission has already demonstrated its interest in specific analytical projects to be carried&#13;
out by the World Bank. The Commission has also expressed an interest in ensuring that the&#13;
World Bank provides technical assistance to inform the 2014-2020 programming cycle of the&#13;
European Structural Funds, by exploring a range of good practice options for integrated multi-&#13;
sector interventions and participatory approach that address the living conditions of Roma&#13;
communities, drawing on EU and global experience. This assistance will involve three&#13;
components: (i) an inventory and review of the projects directly addressing Roma living&#13;
conditions, in order to identify achievements made, difficulties encountered, and possibilities&#13;
for future collaboration; (ii) a review of relevant global practice of integrated interventions&#13;
that address living conditions of marginalized groups--these may comprise elements from&#13;
various communities of practice such as slum upgrading, land registration in informal&#13;
settlements, community-driven development, and assistance with resettlement; and (iii)&#13;
development of a modular handbook for preparing and implementing effective integrated&#13;
interventions that address living conditions of Roma through European Structural Funds .&#13;
There is good reason to anticipate that the Commission and the World Bank will continue to&#13;
collaborate on a number of themes under all three pillars of the Europe 2020 Agenda during&#13;
the remaining years of its implementation. This Programmatic Trust Fund is set up with the&#13;
express purpose of allowing the European Commission to avail itself of the World Bank's&#13;
analytical and policy capacity in fulfilling the goals ofEurope 2020.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿ANNEX L.A OF THE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT&#13;
Description of the SRLC Activities to the carried out under the Program and&#13;
the SRLC Contribution&#13;
In the framework and in line with the Program and Europe Agenda 2020, the objective of the&#13;
SRLC Activities is to inform the 2014-2020 programming cycle of the European Structural&#13;
Funds, by exploring a range of good practice options for integrated multi-sector interventions&#13;
and participatory approach that address the living conditions of Roma communities, drawing&#13;
on EU and global experience&#13;
Except as the Commission and the IBRD may otherwise agree, the IBRD shall perform the&#13;
following activities, subject to such modifications and refinements thereof as the Commission&#13;
and the IBRD may agree upon from time to time to achieve the objective thereof:&#13;
1.    Components&#13;
Component I: Review of Activities Addressing Living Conditions of Roma Communities&#13;
Activities under this Component will seek to identify activities addressing Roma living&#13;
conditions, gain a better understanding of the processes involved in the preparation of&#13;
activities funded by the European Structural Funds, and take stock of lesson learned, good&#13;
practices and key elements of effective activities and projects on Roma living conditions. In&#13;
this regard, activities will include:&#13;
(i)   A non-exhaustive inventory of interventions funded by the ERDF, other EU&#13;
Structural funds and other sources that address Roma living conditions in five new&#13;
EU member states (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia)&#13;
and five EU-15 member states (France, Greece, Italy, Spain and United Kingdom).&#13;
A set of basic information will be collected for each of these activities/projects,&#13;
and for the activities/projects funded by ERDF after May 2010, data will be&#13;
aggregated to conduct macro-analysis, mainly to review the alignment of ERDF-&#13;
funded projects to the principles of Article 7 of the ERDF. The parameters for&#13;
identifying the initiatives to be included in the inventory and the set of information&#13;
to be collected for each project in the inventory will be determined in collaboration&#13;
with the European Commission. The Information for the inventory and macro-&#13;
analysis will be gathered with the support of DG Regional Development EC desk&#13;
officers and country administrators, regional and local governments, and would&#13;
include program documents (e.g. project objectives, planned activities) as well as&#13;
available monitoring documents&#13;
(ii)  A process evaluation of activities/projects funded by the EU Structural Funds [in&#13;
relation to improving Roma living conditions] to assess among others:  (i)&#13;
processes undertaken in preparing and implementing the activity/project; (ii)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿challenges faced in preparing and implementing the activity/project; (iii) measures&#13;
taken to address the challenges (including good practices); (iv) mechanisms used&#13;
to integrate different measures; (v) how different stakeholders were consulted and&#13;
engaged in the process; (vi) capacity needs; (vii) whether available technical&#13;
assistance have been used to support integrated housing interventions; and (viii)&#13;
positive outcomes generated by the activities/projects so far.&#13;
(iii)  In-depth qualitative review of selected integrated interventions in order to collect&#13;
additional knowledge on project design features, approaches for integrated&#13;
interventions, good practices, and lessons learned. The sample will be selected on&#13;
the basis of the following criteria: (A) the progress made by interventions (i.e.&#13;
interventions need to be at least in implementation stage-those in planning stage,&#13;
or for which funds have only been approved will not be selected); (B) the extent to&#13;
which the interventions are integrated (at the minimum, interventions need to be&#13;
meeting the conditions of Article 7); and (C) the types of integration measures&#13;
applied (in order to ensure representative coverage of different types of measures&#13;
identified).&#13;
The in-depth review will consist of (i) desk review of existing project documents&#13;
(planning documents, consultations, impact evaluations, monitoring reports); and&#13;
(ii) focus groups and interviews with local authorities, beneficiaries, affected&#13;
communities (Roma and non-Roma), civil society, and other stakeholders (e.g.&#13;
service providers). This will be conducted as a forward-looking exercise, focusing&#13;
on lessons learned and recommendations for future programs. This activity will&#13;
recognize the fact that many of the interventions are still in progress, and the&#13;
review does not necessarily involve the monitoring and evaluation of results&#13;
indicators set to be monitored at the outset of the activities/projects.&#13;
In addition to the interventions financed under ERDF (and after the amendmend to&#13;
Article 7 of the ERDF), those financed by other sources and/or prior to Article 7&#13;
amendment and from EU-15 Member States and new EU Member States that&#13;
merit further review could also be included in this exercise. Such interventions&#13;
will be identified in consultation with the European Commission. This activity&#13;
will also benefit from a planned World Bank research study on Roma integration&#13;
in Romania (similar to the one completed for Slovakia).&#13;
Component II. Drawing Lessons from Relevant Global Experience&#13;
This Component will seek to highlight relevant global experience of programs that have been&#13;
effective in improving living conditions for marginalized groups. It will provide a detailed&#13;
overview of the design, process, participation, and monitoring methods for these programs.&#13;
This review will follow a case-study approach, highlighting projects that involve - in an&#13;
integrated manner - all or some of the following elements to benefit marginalized groups:&#13;
Slum Upgrading; Community-Driven Development (CDD); Access to Land for Vulnerable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Groups; Voluntary and Involuntary Resettlement; and Inclusion and Non-Discrimination&#13;
Practices.&#13;
Component III. Recommendations for Integrated Approaches to address Roma         living&#13;
conditions in the EU Context&#13;
Based on outputs from components I and II, the team will produce a set of operational&#13;
recommendations or guidelines in a modular handbook for integrated interventions to address&#13;
Roma living conditions through European Structural Funds, and monitoring of such&#13;
interventions. The handbook will be modularized by users, which include (i) Administrators of&#13;
Structural Funds from European Commission; (ii) Managing Authorities in Member States; and (iii)&#13;
Project Implementing Bodies including Municipalities and CSOs.&#13;
Component IV: Knowledge Exchange and Learning Visits to Successful Interventions&#13;
Following the review of good practices, this activity will include learning events and learning&#13;
visits to highlight successful interventions and create links between policy-makers,&#13;
international and local organizations and civil society for further knowledge exchange. A&#13;
visual map of good practice interventions on improving Roma living conditions in Europe,&#13;
based on the inventory and review of projects will also be prepared.&#13;
(d)    Required outputs:&#13;
The IBRD shall provide the following outputs:&#13;
1. Timeline&#13;
