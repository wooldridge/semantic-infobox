&amp;#12;&#13;
POLAND - POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT&#13;
Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:          The Polish Power Grid Company (PPGC).&#13;
Guarantor:         Republic of Poland.&#13;
Amount:            US$160 million equivalent.&#13;
Terms:             Currency pool loan with a maturity of 17 years, including four&#13;
years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.&#13;
Project&#13;
Objectives:        The project's objectives are to: (a) improve the reliability&#13;
of the existing high voltage grid through rehabilitation and&#13;
reinforcement; (b) enhance security of power supply in Poland&#13;
by interconnecting the Polish power grid with that of Western&#13;
Europe, thus improving Poland's power trade and wheeling&#13;
capability; (c) improve the network's operational performance&#13;
and control through transmission loss reduction and improved&#13;
dispatching, thereby enhancing energy conservation and&#13;
efficiency;  (d)  reduce  environmental  pollution;  and  (e)&#13;
enhance PPGC's institutional capabilities. The project takes&#13;
place within the framework of the continuing policy dialogue&#13;
with the Government regarding the energy sector restructuring&#13;
program, particularly as it relates to achieving further&#13;
improvement in energy pricing policies and introduction of a&#13;
sound regulatory framework.&#13;
Proj ect&#13;
Description:       The project comprises: (a) investments in rehabilitation and&#13;
upgrading of key substations and modernization of high voltage&#13;
transmission lines; and (b) technical assistance to PPGC.&#13;
Benefits:          The project has an estimated rate of return of 21%, using&#13;
PPGC's incremental transmission revenues as a proxy for the&#13;
economic benefits.   In qualitative terms benefits can be&#13;
described  as  follows:    (a)  enhanced  reliability  of  the&#13;
transmission system; (b) reduced transmission losses and&#13;
operation and maintenance costs; (c) increased income from&#13;
power wheeling and exports; and (d) reduced environmental&#13;
pollution.&#13;
Risks:             The main risk associated with the project is the possibility&#13;
of delayed increases in electricity prices.   Such a delay&#13;
could negatively affect PPGC's internal cash flow, needed for&#13;
further  system  improvements.       However,  this  risk  is&#13;
manageable, given the Government's commitment to energy price&#13;
reform  as  demonstrated  by  energy  pricing  adjustments&#13;
undertaken since 1990 and its efforts to introduce an energy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- viii -&#13;
regulatory framework, combined with recent favorable changes&#13;
in asset revaluation and depreciation policy. Furthermore,&#13;
the project's cash flow is based on the conservative&#13;
assumption of zero price increases in real terms over the&#13;
medium term.   Price  decreases  in real  terms  are highly&#13;
unlikely over the medium term and would, in first instance,&#13;
only lead to a slowing down of the pace of investments and&#13;
their associated benefits.   The risk of procurement and&#13;
implementation delays are manageable because: (a) PPGC has set&#13;
up a procurement unit that has received training from&#13;
specialized Bank staff; (b) adequate staff has been allocated&#13;
to the different project management activities. This staff&#13;
could, if necessary, be assisted by consultants who would&#13;
provide both functional support as well as training under the&#13;
project's technical assistance component; and (c) tight&#13;
reporting schedules on procurement and implementation progress&#13;
during supervision.&#13;

PART I - INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    In the context of its Economic Transformation Program (1990), the Polish&#13;
Government sought Bank cooperation to develop an energy policy that would enhance&#13;
efficiency and increase competition in the sector. Implementation started with&#13;
the Energy Resource Development Project (Loan 3215-POL), followed by the Heat&#13;
Supply Restructuring and Conservation Project (Loans 3377/83-POL) which included&#13;
a Sector Adjustment Loan (SECAL; Loan 3377-POL); and the Katowice Heat Supply and&#13;
Conservation Project (Loan 3809-POL). The SECAL supported a comprehensive energy&#13;
sector restructuring program, including price liberalization, commercialization&#13;
and privatization of energy sector enterprises where possible, and introduction&#13;
of a sound and consistent regulatory framework.&#13;
2.    The Polish Power Grid Company (PPGC) was the first enterprise in the&#13;
electric power sector to become a joint stock company.   The company is fully&#13;
owned by the Treasury, represented by the Ministry of Industry and Trade. PPGC&#13;
plays a pivotal role in the sector because of its dispatching and system planning&#13;
functions and because it has taken a lead role in defining, and seeking to&#13;
resolve, the issues related to the profound restructuring that the sector is&#13;
going through. The Government asked the Bank to assist in the preparation of a&#13;
high priority power transmission project to improve the reliability of the power&#13;
grid and reduce transmission losses, as well as to cooperate in sector investment&#13;
planning and in issues related to the proper functioning of PPGC in a&#13;
restructured power sector.&#13;
3.    Poland  is strategically  located between Eastern and Western Europe.&#13;
Because of its geographical position, the efficient interconnection and future&#13;
development of the European power network depends to a large extent on Poland's&#13;
ability to upgrade its power system in order to fully meet the performance and&#13;
interconnection criteria of the (West European) Union for the Coordination of&#13;
Production and Transmission of Electricity (UCPTE).&#13;
4.    However, a satisfactory performance of the Polish power system within the&#13;
European context can only be achieved by first ensuring a reliable domestic&#13;
system. The proposed US$276 million project aims to help achieve that goal. The&#13;
amount of the proposed Bank loan is US$160 million, covering 95% of the foreign&#13;
exchange costs of the project, or 58% of the total project costs after import&#13;
duties and taxes. The Bank loan would also cover interest during construction&#13;
on the loan amount given the length of the project's construction period and the&#13;
fact that the Bank loan would constitute only a modest portion of PPGC's overall&#13;
investment program financing requirements. The remaining project costs would be&#13;
funded by PPGC from net internal cash generation.&#13;
5.    Documents and detailed information concerning the sector and the project&#13;
are available in the Project File (Annex 1-1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PART 11 - THE SECTOR&#13;
A. Economic Significance&#13;
6.    The energy sector is one of the largest sectors of the Polish economy.&#13;
Energy intensity is estimated to be about two times as high as in European OECD&#13;
countries on a purchasing power of currency estimate of GDP basis, although per&#13;
capita energy consumption is at about 60% of the OECD level. New energy pricing&#13;
policies, introduced starting in 1990, have led to price levels and structures&#13;
that are now beginning to provide incentives for energy conservation and&#13;
efficiency.   The Government is no longer providing funding for energy sector&#13;
investments. The more efficient energy enterprises are beginning to have cash&#13;
flows which allow them to self-finance minor investments. Government subsidies&#13;
for energy production are now only provided to a small number of coal mines,&#13;
while subsidies for household consumption of heat have been reduced from 78% in&#13;
1991 to about 10% at the beginning of 1995. The fiscal impact of these policies&#13;
has been a dramatic reduction in energy sector outlays in the Government budget.&#13;
7.    Poland's energy sector consists of five subsectors: two energy producing&#13;
subsectors (hard coal/lignite and oil/gas), two energy conversion subsectors&#13;
(electric power and district heating), and one energy processing subsector (oil&#13;
refining).   Together,  they account  for about  10% of the country's  total&#13;
investments. The energy sector accounts for about 8% of GDP and directly employs&#13;
4% of the working population.&#13;
8.    Energy consumption  in Poland decreased substantially  as  the  economy&#13;
experienced a sharp decline starting in 1990 while energy prices were being&#13;
increased significantly. Industrial energy consumption declined by 31% through&#13;
1992 primarily due to the contraction in output in many industrial sectors and&#13;
closure or downsizing of several major energy-intensive industries. Residential&#13;
energy consumption decreased by 14% because of a considerable reduction in real&#13;
household incomes and proportionally larger increases in residential energy&#13;
prices. Corresponding to this, domestic energy production dropped by 20% for&#13;
coal and 25% for natural gas.   Coal exports decreased by almost one third.&#13;
Energy imports (mainly oil and natural gas) also decreased considerably due to&#13;
the overall decline in domestic energy consumption. As energy prices are moving&#13;
towards economic levels, energy consumption patterns are changing: the share of&#13;
coal, while still dominant, is declining in final consumption, and the share of&#13;
oil and gas is increasing. This process would accelerate when the current supply&#13;
constraints on natural gas decrease (para. 9). Details on energy production and&#13;
consumption are in Annex 2-1.&#13;
9.    The most crucial issue in energy trade is Poland's exclusive dependence on&#13;
Russia (via the Ukraine) for all its gas imports. Poland is concerned that the&#13;
economic and political situation there, and its potential impact on gas&#13;
production and transmission, could interrupt supplies. Hence, Poland is actively&#13;
examining alternative gas supply options such as supplies coming via a new&#13;
pipeline through Belarus, the Britannia field in the North Sea, or supplies from&#13;
Norway. These new supplies, however, are likely to be much more expensive than&#13;
the price of gas currently supplied by Russia (although that price is likely to&#13;
be revised upwards as well).   The Government and the Bank have an ongoing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
dialogue regarding the various gas import proposals and the guarantee issues&#13;
related to take-or-pay contracts.&#13;
B. Sector Restructuring&#13;
a. Development Policy&#13;
10.   Under the energy SECAL (Loan 3377-POL) of the Heat Supply Restructuring and&#13;
Conservation Project, the Government undertook to implement a comprehensive&#13;
energy sector restructuring program.   Major changes have been and are being&#13;
implemented in the energy sector in order to make it more competitive and viable.&#13;
Firstly, most subsectors have been demonopolized and restructured. Secondly,&#13;
many of the state-owned enterprises have been converted into joint stock or&#13;
limited liability companies. Privatization of selected companies would follow&#13;
as soon as possible, but the speed of the process depends on a number of factors&#13;
(e.g., political will, allowed return on equity, etc.).  Thirdly, energy prices&#13;
have been adjusted considerably. Fourthly, a new Energy Law will be introduced&#13;
which would, inter alia, put an appropriate regulatory framework into place and&#13;
create an Energy Regulatory Agency.   The regulatory framework would aim to&#13;
enhance competition, allow open access to new entrants, protect consumers and&#13;
avoid distortions in investment decisions between "network" fuels (district heat,&#13;
gas and electric power). Good progress was made under the SECAL in implementing&#13;
this energy sector restructuring program. However, continued implementation of&#13;
the Government's energy sector strategy is important, inter alia, in order to&#13;
enable private sector participation in development of the energy sector. Further&#13;
progress needs to be made in adjusting energy prices towards economic levels and&#13;
in introducing the new regulatory framework, and the Bank is continuing its&#13;
dialogue with the Government on these issues (paras. 14-15).&#13;
b. DemonoRolization. Commercialization and Restructuring&#13;
11.   A February 1993 law transferred the responsibility for commercialization&#13;
of the power and coal sectors to the Ministry of Industry.  Sixty three coal&#13;
mines have been grouped into seven commercialized multi-mine companies and three&#13;
commercialized single-mine companies. A closure program for 8 out of the total&#13;
of 71 mines has been initiated, and part or all of 4-5 other mines is expected&#13;
to be slated for closure. The power sector has been demonopolized into separate&#13;
transmission, generation and distribution companies. The transmission company&#13;
(the Polish Power Grid Company - PPGC), the 33 distribution companies and three&#13;
out of 34 generating plants have been commercialized.   The remaining 31&#13;
generation enterprises would be commercialized after their merger into a small&#13;
number of competitive generating companies has taken place. The Polish Oil and&#13;
Gas Company, the last remaining monopoly, would be commercialized by the end of&#13;
1995,  to be followed by separation of the service companies.   To enhance&#13;
competition, the first exploration and production licenses were awarded (to AMOCO&#13;
and British Gas). However, some contractual issues still need to be resolved&#13;
before exploration and production will start in earnest. Licensing rounds for&#13;
other acreage and for coal-bed methane exploration and production took place in&#13;
October 1992 and contracts were signed by AMOCO (IFC made a US$8.7 million equity&#13;
investment in an AMOCO-operated coalbed methane project) and McCormick. In the&#13;
district heating sector, significant restructuring and commercialization is&#13;
underway with a new emphasis on network efficiency improvements, energy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
conservation, cost reduction and competitiveness with other heat sources. About&#13;
100 out of 500 DHEs have been commercialized, including those of Gdansk, Gdynia&#13;
and Krakow, all Borrowers under the Bank's Heat Supply Restructuring and&#13;
Conservation Project.   Those enterprises have started to spin off service&#13;
companies which, in several instances, have been privatized. Six small DHEs have&#13;
been privatized, which makes the district heating sector the first energy sector&#13;
in Poland where actual privatization of operating companies took place. However,&#13;
it is unlikely that privatization of larger energy enterprises, such as&#13;
electricity generating plants,will occur in the near future. Finally, in the&#13;
petroleum sector all activities (refining, transmission and distribution) are&#13;
generally still in the hands of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), although there&#13;
are some joint ventures and fully independent companies on the distribution end.&#13;
The Government is in the process of defining its position with regard to the&#13;
future ownership structure of the petroleum sector.&#13;
c. Energy Pricing&#13;
12.   Energy price  reform has made major progress  since  1990.   Although&#13;
significant further adjustments remain necessary for prices to reach economic&#13;
levels, the impact is beginning to be felt in the areas of energy efficiency and&#13;
conservation and reduction of pollution. The main elements of the reform include&#13;
coal price liberalization, increase of industrial energy prices towards economic&#13;
levels, and gradual increases of household energy prices first to the level paid&#13;
by industrial consumers and then to levels reflecting economic costs.  After&#13;
major price adjustments of all network fuels through January 1, 1992, the&#13;
Government slowed down the pace of energy price increases. However, the system&#13;
of approximately quarterly price adjustments is expected to result in modest real&#13;
price increases over the medium term. Network fuel prices, though still being&#13;
controlled, are now on average at about 60% of their estimated economic levels,&#13;
with individual fuels ranging from 50-100% depending on tariff categories.&#13;
Network fuel tariff studies have been completed under terms of reference and with&#13;
consultants satisfactory to the Bank and could provide the Government with&#13;
guidance for the economic pricing of network fuels.&#13;
13.   Coal prices ex mine, now being set virtually freely by the market, have&#13;
almost reached import parity levels (adjusted for quality) following major price&#13;
increases during the last quarter of 1993.  In addition, coal mine operating&#13;
subsidies have been eliminated, except for those mines that are being closed&#13;
down.   Coal export controls have been suspended. As of September 1, 1994,&#13;
electricity prices for industry and households were at about 61% and 51% of their&#13;
estimated economic levels, respectively. The average residential price is about&#13;
138% of the average industrial price (less than 50% in early 1990). The average&#13;
gas price for industry is now at 100% of its economic level. The gas price for&#13;
households is at 61% of its economic level; it is now at about 140% of the price&#13;
for industry (16% in early 1990). District heating contract prices have moved&#13;
to about 63% of their economic level and the Government reduced subsidies to&#13;
households from 78% in 1991 to about 10% as of January 1, 1995. These subsidies&#13;
have already been eliminated in many major cities and are expected to be&#13;
eliminated in most of the country by the end of 1996.&#13;
14.   Given that the SECAL's pricing conditionality was met, the Bank and the&#13;
Government started a policy dialogue on how to proceed with price adjustment from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
here on to ensure that energy prices would reach economic levels.   A key factor&#13;
in the Government's decision-making process about energy pricing should be the&#13;
fact that most of the resources for the energy sector's huge investment needs&#13;
would have to be generated domestically. Given the scarcity of budget funds, as&#13;
well as for reasons of economic efficiency, these would have to come from the&#13;
sector's internal cash flow and from borrowing. Foreign direct investment also&#13;
has a vital role to play, but such capital, as well as internal and external&#13;
borrowings, will only be forthcoming if there is a transparent regulatory&#13;
framework and if energy prices are allowed to fully reflect economic costs.&#13;
d. Energy Regulatory Framework&#13;
15.   The Government has prepared a draft energy law for presentation to the&#13;
Parliament. This law would set up the future energy regulatory framework and&#13;
establish the Energy Regulatory Agency. As it stands, the draft provides for&#13;
competition in the network fuel subsectors and for open access to new entrants.&#13;
The Energy Regulatory Agency would have adequate autonomy, subject to overall&#13;
accountability to the Council of Ministers.  The draft law is expected to be&#13;
submitted to Parliament in the Fall of 1995. The Bank/ESMAP will cooperate with&#13;
the drafting of secondary legislation, permits, licenses, statutes and training&#13;
of personnel for the future Energy Regulatory Agency.&#13;
C. Power Sector&#13;
a. Organization&#13;
16.   The power sector underwent substantial demonopolization and divestiture.&#13;
Until September 1990 it consisted of 106 enterprises combined in the Power and&#13;
Lignite Board.  Upon dissolution of the Power and Lignite Board, all service&#13;
enterprises were spun off into joint stock companies. The sector now consists&#13;
of 68 autonomous enterprises specialized in the generation, transmission and&#13;
distribution of electricity. There are 34 thermal power and combined heat and&#13;
power generating enterprises; 33 distribution enterprises, who also own 113 small&#13;
hydro plants and one pumped storage plant; and one transmission company (PPGC)&#13;
which also owns four pumped storage plants.&#13;
17.   Electricity dispatching is done by PPGC, which is moving towards a merit&#13;
order dispatching system. It has set separate capacity and energy charges and&#13;
has curtailed its power purchases from more expensive generators.  These are&#13;
vital steps towards a new system, with major implications for both efficient as&#13;
well as inefficient producers. Equally importantly, power purchase agreements&#13;
are now being introduced. These elements constitute the corner stones of an open&#13;
and competitive power sector (para. 33).&#13;
18.   Through its national dispatch center and five regional dispatch centers,&#13;
PPGC maintains optimum electricity supply and transmission efficiency and&#13;
reliability, and manages international power exchanges and transits (para 46).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
b. Generation&#13;
19.   As of the end of 1993, the Polish power sector had an installed capacity&#13;
of 32,750 MW0; 90% of this belongs to the power industry and 10% to industrial&#13;
auto-producers. The power industry generates most of its electricity through&#13;
thermal power plants (condensing units: 22,078 MW9, combined heat and power&#13;
units: 5,353 MW.) and the remaining 2,007 MWe through hydropower plants. In&#13;
addition to electricity generation, the power industry supplies heat to district&#13;
heating networks in fifty major cities. Its total available thermal capacity is&#13;
about 26,940 MWt, of which 11,435 MWt in CHP units and 15,505 MWt in large HOBs.&#13;
On average, CHP plants account for 66% of the power sector's total heat&#13;
production, but for only 10% of total electricity generation. Thus, while CHP&#13;
is crucial to heat supply, it constitutes still a relatively small portion of&#13;
electric power production. This situation should be reversed over time, since&#13;
increased use of CHP is energy efficient, relatively non-polluting, and increases&#13;
heat network dispatchability.&#13;
20.    Generating capacity is designed primarily for burning hard coal (66%) and&#13;
lignite (28%), while the remaining 6% is provided by hydro plants. About 39% of&#13;
the energy generated by the sector is produced by lignite-fired plant, 52% by&#13;
coal-fired plant, 3% by hydro plant and 6% by individual autoproducers. However,&#13;
up to half of the electricity currently purchased by PPGC during peak season is&#13;
produced by the large lignite generators. Implementation of the power tariff&#13;
study's recommendations should ensure that the true costs of lignite and its&#13;
environmental impact are adequately reflected. Coal-fired thermal power plant&#13;
are designed to operate under base load rather than cyclical conditions. They&#13;
have the ability to turn down to approximately 80% of rated output.  However,&#13;
because of the mix of generating plant within the system, i.e., CHP operating as&#13;
base load during the winter and not subject to merit order dispatch, together&#13;
with very limited peaking capacity comprising principally pumped storage plants,&#13;
the thermal generating units are obliged to operate under a reduced two shift&#13;
operation mode or be completely shut down, especially during the low demand&#13;
period in summer. This situation should change over time, as older base load&#13;
capacity is retired and as operationally more flexible power plants are&#13;
introduced.   The latter could be either through the use of gas turbines for&#13;
peaking or through thermal generating plants with the ability to turn down to 40%&#13;
of rated output. However, increased use of CHP will remain necessary for more&#13;
cost-effective and efficient heat generation compared to using polluting and&#13;
inefficient local heat-only-boilers.&#13;
21.   The Polish power system has many units which have passed their design life.&#13;
By 1998, when new emission standards go into effect, 17% of capacity will have&#13;
an average age of about 35 years; 47% of capacity will be about 29 years old.&#13;
Poor instrumentation and automation control and the use of high ash coal are&#13;
other factors contributing to a low average plant availability of 75-85%,&#13;
compared to 85-90% for Western Europe (including scheduled maintenance). Poland&#13;
has currently no nuclear generating capacity and none is planned.&#13;
c. Transmission and Distribution&#13;
22.   The Polish high voltage transmission grid comprises four voltage levels:&#13;
750, 400, 220 and 110 kV.  The 750 kV line was completed in 1984, the 400 kV&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
system in 1964 and the 220 kV system in 1952. The 110 kV system is much older&#13;
and is in some areas in significant need of rehabilitation. Most CHP plants are&#13;
integrated into the 110 kV network. The 110 kV network currently operates on an&#13;
interconnected basis throughout the country with the exception of the Katowice&#13;
area, where it is sectionalized in order to limit fault levels.  Most of the&#13;
large generators (200 MW unit rating) are connected to the 220 kV network, which&#13;
represents a partial overlay of the existing 110 kV system. The 400 kV system&#13;
originally played a limited role. When established its principal function was&#13;
power wheeling, particularly from the Ukraine to the Czech Republic, and power&#13;
exchange with the former East Germany. During recent years the 400 kV system was&#13;
further developed to permit bulk power transfer within the country. However,&#13;
neither the 400 kV nor the 220 kV systems adequately offload the 110 kV system.&#13;
This results in significant losses in the 110 kV system as it must fulfill the&#13;
dual roles of subtransmission and distribution system.&#13;
23.   Medium and low voltage networks are poorly designed and obsolete in some&#13;
places, lack connecting and safety devices, and need major rehabilitation.&#13;
Transmission and distribution losses in Poland average over 14%, compared to 7-8%&#13;
in Western European countries of comparable size. About 85% of these losses are&#13;
in distribution networks.   PPGC's proposed investment program, of which the&#13;
proposed project is an integral part, would offload the underlying networks and&#13;
transport power on a much more efficient basis, resulting in a reduction in power&#13;
losses of about 120 GWh/year.&#13;
24.   Various studies were undertaken to determine the optimal sequencing for&#13;
transmission system investments: (a) a UCPTE study, which provides an assessment&#13;
of the transmission modernization and reinforcement required to permit&#13;
interconnection with Western Europe; and (b) a long-term power system development&#13;
study (para. 68), which defines network configuration to the year 2010. Both&#13;
studies identified transmission projects needed in the immediate future that both&#13;
meet the long-term development needs of the system and that satisfy the&#13;
requirements of UCPTE and which are typical of requirements that any power system&#13;
should meet to have secure and efficient system operations. These projects are&#13;
part of PPGC's proposed investment program. More detail on the power sector and&#13;
the current network condition is provided in Annexes 2-2 and 2-3.&#13;
d. Power Demand&#13;
25.   Electricity demand increased at 2.2% per annum during 1980-88 and peaked&#13;
at 149 TWh in 1988.   Since then it decreased to 131 TWh in 1993.  The gross&#13;
reserve margin of the system is about 25-30%, typical for a thermal system.&#13;
However, since the winter peaks are pronounced in Poland, during the remainder&#13;
of the year the margins may go up to 40-50%.&#13;
26.   The future demand for electricity depends not only on economic growth but&#13;
also on the combined effects of structural changes in the economy and measures&#13;
to enhance energy conservation and efficiency. The complexity of the transition&#13;
towards a market economy, the uncertainty about the pace of implementation of&#13;
structural reform and the impact of continuous energy price adjustments have made&#13;
the preparation of a reliable medium term electricity demand forecast very&#13;
difficult.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27.   Since  1991,  various  Polish  and  foreign  agencies  have  carried  out&#13;
electricity demand forecasts using different methods.   For example,  demand&#13;
forecasts prepared by the Paris-based International Energy Agency and the Polish&#13;
Ministry of Industry and Trade were carried out by following mainly the&#13;
traditional income elasticity approach, while other demand forecasts by Polish&#13;
research institutes were prepared with additional technical, microeconomic and&#13;
population variables as determinants.   Despite the differences in focus and&#13;
methods, these forecasts generally agree on the trend of the future electricity&#13;
demand.   Most predict slightly decreasing demand through 1994 and gradually&#13;
increasing demand thereafter.&#13;
28.   In addition to the above PPGC, in cooperation with foreign consultants,&#13;
recently also prepared a demand forecast using the current assessment of&#13;
macroeconomic developments.   Three scenarios of electricity demand, based on&#13;
alternative GDP growth scenarios (high, medium and low growth), were used. The&#13;
low GDP growth scenario was chosen as the base case both for the least cost&#13;
investment plan (para. 68) as well as for the power tariff study (para. 58). It&#13;
estimates that electricity demand through 1994 would remain at the 1990 level,&#13;
and that demand between 1995 and 2000 would grow at approximately 2.5% per annum.&#13;
This appears realistic, in view of the Bank's own assumption of an annual GDP&#13;
growth rate of about 5% starting in 1995 and consumer elasticity of demand in&#13;
response to further price increases.   Therefore, this scenario has also been&#13;
retained for the financial and economic calculations in this report.&#13;
e. Power Sector Restructuring&#13;
29.   Mergers.   Conform the Government's 1991 letter of sector development&#13;
policy, the existing 34 generating enterprises would be regrouped into a smaller&#13;
number of joint stock companies. The merger criteria would be competitiveness&#13;
and financial viability. The hard coal-fired generating plants would be grouped&#13;
into a maximum of four companies  (representing about 4,000 MW each).   The&#13;
lignite-fired power plants and their adjacent lignite mines would be combined&#13;
into three generating companies. The lignite-fired plants would have capacities&#13;
of 4300 MW, 2500 MW and 2000 MW, respectively. Additionally, there would be 19&#13;
CHP companies.&#13;
30.   The number of distribution companies would remain at the present 33.  Six&#13;
of these would serve a minimum of 150,000 consumers, and 27 would serve more than&#13;
200,000 customers each. It was felt that the current size of the distribution&#13;
companies was appropriate and that the benefits of mergers would be far&#13;
outweighed by the costs, including loss of contact with customers. In addition,&#13;
the current bulk tariff structure for distributors virtually ensures that prices&#13;
for end-users would probably not vary by more than 20% throughout the country.&#13;
31.   Energy Law and Regulatory Framework.   It is expected that the proposed&#13;
energy law (para. 15) would notably: (a) create an independent Energy Regulatory&#13;
Agency; (b) allow the existence of different forms of ownership; (c) encourage&#13;
competition within generation; (d) reduce the natural monopoly within&#13;
transmission and distribution by applying third party access rules; and (e)&#13;
mandate integrated resource planning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
32.   The Energy Regulatory Agency would be an autonomous body.   While the&#13;
natural monopoly parts of the industry would continue to be regulated, there&#13;
would be considerable scope for managerial independence within a structure that&#13;
combines appropriate price controls with efficiency incentives. The preliminary&#13;
thinking is that prices charged by the transmission company (bulk tariff) would&#13;
be regulated on a cost basis. The prices charged by the distribution companies,&#13;
and by the generators in medium term contracts, would be regulated on the basis&#13;
of standardized costs. The prices in long-term generation contracts would result&#13;
from competitive bidding. The prices in short term and spot contracts would be&#13;
set by competition rather than regulation. Nevertheless, initial market rules&#13;
would provide that the regulatory agency would have the option of investigating&#13;
these prices under certain circumstances. Therefore, the cost-based regulated&#13;
market share would be declining.&#13;
33.   Electricity Market.       Under the emerging electricity market framework&#13;
designed by PPGC in cooperation with consultants, long term (up to 20 years)&#13;
power purchase agreements are now being signed between PPGC and the generators&#13;
for 80% of each generator's output.  About 15-20% of each generator's output&#13;
would be sold to PPGC under short-term (up to 1 year) power purchase agreements.&#13;
In the long run, about 5% could possibly be sold on a daily (spot market) basis,&#13;
if such a system is manageable. The short-term and daily contracts would have&#13;
higher profit margins than the long-term contracts, in order to compensate for&#13;
uncertainty. PPGC would sign contracts with all generators connected to the 220&#13;
and 400 kV network. Generators connected to the 110 kV network would have the&#13;
option to sign contracts either with PPGC or directly with the distribution&#13;
companies.&#13;
34.   These agreements would establish the provisions under which PPGC would&#13;
purchase the capacity and the energy generated at each plant, including price&#13;
levels and adjustment provisions, guaranteed quantities and conditions of&#13;
metering and supply. The model long-term power purchase agreement was developed&#13;
in cooperation with the Bank and USAID.   Such agreements are of paramount&#13;
importance to investors and lenders, since under limited recourse financing only&#13;
the revenues associated with the availability of capacity and the sale of power&#13;
are available to cover debt service payments and dividends. Payments are divided&#13;
between capacity and energy charges. Capacity charges cover all fixed costs,&#13;
including debt service and depreciation. In return, the generators guarantee the&#13;
plant's availability under safe running conditions, with bonus and penalty&#13;
provisions as appropriate. The energy charges cover the variable portion of the&#13;
costs associated with power generation and a profit margin.&#13;
35.   In the case of a CHP plant, a thermal purchase agreement would need to be&#13;
signed between the local heat distribution enterprise and the generator.   In&#13;
substance this agreement would be similar to the power sales agreement. Because&#13;
the main issue is the allocation of total cost between heat and power, the two&#13;
agreements would normally be negotiated virtually simultaneously.&#13;
36.   Separate grid charges would be established, on the basis of which supply&#13;
competition could develop over time. Access to transmission and distribution&#13;
networks would be open to competing power sources, including independent power&#13;
producers. Franchising, under which one company would operate the system but the&#13;
assets themselves would be owned by another company, would be another possible&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
way of enhancing efficiency within distribution.   This option is currently&#13;
favored over the concession option, under which one company owns and operates the&#13;
assets for an extended period of time.&#13;
D. Environmental Aspects&#13;
37.   Energy production and consumption represent the single most serious threat&#13;
to the environment in Poland. However, the substantial increases in domestic&#13;
energy prices since 1990 are beginning to provide incentives for energy&#13;
conservation and for fuel switching away from coal.    Since  1989,  energy&#13;
consumption fell by 21%; emissions decreased by more than 30%.   In heavily&#13;
industrialized areas emissions reductions are even more significant. This has&#13;
also affected the levels of ambient air pollution.   Apart from some highly&#13;
polluted areas, average levels of exposure in Poland to the major air pollutants&#13;
are no longer significantly higher than in industrialized countries in Western&#13;
Europe.&#13;
38.   Particulates (soot, dust) and not S02 and/or NO. are the most serious type&#13;
of pollution in Poland, both in terms of health impact as well as economic costs.&#13;
Therefore, the most significant improvements in environmental quality can be&#13;
achieved by control of emissions from "low stack" boilers. Removal of sulfur&#13;
dioxide by means of expensive flue gas desulfurization (FGD) in high stacks&#13;
should, at this time, be limited to new plants and/or at locations where the&#13;
greatest impact on ambient air quality and transboundary pollution can be&#13;
demonstrated,  and where FGD is the least-cost solution.   Although Poland's&#13;
contribution to transboundary pollution is considerable, the country is a net&#13;
importer of S02 and possibly N0O.&#13;
39.   The Government has expressed its intention to move  towards  adopting&#13;
European Union standards, and has introduced new emission standards that should&#13;
become effective starting January 1, 1998.  While the emission standards are&#13;
reasonable, with the exception of the timing of the introduction of the S02&#13;
standard, the proposed ambient standards are much stricter than comparable&#13;
standards in the European Union. Uncertainty about how the emission standards&#13;
will be interpreted and the future dispatching strategy (para. 57), combined with&#13;
a lack of investment funds, makes it difficult for generating enterprises to plan&#13;
any environmental investments that may be required. This virtually ensures that&#13;
the standards cannot be enforced by 1998. The Bank is engaged in a dialogue with&#13;
the Government on setting realistic and enforceable standards that are driven by&#13;
the need to achieve a healthy ambient air quality. In setting ambient standards,&#13;
cost-benefit analyses of the damage caused by different pollution levels and the&#13;
costs of reducing emissions would need to be carried out. Emission standards&#13;
should then be designed to ensure that the desired ambient standards are met.&#13;
The Government agreed that it will review its air pollution emission standards&#13;
for the power s6ctor by December 31, 1995 and promptly thereafter: (a) revise&#13;
these standards to ensure: (i) compliance with international treaties and&#13;
protocols; (ii) consistency with EU emission standards; and (iii) unambiguous&#13;
interpretation of such standards; and (b) ensure compliance by the power sector&#13;
with such standards on a least-cost basis. Such standards should be based on the&#13;
need to achieve a healthy ambient air quality and on the premise that power&#13;
plants should contribute their fair share in reaching that target.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
40.   Economic instruments (as opposed to the regulatory approach) are becoming&#13;
increasingly important as a tool of pollution control policy. They also create&#13;
incentives for energy conservation and environmental improvement.  In Poland, a&#13;
number of these instruments, like emissions charges, are already in place. Other&#13;
instruments, such as the bubble concept and tradeable permits, are under&#13;
consideration. It would be desirable for these instruments to become part of&#13;
future air pollution regulations. The Bank has cooperated with the Government&#13;
in this respect through a study and subsequent seminar on alternative policy&#13;
instruments for the control of air pollution, funded by the UK Know How Fund.&#13;
E. Bank Sector Assistance Strategy&#13;
41.   The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy as discussed&#13;
by the Board of Directors during the presentation of the Katowice Heat Supply and&#13;
Conservation Project on November 17, 1994 and according to which the Bank would&#13;
aim at: (i) assisting the Government in addressing the most critical structural&#13;
issues (public finance reform, downsizing of large loss-making sectors and&#13;
financial  sector  reform);  (ii)  supporting  private  sector  development  and&#13;
catalyzing private sector financing or participation; and (iii) financing medium-&#13;
sized projects in social and economic infrastructure with increased emphasis on&#13;
projects at the local government level. The Bank's strategy in the energy sector&#13;
envisages projects that support priority rehabilitation and modernization&#13;
investments in the power, district heating and gas subsectors that enhance energy&#13;
conservation and efficiency and reduce environmental pollution.   In the coal&#13;
subsector the Bank aims to assist the Government's downsizing efforts by helping&#13;
to mitigate the social cost of restructuring.&#13;
42.   Under the Energy Resource Development project (Loan 3215-POL) the Bank&#13;
supports gas pricing reform; domestic production of gas; and increased private&#13;
sector participation in developing petroleum resources.   Under the SAL (Loan&#13;
3247-POL), coal prices were decontrolled and the first steps were taken towards&#13;
elimination of energy-related subsidies and cross-subsidization of household&#13;
energy consumers. Under the Heat Supply Restructuring and Conservation Project&#13;
(Loans 3377/83-POL), in particular the SECAL of that project (Loan 3377-POL), and&#13;
under the Katowice Heat Supply and Conservation Project (Loan 3809-POL), the Bank&#13;
broadened and deepened its support for further comprehensive energy sector&#13;
restructuring.   While good progress has been made on energy pricing,  the&#13;
Government and the Bank are engaged in a policy dialogue about the additional&#13;
measures needed to bring energy prices to their economic levels and to introduce&#13;
the new regulatory framework (paras. 14-15).&#13;
43.   Further industrial and household energy price adjustments will be necessary&#13;
for energy sector enterprises to be able to finance an adequate portion of&#13;
investments from net cash flow; accelerate energy conservation and efficiency&#13;
improvements (in industry but also in households); enable increased domestic gas&#13;
production and gas imports; encourage fuel switching and introduction of clean&#13;
coal technologies to reduce environmental pollution; and create one essential&#13;
precondition for attracting much needed private capital to the sector.   The&#13;
relatively greater adjustment effort will need to be focused on bringing&#13;
household prices further in line with economic levels. This is also particularly&#13;
important for the distribution companies.  However, the Bank recognizes that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
special measures should be taken to protect the lowest income groups through&#13;
measures that do not encourage excessive use of energy.&#13;
44.   In preparing this project, the lessons learned in past power projects in&#13;
other Regions as recorded by the Operations Evaluations Department were applied.&#13;
Special emphasis was put on ensuring that all preparatory work necessary for&#13;
project implementation was done prior to loan effectiveness. Furthermore, the&#13;
project takes place within the framework of the continuing policy dialogue with&#13;
the Government regarding the energy sector restructuring program, particularly&#13;
as it relates to achieving further improvement in energy pricing policies,&#13;
introduction of a sound regulatory framework and integrated resource planning&#13;
(para. 66). This is consistent with the principal recommendations of the Bank's&#13;
1992 Energy Sector Policy Paper.&#13;
PART III - THE BORROWER&#13;
A. Organization&#13;
45.   The Polish Power Grid Company (PPGC) would be the Borrower of the Bank&#13;
loan. PPGC was created as a joint stock company on August 2, 1990, just prior&#13;
to the dissolution of the Power and Lignite Board monopoly on September 30, 1990.&#13;
All PPGC shares are held by the Treasury, represented by the Ministry of Industry&#13;
and Trade. PPGC has a Supervisory Council of 11 persons appointed for a period&#13;
of three years. The Council is chaired by the Vice Minister of Industry and&#13;
Trade. PPGC has a two-tier management structure, consisting of a four-member&#13;
Board of Directors (senior management) which is appointed for three year terms&#13;
by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and the Management, consisting of the&#13;
various department heads. The organization chart of PPGC is shown in Annex 3-1.&#13;
46.   PPGC has the following main responsibilities within the Polish power&#13;
sector: (a) manage power grid operation, taking into account considerations of&#13;
economy and safety; (b) set the rules for the domestic wholesale electricity&#13;
market; (c) export and import electricity; (d) ensure adequate fuel stock&#13;
management; and (e) develop the least-cost investment program for the Polish&#13;
power sector as a whole.   In addition, PPGC has assumed a major role in&#13;
developing detailed policy recommendations for sector restructuring and for the&#13;
functioning of a new domestic wholesale electricity market (para. 33).&#13;
47.   In August 1993 the high-voltage transmission assets (covering all lines and&#13;
substation equipment at the 750, 400 and 220 kV levels, plus interface equipment&#13;
at the 110 kV level) and four major pumped storage facilities were transferred&#13;
from the distribution companies to PPGC. These assets are indispensable for PPGC&#13;
to exercise its dispatching function and for coordinated investment planning.&#13;
Details on the assets transfer are provided in Annex 3-2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
B. Staff and Training&#13;
48.   As of the end of 1994, PPGC had a staff of 1,527 persons of which 484 were&#13;
employed at headquarters in Warsaw (including the National Dispatching Center)&#13;
and the remaining 1;043 in the five regional branches. Salaries and wages paid&#13;
by PPGC are competitive with the remainder of the industry. The structure of&#13;
compensation offers adequate incentives, the ratio between highest and lowest&#13;
wages being in the order of 12:1. There are two trade unions active within PPGC:&#13;
Solidarity (about 210 members) and the Dispatchers Union (about 250 members).&#13;
Relations between management and the trade unions are satisfactory.&#13;
49.   PPGC's staff is generally well qualified in technical matters.  Out of the&#13;
1,527 people employed, 744 have university degrees.   About 78Z of those are&#13;
engineers, while economists account for virtually all of the remaining staff with&#13;
advanced degrees. Shortcomings are now beginning to be felt keenly in the areas&#13;
of finance, investment management, and in legal matters.&#13;
50.   In the past, training was provided on a department by department basis,&#13;
with the department director identifying training needs of his staff.   However,&#13;
in 1993 a new personnel section was established with the specific task of setting&#13;
up a data base of the staff, including performance appraisals and employee self-&#13;
assessments. These data were used to determine the best fit of current personnel&#13;
to available positions, identify the need for new employees, and establish&#13;
training programs. The analysis indicated a need for additional staff training&#13;
and, as a result, PPGC tripled training expenditures.&#13;
51.   Three  departments  are  currently  involved  in financial  and  economic&#13;
management:  the Accounting,  the Economic and the Finance Departments.   The&#13;
Accounting Department is responsible for financial reporting, settling accounts&#13;
between PPGC and the generators and distributors, and cash transactions.  The&#13;
Economics Department is mainly responsible for designing and calculating retail&#13;
prices and internal transfer prices among the three subsectors in the power&#13;
industry, and for contracting between PPGC and other entities (generators,&#13;
distributors, coal mines, import/export). The Finance Department was established&#13;
in 1993 in recognition of the need for PPGC to meet the demands of a modern&#13;
commercial utility in a market economy. The main responsibilities of the Finance&#13;
Department are financial management and corporate financial planning, which had&#13;
been almost non-existent in PPGC until the Finance Department was created. As&#13;
it is gradually strengthened these functions would play an increasingly important&#13;
role in PPGC's financial management.&#13;
52.   However, further restructuring of the economics and finance complex should&#13;
take place. Considering the tasks that PPGC will need to carry out in overall&#13;
power sector restructuring and in implementing its own investments, it would be&#13;
desirable to establish a centralized financial management system under a Chief&#13;
Financial Officer reporting to the Executive Board of PPGC.  Under the Chief&#13;
Financial Officer the following principal functions should be performed:&#13;
management accounting, corporate planning, budgeting and budgetary control,&#13;
financial accounting, cost accounting, and internal control and auditing. Part&#13;
of the proceeds of the Bank loan would be used for staff training in these areas.&#13;
Agreement was reached that PPGC will present, by June 30, 1996 a comprehensive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
proposal, satisfactory to the Bank, to introduce a sound corporate financial&#13;
management organization and implement this by December 31, 1996.&#13;
C. Project Preparation and Implementation&#13;
53.   Due to the scarcity of investment funds in recent years, combined with the&#13;
burden of having to take a lead role in the ongoing energy sector restructuring,&#13;
PPGC had neither the need nor the opportunity to organize an adequately staffed&#13;
project preparation and implementation unit. For the few ongoing projects tasks&#13;
were generally assigned on an ad-hoc basis, although more formal arrangements&#13;
were made in connection with the Warsaw-Bialystok transmission line. Investments&#13;
during 1991-93 averaged about US$43 million per year; these investments were&#13;
started by the former Power and Lignite Board and only needed completion.&#13;
54.   However, the proposed project poses requirements that are of a different&#13;
magnitude than what PPGC has experienced so far. A large number of sub-projects,&#13;
each with its own implementation schedule, must be managed carefully in order to&#13;
ensure that they are completed on time. Among the major tasks to be done are:&#13;
scheduling, budgeting, monitoring and reporting. Some of the specific tasks are:&#13;
feasibility studies preparation, obtaining right-of-way, legal/contractual&#13;
aspects, environmental reviews, procurement, bid evaluation and contract award,&#13;
and construction supervision. Hence, PPGC has created a project preparation and&#13;
implementation unit and has assigned the staff necessary to manage all the tasks&#13;
for each sub-project, including a project manager to ensure coordination. The&#13;
size of this staff will vary, depending on the extent to which PPGC wishes to&#13;
subcontract major parts of the work to engineering design offices and the&#13;
distribution  companies.    Bank  consultants  under  Canadian  grant  financing&#13;
cooperated with PPGC in project preparation and management.&#13;
55.   Since  1990,  only  minimal  investments  have  been  undertaken  by  the&#13;
distribution companies for maintenance and rehabilitation of the 400 and 220 kV&#13;
networks, partly because of lack of funds and partly because of the planned&#13;
transfer of these assets to PPGC. The future challenge will be to ensure that,&#13;
despite separate ownership of different network components, coordinated&#13;
investment planning will take place in order to achieve the required performance&#13;
objectives  of the power network.   In this regard,  the obsolescence  of a&#13;
significant portion of the 110 kV system, along with its poor operational&#13;
performance,  is  of  primary  concern.    Therefore,  a  general  program  for&#13;
rehabilitation of the interconnected 400/220/110 kV network should be prepared,&#13;
while recognizing the unique characteristics of the 110 kV grid in each district.&#13;
This would ensure proper sequencing of investments at 400 and 220 kV levels in&#13;
conjunction with those at the 110 kV level nationwide, as well as establishment&#13;
of investment priorities at the 110 kV level on a regional basis. Agreement was&#13;
reached that PPGC will: (i) prepare, by December 31, 1996, a comprehensive&#13;
program including detailed guidelines, satisfactory to the Bank, for the&#13;
rehabilitation of the 110 kV network in conjunction with the rehabilitation of&#13;
the 400 and 220 kV networks; and (ii) issue such guidelines by June 30, 1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
D. Functions of PPGC&#13;
56.   Dispatching.    At  present  PPGC  uses  generation  loading  tables  to&#13;
economically dispatch generation.   These tables are revised periodically to&#13;
reflect changes in unit characteristics and variable costs. The latter, however,&#13;
only take the cost of fuel and transportation into account and exclude the&#13;
effects of transmission losses and environmental charges. The unit data used to&#13;
develop the loading tables are based on the incremental cost curve for each unit,&#13;
i.e., the increase in costs incurred at each loading level when the unit output&#13;
is increased by a small increment. Those units with the lowest incremental costs&#13;
are loaded first when additional generation is required. Within the constraints&#13;
of its narrow definition of costs, PPGC is currently operating -manually- a merit&#13;
order dispatching system.&#13;
57.   Transmission losses and emissions could be taken into account by adjusting&#13;
the unit incremental cost curve. For losses, the adjustment factors would depend&#13;
on the current operating state of the power system and the extent to which&#13;
additional costs are incurred in transmitting power from a given plant to the&#13;
load centers. Similarly, adjustment factors for emissions would depend on the&#13;
operating state of the unit and its emissions characteristics. These factors are&#13;
important for a more comprehensive merit order dispatching system and for&#13;
encouraging generating plant owners to make the necessary investments in&#13;
environmental retrofitting. Other issues that must still be resolved in this&#13;
connection are: incentives to be given to generators that meet or exceed the new&#13;
environmental standards prior to 1998 to offset the additional cost of the&#13;
pollution control equipment, compensating between generators that receive such&#13;
equipment as a grant and those that have to borrow, etc. Agreement was reached&#13;
that  PPGC  would  prepare,  by  December  31,  1995  a  program  to  introduce&#13;
environmentally constrained economic dispatching and implement this by June 30,&#13;
1996.&#13;
58.   Tariff Setting.  Pending the introduction of a new regulatory framework&#13;
(para. 15), PPGC is still extensively involved in tariff setting. Retail tariffs&#13;
are set by the Ministry of Finance, having received the advice of the Ministry&#13;
of Industry and Trade (which, to a large extent, relies on the advice of PPGC).&#13;
Internal transfer pricing rules are set by the Ministry of Industry and Trade,&#13;
on the advice of PPGC.   Details on the current retail and internal transfer&#13;
pricing tariff structures are in Annex 3-3.  An electricity tariff study was&#13;
commissioned by PPGC in 1992 under USAID grant financing, under terms of&#13;
reference and by consultants satisfactory to the Bank. The study was completed&#13;
towards the end of 1993 and is instrumental in the ongoing restructuring of&#13;
electricity tariffs.&#13;
59.   Fuels Management.  Under its statute, PPGC is obliged to assist generators,&#13;
if necessary,  in keeping adequate supplies of fuel in stock.   Its National&#13;
Dispatching Center sets the standards in this regard. At present, the sector&#13;
operates without an operating permit system for generators; such a system is&#13;
expected to be introduced under the new Energy Law. Permits to operate would&#13;
stipulate the fuel reserve levels to be maintained by each generator.&#13;
Alternatively, the required fuel reserve level for a generator could be specified&#13;
in the long-term sales contract between the generator and PPGC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
60.   The current standards are that minimum reserve levels must range from 10&#13;
days of operation for plants near the mines, to 45 days for the plants that are&#13;
farthest away. In the latter case, higher reserve levels are necessary due to&#13;
potential transportation problems during winter. The National Dispatching Center&#13;
monitors fuel reserve levels for all system generators and large CHP plants on&#13;
a daily basis. The financial costs implied by these fuel requirements are among&#13;
the cost elements reflected in the variable charge paid by PPGC to each&#13;
generator.&#13;
61.   ExRort and Import of Electricity.   Although exports  and imports  of&#13;
electricity constitute a minor share of total Polish power consumption, this&#13;
function is important from the points of view of security of supply, reduction&#13;
of generating and investment costs, and expo-rt revenues.  Imports and exports&#13;
peaked at about 8.5% of total domestic consumption in 1988 and 1990,&#13;
respectively. Important changes have taken place in recent years: (a) imports&#13;
as a percentage of total domestic consumption have steadily declined from 8.4%&#13;
in 1988 to 4.3% in 1993; (b) exports as a percentage of total domestic&#13;
consumption increased from 5.4% in 1988 to 8.5% in 1990 and then decreased to&#13;
6.1% in 1993; and (c) net electricity trade has shifted from a deficit to a&#13;
surplus since 1990, increased annually since then to 3.1% of domestic consumption&#13;
1992 and decreased to 1.8% in 1993. These changes are illustrated in Table 3.1.&#13;
62.   Most electricity imports go currently to border regions which are not yet&#13;
fully connected to the Polish main transmission network. Imports from the FSU&#13;
peaked in 1989 at 7.7 TWh and declined rapidly thereafter to 1.0 TWh in 1990.&#13;
Most imports are currently from Germany. Except for a long-term export contract&#13;
with Austria, which accounted for about 60% of annual exports in recent years,&#13;
most exports are to meet short term contracts, and the export quantities vary&#13;
according to the supply/demand situations of both domestic and international&#13;
electricity markets.&#13;
63.   Given the rapidly changing demand and supply situation, it is in Poland's&#13;
interest to reinforce its domestic network, in part to be able to connect to the&#13;
UCPTE network. This could supply Poland with cheaper peaking power and enhance&#13;
security of supply while, at the same time, enabling it to trade electricity with&#13;
Western Europe. In addition to joining the UCPTE pool, Poland can still maintain&#13;
its east-west wheeling power function through asynchronous ties with the FSU's&#13;
power systems.&#13;
64.   Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, and Hungary have long operated an&#13;
interconnected power system (Centrel), with a central dispatching office located&#13;
in Prague. A working group has been set up between these countries in order to:&#13;
(a) coordinate joint operation of their power systems; (b) achieve joint&#13;
connection  to  UCPTE;  and  (c)  achieve  a  synchronous  UCPTE-Centrel-Turkey&#13;
connection once UCPTE standards have been reached.  In October 1993, the four&#13;
countries successfully completed a test of the interconnection and synchronous&#13;
operation of their networks without ties to the FSU and German networks. The&#13;
test was in full compliance with UCPTE operating criteria.&#13;

65.   Least-Cost Investment Planning.   One of PPGC's major functions is to&#13;
undertake least-cost generation and transmission investment planning for the&#13;
entire power sector (para. 68). The current period of relatively low electricity&#13;
demand provides an ideal opportunity for implementing an aggressive generating&#13;
plant retirement,  rehabilitation and modernization program.   Because of the&#13;
expected low demand growth, any new plant construction would be a function of the&#13;
retirement program. Retirements are in turn determined by the age and technical&#13;
condition of the existing units, rehabilitation and environmental requirements,&#13;
and availability of a competitive primary fuel mix. Details on the least-cost&#13;
power generation investment program are provided in Annex 3-4.&#13;
E. Integrated Resource Planning&#13;
66.   During project preparation the Bank and PPGC, under USAID, Austrian and&#13;
French grant financing, initiated a program aimed at encouraging an economically&#13;
more efficient allocation of power sector resources.   This program covered&#13;
supply-side resource planning at generation, transmission and distribution levels&#13;
and demand-side resource planning (measures for modifying the timing and level&#13;
of consumer demand).   The activities undertaken include:  (a)  load demand&#13;
forecasting; (b) assessment of demand-side management potential at the national&#13;
level and for a pilot area covered by the Gliwice and Torun electricity&#13;
distribution  companies;  (c)  least-cost  power  generation  and  transmission&#13;
investment planning (para. 68); (d) optimization of cogeneration development; (e)&#13;
economic dispatching under environmental constraints; (f) electricity transfer&#13;
pricing and retail tariffs; and (g) power system analysis.  These activities were&#13;
carried out by PPGC in cooperation with Polish institutes and local and foreign&#13;
consultants.&#13;
67.   All the above  studies have been completed.   As a result,  PPGC has&#13;
established a basic in-house integrated resource planning capacity to carry out&#13;
these activities on a regular basis and to enable it to effectively supervise&#13;
consultants in this field.   Funds have been allocated under the technical&#13;
assistance component of the proposed loan to help PPGC achieve this objective.&#13;
Funding for implementation of the demand-side management study's recommendations,&#13;
which is the responsibility of the distribution companies is envisaged, inter&#13;
alia, under the Bank's proposed Electricity Distribution Project (FY96).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
68.   The Bank arranged Austrian and French grant financing for consultants to&#13;
work with PPGC in preparing a least-cost generation and transmission investment&#13;
program  to  identify investment priorities  in the sector.    Of particular&#13;
importance was the need for dual optimization of power and heat systems. A CHP&#13;
development study was also undertaken.   The major focus of the study was to&#13;
identify units for retirement, rehabilitation and environmental retrofitting, and&#13;
to determine the economic dispatching strategy with environmental constraints,&#13;
needs for new generating capacity, optimum future capacity structure given the&#13;
fuel supply mix, and optimum development of the transmission grid. The study was&#13;
completed in November 1994.    A master plan study for telecommunications and&#13;
telecontrol of the Polish power system, including Supervisory Control And Data&#13;
Acquisition and Energy Management Systems, was also prepared.&#13;
PART IV - THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives and Scope&#13;
69.   Objectives.   The project's objectives are to: (a) improve the reliability&#13;
of the existing high voltage grid through rehabilitation and reinforcement; (b)&#13;
enhance security of power supply in Poland by interconnecting the Polish power&#13;
grid with that of Western Europe, thus improving Poland's power trade and&#13;
wheeling capability; (c) improve the network's operational performance and&#13;
control through transmission loss reduction and improved dispatching, thereby&#13;
enhancing energy conservation and efficiency; (d) reduce environmental pollution;&#13;
and (e) enhance PPGC's institutional capabilities.   The project takes place&#13;
within the framework of the continuing policy dialogue with the Government&#13;
regarding the energy sector restructuring program, particularly as it relates to&#13;
achieving further improvement in energy pricing policies and introduction of a&#13;
sound regulatory framework.&#13;
70.   Project Scope.   The project, supported by a US$160 million Bank loan,&#13;
comprises the following major components:&#13;
a.    the  substation  modernization  program,  consisting  of:  (i)  the&#13;
modernization of strategic substations in the Western and Central-&#13;
Western regions of Poland (including a complete upgrading and&#13;
modernization of the major substation Mikulowa) to meet the design&#13;
performance levels required for system reliability and international&#13;
interconnections; and (ii) shunt reactive compensation at specific&#13;
substations, to ensure steady voltage control and avoid having to&#13;
switch off 400 kV lines under light load conditions;&#13;
b.    the 220 kV line modernization program, consisting of urgently needed&#13;
rehabilitation and upgrading of 220 kV lines to achieve satisfactory&#13;
overall system performance levels and interconnect major substations&#13;
for dispatching purposes; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
c.    technical assistance in selected areas of project and financial&#13;
management, integrated resource planning and training, as required.&#13;
71.   The project is part of a larger investment program to reinforce Poland's&#13;
high voltage grid. The Bank loan would finance only the direct foreign exchange&#13;
costs of those high priority components for which procurement and implementation&#13;
can start immediately.   Not included under Bank financing are, for example,&#13;
construction of a major substation and two major new transmission lines for the&#13;
Ostrow system, due to the fact that their right-of-way acquisition and&#13;
environmental assessments are not sufficiently advanced.  A detailed project&#13;
description is provided in Annex 4-1.  The program, the project and the Bank-&#13;
financed components are presented in Annex 4-2.&#13;
72.   Satisfactory performance of the Polish power system can only be achieved&#13;
by ensuring a self-sufficient and reliable system. With respect to the power&#13;
transmission network, this involves a comprehensive medium-term program&#13;
consisting of urgently needed rehabilitation and reinforcement of existing&#13;
facilities (lines and substations), combined with a long-term functional&#13;
reconfiguration of the high voltage 400, 220 and 110 kV networks in order to&#13;
gradually allow the 110 kV network to become a distribution network only.&#13;
73.   A Poland-UCPTE  interconnection study was completed in 1993,  jointly&#13;
undertaken by PPGC and utilities from France, Germany and Sweden.  The study&#13;
formulated a comprehensive investment program that PPGC needs to undertake prior&#13;
to joining the UCPTE.  This would require significant grid outages to permit&#13;
implementation of this program in various locations of the network.   These&#13;
outages must be planned on a coordinated basis so as not to jeopardize the&#13;
electricity supply and demand balance, and in order to ensure that maximum&#13;
security is maintained at all times. Close involvement of dispatching staff and&#13;
of the generation and distribution companies concerned would be essential, both&#13;
during and after the preparation of a detailed project implementation schedule.&#13;
B. Project Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
74.   The total project cost, including interest during construction (para. 86),&#13;
taxes and duties, is estimated at about US$276 million equivalent. Of the total&#13;
cost, US$168 million would be in foreign exchange, and US$108 million equivalent&#13;
would be in local costs. All cost estimates are based on international prices&#13;
as of March 1994. A physical contingency of 10% of the base cost has been added,&#13;
plus a specific contingency to allow for the possibility of using Gas Insulated&#13;
Switchgear at the Mikulowa substation. Foreign and local price contingencies are&#13;
assumed to average 2.5% per annum. A summary of the project cost is presented&#13;
in Table 4.1.  Project cost details are in Annex 4-2.&#13;

C. Environmental Assessment&#13;
76.   The project is rated category B, in accordance the Bank's Operational&#13;
Manual Statement 4.01 of October 1992.   This category is reserved for projects&#13;
which may have relatively minor adverse environmental impacts, despite the fact&#13;
that the project would result in a net reduction in air pollution. The chief&#13;
requirement under a "B" rating is for PPGC to prepare an environmental monitoring&#13;
and mitigation plan. PPGC has done this. Audible noise within the substations&#13;
would be taken care of through noise suppression techniques as part of the&#13;
project design, based on background noise surveys already made. This meets the&#13;
requirements of an environmental mitigation plan. Monitoring of the lines for&#13;
audible noise and electric field intensity would be undertaken by PPGC as part&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
of its routine procedures. The power transformers could be a source of possible&#13;
oil leakage or fires.   Under the project provision has been made for oil&#13;
containment at the transformers for all substations, together with fire&#13;
prevention water deluge systems.&#13;
77.   PPGC is taking a pro-active environmental stance and is undertaking a study&#13;
-under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank- of possible usage of poly-&#13;
chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the 110 kV network. Although it is not known&#13;
whether PCBs were, in fact, used as a coolant in the Polish power system, it was&#13;
common in many power systems throughout the world until about ten years ago.&#13;
However, because of PCBs' high toxicity, utilities in some countries have started&#13;
to gradually replace PCBs by mineral oil. PPGC has already presented a study,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, that concluded that no PCBs are present in the 400 and&#13;
220 kV systems. Agreement was reached that PPGC would prepare, by December 31,&#13;
1995, a study on the use of PCBs for the 110 kV distribution network in Poland.&#13;
None of the equipment to be installed under the project would utilize PCBs.&#13;
78.   PPGC contacted the Polish Society for the Protection of Birds and the&#13;
Gdansk Ornithological Society, to solicit their opinion about the environmental&#13;
impact of the proposed transmission line routings that are part of its investment&#13;
program. These entities have reported favorably on the proposed transmission&#13;
line routings. Ihe lines would also be running mostly at a considerable distance&#13;
from population centers and resettlement for this component, as well as for&#13;
substation rehabilitation, would not be required.   In addition, the design of&#13;
the transmission lines and the width of the right-of-way are well within EU&#13;
standards for noise and electric field intensity.&#13;
79.   Through the project's network reinforcement and rehabilitation components,&#13;
transmission losses would be reduced and electricity dispatching improved. This&#13;
would result in a corresponding reduction in energy production by the generating&#13;
plants and would provide further incentives for the retirement of some of the&#13;
oldest and most polluting generating units. The project fits, therefore, well&#13;
in Poland's climate strategy under the Framework Convention on Climate Change,&#13;
which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as with its obligations&#13;
under the Second Sulfur Protocol. Reinforcement of the grid in the Ostrow area&#13;
would also permit the rehabilitation and full environmental retrofit of the&#13;
strategically important 2000 MWe lignite-fired Turow power plant in the south-&#13;
western part of the country.&#13;
D. Procurement Arrangements&#13;
80.   Procurement would be carried out by PPGC's procurement unit.  The unit has&#13;
qualified staff and has the necessary office equipment. The unit has received&#13;
training in international procurement by specialized Bank staff.&#13;
81.   The Bank's standard bidding documents would be used for Bank-financed&#13;
components.   To the extent practicable, invitations for bids would be grouped&#13;
into sizeable bid packages so as to enhance competition and benefit from&#13;
economies of scale in bid prices. All procurement packages valued at US$300,000&#13;
and above would be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB)&#13;
procedures in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.   In the&#13;
evaluation and comparison of bids for equipment to be procured through ICB,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Polish manufacturers would receive a domestic preference in bid evaluation of 15%&#13;
of the c.i.f. price or the prevailing customs duty applicable  to non-exempt&#13;
importers, whichever is less, provided they can prove that the value added to the&#13;
product in Poland exceeds 20% of the ex-factory bid price.  Equipment procured&#13;
through ICB would account for about 93% percent of equipment requirements&#13;
financed by the Bank, and for 49% of total equipment requirements. It consists&#13;
of 26 packages at an aggregate cost of about US$119 million.   A procurement&#13;
schedule for major equipment items is presented in  Annex 4-3. The procurement&#13;
arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3.&#13;

82.   The exceptions to ICB procurement would be as follows:&#13;
(a)   Limited International Bidding (LIB).  This procedure would be used&#13;
for equipment which is required for the replacement of existing&#13;
units and which can only be supplied by a limited number of&#13;
suppliers. It is estimated that this equipment would be procured in&#13;
2 LIB packages, not exceeding an aggregate amount of US$5.7 million.&#13;
(b)   International Shopping (IS). This procedure would be used for small&#13;
amounts  of  equipment.    Contracts  for  equipment  and  materials&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$300,000 per package, not exceeding an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$1. 2 million equivalent would be awarded under&#13;
this procedure, based on comparing price quotations obtained from at&#13;
least three eligible suppliers from at least three different&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
(c)   Direct Contracting.   This procedure would be used for items of a&#13;
proprietary nature, or where compatibility with installed equipment&#13;
is required. This would be the case for the procurement of computer&#13;
software and hardware for power system analysis. Direct contracting&#13;
would be used for equipment and materials estimated to cost an&#13;
aggregate amount not exceeding US$0.5 million equivalent and would&#13;
be financed under the technical assistance component of the project.&#13;
(d)   Consulting Services and Training.   Qualified short-listed firms&#13;
would be invited to submit proposals for consulting services and&#13;
training in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants. Contracts for consulting services would be procured&#13;
from consulting firms (estimated at US$2.5 million). As needed, the&#13;
services of individual specialists would also be contracted&#13;
(US$300,000).   In addition, an amount of US$0.5 million has been&#13;
allocated  within  the  loan  amount  for  training  purposes.    A&#13;
procurement schedule for consulting services and training, including&#13;
procurement arrangements, is presented in Annex 4-3.&#13;
83.   Retroactive Financing.  In agreement with the Bank, the Borrower is in the&#13;
process of procuring equipment to start implementing the project.   These&#13;
procurement actions would be completed in accordance with the Bank's procurement&#13;
guidelines. Payments made under such contracts after December 1, 1994 would be&#13;
eligible for reimbursement under retroactive financing arrangements up to 10% of&#13;
the loan amount (US$16.0 million).&#13;
84.   Procurement Review.   The Bank would conduct a prior review of all ICB&#13;
packages and all procurement packages over US$300,000 each. In addition, prior&#13;
approval would be sought for the use of the LIB, international shopping and&#13;
direct contracting.   Other contracts would be subject to the Bank's ex-post&#13;
reviews. In the case of consulting services and training, all terms of reference&#13;
and selection procedures would be subject to the Bank's prior review and&#13;
approval, regardless of value. In addition, prior review would be undertaken for&#13;
all consulting contracts above US$100,000 (firms) and US$50,000 (individuals).&#13;
The Bank's standard bidding documents would be used for ICB and LIB packages and&#13;
for the recruitment of consultants.&#13;
E. Disbursements&#13;
85.   The loan disbursement schedule is based on the Bank's disbursement profile&#13;
for energy projects in the Europe and Central Asia Region (Annex 4-4). The&#13;
disbursements schedule is summarized in Table 4.4.&#13;

86.   The loan would finance up to 100% of the eligible direct foreign exchange&#13;
expenditures for goods and services, as well as up to 100% of the eligible ex-&#13;
factory costs of locally produced goods. Interest during construction on the&#13;
Bank loan would also be financed from the loan, given the length of the project's&#13;
construction period and the fact the Bank loan would constitute only a modest&#13;
portion of PPGC's overall investment program financing requirements.&#13;
Disbursements for contracts valued at less than US$300,000 equivalent would be&#13;
on  the  basis  of  statements  of  expenditures  which  detail  the  individual&#13;
transactions.  The documentation to support these expenditures would be retained&#13;
by the Borrower. The documentation would be audited by independent auditors and&#13;
be made available for review by the Bank upon request.   Applications  for&#13;
withdrawals against contracts valued at more than US$300,000 equivalent would be&#13;
fully documented. To facilitate disbursements, the Borrower would establish a&#13;
Deutsche Mark (DM) denominated Special Account with a qualified commercial bank.&#13;
The initial authorized allocation of the Special Account would be DM3.0 million&#13;
and increase to DM6.0 million when aggregate withdrawals and commitments attain&#13;
US$20.0 million equivalent. Retroactive financing would be provided for up to&#13;
US$16.0 million equivalent (para. 83).&#13;
F. Implementation&#13;
87.   The project would be implemented during FY1996-2001.           The project's&#13;
completion date is expected to be June 30, 2001 and the closing date December 31,&#13;
2001. The project implementation plan is shown in Annex 4-5.&#13;
88.   The Project Account, the Special Account, the Statement of Expenditures,&#13;
and the financial statements of the Borrower would be audited at the end of each&#13;
fiscal year in accordance with international standards. Agreement was reached&#13;
with PPGC that it will appoint independent external auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Bank and present, within six months after the end of each fiscal year, audited&#13;
financial statements showing its performance and position.&#13;
89.   Systems and procedures would be set up to ensure effective monitoring of&#13;
project implementation by the Borrower and the Bank.  In particular, the Borrower&#13;
would furnish the Bank with a series of progress reports on a regular basis.&#13;
Close  attention  would  be  paid  to  the  procurement  process  and  project&#13;
implementation. The Borrower would report on selected key variables and other&#13;
statistical information that would be monitored, in order to ensure that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
efficiency gains are achieved.  Agreement was reached with PPGC that it will&#13;
submit these progress reports to the Bank by May 15 and November 15 of each year.&#13;
Agreement was also reached that PPGC will prepare and submit to the Bank, within&#13;
six months after the closing date of the loan, a project completion report.&#13;
90.   In  addition  to  regular  supervision  of  procurement  action,  project&#13;
implementation, quarterly progress reports, etc., regular supervision missions&#13;
would take place. A supervision effort averaging about 20 staffweeks per fiscal&#13;
year is expected to be required from the Bank. The supervision action plan is&#13;
shown in Annex 4-6.&#13;
91.   The project's success would be measured by such criteria as reductions in:&#13;
(i) transmission losses; (ii) widespread system disturbances; (iii) total energy&#13;
production costs; and (iv) unserved energy.&#13;
PART V -FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. Past Performance and Present Position&#13;
92.   The Polish accounting system has been substantially modified since 1992 to&#13;
conform with European Union standards. The new system, once fully implemented,&#13;
would enhance the transparency of financial transactions and make financial&#13;
accounts a far better management tool than has been the case so far.&#13;
93.   An analysis of the past financial performance of PPGC (summarized in&#13;
Table 5.1) is of limited value as a guide to its future performance due to the&#13;
fact that PPGC has been operating with a significantly larger asset base since&#13;
August 1993 (para. 47). PPGC has so far used mainly short-term borrowings, since&#13;
long-term borrowings were generally unavailable during recent years, or too&#13;
expensive. Long-term debt appeared on the books in 1993, when PPGC inherited a&#13;
small amount of debt from the distribution companies when the high voltage assets&#13;
were transferred.   In 1994 PPGC obtained an EBRD loan against the sale of&#13;
electricity export receivables.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
94.   Net internal cash generation covered a large part of total applications.&#13;
Initial investments were limited to construction of the Warsaw-Bialystok and the&#13;
Gdansk-Olsztyn transmission lines plus a small substation; these investments were&#13;
carry-overs from the period before PPGC was created (para. 53).  Starting in&#13;
1994, however, PPGC began to make significant investments in telecommunications&#13;
facilities to improve electricity dispatching. The operating and current ratios&#13;
were satisfactory.&#13;
95.   The average collection period   for accounts receivable increased from&#13;
10 days of total revenues at the end of 1992 to 36 days at the end of 1994. This&#13;
reflects the overall economic situation and the build-up of mutual arrears among&#13;
enterprises. About 80% of the accounts with billing cycles shorter than a month&#13;
(mainly industrial users) were behind in their payments, as well as 78% of the&#13;
accounts with multi-month billing cycles (mainly residential users). Though most&#13;
of these bills are paid eventually, a portion of them (equal to about 1.5-2% of&#13;
annual revenues) will never be paid.   The majority of these defaults are by&#13;
industrial firms. The increasing level of accounts receivable forced PPGC to&#13;
delay payment of accounts payable from 5 days at the end of 1991 to 29 days at&#13;
the end of 1993. The entity also had to borrow short-term to finance working&#13;
capital needs.&#13;
96.   As for the rest of the energy sector, fixed assets in the power sector were&#13;
until recently significantly undervalued.   Studies indicated that, based on&#13;
replacement value methodology, the high voltage and pumped storage assets should&#13;
be revalued by factors of at least six times.   Control of asset revaluation&#13;
indices was one of the tools used by Government to ensure that prices do not&#13;
increase too quickly. However, in the context of its review of energy pricing&#13;
policy (para. 14) the Government decided to allow energy enterprises to revalue&#13;
all assets to replacement value and to gradually reflect this in increased&#13;
depreciation charges, starting in 1995. This would lower reported profits and&#13;
corporate income taxes, thereby significantly benefitting enterprise cash flow.&#13;
&#13;

B. Financing Plan&#13;
97.   The financing plan during 1995-2001 is summarized in Table 5.2.&#13;
Table 5.2 Financing Plan. 1995 - 2001&#13;

98.   PPGC would finance 41% of total applications from net internal cash flow&#13;
during the project implementation period.  This is based on the conservative&#13;
assumption that electricity prices will neither increase nor decrease in real&#13;
terms during the period. Furthermore, due to the major change in depreciation&#13;
policy allowed by the Government (para.96) and consequent increases in&#13;
depreciation charges, net operating income would go down while cash flow would&#13;
remain adequate.   It is assumed that revenues would continue to be divided&#13;
through the internal transfer pricing system as follows: 68.0% to generation,&#13;
6.8% to transmission and 25.2% to distribution. These percentages may change as&#13;
PPGC gains more experience with the actual operating costs and investment&#13;
requirements of the high voltage system.&#13;
99.   The above scenario would enable PPGC to implement the project and its core&#13;
network reinforcement program of about US$722 million equivalent, plus certain&#13;
other investments related to further network reinforcement. It is tentatively&#13;
assumed that the Bank would favorably consider extending a loan or guarantee for&#13;
a second transmission project to help implement PPGC's investment program -&#13;
including notably the large Ostrow component- once implementation of the current&#13;
project is sufficiently advanced.&#13;
100.  PPGC's total operating expenses, excluding power purchases and depreciation&#13;
expenses, are estimated to increase at an annual rate of about 8% through 2001.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
In part this is due to the uncertainties connected with estimating the true&#13;
operating costs of the newly transferred high voltage assets.   The cost of&#13;
insurance is estimated to increase sharply as a result of asset revaluation. The&#13;
average collection period for accounts receivable is assumed to gradually decline&#13;
from 36 days in 1994 to about 20 days in 2000 and thereafter.&#13;
C. Future Financial Performance&#13;
101. Actual and forecast financial statements for 1993-2001 are shown in&#13;
Annex 5-1. The forecasts are expressed in US dollars, to eliminate the problems&#13;
associated with forecasting in an inflationary environment, combined with&#13;
changing price relationships. The main forecast financial performance indicators&#13;
are summarized in Table 5.3.&#13;

102.  PPGC' s financial performance would be satisfactory. Operating ratios would&#13;
be high due to the new depreciation policy combined with the assumption that&#13;
tariffs will not increase in real terms during the implementation period.&#13;
Nevertheless, as a result of the new depreciation policy internal cash generation&#13;
ratios would remain solid at an average of 41%, providing room for additional&#13;
investments. The debt/equity ratio would remain below 20% and the debt coverage&#13;
ratio well above 2.0 times, reflecting PPGC's underleveraged position and&#13;
capacity for future borrowings to finance additional investments.&#13;
103.  The financial performance targets are set at reasonable levels and should&#13;
be achievable under most scenarios.   Agreement was reached that PPGC will,&#13;
starting with the year 1995: (a) generate funds from internal sources sufficient&#13;
to obtain a 30% net internal cash generation ratio based on a three-year moving&#13;
average (the previous, current and next year); (b) maintain a debt service&#13;
coverage ratio of at least 1.5 times the annual debt service; and (c) present to&#13;
the Bank, by September 30 of each year, the estimated financial statements for&#13;
the current year and the forecasts for the next year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

PART VI - BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
104. The focus of the economic analysis is on the entire investment program of&#13;
PPGC.   This is mainly because the benefits associated with the investment&#13;
components under the project cannot be quantitatively measured in isolation from&#13;
other components of the program, unless arbitrary assumptions on allocating the&#13;
benefits to each component are made. The internal economic rate of return (ERR)&#13;
is, therefore, calculated on the basis of the incremental benefit and cost&#13;
streams connected with the 1995-2001 investment program, of which the Bank&#13;
project is an integral part. It covers the program's highest priority components&#13;
and is crucial for undertaking the remainder of the program. Details on the ERR&#13;
calculation are provided in Annex 6-1.&#13;
105.  Benefits.    The economic benefits associated with the entire investment&#13;
program  can  be  summarized  as  follows:  (a)  enhanced  reliability  of  the&#13;
transmission system; (b) reduced transmission losses and operation and&#13;
maintenance costs; (c) increased income from power wheeling and exports; and (d)&#13;
reduced environmental pollution.  For the purpose of the ERR calculation,  PPGC's&#13;
incremental transmission revenue is used as a proxy for the economic benefits of&#13;
its investment program and operations.&#13;
106.  Incremental transmission revenues were based on the difference between&#13;
revenues with and without the program and were valued using transmission revenue&#13;
and net export revenue. With the program, PPGC would be able to have firm power&#13;
contracts for domestic sales and exports to Austria and the Czech Republic and&#13;
maintain power exports to Germany.  Without the program, a portion of PPGC's&#13;
domestic and export contracts would be on an interruptible basis and at 50% of&#13;
the price of firm contracts; exports to Germany would cease, resulting in lost&#13;
revenues  for  the  company.    Other  quantifiable benefits made possible by&#13;
implementing the program comprise: (i) a reduction in ordered capacity by about&#13;
2% of annual peak demand per year (or 540 MW./year) valued at the marginal cost&#13;
of generation capacity of US$53/kW/year; (ii) a reduction in incremental&#13;
operating and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs estimated at 2% of the value of the&#13;
existing assets annually; and (iii) savings equivalent to about US$14 million per&#13;
year due to transmission system reinforcement resulting in reduced unsupplied&#13;
demand (during the winter period mainly), a better use of merit-order dispatching&#13;
resulting in lower generation costs, and reduced transmission losses.&#13;
107.  Costs.   The costs associated with PPGC's investment program and used for&#13;
the ERR calculation comprise: (i) the total costs of the investment program over&#13;
the period 1995-2001, excluding price contingencies, custom duties and taxes, and&#13;
interest during construction; and (ii) the corresponding annual incremental O&amp;M&#13;
costs, estimated at 2% of the cumulative capital investment costs. Other costs&#13;
such as incremental overhead costs for implementing the program were assumed to&#13;
be offset by the reduction in manpower requirements at the substation level&#13;
resulting from the improved telecommunication and telecontrol of substations.&#13;
Estimates of the local and foreign costs are in March 1994 prices. Local costs&#13;
are either directly costed in international prices or are converted to US dollars&#13;
using the average 1994 exchange rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
108.  Internal Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis.   The internal&#13;
economic rate of return, based on the benefit and cost streams discussed above,&#13;
is estimated at 21%, which is above the 12% discount rate generally applied to&#13;
Poland. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the robustness of the&#13;
ERR. The ERR would go down to 12% if investment costs were to increase by 50%,&#13;
or if all quantifiable benefits were to decrease by 40%. A combination of 20%&#13;
higher investments costs and 25% lower benefits would decrease the ERR to 12%.&#13;
The ERR is also affected, to a lesser degree, by changes in the price for&#13;
interruptible contracts: if this price increases from 50% to 90% of the price for&#13;
firm contracts, the ERR would go down to 12%.&#13;
B. Major Risks&#13;
109. The main risk associated with the project is the possibility of delayed&#13;
increases in electricity prices. Such a delay could negatively affect PPGC's&#13;
internal cash flow, needed for further system improvements. However, this risk&#13;
is manageable, given the Government's commitment to energy price reform as&#13;
demonstrated by energy pricing adjustments undertaken since 1990 and its efforts&#13;
to introduce an energy regulatory framework, combined with recent favorable&#13;
changes in asset revaluation and depreciation policy. Furthermore, the project's&#13;
cash flow is based on the conservative assumption of zero price increases in real&#13;
terms over the medium term. Price decreases in real terms are highly unlikely&#13;
over the medium term and would, in first instance, only lead to a slowing down&#13;
of the pace  of investments  and their  associated benefits.   The  risk of&#13;
procurement and implementation delays are manageable because: (a) PPGC has set&#13;
up a procurement unit that has received training from specialized Bank staff; (b)&#13;
adequate staff has been allocated to the different project management activities.&#13;
This staff could, if necessary, be assisted by consultants who would provide both&#13;
functional support as well as training under the project's technical assistance&#13;
component; and (c) tight reporting schedules on procurement and implementation&#13;
progress during supervision.&#13;
PART VIl - AGREEMENTS AND CONDITIONS&#13;
110. During negotiations, PPGC agreed to:&#13;
a.    present, by June 30, 1996 a comprehensive proposal, satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank, to introduce a sound corporate financial management&#13;
organization and implement this by December 31, 1996 (para. 52 and&#13;
Loan Agreement (LA) 4.02);&#13;
b.    (i) prepare, by December 31, 1996, a comprehensive program including&#13;
detailed   guidelines,   satisfactory   to   the   Bank,   for   the&#13;
rehabilitation of the 110 kV network in conjunction with the&#13;
rehabilitation of the 400 and 220 kV networks; and (ii) issue such&#13;
guidelines by June 30, 1997 (para. 55 and LA 3.04(a));&#13;
c.    prepare, by December 31, 1995 a program to introduce environmentally&#13;
constrained economic dispatching and implement this by June 30, 1996&#13;
(para. 57 and LA 3.04(b));&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
d.    prepare, by December 31, 1995, a study, under terms of reference&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, on the use of PCBs for the 110 kV&#13;
distribution network in Poland (para. 77 and LA 3.04(c));&#13;
e.    appoint independent external auditors acceptable to the Bank and&#13;
present, within six months after the end of each fiscal year,&#13;
audited financial statements showing its performance and position&#13;
(para. 88 and LA 5.01(b));&#13;
f.    (i) submit to the Bank, by May 15 and November 15 of each year,&#13;
progress reports; and (ii) prepare and submit to the Bank, within&#13;
six months after the closing date of the loan, a project completion&#13;
report (para. 89 and Minutes of Negotiations); and&#13;
g.    (i) generate funds from internal sources sufficient to obtain a 30%&#13;
net internal cash generation ratio based on a three-year moving&#13;
average (the previous, current and next year); (ii) maintain a debt&#13;
service coverage ratio of at least 1.5 times the annual debt&#13;
service; and (iii) present to the Bank, by September 30 of each&#13;
year, the estimated financial statements for the current year and&#13;
the forecasts for the next year (para. 103 and LA 5.02(a), 5.02(b)&#13;
and 5.03(a)).&#13;
111.  The Government agreed that it will review its air pollution emission&#13;
standards for the power sector by December 31, 1995 and promptly thereafter: (a)&#13;
revise these standards to ensure: (i) compliance with international treaties and&#13;
protocols; (ii) consistency with EU emission standards; and (iii) unambiguous&#13;
interpretation of such standards; and (b) ensure compliance by the power sector&#13;
with such standards on a least-cost basis (para. 39 and Guarantee Agreement&#13;
3.01).&#13;
112. On the basis of the above mentioned agreements, the project is considered&#13;
suitable for an IBRD loan in the amount of US$160 million equivalent for a period&#13;
of 17 years, including four years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable&#13;
interest rate. The loan would be made to the Polish Power Grid Company and would&#13;
be guaranteed by the Republic of Poland.&#13;

POLAND - POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT&#13;
National Energy Balance&#13;
1.    Economic Reform and the Energy Sector.           The Polish economy, which&#13;
contracted sharply in 1990-91 after the Economic Transformation Program was&#13;
launched in January 1990, shows signs of recovering. After a 12 % decline in&#13;
1990 and an 8 % decline in 1991, GDP registered an increase of 1.5% in 1992 and&#13;
3.8% in 1993, the most recent year for which complete data are available. Among&#13;
the important structural changes which have taken place, the dominance of heavy&#13;
industries has declined and light industries have steadily increased in&#13;
importance. These macroeconomic and structural changes have had a major impact&#13;
on the energy sector.   Industrial energy consumption experienced the largest&#13;
decline (15% in 1990, 12% in 1991 and 8% in 1992), due to the significant&#13;
decrease in industrial output and the closure or downsizing of several major&#13;
energy-intensive enterprises, and a modest 1% growth in 1993. Residential energy&#13;
consumption also declined because of the decrease of real household incomes&#13;
combined with large increases in residential energy prices.   The level of&#13;
residential energy consumption in 1993 was 3% higher than in 1992 but still 11%&#13;
lower than in 1989. Consequently, Poland's total energy consumption decreased&#13;
by almost 20% in 1990 and by about 3% in 1991, and gradually increased by about&#13;
1% per year during 1992-93.&#13;
2.    Declining Production.   Poland produces on average 97% of its total energy&#13;
needs. Hard coal, lignite and natural gas are the main energy sources produced&#13;
in Poland.   Since 1990, their production experienced large declines due to&#13;
Poland's industrial restructuring and decline in industry demand. Hard Coal and&#13;
lignite: Continuing the downward trend started in 1989 when coal mines produced&#13;
a total of 111 million TOE, production decreased by about 17 million TOE (a 15%&#13;
drop) in 1990, by about 4 million TOE in 1991 (a 4% drop), by about 2 million TOE&#13;
in 1992 (a 2% drop), and reached 89 million TOE in 1993. With an annual hard&#13;
coal output of 76 million TOE (134 million tons) Poland is now ranked as the&#13;
world's seventh largest hard coal producer rather than the fourth as it had been&#13;
for many years until 1989.   Natural Gas: Domestic production of natural gas&#13;
varies according to the seasonal variations in gas demand, with contracted gas&#13;
imports (exclusively from the Former Soviet Union (FSU)) providing the base&#13;
supply. In 1990 production declined by about 1 million TOE, a 31% decline from&#13;
the 1989 level of 3.5 million TOE. Though it bounced back by about 12% to reach&#13;
a level of 2.7 million TOE in 1991, production in 1992, at a level of 2.6 million&#13;
TOE, was at only about 75% of the 1989 production level. Because of additional&#13;
gas supply requirements to meet growing demand from residential customers&#13;
combined with a decrease in gas imports, domestic production increased in 1993&#13;
by 28% to a level of 3.3 million TOE, corresponding to 95% of the 1989 production&#13;
level.&#13;
3.    Changes in Energy Trade.  Net imports account on average for 3% of Poland's&#13;
total energy needs. While imports typically provide nearly 100% of oil supplies&#13;
and 60-75% of gas supplies, exports consist mainly of hard coal. Because of&#13;
factor such as export quotas, the abrupt decline in exports to the FSU, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2-1&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
continuous production declines, hard coal exports dropped sharply from the 1989&#13;
level (19.4 million TOE) and were in 1991 about 74% of the 1989 export level.&#13;
Starting in 1992, Poland diversified its export market and gradually increased&#13;
its coal exports again, to reach in 1993 about 85% of the 1989 export level. On&#13;
the import side, Poland imported 14.1 million TOE of crude oil in 1993, 5% less&#13;
than the 1989 level. More than half of the crude oil imports came from the FSU.&#13;
Natural gas imports from the FSU decreased in 1991 by about 1.5 million TOE from&#13;
the 1990 level (a 21% decline). Gas imports in 1992 stayed at the 1991 level and&#13;
decreased by 12% in 1993. Energy trade is now almost exclusively conducted in&#13;
hard currencies. In monetary terms, total energy imports in 1993 were US$2.3&#13;
billion, equal to 12% of total goods imports. Total energy exports were US$1.4&#13;
billion, equal to about 10% of total goods exports.&#13;
4.    Declining Role of Coal and Increasing Role of Gas, Oil and District Heat.&#13;
As the structure of the Polish economy changes and energy prices are being&#13;
adjusted towards economic levels, Poland's energy consumption is moving away from&#13;
coal towards natural gas and oil. Tighter enforcement of environmental standards&#13;
will accelerate this change. Though the share of coal (hard coal and lignite)&#13;
in primary energy supply has been stable at about 93% during 1989-93, the share&#13;
of coal in final energy consumption has declined significantly, from 41% in 1989&#13;
to 36% in 1993. During the same period, the combined share of oil and gas in&#13;
final energy consumption increased from 27% to 29% and the share of district heat&#13;
increased from 21% to 24%.   The drop of coal's share in final consumption&#13;
reflects in part the changes in the structure of industrial production, because&#13;
industrial sectors with high coal consumption experienced the sharpest&#13;
contraction during this period.   Another factor is the increasingly higher&#13;
environmental user charges and penalties, which induce a fuel switching away from&#13;
coal. Even though domestic supplies of both oil and gas will in the short-term&#13;
remain low compared to the potential demand, domestic gas production could supply&#13;
in the medium-term a larger part of demand if Poland's reserves of natural gas&#13;
and coal-bed methane are tapped more efficiently.&#13;

POLAND - POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT&#13;
Power Sector&#13;
A.    General&#13;
1.    Generation.   As of the end of 19931/, the power sector had an installed&#13;
electric  capacity  of 32,750 MW., of which  29,438 MW0 belongs  to the  power&#13;
industry and 3,312 MWe to auto-producers (manufacturing industry).  The power&#13;
industry generates its electricity from 27,431 MWe of thermal power plants&#13;
(system power plants: 23,354 MWe M/, combined heat and power (CHP) plants: 4,077&#13;
MW0) and 2,007 MWe of hydropower plants (run-of-river: 677 MWe., pumped-storage:&#13;
1,330 MW8). About 5.5% of the capacity of system plants can produce electricity&#13;
in cogeneration mode, bringing the available cogeneration capacity to about 5,353&#13;
MWe. In addition to electricity generation, the power industry supplies heat to&#13;
district heating  networks  throughout Poland.   Its  total available  thermal&#13;
capacity is about 26,940 MWt, of which about 11,435 14Wt are in CHP units and&#13;
15,505 MWt in heat only boiler (HOB) units. About 80% of the CHP units and 66%&#13;
of the HOB units are installed at the CHP plants. The remaining HOB capacity is&#13;
at the system plants (6%) and at HOB plants (28%).&#13;
2.    Gross electricity generation was about 134 TWh in 1993, down about 8% from&#13;
its 1989 peak (145 TWh) .  About 97% of the electrical energy is produced in&#13;
thermal plants; autoproducers account for about 6% of this total. The remaining&#13;
3% is hydro electrical energy; the share between run-of-river and pumped storage&#13;
plants is on average in the ratio 42:58.&#13;
3.    Until 1989, the power industry consumed on average about 60 million tons&#13;
(Mt) of low grade hard coal and about 70 million tons of lignite annually.&#13;
Average calorific values were about 4,360 kcal/kg for coal and 2,000 kcal/kg for&#13;
lignite. The coal that is being supplied typically has a high ash content (up&#13;
to 30%), despite the fact that most boilers are designed for an ash content of&#13;
up to 15%. As a result of slugging, plant outages are frequent. Because of the&#13;
sharp decrease in both electricity and heat demand, 1993 consumption of hard coal&#13;
and lignite was down to 41 Mt for hard coal and 66 Mt respectively. However,&#13;
more stringent environmental requirements have recently induced power plants to&#13;
seek better quality coal with at least 5,100 kcal/kg calorific value, 15-20% ash&#13;
content and less  than 0.8%  sulfur content.  Generating  capacity  is fuelled&#13;
primarily by hard coal (66%) and lignite (28%), while the remaining 6% is&#13;
provided by run-of-river hydro plants (2%) and pumped storage hydro plants (4%).&#13;
}V    The most recent year for which consistent sector-wide data are available.&#13;
2/    As used in Poland, the term system power plant means a power generation plant consisting of condensing&#13;
units that produce electricity only and that are connected to the 400 and 220 kV networks. There are 23 such&#13;
system power plants in Poland. Nine of them also have cogeneration units that supply district heat to the&#13;
neighborhoods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2-2&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
The volume of gas used for electricity generation is practically insignificant.&#13;
Small quantities of oil are consumed mostly for start-up and flame stabilization.&#13;
4.    The power industry has 55 thermal power plants, of which 32 are combined&#13;
heat and power plants.  In addition, it has 114 run-of-river hydro plants and 5&#13;
pumped-storage hydro plants.  The largest thermal power plant is the lignite&#13;
fired Belchatow plant with an installed capacity of 4,320 MWe.  The largest&#13;
hydropower plant is the pumped storage plant of Zarnowiec, with a total output&#13;
of 680 MWe. Auto-producers operate about 223 thermal power plants, the largest&#13;
being located at the oil refinery in Plock (275 MWe).&#13;
5.    Transmission Network.    The national electric power transmission grid&#13;
consists primarily of the 400 kV and 220 kV networks, with total lengths of 4,316&#13;
km and 8,294 km respectively, and of one 750 kV line of 114 km. Power is being&#13;
traded between Poland and its neighboring countries (Czech Republic, Germany, and&#13;
FSU) at the 400 and 220 kV voltage levels as well as at 750 kV, the latter mainly&#13;
for electricity import from the FSU. In addition, the Polish transmission grid&#13;
is used for power transit between the FSU and Austria and Switzerland, through&#13;
the Czech and Slovak systems.&#13;
6.    Substations.  The total power rating of the substations in the Polish power&#13;
industry  is  106,835  MVA.    At high voltage  levels,  there  are  159  power&#13;
transformers of total installed capacity of 30,225 MVA, of which: (i) 14 units&#13;
(5,920 MVA) are for power transfer involving 400/220 kV transformation; and (ii)&#13;
145 units (24,305 MVA) are for bulk-power supply involving 20 units (5,000 MVA)&#13;
of 400/110 kV transformation and 125 units (19,305 MVA) of 220/110 kV&#13;
transformation.    In addition,  there  are  two units  (5,000 MVA)  involving&#13;
750/400 kV transformation for power transfer from Ukraine.&#13;
7.    Status of Interconnection with UCPTE network.    Despite the absence of&#13;
synchronism between the UCPTE and the former CMEA system, there is a potential&#13;
transmission capacity of nearly 15,000 MVA in service or under construction&#13;
between the two systems. A large share of this capacity is currently used to&#13;
supply isolated zones. Otherwise, expensive back-to-back direct current links&#13;
allow the coupling of two non-synchronized systems.   The total capacity of&#13;
Poland's international interconnections is 4,500 MVA. The electricity exchanged&#13;
between Poland and its neighboring countries in 1993 was 8.0 TWh for exports and&#13;
5.6 TWh for imports. Energy exchanged with the FSU has been drastically reduced&#13;
to about 1.0 TWh (imports only) from its 1989 level of 7.7 TWh. The 750 kV line&#13;
from Ukraine is now practically unused.&#13;
8.    Several working groups of the UCPTE/UNIPEDE are studying the possibilities&#13;
of eventual connection of the Czech, Slovak, Polish and Hungarian power systems&#13;
to the unified UCPTE system, and the sequencing of such connections. In 1993,&#13;
the Polish Power Grid Company completed a study which evaluates opportunities for&#13;
adapting Poland's generation and transmission facilities to UCPTE requirements,&#13;
both from the technical as well as from the organizational point of view. This&#13;
study was done in collaboration with public utilities from France, Germany and&#13;
Sweden. This study identified the transmission development, rehabilitation and&#13;
modernization investments needed in the immediate future that satisfy both the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2-2&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
operational requirements of the UCPTE system and at the same time meet the long-&#13;
term development needs of the Polish power system.   This is because UCPTE&#13;
operating requirements are typical of requirements that any power system should&#13;
meet to have secure and efficient system operations. In addition to the UCPTE&#13;
study, a long-term transmission development study was performed by Electricite&#13;
de France (EdF) which defined the optimal network configuration up to the year&#13;
2010, and analyzed the economic benefits of the identified network development.&#13;
In October 1993, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary and Poland successfully&#13;
completed a test of the interconnection and synchronous operation of their four&#13;
networks, without ties with the FSU and German networks and in full compliance&#13;
with the UCPTE operation criteria.&#13;
9.    Distribution.   The distribution networks consist of the 110 kV grid, and&#13;
the medium and low voltage levels.  The 110 kV network has a total length of&#13;
31,446 km. The medium voltage network includes rated voltages ranging from 1 kV&#13;
to 60 kV, and has a total length of 267,403 km. The low voltage network consists&#13;
of voltage levels lower than 1 kV, and has total length of 366,200 km.&#13;
B.    Operational Status of the Existing Facilities of the Power Industry&#13;
a.    Generation&#13;
10.   Age of the Units.   The Polish power system suffers from aging units, most&#13;
of which have passed their design life. Out of the 255 turbosets, 89 units with&#13;
a total capacity of 2,831 MWe (or 10% of the installed electric capacity) have&#13;
been in service for over 30 years; 69 units (or 7,349 MW0 or 27% of total&#13;
installed electric capacity) are over 20 years old. By end-1997, corresponding&#13;
to the introduction of new emission standards, the average age for 17% of the&#13;
total capacity will be about 35 years and for 47% it will be about 29 years.&#13;
11.   Most of the thermal power plants built before 1985 were designed based on&#13;
Eastern European standards (Czechoslovak, Polish or Soviet) and the design life&#13;
is 15 years (or 100,000 hours) of operation, whereas the ones built after 1985&#13;
are designed based on Western standards (30 years lifetime or 200,000 hours).&#13;
By 1998, any rehabilitation work done on thermal power plants commissioned before&#13;
1980-85 will extend the lifetime by another 15-20 years at most and will include&#13;
major boiler and turbine overhaul. After that, additional investment for life&#13;
extension would have to be reconsidered. Although age of the plant does not tell&#13;
us much about the technical condition of the plants, it is an important factor&#13;
to consider in deciding whether or not to extend the life of the unit, and to&#13;
install major environmental control equipment such as flue gas desulfurization.&#13;
12.   Unit Availability - Forced Outages.  Poor instrumentation and automation&#13;
control, use of low quality coal and poor combustion techniques, and unit age are&#13;
some of the factors contributing to the low average plant availability in Poland&#13;
(75-85%), compared to an average for Western Europe of 85-90%.&#13;
13.   Efficiency.  Plant efficiency is defined as the utilization of the energy&#13;
content of the fuel consumed. At full production, the efficiency of Poland's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2-2&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
coal-fired plants ranges from 25% to 36% for condensing units and from 60% to 84%&#13;
for cogenerating units. Lignite-fired units have an average efficiency of 34%.&#13;
Typical average efficiencies for coal-fired thermal plants and cogeneration units&#13;
in Western Europe are 34% and 85%, respectively.&#13;
14.   System Flexibility.  96% of Poland's power generating capacity is baseload&#13;
capacity, not adapted for load following.   Although the peaking function is&#13;
ensured by the pumped storage hydro plants (4% of power generating capacity), the&#13;
Polish power system is in need for further peaking capacity, mainly from gas&#13;
turbines.&#13;
15.   Environmental Performance.  Until 1989, the power industry generated about&#13;
2.0 Million tons (Mt) of SO2 and 0.8 Mt of dust annually. It contributed 50% of&#13;
the SO2 and 31% of the dust emitted nationwide.  In 1993, the power industry&#13;
generated about 1.3 Mt of S02 (35% reduction) and 0.3 Mt of dust (63% reduction),&#13;
contributing to 47% of the SO2 and 17%% of the dust emitted nationwide.  The&#13;
following factors contributed together to these reductions: (i) the sharp&#13;
decrease in both electricity and heat demand; (ii) more stringent environmental&#13;
requirements; (iii) the use of better quality coal in electricity and heat&#13;
production; and (iv) environmental protection investments within the power&#13;
industry focusing initially almost exclusively on improving the efficiency of the&#13;
electrostatic precipitators  to reduce particulate emissions.   The average&#13;
efficiency of these precipitators is currently 97%. NOx emissions from the power&#13;
industry were stable at about 0.4 Mt annually (a third of NOx emitted&#13;
nationwide).  The introduction of new environmental standards (para. 16) will&#13;
cause a shift in investments towards equipment for limiting sulfur dioxide and&#13;
nitrogen oxides, as well as for further improvements in electrostatic&#13;
precipitator performance to reach an efficiency level of above 99%.&#13;
16.   The Government of Poland introduced new environmental standards for the&#13;
period after December 31, 1997. The standards are for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen&#13;
oxide and particulate emissions and distinguish three categories: A (old plants);&#13;
B (rehabilitated plants); and C (new plants). About 2,900 MW. (or 11%) of the&#13;
total installed capacity of thermal power plants does not meet the SO2 emission&#13;
level for Category A. About 12,300 MWe (or 45%) marginally meet the Category A&#13;
emission levels for particulates. Because of recent improvements in fuel quality&#13;
about 60% of the capacity of existing thermal power plants now meets the Category&#13;
B level for SO2.  Only 10% and 25% of the capacity of existing thermal power&#13;
plants meet Category B emission level for particulates and NOx, respectively.&#13;
However, because of ongoing investments in efficiency improvement of&#13;
electrostatic precipitators compliance with Category B emission levels for&#13;
particulates will be achieved for about 50% of the thermal power plants by 1995&#13;
and up to 90% by 1997. Similarly, ongoing investments in primary NOx reduction&#13;
methods (combustion modifications and installation of low-NOx-burners) will&#13;
permit to achieve compliance for about 40% of thermal power plants by 1997. Flue&#13;
gas desulfurization installations were completed by the end of 1994 for thermal&#13;
power units with a 2,240 MW0 total capacity. None of the thermal power plants&#13;
comply with Category C emission limits for SO2 at this stage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2-2&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
17.   Cogeneration of Heat and Power.   Over the period 1990-92, CHP plants&#13;
account for 66% of the power industry's total heat production but only for 10%&#13;
of total electricity generation. A number of large HOBs were originally planned&#13;
to be CHP units, but because of a shortage of funds they were kept as heating&#13;
plants without electricity cogeneration capability. These HOBs are inefficient.&#13;
Investment in CHP is crucial to heat supply but is a relatively smaller concern&#13;
in overall electric power investment.   The total contribution of CHP plants&#13;
belonging to power industry and autoproducers to public district heat sales is&#13;
estimated to be in the range of 20-30% (50-60% of the heat sold by the power&#13;
industry and autoproducers to district heating enterprises is cogenerated),&#13;
depending on the load factor.   This proportion is below the 70-80% range&#13;
generally considered as optimal. By introducing proper pricing for bulk heat&#13;
between the power utility and the DHEs and enforcing environmental regulations&#13;
for heavily polluting local HOBs, CHP's contribution in both power and heat&#13;
production should be increased.   In addition, a strategy towards converting&#13;
either existing condensing plants and/or coal burning HOBs to a CHP mode of&#13;
operation should be developed, wherever natural gas fired CHPs/HOBs are not a&#13;
viable option.   Both strategies would provide a higher efficiency of coal&#13;
utilization and environmental improvement.&#13;
18.   Staffing.  The power industry employed about 57,545 people in 1993, of&#13;
which more than half of the employees are in generation. For the power industry,&#13;
operating personnel is on average high at 575 employees per TWh of sales compared&#13;
to a West European average of 355 employees/TWh. However, for Western European&#13;
utilities with similar overall sales, this indicator is in the range 130-200&#13;
employees per TWh.&#13;
b.    Transmission and Distribution&#13;
19.   The 400 kV transmission grid was build during the 1970s and '80s. Although&#13;
quite modern in concept, it is still not a fully integrated system.   Hence,&#13;
reliability of electricity supply in case of plant failure is low. The 220 kV&#13;
grid was built in the 1950s and '60s, and is fully utilized.  Some areas in the&#13;
Upper Silesia are overloaded, thus increasing energy losses.  Networks at 110 kV&#13;
voltage and lower are of poor design and obsolete technologies, lack connecting&#13;
and safety devices, and are in need of major rehabilitation. Transmission and&#13;
distribution losses in Poland average about 14%, and are the highest in Europe&#13;
(average 7-8% for similar systems); about 85% of these losses are in the&#13;
distribution networks. A detailed assessment of the high voltage transmission&#13;
networks is presented in Annex 2-4.&#13;
C.    Power Demand&#13;
20.   Present Power Demand.  1993 peak demand was at 22,749 MW., up by about 6%&#13;
over the 1992 peak but still about 6% lower than the 1989 peak and 3% over the&#13;
1990 peak. During 1990-93, system gross reserve margin varied within the 25-33%&#13;
range,  typical for a thermal system.   However,  since the winter peaks are&#13;
pronounced in Poland, this means that during the remainder of the year the&#13;
margins may go up to 40-50%.  Over the period 1990-93, the share of households&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2-2&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
has remained at about 22% of final electricity consumption, the share of the&#13;
commercial sector has increased from 8% to 11%, and the share of the industry has&#13;
decreased from 61% to 58%. The balance is for agriculture and street lighting,&#13;
which has remained stable at about 9% of total consumption.&#13;
21.   System Load Factor.   Until 1989, the system load factor was on average&#13;
about 69%. This is typical for a system with a flat load curve and confirms that&#13;
the Polish system is energy intensive. The load factor decreased to about 66%&#13;
during 1990-91, increased to about 70% in 1992 and decreased again to 66% in&#13;
1993. The decrease in 1990-91 and in 1993 can be explained partially by the&#13;
energy restructuring program and consumer awareness due to increases in energy&#13;
prices. The 1992 increase in the load factor can probably be explained by the&#13;
fact that consumers have become accustomed to the new electricity price levels.&#13;
The load factor is an important factor to consider in planning energy strategy&#13;
for the future.   A high load factor is significant in several respects:  (i)&#13;
efficiency measures must be effective over a period of many hours in order to&#13;
have a significant impact; (ii) it makes it more difficult to schedule planned&#13;
maintenance, especially when long lasting reliability problems appear; and (iii)&#13;
it makes pollution problems more severe and increases the need for pollution&#13;
controls.&#13;
22.   This period of relatively low electricity demand combined with the current&#13;
excess capacity provides an ideal opportunity for: (a) implementing a more&#13;
aggressive plant retirement, rehabilitation and modernization program; (b) making&#13;
provision for installing additional peaking plants (e.g., relatively cheap and&#13;
quick to install gas turbines), if demand growth should materialize, thus&#13;
deferring any major capital intensive baseload plants beyond 2000; (c) defining&#13;
an implementation strategy for improving the environmental performance of thermal&#13;
power plants to the extent possible to meet new emission standards on a least-&#13;
cost basis; (d) strengthening the transmission grid, and increasing its transfer&#13;
capacity and reliability through automation and loop closing; and (e) reducing&#13;
transmission and distribution energy losses through flow switching from the&#13;
presently overloaded 110 kV grid to higher voltage carriers.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 2-3&#13;
Page 1 of 3&#13;
POLAND - POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT&#13;
Current Network Condition&#13;
General Assessment&#13;
1.    The 400 kV transmission system was designed originally to permit wheeling&#13;
of power through Poland, particularly from the Ukraine to the Czech Republic, and&#13;
exchange of power with the former East Germany. However, during recent years,&#13;
the 400 kV system was further developed to function as an overlay of the lower&#13;
voltage systems to permit bulk power transfer within the country and thereby&#13;
offload these systems.  System reliability under (n-l) criterionl, is not always&#13;
met and will be further negatively affected once Poland loses its interconnection&#13;
with the former East German system (possibly by end of 1994). Equipment at the&#13;
400 kV level is generally less than 20 years old and in better condition than the&#13;
220 and 110 kV equipment.  However, modernization of the 400 kV equipment is&#13;
needed  to  provide  more  reliable  equipment performance.   Under light load&#13;
conditions, the system voltage control is presently inadequate and is in need of&#13;
reactive power compensation. This would avoid having to switch off 400 kV lines&#13;
as a means to control system voltage.&#13;
2.    At the 220 and 110 kV levels the situation is worse, especially at the 110&#13;
kV level. Because of obsolete design, equipment at these voltage 'Levels is no&#13;
longer capable of meeting the original functional specifications in a&#13;
satisfactory way.   Current system protection under fault conditions  is not&#13;
secure.    Equipment  failure  is  therefore  high  and  system  reliability  is&#13;
significantly reduced. In addition, equipment can explode and is thus unsafe.&#13;
Current equipment technology is also obsolete and 220 kV and 110 kV equipment is&#13;
more than 20 and 40 years old, respectively. This poses severe problems with&#13;
respect to availability of spare parts, network operation, operators and workers&#13;
training, and of compatibility with more modern equipment. Protection, control&#13;
and telecommunications systems, at both the 220 kV and 110 kV substations,&#13;
provide inadequate performance from the point of view of both security and&#13;
dependability. Energy management and network dispatching cannot be carried out&#13;
on real-time basis. Finally, transmission losses are high, especially at the 110&#13;
kV level.   This is due to the fact that the 110 kV system is overloaded in&#13;
certain areas and is used as a sub-transmission system rather than as a regional&#13;
distribution network. Modernization of the 400 and 220 kV levels will permit to&#13;
off-load the 110 kV network and thus reduce transmission losses.&#13;
Current Condition of the Network's Primary Apparatus&#13;
3.    At the 400 kV Level.  The equipment at this level is relatively recent (on&#13;
average less than 20 years old) and its performance is relatively better than&#13;
that of the other voltage levels. Some of the 400 kV primary equipment will need&#13;
The (n-1) criterion is that a power system must be able to maintain its supply and demand balance even in&#13;
case of an outage of one major network operating element (the largest generation plant, or one transmission&#13;
line, or one transformer, or in certain instances one busbar).&#13;

to be replaced in order to shorten fault clearance times and provide more&#13;
reliable equipment performance.&#13;
4.    At the 220 kV Level.  A large proportion of the 220 kV equipment is at&#13;
least 20 years old.   Service experience has illustrated that most problems&#13;
encountered are mechanical in nature, especially with equipment of the air blast&#13;
design, which could explode. Operational performance has been quite unreliable.&#13;
For 220 kV primary apparatus, spare parts are no longer available, as the design&#13;
is no longer being manufactured.  At the 220 and 110 kV levels, a mixture of&#13;
modernization of substations and direct replacement is required.&#13;
5.    At the 110 kV Level.  The worst situation is at the 110 kV level, where&#13;
much of the primary equipment is totally obsolete, at least 40 years old in&#13;
design and service life, and requires frequent attention to maintain a barely&#13;
acceptable level of mechanical performance. There is a mixture of airblast and&#13;
minimum oil circuit breaker types, none of which are likely to be capable of&#13;
performing their assigned rating and cannot be assigned any useful fault current&#13;
interruption rating. Spare parts are virtually unavailable, which represents a&#13;
major problem.&#13;
Current Condition of the Network's Secondary Apparatus&#13;
6.    The secondary equipment utilized in both the 220 and 110 kV substations,&#13;
comprising the protection, control and telecommunications systems, provides an&#13;
inadequate performance from the point of view of both security and dependability.&#13;
Transmission lines require duplicate main protection, but the existing scheme&#13;
comprises only a single main protection with supplementary ground relaying. In&#13;
many instances fault clearing times are quite long, resulting in poor network&#13;
performance. In a number of instances busbar zone protection is not provided,&#13;
which may cause widespread shutdown of the 220 kV network in case of a busbar&#13;
fault.   The secondary equipment needs to be upgraded to achieve more secure&#13;
protection clearing times in order to meet the performance criteria of the Polish&#13;
power grid, whether interconnected with UCPTE or operating in isolation.&#13;
Redundancy of protective relaying, together with design diversity is necessary&#13;
to achieve these objectives, particularly in the case of transmission line&#13;
protection. The same level of redundancy and security will need to be applied&#13;
to the auxiliary power systems supplying the relaying schemes to achieve the&#13;
necessary duplication of the AC and DC auxiliary power systems.   At large&#13;
substations at key points within the transmission system, emergency diesel&#13;
generators will be needed to permit the restoration of power supply to the&#13;
substation in the event of a total power system blackout.&#13;
Factors Influencing Future Network Development&#13;
7.    Future development plans need to recognize the following factors:  (a)&#13;
short-term loss of synchronous ties with VEAG (the power system covering the&#13;
former East Germany); (b) reinforcement of ties to the Czech Republic and&#13;
Slovakia to permit North-South power flow; (c) loss of synchronous ties to the&#13;
FSU; (d) need to reinforce power supply to the Southwestern load area of Poland,&#13;
particularly in view of the loss of ties to VEAG; (e) power system upgrade to&#13;
meet UCPTE performance levels that would permit restoration of synchronous ties&#13;
to VEAG and thus to UCPTE; (f) need for shutting down generating units at major&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2-3&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
plants for refurbishment and environmental upgrading, together with the upgrading&#13;
and modernization of the major Mikulowa 400/220/110 kV substation; and (g) need&#13;
for reactive power control to avoid switching off 400 kV lines for system voltage&#13;
control. These factors are significant in determining the short and medium term&#13;
system reinforcement requirements.&#13;
System Planning Criteria&#13;
8.    Current system planning utilizes the (n-i) criterion. Modernization of the&#13;
400 and 220 kV facilities will be required to provide more rapid and secure&#13;
tripping under system fault conditions, e.g. duplicate main protection on&#13;
transmission lines, installation of bus zone protections, etc. The 220 kV system&#13;
will not be significantly expanded but relatively small incremental investments&#13;
will be needed. The principal investments will comprise reinforcement of the&#13;
110 kV system, via 400/110 kV transformation, in order to relegate it to its&#13;
proper function of power distribution on a regional basis and interconnection of&#13;
CHP plants.&#13;
Work Required at 400/220/110 kV Levels&#13;
9.    The work required across the 400/220/110 kV interconnected system may be&#13;
classified as follows: (a) modernization in accordance with UCPTE criteria, e.g.&#13;
decrease of fault clearing time, faster circuit breakers and protection relays,&#13;
and higher security relaying systems  to ensure fault detection.   This is&#13;
typically required for 400 kV equipment in substations that are essential to the&#13;
UCPTE interconnection; (b) refurbishment as required by increase in network load,&#13;
e.g.  fault levels and changes of the circuit breakers.   This is typically&#13;
required for the 220 kV equipment in substations that are essential to both the&#13;
Polish power network and the UCPTE interconnection; (c) replacement of inadequate&#13;
equipment as indicated by poor performance, high failure rate, lack of spare&#13;
parts, high maintenance costs, obsolete equipment and design limitations. This&#13;
is typically required for 220 and 110 kV substations using the old Russian type&#13;
of equipment; and (d) replacement of equipment likely to fail (explode) and that&#13;
could endanger the safety of operating staff and of the public where stations are&#13;
close to public areas.   This is typically required for the 110 kV equipment&#13;
substations.&#13;
10.   A comprehensive survey has been completed by PPGC that identifies all 400&#13;
and 220 kV primary equipment in need of replacement. A priority schedule was&#13;
established for replacement of 400 and 220 kV equipment in substations located&#13;
in the western part of Poland (adjacent to the borders). These substations are&#13;
critical both to the Polish power network and the UCPTE interconnection.   A&#13;
program for rehabilitating the other 400 and 220 kV substation equipment will be&#13;
implemented after completion of this project. While this schedule also includes&#13;
replacement of 110 kV substation equipment in conjunction with 400 and 220 kV&#13;
equipment, a major separate replacement program will also be required for all&#13;
other 110 kV equipment, which is the responsibility of the distribution&#13;
companies. This should be developed in conjunction with the relegation of this&#13;
network to a normal power distribution function (as opposed to a subtransmission&#13;
function). In other words, the 110 kV equipment substations should be replaced&#13;
only if they are an integral part of a long-term distribution system development&#13;
plan.&#13;

Annex 3-2&#13;
POLAND - POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT&#13;
Transmission Assets Transfer&#13;
1.    Following  creation  of  PPGC  as  a joint  stock  company  in  1990,  an&#13;
unanticipated legal issue arose.   The high voltage transmission and pumped&#13;
storage assets could not be simply transferred from the (state-owned)&#13;
distribution companies to a joint stock company, except as a sales transaction&#13;
at a prohibitive cost.  However, the Law on Ownership Transformation of Certain&#13;
State-Owned Enterprises of Fundamental Importance for the State Economy of&#13;
February 5, 1993 enabled the Minister of Industry, inter alia, to transfer assets&#13;
between commercialized entities by decree.   Such transfers are subject to&#13;
approval from the Anti-Monopoly Office and the Council of Ministers, the latter&#13;
in order to avoid payment of a 40% transfer tax.&#13;
2.    Under the above mentioned law,  the power distribution companies were&#13;
commercialized in July 1993. An August 31, 1993 decree on the transfer of assets&#13;
to PPGC stipulated transfer of all lines and substation equipment at the 750,400&#13;
and 220 kV levels, selected pumped storage plants, and some equipment at the 110&#13;
kV level to PPGC. Since certain investments will be needed at the 110 kV level&#13;
to protect investments proposed to be made at higher voltage levels, ownership&#13;
of interface assets at the 110 kV level was important.&#13;
3.    Asset Valuation.  As for the rest of the energy sector, fixed assets in the&#13;
power sector are significantly undervalued. Studies performed by consultants for&#13;
the Grid indicate that, based on replacement value methodology, the high voltage&#13;
and pumped storage assets should be revalued by a factor of about 6.0 times. The&#13;
gross book value of the assets transferred to PPGC was about US$ 415 million,&#13;
while the gross replacement value would be US$ 2.4 billion. The net values are&#13;
about 50% of the corresponding gross values.&#13;
4.    Pumped Storage Plants.  Pumped storage plants are primarily used to cope&#13;
with peak demand. Their effective operation requires a detailed knowledge of&#13;
marginal costs at different times of the day, as well as exact information of all&#13;
circumstances concerning the ability to generate electricity elsewhere in the&#13;
network. These factors favored transfer of these assets to PPGC. Four pumped&#13;
storage plants (Zarnowiec (680 MW), Porabka-Zar (500 MW), Zydowo (150 MW), Dychow&#13;
(48 MW)) were transferred to the Grid and merged into one large joint stock&#13;
company. Prior to August 31, 1993, these plants were independent companies, not&#13;
associated with a distribution company.   The Grid has taken a 75% equity share&#13;
in these companies, and the plants themselves took most of the remaining share&#13;
capital. The plants are being operated and maintained by four separate joint&#13;
stock companies, owned by the employees who got a part of the share capital of&#13;
the pumped storage power plants themselves. One pumped storage plant (Solina;&#13;
136 MW) remained with its local distribution company. This will enable it to&#13;
meet its local peak demand and thus reduce its take-off from the national grid.&#13;
As a result, its bulk supply price could be lower.&#13;

Electricity Tariff Structure&#13;
A.    Retail Tariff Structure&#13;
1.    A new structure for power retail tariffs was introduced on January 1, 1993.&#13;
The new structure intends to establish retail tariffs for different consumption&#13;
categories on the basis of costs of delivering a unit of electric energy, so it&#13;
represents a significant step towards price rationalization in the power sector.&#13;
Table 1 shows the retail tariff structure as of January 1, 1995.&#13;
2.    The new structure is mainly composed of the following classes of tariffs&#13;
on the basis of voltage levels:&#13;
Class A - high voltage tariff for voltage levels equal to or above 100 kV&#13;
(mainly large industrial enterprises);&#13;
Class B - medium voltage tariff for voltage levels between 1 kV and 60 kV&#13;
(medium industrial and commercial enterprises, railroad); and&#13;
Class C - low voltage tariff for voltage levels below 1 kV (small&#13;
industrial, commercial, large rural, and residential customers with demand&#13;
of more than 40 kW on capacity or of 80 MWh on energy per year);&#13;
Class G - low voltage tariff for residential customers with demand of less&#13;
than 40 kW and 80 MWh, respectively, per year.&#13;
Class R - medium or low voltage level tariff for customers not connected&#13;
to meters and whose usage lasts a short period of time, such as lighting&#13;
for outdoor concerts, shooting films).&#13;
3.    Each class is further subdivided into several categories according to&#13;
whether: (a) capacity and energy are charged separately, and (b) charges are&#13;
differentiated by time of a day. A system of symbols is developed to represent&#13;
each tariff category in each class. A typical tariff category can be represented&#13;
as (Xyz), where X represents the class of the tariff (A, B, C, G, or R); Y&#13;
indicates whether the tariff is two-part (capacity and energy) or one-part (2 for&#13;
two-part and 1 for one-part); and Z indicates whether the tariff is time-related&#13;
(1 for one rate over 24 hours, 2 for peak and off-peak rate, and 3 for peak, off-&#13;
peak and night rate).  For example, C22 represents a low voltage level tariff&#13;
with a two-part charge (capacity and energy) and two rates (peak and off-peak).&#13;
4.    Most customers with capacity demand higher than 40 kW or annual energy&#13;
demand of more than 80 MWh are charged according to a two-part tariff. Customers&#13;
whose capacity demand is lower than 40 kW and annual energy demand is less than&#13;
80 MWh are charged a one-part tariff and can choose either uniform or time-&#13;
related rates.&#13;

5.    The demand charge in a two-part tariff is determined as follows:&#13;
i)    Before December of each year,  the customer submits an order of&#13;
demanded capacity (measured as the maximum 15-minutes active load&#13;
for each service line) in every month for the following year. If&#13;
the ordered capacity does not vary by month, there is a 10% discount&#13;
on the charge. The capacity demand can also be ordered during the&#13;
year with a monthly advance notice, but the charge will be 30%&#13;
higher. The customer can also make adjustment on already ordered&#13;
capacity with one month advance notice, in which case the charge&#13;
will be 20% higher for the month in which the adjustment is made.&#13;
ii)   If the actual used capacity is more than ordered,  a penalty is&#13;
applied: the excessive capacity load will be 500% higher than the&#13;
ordered capacity charge.&#13;

B.    Transfer Pricing Structure&#13;
a.    Between Generation and Transmission&#13;
9.    The transfer price between generation and transmission is composed of a&#13;
fixed charge, representing the capacity payment, and a variable charge,&#13;
representing fuel and other variable expenses.&#13;
10.   Fixed Payment Calculation.   Capacity for any generating plant, can be&#13;
specified in 5 different ways:&#13;
i)    Standard Capacity (SC): the average annual achieved capacity of the&#13;
generating plant during the last 3 years;&#13;
ii)   Declared Capacity (DC): the capacity the generating plant desires to&#13;
sell, calculated by subtracting the planned and expected forced&#13;
outages from the standard capacity;&#13;
iii)  Ordered Capacity (OC): the capacity PPGC plans to buy;&#13;
iv)   Non-Ordered Capacity (NC): the capacity declared but not bought; and&#13;
v)    Realized Capacity (RC): the capacity actually sold to PPGC.&#13;
The following always holds:&#13;
SC =&gt; DC =&gt; OC =&gt; RC, and SC -&gt; OC + NC.&#13;
11.   Each year, on the basis of projected demand and a reserve margin, the&#13;
Ministry of Industry and Trade prepares an annual capacity balance. The capacity&#13;
is then allocated to generators, according to the average cost of production in&#13;
generating plants, starting with the least cost producer such as the base load&#13;
plants.   For these low cost producers,  DC is equal  to OC;  for high cost&#13;
producers, OC is less than DC, or OC is equal to zero. The fixed payment for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3-3&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
each generating plant is determined based on the standard capacity, but with&#13;
higher payment to ordered capacity and lower payment to non-ordered capacity.&#13;
12.   Realized capacity may be less than ordered capacity due to a variety of&#13;
reasons. If it is due to lack of demand, the total ordered capacity is paid.&#13;
If it is due to plant failure, the plant has to compensate PPGC for the&#13;
undelivered capacity.&#13;
13.   The payment to each unit of capacity is composed of: depreciation, debt&#13;
service, repair and maintenance cost (overhead) and the allowed return to fixed&#13;
assets in generating plants. The levels of depreciation and debt service vary&#13;
among generating plants, so they are determined on the basis of each individual&#13;
plant. However, the repair and maintenance cost is determined by the averages&#13;
for different types of generators of all generating plants. Altogether there are&#13;
8 types of different generators grouped according to capacity, fuel requirements,&#13;
and mode of generation (power only or CHP), and each of them has a different cost&#13;
structure. The allowed return on fixed assets, which may vary from time to time&#13;
and is defined as the rate of return on the book value of the fixed assets, is&#13;
uniform across generation, transmission and distribution subsectors. However,&#13;
only a portion (65% in 1994) of this allowed return on the fixed assets is&#13;
included in the fixed payment; the remaining 35% is part of the variable payment.&#13;
By transferring a portion of the return on assets to the variable payment, those&#13;
generators which sell more electricity to PPGC receive higher payment for their&#13;
fixed assets.&#13;
14.   Variable Payment Calculation. The variable payment to each unit of energy&#13;
delivered is the sum of the following cost items: fuel, transportation,&#13;
environment fee and a portion of the return on fixed assets. The cost of fuel&#13;
is calculated on the basis of the calorific value of the standard fuel (hard&#13;
coal) for all plants; the transportation cost is calculated on a standard rate&#13;
per unit of standard fuel for all plants; and the environment user charges are&#13;
calculated based on the emission levels of standard fuel and the actual&#13;
environmental fee. For CHP plants of capacity less than 100 MWe, the payment is&#13;
an aggregate unit kWh charge, comprising fixed and variable costs, calculated on&#13;
the basis of prices set for collector power plants.&#13;
b.    Between Transmission and Distribution&#13;
15.   The  transfer  price  between  PPGC  and  the  distribution  companies  is&#13;
determined individually, taking into account the following cost items of the&#13;
distribution company: depreciation, debt service, repair and maintenance costs,&#13;
the rate of return on fixed assets and distribution losses.   The repair and&#13;
maintenance cost is an average for all distribution companies. Other costs are&#13;
also individually dependent on each distribution company.&#13;

Least-Cost Power Generation Program&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The least-cost investment program (LCIP) for power generation is a part of&#13;
PPGC's integrated resources planning (IRP) activities. At the request of PPGC,&#13;
the Bank arranged grant-financed assistance for the LCIP study for power&#13;
generation. The firm Verbund-Plan GmbH of Austria was selected for this task.&#13;
Several Polish institutes and foreign firms participated in this study. Because&#13;
of the necessity to collect and establish consistent sector-wide data, the study&#13;
took about two years and was completed on December 1994.&#13;
2.    The study covers the planning period 1992-2020 with 1992 as the base year.&#13;
Its major focus includes identifying units that are candidates for retirement,&#13;
those that are suitable for rehabilitation and environmental improvement, an&#13;
analysis of economic dispatching strategy under environmental constraints, the&#13;
needs for new generating capacity, and a future capacity structure given the fuel&#13;
supply mix.   The results of the study and the recommendations for the next&#13;
iteration are summarized below.&#13;
Rehabilitation of System Power Plants&#13;
3.    Methodology.  System power plantsl/ were first analyzed on a unit-by-unit&#13;
basis and units with operating time above 120,000 hours were considered as&#13;
candidates for rehabilitation. Because of the large number of units and possible&#13;
rehabilitation combinations thereof, which exceed the optimization capabilities&#13;
of available computerized tools for system analysis, the system power units were&#13;
grouped into in 14 aggregate plants, each aggregate comprising a number of units&#13;
of  similar  size  and  design.    For  each  aggregate,  the  following  four&#13;
rehabilitation options were analyzed: (i) doing nothing, i.e. keeping the unit&#13;
running without any investment until retirement (option 1); (ii) life extension&#13;
to 240,000 hours total and modernization to reach design performance level&#13;
(option 2); (iii) same as (ii), with additional improvement in operational&#13;
efficiency and flexibility (option 3); and (iv) same as (iii), with additional&#13;
life extension to 270,000 hours total (option 4).&#13;
4.    Results.  A system optimization was carried out, resulting in the following&#13;
rehabilitation strategy for the aggregate plants. In most cases, rehabilitation&#13;
turned out to be more economic than new capacity investments.   For most hard&#13;
As used in Poland, the term system power plant means a power generation plant consisting of condensing&#13;
units that produce electricity only and that are connected to the 400 and 220 kV networks. There are 23 such&#13;
system power plants in Poland. Nine of them also have cogeneration units that supply district heat to the&#13;
neighborhoods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3-4&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
coal-fired 200 MWe units, advanced rehabilitation (options 3 and 4) is&#13;
recommended. This would apply to about 1,600 MW. for option 3 and 5,200 MW. for&#13;
option 4.   For the remaining hard coal-fired units (5,200 MW,) option 2 is&#13;
preferable. Advanced rehabilitation (option 3) is also recommended for 6,120 MW.&#13;
of lignite-fired units. Rehabilitation of existing oil-fired units (400 MW.)&#13;
using the same oil-firing technology is not economic.   For plants with unit&#13;
capacity less than 100 MW0, rehabilitation is not economic and repowering or&#13;
conversion to cogeneration should be considered. Rehabilitation of system power&#13;
plants would result in an increase in available capacity of 1,530 MW. during&#13;
1994-2010, of which 860 MWe would be achieved during 1994-2000. About 67% of the&#13;
capacity increase would be achieved in the hard-coal fired plants and the&#13;
remaining 33% in the lignite-fired plants.&#13;
5.    Costs and Schedule.  Assuming a rehabilitation implementation capacity of&#13;
2,000 MW0 per year and a site constraint of no more than two rehabilitation units&#13;
in one site during the same year, the above can be implemented during 1994-2005.&#13;
Investment for rehabilitation of system power plants would amount to US$3.2&#13;
billion, with an annual average of about US$345 million during 1994-2000 and&#13;
about US$225 million during 2001-2005.&#13;
Environmental Upgrade of System Power Plants&#13;
6.    The 1998 Polish emission standards are for sulfur dioxide (S02), nitrogen&#13;
oxide (NOx) and particulate emissions and distinguish three categories: A (old&#13;
plants); B (rehabilitated plants); and C (new plants). Compliance of the system&#13;
power plants with the 1998 Polish emission standards, applied on a unit-by-unit&#13;
basis, would require: (i) a reduction of NOx and particulates emissions for both&#13;
Category B and C by about 56% and 34%, respectively; and (ii) a reduction of SO2&#13;
emissions by about 30% for Category B and 80% for Category C. Using commercially&#13;
available technologies for the environmental retrofit of the system power plants,&#13;
compliance with Polish emission standards would require investments in&#13;
environmental  installations  amounting  to:  (i)  about  US$1.14  billion  (or&#13;
UScent 0.35/kWh) for Category B standard, of which US$660 million (or 58%) for&#13;
S02 compliance, US$260 million (or 23%) for NOx compliance and US$220 million (or&#13;
19%)  for  particulates  compliance;  and  (ii)  about  US$3.7  billion  (or&#13;
UScent 0.9/kWh) for Category C standard, of which US$3.2 billion (or 86%) for S02&#13;
compliance. However, a reduction of about 12% (US$80 million) in investment&#13;
costs for desulfurization equipment could be achieved by applying the bubble&#13;
concept over each system power plant.&#13;
7.    Compliance of the system power plants with the S02 ambient air standards&#13;
would require an additional US$900 million investment in desulfurization&#13;
installations over the requirements for Category B compliance, bringing the total&#13;
investment cost for environmental compliance to about US$2.0 billion.&#13;
Development of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Plants&#13;
8.    CHP development remains a priority strategy for the Polish energy sector,&#13;
as it improves the efficiency of heat production and reduces environmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3-4&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
pollution, compared with a situation where heat and power are produced&#13;
separately. Because CHP development involves local optimization, there is no&#13;
satisfactory methodology for carrying out dual optimization to find a national&#13;
LCIP for the rehabilitation, environmental upgrade and expansion of a system&#13;
containing many plants that produce both heat and power. It is also expected&#13;
that most CHP units that are candidates for retirement would be replaced by the&#13;
cogeneration alternatives resulting from the local optimization. The problem is&#13;
further complicated by the large number of CHP rehabilitation candidates and&#13;
potential for CHP development in Poland. In addition, the economic justification&#13;
for the rehabilitation and environmental upgrade of existing CHP plants should&#13;
be evaluated in conjunction with an assessment of the associated district heating&#13;
systems and of the local environmental requirements and site specifics. Such an&#13;
assessment in turn would provide the optimum heat cogeneration requirement within&#13;
the  region.    However,  development  of new CHP plants  and  any additional&#13;
cogenerated electricity should also be evaluated from the power system point of&#13;
view and on a case-by-case basis.  For all these reasons, a ranking list and&#13;
priority schedule of CHP candidates was not established within the framework of&#13;
this study. Only a general assessment of CHP development potential in Poland was&#13;
made instead.&#13;
9.    Potential CHP development over the period 1995-2010 would cost about US$6.6&#13;
billion (US$220-500 million per year) and would include: (i) rehabilitation of&#13;
existing CHP sources and Category B environmental upgrade (US$1.84 billion, of&#13;
which US$1.15 is for the period 1995-2000); (ii) adaptation of some system power&#13;
plants to produce heat in cogeneration mode (US$275 million, of which US$220&#13;
million is for the period 1995-2000); and (iii) development of new CHP sources&#13;
(US$4.5 billion, of which US$1.8 is for the period 1995-2000). The retirement&#13;
and the rehabilitation of CHP plants would result in a net increase in available&#13;
capacity of 322 MW0 during 1994-2010, of which about 90% would be achieved before&#13;
2000.&#13;
10.   For existing CHP plants, compliance with Polish emission standards would&#13;
require investments in environmental installations amounting to: (i) about US$500&#13;
billion for Category B standard, of which US$180 million (or 36%) for S02&#13;
compliance, US$150 million (or 30%) for NOx compliance and US$170 million (or&#13;
34%) for particulates compliance; and (ii) about US$1.7 billion for Category C&#13;
standard, of which US$1.4 billion (or 82%) for SO2 compliance. Compliance with&#13;
the SO2 ambient air standards would require an additional US$180 million&#13;
investment over the requirements for Category B compliance, bringing the total&#13;
investment cost for environmental compliance to about US$680 million.&#13;
Second Sulfur Protocol&#13;
11.   The recently signed Second Sulfur Protocol introduces both annual quotas&#13;
of SO2 emission quantities for the country and SO2 emission limits for existing&#13;
and new power plants. Under this protocol Poland should reduce its SO2 emission&#13;
level by 37% in 2000, 47% in 2005 and 66% in 2010 compared to 1990 level.&#13;
Compliance with the protocol would cost about US$4.5 billion in desulfurization&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

installations, of which US$3.5 billion is for the system power plants and US$1.0&#13;
billion is for the CHP plants.&#13;
Retirement Program of Power Plants&#13;
12.   By the beginning of 1998, when the new emission standards will become&#13;
effective, the average age of 17% of the total installed generating capacity in&#13;
the power industry will be 35 years; about 47% will have an average age of 29&#13;
years. The study's recommendations include the retirement of about 7,852 MW, of&#13;
power generating capacity during 1994-2010, consisting of 4,710 MW. (60%) of&#13;
lignite-fired system units, 1,605 MW8 (21%) of coal-fired system units and 1,537&#13;
MW8 (19%) of CHP units. About 3,046 MW0 of the total capacity is recommended for&#13;
retirement before 2000 and would consist of: (i) 1,840 MW. (60%) of lignite-fired&#13;
system units including, inter alia, 6 units (1,200 MW0 total) at the Turow Power&#13;
Plant that will be completly rebuilt; (ii) 565 MW8 (19%) coal-fired system units;&#13;
and (iii) 641 MW8 (19%) for CHP units.&#13;
Investment in New Capacity Plants&#13;
13.   Because of the low demand growth and the current excess base-load capacity,&#13;
requirements for new plants are going to be mainly dictated by the retirement&#13;
program. Retirements are in turn dictated by the age and technical condition of&#13;
the existing thermal units, the rehabilitation and environmental requirements,&#13;
and  the  availability  of  a  competitive  primary  fuel  mix.    Assuming  the&#13;
rehabilitation and retirement program as previously described, the optimization&#13;
model shows the following main results: (i) the Polish power system needs peaking&#13;
capacity: the first 150 MW gas-fired peaking unit is required as early as 1998;&#13;
(ii) without constraint on gas availability, all expansion candidates would use&#13;
gas-fired technology consisting of either peaking turbine units or base-load&#13;
combined-cycle units; and (iii) there is no robust justification for either the&#13;
Mloty pumped storage power plant or the Lower-Vistula hydro-cascade.&#13;
Waste Management&#13;
14.   The investment upgrade required for environmental compliance raises a major&#13;
and growing concern about the recycling and disposal of waste products from power&#13;
plants. First, landfill areas are becoming scarce in Poland and the market for&#13;
usable waste products (such as gypsum) is still very limited. Second, pollution&#13;
controls often change the chemical composition of waste products for landfill,&#13;
which makes them not always in compliance with the local environmental&#13;
regulations.   Third,  if a market for usable waste products is not created,&#13;
investment in waste treatment associated with desulfurization installations is&#13;
no longer justified and the untreated waste products must be disposed of, which&#13;
is a major problem.&#13;
15.   About 13 million tons of waste products (fly ash and bottom ash) from&#13;
system power plants alone are produced annually of which 30% is used in the&#13;
cement industry. The installation of pollution controls in these plants would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3-4&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
increase this amount to about 17 million tons of which 9 million tons could be&#13;
used for building materials if the market for such products is developed.&#13;
Recommendations for the Next Iteration&#13;
16.   The following is a list of the most important issues to address during the&#13;
next iteration of the LCIP, which will be undertaken by PPGC's own-newly&#13;
established IRP unit:&#13;
(a)   An  unambiguous  interpretation  of  the  air  pollution  emission&#13;
standards applicable to power plants is required to permit the power&#13;
sector to plan its investment and ensure compliance on a least-cost&#13;
basis;&#13;
(b)   The combined rehabilitation and environmental upgrade for existing&#13;
power plants should be compared with an alternative gas option,&#13;
assuming initially no constraint on gas supply availability;&#13;
(c)   The environmental compliance upgrade for all power plants with&#13;
operating hours over 120,000 hours that are not candidates for&#13;
rehabilitation must be economically justified;&#13;
(d)   CHP  development  should be  refined,  taking  into  account  local&#13;
optimization. New coal-fired CHP plant should be compared with gas-&#13;
fired combined-cycle, cogeneration alternatives;&#13;
(e)   The implementation schedule for the rehabilitation and environmental&#13;
upgrade of existing plants should be determined using technical-&#13;
economic and site criteria; and&#13;
(f)   The retirement program for power units should be revised using time-&#13;
series of unit performance criteria such as unit efficiencies,&#13;
production costs and load factors during the most recent five years&#13;
of operation.   A schedule for the retirement of existing units&#13;
should be developed accordingly.&#13;
17.   The second iteration of the LCIP will address these issues to permit the&#13;
formulation of policy recommendations on the long-term development of the energy&#13;
sector, especially with respect to the fuel mix for power generation, the trade-&#13;
off between clean coal technologies, environmental upgrade of existing coal-fired&#13;
facilities and increased share of gas for power generation.&#13;

POLAND - POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT&#13;
Project Description&#13;
A. The Program&#13;
1.    Satisfactory performance of the Polish power system can only be achieved&#13;
by ensuring a self-sufficient and reliable system. With respect to the power&#13;
transmission network, this involves a comprehensive medium-term program&#13;
consisting of urgently needed rehabilitation and reinforcement of existing&#13;
facilities (lines and substations), combined with a long-term functional&#13;
reconfiguration of the high voltage 400, 220 and 110 kV networks. The proposed&#13;
project recognizes the current sub-transmission function of the 110 kV level and&#13;
the need to implement immediate rehabilitation investments at this level, in&#13;
conjunction with reinforcement at the 400 and 220 kV levels (via 400/110 kV and&#13;
220/110 kV transformation).&#13;
2.    PPGC's total investment program for the period 1995-2001 will consist of&#13;
the following three priority components plus technical assistance:&#13;
(a)   the  Ostrow  transmission  development,  which  consists  of  the&#13;
reinforcement of the national 400 kV network in the Ostrow area to&#13;
facilitate network interties and maintain export and import&#13;
capability, to alleviate the expected power deficit of the southern&#13;
and western regions and the weakness of the present ties of these&#13;
regions to the rest of the Polish power network and to ensure that&#13;
(n-l) UCPTE reliability criterion1l are met;&#13;
(b)   the substation modernization program, which consists of: (i) the&#13;
modernization of twenty two strategic substations in the western and&#13;
central-western regions of Poland (including a complete upgrading&#13;
and modernization of the major substation Mikulowa) to meet the&#13;
design performance levels required for system reliability and&#13;
international interconnections; and (ii) distributed shunt reactive&#13;
compensation at specific substations, to ensure steady voltage&#13;
control and avoid having to switch off 400 kV lines under light load&#13;
conditions;&#13;
(c)   the 220 kV line modernization program, which consists of urgently&#13;
needed rehabilitation and upgrading of eighteen 220 kV lines to&#13;
achieve satisfactory overall system performance levels and&#13;
interconnect major substations for dispatch purposes; and&#13;
1/    The (n-1) criterion is that a power system must be able to maintain its supply and demand balance even in&#13;
case of an outage of a major network operating element (the largest generation plant, or one transmission&#13;
line, or one transformer, or in some instances one busbar).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4-1&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
(d)   technical assistance in selected areas of project and financial&#13;
management, integrated resource planning and training, as required.&#13;
B. The Project&#13;
3.    The proposed project constitutes a major part of PPGC's total investment&#13;
program. The Bank loan would finance those components within the substation and&#13;
line modernization program for which procurement-related activities can start&#13;
immediately or have already been started.  Hence, the Bank would finance the&#13;
faster disbursing components plus technical assistance and would exclude the&#13;
Ostrow  transmission  development  which  has  a  longer  lead  time  than  the&#13;
implementation of the other project components.   The program and the Bank-&#13;
financed components are presented in Annex 4-2. Table 2.&#13;
Substation Modernization Program&#13;
4.    When establishing the development priorities of the program, the following&#13;
system risk factors were considered: (i) the risk of catastrophic failure of&#13;
equipment and possible consequential damage; (ii) the risk of equipment failing&#13;
to perform its assigned function and the impact of this upon network security;&#13;
(iii) the risk of widespread network shutdown and associated loss of load; (iv)&#13;
the extent to which system performance is impaired and the ability to meet&#13;
performance demands of the PPGC and UCPTE networks; (v) the degree of&#13;
obsolescence of the equipment, and its performance record; and (vi) the&#13;
availability of spare parts or lack thereof. For each substation, these risk&#13;
factors were then considered with respect to major substation equipment,&#13;
protective relaying and communications, and substation control. A total of 22&#13;
substations, including Mikulowa, have been identified as being in need for urgent&#13;
upgrading and modernization. Electricite de France (EdF) provided an independent&#13;
technical review of the substation modernization program and confirmed the&#13;
modernization priorities and the scope of works required. The benefits of such&#13;
a program, compared with the existing system performance, are that a greater&#13;
power transfer level across existing facilities would be achieved because of the&#13;
use of faster fault clearing times. In this manner the load transfer capability&#13;
and stability of the network would be enhanced.&#13;
5.    Classification of Modernization Requirements.   The extent of the work&#13;
required is governed by factors such as performance, age of equipment, and system&#13;
stress imposed and may be categorized as follows:&#13;
(a)   Category 1:  Equipment needing modernization as dictated by new&#13;
design criteria and which demand rapid, secure fault clearing times,&#13;
hence higher speed circuit breakers and protective relaying as well&#13;
as duplication of equipment to ensure reliable fault detection and&#13;
clearance;&#13;
(b)   Category 2: Refurbishment of substations as dictated by an increase&#13;
in network stresses, e.g., fault levels, which may require changing&#13;
of circuit breakers and other primary equipment;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4-1&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
(c)   Category 3:  Replacement of primary and secondary equipment as a&#13;
result of inadequate performance, high failure rates, lack of&#13;
spares, high maintenance costs, vintage of equipment, and design and&#13;
performance limitations; and&#13;
(d)   Category 4:  Replacement of primary equipment which is likely to&#13;
fail and result in significant consequential damages, or present a&#13;
safety hazard to operating staff or even the public.&#13;
6.    400 kV Substations.  The measures required for the 400 kV substations are&#13;
principally of the category 1 type, comprising modernization of the primary and&#13;
secondary facilities, although in some instances category 3 refurbishment is&#13;
required, i.e., replacement of the airblast circuit breakers, together with old&#13;
type current transformers of Russian manufacture. Protective relaying schemes&#13;
also require modernization, particularly the provision of busbar zone protection&#13;
where category 3 remedial action is required.&#13;
7.    220 kV Substations.  The measures to be taken at the 220 kV substations&#13;
fall into categories 3 and 4, comprising urgently needed replacement of primary&#13;
apparatus, together with modernization of the secondary equipment.&#13;
8.    110 kV Substations.   The modernization and refurbishment of the 110 kV&#13;
substations is urgently needed, since many are in categories 3 and 4. At bulk&#13;
power supply points in the 400 and 220 kV systems, a slowly cleared fault at 110&#13;
kV may impair the stability of a significant section of the 400 or 220 kV overlay&#13;
networks. It will be essential, therefore, to coordinate the refurbishment of&#13;
all stations within a particular supply area on an overall network basis, rather&#13;
than upgrade only the 400 and 220 kV system. While a program in this area is&#13;
being developed by PPGC for the entire 110 kV network, it is being addressed for&#13;
the substations included in this project.&#13;
9.    Reactive Compensation.  Five shunt reactors with a total reactive capacity&#13;
of 250 MVAr will be installed at specific substations to permit distributed&#13;
reactive compensation of the 400 kV network. This would ensure steady voltage&#13;
control and avoid having to switch off 400 kV lines under light load conditions.&#13;
10.   Telecommunications and Control Systems.   Each substation is currently&#13;
manually controlled by on-site operators.   The proposed substation upgrading&#13;
program would also involve the installation of a computerized system at most of&#13;
the substations for the control of switching apparatus, monitoring of the&#13;
equipment and provision of alarm systems, together with an integral fault&#13;
monitoring and recording system for the total substation.  This computerized&#13;
system will serve as interface with the national and regional dispatching centers&#13;
utilizing a modern telecommunications system through a fiber optic ground wire&#13;
link, with a power line carrier as a backup communications link.  This will&#13;
permit remote control of the substations from the dispatching centers in addition&#13;
to local control at the substations.&#13;
11.   Environmental  Considerations.    At  each  of  the  stations,  adequate&#13;
environmental protection measures will be taken.   Noise suppression will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4-1&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
provided by using screen walls at those locations considered to be noisy.&#13;
Provision of transformer oil retention facilities at the site, together with a&#13;
fire deluge system to contain transformer fires, would also be provided for under&#13;
this program.&#13;
Mikulowa 400/220/110 kV Substation&#13;
12.   The Mikulowa substation is at a key location not only within the Polish&#13;
power grid but also for the interconnections with adjacent countries and hence&#13;
the UCPTE network.   It serves to interconnect the German and Polish 400 kV&#13;
networks as well as the 220 kV networks in the southwest of Poland, while also&#13;
providing the point of connection for the 2000 MWe output from the lignite-fired&#13;
Turow plant.   This power plant will be undergoing major modernization and&#13;
environmental upgrading, with units 8,9 and 10 being the first ones to be&#13;
upgraded. Once these units are refurbished, they will be dedicated to export&#13;
power to Germany in order to pay for the plant upgrading.&#13;
13.   The planned development at Mikulowa substation demands a high security&#13;
station, with rapid clearing of faults at both 400 and 220 kV, together with a&#13;
modern telecommunications system to the national and regional dispatching&#13;
centers, recognizing the national and international power system requirements.&#13;
The modernization program must be implemented without impairing either the sale&#13;
of firm export power or security of supply within the Polish power grid.&#13;
14.   At the 400 kV Level.   Modernization of this level is required for the&#13;
following reasons: (i) to upgrade performance to meet UCPTE criteria; (ii) to&#13;
permit power export once the Turow power plant is modernized and retrofitted with&#13;
flue gas desulfurization systems; (iii) to facilitate reinforcement of the Polish&#13;
power grid in the southwestern area of the country; (iv) to serve as a power&#13;
export point at 400 kV to the Czech Republic; and (v) to permit power export for&#13;
the next two to three years when the ties to the former East German power system&#13;
are interrupted.   The rehabilitation requires a virtual rebuild of the total&#13;
substation from the point of view of both primary and secondary equipment.&#13;
15.   At the 220 kV Level.   Refurbishment at this level is required for the&#13;
following reasons: (i) the performance must be upgraded to meet UCPTE criteria;&#13;
(ii) the primary apparatus must be replaced as it poses a risk of failure that&#13;
jeopardizes the security of the 220 kV network; (iii) the secondary equipment is&#13;
technically obsolete and does not provide the dependability or security of&#13;
operation required by the Polish power and UCPTE systems; (iv) the station must&#13;
be virtually rebuilt, particularly if it is required to operate as a single unit&#13;
rather than as a split busbar station; and (v) it is required to provide secure,&#13;
reliable operation, while serving as the focal point for power transmission at&#13;
220 kV in both an east-west and north-south direction, and as back up to single&#13;
circuit 400 kV lines in this area of the Polish power grid. Twenty five bays of&#13;
primary and secondary switchgear equipment must be modernized and upgraded.&#13;
16.   At the 110 kV Level.    Modernization at this level is required for the&#13;
following reasons: (i) the prevailing fault level is much greater than the rating&#13;
of the installed equipment, even though the station is run with split busbar; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4-1&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
(ii) the equipment is very old, and is unlikely to be capable to perform its&#13;
assigned rating. Of the three stations at Mikulowa, the 110 kV is of greatest&#13;
concern with respect to safety of operation. This substation is to be replaced&#13;
in its entirety and increased significantly in size to comprise a station having&#13;
22 switchgear bays of which 17 would be required in the initial stage.   The&#13;
complete substation, including foundations, will be replaced by constructing a&#13;
new substation alongside the existing one and changing over circuit terminations&#13;
once bays in the new substations are available.   This will result in split&#13;
operation of the 110 kV system during the upgrade period.&#13;
17.   Telecommunications and Control Systems.   A completely new computerized&#13;
distributed control system will be provided in the substation, with complete&#13;
modernization of the telecommunications system to permit remote supervision and&#13;
control from the national and regional dispatching centers. Fiber optic ground&#13;
wire link will be provided, with an upgrade of the existing power line carrier&#13;
link to act as a standby backup communications system.&#13;
18.   Technical Issues.  The existing switching schemes will be retained and the&#13;
modernization will be carried out in stages.   This will result in temporary&#13;
sectionalising of the 400, 220 and 110 kV systems to an even greater extent than&#13;
required to allow for dedication of generation to Germany.   There will be a&#13;
significant risk of loss of load on the Polish grid during this period&#13;
particularly for an (n-l) contingency, recognizing that neither the Ostrow&#13;
development nor the Dobrzen-Swiebodzice 400 kV lines will be in service. The&#13;
scope of work at this substation, together with the difficult interfaces for&#13;
staging construction at the station as well as at the power plant, dictates that&#13;
this modernization be considered as a separate sub-component within the&#13;
modernization program and that a dedicated project management team be&#13;
established. The complete station 400/220/110 kV may be refurbished on a turnkey&#13;
basis.  The work will be scheduled to be coordinated with planned outages in&#13;
connection with the modernization of the Turow plant.&#13;
19.   Alternative Technology Option - Gas Insulated Switchgear.  Extensive civil&#13;
and engineering work is required at Mikulowa. Based on the present design and&#13;
modernization plans, it is estimated that four and a half years would be required&#13;
to complete the total upgrading at Mikulowa.  Using gas insulated switchgear&#13;
(GIS) technology for the total substation or for a part of the substation would&#13;
permit minimizing the outage requirements and shorten the construction period.&#13;
The use of GIS technology would provide an opportunity to purchase 400, 220 and&#13;
110 kV switchgear on an individual turnkey basis, with a well defined scope of&#13;
work and minimal economic risk, as the complete station can be constructed and&#13;
commissioned without the need for significant outages other than those required&#13;
for  termination  circuits.    The  overall  construction  schedule  would  be&#13;
significantly reduced as construction work can proceed without impediment. While&#13;
the capital cost may be higher than the design currently developed, it may well&#13;
be an economically more viable solution when compared to the turnkey solution for&#13;
the modernization based on the design currently developed. A partial solution&#13;
that uses GIS at only one voltage level, e.g. 110 kV, may be also appropriate.&#13;
A definitive project schedule will be developed when a specific contract&#13;
strategy, defined mostly by the modernization technology considered, has been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4-1&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
adopted. Provision was made in the project cost estimates for the possibility&#13;
to use GIS technology at Mikulowa, should this option be economically viable.&#13;
220 kV Une Modernization Program&#13;
20.   PPGC carried out a detailed investigation of the condition of the 220 kV&#13;
transmission lines and identified the degree of modernization, upgrading and&#13;
refurbishment required in order to restore them to a state that would provide a&#13;
further 30-35 years of service. The remedial work may be classified into the&#13;
following groups: (i) the transmission line towers, foundations, and insulating&#13;
structures are in poor condition so that the security of the line is jeopardized;&#13;
(ii) the cross section of the phase conductors is inadequate for the current&#13;
rating required by the present power transfer needs of the system, or the&#13;
existing conductor has corroded and is in need of replacement; (iii) the existing&#13;
ground wires are corroded and unsuitable for further service and in addition, do&#13;
not have the capacity to withstand circuit faults; and (iv) the modernization of&#13;
the telecommunications system throughout the Polish power network is essential&#13;
and can be combined with the replacement of the ground wires through the&#13;
installation of a fiber optic ground wire cable.&#13;
Bank-Financed Equipment&#13;
21.   The Bank-financed equipment items will be procured in accordance with&#13;
Bank's procurement procedures. For the substations, and for different voltage&#13;
levels (400, 220 and 110 kV), the list of equipment comprises: (i) power&#13;
transformers; (ii) switchyard equipment consisting of circuit breakers,&#13;
disconnectors and related operating mechanisms, earthing switching systems,&#13;
current transformers, voltage transformers, surge arresters, secondary circuits&#13;
for bays and transformers, busbar and failure protection systems; (iii) 110 kV&#13;
cables; (iv) auxiliary equipment; (v) shunt reactors; and (vi) telecommunication&#13;
and telecontrol equipment.   For the lines, the list of equipment consists of&#13;
towers, insulators (long rod unit type for the lines to be modernized),&#13;
conductors, ground wires, fiber optic ground wires and repeater stations. The&#13;
equipment quantities and the procurement arrangements are presented in Annex 4-3.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
22.   The proposed project would also finance technical assistance and training&#13;
for PPGC staff as required.   An amount of about US$3.3 million has been&#13;
incorporated into the loan amount for this purpose. Training needs are expected&#13;
to be more pronounced in the management and commercial areas (corporate financial&#13;
planning and management, budgeting, accounting, project economics, contracting&#13;
and international trade, marketing and consumer services, and human resource&#13;
management) than in the strictly technical area. However, a certain amount of&#13;
training for the technical staff will de facto be provided by the suppliers of&#13;
equipment and goods to be procured under the project. The technical assistance&#13;
program is entirely flexible, to permit reorientation towards high priority areas&#13;
that may emerge during project implementation.&#13;

POLAND - POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
1.    The focus of the economic analysis is on the entire investment program of&#13;
PPGC, of which the proposed project is an integral part. This is mainly because&#13;
the benefits associated with the investment components under the project cannot&#13;
be quantitatively measured in isolation from other components of the program,&#13;
unless arbitrary assumptions on allocating the benefits to each component are&#13;
made. The internal economic rate of return (ERR) is, therefore, calculated on&#13;
the basis of the incremental benefit and cost streams connected with the 1995-&#13;
2001 time-slice of the total investment program. The Bank project covers the&#13;
highest priority components in this program and is crucial for the undertaking&#13;
of the remaining part of the program.&#13;
Economic Benefits&#13;
2.    Qualitative Analysis.  The economic benefits associated with the entire&#13;
investment program can be summarized, inter alia, in the following qualitative&#13;
terms:&#13;
a.    Enhanced reliability of the transmission system: the reinforcement&#13;
and rehabilitation of existing transmission lines and substations,&#13;
especially at the 220 kV and 110 kV level, and functional&#13;
reconfiguration of all high voltage lines and substations included&#13;
in the program will improve the reliability of the transmission&#13;
system and reduce network outages and the cost to the Polish economy&#13;
of energy not served.   The reliability of electricity supply is&#13;
vital for electricity-dependent industries (such as high technology&#13;
and chemical industries). Unless the reliability is up to a basic&#13;
standard these industries will have to invest in expensive standby&#13;
power  generation  facilities  to  guarantee   their  continuous&#13;
production.     Additionally,  compared  to  neighboring/competing&#13;
countries, a more reliable electricity supply is also a factor that&#13;
could induce foreign investment in industries in Poland;&#13;
b.    Reduced transmission losses and operation and maintenance costs:&#13;
compared to modern Western transmission systems, the Polish system&#13;
experiences much higher transmission losses and operation and&#13;
maintenance costs. Its obsolete equipment is very inefficient and&#13;
frequent maintenance is needed to keep it performing at an&#13;
acceptable level.   The proposed investment program will greatly&#13;
increase the efficiency of the overall network performance through&#13;
replacement, upgrading and rehabilitation of power transmission&#13;
equipment, improved power system dispatch and better maintenance&#13;
scheduling;&#13;
c.    Deferred and reduced investments in transmission and generation&#13;
capacity and reserve margins due to increased capacity of&#13;
rehabilitated system components: the implementation of the proposed&#13;
investment program will increase the transfer capacity of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6-1&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
transmission network and thus reduce or defer transmission&#13;
investments.   The investment program can also reduce or defer&#13;
investment in generation capacity through a reduced need for&#13;
spinning reserve and standby capacity. This would result from the&#13;
installation of modern telecommunication and control equipment and&#13;
reduced peaking capacity and reserve margins through proposed&#13;
interconnection with UCPTE;&#13;
d.    Increased income from Dower wheeling and exports:   the proposed&#13;
interconnections with UCPTE and neighboring countries provide the&#13;
necessary basis for Poland to be actively involved in electricity&#13;
trade in Europe, thus generating more income for the economy. The&#13;
upgrade to UCPTE standards under the program would permit to&#13;
maintain the power exports to Germany; and&#13;
e.    Reduced environmental pollution: investments in transmission network&#13;
optimization will make it possible to supply power from the most&#13;
efficient coal-fired generation units rather than the less efficient&#13;
ones.    This  improved  dispatching  will  decrease  overall  coal&#13;
combustion while generating the same amount of electricity, and thus&#13;
reduce air pollution. The proposed investments would also permit&#13;
the modernization and environmental upgrade of highly polluting&#13;
power plants without interruption of power supply. The introduction&#13;
of environmental dispatching, which can be achieved by the&#13;
installation of telecommunication and control equipment as proposed&#13;
in the program, would further reduce environmental pollution.&#13;
3.    Quantitative Analysis.  For the purpose of the ERR calculation, PPGC's&#13;
incremental transmission revenue is used as a proxy for the quantifiable economic&#13;
benefits of its investment program and operations.   It is an estimate of the&#13;
consumer's willingness to pay.  Transmission revenue is regarded only as the&#13;
minimum measure of the actual benefits, since this revenue reflects only a&#13;
portion of the total benefits of PPGC's investment program. In particular, this&#13;
revenue-based measurement does not capture the incremental consumer surplus. The&#13;
ERR calculation, including cost and benefit streams and assumptions, is shown in&#13;
Table 6.1. An explanation of the ERR calculation with reference to the benefit&#13;
items listed in Table 6.1 is provided in paras. 4-5.&#13;
4.    Incremental transmission revenues were based on the difference between&#13;
revenues with and without the program. With the program, PPGC would be able to&#13;
ensure firm power contracts for exports to Austria and Czech Republic (item 5.1&#13;
of Table 6.1) and domestic sales (items 5.2 and 5.3 of Table 6.1) and maintain&#13;
power exports to Germany (item 9 of Table 6.1). Without the program, a portion&#13;
of PPGC's domestic sales and export contracts would be supplied on an&#13;
interruptible basis and at lower contract price, and the entire exports to&#13;
Germany would cease, resulting in lost revenues for the company. Interruptible&#13;
contracts valued at about 50% of prices for firm contracts would affect about 30%&#13;
of 1995 domestic sales, the entire incremental domestic sales (in excess of the&#13;
base year 1995 demand) and the entire exports to Austria and Czech Republic.&#13;
Incremental revenues from domestic sales and exports were valued using a&#13;
transmission revenue of about US$14/MWh and a net export revenue of about&#13;
US$84/MWh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6-1&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
5.    Other quantifiable benefits made possible by implementing the program&#13;
comprise: (i) reduction in ordered capacity for spinning reserves and standby&#13;
capacity by about 2% of annual peak demand per year (or 540 MW./year) valued at&#13;
marginal cost of generation capacity of US$53/kW-year (item 6 of Table 6.1); (ii)&#13;
reduction in incremental operating and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs estimated as 2%&#13;
of the value of the existing assets annually (item 8 of Table 6.1); and (iii)&#13;
savings equivalent to about US$ 14 million per year due to transmission system&#13;
reinforcement and covering reduced unsupplied demand (during the winter period&#13;
mainly), a better use of merit-order dispatch resulting in lower generation&#13;
costs, and reduced transmission losses (item 7 of Table 6.1).   Savings from&#13;
system reinforcement were estimated from the results of the load flow analysis&#13;
and the probabilistic simulation of supply reliability with and without the&#13;
reinforcement.&#13;
Economic Costs&#13;
6.    The costs associated with PPGC's investment program and used for the ERR&#13;
calculation comprise: (i) the total costs of the investment program over the&#13;
period 1995-2001, excluding price contingencies, custom duties and taxes, and&#13;
interests during construction (item 2 of Table 6.1); and (ii) the corresponding&#13;
annual incremental O&amp;M costs, estimated as 2% of the cumulative capital&#13;
investment costs (item 3 of Table 6.1). Other costs such as incremental overhead&#13;
costs for implementing the program were assumed to be offset by the reduction in&#13;
manpower requirements at substation level resulting from the improved&#13;
telecommunication and telecontrol of substations. Estimates of the local and&#13;
foreign costs are in March 1994 prices. Local costs are either directly costed&#13;
in international prices or are converted to US dollars using the average 1994&#13;
exchange rate.&#13;
Economic Rate of Return&#13;
7.    The program yields an economic rate of return of 21%.  The ERR reflects the&#13;
implementation of the program during 1995-2001. Benefits from exports to Germany&#13;
are achieved only upon implementing the entire program and remain constant&#13;
thereafter for 15 years (the assumed economic useful life of the investment).&#13;
Other program benefits and incremental costs build up in proportion to the&#13;
progress of program implementation, from 8% in 1995 to the full value in 2001,&#13;
and remain constant thereafter for 15 years (item 1 of Table 6.1). Transmission&#13;
revenue and net export revenue in 1995 were kept constant in real terms.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
8.    The internal economic rate of return, based on the benefit and cost streams&#13;
discussed above,  is estimated at 21%, which is above the 12% discount rate&#13;
generally applied to Poland. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the&#13;
robustness of the ERR. The ERR would go down to 12% if investment costs were to&#13;
increase by 50%, or if all quantifiable benefits were to decrease by 40%.  A&#13;
combination of 20% higher investments costs and 25% lower benefits would decrease&#13;
the ERR to 12%. The ERR is also affected, to a lesser degree, by changes in the&#13;
price for interruptible contracts: if this price increases from 50% to 90% of the&#13;
price for firm contracts, the ERR would go down to 12%.&#13;

            The Power Transmission Project's
            objectives are to: 1) improve the reliability of the
            existing high voltage grid through rehabilitation and
            reinforcement; 2) enhance security of power supply in Poland
            by interconnecting the Polish power grid with that of
            Western Europe, thus improving Poland's power trade and
            wheeling capability; 3) improve the network's
            operational performance and control through transmission and
            loss reduction and improved dispatching, thereby enhancing
            energy conservation and efficiency; 4) reduce environmental
            pollution; and 5) enhance the Polish Power Grid
            Company's (PPGC) institutional capabilities. The
            project comprises the following major components: 1)
            substation modernization program, consisting of the
            modernization of strategic substations in the Western and
            Central-Western regions of Poland to meet the design
            performance levels required for the system reliability and
            international interconnections and shunt reactive
            compensation at specific substations to ensure steady
            voltage control; 2) the 220 kilovolt line modernization
            program; and 3) technical assistance to PPGC.
