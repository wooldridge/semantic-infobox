ï»¿ANNEX I OF THRE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT&#13;
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT&#13;
Description of the Project&#13;
I. Background information&#13;
Building on the institutional capacity developed under the EU IPA financed Serbia Innovation&#13;
Project (SIP), the Delegation of th( European Union (EUD) and the Government of the Republic&#13;
of Serbia (GoS) requested the Inter iational Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) to&#13;
administer the Serbia Research, Imovation and Technology Transfer Project (SRITTP). The&#13;
SRITTP will provide technical assistance to design and pilot elements of the Republic of&#13;
Serbia's innovation system to (i) facilitate commercialization of public sector research and&#13;
development (R&amp;D), (ii) support collaborative research between public sector R&amp;D&#13;
organizations and private industry, and (iii) facilitate strategic planning to enhance the Republic&#13;
of Serbia's competitive positioning in the European research community.&#13;
The Republic of Serbia seeks to enhance the impact of innovation to its economy through&#13;
support to private sector innovative- initiatives and reforms of public research and development&#13;
institutions (RDIs). Research and development spending, though higher when compared with&#13;
other countries in the Balkans, is heavily concentrated in the public sector. The Republic of&#13;
Serbia's focus in recent years has been on establishing an institutional framework and enacting&#13;
regulatory reforms necessary to su )port research and innovation. Considerable investments have&#13;
been made to improve R&amp;D infras ructure. Serbian research outputs, while high when compared&#13;
with the Western Balkans regio.i, appear modest by EU standards. Innovation outcomes,&#13;
however, remain minimal and Serbian R&amp;D activities generate little economic value. Weak&#13;
innovation outcomes are likely r,-lated to limited institutional capacity, poor incentives for&#13;
commercialization and weak puHlic-private collaboration in R&amp;D. The IBRD successfully&#13;
established an innovation policy d alog with the Serbian authorities as part of the private sector&#13;
development agenda. Notable re. ults have been observed under the SIP. Serbian research&#13;
institutes have expressed interest n developing capacity for applied R&amp;D, technology transfer&#13;
and commercialization. As the R,-public of Serbia prepares for European Union integration,&#13;
improving the efficiency of the public research sector will be paramount. In summary these are&#13;
some of the key sector characteristics that provide the rationale for the Project activities&#13;
identified below.&#13;
The IBRD has prepared the SRI-TP on the basis of a comprehensive Project Concept Note&#13;
("CN") which (i) contains additional conceptual details on the Project, (ii) the Commission finds&#13;
acceptable, and (iii) has been del vered to the Commission together with this Administration&#13;
Agreement, for reference purposes&#13;
II. Project Objective and Compoients&#13;
The objective of Project is to fac litate re-orientation of the public research sector toward the&#13;
needs of the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿The Project will support a framework for increasing the efficiency of future investments in&#13;
research and innovation in Serbia and will consist of the following Parts:&#13;
Part A. Establishment of a Techrology Transfer Facility (Recipient-Executed)&#13;
(a) Support for the establishmeni of a centralized Technology Transfer Facility (TTF) with&#13;
international and local experts, inc luding but not limited to, legal matters and at least 5 science&#13;
and technology areas affiliated with the Innovation Fund (IF).&#13;
(b) Support for local Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs), R&amp;D and innovation support&#13;
organizations, and local technolog / transfer institutions, selected pursuant to criteria set forth in&#13;
the Project Operations Manual, tc enhance their capacity to consummate deals. Training and&#13;
workshops will be organized to facilitate this, where relevant.&#13;
Once established, the TTF will work with existing TTOs to build their transactional capacity for&#13;
technology transfer. The TTF wil deploy relevant services in order to elicit disclosures from&#13;
inventors, conduct prior art anal-sis (screening of the disclosure), intellectual property (IP)&#13;
landscape analysis, market analysis, scout for potential licenses, determine the most promising&#13;
commercialization route (e.g. cont-act research, licensing, spin-off creation, etc.), and negotiate&#13;
deals with industry or investors. ks applicable, the TTF will also support selected interested&#13;
TTOs to develop functions of an Office of Contract Research (OCR) including exploring in-&#13;
licensing of technologies from ab road or managing research contracts with industry partners.&#13;
Additionally, the TTF will provide support function to the Ministry of Education and Science&#13;
and Technological Development MOESTD) to promote the utilization of EU Horizon 2020&#13;
program resources among innovati ie enterprises.&#13;
(c) Carry out Project visibility ever ts and workshops, including but not limited to: Project&#13;
launch, call for proposals, Project (losing, workshops to promote awareness about&#13;
entrepreneurship, innovation, techr ology transfer and commercialization, EU innovation policy&#13;
and grant programs (such as, for e ample Horizon 2020 or consortium programs); as well as&#13;
networking events for academia, ei itrepreneurs, and private investors.&#13;
Part B. Provision of Technical Assistance for the: (i) design of a Collaborative R&amp;D Grant&#13;
Scheme with relevant monitorin, indicators, and (ii) an independent annual evaluation of&#13;
Grant Scheme implementation. (Bank-Executed)&#13;
(a) Design a Collaborative R&amp;D Grant Scheme to be later managed by the IF to foster pre-&#13;
competitive industry-driven researh.&#13;
The IBRD will leverage international good practice in grant scheme design that encourages&#13;
stakeholders to increase collaborative R&amp;D activities, as well as to utilize existing infrastructure&#13;
in public sector R&amp;D institutions. The scheme's design could support relevant stages of the&#13;
R&amp;D cycle, from laboratory and I refeasibility studies to prototyping and proof of concept with&#13;
an emphasis on projects that are e port oriented and have potential for internationalization. The&#13;
IBRD will also recommend relev;nt monitoring indicators for the Grant Scheme for inclusion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿into the IF's existing monitoring and evaluation system. The IBRD will also conduct an annual&#13;
independent evaluation of the Grar t Scheme's implementation.&#13;
Part C. Provision of Technical Assistance for the Development of an R&amp;D and Innovation&#13;
Strategy, an R&amp;D Infrastructu re Roadmap and corresponding Action Plan(s) (Bank-&#13;
Executed)&#13;
(a) Inputs into the design and preparation of an R&amp;D and Innovation Strategy and Action&#13;
Plan. The IBRD will provide technical and analytical inputs to MoESTD, which is&#13;
responsible for the R&amp;D and Jrnovation Strategy preparation.&#13;
Inputs may include fieldwork to collect and assess stakeholder priorities, review existing&#13;
programs, and conduct needs .ssessment. It is envisioned that a cross-sector working group&#13;
will be established to support p ublic consultations and strategy preparation.&#13;
(b) Inputs into an R&amp;D Infrastucture Roadmap and Action Plan. The IBRD will provide&#13;
technical and analytical inputs for the development of an R&amp;D Infrastructure Roadmap to&#13;
complement the R&amp;D and Inn :vation Strategy and to serve as a guide for policymakers on&#13;
science, technology and innov tion.&#13;
The Roadmap is expected to outline research infrastructure needs of Serbian science for the&#13;
next 5-7 years, and identify aras for synergy in the innovation system to facilitate effective&#13;
use of public funds. The Roadi nap is also meant to identify opportunities to leverage broader&#13;
European research infrastruciure. Similar to the Strategy, the Infrastructure Roadmap&#13;
development will be led by t ie Ministry with guidance on the development process and&#13;
technical and analytic inputs fr )m the IBRD.&#13;
(c) Technical Assistance for Strategy and Roadmap Implementation. The IBRD will provide&#13;
targeted technical assistance  o MoESTD to support strategy dissemination and provide&#13;
inputs for the drafting of legal documents to adopt legislative and regulatory changes needed&#13;
