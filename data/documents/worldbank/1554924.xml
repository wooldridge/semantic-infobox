ABSTRACT OF T HE STUDY&#13;
This paper analyses the validity of several well established propositions&#13;
in the theory of exhaustible resources in the presence of substitutes. By care-&#13;
fully modelling the technologies of resource extraction and substitute production,&#13;
we show that:&#13;
(a) Despite its widespread acceptance in the literature, the basic pro-&#13;
position that a reduction (an increase) in the rate of discount leads&#13;
to greater conservation (faster depletion) of an exhaustible resource&#13;
is not generally valid. It is shown that the effect of a change in the&#13;
discount rate on the rate of resource depletion depends on capital&#13;
requirements for development and production of the substitute, capital&#13;
requirements in resource extraction and the size of the resource stock.&#13;
(b) When there are decreasing returns in production of the substitute,&#13;
the conventional propostion that a relatively high-cost substitute&#13;
should not be utilized before the stock of the resource is exhausted&#13;
is invalid. It is shown that in such cases the optimality requires&#13;
that both the resource and substitute be produced simultaneously for&#13;
some period of time.&#13;
(c) When substitute technology shows increasing returns to scale, the&#13;
conventionalproposition that the marginal cost of the substitute&#13;
provides a ceiling for the price of the exhaustible resource does not&#13;
hold. We show that, under such conditions there will be a time interval&#13;
during which the price of the resource exceeds the marginal cost of&#13;
the substitute and yet the substitute ought not to be introduced during&#13;
that interval.&#13;
(d) When there are a number of substitutes for the resource, each having&#13;
a different marginal production cost and a different fixed cost&#13;
associated with its development and introduction, the conventional&#13;
rule that "the substitute with the lowest marginal cost of production&#13;
should be introduced first" is not generally valid. We derive a more&#13;
general decision rule which requires one to develop and introduce&#13;
the substitute which yields the largest flow of net social benefit per&#13;
time period regardless of its effect on the value of the resource&#13;
stock.&#13;

I. Introduction&#13;
The succession of sharp price increases of       oil in the early&#13;
1970's raised, quite naturally, the issue of (a) competition against OPEC&#13;
as a supplier of oil and (b) competition against oil as a form of energy.&#13;
The object of this paper is to consider the latter form of competition.&#13;
Specifically, we will analyse the validity of several well established&#13;
propositions in the theory of exhaustible resources in the presence of a&#13;
substitute for the resource.&#13;
A key concept in many discussions of the problems of exhaustible&#13;
resources is that of the "backstop technology". The concept was given&#13;
prominence by Nordhaus(1973), who examined, empirically, the long run problem&#13;
of switching from cheap but exhaustible sources of energy to more expensive&#13;
but abundant forms.   He assumed the existence of a technology which has an&#13;
effectively non-exhaustible resource base, but can be used to produce a&#13;
perfect substitute for the resource at possibly very high costs. The important&#13;
question, then, is whether the cost of producing the backstop provides a&#13;
ceiling on the price of exhaustible resource such as oil- a question which&#13;
has become of some importance since the events of the early 1970's. The&#13;
conventional wisdom, undoubtedly, is that it does. Thus, in an influential&#13;
paper, Solow(1974,p.4) writes as follows:&#13;
"Suppose that, somewhere in the background, there is a&#13;
technology capable of producing or substituting for a&#13;
mineral resource at relatively high cost, but on an&#13;
effectively inexhaustible resource base. Nordhaus calls&#13;
this a "backstop technology". (The nearest we now have&#13;
to such a thing is the breeder reactor using U23 as&#13;
fuel. World reserves of U238 are thought to be enough&#13;
to provide energy for over a million years at current&#13;
rates of consumption. If that is not a backstop&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
technology, it is at least a catcher who will not&#13;
allow a lot of passed balls. For a better approx-&#13;
imation, we must wait for controlled nuclear fusion&#13;
or direct use of solar energy. The sun will not&#13;
last for ever, but it will last at least as long as&#13;
we do, more or less by definition.) Since there is&#13;
no scarcity rent to grow exponentially, the backstop&#13;
technology can operate as soon as the market price&#13;
rises enough to cover its extraction costs (including,&#13;
of course, profit in capital equipment involved in&#13;
production). And as soon as that happens, the market&#13;
price of the ore or its substitute stop rising. The&#13;
backstop technology provides a ceiling for the market&#13;
price of the natural resource."&#13;
(Emphasis added)&#13;
It is Solow's(1974) last proposition, in the above quote, that we wish&#13;
to investigate further.  Despite the faith shown in it by the literature on&#13;
exhaustible resources, in the analysis of this paper it is shown that,&#13;
under certain conditions, this proposition does not hold. A careful modelling&#13;
of the production technoZogy of the substitute shows that the conventional&#13;
wisdcm can indeed be misleading if not wrong. The implications of a question-&#13;
ing of this basic proposition are certainly interesting, and are also discussed&#13;
in the sequel.&#13;
A careful modelling of the production technology of the substitute also&#13;
leads us to question one other central proposition in the economics of exhaust-&#13;
ible resources. This is the proposition that the rate of depletion of an&#13;
exhaustible resource is positively related to the rate of interest-. This&#13;
proposition goes back to the classic work of Hotelling(1931), and is important&#13;
in the current literature, particularly in the discussion of whether the rates&#13;
of extraction of exhaustible resources are "too high" from a social point of&#13;
view. Thus Solow(1974,p.8), referring to Hotelling's(1931) work, writes as&#13;
follows:&#13;
"Hotelling mentions, but rather pooh-poohs, the notion&#13;
that market rates of interest might exceed the rate&#13;
at which society would wish to discount future utilities&#13;
or consumer surpluses. I think a modern economist would&#13;
take that possibility more seriously. It is certainly&#13;
a potentially important question, because the discount&#13;
rate determines the whole tilt of the equilibrium produc-&#13;
tion schedule. If it is true that the market rate of&#13;
interest exceeds the social rate of time preference,&#13;
1/   For a formal proof of this proposition, see Koopmans (1974).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3-&#13;
then scarcity rents and market prices will rise faster&#13;
than they "ought to" and production will have to fall&#13;
correspondingly faster along the demand curve. Thus&#13;
the resource will be expZoited too fast and exhausted&#13;
too soon."                           (Emphasis added)&#13;
Similarly, Kay and Mirrlees(1975,p.163) have argued that&#13;
a general bias in the economy to consume now and&#13;
leave too little to our children or our future selves...&#13;
would be reflected in high rates of interest, which wiZl&#13;
Lead to somewhat more rapid depletion of resources."&#13;
(Emphasis added)&#13;
An explicit statement of the comparative static proposition implicit in&#13;
the above arguments is provided byMeade(1975,p.117)&#13;
"This reduction in the market rate of interest ...&#13;
would stimulate investment in oil-in-the ground to&#13;
carry oil over from this year's consumption to next&#13;
year's consumption, or, in other words, it would&#13;
encourage the conservation in the ground of oiZ which&#13;
wouZd otherwise have been pumped for use this year."&#13;
(Emphasis added)&#13;
We wish to investigate the validity of the above comparative static&#13;
proposition, which is without doubt a central one in the economic theory&#13;
of exhaustible resources. Using a model of resource extraction in the&#13;
presence of a substitute which is itself produced using capital and labour&#13;
we show that, under certain conditions, this basic proposition is not&#13;
generally true- the effects of a change in the rate of interest on the&#13;
costs of producing the substitute may be strong enough to invalidate the&#13;
conventional wisdom.&#13;
The plan of this paper is as follows. In Section II we develop a&#13;
simple resource-substitute model to argue that, in spite of a widespread&#13;
belief in it, the proposition that a reduction (increase) in the rate of&#13;
interest would lead to a slower (faster) depletion of exhaustible resources&#13;
is not generally valid. We show that, for exhaustible resources, the&#13;
allocational implication of a change in the discount rate depends on capital&#13;
requirements for the development and production of the substitute, capital&#13;
costs in resource extraction, and the size of the resource stock, in particular.&#13;
In Section III, based on the model of Section II and data on comparative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
costs of energy from alternative sources, we provide a numerical example&#13;
which demonstrates that for plausible parameter values the effect of a&#13;
change in the discount rate is indeed opposite to that conventionally thought.&#13;
To analyse the implications of economies or diseconomies of scale in&#13;
production of the substitute, in Section IV we set the basic optimisation problem&#13;
of Section II in a more general form and derive the first-order conditions&#13;
for optimality. We then show in Section V that when there are decreasing&#13;
returns in production of the substitute, it is no longer true (as often&#13;
argued) that a relatively high-cost substitute for the resource should be&#13;
utilised only after the stock of the resource is exhausted. In Section VI&#13;
it will be shown that with increasing returns in production of the substitute,&#13;
the marginal cost of the substitute does not (as widely believed) provide&#13;
a ceiling for the price of the exhaustible resource, and therefore that the&#13;
elimination of a differential between the price of the resource and the&#13;
marginal cost of the substitute does not provide a sufficient reason for&#13;
introducing the substitute. Section VII considers a situation where one has&#13;
to choose among several technologies which are all capable of producing a&#13;
perfect substitute for the resource, but that they differ in their unit&#13;
production costs and in the fixed costs associated with their development&#13;
and introduction. It will be shown that in such cases the conventional rule&#13;
that 'the substitute with lowest marginal production cost should be introduced&#13;
first' does not give the correct answer. We show that for such cases the&#13;
optimal decision rule requires one to choose that technology which yields&#13;
the largest flow of net benefit from use of the substitute regardless of its&#13;
impact on the value of the stock of exhaustible resource. Finally, Section&#13;
VIII will present a summary of the paper and some concluding remarks.&#13;

II. Exhaustible Resource Depletion and the Rate of Discount&#13;
Consider a socially planned economy which has the following characteristics:&#13;
C1- it is endowed with a known finite stock of an exhaustible resource, S.&#13;
C2- there is an extraction technology which, foz the sake of simplicity, is&#13;
assumed to possess constant returns to scale and to remain unchanged over&#13;
time. Given this technology and the set of input prices in the economy, the&#13;
unit cost of resource extraction can be described by the following cost&#13;
function&#13;
c = c(w,r)                                              (II.1)&#13;
where c is the minimum cost of extracting a unit of the resource at any&#13;
time, r is the price of capital per unit, and w is the vector of prices of&#13;
all other inputs.&#13;
The cost functions used hereafter are taken to be continuous in their argue-&#13;
ments and at least twice continuously differentiable.&#13;
C3- the social benefit from the use of the resource is measured, in monetary&#13;
units, by V(pt) , where&#13;
v(p t)  U(x(pt))                                         (II.2)&#13;
and where Pt denotes the price of a unit of the resource at time t , and&#13;
x(pt)  is the market demand function which is assumed to satisfy  x' (p t) &lt; 0&#13;
and to avoid corner problems, lim   x(p ) = 0 ,and  lim    x(p ) ' X&#13;
Pt-,.00  t            Pt-,O   t&#13;
Assuming that the marginal utility of income is constant, the gross social&#13;
benefit (consumer surplus) is therefore evaluated from the market demand&#13;
fanction according to   U(x)   fXp(x)dx  , where  p(x)  is the inverse of&#13;
.o&#13;
the demand function  x(p). Given the definition of U(x) and the assumption&#13;
that x (pt) &lt; 0 , it is clear that U (x) &gt; 0 and U (x) &lt; 0 . Moreover,&#13;
differentiating ( II.2 ) w.r.t. Pt and noting that U (x) = p(x), we have&#13;
I          I&#13;
V (Pt= ptx (pt                                           (II.3)&#13;
We shall presently introduce a perfect substitute for the resource, so that&#13;
(II.2) and (II.3) should be interpreted as referring to both the resource&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
and its substitute.&#13;
C4- future social benefits are discounted at a constant rate which, on the&#13;
assumption that capital markets are perfect, is equal to both the market&#13;
rate of interest and the cost of capital.-&#13;
C - following Nordhaus (1973), we assume that the technology of the economy&#13;
allows the production of a perfect substitute for the exhaustible resource&#13;
possibly at a cost which is higher than the current price of the resource,&#13;
but on an effectively inexhaustible resource base. For instance, we can&#13;
think of crude oil as the exhaustible resource and the breeder reactor as&#13;
an approximation to the substitute technology. We shall take it that the&#13;
econcmy has already access to this technology and that there is no capacity&#13;
constraint on production of the substitute. For expository convenience, and&#13;
without loss of generality, we also assume that returns to scale in production&#13;
of the substitute are constant, so that the unit cost of production of the&#13;
substitute can be written as&#13;
p = p(w,r)                                               (II.4)&#13;
where p is the minimum production cost per unit of the substitute which, for&#13;
any given set of factor prices, exceeds the unit extraction cost of the&#13;
resource, c.2/&#13;
The problem facing the planners in such an economy is that of choosing&#13;
the price path of the resource  pt   and the date  T  at which the substitute&#13;
should replace the resource so as to maximise W , the present net social&#13;
benefit from the depletion of the resource stock and the use of the substitute.&#13;
1/ For an analysis of the relationship between the social rate of&#13;
discount, the pure rate of social time preference and the market rate&#13;
of interest, see Stiglitz (1977 ) and (1978 ).&#13;
2/ Needless to mention, if p &lt; c the resource stcck will never be used,&#13;
and if p=c the resource and substitute can be considered to be homo-&#13;
genous and thus treated as a single good.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
Formally, the planners' problem is-/&#13;
maximise  w - f e     [V(p )-x(p )c(w,r)]dt + f   e rV(p )-x(p )p(w,r)Jdt&#13;

subject to the constraints                                              (11.5)&#13;
0f x(p )dt &lt; S , x(p ) &gt; O , and Pt &gt; Â° for all t &gt; O&#13;
0  t     &lt;S     xp=O&#13;
Forming the Lagrangean associated with problem (II.5), differentiating it&#13;
w.r.t.  Pt and   T , and using (11.3) we obtain the following necessary conditions&#13;
for an optimum:l/&#13;
Pt - c(w,r) =   Xe     ,     tE[O,T]                       (II.5.a)&#13;
Pt = p(w,r)            ,     ts[T,m)                       (II.5.b)&#13;
and          fT x(p )dt = S                                             (II.5.c)&#13;
0     t&#13;
where  X = pO - c(w,r)   is the Lagrangean multiplier and measures the initial&#13;
scarcity rent (price minus extraction cost) on the resource.&#13;
The optimal policy governed by conditions (II.5.a)-(II.5.c) is familiar&#13;
in the literature (see, e.g. Dasgupta and Stiglitz (1976)).It requires that&#13;
the scarcity rent on the exhaustible resource rises at the rate of discount&#13;
until the resource price has risen sufficiently to cover the marginal cost&#13;
of production of the substitute, at which time the stock of the resource is&#13;
completely depleted and the substitute will be supplied at a price equal to&#13;
its marginal cost of production p(w,r) and at a constant flow rate of&#13;
x(p(w,r)) units3-/&#13;
However, to gain further insight into the properties of the optimal policy&#13;
1/  It should be noted that in setting problem (II.5) we have assumed that&#13;
the economy will use up the stock of the resource before it switches to&#13;
the substitute. That this is indeed the optimum order in which the&#13;
resource and substitute should be used is formally demonstrated in&#13;
Section (V.1).&#13;
2/  For details of the derivation of these conditions,see Appendix A.2.&#13;
3/ That the optimal price path should be continuous at t=T must be obvious,&#13;
for otherwise either the resource will be undercut by the substitute, or&#13;
it will pay to hold back some of the resource stock, no matter how small,&#13;
until time T when capital gains are huge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
and, in particular, to facilitate the subsequent analyses, it is necessary&#13;
to provide some comparative static results concerning the effect of an&#13;
exogenous change in the production cost of the substitute, the extraction&#13;
cost of the resource, or the size of the resource stock on the optimum rate&#13;
of resource depletion and the timing of the substitute. Towards this, let&#13;
us use (II.S.a) and (II.5.b) to write&#13;
p(w,r) - c(w,r) =   XerT                                   (II.5.d)&#13;
As we are concerned, for the time being, with the effects of exogenous changes&#13;
in the costs (which may result, for instance, from changes in the technology&#13;
of production/extraction), we can treat the unit costs as parameters and&#13;
denote them respectively by p and c. Then, for given input prices (w,r),&#13;
total differentiation of (II.5.c) and (II.5.d) leads to the following information:&#13;
0T &gt;    ,   apo ,O ,- x    &gt; o                             (II.5.e)&#13;
ap          aP         DP&#13;
aT  &gt;   ,   apO    O ,&#142; ax  &lt;0                             (II.5.f)&#13;
aT  ,    ,T0ax             &lt;0                              (II.5.g)&#13;
as          as         as&#13;
where  p  is the optimal initial price of the resource (for the derivation&#13;
of these results see Appendix A.1).&#13;
According to (II.5.e) an increase in the unit cost of the substitute&#13;
delays the date at which the economy switches from the resource to the&#13;
substitute, slows down the rate of resource exploitation, and benefits the&#13;
resource owners by enabling them to collect larger amounts of royalties at&#13;
any time. A rise in the unit cost of extraction has the same qualitative&#13;
effects except that it reduces the rents accruing to resource owners. Obviously,&#13;
these effects will be reversed for a reduction in the unit costs; thus, for&#13;
example, a cost-reducing technological breakthrough in either the substitute&#13;
or the resource sector speeds up the rate of resource extraction and advances&#13;
the date of utilisation of the substitute.&#13;

The interpretation of inequalities (II.5.g) is straightforward.&#13;
An addition to the existing reserves of the resource reduces the scarcity&#13;
rent and hence the price of the resource. In the limiting case where the&#13;
size of the resource stock becomes infinitely large the scarcity rent tends&#13;
to zero, thus implying that the price of the resource in that case will be&#13;
equal to its marginal cost of extraction. This is akin to economic intuition,&#13;
for as the stock of the resource becomes very large the resource becomes&#13;
pretty much like a conventional inexhaustible commodity, in which case the&#13;
efficiency considerations dictate that the resource be priced at its marginal&#13;
extraction cost. Since this statement proves to be essential in the analysis&#13;
of the subsequent section, we may as well present a formal proof of it here.&#13;
This is as follows.                                             1 ln[(p-c)/X]&#13;
r            r&#13;
Using (II.5.d) and (II.5.a), we can rewrite (II.5.c) as         x(c+ Xert)dt =&#13;
which implies that for all   S &gt; 0 , p-c &gt; A &gt; 0 . Furthermore, (from (A.l.l.e)),&#13;
a   -   x    &lt; 0  for all   S &gt; 0 ,so that  A  is a positive decreasing function&#13;
of  S . Now, the limit of    A  , as  S-- ,cannot be positive; for suppose&#13;
lim      A  &gt; O    , then, as  S     , the integral on the LHS of the resource&#13;
S - x&#13;
stock equation obtains a finite limit, whereas the RHS of the equation goes&#13;
to infinity, thereby leading to a contradiction.   Therefore, lim   A  = 0&#13;
_                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~S -0 co&#13;
implying that pt c     as  S - -&#13;
It is worth noting that eventhough an addition to the reserves of the&#13;
resource lowers its price and thus brings about higher rates of consumption&#13;
per unit of time, it prolongs the time span over which the reserves are depleted&#13;
(i.e. as  &gt; 0).  This is because, regardZess of the size of the reserves, the&#13;
price of the resource at the time of exhausti6n must have risen high enough&#13;
to cover the marginal cost of the substitute, thereby giving rise to a smooth&#13;
transition from the resource to the substitute. But, since the initial price&#13;
of the resource is lowered (due to an addition to the resource stock) it will&#13;
take a longer time before the resource price reaches the level of the marginal&#13;
cost of the substitute.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
From a comparison of the inequalities involving the term p0 I it is&#13;
seen that cost-reducing technological progress in the substitute and/or the&#13;
resource sector is tantamount to additions to the existing reserves of the&#13;
resource, so that higher levels of resource consumption can be achieved&#13;
during the interval [0,T] either as a consequence of cost-reducing technological&#13;
progress or as a result of discoveries of new reserves of the exhaustible&#13;
resource.&#13;
Let us now turn to the analysis of the effect of a change in the discount&#13;
rate on the optimal rate of resource exploitation. Bearing in mind that both&#13;
unit costs p(w,r) and c(w,r) are functions of the rate of interest, we can&#13;
DX&#13;
differentiate (II.5.c) and (II.5.d) with respect to    r  and solve for  ar  to get&#13;
ax = AC (et(          ac ) + r  c  rT X' (p )dt - S]/x(p0)         (11.6)&#13;
where, for the simplicity of exposition, the arguments of the unit cost&#13;
functions have been supressed. Recalling that pO       X + c(w,r)  and using&#13;
(11.6) we have, after some manipulation&#13;
Xx(p)          + rac     T e-rt   (&#13;
=PO  [AX(P-  ae  + r  aC rT e   x(pt)dt - XS]/x(p              (11.7)&#13;
From the theory of cost functions1/we know that    ap  and  DC    in (11.7)&#13;
indicate respectively the capital requirement per unit (or capital intensity)&#13;
of the substitute and resource. It is therefore evident that the capital&#13;
intensities in the two sectors play an important part in determining the effect&#13;
of a change in the rate of discount on the intertemporal allocation of the&#13;
resource, and that their effects are such that a reduction in the rate of&#13;
discount could result in a faster extraction of resources (disinvestment in&#13;
resource-in-the-ground). This runs counter to the conventional proposition&#13;
that a lower discount rate unambiguously leads to conservation of exhaustible&#13;
resources. The intuitive belief in this proposition might have been derived&#13;
y/ See, e.g., Shephard (1970)-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
from the following two unrealistic assumptions: (a) that there exists no&#13;
potential substitute for the resource (this, in effect, leads to the exclu-&#13;
sion of the term ap from (II.7)), and (b) that there are no costs whatsoever&#13;
involved in the extraction of the resource (this has the effect of eliminating&#13;
the term a from (II.7)). Alternatively, it might have been derived from&#13;
unguided intuition that the act of keeping resources in the ground is an&#13;
investment activity identical to any other form of investment, so that, ceteris&#13;
paribus, a "reduction in the rate of interest ... would stimulate investment&#13;
in oil-in-the-ground". But, as our analysis has indicated, a reduction in&#13;
the rate of discount brings about two counteracting effects: (a) in as much&#13;
as the discount rate reflects the rate of time preference, a reduction acts&#13;
to postpone the use of resources to the future (a conservation effect), and&#13;
(b) as cost of capital, it lowers the unit costs in both the substitute and&#13;
resource sectors, and hence it induces a faster rate of resource depletion(a&#13;
disinvestment effect).-/ The net effect depends, among other things, on the&#13;
degree of capital intensities in the substitute and resource sectors, the cost&#13;
differential between the substitute and the resource, and the size of the&#13;
resource stock.&#13;
One can take the analysis further and use (II.7) to derive a general&#13;
condition that unambiguously determines the qualitative role of the discount&#13;
rate in the allocation of exhaustible resources. To do this, let&#13;
K  Ef   e  t [rx(p ) a-] dt                              (II.7.a)&#13;
R   0            t   Dr&#13;
and          K               = fe    [rx(p)        dt                  (II.7.b)&#13;
S    p-c   ar    T               ar&#13;
1/  It may be noted that although a reduction in   r will reduce capital&#13;
costs in the two sectors, in a general equilibrium context, other factor&#13;
prices will also change, so that not all costs will necessarily fall.&#13;
However, provided that the resource and substitute sectors are more&#13;
capital intensive than other sectors of the economy, a reduction in r&#13;
will definitely reduce the production/extraction costs in the two sectors.&#13;
As far as energy industry is concerned, the available statistics suggest&#13;
that this proviso is indeed fulfilled. For example, Leontief's (1956)&#13;
statistics on direct and indirect capital requirements suggest that the&#13;
crude oil and natural gas industry's capital intensity is higher than&#13;
those in the durable goods industries by a factor of 1 to 1.5. McDonald&#13;
(1976) has also calculated a capital intensity of 1.43 for the U.S. oil&#13;
and gas industry as compared to a capital intensity of 0.52 for manufacturing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
where  KR and  KS msasure respectively the present value of capital require-&#13;
ments in the resource and substitute sectors. Also, substituting from (II.5.a)-&#13;
and (II.5.b) for Pt in (II.5) to obtain the maximised value of W (denoted&#13;
by  W ), differentiating   W* w.r.t.   5, and making use of (I.3),(A.l.l.e)&#13;
and (A.l.l.f) we have&#13;
T w s                                                     (II.7.c)&#13;
where  A  is the shadow price of a unit of the resource stock in the ground&#13;
and AS is the present social value of the resource stock.&#13;
Using (II.7.a)-(II.7.c), we can then rewrite (II.7) as&#13;
= [ (K  + KS) - XS]/x(p0)                             (1I.8)&#13;
which implies that&#13;
apo &gt;&#13;
= -  as  (K. + K) &lt;    XS                             (11.9)&#13;
We can therefore state the following proposition.&#13;
Proposition 1. A reduction in the discount rate leads to a more r=pid depletion&#13;
of resources if the sum of the present values of capital requirements in the&#13;
substitute and resource sectors exceeds the present value of the resource&#13;
stock.&#13;
This result, which is the basic finding of this section, has not been&#13;
discussed in the literature which, as we have indicated above, has suggested&#13;
that the effect is unambiguous, a faster depletion of resources always being&#13;
caused by a rise and never a reduction in the discount rate.&#13;
In practice, whether the required condition holds or not depends obviously&#13;
on actual magnitudes of parameters which determine K , KS , and AS; namely,&#13;
on the size of the stock of the exhaustible resource in question, S , the unit&#13;
costs of production of the substitute and extraction of the resource, p and&#13;
c , the capital intensities ,   d   and   ,c the rate of discount , r , and&#13;
the demand for the resource/substitute , x(pt) . Nonetheless, from (II.7) it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
is clear that the condition will be satisfied if the cost differential&#13;
(p-c) is sufficiently small. It is also obvious from (II.7) that the&#13;
condition will hold if the capital intensities of the substitute and/or&#13;
the resource are sufficiently large. What is,however, less obvious is&#13;
whether the condition will hold when the resource stock is large or when it&#13;
is small. This is an important question because if it turns out that 'P &gt; 0&#13;
when the stock of the resource is sufficiently small, then reducing the&#13;
discount rate in the belief that it will lead to greater conservation of the&#13;
resource (which is the effect conventionally conceived) will result in adverse&#13;
effects which are probably far more serious than they will if    Â°__ &gt; O holds&#13;
for sufficiently large stocks of the resource.&#13;
Let us therefore examine the values of   S   for which condition K R+K -AS&gt; 0&#13;
holds. First, we study the behaviour of AS as a function of S. It will&#13;
be noted that&#13;
lim  A(S) - p-c                                           (II.l0.a)&#13;
S -B 0&#13;
and          lim   A(S) = 0                                             (II.l0.b)&#13;
S -).0&#13;
where the former follows directly from (II.5.c) and (II.5.d), and the latter&#13;
was formally established above (see page 29).&#13;
Hence, from (II.l0.a), we have&#13;
lim  A(S)S = 0                                            (II.l1)&#13;
S 0 o&#13;
Noting that   lim A(S) = 0 , the limiting value of   A(S)S  as  S     can be&#13;
S - X&#13;
calculated using L   Hospital s Rule:&#13;
S             (A(S)) 2&#13;
lim A(S)S = lim      1    = lim&#13;
s  XJ co    s -? X  1       s-C     a xs )&#13;
A(S)              S&#13;
But, from (A.l.l.e) of Appendix A.1,&#13;
a     = _    X(S) &lt; Â°                                     (11.12)&#13;
so that, by substituting (II.12) in the above expression and recalling that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
p o   c + X(S) , we obtain&#13;
iim  X(S)s     -rnim   [X(S)x(c+X(s))J&#13;
S  -D. co        S -0- 0&#13;
which, using (II.lO.b), gives&#13;
rim  X(S)s = 0                                               (II.13)&#13;
Now, differentiating XS with respect to S and using (11.12) yields&#13;
s =  s   + A     =  X(l  rS&#13;
TS     as    x           x(PO)&#13;
so that,      axs   &gt;  O    as     S     t  )&#13;
TS   7                 5    r&#13;
Thus, the graph of    XS  starts from the origin, rises with     S  until it&#13;
x(p)&#13;
attains its maximum for    S = -.Â°    , and then it declines while approaching&#13;
r&#13;
the S-axis asymptotically (see Diagram l.a below).&#13;
Next, we investigate the behaviour of     KR and   Ks as functions of    S&#13;
Noting that   lim   T = 0 , and   lim  T =    (by (II.5.c),(II.lO.a) and (II.l0.b)),&#13;
S  - o-             S  -   c&#13;
we can use definitions (II.7.a) and (II.7.b) to write&#13;
lim  KR =     ,  lim   K     (P a&#13;
54-. 0           S  0&#13;
ac&#13;
lim  KR = x(c)T      ,  and    i    K S&#13;
so that,      lim (KR + K5) = x     Dp)                                    (II.14.a)&#13;
and           lim (KR + K ) =x(c)-r                                        (II.14.b)&#13;
Now, differentiating (KR+ KS) with respect to      S , and substituting for      aT&#13;
and  ax    respectively from (A.l.l.e) and (A.l.1.f), we obtain&#13;
as&#13;
a(KR+ KS) = r-          (   (K+K )]                          (II.15)&#13;
TSk(S           Dr     x(p0)  R    S&#13;
which, on manipulating the expression for (K-R+ KS), can also be written in&#13;
the form of                                                                   (1.1&#13;
re [K3+KS  areo         ac e   ST- x  ptert&#13;
0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Also, from (II.15) we have the second-order derivative&#13;
as            X (Po)   x(p0) Ts (XR       asKR    S&#13;
Since  x (p ) &lt; 0   and  aX &lt; 0 , it follows that&#13;
a (KR+                a -2 (K +K ) &gt; 0                      (II.16)&#13;
~*s(K                 a ~   s2  R s&#13;
so that whenever (KR + K S) happens to be declining, it will continue to do so&#13;
until it reaches a minimum at K + KS = x(p      ac  (from (II.15)).&#13;
R  K5=xp)       -  (rm    1.5)&#13;
Finally, on taking the limit of (11.15) as S- 0 , and using (II.lO.a) and&#13;
(II.14.a), we obtain&#13;
lim  as (KR + KS) = r(.a -  ar)                           (11.17)&#13;
We have now enough information to study the behaviour of (K + KS) for&#13;
various cases which may arise, depending on whether the capital intensity of&#13;
the substitute is greater, equal to, or smaller than that of the resource.&#13;
Case (a):  (2 &gt; ac    (i.e. the substitute is more capital intensive than&#13;
ar   ar&#13;
the resource.)&#13;
For this case, (11.17) and (II.16) together imply that the graph of&#13;
(KR + K), starting from x(p)ap , will decline until it attains its minimum&#13;
(x(P );c ); thereafter it rises with S and passes through an inflexion&#13;
point before it   asymptotically approaches  x(c)     (see Diagram l.a)-.&#13;

however be noted that the graph of (KR+K )   behaves   as described&#13;
above, regardless of whether   x(p).2N &lt;=      c&#13;

In this case, - (K +     ) &gt; 0 , V S &gt; 0 (by (II.15')), so that (K +K&#13;
TS KR   S                                          KR   S&#13;
always rises with S , and passes through an inflexion point before it reaches&#13;
its upper bound (x(c) a ) asymptotically (see Diagram (l.b))-.&#13;

Thus our analysis indicates that the requirement for -      &gt; 0  to hold&#13;
is fulfilled both when the resource stock is sufficiently small (i.e. for&#13;
S &lt; Si in Diagrams l.a and l.b) as well as when it is sufficiently large&#13;
(i.e. for S &gt; S2)- and this independently of whether it is the substitute&#13;
or resource which is more capital intensive. In either case, the effect of&#13;
a change in the discount rate on the price, and hence the pace of exploitation&#13;
of the resource will be opposite to that conventionally believed.&#13;
The economic intuition behind this result is quite simple. As was pointed&#13;
out earlier, when the stock of resource is very large, the resource is much&#13;
like an ordinary product for which the price is determined by the marginal&#13;
cost of production; as such, a reduction in the rate of interest renders the&#13;
resource cheaper and hence increases its rate of use. In the opposite case,&#13;
when the stock of resource is very small, the resource can enjoy a scarcity&#13;
1/ Note that both Diagrams (l.a) and (l.b) have been drawn on the assumption&#13;
that the point of maximum on curve   AS  lies above the curve of   (K R+ KS)&#13;
In general, this need not be the case, and the curve    AS  may lie&#13;
entirely below the curve of (K R KS).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
rent almost as large as the difference between the cost of producing the&#13;
substitute and its own cost of extraction, implying that it will command&#13;
a price roughly equal to production cost of the substitute. In that case,&#13;
a reduction in the rate of interest reduces the cost of the substitute, and&#13;
hence the price obtainable by the resource; leading therefore to a faster&#13;
use of the resource. However, if for any reason greater conservation of the&#13;
resource is deemed to be socially desirable, then reducing the discount rate&#13;
to achieve this will have consequences which will be more disturbing if the&#13;
economy in question is resource-poor than if it is resource-rich.&#13;
Given the result of our analysis, the question naturally arises as to&#13;
the plausibility of the sizes of the resource stock for which the inequality&#13;
a 0&gt; 0   (or, equivalently, K + K - XS &gt;0   ) is satisfied.  In other words,&#13;
ar                          R    S&#13;
one would like to know how small   S1 (or how large  S 2) should actually be&#13;
in order for the adverse effects of a change in the discount rate to occur.&#13;
In order to have an idea of the orders of magnitude involved, we shall consider&#13;
a numerical example in the following section.&#13;
III. A Numerical ExamDle&#13;
In constructing the numerical example, we have taken the demand for the&#13;
services of the resource/substitute to be iso-elastic with a long run price&#13;
elasticity of unity. Normalising for the units of measurement, this can be&#13;
written as&#13;
x(p ) = p1                                                (III.1)&#13;
Let a and a denote, respectively, the percentage shares of capital cost&#13;
in production costs of the resource and substitute; so that, by the assumption&#13;
of constant returns to scale, we have-&#13;
cr c  = a         0 &lt; a &lt;1                                (111.2)&#13;
r Tr&#13;
r ;d  =           0&lt;    &lt;1                                (II1.3)&#13;
noted&#13;
1/  It should be/that for simplicity of exoosition we have supressed the&#13;
factor price arguments of the unit cost functions p(w,r) and c(w,r).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18&#13;
Also, let k be the factor by which the cost of the substitute (per unit&#13;
of the resource equivalent) exceeds the unit extraction cost of the resource,i.e.&#13;
p = kc    ,  k &gt; 1                                        (111.4)&#13;
Wa assume that for all factor prices k remains constant, with the implica-&#13;
tion that the capital cost shares in the two sectors will be equal,i.e. a = 8.&#13;
Given the demand function (111.1), we can solve the model of previous&#13;
section for the optimum values of A , T , and p       To do this, we use (I.5a)&#13;
to write (III.1) as&#13;
x(p )    (c+ Aert )-l                                     (III.5)&#13;
t&#13;
Substituting from (III.5) into (II.5.c), performing the integral and using&#13;
(II.5.d) yields&#13;
T = cS + - ln( P&#13;
r     PO&#13;
Also, from (II.5.d),&#13;
T =      In L( P&#13;
r&#13;
and from (II.5.a),&#13;
A = po- c&#13;
Thus, we have three equations in three unknowns ( A,T,p ) which, on&#13;
0&#13;
defiling  X   e e    and using (III.4), can be solved to obtain, after&#13;
manipulation&#13;

T = - ln[kX-(k-l)]&#13;
r&#13;
and       Po     kcX                                                (III.6)&#13;
kx-(k-1)&#13;
Now, by differentiating (III.6) w.r.t. r and simplifying the resulting&#13;
expression, we obtain&#13;
ap        ckX&#13;
0Xr[kx- (k-i)j2akx- a(k-l) - (l+a) (k-1) lnX}&#13;
so that,&#13;
a-r &gt; 0 iff  fakX-a(k-l)-(l+a) (k-l)lnX} &gt; 0             (III.7)&#13;

For given values of parameters k and a , one can determine the&#13;
range of values of X satisfying (III.7); and then, by using these values&#13;
of X and specifying those of  r and   c , one can determine (via X - erc )&#13;
the corresponding range of values of S . 'However, instead of determining&#13;
S&#13;
the range of S , we calculate the range of reserve-production ratio,   -&#13;
x (po)&#13;
which indicates the number of years for which the stock of the resource&#13;
can sustain the initial rate of production. This not only provides a more&#13;
meaningful criterion for judging the plausibility of the 'agnitudes of S&#13;
involved, but also saves us from entering into speculation about the actual&#13;
magnitude of c , for, using the definition of X , (III.1) and (I1I.6), it&#13;
can readily be checked that&#13;

Although our analysis can be applied to all exhaustible resources, in&#13;
arriving at the numerical results reported below we have had energy resources&#13;
in mind, with crude oil as the exhaustible resource. Of course, as a source&#13;
of energy, crude oil is so diversely used- directly, in transportation, heating&#13;
and industrial uses and, indirectly, in generating electricity- that there&#13;
is for it no substitute (at least not at the present state of technological&#13;
knowledge) which is both inexhaustible and capable of replacing it in all&#13;
its variety of uses. For instance, solar energy is inexhaustible, but can&#13;
be substituted for oil mainly ln its use for heating purposes. Similarly,&#13;
controlled nuclear fusion (when it becomes commercially viable) can provide&#13;
an inexhaustible substitute for oil in generating electricity, but not for&#13;
oil used in transportation. The only perfect substitute for crude oil is&#13;
synthetic oil (oil produced from shale, tar sands, and coal). This, strictly&#13;
speaking, is an exhaustible substitute. However, the available reserves of&#13;
the resources on which it is based are so vast, relative to reserves of&#13;
conventional oil, that one can consider it as a reasonable approximation to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
the type of substitute technology envisaged in our analysis-.&#13;
We shall now present the numerical values used for the parameters&#13;
involved. To specify values for k , we need to have information about&#13;
production costs of oil from different energy sources. In a study by Shell&#13;
Oil Company-/, the following figures are given as the estimated cost of&#13;
synthetic oil&#13;
Cost (1979 $)&#13;
per barrel of oil equivalent&#13;
Liquid from oil sands           15-25&#13;
Liquid from shale               15-35&#13;
Liquid from coal (U.S:)         30-37&#13;
* Excluding taxation, refining, and distribution costs.&#13;
These figures should be compared with production cost of oil, estimated by&#13;
the same study at  7-11 (1979 $) for 'medium-cost' fields such as those in&#13;
the United States and North Sea. Taking the midpoint of each range as the&#13;
average cost and calculating the ratios of the average costs of synthetic&#13;
oil to that of conventional oil, we get 2.22 for oil sands, 2.77 for shale,&#13;
and 3.72 for coal.  To allow for possible improvements or drawbacks in synthetic&#13;
1/  For instance, Oil and Gas Journal (1977) puts the estimated U.S. shale&#13;
oil resources at 1.8 trillion (1012) barrels, of each it is estimated&#13;
that 610 billion barrels could be produced by means of current technology.&#13;
This alone would be more than 22 times greater than U.S. proven reserves&#13;
of crude oil (as 1 Jan. 1980) and would be equivalent to a 206 year supply&#13;
at the U.S. 1979 crude oil production rate.&#13;
The figures for coal are even more impressive; the U.S. Geological Survey&#13;
(1975) has estimated total coal resources at almost 4 trillion tons, of&#13;
which at least 218 billion tons (or about 1000 billion barrels of oil&#13;
equivalent) has been estimated as recoverable reserves. This is 37 times&#13;
greater than U.S. proven crude oil reserves and 180 times greater than its&#13;
crude oil consumption (domestic production plus imports) in 1979.&#13;
There are also massive reserves of oil sands concentrated mainly in&#13;
Venezuela and Canada. The Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists (1974)&#13;
has put the estimated reserves of oil sands in these two countries at,&#13;
respectively, 2050 and 800 billion barrels; so that with a recovery factor&#13;
of only 20%, each country's recoverable reserves of oil sands would be&#13;
23 times greater -han its proven reserves of crude oil (as of 1 Jan.1980).&#13;

21&#13;
oil technology, we have let parameter k take values in the range 1.5-4.0&#13;
by steps of 0.5.  Also in calculating - -    , whenever this has been necessary,&#13;
we have used two alternative discount rates of 5% and 10%.&#13;
The numerical results are presented in Table 1 which shows the lower and&#13;
upper ranges of the reserve-production ratios (in number of years) satisfying&#13;
aÂ° &gt; 0 .   Interstingly enough, from the table we see that for a large range&#13;
of values of k and for any plausible value of the capital cost share, a&#13;
the relationship  aPo &gt; 0 holds for alt sizes of the resource stock.    For&#13;
example, with k=1.5 and a capital cost share of greater than only 16.44% the&#13;
relationship holds independently of the stock size. For k=3.5 , it will hold&#13;
for all sizes of the stock if the capital cost share is greater than nearly&#13;
63% , a condition which is by no means stringent for an industry as capital&#13;
intensive as the oil industry in the United States. Even for a substitute&#13;
whose production cost is 4 times higher than that of the resource, the reserve-&#13;
production ratios required to satisfy a-Â° &gt; 0 are seen to be neither un-&#13;
reasonably small nor unduly large. For instance, with a capital cost share&#13;
of 60% and a discount rate of 5% , one requires a reserve-production ratio&#13;
of either less than 13.5 or greater than 28.36 years (at 1979 production levels,&#13;
the crude oil reserve-production ratios for the United States and Canada were,&#13;
respectively, 8.6 and nearly 12 years). At the discount rate of 10% the lower&#13;
range becomes narrower while the upper range becomes wider; however, as the&#13;
capital cost share increases the two ranges get closer to each other, so that&#13;
for a &gt; 72.41%   the inequality -PÂ°&gt; 0     will hold independently of the size&#13;
of the reserves.&#13;
To summarize so far, we have argued that when allowance is made for capital&#13;
costs in production of the substitute and in extraction of the resource, a&#13;
change in the discount rate can affect the rate of resource depletion in a&#13;
direction opposite to that conventionally believed. In particular, it was&#13;
shown that a decrease (an increase) in the discount rate will lead to a faster&#13;
(slower) depletion rate initially if the sum of discounted present values of&#13;

capital requirements for resource extraction and production of the substitute&#13;
exceeds the present value of the stock of the resource.&#13;
Our theoretical analysis showed that this condition will be satisfied not&#13;
only for small sizes of the resource stock but also for large stocks. Indeed,&#13;
the results of our numerical example for energy resources indicated that for&#13;
a wide range of plausible values of the parameters involved, the condition&#13;
will hold for aZZ sizes of the resource stock.&#13;
IV. Resource Depletion and Returns to Scale in Production of the Substitute&#13;
In the previous section, we noted that capital costs in production of&#13;
the substitute play a significant part in deter'mining the impact of a change&#13;
in the discount rate on the pace of resource depletion. Another aspect of&#13;
the substitute production which can have strong implications for both the&#13;
optimal pricing (depletion) of the resource as well as the timing of the&#13;
substitute is the possibility of economies or diseconomies of scale. The&#13;
study of these implications, which is the object of this section, is of impor-&#13;
tance, because both the theoretical and empirical investigations of the optimal&#13;
resource depletion (or pricing) policy in presence of a substitute have usually&#13;
been undertaken on the assumption that the substitute technology shows constant&#13;
returns to scale.&#13;
Hence, with the exception of the assumption of constant returns to scale&#13;
(CRS) in production of the substitute, we shall retain all other assumptions&#13;
made previously. Also, since factor prices (w,r) will remain unchanged through-&#13;
out the analysis, in writing the cost functions we shall suppress them so that&#13;
c and C(yt) now denote, respectively, the unit (marginal) extraction cost&#13;
of the resource and the total production cost of the substitute. Finally, for&#13;
the ease of exposition, in this section we shall consider quantities, rather&#13;
than prices, as the planners' decision variables.&#13;
Thus, written in its general form, the problem confronting the planners&#13;
is now to choose the paths of resource extraction    x t} and substitute Droduc-&#13;

where X is the Lagrangean multiplier.&#13;
The inequalities in (IV.2) and (IV.3) hold with complemantary slackness&#13;
and, together, imply three possible production regimes characterised by&#13;
I                    I r&#13;
&#149;t&gt; 0 , yt = 0      U Cx ) = c + Xert &lt; C (0)              (IV.4)&#13;

t =     Yt &gt;Â°0 : U (Yt)     c C  (Yt) &lt; c + Xert          (IV.6)&#13;
(In what follows, we shall refer to these regimes as R1 , R2 and    R3&#13;
respectively.)L/&#13;
The first question which comes to mind is: In what order should the&#13;
utilisation of the resource and the substitute take place under different&#13;
conditions of returns to scale in production of the substitute? One approach&#13;
to this question could be to examine all possible production policies which&#13;
can arise from various orderings of the regimes R, , R2 and R3 , and then&#13;
identify the optimum policy for various cases of returns to scale. However,&#13;
that will be tedious and unnecessary because, even without specifying the&#13;
conditions of returns to scale, one can at the outset discard a number of&#13;
LX Notice that our earlier assumption about the demand function (see Section II,&#13;
page  5 ) imply that   lim U (z) = X  which automatically rules out the&#13;
Z-)0&#13;
possibility of xt = 0 and y = 0.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
policies as being non-optimal. These will be all policies which do not&#13;
consist of a final phase during which the regime   R3 is active.  This is&#13;
best seen by noting from (IV.6) that as long as the regime   R3 is in action&#13;
the substitute will be produced at a constant flow rate yt = y (where y&#13;
I        I&#13;
is the solution to  U (yt) = C (yt) ) and supplied at a constant price which&#13;
equals its marginal cost of production   C (yt) , so that the flow of the&#13;
net social benefits accruing under the regime   R  will be constant (U(y) -C(y))&#13;
over time. Now, consider any policy which consists of a final phase during&#13;
which a regime other than   R3 (i.e. R  or R 2) is operative.  From (IV.4)&#13;
and (IV.5) it is then seen that along such a policy the supply price of the&#13;
-    rt&#13;
resource/substitute (c++Xe   ) will be rising indefinitely with time, so that&#13;
the consumption of the resource   xt (or the aggregate consumption  xt +yt)&#13;
and hence the flow of social benefits will be declining over time correspondingly.&#13;
This implies the existence of a sufficiently large T such that for all t (T,c)&#13;
the net social benefits from the use of the resource (or the resource and&#13;
substitute) will fall short of [U(y) -C(y)] which would be available if&#13;
during (T,-) the regime  R   were in force.  Therefore, in order for a policy&#13;
to be optimal it is necessary that it involves a final phase during which&#13;
only the substitute is produced.&#13;
This condition reduces the number of candidates for an optimum to only&#13;
two policies, namely those specified by the orderings   R R2R3 and R2R1R3 &#13;
However, the policy characterised by the ordering R R R3 can not be optimal.&#13;
To show this, let   (0,T ) be the time interval during which the regime  R&#13;
is in operation.  Then, at time T1 when R2 terminates, it should be the case&#13;
that either  YT = 0 or  xT = 0     In the former case, one would have (from&#13;
I        -      rT&#13;
(IV.4))  U (xT ) = c +  Xe   = C (0) , in which case for all   t&gt;T&#13;
I    -     rt    I&#13;
U (x )   c + Xe   &gt; C (0).   But this contradicts condition (IV.4) which must&#13;
be satisfied whenever the regime  R1 is operative.   So,'R -followed-by R1'&#13;
is not an optimal sequence.&#13;
In the latter case where  xT -O , one has (from (IV.5)),u (YT       c+Xe 1=C (y7 )&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
in which case  U (yt)   C (yt) &lt; c+ Xe     for all   t &gt; T1. But this is&#13;
the condition which must hold whenever the regime   R3 , and not RI , is&#13;
.~~~~~~~~~~~                          1&#13;
active. Thus, again, R2-followed-by RL can not be an optimal sequence.&#13;
Having ruled out the sequence   R 2RR3 as non-optimal, we are left with   R1R2R3&#13;
as the general order in which different regimas should appear in an optimal&#13;
production/extraction policy.&#13;
This result can now be used to investigate in detail the behaviour of&#13;
the optimum policy under different conditions of returns to scale in produc-&#13;
tion of the substitute. This shall be done in the following two sections&#13;
with the next section devoted to the cases of constant and decreasing returns.&#13;
V. The Optimal Policy when there are Constant or Decreasing Returns in&#13;
Production of the Substitute&#13;
V.1 Constant Returns to Scale (CRS) in Production of the Substitute&#13;
This is the case which has been customarily assumed in all studies which&#13;
have incorporated a substitute for the resource in their analyses and, in&#13;
fact, the optimal policy for it has been already discussed in Section II.-/&#13;
Nevertheless, as the benchmark with which the other cases of returns to scale&#13;
are compared, we present a brief discussion of it here.&#13;
The condition of CRS implies that the marginal cost of the substitute&#13;
is constant, so that, together with the assumption that the substitute is&#13;
more costly than the resource, we have&#13;
I       -   -&#13;
C (y ) =p &gt; c     for all  y  &gt;0                          (V.1)&#13;
t &#13;
where p denotes the marginal cost of the substitute for this case.2/&#13;
Bearing condition (IV.5) in mind, an immediate implication of (V.1) is to&#13;
eliminate the regime   R2 from the optimum ordering  R1R2R3 ; (i.e. the&#13;
possibility of simultaneous production of the resource and substitute).&#13;
1/ Of course, there we simply assumed that the substitute will be introduced&#13;
after the resource is exhausted. Here, this will be demonstrated rigorously.&#13;
2/  It should be perhaps mentioned that throughout we shall be assuming that&#13;
returns to scale are unijorm, i.e. that they will be decreasing, constant,&#13;
or increasing at all production levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
So that the optimal policy for this case is specified by the sequence R1R3'&#13;
Also, recalling that U (z) = p(z) , and using conditions (IV.4) and (IV.6)&#13;
describing regimes  R  and R    , respectively, it can readily br verified&#13;
that the conditions governing the optimal policy are indeed identical to&#13;
those given by (II.5.a)-(II.5.c) in Section II. The features of the optimal&#13;
policy are also illustrated in Diagram 2.&#13;

The optimal policy under CRS in production&#13;
of the substitute&#13;
V.2 Decreasing Returns to Scale (DRS) in Production of the Substitute&#13;
Under the conditions of DRS, the marginal cost of production will be an&#13;
increasing function of the production rate, i.e.&#13;
it&#13;
(y) &gt;      for all Y   &gt; Â°                             (V.2)&#13;
t                t~f h   susitt&#13;
Moreover, since it is assumed that the production cost of the substitute&#13;
exceeds the extraction cost of the resource, we have&#13;
C (O) &gt; c                                                (V.3)&#13;
Given this information and our previous result that the ordering of&#13;
different regimes along an optimal policy is R1R2R3 , it can readily be&#13;
checked that in the present case the optimal policy is governed by conditions&#13;
(IV.4)-(IV.6). More specifically, the optimal policy will consist of three&#13;
phases. During an initial phase [0,T1] , only the resource will be extracted,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
with the rate of extraction so determined that the net marginal benefit&#13;
from its use rises at the rate of discount (see condition (IV.4)). This&#13;
phase will be in force until such a date T1 at which the price of the&#13;
resource has risen high enough to cover the marginal cost of producing the&#13;
first unit of the substitute, i.e.   U (   )   c+Xe    I= C (0).  Following&#13;
this phase, will be a second phase, tT ,T ] , during which both the resource&#13;
and the substitute will be utilised simuZtaneously. As seen from condition&#13;
(IV.5), during this interval the price of the substitute will be rising; so&#13;
that, to ensure that it is always supplied at a price equal to its marginal&#13;
cost of production, it will be produced at rates which will be increasing&#13;
over the interval. The rate of resource extraction will, on the other hand,&#13;
be falling continuously with time just to ensure that the net marginal benefit&#13;
from the aggregate services of the resource and substitute risesat the rate&#13;
of discount. This second phase will continue to be effective until such a&#13;
time, T2 , at which the stock of the resource is exhausted and the rate of&#13;
extraction falls to zero-. From then onwards, only the substitute will be&#13;
in use, with its rate of production and price remaining constant throughout&#13;
(as determined by the condition U (y) = C (y) ).&#13;
The optimal policy is lucidly portrayed in Diagram 3-/&#13;

The optimal policy under DRS in production&#13;

2/ 1 am grateful to jim Mirrlees for suggesting this diagramatica'&#13;
presentation of the optimal policv.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
That the optimal policy involves a phase during which both the resource&#13;
and the substitute are produced simultaneously is quite interesting, for it&#13;
has been widely believed in the literature that optimality requires that&#13;
the relatively high-cost substitute be introduced only after the resource&#13;
is exhausted. For instance, Dasgupta and Heal (1979,p. 191 ) have argued&#13;
that "As long as the production cost of the substitute exceeds the extraction&#13;
cost of the exhaustible resource the substitute ought not make its appearance&#13;
initially... The resource and the substitute will not be utilised simultaneously,&#13;
but sequentially". However, as our analysis shows, for the case where the&#13;
substitute is produced under the conditions of DRS this proposition is not&#13;
valid, with the implication that under those conditions it would be wrong,&#13;
for example, to postpone the utilisation of nuclear fusion or solar energy&#13;
until the existing reserves of relatively low-cost oil are used up I/ Further-&#13;
more, since our model can be viewed as a limiting case of a situation where&#13;
there are several deposits of the same resource with different marginal&#13;
extraction costs, it follws that if extraction frcm some of these deposits&#13;
is subject to DRS then simultaneous exploitation of deposits will indeed be&#13;
the case.&#13;
Having analysed the main features of the optimal policy under the conditions&#13;
of DRS, we wish now to compare the paths of resource depletion and the dates&#13;
of introduction of the substitute under the conditions of constant and decreas-&#13;
ing returns to scale.  Depending on whether   p -&lt; C y) , three different cases&#13;
may arise. For each case, the comparison can easily be carried out by using&#13;
the optimality conditions (IV.4)-(IV.6) and the fact that the stock of the&#13;
resource is the same under both CRS and DRS. Consequently, we do not present&#13;
the details,but directly su=arize the results as follws.    Letting  Xc  and&#13;
Ad denote the present discounted value of the scarcity rent under,respectively,&#13;
the conditions of constant and decreasing returns, Tc   and  Td  the dates of&#13;
1/ In fact, when the stock of the resource is sufficiently small and/or the&#13;
marginal cost of the initial units of the substitute is sufficiently low&#13;
(so as to support the condition c+X &gt; C'(0)) it will be optimal to&#13;
produce the substitute at al7 points of time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
resource exhaustion, and Ts    the date of utilisation of the substitute,&#13;
it can be shown that if  p &gt; C (y) one has: (a) , Ad &lt; X    implying that&#13;
the pace of resource depletion will be faster if the substitute is produced&#13;
under DRS than under CRS, and (b) , T    &lt; T  , so that the substitute will&#13;
be introduced more quickly if its technology shows DRS than if it exhibits&#13;
CRS-/  For the case where   p &lt; C (y) one has  Td &gt; T  , indicating that the&#13;
resource stock will last longer if production of the substitute is governed&#13;
by the condition of DRS than if it is subject to CRS (although the rate of&#13;
depletion can still be initially faster under the former condition than under&#13;
the latter). Also, as in the previous case, we must have    Ts &lt; T   , which&#13;
enables us to conclude that the substitute will generally be utilised sooner&#13;
if returns to its production are decreasing than if they are constant.&#13;
VI. The Optimal Policy when there are Increasing Returns to Scale (IRS) in&#13;
Production of the Substitute&#13;
Increasing returns to scale implies that the marginal cost of the subs-&#13;
titute decreases with the scale of production, i.e.&#13;
C"(y) &lt;0      for all y    &gt;0                             (VI.1)&#13;
t                      =&#13;
With this condition, the possibility of simultaneous production of the&#13;
resource and the substitute is immediately ruled out, so that, in the light&#13;
of our discussion in Section IV, the optimal policy for this case will be&#13;
characterised by the ordering   RIR3 . That is, it consists of two phases:&#13;
1/ An alternative interpretation of these results could be as follows. Suppose&#13;
the planners are faced with a choice between two substitutes available for&#13;
the resource, where one of the substitutes is produced under the conditions&#13;
of CRS with a marginal production cost of p , while the other is subject to&#13;
DRS and that, if utilised according to an optimal plan, it will in the long-&#13;
run (i.e. after the resource is exhausted) be supplied at a constant flow&#13;
rate y (where U'(y)= C'(y)). Suppose further, that p&gt;C'(y). Then, the&#13;
results stated above, under (a) and (b), imply that the optimal choice would,&#13;
ceteris paribus, be the substitute with DRS in' production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
during an initial phase, [0,T)        the resource will be exploited while&#13;
from T   onwards only the substi      iill be in use.&#13;
Although this sequence is the       as that obtained for the case of CRS,&#13;
the properties of the optimal polic      the present case are distinctively&#13;
different from those described there. ro bring out these properties in a&#13;
clear fashion, it will be more convenient to return to the notation of Section&#13;
II and again consider prices, rather than production levels, as decision&#13;
variables.&#13;
Since we have already shown that during the second phase of the optimal&#13;
policy only the substitute is going to be available, the equilibrium in that&#13;
market entails  yt= x(p t) for all t&gt; T (where as before    x(p t) denotes the&#13;
market demand function). Hence, the production cost of the substitute can&#13;
now be written as C(x(p      , and the problem facing the planners as&#13;
T-rt                       co-rt&#13;

be such that it complies with the efficient    :le of marginal cost pricing-&#13;
Conditions (VI.3.a) and (VI.3.b) are f     amiliar to require further&#13;
1/ For the derivation of these conditions,       Appendix A.2.&#13;
2/  It can be shown that a sufficient condi      for the existence and uniqueness&#13;
of p   satisfying (VI.3.b) is  C"(x) &gt;       , i.e. that the marginal&#13;
utility be diminishing more rapidly tha     a marginal cost of the&#13;
substitute.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32-&#13;
remarks. Condition (VI.3.c), on the other hand, explains all the specific&#13;
features of the optimal policy under IRS, and is rich enough to enable us&#13;
to base a number of arguments upon it. It states that at time T , when&#13;
the resource is exhausted and the substitute is to make its appearance, the&#13;
price of the resource must have risen to such a level that the consumers'&#13;
net benefit from the use of the resource is just equal to the net benefit&#13;
from the services of the substitute, i.e. to such a level which renders&#13;
consumers indifferent between using the resource or having the substitute&#13;
available to them. That level will then constitute the ceiling price for&#13;
the resource.&#13;
An immediate implication of this condition can be stated in the form&#13;
of the following proposition.&#13;
Proposition 2. When there are economies of scale in oroduction of the&#13;
substitute, the price of the resource will exceed the marginal production&#13;
cost of the substitute, so that the latter does not provide a ceiling for&#13;
for the former.&#13;
Proof.   From the assumption of economies of scale, we have&#13;
C(x(p )) &gt; C (X(p ))X(p ) V     x(p   &gt;0&#13;
In particular, for  x(p ) = x(p)&#13;
C (x (p) ) &gt; C ' (x (p) ) x(p&#13;
or, using condition (VI.3.b)&#13;
C(x(p)) &gt; px(p)                                          (VI. 4)&#13;
Now, (VI.4) together with (VI.3.c) implies that&#13;
v (PT) - PT x (p T) &lt; V (p) - px (p)                     (VI.5)&#13;
On the other hand, differentiating [V(p ) -p    x(p  w.r.t.  pt   and using&#13;
(II.3), we have&#13;
d   [V(P ) -P x(p 1 = -x(p ) &lt; 0                         (VI.6)&#13;
dpt     t    t    t        t&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
Therefore, from (VI.5) and (VI.6) it follows that&#13;
PT &gt;                                                      (VI.7)&#13;
as required. | &#13;
Thus, contrary to the cases of diminishing and constant returns to scale&#13;
where the optimal price path is continuous and the economy makes a smooth&#13;
transition from the resource to the substitute, in the present case, the&#13;
transition will not be smooth because at the date of resource exhaustion&#13;
there will be a discontinuous fall in price from PT to p, and hence a&#13;
discontinuous rise in consumption from x(pT) to x(p) (see Diagram 4).&#13;

The optimum price path under IRS in production&#13;
of the substitute&#13;
Furthermore, since   p  &gt; p  and since the resource price rises continu-&#13;
ously over the interval [O,T), there will be always an interval of time&#13;
(T,T) in Diagram 4) during which the price of the resource exceeds the&#13;
marginal cost of the substitute and yet the substitute will not be introduced&#13;
in that interval-. From this it follows that when the substitute is produced&#13;
under the condition of IRS, the erosion of a differential between the marginal&#13;
cost of the sunstitute and the price of the resource does not provide a&#13;
1/ In fact, it can readily be checked that if the stock of the resource is&#13;
sufficiently small, then throughout the resource life the price of the&#13;
resource will be above the marginal cost of the substitute without the&#13;
resource ever being undercut by the substitute.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
sufficient cause for introducing the substitute.&#13;
The reason for not introducing the substitute during (T,T) is simple:&#13;
during this interval the price of the resource, although higher than the&#13;
marginal cost of the substitute, will still be lower than the price which&#13;
renders consumers indifferent between the use of the resource and the&#13;
substitute. Accordingly, consumers will prefer to continue using the resource&#13;
until such a time T at which the resource price has risen to the critical&#13;
level PT.&#13;
As an alternative interpretation of the same event we may consider the&#13;
following. Clearly, with increasing returns in production, pricing the&#13;
substitute at its marginal cost means that a portion of its total cost&#13;
amounting to C(x(p)) - px(p) , can not be covered through its sales.  In the&#13;
absence of any other source to finance these costs, one can imagine that the&#13;
planners turn to the resource sector and raise the initial price of the&#13;
resource above the level which would prevail if the substitute were produced&#13;
under the condition of CRS with a marginal production cost of C' (x(p))= p&#13;
(the optimal price path which would prevail under that condition is shown&#13;
in Diagram 4 by the dashed curve). Of course, the price of the resource&#13;
must be raised optimazlly, i.e. in such a way that the required sum becomes&#13;
available just at the time when the stock of the resource is exhausted. Once&#13;
the price of the resource is raised in this way, the date of exhaustion and,&#13;
hence, introduction of the substitute will be postponed to such a time, T&#13;
sums&#13;
by which the needed/will have been acquired to make production of the subs-&#13;
titute viable.&#13;
The foregoing interpretation brings about the question of whether the&#13;
optimal policy can be attained as the outcome of a competitive equilibrium.&#13;
As is well known, for the cases of diminishing and constant returns in&#13;
production of the substitute, the second theorem of welfare economics ensures&#13;
that possibility. However, when there are increasing returns in production&#13;
of the substitute the matter becomes ccmplicated, for pricing the substitute&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
at its marginal cost entails firms to incur losses. The general problem&#13;
of attaining efficiency in the presence of increasing returns to scale&#13;
has been recently analysed in a general equilibrium framework by Brown&#13;
and Heal (1980),(1981). Interestingly enough, Brown and Heal (1980) show&#13;
that any Pareto-efficient equilibrium can be supported by a system of&#13;
marginal cost pricing with two-parts tariffs whereby consumers pay a fixed&#13;
charge for entering the market for the product produced under conditions&#13;
of increasing returns, and then purchase the product at a price equal to&#13;
1/&#13;
marginal cost-.&#13;
We shall end this section by comparing the paths of resource depletion&#13;
and the dates of utilisation of the substitute under the conditions of&#13;
constant and increasing returns to scale. As before, let p denote the&#13;
marginal (unit) cost of the substitute under conditions of CRS. To facili-&#13;
tate the comparison, we note that as far as the path of resource depletion&#13;
and the date of introduction of the substitute are concerned, a substitute&#13;
which is produced with IRS and is supplied at an optimal price p = C (x(p))&#13;
can be regarded as equivalent to a substitute with CRS but with a marginal&#13;
(unit) cost of  PT , where  PT  is such that it satisfies condition (VI.3.c).&#13;
Bearing this in mind and recalling our earlier comparative-static results&#13;
that -    &gt;0 , -   &gt; 0  (see Section II, page 28 ), it is immediate that as&#13;
ap ~ap&#13;
long as p &lt; PT , increasing returns in production of the substitute leads&#13;
to a more conservative resource depletion policy and delays the utilisation&#13;
of the substitute.&#13;
VII. The Choice Among Several Substitutes with Different Cost Characteristics&#13;
The previous section analysed the features of the optimal extraction&#13;
(pricing) policy for an exhaustible resource in the presence of a substitute&#13;
which is produced under the conditions of IRS. In the present section, we&#13;
1/ As Brown and Heal (1980) have shown, unless one is prepared to make&#13;
restrictive assumptions about consumers' preferences, the fixed charge&#13;
in general varies frcm one person to another, depending on individuals'&#13;
preferences. This clearly leads to problems of preference revelation&#13;
and free-riding, and hence reduces the attractiveness of the system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
use the results of that analysis to provide an answer to the following&#13;
basic question; namely, when there are several technologies capable of&#13;
producing substitutes for the resource, what should be the criterion for&#13;
selecting one as the optimal technology? The importance of this question&#13;
hardly ever needs emphasizing. In fact, following the "oil crisis" of the&#13;
early 1970's, there has been a great deal of debate among energy policy&#13;
makers in the oil-importing industrialised countries as to which one of&#13;
various alternative sources of energy should be developed in order to ease&#13;
the constraint of dependency on foreign oil. For instance, in the United&#13;
States during 1974-1977 the Administration's energy policy insisted on the&#13;
accelerated development of the synthetic fuel technologies (production of&#13;
oil from coal, shale, and tar sands), but this was strongly criticised by&#13;
the Treasury on the grounds of their requiring massive amount of capital&#13;
expenditure; also, whereas the Administration's policy supported the breeder&#13;
reactor, the Congress opposed to it on the environmental safety grounds; on&#13;
the other hand, the Democratic Presidential candidate (Jimmy Carter) pointed&#13;
to solar energy as the answer.&#13;
Clearly, there are many respects in which energy substitute technologies&#13;
may differ from one another; among these are the degree of environmental&#13;
acceptability, the extent to which the economy's existing capital stock is&#13;
to be adjusted to the use of substitute, the lead times needed for commercial&#13;
development, etc. However, in the analysis which follows we shall assume&#13;
that all these differences can be translated into cost differences. More&#13;
specifically, we shall characterise each substitute technology, which is&#13;
taken for simplicity to be of a 'backstop' type, by a constant unit variable&#13;
cost, p , and a minimum fixed cost, Z , which is interpreted broadly enough&#13;
to include fixed development costs, the capital-adjustment costs involved&#13;
in switching frcm the resource to the substitute (or alternatively, the costs&#13;
of bringing the substitute into perfect competition with the resource), and&#13;
the costs required for meeting certain environmental quality standards (in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
what follows we shall refer to Z briefly as the development and introduc-&#13;
tion cost). Furthermore, we assume that Z does not depend on the date of&#13;
introduction of the substitute.&#13;
If it is decided to introduce a substitute at time T , the present&#13;
value of its associated fixed costs will be   e rT Z which can equivalently&#13;
be written as&#13;
-rT Z       -rt&#13;
T&#13;
i.e. as the value, discounted back to time T , of a hypothetical constant&#13;
stream (rZ per unit of time) of costs to be incurred during (T,-). Accord-&#13;
ingly, the substitute's cost function in problem (VI.2) is now replaced by&#13;
C(x ()) =xCp ) +rZ&#13;
which, in turn, leads to replacement of the optimality conditions (VI.3.b)&#13;
and (VI.3.c) by, respectively&#13;
Pt = p    for all   tE(T,-)                               (VII.1)&#13;
and          V(PT)  PTX(PT) = V(p)-px(p)-rz                            (VII.2)&#13;
(with other necessary conditions remaining unaltered).&#13;
Thus, corresponding to each substitute technology characterised by (P,Z),&#13;
there will be an optimal policy indicating the price and hence the extraction&#13;
path of the resource, the date of introduction of the substitute, and the&#13;
price (and hence the rate) at which the substitute will be supplied. The&#13;
question is: Of the several substitute technologies specified by (pl Iz1),&#13;
(p2,Z2),..., (p ,Z ) which one ought to be developed and introduced? Of&#13;
course, a broad answer would be to choose that technology for which the&#13;
present value of the net social benfits from services of both the exhaustible&#13;
resource and substitute is the largest; but one is no doubt interested in&#13;
a more specific and perhaps practical criterion. To provide such a criterion,&#13;
let us note from (VII.2) that a substitute technology specified by (p,Z)&#13;
would yield, along an optimal policy, a constant flow of net benefits (from&#13;
the use of the substitute) given by&#13;

which reflects the obvious fact that the present value of the net benefits&#13;
from services of the substitute will be greater for a substitute technology&#13;
with a larger I than for one with a smaller I.&#13;
What is interesting to note is that although a substitute technology&#13;
with a larger I reduces the asset value of the exhaustible resource, it&#13;
increases the present value of the net benefits from the substitute by an&#13;
amount larger than required to compensate the loss in the value of the resource&#13;
stock, and therefore leads to a larger present value of the aggregate net&#13;
benefits from the use of the resource and substitute. More precisely, from&#13;
(VII.6) and (VII.8) we have&#13;
dW    dW    dW     1  -rT&#13;

This in fact establishes the criterion for choosing among several&#13;
substitutes; namely, when there are a number of substitute technologies&#13;
with different unit production costs, p , and different fixed development&#13;
and introduction costs, Z , one should select that technology for which the&#13;
flow of net benefits from use of the substitute, i.e. I(p,Z) EV(p)-p x()-rZ,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
is the largest. There are several aspects of this criterion that are worth&#13;
drawing attention to.&#13;
(1) A rather striking feature of this criterion is that the optimal&#13;
choice of the substitute technology is totally independent of the impact of&#13;
the substitute on the value of the stock of exhaustible resource. In other&#13;
words, the optimal rule is such that as if there were no exhaustible resource&#13;
in the economy and one were to make an independent choice of investment in&#13;
substitutes. In this sense, the optimal decision rule may be viewed as myopic.&#13;
(2) The fact that the optimal choice between various substitute technologies&#13;
is independent of their impacts on the value of the resource stock, makes our&#13;
decision rule operationally attractive, for in comparing the net flow of&#13;
benefits , I(p,Z) = V(p)-px(p) -rZ, associated with different substitutes&#13;
the only information we need in addition to costs are the market demand function&#13;
and the rate of discount.&#13;
(3) It is a direct implication of our criterion that when there are fixed&#13;
costs associated with the development and introduction of substitutes, it&#13;
is not generally true, as has been widely believed in the literature, that&#13;
the substitute with lowest marginal cost of production should be introduced&#13;
first. As our criterion indicates, of the two substitutes characterised by&#13;
(pitZi) and (p.,Z.) with  pi&lt; p;  and  Zi&gt; Z; , provided that I(p ,z)&gt; I(pi,Zi),&#13;
it is the substitute with the higher marginal cost of production which ought&#13;
to be developed and introduced. In fact, our criterion is a generalisation&#13;
of the marginalist rule to cases where there are fixed costs associated with&#13;
the development and introduction of substitutes-.&#13;
We end the analysis of this section by looking at the impact of fixed&#13;
development and introduction cost of the substitute on the path of resource&#13;
depletion and the date of introduction of the substitute.&#13;
1/  It seems worth mentioning that Weitzman (1976) has generalised the&#13;
marginalist rule of sequential development to cases where substitutes&#13;
take the form of several pools of the same exhaustible resource and&#13;
resource pools have arbitrary extraction cost structures. He assumes&#13;
that the demand for the resource is fixed over time and converts an&#13;
arbitrary cost stream to an "equivalent stationary cost" in order to&#13;
find the cheapest alternative.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
Noting from (VII.3) that  'I (p,Z )  -r&lt;o   , it is immediate from (VII.5)&#13;
and (VII. 7) that  - T &gt; 0 and  -  &gt; 0 . Accordingly, the larger the costs&#13;
az          D&#13;
required for the development and introduction of a substitute, the higher&#13;
will be the ceiling price obtainable for the exhaustible resource (which,&#13;
in turn, implies a more conservative depletion policy) and the later will&#13;
be the date at which the substitute is introduced. It should not then be&#13;
surprising to observe that some of the available substitute sources of&#13;
energy whose production costs are even lower than current prices of crude&#13;
oil have not yet been able to fully replace the demand for crude oil.&#13;
VIII. Summary and Conclusion&#13;
This paper has been concerned with the validity of some basic proposi-&#13;
tions in the economics of exhaustible resources in the presence of substitutes.&#13;
We have shown that, despite its widespread acceptance in the literature, the&#13;
proposition that a decrease (increase) in the rate of discount leads to a&#13;
slower (faster) depletion of exhaustible resources is not generally valid.&#13;
Using a simple resource-substitute model in which the technologies of resource&#13;
extraction and substitute production are explicitly formulated in the form&#13;
of cost functions, we have shown that a decrease in the rate of discount has&#13;
two distinct and countervailing effects. The first of these is the straight-&#13;
forward "conservation effect" of a lower discount rate- consumption in the&#13;
future is now more attractive. The second of these is the less straightforward&#13;
"disinvestment effect"- the lower discount rate reduces the unit costs of&#13;
extraction of the resource and production of the substitute, and hence&#13;
encourages faster rates of resource extraction. This latter effect has been&#13;
completely neglected in the literature and yet our analysis has shown that&#13;
for plausible parameter values it is in fact this effect that dominates.&#13;
Of course, to maintain the simplicity of our model,we abstracted from resource&#13;
exploration activities which no doubt play an important role in making deci-&#13;
sions on the rates of resource depletion. However, to the extent that a&#13;
lower discount rate encourages investments in exploration activities and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
hence increases the long-run resource availability, the inclusion of such&#13;
activities in the model would in fact reinforce the result of our analysis.&#13;
We also analysed the implications of economies or diseconomies of&#13;
scale in production of the substitute for the optimal resource depletion&#13;
policy. It was shown that when the substitute is produced under the&#13;
conditions of decreasing returns to scale, the conventional proposition&#13;
that the utilisation of the relatively high-cost substitute should not begin&#13;
before the exhaustion of the resource is not valid. Our analysis indicated&#13;
that under such conditions the optimal policy requires that the resource&#13;
and substitute be utilised simultaneously for some period of time. We also&#13;
noted that in general decreasing returns in production of the substitute&#13;
provide an argument for a faster depletion policy and quicker introduction&#13;
of the substitute. Furthermore, we showed that when there are increasing&#13;
returns in production of the substitute, it is no longer true (as has been&#13;
widely accepted in the literature) that the marginal production cost of the&#13;
substitute provides a ceiling for the price of the resource. It was shown&#13;
that under such conditions there will be an interval of time during which&#13;
the price of the resource exceeds the marginal cost of the substitute without&#13;
the resource being undercut by the substitute. We therefore argued that in&#13;
such cases the observation that the price of the resource has risen high&#13;
enough to cover the marginal cost of the substitute is not a sufficient&#13;
reason to introduce the substitute.&#13;
As a special case of increasing returns in production of the substitute,&#13;
we considered the case where a substitute technology has a constant unit&#13;
production cost and a fixed development and introduction cost. The latter&#13;
cost component was defined broadly to include not only costs required for&#13;
the development of the substitute, but also costs involved in adjusting the&#13;
modes of production and consumption to the use of the substitute, and environ-&#13;
mental costs. The question asked was: Given the availability of several&#13;
such substitute technologies, how should the society make a decision as to&#13;
which technology to choose as the substitute in the future? We noted that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
in such cases the conventional marginalist rule that 'the substitute with&#13;
lowest marginal cost should be introduced first' does not in general give&#13;
the correct answer. It was shown that the optimal decision rule is to&#13;
choose that technology for which the flow of per period net social benefits&#13;
from use of the substitute is the largest. An interesting implication of&#13;
this criterion is that the choice among substitutes should be made independ-&#13;
ently of their impacts on the value of the stock of exhaustible resource.&#13;
This suggests that in our model the uncertainty about the size of the stock&#13;
of resource is irrelevant to the choice of substitute- although it would be&#13;
interesting to allow explicitly for such uncertainties in the model and&#13;
confirm this suggestion formally.&#13;
We also noted that the existence of fixed development and introduction&#13;
costs of the substitute leads to higher prices obtainable for the resource&#13;
(and hence to a more conservative resource depletion policy) and to a later&#13;
introduction of the substitute. Given this result, it would be interesting&#13;
to see how Nordhaus' (1973) calculation of a low efficient supply price for&#13;
crude oil would be modified if one allowed for the fixed development and&#13;
introduction costs of alternative sources of energy.&#13;
In the light of the results mentioned above, it seems right to conclude&#13;
that the optimal decisions concerning the intertemporal allocation (pricing)&#13;
of an exhaustible resource depends critically on the specific economic&#13;
characteristics of substitutes available for it.&#13;

Substituting for    X   from (A.1.2) and noting that     x(p) = x (P t)pt     we&#13;
can rewrite (A.l.l.d) as&#13;

A.2 Derivation of the Necessary Conditions for Optimality&#13;
To derive the necessary conditions for the optimal solution, we form&#13;
the Lagrangean associated with problem (VI.2) and solve&#13;

and          I(pt)    V(p ) - C(x(pt))&#13;
Rewrite   L   as&#13;

Now define    eT (t)  as  e (t) E   {+l    tE[O,T)                            (A.2.3)&#13;
T        ~T         0    t, tET,c-)(A23&#13;
Using (A.2.3), we can write (A.2.2) as&#13;
L    f  e     [O(p ,t) - t(p()]9 (t)dt +        -t e   (P)dt =     dt&#13;
where   Q       t = e   (,(Pt,t) - I(pt)]QT(t) + f(p )}                       (A.2.4)&#13;
t  T       ~~t&#13;
Applying the Euler-Lagrange equation and noting that                 = 0  , we require&#13;
for a maximum that         = 0  for any given    T .at&#13;
Therefore&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

From (A.2.5) and (A.2.3) it follows that&#13;
V (pt )-(c +  re )x (pt) = 0    ,   te[0,T)                         (A.2.6)&#13;
V' (p    x' (p )C' (x(p)) = 0   ,   tE(T,-)                         (A.2.6')&#13;
t        t       t&#13;
Using (II.3) and the fact that    x (Pt) &lt; 0 , we can write (A.2.6) as&#13;
p   - c = Xert         te[O,T)                                      (A.2.7)&#13;
and   Pt    C'(X(Pt))   ,    te(T,-)                                      (A.2.7')&#13;
(A.2.7) and (A.2.7') characterise the optimal price trajectory for any given&#13;
T . To find the optimal     T , we substitute from (A.2.7) and (A.2.7 ) into&#13;
(A.2.1) to write&#13;
L =r    ert [V(p t) -p tx(p t)]dt + /= ert [V(p    - C(x)(pt))dt       (A.2.8)&#13;
Differentiating (A.2.8) w.r.t.    T  and setting   d= 0 , gives&#13;
V(pt) -pTx(pT) = V(p) -C(x(p))                                     (A.2.9)&#13;
where PT is the limit of Pt as t -T in (A.2.7), and p is the solution&#13;
to equation (A.2.7 ).&#13;

            The effect of discount rate and substitute
            technology on depletion of exhaustible resources
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper analyses the validity of
            several well established propositions in the theory of
            exhaustible resources in the presence of substitutes. By
            carefully modelling the technologies of resource extraction
            and substitute production, we show that: (A) Despite its
            widespread acceptance in the literature, the basic
            proposition that a reduction (an increase) in the rate of
            discount leads to greater conservation (faster depletion) of
            an exhaustible resource is not generally valid. It is shown
            that the effect of a change in the discount rate on the rate
            of resource depletion depends on capital requirements for
            development and production of the substitute, capital
            requirements in resource extraction and the size of the
            resource stock. (B) When there are decreasing returns in
            production of the substitute, the conventional propositon
            that a relatively high-cost substitute should not be
            utilized before the stock of the resource is exhausted is
            invalid. It is shown that in such cases the optimality
            requires that both the resource and substitute be produced
            simultaneously for some period of time. The paper also
            addresses substitute technology and marginal costs of the
            substitutes dispelling conventionally held propositions
            concerning their relationships.
