STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A. ECONOMIC AND SECTORAL BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1           As of 1992, the enterprise sector was responsible for operating 40 percent of the urban&#13;
housing stock in Russia, with a slightly smaller proportion operated by city governments and about 20&#13;
percent operated by private owners and cooperatives. Most families live in multi-story apartment&#13;
buildings. A key feature of the Soviet era was very low rents and utility charges resulting in low cost&#13;
recovery in the housing sector, which fell even further during the inflation of the early 1990s. Following&#13;
the initiation of reforms, enterprises were expected to become self-financing entities while at the same&#13;
time shouldering the financial and administrative burdens of their housing stock. Most enterprises&#13;
operated special housing maintenance (and sometimes utility) units to service their housing. During the&#13;
mass privatization program of 1992-94, ownership of the enterprise housing stock was assigned to&#13;
municipal governments as enterprises themselves were privatized.' Despite the transfer of ownership,&#13;
many enterprises remain responsible for financing and managing their former housing stock pending&#13;
divestiture of these responsibilities to local authorities. (Families have the option of privatizing their&#13;
individual units at a nominal fee, but unit privatization does not change the role of the enterprise in&#13;
financing and managing the apartment building or in providing maintenance and utilities.) Although a&#13;
presidential decree stipulates that local authorities must take over the enterprise housing stock, the process&#13;
itself must be negotiated between individual enterprises and cities, leading to considerable delays and&#13;
regional variation in the divestiture process.&#13;
1.2           As privatized enterprises begin to adapt to the demands of a market economy, they must&#13;
be able to shed their financial and managerial responsibility for housing so that they can focus on their&#13;
core business activities. Enterprises also have little incentive to spend money and other resources on their&#13;
housing stock since they do not own it, nor do their employees occupy on average more than half (and&#13;
sometimes 20 percent or less) of the apartments. This lack of incentive is reflected in the deteriorating&#13;
condition of the housing stock due to deferred maintenance and lack of capital repair. Although in the&#13;
short term, divestiture will yield only modest net financial gains to the enterprise sector as a whole&#13;
(because of an offsetting loss of tax credits and deductions), enterprises with large housing stocks will&#13;
benefit substantially. In addition, as housing costs rise over the medium term due to reforms in utility&#13;
pricing,2 and as enterprise taxation is rationalized, the costs of continuing to provide housing will be a&#13;
heavy financial burden for all enterprises unless divestiture proceeds expeditiously. Divestiture will also&#13;
yield important gains on the management side. Enterprises often have up to ten percent of their labor&#13;
force (sometimes hundreds of employees) involved in maintaining their housing stock, and according to&#13;
1/     Many non-privatized enterprises are also attempting to divest their housing, although local governments are not required&#13;
by law to accept it.&#13;
2/     Utility costs constitute over two-thirds of housing costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                             Staff Appraisal Report: Russia Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project&#13;
a recent survey, senior managers devote up to a fifth of their time to housing matters, including&#13;
responding to tenants' complaints and negotiating a maze of political, financial, fiscal and legal issues in&#13;
search of adequate resources for maintaining the housing stock.&#13;
1.3            Local governments are reluctant to take over the enterprise housing stock. Cities already&#13;
spend an average of one-quarter of their budgets on maintaining the municipal housing stock, and they&#13;
fear this would go higher. Because of current enterprise taxation rules, the net financial cost of&#13;
divestiture to city budgets for operating costs will be relatively modest in the short term (an average of&#13;
3-5 percent of current expenditures3), but with reforms to energy pricing and taxation over the medium&#13;
term, the financial burden for cities could grow  substantially.   As with enterprises, the housing&#13;
management burden will also prove extremely difficult for cities to shoulder. Municipal housing&#13;
maintenance units are in general poorly managed and fail to make efficient use of even the limited&#13;
resources available for maintaining the municipal housing stock, and local authorities are reluctant to&#13;
further overburden a poorly functioning system.4 In addition, much of the housing stock-both municipal&#13;
and enterprise-is in need of serious capital repair, and local authorities fear that responsibility for this&#13;
repair may fall on them in the absence of a private market for financing housing rehabilitation.&#13;
B. GOVERNmENT'S REFORM STRATEGY&#13;
1.4            Divestiture is a second-generation issue for the enterprise and housing reform programs&#13;
in Russia. At the beginning of the transition, the Government focused largely on clarification of&#13;
ownership rights in both areas. In the enterprise sector, this was done through the mass privatization&#13;
program, which transferred 80,000 medium and large firms to private hands. The emphasis has now&#13;
shifted to promoting post-privatization restructuring, by ensuring appropriate corporate governance and&#13;
financial discipline, developing the banking and securities markets, and upgrading managerial and&#13;
financial skills. For firms that operate many social assets, divestiture is considered critical to becoming&#13;
competitive in a world market economy. Russian firms increasingly are looking to alliances with foreign&#13;
firms as part of the restructuring process, but foreign firms are reluctant to invest in Russian enterprises&#13;
with substantial financial and/or managerial liabilities for providing housing and social services.&#13;
1.5            In the housing sector, the Government's initial focus was on unit privatization, with&#13;
tenants obtaining title to about a third of the housing stock previously owned by the government or&#13;
enterprises.5   Privatization remains a priority, but the Government recognizes that the privatization&#13;
process cannot be simply mandated but must instead be accompanied by broader reforms and institutional&#13;
change. Full privatization is impeded by the extremely poor shape of the housing stock and by the long&#13;
process required to develop joint tenant management of large buildings though condominium associations.&#13;
Deeper sectoral reforms are also required since the housing sector is a major macroeconomic issue&#13;
affecting labor mobility, employment generation, capital formation, and financial and fiscal stability. The&#13;
federal Government has now put in place a comprehensive framework of reform, but implementing the&#13;
3/     However, the burden will be much higher in some situations, especially in single-enterprise towns where the enterprises&#13;
operates virtually all of the housing stock.&#13;
4/      More detailed background on housing divestiture can be found in the Initial Executive Project Summary (IEPS) and&#13;
Concept Paper.&#13;
S/      Note that when combined with the 20 percent of housing in private hands before 1992, this means that about half of&#13;
the housing stock in Russia is now privately owned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 1. Introduction                                                                          3&#13;
necessary measures is a local government responsibility. Among the key initiatives required at the local&#13;
level are: increased cost recovery, combined with targeted assistance for vulnerable households; further&#13;
unit privatization and clarification of property rights (including of condominium associations); developing&#13;
competitive housing maintenance markets; and decreasing energy consumption of the housing stock.&#13;
1.6           With respect to housing divestiture,6 the Government has attempted to mandate this&#13;
process-without much success-since the 1950s. In many cases in the past, local authorities accepted&#13;
responsibility for enterprise housing only to find that they could not manage it and therefore had to return&#13;
it to enterprise management. Most recently, Presidential Decree number 235 (1994) reiterated that&#13;
housing previously assigned to enterprises must be divested to local authorities upon privatization of the&#13;
enterprise. At the end of 1993, the Ministry of Finance agreed to take the costs of accepting divested&#13;
social assets into account when determining federal-regional transfers, but an accurate method of&#13;
calculating such costs was never determined, and fiscal pressures prevented the federal Government from&#13;
meeting the requests submitted by local authorities.7 Local governments have thus generally impeded the&#13;
divestiture process, often demanding that the enterprise housing be completely upgraded, at tremendous&#13;
cost, prior to divestiture. Consequently, some 20 percent of the nation's housing stock continues to be&#13;
financed, maintained, and operated by enterprises.&#13;
1.7            The Government is now realizing that decrees mandating divestiture, with or without&#13;
temporary fiscal compensation to local governments, will not result in a successful or sustainable&#13;
divestiture of the housing stock. Divestiture will not be feasible unless it is accompanied by fundamental&#13;
reforms in the way the divested housing is managed and financed. In particular, this means shifting&#13;
responsibility for ownership, management, and financing to the private sector and breaking the mentality&#13;
that housing is a public good to be provided almost free of charge. This shift cannot occur overnight,&#13;
and the public sector will retain an important role during the transition, but it is vital not only to the&#13;
divestiture process but also to improving the quality of housing in Russia over the longer term. As&#13;
energy prices are liberalized, the affordability of housing services will also depend on the adoption of&#13;
widespread but relatively low-cost measures to decrease the energy consumption of the housing stock.&#13;
The strategy of the federal Government is to work with progressive city authorities to support the policy&#13;
and institutional changes, as well as investrnents, required at the local level. Divestiture of housing from&#13;
enterprises to local governments is thus only a transitional step toward the eventual goal of a private&#13;
housing sector.&#13;
C. BANK'S AsSISANcE STRATEGY&#13;
1.8            The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the Board on June 6, 1995; a&#13;
CAS Progress Report was discussed with the Board on March 28, 1996. Since the last CAS, the Bank&#13;
has continued to operate under an Intermnediate Case scenario, which remains broadly appropriate in the&#13;
current environment. This scenario assumes that there will be continued progress in macroeconomic&#13;
stabilization, as evidenced by the recent agreement with the IMF on an Extended Fund Facility (EFF)&#13;
program. In this situation, the Bank would aim to provide around $1.2-1.5 billion annually in investment&#13;
6/     IThe term 'divestiture' simply refers to the shedding by enterprises of responsibility for maintenance and operation.&#13;
7/     In any event, the allocation of compensation for divestiture seems largely to be driven by political rather than objective&#13;
criteria, and the funds are actually provided to oblast governments, which are not under any obligation to pass them down to&#13;
the municipal level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

4                                        Staff Appraisal Report: Russia Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project&#13;
lending, including a "core" program of relatively straightforward projects in infrastructure and the social&#13;
sectors. In addition, the Bank would be willing to provide up to $1.5 billion annually in relatively fast-&#13;
disbursing assistance if substantial progress was achieved on key structural reforms in specific areas of&#13;
the economy, such as agriculture and the social sectors, that are critical to the long-term sustainability&#13;
of the stabilization process. Over the past year, the Bank has been working with the Government, both&#13;
within the framework of the EFF negotiations and in separate discussions, to develop a consensus on&#13;
specific programs of structural reforms that would allow these latter operations to move forward. In the&#13;
meantime, the Bank has continued to prepare 6-7 priority investment projects as the basis for a sustained&#13;
program of Bank support for the Russian economy over the medium term.&#13;
1.9           The proposed Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project is fully consistent with the CAS&#13;
described above and has been developed in close collaboration with the Government. In particular, the&#13;
operation will contribute directly to meeting the Bank's key objective of supporting the development of&#13;
a market-oriented economy based on private-sector initiatives. It will do this by helping to demonstrate&#13;
the viability of the Government's strategy to help enterprises divest their social assets, which will in turn&#13;
facilitate enterprise restructuring. The Project will also contribute to a number of other CAS objectives,&#13;
by helping to push the ownership, financing, and management of the housing stock increasingly into&#13;
private hands. At the same time, the Project will support the implementation of a housing allowance&#13;
system to protect vulnerable households as housing costs rise. The policy framework agreed with the&#13;
Government under this Project will help maintain social services and infrastructure while improving the&#13;
efficiency of local budget expenditures. Finally, the Project will support the CAS objective of improving&#13;
energy efficiency, especially in district heating.&#13;
D. LESSONS FROM EXPERiENCE&#13;
1.10          Lessons can be gleaned from experience in Russia as well as experience with related&#13;
projects in other countries.  Lessons identified early in the Bank's work with Russian include the&#13;
importance of identifying and coordinating counterparts; defining appropriate responsibilities for different&#13;
levels of government; avoiding complexity in design; and including local consultants and institutes in&#13;
project work. The Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) held in Moscow in February 1996&#13;
concluded that a number of areas needed special emphasis to ensure satisfactory project implementation.&#13;
Onlending arrangements need to be discussed early in the project cycle and formally reviewed during&#13;
appraisal on the basis of detailed cash flow analysis. Project preparation units need to be established as&#13;
soon as the Government and Bank have agreed to include a project in the lending program. Budgeting&#13;
for taxes by non-revenue-earning entities is needed, to avoid delays in payments to contractors and&#13;
suppliers. Procurement monitoring and documentation systems need to be implemented early, and special&#13;
attention needs to be given to facilitating participation by local firms. Solid accounting and auditing&#13;
capacity is also critical.&#13;
1.11         The main lessons from reviews of Bank housing projects world-wide are that more&#13;
emphasis should be placed on policy and institutional reforms, and that the direct role of the government&#13;
in housing production should be limited. Experience with housing projects in other economies in&#13;
transition indicates the necessity to avoid overly optimistic implementation schedules, the importance of&#13;
building strong local project units to mobilize new reform constituencies, and the need of the Bank to take&#13;
a strong role in project preparation in countries unaccustomed to market mechanisms and Bank&#13;
procedures. A project involving housing divestiture in China shows that in the overall approach,&#13;
divestiture must be crafted taking into careful account the pace of supporting reforms in other sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 1. introducdon                                                                       5&#13;
Projects involving energy-saving building retrofits in Poland, East Germany, and Estonia have shown the&#13;
importance of careful design to ensure that building-level savings are translated into financial savings at&#13;
the city level.&#13;
1.12          The project team has incorporated these lessons in a number of ways. The project's&#13;
design has evolved from intensive interaction with government officials from the Ministries of Economy&#13;
and Construction, and with the Government's Working Group on Social Asset Divestiture. In addition,&#13;
the team has consulted closely with the Ministry of Finance and GKI. The number of project components&#13;
has been strictly limited to make implementation and supervision less problematic. Project preparation&#13;
is relying heavily on local expertise, both individual consultants and NGOs such as the Russian Center&#13;
for Energy Efficiency. With respect to the lessons learned from the CPPR process, extensive cash flow&#13;
analysis was undertaken in connection with discussions with the Ministry of Finance and participating&#13;
cities concerning the onlending agreements, and these agreements should be ready for signature shortly&#13;
following Board presentation. Oblast authorities have also indicated their willingness to guarantee the&#13;
sub-loans. An informal project preparation unit, financed through bilateral grants and a PPF, has been&#13;
in place for over a year, and over half of the staff is already now in place and has received training in&#13;
their respective areas of responsibility, including procurement, disbursement, and accounting. The&#13;
remainder of the staff will be hired at loan effectiveness. The preparation team has calculated the&#13;
required budgetary allocations by the participating cities for taxes and duties, and the cities have agreed&#13;
to allocate the required amounts. A wide range of implementation issues have been discussed with&#13;
officials of the participating cities in a series of seminars (including during negotiations) and site visits&#13;
held over the past several months. Procurement issues were explored in detail at two trade association&#13;
meetings held in Moscow, and additional seminars have been held to assist local suppliers to understand&#13;
Bank procurement procedures.&#13;
1.13          With respect to lessons learned from other housing and energy efficiency projects world&#13;
wide, the project has been carefully designed to accelerate the policy and institutional reforms required&#13;
to move direct provision of housing services away from the public sector and into the private sector.&#13;
Tenant surveys and meetings have been held to ensure that residents' concerns are properly addressed,&#13;
and extensive stakeholder analysis was undertaken to understand the incentives and interests of various&#13;
other agents, such as utilities and city housing departments. The project design includes publicity and&#13;
outreach efforts designed to mobilize the support of various stakeholders for project reforms and&#13;
investments. Much attention has been paid to analyzing the pace of supporting reforms, especially in the&#13;
areas of property rights, taxation, and energy policy and utility regulation. PPF and grant funding from&#13;
bilateral sources has been used for extensive design work to ensure that energy efficiency retrofits to be&#13;
supported are evaluated in the context of the overall district heating and other utility systems.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
II. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.1          The primary objective of the project is to accelerate and make sustainable the divestiture&#13;
of enterprise housing. This will help enterprises focus their limited financial and managerial resources&#13;
on restructuring core business activities to meet the challenges of an open-market economy. To ensure&#13;
that divestiture is feasible for cities in the short term and sustainable over time, the project will support&#13;
reforms that push the ownership, financing, and management of the housing stock into the private sector,&#13;
which is an integral aspect of the economic transition occurring in Russia. Secondary objectives of the&#13;
project include a wider range of reforms as follows:&#13;
*     Housing privatization, including condominium creation-so that enterprise housing divestiture&#13;
does not lead to massive increases in the volume of public housing&#13;
*     Cost recovery of housing maintenance and utility fees from tenants-to make the process of&#13;
divestiture more affordable for cities and rationalize the flow of funds in the housing sector&#13;
*      Targeted housing allowances-to protect vulnerable groups in the context of increased cost&#13;
recovery&#13;
*     Competitive bidding maintenance of housing-to rationalize and increase private sector&#13;
participation in the provision of services in the housing sector&#13;
*     Improved energy efficiency in divested housing-to reduce the costs of maintaining housing, and&#13;
make the divestiture process affordable for both cities and households&#13;
2.2           All of these policy objectives under the Project are essential to accelerate the divestiture&#13;
process and make it sustainable; in addition, these objectives can be measured, in some cases&#13;
quantitatively. The indicators by which the achievement of both policy and project objectives will be&#13;
measured are detailed in Chapter IV. Some of these objectives have already been met in the course of&#13;
project preparation (Box 2-1).&#13;
2.3           Finally, the project is conceived as a demonstration project. An explicit objective of the&#13;
project is to demonstrate that a mix of policy measures and investments can accelerate and make&#13;
sustainable the process of divesting housing from enterprises. The demonstration effect of this project&#13;
will be achieved if: (a) divestiture in the project cities is completed rapidly; (b) the rate of other policy&#13;
reforms in the project cities outpaces the rate of reforms nationwide; and (c) housing affordability in&#13;
project cities is increased.&#13;

III. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
A. PROJECT CONCEPT SUMMARY&#13;
3.1          Although the issue of housing divestiture is complex, the project concept is&#13;
straightforward. In return for implementing a range of policy and institutional reforms needed to make&#13;
housing divestiture feasible in the short run and sustainable over the longer run, EHDP will finance&#13;
investments that will both reduce operating costs and increase comfort levels in the housing stock.&#13;
During project implementation, as each city implements competitive contracting for maintenance and&#13;
other reforms, buildings will become eligible for investments. Although condominiums and divested&#13;
enterprise housing will have priority, municipal apartment buildings will also be eligible for investments&#13;
if they are placed under a competitive management regime and meet other conditions consistent with an&#13;
increased private sector role. The Ministry of Finance will onlend Bank funds to participating cities to&#13;
cover the costs of most TA as well as the energy efficiency retrofits. Cities will repay the loans by a&#13;
combination of generalized increases in cost recovery and depreciation charges for those households that&#13;
benefit from the retrofits. The project includes a strong package of TA to support the implementation&#13;
of the required policy and institutional changes, and to design and carry out the investments.&#13;
B. LINK BETWEEN DrVEsTffuRE, POLICY REFORMS, AND INVESTMENTS&#13;
Competitive City Selection&#13;
3.2          Thirteen cities were initially chosen by the Government and Bank in late 1994 to compete&#13;
for access to the proposed energy efficiency investments. The criteria for final city selection addressed&#13;
four basic issues: (a) ability of the city administrations to conclude divestiture arrangements with&#13;
enterprises; (b) increases in cost recovery; (c) pace of housing privatization and the adoption of an&#13;
enabling framework for condominium formation; and (d) establishment of a competitive market for&#13;
housing maintenance. During June and July 1995, the project team evaluated the progress made by the&#13;
cities and tentatively selected six cities (Novocherkassk, Orenburg, Petrozavodsk, Ryazan, Vladimir, and&#13;
Volkhov) for final inclusion in the project. At appraisal, this list was confirmed based on a final&#13;
evaluation of progress with implementing reforms. A seventh city, Cherepovets, was included as a&#13;
"reserve" city. It may become eligible for investments under the project at a future date if: (a) it meets&#13;
all the policy criteria in effect at that date; and (b) another city drops out of the project. Although not&#13;
anticipated at this stage, flexibility will be retained so that other cities may become eligible for similar&#13;
reserve status during the life of the project (see Annex P).&#13;
Annual and Mid-Term Reviews&#13;
3.3          The project will continue to link progress on divestiture and housing sector reforms to&#13;
the investments via a system of annual reviews. In addition to channeling bilateral TA for policy&#13;
implementation to the cities, the Central Project Implementation Unit will annually review city&#13;
performance in each of these areas against pre-defined annual policy and institutional reform targets (see&#13;
Annex T). Both the annual review process and the building eligibility criteria (see paragraph 3.17) will&#13;
maintain the link between investments and policy reform. In Year 3 of the project, a mnid-term review&#13;
will be held in lieu of an annual policy review; in addition to reviewing progress on policy reform, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

mid-term review will address issues of implementation capacity, rates of disbursement, decentralization&#13;
of management, and possible reallocations of funds among cities (see Chapter 4 for more details on the&#13;
mid-term review).&#13;
C. PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
3.4           The project has four components: (a) housing divestiture from enterprises, associated&#13;
general housing reforms, and housing allowances for vulnerable households; (b) building retrofits,&#13;
including metering, energy efficiency investments, and limited capital repair; (c) upstream investments&#13;
in the divested utility networks. These first three components will be implemented by a combination of&#13;
TA and investments in metering and energy efficiency retrofits (see Figure 3-1). The fourth component&#13;
(d) is project management. Substantial progress on divestiture and housing reforms has been made as a&#13;
result of the competitive process for city selection (see Annex P). Based on their performance to date,&#13;
all participating cities will be eligible for Phase I investments (metering-see below). Further progress&#13;
on divestiture and housing reforms will be required each year as a pre-condition for remaining eligible&#13;
for additional project investments (see Annex T).&#13;

3.5           As discussed above, reaching formal agreements covering divestiture of 80 percent of the&#13;
eligible housing stock was a condition of city selection. In most cases, cities have shown they can&#13;
implement these agreements by themselves, but the project will provide TA to cities as necessary on&#13;
technical, institutional, and financial issues. The actual pace of divestiture in each city will influence the&#13;
funding available for the energy efficiency retrofits.&#13;
3.6           The Project will also support the implementation of policy reforms at the city level in the&#13;
following areas: (a) cost recovery; (b) implementation of housing allowances to protect vulnerable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 3. Project Description                                                              11&#13;
households; (c) formation of condominium associations, including the legal and regulatory framework;&#13;
and (d) competitive bidding for housing maintenance. TA will be provided under the project to support&#13;
cities' implementation of reforms in all of the areas, although cities themselves will be required to finance&#13;
the system of housing allowances, including both direct benefits and administration costs. The Project&#13;
will also provide TA to commercial banks expressing an interest in lending to condominium associations&#13;
for capital repairs and general rehabilitation not financed by the Project under the energy efficiency&#13;
component.&#13;
3.7           The cities will be responsible for establishing the institutional mechanism and screening&#13;
capacity to implement a housing allowance scheme in accordance with the Government Resolution No.&#13;
935 of September 22, 1993 (See Annex H). This institutional setting should have sufficient capacity to&#13;
accommodate all eligible applicants and will be adequately publicized (See Annex T for more details).&#13;
The project supervision plan (Chapter 4) specifies that the progress in this area will be closely monitored&#13;
by the CPIU through periodic on-site easements.&#13;
Building Retrofits&#13;
3.8           There will be two phases of loan-financed investments, plus limited capital repair of the&#13;
divested housing stock by local governments and tenants.&#13;
3.9           Phase I: Metering. In phase I, which will begin in Year 1 and continue at least through&#13;
Year 3, the project will finance metering in the participating cities, concentrating on the buildings to be&#13;
retrofitted under Phase II. Since the design and tendering process for meters is much simpler than for&#13;
the retrofits, it should be possible to begin implementing this phase in Year I in all participating cities.&#13;
Whether this is possible, however, will depend largely on the ability of the cities to provide information&#13;
and logistical cooperation, and thus not all cities may actually receive investments the first year.&#13;
Metering may continue in later years of the project if appropriate.&#13;
3.10          The emphasis will be on metering heat production, distribution, and consumption points&#13;
(buildings or building sections), since heat represents by far the highest energy cost in the cities.&#13;
Metering will: (i) give baseline information to evaluate the cost savings of the retrofits; (ii) provide the&#13;
data needed to implement a system of billing by consumption; and (iii) provide the information on&#13;
production and distribution efficiency necessary to better regulate local heat companies and other utilities.&#13;
3.11          Phase ll: Building Retrofits.  Tender design will start in early 1996, but general&#13;
contractors will not be selected until October or later. This approach will allow contractors to audit the&#13;
buildings and order equipment over the 1996-97 heating season and begin physical work in Spring 1997.&#13;
A general contractor approach will be taken. Experience to date in Russia and elsewhere in the former&#13;
Soviet Union (FSU)/Eastern Europe indicates that foreign general contractors will be highly competitive&#13;
in the initial stages due to their management expertise and familiarity with the technologies involved.&#13;
However, much of the work will be done by Russian firms through sub-contracts, and much of the&#13;
equipment is likely to come from local suppliers. Over time, it is likely that qualified Russian general&#13;
contractors will emerge, but it is important not to select general contractors that do not have the&#13;
management capacity or financial resources to fulfill the contract terms since this has driven several&#13;
technically qualified Russian firms into bankruptcy under some other projects in Russia.&#13;
3.12          An estimated 350,000 apartments in 3,500 buildings across the six participating cities will&#13;
be retrofitted with various efficiency measures. Since over two-thirds of the operating cost of the housing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                          Staff Appraisal Report: Russia Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project&#13;
stock is accounted for by utility costs, it is expected that most investments will be designed to reduce&#13;
energy consumption, especially from district heat and hot water (which together account for 80-85 percent&#13;
of total residential energy use). One of the earliest preparation activities was a comprehensive energy&#13;
use measurement exercise in one of the candidate cities. Further intensive technical preparation work has&#13;
now been completed, and a number of technical, institutional, and procurement issues are being addressed&#13;
under PPF-financed experimental design phase retrofits in four buildings in Ryazan. Results of the design&#13;
work will allow project implementation to begin rapidly once the project is effective.&#13;
3.13           Based on maximum payback period of five years, it is estimated that investments per&#13;
apartment will be in the range of US$600-US$1,000. A model for developing investment packages for&#13;
each building based on climate, building characteristics, fuel prices, and other factors has been developed.&#13;
Based on this, a list of forty different candidate measures has been compiled and includes, e.g., insulation&#13;
in the ceiling and basement and around pipes; caulking around doors and windows; building-level and&#13;
heat-point controls and heat meters; thermostatic controls and possibly gas meters at the apartment level;&#13;
lighting retrofits; and water conservation measures (see Annex E). The exact design of the retrofit&#13;
packages will change over the life of the project as experience is gained and new technologies are&#13;
identified. Experimental design work is already underway in one project city (see Box 3-1).&#13;
Box 3-1. Experimental Design Work in Ryazan&#13;
PPF-financed experimental design work is being conducted in Ryazn to develop experience upon which to&#13;
design the specifics of Phase II project implementation. The goals of the demonstration are: (1) to test and&#13;
demonstrate the effectiveness of individual energy and water efficiency retrofit technologies in Soviet-style&#13;
buildings, (2) to pilot contracting, metering, and retrofit installation approaches, and (3) to develop strategies&#13;
to maximize public acceptance of the retrofit technologies and implementation approaches.&#13;
Six buildings (a set of three identical 9-story buildings, and a set of three identical 5-story buildings) are being&#13;
extensively metered for energy and water consumption. Two general contractors were selected for this work&#13;
through an international tender. One building of each set is being retrofit with the best suite of energy-&#13;
efficiency and water-efficiency retrofits that meets a 5-year payback investment criterion. A second building&#13;
in each set is being used to test alternative retrofits to determiine which proves most cost-effective. (In the&#13;
9-story buildings, alternative ventilation control strategies are being examined; in the 5-story buildings, an&#13;
alternative heating control system is being examined.) The final building of each suite will serve as a control&#13;
building.&#13;
The project is phased so that pre-retrofit information will be collected in all six buildings during the Winter&#13;
of 1995-96, thus providing a baseline against which to measure the impact of energy-efficiency and water-&#13;
efficiency retrofits. The buildings will be retrofit during the late Winter and Spring of 1996. At the least,&#13;
metering will continue through the 1996-97 heating season to measure retrofit results.&#13;
As part of the work, detailed social surveys of building occupants are being undertaken, before, during, and&#13;
after the retrofit activity, as a way of understanding what retrofits are acceptable, and to help design tenant&#13;
interaction approaches in the later EHDP implementation effort.&#13;
3.14           To make possible and/or enhance the gains from the energy efficiency measures, the cities&#13;
and tenants will undertake capital repair of the divested housing stock. This will include repair of roofs,&#13;
doors, walls, windows, etc. In cases where direct financial savings can be attributed to such&#13;
improvements, they will be financed as part of the energy efficiency measures in Phase II.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 3. Project Description                                                                13&#13;
Upstream Rehabilitation&#13;
3.15          As housing is divested, cities will be making substantial investments for urgent repairs&#13;
and rehabilitation of the associated engineering networks. Many cost-effective investment opportunities&#13;
exist in the district heating distribution networks themselves. Potential investments include upgraded or&#13;
replaced pipe insulation, equipment for automatic control and regulation, renovation of pumps and motors&#13;
with variable-speed drives, and measures for better pipe corrosion protection. The costs for these repairs&#13;
and investments will come from city budgets, with some cities getting additional in-kind or cash&#13;
contributions from enterprises and households and/or possibly future donor assistance. Though Bank&#13;
financing under the Project will be primarily for building-level investments, limited Bank financing will&#13;
be provided for investments slightly further up the distribution chain (e.g., substation) when they are (a)&#13;
relatively simple; and (b) have high returns or are needed to ensure the building-level measures translate&#13;
into real energy and financial savings. The measures financed will, to the greatest extent possible, be&#13;
robust with respect to future decisions about the overall design of the district heating system-e.g.,&#13;
whether cities continue to use district heat or switch to boilers at the building or neighborhood level.&#13;
Project Management&#13;
3.16          The project will be carried out through the CPIU in Moscow and Local Implementation&#13;
Groups (LIGs) in the participating cities. Responsibility for procurement and disbursement will initially&#13;
be concentrated in the CPIU for logistical and other reasons, but may be devolved to the LIGs over time&#13;
depending on the experience to date. For more details on project management and implementation, see&#13;
Chapter 4.&#13;
D. BUILDING SELECTION&#13;
3.17          For technical and logistical reasons, the actual buildings to be selected cannot be fully&#13;
specified in advance. However, the following principles will apply: (i) regardless of other characteristics,&#13;
condominiums will always receive the highest priority for retrofits; (ii) with respect to the rest of the&#13;
housing stock, Phase I and Phase II investments will be concentrated in the largest buildings in each city&#13;
because of the significantly higher economic and financial returns to retrofitting these buildings; (iii)&#13;
priority for the building-level retrofits within the largest buildings would then be accorded to buildings&#13;
that are divested and under competitive maintenance regimes. Though these criteria may mean that some&#13;
municipal housing gets retrofitted, in no case will buildings that are still maintained by enterprises be&#13;
eligible for Phase II investments until they are divested.&#13;

E. ONLENDING AND REPAYMENT OF BANK FUNDS&#13;
3.18            The flow of Bank loan funds is shown in Figure 3-2. For metering and retrofits, along&#13;
with associated costs of engineering and procurement services, Bank funds will be onlent through the&#13;
Ministry of Finance to the cities, which will sign contracts for the work. Bank funds will be onlent at&#13;
no more than 2.5 percent over the rate charged by the Bank to the Ministry of Finance. The cities will&#13;
have a grace period of 6 years, with final maturity of fourteen years and will bear all commitment fees&#13;
and foreign exchange risk. Although not directly involved in implementation, the relevant oblast&#13;
authorities will guarantee repayment of the sub-loans and agree to support project implementation.&#13;
3.19             Figure 3-3 shows how the sub-loans to cities will be repaid. The metering and retrofits&#13;
are designed to generate enough financial savings (in utility costs) to repay the Bank loan. The cities will&#13;
collect depreciation charges on the retrofits using the "passbook" that households currently use to pay&#13;
housing maintenance and utility charges each month. The percentage of actual depreciation charged to&#13;
households will be in proportion to overall cost recovery for housing services.8 If 100 percent cost&#13;
recovery levels are achieved as mandated by the time most retrofits are installed, city revenues from the&#13;

8/      For example. if the city reaches 80 percent cost recovery levels in 1997, households would pay 80 percent of the&#13;
depreciation charge for the retrofits. Depreciation will be calculated using standard Government rules for these types of fixed&#13;
investments. However, the implementation of depreciation charges may vary by city, depending on the ability of households&#13;
in each city to afford the general increases in cost recovery for utility services.&#13;

depreciation charges will be sufficient to repay approximately 70 percent of the annual repayments on the&#13;
sub-loans9. The rest of the revenue needed by the cities for repayment will come from the reduction in&#13;
subsidy payments needed to utility companies as general cost recovery for utility services increases. The&#13;
net cash flow to cities and households from the project will be highly positive (see Chapter 5 and Annex&#13;
S.)&#13;

F. PROJECT COST&#13;
3.20          The total project cost is estimated at about US$551 million equivalent, including&#13;
contingencies amounting to US$23 million, which represents about 5 percent of base costs. Standard&#13;
Bank forecasts were used to project foreign price inflation, and estimates from the 1995 Country&#13;
Economic Memorandum for Russia (Toward Medium-Term Viability) were used to project domestic&#13;
inflation and exchange rate movements. Since the loan allocation for metering and retrofits is similar to&#13;
a line of credit, no contingencies were assumed on those investment components, though 10 percent&#13;
physical contingencies were assumed on operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs for those investments.&#13;
Given the difficulties of predicting exact requirements, ten percent physical contingencies were also&#13;
assumed for TA and project management costs. Foreign exchange costs are estimated to be US$290&#13;
million (52 percent of the total). Incremental recurrent costs (primarily O&amp;M  of the metering and&#13;
retrofits) are estimated at US$49 million. Local taxes and duties are estimated at US$69 million. Table&#13;
3-1 summarizes the total project costs for each component. Annex A provides further details.&#13;
3.21          Project costs including taxes and duties (figures rounded but excluding contingencies)&#13;
are as follows:&#13;
9/     This is because the depreciation period for the investments is longer than the maturity period of the Bank loans. On&#13;
an NPV basis, the city would recover from tenants the full costs of repaying the loan.&#13;

G. PROJECT FINANCING&#13;
3.26          The proposed Bank single-currency loan of US$300 million, provided with 15 years'&#13;
maturity and six years' grace at the applicable variable interest rate, would finance 54 percent of total&#13;
project costs including taxes or 62 percent of project costs excluding taxes (see Table 3-2). The Russian&#13;
Federation requested a single-currency loan in US Dollars, with the rationale that the energy savings&#13;
deriving from the efficiency retrofits are valued primarily in US Dollars. The proposed loan falls within&#13;
the Russian Federation's volume access for single currency loans for FY96. The loan would cover all&#13;
of the foreign exchange costs plus approximately US$11 million of local costs, which is justified by the&#13;
severe fiscal adjustment that the federal and local governments are undergoing, and the fact that the&#13;
Project will accelerate this adjustment in participating cities. Local governments (partly using greatly&#13;
increased cost recovery from households) would finance all taxes, as well as capital repair of retrofitted&#13;
buildings, all O&amp;M, upstream retrofits, housing allowances, and LIG costs (totalling US$239 million).&#13;
The federal Goverrnment would cover taxes on the CPIU as well as on the engineering and procurement&#13;
advisory services (US$8 million). (The Federal government will also assume responsibility to repay $10&#13;
million of CPIU costs financed by the Bank loan.) USAID would provide parallel grant financing of the&#13;
US$2 million Policy Implementation Support sub-component. If this funding is unexpectedly curtailed&#13;
or proves to be insufficient in the outer years of the Project, unallocated Bank funds under the loan will&#13;
be made available for this sub-component.&#13;

3.27           Financing allocation per city. The indicative loan amount per city has been determined&#13;
based on a number of parameters, including city size, fiscal situation, technical characteristics of building&#13;
stock, and implementation schedule (see Annex B). The indicative allocation, shown in Table 3-3 below,&#13;
was reviewed at appraisal and finalized at negotiations. Depending on the progress of implementation&#13;
in participating cities (including pace of divestiture, reforms and investments) as well as the evolving&#13;
fiscal situation, the allocations among cities may be revised during project implementation.&#13;

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECr ORGANIZATION&#13;
4.1          Implementation of both the investment and TA components will be shared between the&#13;
central project implementation unit (CPIU) at the federal level and local implementation groups (LIGs)&#13;
at the city level. Over time the ratio of responsibilities assigned to the CPIU and LIGs will shift, but&#13;
during the initial stages of project implementation, much of the responsibility will remain at the federal&#13;
level. What follows describes: (i) the allocation of responsibilities between the CPIU and LIGs at the&#13;
beginning of the project; (ii) the responsibilities over time that may shift to the LIGs; and (iii) the&#13;
conditions under which these responsibilities might be shifted to LIGs.&#13;
4.2           The CPIU, which is already functioning and well staffed, will be formally established as&#13;
a non-commercial foundation with Govermment and non-Government participation, with Government&#13;
entities constituting a majority of the Board. The foundation will receive guidance from a Board of&#13;
Directors, on which the Ministries of Economy, Finance, Construction, and possibly other Government&#13;
agencies will be represented. The CPIU will be invested with the authority to enter into contracts to&#13;
carry out the project on behalf of the Government.&#13;
4.3           The structure of the CPIU is outlined in Figure 4-1. At the outset, the CPIU will be&#13;
responsible for:&#13;
(i)    Policy Formulation and Oversight. Bilateral cofinancing of policy-oriented TA will&#13;
continue to support the development of competitive housing maintenance and&#13;
condominium associations. The CPIU will undertake to coordinate the dissemination of&#13;
this TA to the cities, including the organization of seminars and training sessions as&#13;
necessary. The CPIU will also monitor policy issues at the federal and local levels,&#13;
oversee participation issues, develop annual policy targets, and assess cities' performance&#13;
(para. 4.43).&#13;
(ii)    Communications. Cormnunications will be handled by staff reporting directly to the&#13;
Project Director who will be responsible for pulling together project information from&#13;
the policy issues group and the deputy directors for implementation and finance of&#13;
interest to cities (including non-participating cities), bidders, the Government and any&#13;
other interested parties. The CPIU cormmunications function will also generate press&#13;
releases and informational brochures designed to provide information for residents in the&#13;
project cities, and will work closely with the policy formulation and engineering groups&#13;
on participation issues. In addition, the CPIU will,4isseminate information about, and&#13;
experience gained under the project-to the Goyvrnment, other cities, potential other&#13;
donors and the public.&#13;
(iii)   Technology Adice. Oversight and supervision of the Technology Advisory Group&#13;
(TAG) (see para. 4.4).&#13;
(iv)   Procurement and Engineering. Oversight and supervision of the Procurement and&#13;
Engineering Group (PEG) (see para. 4.5).&#13;

(v)     Financial Operations and Disbursements.  The finance unit will be responsible for&#13;
establishing project financial operations, and project accounting procedures.&#13;
Disbursement specialists will handle the processing of all direct disbursement requests,&#13;
and disbursements and reimbursements from the Special Account (SA). They will be&#13;
responsible for responding to city requests for disbursement against local procurement&#13;
actions, and for reporting to the Bank on all disbursement and accounting matters. The&#13;
investment component as well as the costs of the technology and procurement groups of&#13;
the loan will be fully repaid by cities to the Government. A loan officer within the CPIU&#13;
will help the cities develop the required documentation and will be responsible for&#13;
intermediating between the cities and the Ministry of Finance on repayment of their sub-&#13;
loans.&#13;

4.4              The Technology Advisory Group (TAG), under contract to and reporting to the CPIU,&#13;
will be responsible for identifying cost-effective energy and water efficient technology packages for&#13;
application in the participating cities. They will work intensively with the LIGs in each city to: (a)&#13;
identify and sequence appropriate investment packages based on experience under the project and on&#13;
evaluation of new technologies as they become available; (b) working closely with the engineering&#13;
supervision and procurement group of the CPIU (see below), help cities develop retrofit materials and&#13;
installation tender packages; and (c) provide assistance as necessary to LIGs in overseeing technological&#13;
aspects of work implemented by contractors.&#13;
4.5             The Procurement and Engineering Group (PEG), under contract and reporting to the&#13;
CPIU, will handle engineering implementation, contract management, and all international procurement&#13;
of goods and services. This group will work closely with the technology advisory group to design tender&#13;
packages, coordinate pre-bid conferences, stage bid openings, and will generally oversee project&#13;
procurement to ensure it is carried out in accordance with Bank guidelines. This group will also be&#13;

responsible for assisting LIGs with local procurement of goods and services, ensuring that cities follow&#13;
Bank procedures, and assisting cities with metering and retrofit contract management.&#13;
4.6           LIGs will:&#13;
(i)    work with city housing and utility officials and the TAG to identify retrofit packages;&#13;
(ii)   be supported by the PEG in the development and evaluation (jointly with the CPIU) of&#13;
tender packages for internationally procured goods and services;&#13;
(iii)   carry out related local procurement actions;&#13;
(iv)   interact with the CPIU Disbursement Group for project accounting and audit activities,&#13;
and disbursements related to locally procured goods and services;&#13;
(v)    oversee the work of contractors with TAG and PEG assistance;&#13;
(vi)   coordinate city participation in seminars and training for competitive maintenance,&#13;
condominium formation; and&#13;
(vii)  report to CPIU on performance against policy targets and implementation of retrofit&#13;
installation and operations activities.&#13;
4.7           Responsibilities that may shift to LIGs over time include a part of the engineering design&#13;
responsibilities, international procurement, and local disbursement.  Shifts in engineering design&#13;
responsibilities are assumed to take place over time as the cities' engineering expertise in retrofit design&#13;
grows over the life of the project-no other preconditions are foreseen. Responsibility for international&#13;
procurement can only be shifted to the cities after cities undergo training in procurement issues from the&#13;
CPIU procurement group, gain experience by participating in CPIU-led tender activities, and when&#13;
international communications to the city have improved sufficiently to allow for reliable communication&#13;
with international bidders. Responsibility for local disbursement can only be transferred to LIGs when&#13;
branch accounts of the SAs for each city can be set up in a local commercial bank acceptable to the Bank,&#13;
and a local project accounting system is installed so they are capable of documenting and reporting fully&#13;
on the activity of the SAs. Reporting on SAs would be carried out through the CPIU. When such&#13;
responsibilities are decentralized, the LIGs' local procurement, contract administration and disbursement&#13;
activities will reflect Bank guidelines for Community-Related Procurement."&#13;
4.8           A project organization chart and summary terms of reference (TOR) of each group in the&#13;

B. IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS AND SCHEDULE&#13;
4.9           Both the TA and retrofit investment components will be implemented over six calendar&#13;
years, following anticipated loan effectiveness in mid-1996. Implementation of engineering design,&#13;
metering, and retrofit activities will be shaped by the direct experience with experimental design retrofits&#13;
now underway in one of the cities. It is expected that metering and retrofit interventions will approach&#13;
a "basic package" per building type as experience is gained from installations in different regions.&#13;
Implementation of the investment component will begin in mid-1996 following loan effectiveness.&#13;
Project Management&#13;
4.10            The CPIU will be responsible for overall project direction and management. The CPIU&#13;
will set up administration, procurement and disbursement systems, and support the procurement and&#13;
oversight of installation of retrofits by participating cities. Initial technology advisory assistance will be&#13;
provided to the CPIU by a consultant for a period of approximately six months (until April 1996) under&#13;
a contract financed by PPF and bilateral funding sources. This consultant is helping the CPIU conduct&#13;
an experimental design retrofit effort in Ryazan, and will outline a technology assessment system to&#13;
identify the most cost-effective intervention packages for subsequent metering and retrofit installations&#13;
beginning in the second half of CY1996. The CPIU, the TAG, and PEG will subsequently provide&#13;
technology advice, management and engineering assistance or training for the cities so they will begin&#13;
to develop the capacity to identify, package, and administer local metering, retrofit installation and&#13;
operations components.&#13;
4.11          The investment program will be implemented in two phases for each city.'2  The first&#13;
phase will cover metering only; the second phase will cover energy-saving retrofits of buildings, and a&#13;
limited amount of upstream retrofits. In each phase, separate tender documents will be prepared for&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB), and up to two contractors per city may be selected. ICB,&#13;
general contractor (GC) or single-responsibility-type contracts, signed and administered by the cities, will&#13;
be the preferred method for implementing the metering (Phase I) and retrofit installation (Phase II)&#13;
contracts. Depending upon implementation experience, however, and if warranted by supply or&#13;
standardization conditions and approved by the Bank, some meters or retrofit materials and equipment&#13;
might be centrally procured and delivered to the cities for installation. The total number of contracts&#13;
active at a time will be kept at a level that will both minimize contract management burdens for the cities&#13;
and CPIU, and create sufficient competition among potential contractors. Cities will receive assistance&#13;
from CPIU consultants to develop technical and contract management capacities. Development and&#13;
installation of procurement, project accounting and disbursement systems, and training by CPIU&#13;
consultants, will ensure that procedural controls and accountability are built into the LIGs.&#13;
Phase I&#13;
4.12          Activities under Phase I will begin upon loan effectiveness for all cities that have fulfilled&#13;
loan disbursement conditions, including signed sub-loan agreements and full staffing of the LIGs. At that&#13;
time, the CPIU and cities will tender for and select one or more general contractors per city to deliver&#13;
and install energy and service metering in buildings and facilities on a single-responsibility contracting&#13;
basis in as many cities that are ready to proceed with Phase I activities. The buildings to be retrofitted&#13;
12/    'Phase' in this context is used to define a fixed form of activity, which can occur during different calendar periods&#13;
for each city, depending upon each city's capacities and other factors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 4. Project Implementation                                                             23&#13;
will be selected according to the criteria outlined in Chapter 3, Section D, and building-level meters will&#13;
be installed in this subset of buildings. The first tenders will be bid upon in spring 1996, and the first&#13;
group of meters installed in advance of the 1996-1997 heating season. For most cities, the remaining&#13;
meters should be installed during 1997. Metering contracts will be smaller in the beginning to give the&#13;
CPIU and cities time to become familiar with the procurement and contract administration processes, and&#13;
to establish their disbursement and accounting systems. As experience is gained at the CPIU and LIG&#13;
levels, metering contracts will be expanded to volumes consistent with cities' cashflow and debt&#13;
management capacities, and conmpletion of metering in target structures over a two or three year period.&#13;
Phase II&#13;
4.13             This phase will comprise the installation of energy-saving retrofits in residential&#13;
buildings and related heating system structures. Its implementation will incorporate CPIU and LIG&#13;
experiences with procurement and contracting under Phase I (metering). Procurement documents for&#13;
initial Phase II activities will be prepared during 1996. This activity will be strongly influenced by the&#13;
experience gained under the experimental design retrofit activity currently being carried out with PPF&#13;
financing in Ryazan'. The procurement and contracting carried out for this activity has already given the&#13;
Government and its engineering consultants a good sense of the relative capacity of city administrations&#13;
as well as of general contractors and their subcontractors, and has led to the more prescriptive approach&#13;
to contracting described above. Administrative, logistical, and contractual problems resolved in the&#13;
course of this activity have also alerted the Govermnent as to how such difficulties might be avoided or&#13;
mitigated in future contracting. As city and CPIU capacity allows, some cities will proceed with Phase&#13;
II before others. For some cities, Phase II bidding may occur as early as late 1996, and initial retrofits&#13;
will occur in advance of the 1997-1998 heating season. In other cities, bidding will not occur until later&#13;
in 1997, and retrofits will be installed during or after the 1997-1998 heating season. ICB contracting is&#13;
envisioned for most of the retrofit works; the exceptions might be some small value or isolated activities&#13;
whereby the cities would use other procurement methods (paras. 4.21 and 4.22) as provided for in the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines.&#13;
4.14           Initial (Phase I) metering proposals and tender packages are expected to be completed&#13;
and issued shortly after the projected loan signing. Under this scenario, general contracts for meter&#13;
installation would be ready for implementation in the cities that fulfill disbursement conditions during the&#13;
sunmmer of 1996. The initial metering contracts are expected to cover twelve to eighteen months worth&#13;
of installations, so experience can be gained with purchasing, deliveries and installation supervision before&#13;
larger contracts are tendered. These initial contracts will allow the cities to engage general contractors&#13;
through at least one heating season and a summer to ensure that everything is working properly. Similar&#13;
approaches will be used for the Phase II retrofit contracts, which are expected to be initially tendered&#13;
toward the latter part of 1996. Retrofit contracts may initially be smaller in size because they will be&#13;
somewhat more involved regarding installation inspections and acceptance for payment. Tenders will be&#13;
structured as design-purchase-and-install contracts. The appraisal mission has determined that insufficient&#13;
baseline energy consumption data exists to allow performance-based contracting, due to the current lack&#13;
of meters and the difficulties of measuring indoor temperatures in all buildings after heat meters are&#13;
installed during Phase I. Without indoor temperature readings, it would be difficult to provide concrete&#13;
and unambiguous estimates of before-and-after performnance of retrofits because of variables like heating&#13;
supply temperatures, tenant behavior, and climate.&#13;
&#13;

24                                      Staff Appraisal Report: Russia Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project&#13;
4.15          For both the metering and retrofits, along with associated costs of engineering and&#13;
procurement services, Bank funds will be onlent through the Ministry of Finance to the cities, which will&#13;
sign contracts with general contractors for the work. For further details on onlending, see paragraphs&#13;
3.18-3.19 in Chapter 3. The proposed implementation schedule is shown as Annex B.&#13;
C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.16          Procurement activities under the project will fall under one of two areas: (i) the central&#13;
purchase of technical and consulting assistance needed for designing and administering project activities;&#13;
and (ii) the procurement of city-level metering and retrofit goods and installation services. Procurement&#13;
and contracting for engineering, procurement and other professional services, which will be done in&#13;
accordance with the Bank Guidelines, will be carried out by the CPIU. Procurement of most metering&#13;
and retrofit installation services for cities will be on an ICB basis, and carried out with city participation&#13;
by the CPIU, with assistance from a procurement services firm. Contracts for metering and retrofit&#13;
installation will be signed by cities. With increased familiarity of competitive procurement, and as city&#13;
staff demonstrate a capacity for procurement administration, procurement functions will increasingly be&#13;
shifted to the LIGs.&#13;
4.17          A General Procurement Notice will be issued in the first quarter of 1996. Metering&#13;
installations (Phase I) will begin in the middle of 1996, before the building energy retrofits (Phase II)&#13;
because metering will be simpler to contract for and supervise. This will give the cities experience with&#13;
single responsibility contract administration before they contract for and begin administering the more&#13;
complex energy retrofit works activities. The Procurement and Engineering Group (PEG), which will be&#13;
hired through short-listing of procurement services firms, will support the CPIU in overall project&#13;
procurement administration. The PEG will also provide training and operational support for bid&#13;
preparations, evaluations and contracting activities. Contract administration consultants of the PEG will&#13;
train and guide the cities' LIG staffs with installation supervision, works acceptance and payment&#13;
administration responsibilities.&#13;
4.18          All Bank-financed works, goods and consulting services will be procured in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995), and&#13;
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981)&#13;
respectively. The Bank's standard bidding and contracting documentation will be used for ICB for&#13;
metering and energy retrofit installations, for (minor) metering installations and (minor) retrofit works,&#13;
and engaging consultant services. International Shopping (IS) and National Shopping (NS) procurement&#13;
will use commercial documentation acceptable to the Bank that will be adequate for later review and audit&#13;
purposes. The CPIU will be responsible for tracking procurement actions and approvals as well as&#13;
periodic reporting to the Bank on procurement progress. Additional details on expected procurement&#13;
actions are provided in Annex N. A summary of procurement categories and procurement methods is&#13;
shown in the following Table 4-1&#13;
Procurement of Works&#13;
4.19           Procurement of (Phase I) energy metering and (Phase II) building-systems retrofit&#13;
installations will be carried out primarily using the Bank's ICB procedures. While the preference will&#13;
be to contract for the works on a single-responsibility (equipment provision and installation) basis, there&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

may be smaller, isolated activities, or situations such as equipment standardization when metering or&#13;
retrofit equipment might more appropriately be centrally purchased and subsequently installed by the&#13;
cities under separate tenders.&#13;

4.20          (Major) Retrofit Works. Cities, with support from the CPIU, will procure building and&#13;
heatpoint metering installations and the installation of energy-saving retrofits in larger blocs of multi-&#13;
family dwellings using ICB procedures. These procurement actions will be in excess of US$1,000,000&#13;
per contract and will probably involve both foreign and domestic contractors. Joint ventures or other&#13;
forms of association will be encouraged to provide opportunities for participation of less experienced&#13;
firms. The PEG will work closely with the cities to ensure adherence to requirements of Bank&#13;
Guidelines. ICB metering and retrofit activities are expected to involve US$241 million and 22&#13;
contracting actions, averaging about US$11 million per contract.&#13;
4.21          (Minor)Retrofi Works. Because they would not be attractive to foreign suppliers, some&#13;
(minor) metering, facilities improvements and upstream retrofit installations that will be less than US$1&#13;
million per contract might be carried out using National Competitive Bidding (NCB).  Minor works&#13;
procurement procedures will be established by the CPIU's PEG. These procedures and included&#13;
documentation will be submitted by the CPIU (as part of its operations manual) to the Bank for review&#13;
and approval prior to their implementation. The Bank's standard documentation for smaller contracts (or&#13;
standard regional documentation) will be used for these procurements. The 39 expected NCB actions are&#13;
projected to total about US$34.5 million and average about US$885,000 per contract.'3&#13;
4.22          There are expected to be seven small-value, refurbishment and facilities improvement&#13;
contracts that would be undertaken using NS procedures. These transactions would be under US$150,000&#13;
each, average about US$106,000 each, and total US$745,000. Documentation will be based on the&#13;
Region's Standard Bidding Documents for Smaller Works Contracts (for contracts under US$250,000)&#13;
dated September 1995. These minor works contracts would be based on competition among interested&#13;
firms, obtaining sealed bids, public bid openings and structured evaluations. As the Bank's Country&#13;
Procurement Assessment Report has not yet been completed for Russia, these procurement actions and&#13;
resulting contracts will be subject to ex-post Bank review during supervision missions to ensure such&#13;
purchases were carried out in a manner consistent with Bank Guidelines.&#13;
Procurement of Goods&#13;
4.23           Procurement of goods and materials will involve: computers and communications links,&#13;
printing, document reproduction and other necessary office equipment, and some minor facilities upgrades&#13;
to accommodate CPIU and LIG operations. Metering and energy retrofit equipment and materials may&#13;
also fall into this category when smaller, isolated activities are involved, or the need for equipment&#13;
standardization emerges. Such procurement will be divided into the following categories:&#13;
4.24          ICB Procurement. As noted, preference will be to contract for the works on a single&#13;
responsibility (equipment provision and installation) basis. However, if it is determined that metering&#13;
or retrofit equipment is to be procured centrally, rather than as a part of city single-responsibility&#13;
installation contracts, ICB will cover the bulk of such procurement. ICB will be used for all purchases&#13;
of goods which are expected to exceed US$300,000 per contract. Of the total of approximately US$43&#13;
million allocated for the purchase of retrofit equipment (e.g., meters, valves, insulation materials, heat&#13;
controllers, office equipment), US$32 million or about 75 percent will be procured using ICB procedures.&#13;
The project is expected to have 8 ICB equipment purchases, averaging approximately US$4.0 million per&#13;
contract. In the comparison of bids for equipment purchased under ICB, Russian manufacturers would&#13;
be allowed a preferential margin of fifteen percent or the existing customs duty that a nonexempt importer&#13;
13/    Most upstream retrofits will not require loan participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 4. Project Implementation                                                    27&#13;
would have to pay, whichever is lower, over the competing price of imports. The Bank will perform&#13;
prior review of ICB procedures, bidding documents, evaluations and resulting contracts; and provide&#13;
comments or "No-Objection", as provided for in the Guidelines. The CPIU and its PEG will work with&#13;
the cities to ensure the efficient procurement and delivery of the centrally purchased items.&#13;
4.25         NCB.   Some metering and retrofit equipment purchases that will be less than&#13;
US$300,000 per contract might be carried out using NCB. These goods would be procured using NCB&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank. NCB purchases involving Bank funding are expected to be about&#13;
eighteen in number and average about US$190,000 each.&#13;
4.26         IS.  IS may be authorized for readily available, off-the-shelf retrofit and metering&#13;
equipment purchases under US$300,000 per contract. IS will be based on quotations from at least three&#13;
suppliers from at least two different Bank-member countries. IS is expected to total about US$1.9 million&#13;
and involve 12 purchases averaging about US$160,000 each. Bank reviews of IS actions will be&#13;
conducted on an ex-post basis during supervision missions or procurement reviews.&#13;
4.27         NS.   The CPIU will need to initiate a few small equipment purchases using NS&#13;
techniques. NS purchases are expected to cover contracts or purchase orders under US$50,000 each.&#13;
These purchases will also be used for small value transactions for facilities equipment, utility and systems&#13;
purchases, and readily available, off-the-shelf items. NS will also be used for minor purchases of&#13;
metering and retrofit materials, office supplies, equipment services and consumables. NS will be carried&#13;
out by obtaining at least three price quotations from different eligible suppliers. Such purchases will be&#13;
spread over the six-year duration of the project; and are expected to number about 60 transactions,&#13;
average about US$40,000 per contract and aggregate to approximately US$2.4 million. Small value NS&#13;
purchases will be subject ex-post documentation reviews, with payments probably being made through&#13;
the SA and Statements of Expenditure (SOEs).&#13;
4.28         Direct Contracting (DC). DC may be used in the procurement of proprietary metering&#13;
and retrofit devices, standardized equipment and/or spare parts. Examples noted to date are certain types&#13;
of flow controls and data loggers. Proprietary procurement is expected to involve 3 contracts and about&#13;
US$935,000. DC will be justified and all documentation, awards and contracting actions will be subject&#13;
to prior Bank review and clearance.&#13;
Procurement of Services&#13;
4.29         A total of about US$42.0 million is allocated for the procurement of professional and&#13;
technical services and will be provided by both individual experts and firms, Russian and foreign.&#13;
Contract periods will range from several months' duration to possibly over the life of the project for&#13;
engineering supervision. All consultants will be selected and employed following Bank Guidelines and&#13;
Standard Form of Contract for Consultants' Services-lump sum or time rate, as appropriate (July 1995).&#13;
Solicitation methods and TORs for all consulting assignments, as well as all procurement documentation,&#13;
shortlists and contracts with consulting firms valued at greater than US$100,000, will be subject to prior&#13;
Bank review and approval. Prior Bank review and approval will also be required for short lists and&#13;
contracts with individuals that are expected to exceed US$50,000 each. Individual consultants will be&#13;
selected from an evaluation of the CVs of at least three candidates.&#13;
4.30         There will be about 12 TA and consulting contracts with firms totaling approximately&#13;
US$26.8 million (about US$2.3 million each on average) at least over US$100,000 each and subject to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                                      Staff Appraisal Report: Russia Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project&#13;
prior Bank review and approval. There are expected to be seven contracts with individuals not directly&#13;
employed to work in the CPIU above US$50,000 each (averaging about US$80,000) and totaling about&#13;
US$560,000. The other expected consulting contracts with firms of less than US$100,000 each, and&#13;
contracts with individuals of less than US$50,000 each will together total about US$565,000 and will be&#13;
subject to ex-post reviews on a selective basis during supervision missions and/or as part of periodic&#13;
procurement implementation reviews. Wherever possible, TA-such as for engineering design and&#13;
supervision services-will be sought in consolidated packages to improve accountability and reduce costs&#13;
and administrative burdens.&#13;
4.31          Consulting Firrns' Services. Consultants will support the CPIU and cities with the&#13;
planning, development and administration of the energy-savings retrofit program. Two major consulting&#13;
assignments to support the CPIU and cities are expected for: (i) engineering design and technical services;&#13;
and (ii) procurement and construction contract supervision support (including quality control and works&#13;
acceptance activities). There will also be a need for some technical and engineering consulting assistance&#13;
at the cities' implementation offices. A technology advisory consultant is currently providing technology&#13;
management assistance under a contract partially financed by PPF. A new technology advisory contract&#13;
will be competitively bid upon within the next six months to ensure that an engineering consulting firm&#13;
is in place upon the termination of the existing contract. CPIU-procured consulting services will also&#13;
cover project accounting, audit, and short-term assistance, e.g., legal, financial services.&#13;
4.32          As noted in Chapter 3, Section G and Annex J, approximately US$2 million of TA for&#13;
policy implementation training will be financed by USAID. This is expected to cover three years of TA.&#13;
If grant financing should be terminated, or if the Government wishes to use some of the unallocated funds&#13;
under the loan to extend financing of TA for policy implementation beyond the 3 years, the contract will&#13;
be competitively bid out according to the procedures outlined above. Loan funds will not be used for&#13;
a sole-source extension of the bilaterally financed assignment of the contractors.&#13;
4.33          Individual Consultants. Individual consultants to be financed under the project include&#13;
the Director and staff of the CPIU. The CPIU will be responsible for personnel policy and for&#13;
supervision of the consultant selection process. For key project management positions, namely the&#13;
director and deputy directors of the CPIU, Bank "no objections" will be required. Prior Bank review&#13;
will not, however, be required for the appointment of support technical and office staff. A list of&#13;
individual positions requiring the Bank's prior review is given in Annex 0. A project staff contract will&#13;
be drawn up and agreed with the Bank prior to loan effectiveness to be used as a basis for all individuals&#13;
working as CPIU staff under the project. Individual contracts will usually be of up to one year in&#13;
duration but may be extended by mutual agreement. To facilitate the Bank's replenishment of the SA,&#13;
the CPIU will set up a payroll accounting system acceptable to the Bank.  Rather than require&#13;
documentation to support payment to each individual, the Bank will accept the documentation certified&#13;
by the CPIU covering payroll accounts.&#13;
Bank Procurement Supervision&#13;
4.34          ICB procurements of metering and retrofit services, ICB and DC purchases of retrofit&#13;
hardware and materials, and the first contracts for IS and NCB procurements will be subject to prior Bank&#13;
reviews and "no objections" as provided for in the Guidelines. Subsequent procurements of IS and NCB&#13;
equipment and single responsibility works contracts under US$1 million will be subject to post-review&#13;
during supervision missions. Procurement of consulting services will be subject to prior Bank review&#13;
for all consultancy TORs, procedures, documentation and contracting with firms over US$100,000 and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 4. Project Implementation                                                     29&#13;
with individuals over US$50,000. Procurements of goods and services will use the Bank's standard&#13;
bidding and contracting documents, modified or supplemented as necessary, with Bank prior approval.&#13;
This procurement plan will result in the Bank's prior reviews of approximately 83 percent of installation&#13;
contracts, 81 percent of equipment purchases, and 76 percent of total services procurement. In addition,&#13;
Bank staff will monitor procurement activities, contract administration, local purchases and project record&#13;
keeping during periodic supervision missions.&#13;
4.35         Documentation Processingand Reporting. The procurement services consultant will help&#13;
the CPIU with formulation of procurement administration plans and with the development of typical&#13;
documentation packages. The consultant will also help establish procurement procedures for the CPIU&#13;
and LIGs. These specialists will guide the preparation of standard documentation and, via consultations&#13;
and site visits, help program participants with detailed procurement planning, preparation of bid packages,&#13;
solicitations and evaluations, contracting and periodic procurement reporting requirements. These&#13;
procurement specialists will also help coordinate documentation flows needed to secure the World Bank's&#13;
clearances and "no objections" on consultants' TORs and services and equipment procurement&#13;
documentation needing prior Bank review. With assistance from their procurement services consultants,&#13;
the CPIU and LIGs will set up a procurement activities control and record keeping system, and report&#13;
periodically to the Bank regarding procurement actions, results and issues.&#13;
4.36         Procurement Reporting. Procurement information will be collected and recorded as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(i)   Information on procurement activities at the city level, including contract solicitations,&#13;
awards, supervision and amendments, will be aggregated by the CPIU and forwarded to&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
(ii)    Comprehensive quarterly reports will be prepared by the CPIU and forwarded to the&#13;
Bank on: overall procurement progress and project costing; revisions of cost estimates,&#13;
procurement schedules, disbursement progress and completion dates; and compliance with&#13;
prior reviews and aggregate limits on specified methods of Bank-financed procurement.&#13;
Additional details on project procurement can be found in Annex N.&#13;
D. DISBURSMENT&#13;
4.37         The proceeds of the loan are expected to be disbursed over a six-year period, with most&#13;
of the disbursement occurring between the 7th and 10th semesters of the disbursement period. The&#13;
estimated disbursement schedule is shown below in Table 4-2. Disbursements by category of expenditure&#13;
are shown in Table 4-3.&#13;
4.38         Requests for direct disbursement against contracts signed with cities will be made by the&#13;
CPIU to the Bank upon receipt of a signed request for disbursement from the city administration against&#13;
approved invoices submitted by contractors, suppliers, and consultants. The cities will be assisted by the&#13;
CPIU's technology and procurement/engineering advisors in approving or commissioning work completed&#13;
by contractors, suppliers, or consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

4.39          All such disbursements would be fully documented, except that SOEs will be used for:&#13;
expenditures under contracts of goods valued at less than US$100,000; expenditures under contracts of&#13;
individual consultants hired as CPIU personnel or valued at less than US$50,000 expenditures under&#13;
contracts of consultants' firms valued at less than US$100,000; and expenditures under contracts for civil&#13;
works valued at less than US$100,000. All pertinent documentation and records with regard to&#13;
disbursement would be retained by the CPIU and cities for at least one year after project completion.&#13;
In addition, documentation should be kept until project completion to allow for recovery of the special&#13;
account. Documentation would be made available for review by project auditors and by Bank staff on&#13;
request.&#13;

Special Account (SA)&#13;
4.40          To facilitate payments of small amounts and payment in local currency, the CPIU will&#13;
establish a SA denominated in US dollars in a commercial bank acceptable to the IBRD. The selection&#13;
process and qualifications of the chosen bank would be governed by the specific processes and criteria&#13;
described below. The maximum authorized allocation would be US$1 million. The initial deposit into&#13;
the account at project start will be US$300,000; this amount will be increased after the first year of&#13;
disbursement or when the Loan has reached US$1 million. All requests for replenishment would be&#13;
supported by documentation as described in para 6.31 of the Disbursement Handbook. The CPIU would&#13;
be responsible for reconciliation of project accounts with disbursements and replenishment requests, and&#13;
would forward these as supporting documents with each application for replenishment.&#13;
4.41          The commercial bank holding the SA would be chosen on the basis of open competitive&#13;
bidding, and would, as a pre-condition, be required to meet the following eligibility criteria:&#13;
(i)   it should be financially sound as demonstrated by their latest accounts which&#13;
would be audited by an internationally recognized audit firm;&#13;
(ii)   have significant foreign correspondence banking in all major currencies;&#13;
(iii)   have some experience, or at least the capacity to acquire experience, in issuing&#13;
letters of credit, transacting direct foreign payments;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

including regular statements, and any other information that may be considered&#13;
necessary;&#13;
(viii)  charge competitive rates for services and other transactions fees.&#13;
Project Accounts and Audits&#13;
4.42          The CPIU will establish and maintain a single set of project accounts, including the SA.&#13;
These records would be audited in accordance with the "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing&#13;
of Projects Financed by the World Bank" (March 1982). During negotiations, the Borrower would be&#13;
requested to provide, within six months of the end of each Government fiscal year, an audit report of&#13;
such scope and detail as the IBRD may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an&#13;
independent auditor acceptable to the IBRD, on disbursements against SOEs. The separate opinion should&#13;
mention whether SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and controls&#13;
involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawal applications. The&#13;
cities will establish budget items for duties and taxes payable under the project and also for their local&#13;
contributions relating to housing allowances and upstream retrofits. Detailed budget execution data will&#13;
be reviewed each year during the normal supervision process.&#13;
E. PROJECT MONITORING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
4.43          To ensure that project objectives are achieved, the CPIU will have to successfully&#13;
integrate monitoring of both the policy and investment components of the project. Monitoring of progress&#13;
in achieving policy objectives will be done in two ways. First, cities will be expected to meet, and will&#13;
be measured against, policy and institutional reform targets every year (see Annex T for Year 1 targets).&#13;
Second, cities will also be evaluated on their progress on policy reforms using the policy monitoring&#13;
indicators (see Table 4-4). Monitoring of the investment component will similarly be carried out along&#13;
two parallel tracks. Aggregate disbursement will be measured against the disbursement schedule set out&#13;
in Table 4-2, but investments will also be evaluated using the performance indicators (see Table 4-5).&#13;
Finally, the effectiveness of TA being channeled to cities under the project will be evaluated against&#13;
program output targets as well as beneficiary assessments. These evaluations will be integrated to form&#13;
a basis for the CPIU's annual operating plans and schedules for procurement and disbursement. All of&#13;
these elements will be included in the CPIU's assessment and reporting of annual progress for submission&#13;
to the Government and the Bank.&#13;
4.44          Annual reporting will be carried out in a three-stage process. On September 15 of every&#13;
year the CPIU will submit to the Bank an agreed upon work plan for each city for the next calendar year.&#13;
This will include a description of the size, nature, timing, and handling of procurement actions for each&#13;
city, and confirmation that both the LIGs and the CPIU have adequate resources to handle the aggregate&#13;
workload. Subsequently in November, the CPIU will carry out preliminary assessments of each city's&#13;
performance against the annual policy and institutional reform targets for that year, and propose new&#13;
targets for the next calendar year. These targets, upon confirmation by the Bank, will be communicated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 4. Project Implementation                                                           33&#13;
to the cities by the CPIU. By March 1 the CPIU will carry out final assessments of city performance&#13;
against annual policy and institutional targets and submit to the Bank for its no-objection recommendations&#13;
whether each city should continue to be eligible to participate in that year's investment cycle. Included&#13;
in this report will be a detailed executed budget from each city for the last calendar year detailing both&#13;
local contributions and tax payments related to project expenditures.&#13;
4.45          The CPIU will also be responsible for monthly and quarterly reporting of project data,&#13;
including: overall procurement progress and project costing (including local contributions); revisions of&#13;
cost estimates; procurement schedules; disbursement progress and completion dates; and compliance with&#13;
prior reviews and aggregate limits on specified methods of bank-financed procurement. This includes&#13;
gathering data, if any, from LIGs and other project participants, including bilateral donors. Details on&#13;
what data will be reported monthly and what data on a quarterly basis will be specified in Operating&#13;
Guidelines to be agreed with the Bank. As necessary, the CPIU will work with the LIGs to establish&#13;
project budgeting and accounting systems to track both Bank and non-Bank project funding.&#13;
4.46          In the period prior to the mid-term review scheduled for this project, the CPIU will&#13;
prepare, on the basis of the most recent annual report described above, a strategy paper justifying either&#13;
continuation of project implementation as described in the original project and loan documents, or a&#13;
revised plan of action. This will be submitted to the Bank six weeks before the scheduled supervision&#13;
mnission.&#13;
Monitoring Indicators&#13;
4.47          Two types of indicators are proposed to monitor this project. The first are policy-level&#13;
indicators related to the project's development impact. These pertain to the policy and institutional&#13;
reforms required of project cities and range from enterprise divestiture to housing sector reform.&#13;
Specifically, the primary objective of this project ir to accelerate and make sustainable the divestiture of&#13;
housing from enterprises. Quantitative targets for divestiture for all project cities are detailed below. In&#13;
order to meet this primary objective, the project is also designed to encourage a wider range of reforms,&#13;
ranging from housing sector reforms to energy efficiency to fiscal restructuring of housing sector&#13;
expenditures at the municipal level. These reforms can be measured, in some cases quantitatively. Such&#13;
indicators, ranging from rates of cost recovery to the proportion of the housing stock placed under&#13;
competitive maintenance or management, are outlined below. The demonstration effect of this project&#13;
will be achieved if: (a) divestiture is completed by 1997; (b) the rate of other policy reforms in the&#13;
project cities outpace the rate of reforms nationwide; and (c) housing affordability in project cities is&#13;
increased.&#13;
4.48          Second are performance indicator targets, to monitor delivery of project inputs and&#13;
achievement of project outputs, referring specifically to the investment and TA components of the project.&#13;
Savings in energy consumption in the retrofitted buildings, and the corresponding reduction of outlays&#13;
by both the city and the tenants will be monitored on an annual basis in every project city. These will&#13;
be measured against the without-project scenario projected from baseline data collected during the first&#13;
year of the project. Separately, the effectiveness of TA and training will be measured indirectly by the&#13;
measurement of reforms achieved in each of the areas of TA, but also through annual interviews and&#13;
surveys of the recipients of TA.&#13;
&#13;

Supervision&#13;
4.49          Higher than average Bank supervision, with timely field visits, will be essential to achieve&#13;
project goals. Because this is a new program for the CPIU and cities, and because the technology and&#13;
application concepts are evolving, more intense Bank supervision will be needed in the early stages of&#13;
implementation. A supervision schedule is contained in Annex M. A mid-term review will be held in&#13;
lieu of the third annual review.&#13;
4.50          Bank supervision will begin with a project launch mission at loan effectiveness and a&#13;
supervision mission no more than three months thereafter to ensure implementation systems are in place&#13;
and that participants understand the Bank's procurement, disbursement and project accounting processes.&#13;
Following this, at least two supervision missions a year will be scheduled, to discuss or participate in the&#13;
annual assessments carried out by the CPIU every year. These initial missions will cover all policy,&#13;
physical, and financial aspects of the project. The supervision missions are expected to involve the Task&#13;
Manager, financial and economic specialists from Headquarters, and procurement and technical&#13;
specialists, including possibly sociologists and environmental experts. Missions will review the CPIU's&#13;
assessment of implementation issues and progress toward targets, and CPIU plans for work and remedial&#13;
action. Bank supervision missions will also include field visits to project cities, and city officials and&#13;
tenants will be interviewed. The project's technology and procurement/engineering consultants will also&#13;
be interviewed to ensure progress is being made in contracting and installation of building retrofits. In&#13;
addition, the CPIU's annual reports will provide the basis for supervision missions in the last quarter of&#13;
each project year to assess progress during the previous period, achievement of project milestones and&#13;
discuss work plans for the next year.&#13;
4.51          Based on the mid-term project strategy prepared by the CPIU, the Bank will conduct a&#13;
detailed mid-term review approximately 30 months after loan effectiveness to review a range of project&#13;
issues. It will be held in lieu of the third annual policy reform review for the cities, and be expanded&#13;
in scope to include not only progress against annual reform targets, but issues related to implementation&#13;
capacity, rates of disbursement, decentralization of management, municipal creditworthiness, and possible&#13;
reallocations of funds among cities. At this timne each city's progress in implementing the investment&#13;
component of the project will be carefully reviewed to determine whether LIGs could be tasked with&#13;
increasing responsibility for procurement and disbursement. Implementation capacity as evidenced by&#13;
disbursement rates will also be used to determine whether undisbursed sub-loan anounts might be&#13;
reallocated among cities.&#13;
4.52          A Project Completion Report and wrap-up audit will be prepared by the CPIU at the end&#13;
of the program, as required by Bank guidelines.&#13;

V. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
5.1           This chapter discusses the benefits, costs, and risks of the project. Section A contains&#13;
an extensive analysis of the project benefits and costs by project component. Section B reviews how the&#13;
interests of different stakeholders are being accounted for to ensure that the project benefits are achieved.&#13;
Section B also looks at project risks and how these risks can be mitigated. Section C discusses&#13;
sustainability issues and is followed by sections on the project's poverty and environmental impacts.&#13;
A. PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
5.2           The project's main objective and intended benefit is to facilitate enterprise restructuring&#13;
by allowing them to divest their responsibility for housing services. Making the divestiture process&#13;
affordable and sustainable will in tum require a range of reforms and investments. These reforms and&#13;
investments will themselves yield a wide range of subsidiary benefits to many different beneficiaries. The&#13;
greatest benefits will probably derive from the policy and institutional reforms, even though many of&#13;
these gains are non-quantifiable. Though the quantifiable net benefits from the project are substantial,&#13;
they will be enhanced further in combination with policy reforms. The synergy created between&#13;
investments and reforms will increase overall project benefits. In addition, the project is expected to have&#13;
demonstration effects for the country as a whole (see Box 5-1).&#13;
Box 5-1. ElUP Demomstmon Effects&#13;
Examples of EHDP nationwide demonstration effects include:&#13;
*   Sustainable approaches to housing divestiture&#13;
*   Financially viable schemes for reducing costs and increasing confort in housing stock in ways that&#13;
create local service industries and labor demand;&#13;
* Benefits of competitive bidding for services currently provided by public sector monopolies;&#13;
*   Ways to protect vulnerable households through housing allowances;&#13;
*   Means to improve regulation and governance of utRiites&#13;
5.3           In some instances net costs will emerge for various stakeholders in spite of mitigation&#13;
measures included in the project. In addition, even when the benefits of policy reform can be quantified&#13;
(e.g., fiscal gains from increased cost recovery), comparing the EHDP project outcome to a "without-&#13;
project" scenario is problematic, since the pace of reform in non-project cities is difficult to forecast.&#13;
The most easily quantifiable benefits are those arising from the energy efficiency retrofits. For these&#13;
investments, the without-project scenario (i.e., such investments will not be made) is more&#13;
straightforward, and an Economic Rate of Return/Financial Rate of Return (ERR/FRR) analysis is&#13;
possible, along with a calculation of environmental gains through reduced pollution.&#13;
&#13;

5.4           Table 5-1 summarizes the benefits and costs attributable to each of the following project&#13;
outcomes:&#13;
*      Housing Divestiture&#13;
*      Housing Reforms&#13;
*      Utility Metering&#13;
*      Energy Efficiency Retrofits&#13;
5.5           The following paragraphs then discuss the benefits in more detail. FRRs and ERRs are&#13;
calculated for the energy efficiency retrofits, and the net quantifiable benefits and costs from the full&#13;
package of reforms and investments is described for key stakeholders-enterprises, cities, and households.&#13;
Section B provides the general approach to stakeholder analysis, and Annex I provides further&#13;
information on the each of the stakeholders affected by the project.&#13;

5.6             By the end of the project, it is expected that 95-100 percent of the eligible housing in&#13;
each project city will be divested from enterprises. This will allow enterprises to focus on their core&#13;
business activities, making it easier to restructure their operations to be competitive in a market&#13;
environment. It is difficult to quantify the impact of divestiture on enterprises. Because of the complex&#13;
tax deductibility rules for the costs of housing provision, the net financial benefits to most enterprises&#13;
will be modest; however (again because of taxation rules), the benefit will be significant for enterprises&#13;
that currently maintain a lot of housing. Nonetheless, even this modest financial gain to the enterprise&#13;
will facilitate wage adjustment, which is critical to achieving and sustaining high degrees of cost recovery&#13;
in the housing sector even as energy prices increase. Another non-quantifiable benefit of divestiture will&#13;
derive from relieving enterprise managers of the organizations and management burden of providing&#13;
housing and in some cases, utility and maintenance services. In addition, since maintaining the housing&#13;
may require up to ten percent of the enterprise's workers, divestiture will allow the firm to streamline&#13;
its labor force.&#13;
5.7           Divestiture will impose short-term financial and managerial costs on city administrations.&#13;
Unless these costs are mitigated, divestiture will simply shift the burden of housing provision from the&#13;
enterprises to the cities, which is not a desirable or sustainable outcome. Under the project, divestiture&#13;
will therefore be accompanied by housing reforms and investments to reduce the costs of operating the&#13;
housing stock (see below). Workers from former enterprise housing maintenance units will continue to&#13;
maintain the housing stock, but as employees of newly corporatized or privatized maintenance companies&#13;
that will participate in the competitive bidding process required of cities which are included in the project.&#13;
Housing Reforms&#13;
5.8           Participating cities will implement broad agenda of reforms to increase the private sector's&#13;
role in housing finance, ownership, and management. Participating cities are required to reach 100&#13;
percent cost recovery for housing maintenance and utilities by 1998. This is critical, since housing&#13;
subsidies have increasingly been crowding out sorely needed public investment in basic infrastructure,&#13;
which is crumbling in mnany cities. However, to protect vulnerable households, targeted housing&#13;
allowances will be implemented. The housing allowance scheme being supported in project cities is the&#13;
best means-tested social safety net measure currently under implementation in Russia, and it can serve&#13;
as a model or intermediary step for the establishment of a wider social safety net nationwide.&#13;

5.9            Participating cities will also take measures to stimulate housing privatization, and in&#13;
particular condominium development. The benefits from this include better stewardship of the housing&#13;
stock as residents themselves gain control over its management. This will in tum reduce the city's&#13;
managerial burden. In addition, housing privatization and the emergence of housing markets will lead&#13;
to improved labor mobility. These benefits, while unquantifiable, are undoubtedly substantial. However,&#13;

privatization will impose organizational and administrative costs on households, since they will have to&#13;
form condominium associations and begin to manage maintenance and other contracts through these&#13;
associations.&#13;
5.10          Finally, participating cities will be required to institute competitive bidding for&#13;
maintenance. This will break the monopoly of the existing city-owned maintenance companies and&#13;
encourage the emergence of new private firms. The resulting competition among providers is expected&#13;
over the longer term to lower costs and increase quality. (The existing quality of housing maintenance&#13;
is particularly poor in most Russian cities.) Competitive bidding has already been done with USAID&#13;
support in several cities and the initial results are generally positive, with residents' satisfaction up and&#13;
costs lower than or equal to those of city-owned companies. Successful implementation of competitive&#13;
bidding in project cities is expected to have a rapid demonstration effect, because elected city officials&#13;
are increasingly looking for ways to improve residents' satisfaction with housing services. As with any&#13;
nascent market, there are instances where inexperienced new firms fail to deliver their promised level of&#13;
service, causing short-term problems. The biggest cost will be imposed on former city-owned housing&#13;
maintenance companies that will lose their monopoly position.&#13;
Utility Metering&#13;
5.11            Phase I of the project will finance the installation of meters, primarily for heat and hot&#13;
water, which are relatively low cost and have substantial benefits. The exact returns to meters are&#13;
difficult to quantify because of the large number of technical and behavioral parameters in the project.&#13;
However, a range of magnitude can be provided by reference to the Gas Distribution and Energy&#13;
Efficiency Project, which estimated that the economic rate of return to the installation of gas meters will&#13;
range from 55 percent at the apartment level to several hundred percent at the industrial user level. Under&#13;
that project, improved meters will be installed for commercial customers, since the old meters were found&#13;
to significantly under-record actual consumption. At the residential level, there was no metering prior&#13;
to the project. The rates of return are based on the projection that metering, in conjunction with&#13;
liberalized gas prices, will lead to a 25 percent reduction in gas usage by commercial and residential&#13;
consumers.&#13;
5.12          Experience worldwide-including recently in Russia-demonstrates that appropriate&#13;
metering can provide major incentives for efficiency. Discussions with officials of EHDP cities revealed&#13;
a strong commitment to investments in metering for this reason. The first effect of metering will be to&#13;
isolate losses within the distribution system and the ability to detect over-reporting of deliveries by heat&#13;
companies, a capacity entirely lacking in most Russian cities. Isolating losses within the distribution&#13;
system will not save money for cities immediately since they own and finance the heating distribution&#13;
companies. However, this information will enable them to create incentives for the management of these&#13;
distribution companies to reduce losses, which can often be done through relatively inexpensive changes&#13;
in operations. As losses are reduced in a cost-effective manner, cities (and households, as cost recovery&#13;
is phased in) will begin to reap financial savings. In the case where the city is buying heating from a&#13;
regional cogeneration plant (TETs), installing meters to measure actual purchases may result in actual&#13;
savings to the city if the TETs has been over-reporting heat deliveries, as is often alleged. Depending&#13;
on the importance to the TETs of the resultant lost revenue, it may try to recover its losses through&#13;
higher tariffs charged to the city. However, tariffs charged by the TETs are regulated by the regional&#13;
authorities (see Annex Q), which have an interest in avoiding over-charging because they are guaranteeing&#13;
the sub-loans to the cities under EHDP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 5. Benefits and Risks                                                                 41&#13;
5.13          The second benefit from metering will derive from behavioral changes by consumers as&#13;
cities phase in billing by actual consumption. There are technical difficulties with metering heat use at&#13;
the apartment level, but in many instances sections of buildings can be metered, which reduces free-rider&#13;
problems as compared with metering full buildings. For behavioral changes to occur, residents must also&#13;
have a way of controlling their consumption, requiring the use of thermostatic or manual valves or other&#13;
such measures, though even closing windows can have a substantial effect on energy use under certain&#13;
circumstances. Despite these c.;veats, participating city officials overwhelmingly agree that metering at&#13;
the building or subsection level will have adequate incentive effects to justify the investment if metering&#13;
is not possible at a more disaggregated level. While acknowledging that billing by consumption will have&#13;
some equity effects because of different characteristics in the housing stock within the city, they believe&#13;
that these problems can be overcome. In the social survey undertaken during project preparation, a&#13;
majority of residents expressed interest in being billed by consumption. One effect of such billing will&#13;
be to reveal the true asset value of different buildings and apartment locations within buildings-sending&#13;
price signals that will improve allocative efficiency within the housing sector.&#13;
Energy Efriciency Retrofits&#13;
5.14          The main quantifiable benefits from the project will derive from the energy efficiency&#13;
investments to be implemented under Phase II of the project. In addition, experience in OECD countries&#13;
shows that housing energy efficiency programs can generate a large demand for local labor and lead to&#13;
the emergence of local energy service industries-an effect that is hard to quantify in advance. Increased&#13;
energy efficiency will translate into savings for the economy primarily through reduced consumption of&#13;
natural gas and other fossil fuels that can be exported or diverted to other valuable uses. Energy&#13;
efficiency will translate into financial savings for the local budgets and households as well. Reduced&#13;
energy consumption within buildings will translate into reduced fuel and operating costs for utility&#13;
providers. These savings will be passed on to local budgets and households through reduced charges&#13;
from the utility companies based on metered deliveries. At the beginning of the project, when household&#13;
utility tariffs are still set at low levels, the city budgets will get most of the financial savings from reduced&#13;
utility consumption since cities will be able to reduce the subsidies they pay. Over the longer term, as&#13;
households begin to pay a higher percentage of actual utility costs, they will begin to accrue more of the&#13;
financial savings. The following paragraphs discuss the FRR and ERR to the retrofits in more detail.&#13;
5.15          FRR. The financial analysis examines the combined financial returns to city budgets and&#13;
households. As noted above, the sharing of savings between city budgets and households will depend&#13;
on the cost recovery ratio for utility services. However, even when tariffs are set at full cost recovery&#13;
levels, cities will still accrue benefits from reduced energy charges because of budget-financed housing&#13;
allowances for the poorest households. Energy efficiency investments generally involve a package of&#13;
measures. In general, the marginal rate of return to a package declines as additional measures are added.&#13;
The packages to be financed under EHDP will be designed to have an average payback of less than five&#13;
years in financial terms at the city level. The primary parameters for this analysis are the cost of heat&#13;
(currently US$22.8/Gcal'4, based on a gas price of US$60 per thousand rn3) and the cost of efficiency&#13;
measures, including taxes and duties. Under the scenarios outlined in Annex F, this implies an average&#13;
financial rate of return (FRR) of approximately 50 percent"5. The investment packages will vary across&#13;
building types and climatic zones, and will be adjusted over the course of the project as energy and other&#13;
14/    A number of price and taxation changes currently pending could raise this price substantially, raising the FRR.&#13;
15/    This is based on the assumption that the Project will finance retrofits mainly in large and medium size buildings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

prices change. Technical considerations, especially related to building size and characteristics, mean that&#13;
payback periods for different buildings will vary from 2 to 3 years, implying a corresponding variation&#13;
in FRRs from 40 to 55 percent.&#13;
5.16           ERR. The economic analysis examines returns to Russian Federation as a whole. The&#13;
primary adjustments financial prices are a netting out of taxes and duties on project-financed investments&#13;
(approximately 15 percent) and use of opportunity costs for energy, primarily natural gas for generation&#13;
and district heating. Although Russia is a net gas exporter, there are physical and other constraints to&#13;
export capacity that will endure for the next decade. Consequently, following the analysis under the Gas&#13;
Distribution and Energy Efficiency Project, gas is valued at its LRMC of production, which is currently&#13;
estimated at US$45 per thousand m3. This translates into a heat cost of US$16.50/Gcal. Following these&#13;
adjustments, the average economic rate of return (ERR) to the retrofit packages is estimated at 40 percent,&#13;
with the returns to individual packages varying between 32 and 45 percent.&#13;
5.17           In cases where the energy savings from the retrofits enable cities to avoid or defer new&#13;
capital investments in utility generation capacity, the FRR and ERR rise by an estimated ten percent.&#13;
Some EHDP cities currently face a shortage of heating capacity in certain parts of the city, and without&#13;
the project, they would be forced to invest in construction of new boilers. These avoided savings are&#13;
valued using the following assumptions: (i) a current heat shortage amounts to half of the annual energy&#13;
savings derived from the building retrofit, and (ii) the total investment costs for a typical natural gas&#13;
fired boiler plant are about $30,000 per Gcal/Hour of generation capacity. Since it is not yet clear how&#13;
much investment in new capacity will be deferred due to the retrofits, these higher rates of return have&#13;
not been factored in the averages cited in the previous two paragraphs.&#13;
Net Financial Benefits to Enterprise, Cities, and Households&#13;
5.18           This section estimates the net financial benefits to enterprises, cities, and households from&#13;
the project on a per apartment basis. See Annex S for more details, including a discussion of the impacts&#13;
expressed as a percentage of existing households spending or local budgets, and mechanisms for financial&#13;
returns to cities from retrofits. In summary, divestiture will result in modest gains for enterprises as their&#13;
tax burden will increase following divestiture.  Cities would correspondingly bear only modest&#13;
incremental costs in the short term. However, in the medium term as heat prices rise, the full cost to&#13;
city budgets of maintaining the housing stock (both municipal and divested) will rise dramatically unless&#13;
cost recovery from households is raised.'6 If cost recovery is increased, the cities will accrue very large&#13;
net benefits even with divestiture. Increased cost recovery will in tum impose a burden on households,&#13;
however.   The project is designed  to  mitigate  these  costs to  households  through  several&#13;
measures-housing allowances for poor households and energy efficiency retrofits to reduce housing costs&#13;
for all households and general housing refomis, which will reduce costs for both households and cities.&#13;
Average household income are expected to rise by 3-4 percent from savings in utility expenditures.&#13;
Annex R provides an analysis of the affordability of cost recovery increases for households over the&#13;
medium term. In addition, households will benefit from the increased demand for local labor generated&#13;
by the project. Local firms and workers will likely carry out many of the subcontracts for the civil works&#13;
in the project which is expected to result in about 0.75 percent increase in local employment.&#13;
16/    In 1994, city budgets spent the equivalent of 4 percent of GDP on housing subsidies. This could rise to 7 percent&#13;
without aggressive implementation of cost recovery and other reforms and investments promoted under the project. See 1995&#13;
CEM (Russian Federation: Towards Medium-Term Viability, World Bank Report No. 14472-RU).&#13;

Chapter 5. Benefits and Risks                                                                          43&#13;
5.19            Table 5-2 shows the costs and benefits from the project to different stakeholders on aper&#13;
apartment basis in year 6, when policy and institutional reforms are in place and the energy efficiency&#13;
retrofits are generating cost savings. Under this scenario, the city has reached 100 percent cost recovery&#13;
and instituted a housing allowance for households spending more than 20 percent of their incomes on&#13;
housing. This is compared to a "without-project" scenario in which cost recovery reaches only 50 percent&#13;
and divestiture does not take place. For simplicity, the analysis assumes that the city repays the entire&#13;
Bank loan, but this assumption can easily be modified to show the effects of loan repayments by&#13;
households through depreciation charges. For reference, the cost of operating an apartment in Year 6&#13;
without the project would be US$700, of which US$500 would be for utility costs. With the project,&#13;
costs are expected to fall to US$530, of which US$330 would be for utilities.&#13;
5.20            Because enterprises lose the ability to deduct housing costs after divestiture, they pay&#13;
higher taxes as a result, and thus the net financial gain for enterprises is modest. Although the effect&#13;
varies according to the characteristics of the enterprise and how much housing it previously maintained,&#13;
the savings would on average be US$38 per apartment.&#13;
5.21            The household sector will bear a gross financial cost (US$350/apartment) under the&#13;
project because of the increase in cost recovery. Increased cost recovery is seen as a necessary and&#13;
desirable objective in creating a private housing sector and freeing up government revenues for basic&#13;
infrastructure and social services. However, this increased burden on the household sector will be&#13;
mitigated under the project in several ways. The retrofits will reduce costs by US$170/apartment,&#13;
housing allowances will provide an average US$45/apartment, and metering and general housing reforms&#13;
are expected to reduce housing costs by US$70/apartment. The net cost to the household sector would&#13;
thus be only US$65/apartment. For individual households eligible for housing allowances, the net cost&#13;
would be lower-in many cases zero.&#13;

project team. These are described in Box 5-3.&#13;
B. STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, AND RISK MITIGATION&#13;
Stakeholder Analysis&#13;
5.25            To achieve the benefits discussed above, it is critical to take into account the interests&#13;
of many different stakeholders.  The stakeholder analysis focused primarily on two groups of&#13;
stakeholders: 1) primary or key stakeholders with relatively little influence over the project, and 2)&#13;
secondary stakeholders with potentially high influence over the implementation of the project. The first&#13;
group was identified so that a participatory approach to incorporate their views and concerns in project&#13;

amortization period than the sub-loan amortization period faced by the cities under the Project.&#13;

implementation design could be devised. The second group was identified to ensure that they were either&#13;
brought into the project to facilitate its implementation, or prevented from affecting the project negatively.&#13;
(See Table 5.3 for classification of stakeholders.)&#13;
Stakeholders of high importance but with low influence over the project:&#13;
5.26          Enterprises are primary beneficiaries of the divestiture process, but they have surprisingly&#13;
little direct influence on the pace or nature of the divestiture process. Project preparation incorporated&#13;
Box 5-3. Project Alternatives Examined&#13;
The following alternatives to the current project were examined.&#13;
1. Strengthening budget suvpPrt for enterprise housing divestiture based on the transfers from the federal&#13;
budget without either additional investments in energy savings or additional effors fostering reforms in&#13;
municipal housing. While such an approach would accelerate housing divestiture in the medium-term, it&#13;
is not a sustainable strategy in long run.  Considering the Russian fiscal environment, municipal&#13;
governments must pursue fundamental reforms to reduce deman for budget subsidies in housing. This&#13;
can be achieved only by reforming the housing sector and developing bousing markets.&#13;
2. Reforming existing housing institutions, which might include tightening budget constrainus and&#13;
improving corporate governance for housing maintenance organizations and local utilities in order to reduce&#13;
the total costs of operating housing costs. The potential gains of such a strategy would be relatively small&#13;
until housing privatization was completed (including the widespread establishment of condominium&#13;
associations) and competition in the housing sector emerged. Although the project as designed does not&#13;
rely fully on this strategy, it has incorporated some policy conditions intended to increase the in&#156;itutional&#13;
capacity of municipal administrations to monitor and regulate natural monopolies in the sector.&#13;
3. Energy saving investments in utility aeneration and distribution networks instead of investing in&#13;
residential buildings. While investing in utility corapanits might have high financial retums in Russia,&#13;
investing in the existing housing stock has two advantages: first, it is more closely linked to the housing&#13;
reforms supported under the project, and second, it has the added benefits of directly increasing the quality&#13;
of life of households through improved comfort. While local utility companies either have or shortly will&#13;
have access to commercial lending for upgrading their facilities, by contrast, there are currently many&#13;
institutional and informational barriers to commercial financing of housing retrofits in Russia. Building-&#13;
level retrofits are much more labor intensive than upstream retrofits, and the project is expected to create&#13;
related local service industries in each participating city. Energy efficiency retrofits also increases thm asset&#13;
value of the housing, which over the longer term can be captuted by residents who privatize their&#13;
apartment units.&#13;
this finding by carrying out interviews of enterprises managers in every city which competed for final&#13;
inclusion in the project, as well as through a survey which was carried out in nine geographically&#13;
dispersed cities (of which one has been included in the project) in Russia. The interviews and surveys&#13;
sought to clarify the net impact of divestiture for enterprises, the type of restructuring that was precluded&#13;
by enterprises which were held responsible for the maintenance of social assets, and to investigate the&#13;
perceived obstacles to divestiture.&#13;
&#13;

5.27           Tenants are primary beneficiaries of the energy efficiency investments to be financed&#13;
under the project. They too, however, have little voice in the process, since decisions on-as well as the&#13;
financial means for-capital investment in housing are still largely controlled by enterprises or municipal&#13;
administrations. Several ways of including them in the decision-making process were considered. Some,&#13;
including the idea of forming and giving a voice to tenant associations in each building, were discarded&#13;
because of the history of forced participation under socialism; others, such as the idea of holding general&#13;
meetings with tenants, were opposed by other stakeholders. Two approaches were ultimately agreed upon&#13;
as the most appropriate way to incorporate the views and concerns of tenants into the project design and&#13;
implementation process. First, surveys of tenant preferences have been conducted to provide input into&#13;
the design of both retrofit packages. The information from such surveys will also be used to design&#13;
public information campaigns during project implementation. Second, the establishment of condominium&#13;
associations under the project has been promoted as the most voluntary way to encourage active resident&#13;
participation in the decision making process.&#13;
Stakeholders of low importance to project objectives but high influence over implementation:&#13;
5.28          To ensure implementation of the project, stakeholders with the capacity to strongly&#13;
influence the implementation of the project-but of relatively low importance to meeting the objectives&#13;
of the project-have also been identified. Once identified, the project has tried to ensure that such&#13;
stakeholders can be prevented from affecting the project negatively. Each of these stakeholders have been&#13;
approached at early stages of project preparation to: (i) assess whether they faced any incentives to oppose&#13;
the project; and (ii) determnine how the risk of their opposition to the project might be mitigated.&#13;

5.29          For two such stakeholders-the city maintenance organizations and the city utility&#13;
enterprises (primarily heat and hot water)-the project is likely to have significant and immediate impact&#13;
on the way they conduct their work, as well as possibly their survival over the long term. Fortunately,&#13;
these entities are both juridically, and in most cases, managerially controlled by the city administration&#13;
as they are directly subsidized via the city budget. In addition, city maintenance organizations may&#13;

Chapter 5. Benefits and Risks                                                               47&#13;
benefit from the project by subcontracting with metering and retrofit installation contractors. These&#13;
organizations are also subject to formal municipal regulation. However, the risk that municipal utilities&#13;
might try to oppose the shutdown of boilers (caused by end-use energy efficiency) by increasing costs in&#13;
their surviving operations exists, and can only be countered by building up municipal regulatory capacity.&#13;
Some of this risk is mitigated by the metering financed under the loan, which will increase cities'&#13;
capabilities to regulate their utility enterprises.&#13;
5.30          For the combined heat and electricity enterprises (TETs), the impact of the project relative&#13;
to their overall interests is small-purchased heat from the TETs will only be reduced after demand&#13;
reductions are met by supply reductions from higher cost city-owned boilers. In addition, consultations&#13;
with both the city administrations and the appropriate regional energy commissions about the risk that&#13;
the TETs might increase the price of heat sold to cities to compensate for reduced sales suggest that such&#13;
risks are relatively small. Moreover, federal policy on natural monopoly regulation has increased its&#13;
emphasis on improving the capacity of regional energy commissions.&#13;
5.31          Participation of the oblast administration is important to the project insofar as onlending&#13;
agreements from the Ministry of Finance to city administrations can only be concluded with an oblast&#13;
guarantee. The risk that the oblast administrations might refuse to give this guarantee has been mitigated&#13;
by approaching them early in project preparation and making it clear to cities that oblast guarantees for&#13;
onlending agreements were a non-negotiable prerequisite for final inclusion in the project. In the process&#13;
it has become clear that most oblast administrations believe that the project will benefit not only the cities&#13;
but the regions as well, and actively support the project.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
5.32          The key variables that could affect the viability of investments under the project are: i)&#13;
the unit cost and volume of energy saved, and ii) the cost of the retrofit measures. Implications of&#13;
changes in these factors are outlined below and discussed in more detail in Annex F.&#13;
5.33          The unit cost of energy saved under the project is a primarily a function of the cost of&#13;
natural gas, which is not expected to decline substantially during the life of the project in either financial&#13;
or economic terms. (The LRMC of production provides a floor for economic costs and a likely floor for&#13;
financial costs). The confidence interval around the estimated volume of energy saved is wider, however.&#13;
The unit cost or volume (or combination thereof) of heat saved would have to decline by more than 60&#13;
percent in financial and economic terms to reduce the FRR and ERR to 10 percent for medium size&#13;
buildings.&#13;
5.34          The total installed cost of the retrofit measures is a function of a number of variables,&#13;
including equipment, materials, and labor, as discussed below. The overall retrofit costs could increase&#13;
by 175 percent and 100 percent in financial and economic terms, respectively, before the FRR and ERR&#13;
would fall to 10 percent for medium-size buildings. This increase is much higher for large buildings.&#13;
The financial returns to cities and households from the retrofits will also depend on tax and duty rates,&#13;
which could fluctuate substantially over the life of the project. However, the average tax rate for total&#13;
installed costs would have to rise over ten-fold before the FRR would decline to 10 percent.&#13;
5.35          The estimated cost of equipment and materials is based on an extensive market survey,&#13;
with most of the equipment produced outside Russia. Price movements for this equipment are hard to&#13;
predict, but there is no reason to expect Russia border prices for them to rise substantially except for a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48                                           Staff Appraisal Report: Russia Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project&#13;
devaluation of the ruble. In fact, declines have been noted in the price of many relatively high-&#13;
technology efficiency devices as demand rises. In addition, there are good prospects that certain types&#13;
of equipment and materials can be efficiently produced locally, which would bring down investment costs&#13;
for the project. Equipment costs could rise by more than 350 percent and 300 percent in financial and&#13;
economic terms, respectively, before the FRR and ERR declined to 10 percent.&#13;
5.36           The cost of labor is a much greater uncertainty and depends in turn on two factors: (i)&#13;
the mix between foreign and local workers used, and (ii) changes in Russian wages. The baseline&#13;
assumption is that because these measures have not been installed widely in Russia to date, approximately&#13;
20 percent of the labor will be foreign. This figure would be higher in the early years of the project and&#13;
decline toward the end as local laborers were trained. The cost or amount of foreign labor could rise by&#13;
over 800 and over 700 percent in financial and economic terms, respectively, before the rate of return&#13;
to the project declined to 10 percent. Wage dynamics in the Russian economy are very difficult to predict&#13;
as well. Since local labor costs are currently such a small percentage of overall investment costs,&#13;
however, local wages could rise more than twenty-fold before the FRR and ERR declined to 10 percent.&#13;
Risk Mitigation&#13;
5.37           Figure 5-1 presents an overview of the risk mitigation strategy. A major risk under the&#13;
project is that the cities selected will not complete the divestiture process or not sustain the reform&#13;
momentum necessary to make divestiture sustainable. For example, the pace at which cost recovery and&#13;
competitive maintenance can be introduced is uncertain and involves a number of complex (and often&#13;
unresolved) legal and institutional issues. This risk has already been mitigated in two ways: (i) by&#13;
undertaking the Stakeholder Analysis in the section above, and (ii) by selecting cities which have&#13;
implemented reforms as a condition for selection in the project, thereby demonstrating a commitment to&#13;
divestiture and reform. With regard to cost recovery, participating cities have also agreed to invest in&#13;
a new computerized rent collection system as part of their local contribution to the project. During&#13;
implementation, the cities will have to meet annual reform targets as a condition of remaining for the&#13;
project. The project will provide TA to help cities meet these targets."8 The federal Government has&#13;
adopted regulations and introduced laws that would provide most of the legal basis for the reforms sought&#13;
at the local level. The reform packages are also designed so that many of the individual elements will&#13;
be at least partly sustainable and beneficial even if not all reforms objectives are met.&#13;
5.38           Another set of risks relates to the cost, performance, and price factors that could&#13;
compromise the financial and economic savings projected from the energy efficiency retrofits. Although&#13;
the project will use technologies that are proven in the West, they have not been implemented on a wide&#13;
scale in Russia. In addition, the pace of implementation could be constrained by a number of factors,&#13;
including delays in procurement and contracting.   To mitigate these risks, intensive technical,&#13;
institutional, and legal/regulatory background work have been carried out-with heavy use of local&#13;
expertise-during preparation, with a careful review of experience with similar measures in other FSU&#13;
countries. An experimental design phase is underway with PPF financing to test various technologies and&#13;
to evaluate potentially cost-effective local suppliers. This activity has been particularly useful in flagging&#13;
possible procurement and contracting issues which would be encountered in project implementation. An&#13;
aggressive effort will be mounted by the engineering advisory consultants during implementation to&#13;
18/    Although much of this TA will be provided by consultants, the project will also facilitate-through meetings, electronic&#13;
mail, and other forms-discussions among officials from different cities on how to implement the reforms. This cross-city&#13;
fertilization of ideas and strategies has proven to be very effective during project preparation.&#13;
&#13;

Chapter 5. Benefits and Risks                                                                             49&#13;
develop potential local supply sources, and training of local labor in participating cities will be done to&#13;
reduce installation and maintenance costs over time. One clear lesson from all of this preparatory work&#13;
has been to focus retrofits on large buildings, where the financial and economic returns are highest.&#13;
5.39            Tenant reaction to the retrofits is an additional concern. If tenants dislike, or fail to use&#13;
various retrofit measures properly, the returns to the project could be reduced. This risk is being&#13;
addressed in various ways. A social survey has been carried out to examine the demand for-and&#13;
knowledge about-different types of measures, issues related to perceptions of benefits (in both financial&#13;
terms and in terms of increased comfort), and likely usage habits. Tenant reactions to the PPF-financed&#13;
experimental design retrofits will be closely monitored via ex-ante and ex-post surveys, as well as other&#13;
social monitoring mechanisms. A general design mitigation strategy is to focus initially on "passive"&#13;

measures such as insulation and weather-stripping which require no interaction by tenants and "active"&#13;
measures outside the apartment such as building-level controls. Billing based on metering will be&#13;
introduced gradually, and only in conjunction with appropriate subsidiary measures (e.g., thermostatic&#13;
controls) that allow  tenants to control their usage.   A  top priority will be to ensure adequate&#13;
communications with tenants through various media, including newspapers, radio, meetings, and flyers.&#13;
5.40            To ensure that maximum possible benefits accrue under the project, procedures will be&#13;
put in place so that the design of the retrofit packages will be refined over time as technical and social&#13;
feedback is obtained, relative prices and regulations change, and new technologies are identified. The&#13;
project will also coordinate closely with the ESMAP initiative being directed by the World Bank's&#13;
Industry and Energy Department to determine longer-run strategies for optimizing investment decisions&#13;
related to district heating systems. While this rolling design process will continue throughout the life of&#13;

the project, a formal mid-term review will be held to assess the experience to date. This review will also&#13;
permit loan proceeds to be reallocated between cities based on implementation performance and evolving&#13;
creditworthiness indicators.&#13;
C. SUSTAINABILry&#13;
5.41          Russia's size and enormous needs during the transition mean that Bank financing should&#13;
generally be used to demonstrate the benefits of reforms and investments that can be duplicated around&#13;
the country without the Bank's assistance. The proposed project is designed to show that the policy and&#13;
institutional changes required as a condition of receiving Bank financing will make the housing divestiture&#13;
process more affordable and sustainable for all stakeholders, and will help lay the groundwork for a&#13;
private housing market. By selecting cities based on a demonstrated conmmitment to reform, the federal&#13;
Government has substantially increased the likelihood that the results will be sustainable. Although&#13;
desirable, in the future the required reforms and investments will not need to proceed at exactly the same&#13;
time, improving the prospects for sustainability if progress is not consistent across all areas. With respect&#13;
to the investments being supported under the project, experience around the world shows that once the&#13;
financial and economic gains from energy efficiency measures are demonstrated, financing can be&#13;
effectively arranged from a number of different public and private sources. Extensive analysis has been&#13;
carried out to ensure that the financial returns to cities and households will make such investments viable&#13;
for commercial financing in the medium term when the financial system is adequately developed.&#13;
5.42          In addition to demonstrating economic and financial gains from energy efficiency and&#13;
other investments, the project contributes to a sustainable process of utility cost reductions for other cities&#13;
in Russia by demonstrating institutionally how such investments can be made. In Russia, many&#13;
transaction barriers limit energy efficiency investments, and many of these barriers are related to the lack&#13;
of proper information, institutions, mechanisms, and policies, not simply the lack of capital. The&#13;
problem of energy efficiency for residential buildings is especially difficult institutionally. The project&#13;
provides an example of how to overcome many of these barriers, and the impacts of different types of&#13;
institutional changes. For examp!e, the project will illustrate institutional changes required for: (i)&#13;
consumption-based billing and payments for heat and hot water; (ii) contracting, tendering, and project&#13;
management and supervision of retrofits at a local level; (iii) heating company responsibility for&#13;
distribution losses; (iv) heat and hot water purchase contracts and agreements; (v) retrofit installation; and&#13;
(vi) technical performance monitoring and analysis.&#13;
5.43          The project will place special emphasis on the use of local expertise and equipment under&#13;
the project. This will also promote sustainability. While it is inevitable that the project will require&#13;
substantial foreign expertise and equipment, efforts are being made during preparation to work with local&#13;
suppliers to prepare them to bid and/or to encourage them to enter into joint ventures with foreign firms.&#13;
D. POVERTY IMPACT&#13;
5.44          The project supports a specific mechanism-a system of housing allowances-that&#13;
mitigates the impact on vulnerable households of higher energy and housing costs. Annex H presents&#13;
the broad guidelines for the housing allowance program. As shown in Annex R, 20 - 30 percent of&#13;
households might be eligible for housing allowances in the first years after achieving full cost recovery.&#13;
As a condition of selection for the project, participating cities were required to make such a means-tested&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 5. Benefits and Risks                                                            51&#13;
allowance system operational by hiring appropriate staff, establishing transparent eligibility criteria, and&#13;
publicizing the program through the local media. During project implementation, the project will monitor&#13;
and assist the capacity of local governments to run these programs as overall cost recovery levels increase&#13;
and the demand for housing allowances grows. The allowances will be financed from the budgetary&#13;
savings that accrue as a result of increased cost recovery from better-off households. The project will&#13;
thus accelerate the pace of fiscal reform and adjustment by requiring cities to replace largely regressive&#13;
general housing subsidies with well-targeted subsidies to the poor.&#13;
E. ENVIRONmENTAL BENEFITS&#13;
5.45          The project is expected to have a positive effect on the environment by reducing energy&#13;
use in the participating cities. Much of the heat and hot water produced on the margin during the winter&#13;
in several project cities is generated by burning mazut (heavy fuel oil) in extremely inefficient and&#13;
polluting heat-only boilers. In many cases, the efficiencies gained under the project will enable these&#13;
boilers to be shut down. The beneficial impacts of the project include reduced atmospheric emissions of&#13;
nitrogen-oxides (NOJ), sulfur-dioxide (SO2), and carbon-dioxide (CO2) from reduced consumption of&#13;
natural gas and mazut in district heating plants or combined heat-and-power plants. A preliminary&#13;
estimate for total annual emissions reductions of the full project when implemented is: 7,600 tons S02,&#13;
1600 tons NO1, and 950,000 tons CO2. Guidelines are being developed to ensure proper handling of any&#13;
hazardous substances while the buildings are under renovation (see Annex K). The project is classified&#13;
as category B.&#13;

VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
6.1          The following summarizes the agreements to be reached and the recommended actions&#13;
to be taken on the project.&#13;
6.2           During appraisal, the following agreements and clarifications were achieved with the&#13;
federal Government and cities.&#13;
(i)    Onlending terms and conditions to municipalities were clarified with the Ministry&#13;
of Finance, and a draft onlending agreement was prepared. (See paragraphs&#13;
3.18-3.19.)&#13;
(ii)    The reform status of the six selected cities was reviewed, and a final list of&#13;
participating cities was determined. An additional "reserve" city was included&#13;
in case one of the six cities drops out of the project and the reserve city can meet&#13;
the policy criteria. (See paragraph 3.2, and Annex P.)&#13;
(iii)   Details of USAID co-financing for parts of the TA component, with contingency&#13;
plans in the Bank loan if USAID were to face budgetary cuts during the project&#13;
implementation period were reviewed. (See paragraph 3.26, and Annex J.)&#13;
(iv)   Implementation details, including CPIU and LIG relationships, procurement&#13;
arrangements for the retrofits, and possible decentralization of functions over&#13;
time, were agreed upon. (See paragraphs 4.1-4.41, and Annex 0.)&#13;
(v)    The method of allocating funds and debt repayment obligations (including costs&#13;
of CPIU overhead and engineering services) between cities, as well as an initial&#13;
allocation of funds and procedures for possible future reallocations, was agreed.&#13;
Based on this, an initial phasing plan for roll out of the investments was&#13;
determined. (See paragraphs 3.8-3.16, 3.18-3.19.)&#13;
(vi)   The areas and scope of city commitments during project implementation with&#13;
respect to policy and institutional reform were elaborated, along with a&#13;
mechanism for reviewing progress annually during project implementation. It&#13;
was agreed that targets for policy and institutional reforms would be established&#13;
by the CPIU in agreement with the Bank on an annual basis. The relevant areas&#13;
will include, inter alia, progress with divestiture, cost recovery, competitive&#13;
bidding of maintenance, regulatory and fiscal treatment of condominium&#13;
associations. (See paragraphs 3.3, 4.43-4.46, Annex 7)&#13;
(vii)  Technical, policy, and institutional factors that drive the selection of buildings for&#13;
retrofits under the project were agreed. (See paragraph 3.17.)&#13;

ANNEX D&#13;
TEcHmNcAL ANALYsIS, DESIGN, AssumPTIoNs, AND INPUrS FOR RErRoFri&#13;
Overview&#13;
1.            Performance estimates of 40 retrofits and their associated installed unit costs were&#13;
combined with prototypical building types, representative climate types, and representative energy and&#13;
water costs to estimate an array of economic and financial parameters.&#13;
2.            Descriptions of the installed unit costs are available in the Project Files. An example of&#13;
the building stock database being used is shown in Table D-1. There are 15 basic building types which&#13;
break down into 29 building subtypes when differentiated based on the presence of an attic. These are&#13;
the building types being used with the implementation of the FEDS model. But in order to facilitate&#13;
spreadsheet analysis, these 29 building types were reduced to 10.&#13;
Prototype Buildings&#13;
3.            The 10 building types used in this analysis' are shown in Table D-2. These types comnprise&#13;
the full range of building stock, with one omission, in the EHDP cities. The typology differentiates&#13;
buildings according to the following parameters:&#13;
*             building height&#13;
*             building footprint&#13;
*             attic/no attic&#13;
*             bypass/no-bypass radiators&#13;
*             closed/open hot water&#13;
*             natural gas available&#13;
*             panel, brick, wood construction&#13;
4.            The "1-2 family' house category was excluded from evaluation as it represents less than&#13;
one percent of the total floor space and hence little opportunity for savings. In addition, this house type&#13;
cannot be analyzed in the same manner as the multi-family buildings as its thermal behavior is quite&#13;
different.&#13;
5.            The 10 prototypes shown in Table D-2 (excluding the 1-2 family houses) were used to&#13;
calculate the material and equipment requirements as shown in Tables D-3 and D-4. For example, the&#13;
building height and footprint determine the number of sections and aparutments, and thus, the number of&#13;
windows, radiators, doors, etc. Since the perimeter of the windows is known, so is the amount of&#13;
weather stripping required. Such logic is used to estimate the total material and equipment requrements&#13;
for every technical measure being considered, and these requirements are shown in Table D-3. The table&#13;
assumes a 100 percent penetration of each technical measure.&#13;
6.            Ideally, a table such as D3 would facilitate astimation of the total material and equipment&#13;
requirements of any city's building stock if one could assume  th  100 percent of the municipal and&#13;
enterprise-owned multi-family housing were retrofitted with each technical measure. In reaity, however,&#13;
I/    There will actually be 48 building typW used in the elaborated financialltechnical model used for design of retrofi&#13;
during inplementation. For simplicity's sake, these have been aggregated into 10 basic building types.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                           Staff Appraisal Report: Russia Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project&#13;
not all of the buildings will be retrofitted, and even those that were would not be retrofitted with all of&#13;
the retrofits being considered since some are mutuaily exclusive while others would not be cost-effective.&#13;
7.             But by assuming the total number of buildings retrofitted in a given city, the spreadsheet&#13;
can be to estimate aggregate installed cost, savings, and payback for a host of corollary assumptions and&#13;
to conduct sensitivity analyses.&#13;
8.             For this exercise, all buildings are categorized as one of three types: small, medium, and&#13;
large. The 2 to 4-story buildings are considered "small" buildings, the 5 to 8-story buildings are&#13;
"medium" buildings, and the 9 to 14-story buildings "large" buildings. This grouping is important as&#13;
physical characteristics are associated with different behavioral ones, which in turn yield different&#13;
financial returns for identical investment bundles. For examnple, natural draft ventilation controls is very&#13;
cost-effective in the "large" buildings but are not so in the "small" buildings.&#13;
Climate Types&#13;
9.             Results are reported for two different climate types: 4,750 versus 5,940 heating degree&#13;
days (HDD)2 (see Table D-5). These two climate types broadly cover the range of the 6 cities currently&#13;
active in the EHDP.&#13;
Value of Energy and Water Saved&#13;
10.            Heat Production Cost. All EHDP candidate cities subsidize district heat and hot water&#13;
services to their respective populations. In all cities, a district heating utility, which is considered a for-&#13;
profit city-owned company, plays a key role in producing and/or distributing the heat. The city&#13;
subsidizes this company to cover the agreed upon production and distribution costs.&#13;
11.            The stated heat production costs for those cities under consideration range from&#13;
approximately $10 per Gcal to $35 per Gcal. These costs change quarterly. Companies at the lower half&#13;
of this range primarily use natural gas and many purchase or produce co-generated heat. Companies at&#13;
the top of the range use residual fuel oil (mazut) in heat-only boilers.&#13;
12.            The ownership structure of heat energy producers and "resellers" is in flux. Examples&#13;
exist in which heat is resold up to 4 times in moving from producer to household. The companies that&#13;
produce and distribute the heat are structured, or are being structured, to operate as profit-oriented firms&#13;
with regulatory oversight from regional and city commissions. Reported production costs between&#13;
companies with seemingly similar physical production and distribution infrastructures - companies that&#13;
face near identical factor prices - may vary by as much as a factor. These significant inconsistencies are&#13;
actually similar to those observed in the U.S. electric power industry during the 1970's and early 1980's.&#13;
Inefficient management, especially in the number of employees, and "creative" accounting practices are&#13;
two likely reasons for such disparate reported heat production costs among various companies.&#13;
13.            Natural gas is currently being sold to the cities for $60 per 1000 nO3. Regional energy&#13;
commissions have been granted authority to regulate some gas prices but the commissions interviewed&#13;
by the technical team said that the gas price to energos and city heat companies is a nationally set price&#13;
and that is not expected to be lowered in the near future. Estimates of transportation costs of gas have&#13;
21     The heating degree days (HDD) for a Russian city is defined as (the target inside temperature minus the average&#13;
outside temperature during the heating season) x the number of days in the heating season.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D. Technical Analysis, Design, Assumptions, and Inputs for Retrofits                            3&#13;
been reviewed and range from $0.50 to $1.50 per 100 km per 1000 ni3. The technical team's estimate&#13;
is roughly $0.90 per 100 km per 1000 m3.3&#13;
14.            The price of natural gas used for the financial analysis will be $60 per 1000 m3. For the&#13;
economic analysis, costs based on border prices were not used because of existing physical constraints&#13;
on incremental exports.  Instead, economic costs were estimated using the long-run marginal cost&#13;
approach developed under the Gas Distribution Rehabilitation Project (IBRD Report No. 13046), which&#13;
would suggest an economic cost of gas for EHDP cities of $45 per 1000 m3. City heat companies have&#13;
been surveyed to determine the share of production costs attributable to natural gas. The share varies&#13;
from below 40 percent to over 70 percent with the majority of heat companies reporting close to 50&#13;
percent which is assumed for this analysis. Coupled with the assumption of a 70 percent operating&#13;
efficiency, the base values of delivered heat are $16.50/Gcal for the economic analysis and $19/Gcal for&#13;
the financial analysis.' This will understate the reported production costs for some cities, thus, this is&#13;
a conservative estimate.&#13;
15.            Electricity.  Traditionally, industry has subsidized residential consumers by paying&#13;
significantly higher rates; up to 6 times higher than residential rates. City companies do not generate&#13;
electricity. In about one-third of the EHDP cities, a city-owned company purchases electricity from a&#13;
regional energo and resells the electricity to either the ZHEO (which resells to the occupants) or directly&#13;
to the occupants. In these situations, the city needs to generate sufficient revenues through reselling to&#13;
cover the costs of electricity purchase and distribution. This is very similar to the construct of heat&#13;
companies purchasing and reselling hot water. The major difference is that cities do not need to subsidize&#13;
the city electric company as the company is able to collect enough revenues through industrial users to&#13;
cover all "production" costs. In these situations, the city would have a financial incentive to invest in&#13;
residential end-use efficiency measures only if the city electric company fell short in revenues and&#13;
required a city subsidy.&#13;
16.            Most cities have no involvement with the delivery of electricity to its occupants. The&#13;
relationship is strictly between the occupants and the regional energos. Nevertheless, the cities have an&#13;
incentive to promote investments in residential end-use efficiency measures, since local budget-financed&#13;
housing allowance programs will have to compensate poor households as overall utility costs rise.&#13;
17.            Recent changes in the electricity rate structure are likely to create more financial&#13;
incentives for some cities to invest in residential end-use efficiency. Industrial and residential rates are&#13;
being equalized, bringing rates closer to the "cost of service" by customer class. For purposes of this&#13;
analysis, a value of 4.5 cents/kWh is used.&#13;
18.            Cold Water. In contrast to that of heat and electricity, good data on the value of cold&#13;
water conservation is not available. Two reasons for this are 1) cities have not provided such data on a&#13;
timely basis and 2) the technical team has treated this issue as a lower priority. The data provided by&#13;
one city indicates that the production cost of cold water is about $0. 10/m3, though this figure does not&#13;
3/     Reported heat production costs have been analyzed for EHDP cities siuated near natural gas producing regions to&#13;
determine the change in heat production costs if credit were given in the gas pricing structure to the price of gas for a reduction&#13;
in transportation cost from the current $60 per 1000 m3 natural gas price. Assuming 1500 km transport at $0.90 per 100 km&#13;
per 1000 mi, tde gas price would be $46.50 per 1000 mn. Assuming an operating efficiency of 0.7, and 110 m3 of gas equal&#13;
to I Gcal at the burner tip, the value of gas saved at the building level would be $7.31 IGcal. Using the current price of gas,&#13;
$60 per 1000 m3, the value of gas saved at the building level would be $9.43/Gcal. If one were primarily interested in the value&#13;
to a city of gas saved, it is recommended that $9.43/Gcal be used.&#13;
4/     In fact for fmnancial analysis the value amounts to $22.801Gcal assuming 20 percent VAT.&#13;

include sewer services. Modem sewage treatment facilities typically contribute 80 to 100 percent of cold&#13;
water expenses. Though the combined water and sewer costs in Moscow are reported to be $0.54/m3,&#13;
this has not been confirmed. For purposes of this analysis, $0.20/r3 is the assumed basic value of saved&#13;
cold water and sewer services5, which is as low as a fifth of the cost of that in the U.S. when accounting&#13;
for all fixed costs. This value will be reviewed further.&#13;

*      Real escalation rate is 2.0 percent for natural gas&#13;
*      Heating degree days - 5,940 and 4,750&#13;
*      Technical measure life - 15 years&#13;
*      Ratio of Russian labor to Western labor is 5:1&#13;

ANNEX E&#13;
POTENTIAL RETROFfTS TO BE FINANCED&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.             The majority of the retrofits being considered for implementation under the project are&#13;
intended to reduce energy expenditures by saving energy.' Thirty-three out of the 40 retrofits are energy-&#13;
saving investments which fall into eight categories: insulation, weatherstripping, caulking, heating&#13;
controls, improvements in the water system, ventilation, envelope replacements, or improvements in the&#13;
electrical systems. This annex will summarize the characteristics of these retrofits.2&#13;
2.              Complications in Determining the Optimal Mix. Although there is sufficient information&#13;
on the cost-effectiveness of a given energy-saving retrofit by itself, measuring a retrofit's relative&#13;
performance in combination with other retrofits is extremely complex given that this data does not yet&#13;
exists for Russian multi-family buildings. Each retrofit is cost-effective under the appropriate conditions&#13;
depending on building type, climate, and utility cost structure; the optimal mix of retrofits, however,&#13;
varies from one building to another depending on a number of different factors. All retrofits would not&#13;
be implemented together in a single building or apartment as many of the retrofits are substitutes for each&#13;
other. Therefore, the retrofit costs (see Table D-4 for calculation methods) will be used in the Facility&#13;
Energy Decision System (FEDS) model, a general equilibrium model that measures detailed energy&#13;
consumption in buildings, to conduct a whole-building analysis of the building prototypes in the project&#13;
and thus to determine the optimal mix of investments for each prototype.3 The exact design of the&#13;
retrofits for Phase 11 of the project will be determined based on the experimental design work currently&#13;
under way in Ryazan (see Chapter 3, Box 3-1), which will be used to run the FEDS model. Experience&#13;
gained each year during Phase II will be incorporated into the design of the following years' retrofits as&#13;
well.&#13;
Characteristics of Energy-Saving Retrofits&#13;
3.              Active vs. Passive Retrofits. Eight of 31 building-level measures are "active" and 23 are&#13;
"passive." Active measures are defined as retrofits with moving parts. All other retrofits are defined&#13;
as passive. Insulation is an example of a passive measure. Examples of active measures are radiator&#13;
thermostatic controls, building level controls, and roof-top ventilation controls. Some active measures&#13;
give occupants more control over their environment. However, active measures typically have higher&#13;
maintenance requirements and, for some applications, the savings are more uncertain. For example,&#13;
/        Six retrofits are meter-installation retrofits, either on the building or apartment level, to introduce an energy billing&#13;
system based on actual energy consumption. The last 'retrofit' for consideration under the project is scaffolding, which is not&#13;
a retrofit, but which is needed to implement several retrofits.&#13;
V       The majority of the investments in the project will be retrofits within the boundary of the multi-family building; a small&#13;
amount of resources, however, will be reserved for retrofits that are outside the building's boundary and that decrease utility&#13;
costs.&#13;
3/       Because the FEDS is still under development, however, a preliminary analysis (see Table D-3) will serve as a&#13;
substitute until the FEDS is completed. This preliminary analysis was based on experience with whole-building analyses&#13;
conducted in the west and extensive studies of Russian multi-story apartment buildings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

would occupants use thermostatic radiator controls or would they continue to use the window to control&#13;
the temperature?&#13;
4.             Reduced Utility Costs vs. Reduced Distict Heating Costs. Thirty-one of the energy-&#13;
saving retrofits reduce utility costs within the buildings while three reduce costs in the district heating&#13;
system that serves the buildings. (One of these three, district hot water optimization, fall into both&#13;
categories). Twenty-two of the utility-saving measures directly affect space heating-the most important&#13;
and costly utility service-of which 14 affect the building envelope. The remaining utility-saving retrofits&#13;
affect either the heat delivery mechanism or the ventilation system.&#13;
Condusion&#13;
5.             The interaction among heat delivery, ventilation, hot water, and appliances within a&#13;
building system is complex and no detailed studies on Soviet-style buildings existed prior to EHDP&#13;
preparation work. To some degree, space heating measures are substitutes for hot water and household&#13;
appliance measures as households periodically use the gas range and/or filling the bath tub with hot water&#13;
for generating extra heat. In addition, motors of household appliances, as well lights, generate waste heat&#13;
which may contribute to total heating energy, and particularly in small spaces. Little information is&#13;
available on the relative contributions of these factors to total apartment and building heat loads for&#13;
Russian multi-family housing. This lack of information makes it difficult to determine ex-ante the&#13;
potential relative contribution from each utility-saving measure being considered. As stated earlier, there&#13;
is sufficient information on the contribution and performance of each measure by itself; i.e, as if it were&#13;
the first measure implemented. Furthermore, when retrofits are substitutes, one eliminates the need for&#13;
another, e.g., exterior insulation will likely mean that radiator reflectors will not be cost-effective.&#13;
6.             Given the results of whole building analyses in the west, and the current level of&#13;
knowledge of Russian multi-family buildings, reasonable combinations of retrofits can be designed for&#13;
the first cut at estimating the level of investment, savings, etc. When the results of the experimental&#13;
design work under way in Ryazan and the full configuration of the FEDS model are complete, whole&#13;
building analyses of prototypes will be conducted. Meanwhile, Table D-3 gives a preliminary analysis&#13;
of the equipment and materials needed for the prototypes.&#13;

ANNEX F&#13;
FiNANCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES OF RETROFIT INVESTMENTS&#13;
1.             This annex presents the results of financial, economic, and sensitivity analyses of&#13;
investments in building retrofits.' The financial and economic analyses are presented in a base case&#13;
scenario, and sensitivity analyses were conducted for heat price, total installed cost, labor cost, tax rates,&#13;
and the use of external insulation.&#13;
1. Financial and Economic Analysis: The Base Case Scenaro&#13;
2.      The financial analysis was conducted on the level of the city, while the economic analysis was&#13;
conducted on a national level. All values are expressed in real 1995 dollars.&#13;
Assumptions&#13;
3.              The following assumptions were used for the base case scenario:&#13;
a.     Discount Rate. A 10 percent real discount rate was used.&#13;
b.      Heating Degree Days (HDD..  5,940 HDD  was used as it is representative for all&#13;
project cities, except for Novocherkassk, which is slightly warrner than the other five&#13;
cities. (The sensitivity analysis takes into account an HDD of 4,750 as well as 5,940).&#13;
c.     Labor Input Ratio. The labor required for retrofit installations was assumed to be one&#13;
hour of Western labor for every five hours of Russian labor.&#13;
d.      No Wage Escaltion. No wage escalation was assumed for Russian labor. Due to the&#13;
considerable uncertainties concerning wage dynamics for Russian workers, a relatively&#13;
conservative or high average wage rate was used for the analysis-US$5.00 per hour.&#13;
(A sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for increases in Russian wage costs, see&#13;
Table F-8).&#13;
e.      Materials Multiplier.  The value of technology and equipment used in the financial&#13;
analysis was reduced by the materials multiplier of 15 percent to account for duties and&#13;
taxes in the economic analysis. The value of saved energy and water does not include&#13;
VAT.&#13;
I/      This analysis does not include the cost of building-level meters because it is difficult to estimate the savings that will&#13;
accrue to them. The addition of building-level meters adds 4 to 12 percent to the total investment requirements depending on&#13;
building type and reduces payback and the IRR by about the same percentages if no additional savings are attributed to metering.&#13;
With the inclusion of meter investments in medium-sized buildings, the IRR falls from 39.8 percent to 38.5 percent, and the&#13;
IRR from 32.4 percent to 31.3 percent.&#13;
2/      The HDD for a Russian city is defmed as (the target inside temperature minus the average outside temperature during&#13;
the heating season) times the number of days in the heating season.&#13;
&#13;

Results and Conclusions of the Base Case Scenario&#13;
5.            Financial Analysis. According to the base case scenario, the project will generate an&#13;
internal rate of return (IRR) between 40 to 55 percent and have a payback ranging between 1.9 to 2.7&#13;
years (see Table F-2).&#13;

Note: Investments in district heating systems are not shown in this table.&#13;
6.            Economic Analysis. The IRR ranges from 32 to 45 percent in this scenario, with a&#13;
payback of 2.3 to 3.3 years (see Table F-3).&#13;
From both a financial and economic point of view, large buildings are the best investment&#13;
targets.&#13;

II. Sensitivity Analyses&#13;
7.            Several sensitivity analyses are presented in this annex. The exogenous variables that&#13;
could have the greatest impact on the financial and economnic viability of the EHDP have been identified.&#13;
These are the:&#13;
a.     value of heat energy saved (cost of district heat), and&#13;
b.     total installed cost of the technical measures.&#13;
Financial and economic switching value analyses are conducted for these two variables.&#13;
8.            Furthermore, financial sensitivity analyses are conducted for four additional variables of&#13;
interest; Russian labor costs, Western labor costs, tax rates and exterior insulation.&#13;
Heat Price - Switching Value Analysis&#13;
9.            The switching value analysis for district heat prices is presented for both the financial and&#13;
economic analyses.&#13;
10.           Financial Analysis. The switching value analysis is shown in Table F4.  An IRR&#13;
analysis is conducted for small, medium, and large buildings for 4,750 and 5,940 HDD . Because the&#13;
discount rate being used is 10 percent, an IRR of 10 percent is the point where the net present value of&#13;
the project falls to zero. The starting value for the heat price is $22.80/Gcal, which is the base price used&#13;
in the financial analysis.&#13;
11.           In Table F-4, movement is in the right direction and there are no surprises. The heat&#13;
price where the IRR falls below 10 is shown in bold. The heat price would have to fall more than 75&#13;
percent (from $22.80/Gcal to $5/Gcal) before the project would become inviable from a financial&#13;
perspective. Project risk can be minimized by focusing on relatively cold cities with large buildings or&#13;
large buildings within any city.&#13;

12.            Finally, it is important to note that at $60/1000 m3 for natural gas, the value of natural&#13;
gas embedded in the delivered heat is $9.43/Gcal, which is nearly 50 percent above the price to which&#13;
district heat would need to fall to render the project financial inviable.&#13;
13.            Table F-4 does not include the cost of building-level billing meters because quantitative&#13;
estinates of savings resulting from meter installation have been used in this analysis. The inclusion of&#13;
building-level meters, assuming no attributable savings, would have no significant impact on the IRR.&#13;
For example, for large buildings, the heat price at which the IRR falls below 10 remains unchanged.&#13;
14.            Economic Analysis. The economic switching value analysis for heat price is shown in&#13;
Table F-5. The starting price used for heat is $16.50/Gcal which is the base price used in the economnic&#13;
analysis. All general conclusions drawn from the financial analysis pertain to the economic analysis.&#13;
The only difference is the heat price at which the IRR falls below ten. These values are shown in bold.&#13;
The heat price would need to fall by over 75 percent for the project IRR to drop below 10.&#13;

Installed Cost - Switching Value Analysis&#13;
15.            The switching value analysis for total installed cost is presented for both the financial and&#13;
economic analyses.&#13;
16.            Financial Analysis. The switching value analysis is shown in Table F-6. The analysis&#13;
is conducted for small, medium, and large buildings for 4,750 and 5,940 heating degree days (HDD).&#13;
Installed costs of the energy and water efficiency measures are relatively uncertain. There has been no&#13;
project of this magnitude undertaken and, therefore, no experience base to judge installed cost under a&#13;
prolonged, high volume, program. The base costs assume a mix of five Russian labor hours to one&#13;
Western labor hour and all material and equipment purchased at Western prices. Therefore, the base&#13;
costs are reasonably conservative. The points at which the IRR falls below 10 are shown in bold.&#13;

17.    Table F-6 indicates that the total installed costs would need to increase by a factor of 3.5 before&#13;
the project would become financial inviable. Because the installed cost base values are conservative&#13;
estimates, this seems unlikely. Even then, large buildings would still be attractive.&#13;
18.    As with the heat price analysis, building-level billing meters are not included in these estimates.&#13;
The addition of meters would have minimal impact on the IRR. For example, at a multiplier of 2.50,&#13;
5,940 HDD, and medium-size buildings, inclusion of meters would cause the IRR to drop from 14.8&#13;
percent to 14.1 percent. This change is less than 0.7 percent IRR, or about 5 percent of 14.8.&#13;
19.    Table F-6a shows that the tax rate would need to increase 28 fold (from 17.65 percent to 500&#13;
percent) before the financial viability of the EHDP would be threatened. The tax rate could increase 17&#13;
fold and the IRR for all buildings would still be greater than 10 percent. (The 17.65 percent tax rate is&#13;
implied with the .85 materials multiplier.)&#13;

20.    Economic Analysis. The economic switching value analysis is shown in Table F-7. The base&#13;
installed costs are adjusted by lowering the materials component of each measure by 15 percent to account&#13;
for taxes and duties. All general conclusions drawn from the financial analysis pertain to the economic&#13;
analysis. The only difference is the total installed cost multiplier at which the IRR falls below 10.&#13;

Summary - Switching Value Analysis&#13;
23.            The switching value analysis for the price of district heat and total installed measure cost&#13;
indicates that dramatic changes from the base case inputs would need to occur for the project to become&#13;
inviable. Furthermore, in all cases, it is clear that in the face of uncertainty, project risk will be&#13;
minimized by focusing on large- and medium-size buildings first, in cities with the coldest climates.&#13;
24.            Sensitivity to Labor Cost Changes.  There are two components of labor costs that&#13;
warranted evaluation. First, Russian wage rates are expected to increase at a relatively rapid rate over&#13;
the life the EHDP. The Russian labor component in the base case is at a ratio of five to one compared&#13;
with Western labor. It is important to know how significant changes in Russian wage rates will affect&#13;
the financial viability of the EHDP. This is shown in Table F-8.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                           Staff Appraisal Report: Russia Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project&#13;
25.            Table F-8 indicates that Russian wage rates could increase by a factor of 5 and have no&#13;
significant impact on the financial viability of the EHDP.&#13;
26.            Although comprising only 20 percent of the labor hour contribution, Western labor&#13;
accounts for a greater portion of the total projected labor bill than does Russian labor. An analysis was&#13;
conducted to determine the sensitivity to the project from dramatic increases in Western labor costs and&#13;
to compare this to the impact from increased Russian labor costs. It was found that a 50 percent increase&#13;
in Russian labor costs would increase total installed cost by 6 percent whereas a 50 percent increase in&#13;
Western labor costs would increase project costs by 12 percent.&#13;
27.            An important conclusion is that the EHDP cannot be successful without a sizeable&#13;
component of Russian labor.&#13;

28.            Sensitivity to Use of External Insulaton.  The inclusion or exclusion of external&#13;
insulation can significantly impact the total project cost estimates because it is the highest single cost&#13;
technical measure per building. The product identified and evaluated by the technical team is&#13;
polyurethane foam as it appears to be the cost-effective external insulation option. Foam is, typically,&#13;
not used in the West as external insulation because buildings are well insulated when constructed so there&#13;
is no need for external insulation. Also, in the few situations where external insulation is needed, there&#13;
are more aesthetically pleasing products which are, also, less ultraviolet sensitive. However, these other&#13;
products are also significantly more expensive and less cost-effective than foam. There is documented&#13;
evidence of buildings in North America which have had foam applied to the exterior as insulation.&#13;
Examples are found in Montana and in Toronto with reported satisfactory results regarding insulating&#13;
performance and durability of the foam. In Russia, there is, also, some experience with using foam as&#13;
exterior insulation. One 13 story multi-family building has been found in Vladimir which had foam&#13;
applied to the exterior in 1989. The results have been positive and are similar to the North American&#13;
experience in terms of insulating performance and durability. Furthermore, the city is enthusiastic&#13;
regarding further use of foam as exterior insulation. Additional technical evaluation needs to be&#13;
completed as well as to verify the working hypothesis that the market will be able to supply the product&#13;
in mass quantities at the costs used in this analysis. Because of these reasons, a financial sensitivity&#13;
analysis was conducted assuming no external insulation is used as a retrofit option. The analysis&#13;
compares the optimally estimated retrofit package to the same package minus external insulation.&#13;
29.            As expected, retrofit costs per building fell significantly; dropping 47 percent for large&#13;
buildings, 30 percent for medium buildings, and 29 percent for small buildings. The IRR increased&#13;
because external insulation does not payback the investment as rapid as other measures. For medium-size&#13;
buildings in cold cities, for example, the IRR increased from 39.8 percent to 45.4 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX G&#13;
FINANCIAL IMACT ON CITIES AND CREDITWORTHINESS&#13;
1.              Spending by regional budgets has increased from  12 percent of GDP in 1992 to 17&#13;
percent of GDP in 1994 in Russia (despite increasingly limited resources for the consolidated government&#13;
budget) as fiscal responsibilities of municipal authorities have expanded. However, because of an&#13;
underdeveloped financial infrastructure, municipal authorities in Russia have as yet very limited access&#13;
to long-term borrowing, and thus their long-term debt outstanding is insignificant.&#13;
2.               Rapid growth of local budget expenditures on housing is the most critical threat to&#13;
sustainable development of municipal finance. For instance, in Petrozavodsk the total subsidies for&#13;
supporting the existing housing stock increased from 5 percent of the total budget expenditures in 1990&#13;
to 24 percent in 1992-93.' A corresponding decline in new budget investments, from 32 to 6 percent,&#13;
occurred as a direct consequence of the housing subsidy increase, and this clearly hinders further urban&#13;
development.&#13;
3.              On average, for the six cities selected for the project, the total explicit budget liabilities&#13;
for housing subsidies amounted to about 30 percent of their 1994 budgets.2 (see Table G-1) Taking&#13;
current trends in energy prices and forthcoming completion of enterprise housing divestiture into account,3&#13;
it might be expected that without strong policy response on cost recovery the demand for housing that&#13;
subsidies might reach 50 percent of available budget funds after 1995. While real local budgets are&#13;
expected to grow further-by 15-20 percent by 2000 compared to 1994 levels-under such a scenario&#13;
housing expenditures would remain unacceptably high.&#13;
4.              Therefore, both investments to reduce housing costs and reforms in the housing sector,&#13;
which would encourage efficiency growth within the sector, are crucial for municipal finance. Without&#13;
comprehensive housing reform there is no way to improve the budget situation or to secure medium-term&#13;
creditworthiness of municipal budgets.  Therefore, from  the point of view  of external lenders,&#13;
transformations within the urban housing sector in Russia are not only a priority for long-term lending&#13;
but also an important condition for proper debt repayment and avoiding defaults by municipal borrowers.&#13;
1/     In 1994, housing spending in Petrozavodsk fell to 17.5 percent due to some increase in real rent paid by residents and&#13;
also because of accumulation of arrears to local utlity companies. The latter is sdill possible in Russia as a result of extremely&#13;
opaque legal environment.&#13;
2/      Total liabilities include both actual expenditures on housing and accumuladon of budget arrears to housing maintenance&#13;
and utility companies. This does not account for the volume of underfinancing, i.e. it does not reflect the fact that total liabilities&#13;
are still below the amount of funds necessary for proper housing maintenance.&#13;
3/     In 1994, on average, about 30 percent of the total housing stock in cities in question was maintained by enterprises,&#13;
and this amount had fell sharply during 1995 as a part of the project preparation (See Annex P).&#13;

5.            The project will reduce local budget expenditures on housing via the following:&#13;
a.     Increase in Cost Recovery. Under the project, the cities are responsible for achieving&#13;
full cost recovery in housing maintenance and utilities in 1998 and for simultaneously&#13;
developing the housing allowance program for poor residents. This dramatic growth in&#13;
cost recovery from an average of less than 15 percent in 1994 will be a major source of&#13;
savings for the local budgets. An analysis of affordibility of an increase in housing&#13;
tariffs shows that households will be able to cover from their own incomes about 80&#13;
percent of the total housing costs under full cost recovery (see Annex R).4&#13;
b.     Investments in Energy Efficiency.  The proposed types of investments in housing&#13;
improvements will potentially save about one-third of the current volume of utility&#13;
services in heating and hot water supply. Because two-thirds of the total municipal&#13;
housing expenditures are spent on utility bills, appropriate investments might result in up&#13;
to 22 percent in savings of total housing expenditures, which will be equivalent to more&#13;
than 10 percent of total municipal budget outlays in the without-project scenario.5&#13;
4/     Tuis is consistent with the requirenent that the household expenditures on housing will have to be below 20 percent&#13;
of family income.&#13;
5/     As noted above, the without-project scenario assumes that housing subsidies will rise to 50 percent of local budget&#13;
revenues.&#13;

c.     Seting New Incentives within the Housing Sector. A number of policy and technical&#13;
measures envisaged under the project are aimed at changing the incentive structure for&#13;
economic agents in the sector. These measures will help to improve overall economic&#13;
efficiency of the sector and to gain additional budget savings in maintenance. First,&#13;
increased cost recovery will be a major incentive for households to avoid wasting energy.&#13;
Second, the creation of condominiums and the formation of competitive markets for&#13;
maintenance will provide an institutional framework for households to pressure providers&#13;
of housing services to reduce costs. Third, installation of meters will help both the&#13;
residents and municipalities to monitor actual delivery and use of utility services and&#13;
therefore to fully benefit from reduced energy and utility consumption.&#13;
6.            As a whole, it is expected that in five years the share of housing expenditures in city&#13;
budgets might be reduced to 10 percent (from their existing level of 30 percent) and projected without-&#13;
project level of 50 percent of the total budget expenditures as a result of comprehensive housing policy&#13;
supported by necessary investments. The remaining housing expenditures will consist mainly of housing&#13;
allowances and to some extent from budget grants for capital repair of housing and infrastructure assets.&#13;
The budget savings will be available for new investments in city infrastructure and public services as well&#13;
as servicing accumulated municipal debt. Therefore reform efforts and investments supported by the&#13;
project provide rather substantial payback that will provide the necessary cash flow for cities to repay&#13;
their loans under the project. (Cities will also recover part of the costs from special changes to tenants&#13;
who benefit from the retrofits.)&#13;
7.            Analysis of city creditworthiness has been done under assumptions derived from the&#13;
Bank's medium-term macroeconomic forecast for Russia, which assumes successful macroeconomic&#13;
stabilization.6 In general, the considered scenario presents quite optimistic while reasonable prospects&#13;
for Russian municipal finance development. The following assumptions are the most important for the&#13;
purposes of the analysis under the chosen scenario:&#13;
a.    In the next five years from 1995 to 1999, Russian municipal budget revenues will remain&#13;
at the same level as a portion of GDP while the volume of real GDP will increase by 16&#13;
percent.&#13;
b.     The ruble will continue to appreciate and reach its PPP level by the end of the century.&#13;
This will lead to an increase in the real exchange rate of 65 percent and will dramatically&#13;
increase the hard currency equivalent of corresponding budget revenues.&#13;
c.     As mentioned above, the cities might increase operating budget surplus by 10-15 percent&#13;
of their total revenues as a result of positive developments within the housing sector.7&#13;
d.     Cities' access to domestic borrowing will remain very restricted, which will keep the&#13;
municipal debt levels low.&#13;
§/     See 1995 Russian CEM (Russian Federation: Towards Medium-Term Viability, World Bank Report No. 14472-RU).&#13;
7/     All other revenue and expenditure items are considered unchanged.&#13;

8.             Table G-2 presents the main city budget characteristics based on the following scenario.&#13;
It is assumed that under the project the cities will borrow at 9 percent interest for 14 years with a 6-year&#13;
grace period and 5-year disbursement schedule.8 This financing schedule results in an average annual&#13;
debt service, during the amortization period, equal to 17.6 percent of the loan principal amount (Table&#13;
G-3). $290 million of the loan will be allocated to cities taking into account variation in the current fiscal&#13;
situation across them. The total revenues, budget investments, budget arrears, and the role of intra-&#13;
governmental transfers in revenues of municipal budgets were taken into consideration. As an external&#13;
constraint for the proposed financial program, it was assumed that the volume of the funds lent to each&#13;
of the cities should not be greater than 50 percent of the estimated total budget revenues of these cities.&#13;
9.             While Table G-2 shows some variation in debt service coefficients across the cities,&#13;
overall, the proposed lending plan is considered to be sustainable. The data prove that the proposed&#13;
operation is quite feasible in a wide macroeconomic framework. In particular, the average annual debt&#13;
service would amount to about 5.5-9.0 percent of the municipal budget revenues if the cities bear the full&#13;
responsibility for the loan. If tenants repay 70 percent of the loan themselves, than the net debt burden&#13;
for cities amounts to 2-3 percent of the budget revenues.9 Average debt service coverage (DSCR)'° would&#13;
be 2.0 with individual DSCR falling in the range of 1.8-2.3. The value of the loan per capita would&#13;
amount to $147.&#13;
10.            To evaluate sensitivity of the proposed financial program, alternative calculations of&#13;
DSCR were conducted. The calculations correspond to a possibility of a much slower implementation&#13;
of housing reforms, which would lead to continued high budgetary spending on housing, of about 20&#13;
percent of the total budget revenues instead of 10 percent as it is assumed in the basic scenario. Higher&#13;
housing expenditures will reduce the estimated budget surplus by one-half. This might reduce the average&#13;
DSCR from 2.0 to 1.5, which is still a very reasonable level, indicating high capability of municipalities&#13;
to serve their debt obligations.&#13;
11.            However, to reflect general macroeconomic uncertainty which has been recently a&#13;
dominating feature of Russia's transition to a market economy, it is proposed to incorporate into the&#13;
financial program under the project a requirement to revise the municipal budget situation and fiscal&#13;
trends in the cities within three years of loan effectiveness. Should budget situations at the time be&#13;
unfavorable. reductions in the subloan amounts described in Table G-2 might be made.&#13;
8/     Nine percent is a conservative assumption that provides for the possibility of future LIBOR increases. At current&#13;
LMOR levels. the onlending rate will be 8.0-8.5 percent.&#13;
9/     This assumes that the cities will assume repayment responsibility for the engineering and procurement groups.&#13;
10/    DSCR is estimated as a ratio of operating savings before interest to the average debt service.&#13;

ANNEX H&#13;
COST RECOVERY AND HOUSING ALLOWANCES&#13;
1.             The Soviet Legacy. The housing sector was a traditional recipient of budget subsidies&#13;
in the FSU with rent levels set below maintenance costs, direct budget investment grants allocated to local&#13;
utility companies, and cross-subsidization of energy tariffs for households provided through higher prices&#13;
for industrial consumers. It is estimated that in 1991 households spent on housing only 2 percent of their&#13;
total consumer expenditures. After price liberalization in 1992, rent and the main utility tariffs remained&#13;
under federal government control, and price adjustment in the sector has been going on the basis of&#13;
periodic administrative price revisions. As a result, in 1992-93 the rise in prices within the sector lagged&#13;
well behind overall price increases (Table H-1, H-2; Figure H-1).   Later in  1993, municipal&#13;
administrations obtained the right to set rents, as well as local tariffs for heating, sewage, water supply,&#13;
etc.' at their own discretion. However, this did not change the main trends in the sector. Despite some&#13;
growth in real costs, real total household expenditures on housing fell by a factor of 3 by end 1993&#13;
relative to their 1991 level (Table H-3). In particular, payments for housing maintenance were in real&#13;
terms less than 10 percent of the pre-reform level. The level of cost recovery in housing fell below 5&#13;
percent in the middle of 1993 (Tables H-2 and H-4)2, while the share of housing expenditures in the total&#13;
consumer expenditures reached its lowest level of 0.5 percent.&#13;
2.             Initiatves to Increase Cost Recovery. In 1994 the federal government launched a number&#13;
of initiatives targeted at an increase in cost recovery (see Table H-5). In particular, the local authorities&#13;
were directed to reach full cost recovery in the sector (excluding capital repair costs) by 1998. In&#13;
addition, federally controlled prices of natural gas, both for households and housing organizations, were&#13;
substantially increased. This pushed local governments to increase utility tariffs further, and led to a&#13;
substantial price adjustment in the sector in the course of 1994. It is estimated that the overall cost&#13;
recovery level reached 11-12 percent for 1994 as a whole, with additional tariff increases at the end of&#13;
the year. In fall of 1994 real household expenditures on housing rose to their 1991 level, and in early&#13;
1995 they exceeded this level by far, especially in reform oriented municipalities (Tables H-i - H-3).&#13;
The hard-currency equivalent of these costs has increased dramatically, reflecting the substantial ruble&#13;
appreciation in real terns, which began in early 1992: the total monthly costs of a 3-room apartment in&#13;
Petrozavodsk increased from less than 10 cents in late 1991 to above $35 in July 1995.&#13;
3.             Cost Recovery under EHDP. An accelerated schedule for increasing cost recovery was&#13;
among major criteria for city selection (see Annex P) under EHDP. Cost recovery had to reach at least&#13;
30 percent by July 1, 1995, and 40 percent by end 1995, while it had been 20 percent in most&#13;
participating cities at the end of 1994. All selected cities managed to fulfill the first requirement on time.&#13;
1/     Government resolutions No. 935 of 9/22/93 and No. 239 of 3/7/95. In addition, according to the Law on State&#13;
Regulation of Tariffs on Electricity and Heat of 4/14/95, regulatory power over tariffs on heat provided by regionally and&#13;
federally owned energy companies has been transferred from municipal administrations to specially created regional energy&#13;
commissions, which also are responsible for setting energy tariffs.&#13;
2/     Cost recovery ratios in 1992 and in early 1993 were relatively high because of extremely low administrated prices for&#13;
fuel, especially for gas.&#13;

4.             Housing Alowance Program. Local authorities were mnandated to institute a targeted&#13;
housing allowance scheme to protect vulnerable households. It was required that households with housing&#13;
expenditures exceeding 15 percent of their money income' would be eligible for receiving such&#13;
allowances. Only expenditures on housing that met locally approved social norms for housing would be&#13;
compensated through the allowances. Many cities, including all those involved in EHDP,4 have set up&#13;
more or less workable mechanisms for disbursing allowances, and these mechanisms include both formal&#13;
indicators of eligibility as well as testing of applicant's income statements. However, in most cases there&#13;
had been a limited number of actual recipients of the allowances by mid-1995, since even with the higher&#13;
charges, housing costs remained on average about 5 percent of household money incomes, compared with&#13;
20-25 percent in market economies. In addition, the average size of allowances disbursed was still rather&#13;
small.'&#13;
5.             Impact of Increased Cost Recovery on Household Income. Achieving full cost recovery&#13;
without any housing allowances in place would raise the average share of household income spent on&#13;
apartments to about 13 percent. Taking into account current patterns of income distribution in Russia,&#13;
this might lead to a situation where more than 40 percent of households face housing expenditures&#13;
exceeding 20 percent limit on such costs, and become recipients of housing allowances. The estimates&#13;
show (Annex R) that under the current legislation, the household sector as a whole might afford to pay&#13;
about 80 percent of actual housing costs, or 6.5 percent of GDP. This is equivalent to 10 percent of total&#13;
household income and 15 percent of total consumer expenditures. The rest of the costs, 1.5 percent of&#13;
GDP, will have to be covered by local budgets through the allowance scheme. Any further reduction in&#13;
such subsidies will require both an overall increase in the average real wage in the context of economic&#13;
recovery as well as reduction in real housing costs.&#13;
2/     This share might be as high as 20 percent beginning 1998.&#13;
I/     Setting up effective allowances schemes was one of the city selection criteria used under the project (see Annex P).&#13;
Sl     For instance, in Novocherkassk in spring of 1995, about 2.5 percent of families became recipients, and their average&#13;
allowance was less than 20 percent of minimal wage.&#13;

Note: Cost recovery ratios for 1992-93 appear high because of extremel low administered pricesforfueL&#13;
6.            Problems with Enforceability and Exemptions. Other challenges related to increasing&#13;
cost recovery are enforcement and preferential tariffs. If households refuse to pay their housing bills,&#13;
they are not easily evicted. About 15 percent of families in Russian cities pay for their housing with at&#13;
least a three-month delays. In addition, a number of social groups in Russia benefit from preferential rent&#13;
and utility payments. Such benefits, amounting currently to 15 percent of the total housing payments due,&#13;
have been as a rule inherited from FSU legislation, and are based on national regulations that cannot be&#13;
changed by local administrations. To address both of these problems, municipal authorities need support&#13;
from the federal level in revising relevant federal regulations, which currently prevent them from taking&#13;
more active intervention in this field.&#13;
7.            Need to Improve Monitoring and Administrave Capacity. To make full cost recovery&#13;
sustainable, and to get adequate financing for the housing allowance program, local governments have&#13;
to improve their monitoring and administrative capacity with respect to housing sector development.&#13;
This includes:&#13;
a.     improving control over the actual volume and quality of services provided by the local&#13;
utilities;&#13;
b.     developing mechanisms for regulation of utilities' prices. In case of electricity and heat&#13;
tariffs, this will require establishing effective interaction between municipal governments&#13;
and regional energy commissions;&#13;
c.     developing the system of monitoring actual housing payments by households, and to&#13;
impose penalties for non-payments;&#13;
d.     for a transitional period, until the end of housing divestiture, improving accounting of&#13;
actual enterprises' spending on housing and delivery of utility services, and to link this&#13;
with necessary changes in local regulation of the turnover tax in order to make associated&#13;
financial burden more evenly distributed across the enterprise sector.&#13;

ANNEX I&#13;
STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS&#13;
The institutional structure of stakeholders in the current situation is shown in Figure I-1.&#13;
The stakeholders in Figure I-1 will be relevant in all situations with the exception of the regional electric&#13;
power utility (energo) and the regional energy commission. The energo and the regional energy&#13;
commission will be important stakeholders only if the city purchases heat from the energo (which is the&#13;
case for Vladimnir, Ryazan, Petrozavodsk, and Orenburg) or if end-use electricity efficiency improvements&#13;
are included under the project and electricity demand for the energo is affected.&#13;
2.           The following organizations have a stake in project cost, benefits, and outcom:&#13;
a.    City Government. The city government is interested in reducing its expenditures on&#13;
housing maintenance and operation, both through reduced true costs and through greater&#13;
cost-recovery of those costs from residents. The city government provides the subsidies&#13;
to housing maintenance enterprise necessary to pay for the difference in utility costs and&#13;
payments from residents. The city government's stake in the project is primary, as the&#13;
loan recipient, beneficiary, and responsible repayment agent.&#13;
b.    Muncpl Housng Mainennce Enterprises.   Municipal housing maintenane&#13;
enterprises are responsible for maintaining and operating city-owned buildings, and in&#13;
most cases are responsible for collecting utility payments from residents, for collecting&#13;
subsidies from the city governnent, and for paying utility suppliers (heat, hot water,&#13;
electricity, cold water, etc.) their full tariffs (representing true production costs).&#13;
Exceptions exist where residents pay electricity bills directly to electricity suppliers&#13;
(either the energo or a city distribution company) or to cold-water sewage enterprises.&#13;
Municipal housing maintenance enterprises will be concerned about the maintainability&#13;
of renovation measures, and will need to be trained to understand these measures and&#13;
how to maintain new equipment.&#13;
C.    Muncpa Water/Sewage Enterprise and Mwdcipl Heat Enteprise. These enterprises&#13;
are stakeholders in that demand for their products will be reduead by the project. Thus&#13;
the project will affect their future capacity planning, and their cost and profit structures&#13;
in terms of fixed versus variable costs and associated profit mnargins. Operational&#13;
changes in district heating and water supply systems may be necessary to accommodate&#13;
the reduced demand. Contractual changes with the city government may be necessary&#13;
so that heat sales and purchases will be based upon actual consumption rather than design&#13;
nonrs. Depeading upon other sources of demand, these enterprises may be able to sell&#13;
any excess capacity and heat production to their customers, minimizing some of the&#13;
above changes.&#13;
d.    Munipal Heat and Hot Water Distribudon Enterprise. In most case the functions of&#13;
heat and hot water distribution are performed by the same municipal heat enterprises that&#13;
produces heat and/or purchases heat from the energo. If this is a separate enterprise,&#13;
then this enterprise will be affected if distribution tariffs become based upon metered&#13;
quantities of heat rather than fixed charges based upon design norms. The distribution&#13;
costs (as distinct from heat production costs) to this enterprises probably won't change&#13;
very significantly as a result of the project, but its revenue structure may change.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                         Staff Appraisal Report: Russia Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project&#13;
e.     Residents in Renovated Buildings. Residents are interested in low utility bills, indoor&#13;
apartment comfort, responsive housing maintenance companies, and uninterrupted&#13;
supplies of utilities, and will be affected under the project by changes in all of these areas&#13;
(primarily positive changes; see section on incentives below). Residents may be resistant&#13;
to other kinds of changes unless they clearly perceive direct benefits to themselves. For&#13;
example, future heat billing based upon actual consumption rather than floor-space norms&#13;
may be actively resisted unless there are clear and direct financial benefits.&#13;
f.     Residents in Unrenovated Buildings. All residents in the city are stakeholders to the&#13;
degree that tariffs for utilities are reduced by the city (relative to a no-project scenario).&#13;
All residents are also stakeholders to the degree that improved city government financial&#13;
conditions have a positive influence on the city's ability to provide public services.&#13;
Nevertheless, residents in unrenovated buildings may perceive themselves as stakeholders&#13;
in the project for costs only and not benefits if they believe that their utility costs are&#13;
rising to pay for investments in other buildings in which they do not share in the benefits.&#13;
These perceptions may be exacerbated by cost-recovery-driven tariff increases enacted&#13;
before or at the same times as the loan repayment obligations begin. Thus public&#13;
education and outreach, directed not only at residents in renovated buildings, but also at&#13;
residents in unrenovated buildings, will be critical.&#13;
g.     Regional Combined-Heat-and-Power Plant. These plants are owned by a combination&#13;
of the regional electric power utility (energo), and/or the national electric power utility&#13;
RAO "EES Rossii." Under the project, their sales of heat to the city may be reduced (if&#13;
not all demand reductions are met from supply reductions in city-owned heating boilers),&#13;
and this will affect their future capacity planning, their cost and profit structure (in terms&#13;
of fixed versus variable costs) for both heat and electricity production.&#13;
h.     Regional Energy Commission. Regional energy commissions have a stake in the project&#13;
to the extent that regional energos and combined heat and power plants are affected by&#13;
the project. Prior to 1995, regional energy commissions were not legal entities, and thus&#13;
had no budgets or staff. Without resources, the commissions were weak and influenced&#13;
strongly by their chairmen, who often were representatives from the very energy utilities&#13;
the commissions are charged with regulating.  A  1995 law  gave these energy&#13;
commissions legal status, meaning that they can have a budget and hire staff. But it is&#13;
not yet clear where money will come from to pay for the commissions. Thus regional&#13;
energy commissions have the potential to become more autonomous from the oblast&#13;
administrations, but this question depends partly upon sources of financing and whether&#13;
the commissions can now become stronger and develop their regulatory capabilities,&#13;
experience and resources. In the past, the primary function of regional commissions has&#13;
been to approve tariffs for the regional energo, but greater regulatory authority will be&#13;
possible in the future. The role of the federal energy commission in the operation of the&#13;
regional commissions has been minimal, except for some guidance, training, or&#13;
coordination assistance.&#13;
i.     Regional (Oblast) Government. The regional government receives tax payments from&#13;
enterprises within the region, and will benefit from the increased profitability of these&#13;
enterprise when the liabilities of social assets are removed. The regional government&#13;
must guarantee the loan to the city government, thus it has a direct stake in project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1. Stakeholder Analysis                                                              3&#13;
performance and city government financial strength.&#13;
j.     Federal Government.   The Russian government is ultimnately responsible for loan&#13;
repayment, and thus has a stake in project performance and city government financial&#13;
strength. The Russian government will benefit from increased taxes and duties from&#13;
importation of equipment from abroad and from the increased economic activity&#13;
associated with project implementation.&#13;
3.            The following organizations are secondary stakeholders who may need to be included in&#13;
project implementation and procurement designs and strategies:&#13;
a.     Municipal Housing Maintenance Enterprises. With their detailed knowledge of the city&#13;
building stock, municipal housing maintenance enterprises will play a key role supporting&#13;
sub-contractors audit buildings, design renovations, and install equipment and materials.&#13;
One challenge for project implementation will be to create incentives and strategies for&#13;
municipal housing maintenance enterprises to support sub-contractors in an effective and&#13;
accountable manner.&#13;
b.     Municipal Design Instiues. Municipal design institutes have traditionally provided&#13;
engineering and design for municipal construction projects, and may have expertise about&#13;
the housing stock, about local codes and standards, and in other areas that will be useful&#13;
during project implementation. Like the case with municipal housing maintenance&#13;
enterprises, explicit strategies will be needed for including these institutes in project&#13;
implementation if appropriate.&#13;
4.           Incentives to stakeholders for participation in the project are clear in some cases and need&#13;
further definition in others. Residents and municipal governments will clearly see their total expenditures&#13;
on utilities decrease relative to a no-project scenario (although absolute payments by resident will increase&#13;
due to increase cost-recovery). The splitting of project benefits between the city and the residents will&#13;
be a policy issue that the city government will (implicitly or explicitly) decide when setting future utility&#13;
tariffs to residents. When cost recovery reaches 100 percent, the city government will no longer finance&#13;
utility services, but will still need to collect payments from residents for loan repayment, either through&#13;
continued collection of utility payments with a loan repayment component, or through a separate charge&#13;
if utility payments from residents will go directly to utility suppliers at some future point. Residents will&#13;
also experience increased comfort within buildings (see Annex K).&#13;
5.           Incentive for municipal organizations like design institutes and housing maintenance&#13;
organizations are less clear. These organizations will need to be administratively directed by the city&#13;
government, but such direction may not provide adequate incentives. Municipal heat supply and&#13;
distribution companies, which profit from increasing heat sales, will not have strong financial incentives&#13;
to participate in the project unless some part of the investments target the distribution system or unless&#13;
reductions in energy demand defer future capacity needs that these companies would have difficulty&#13;
meeting by themselves. The regional (oblast) energo, which also profits from increased heat sales,&#13;
likewise has less clear incentives to participate in the project. Additional regulations, for example&#13;
mandating payments to the energo for heat based meters at the point of city purchases of heat, may need&#13;
to be established by the regional energy commnission and the regional government. Such meters and&#13;
regulations already exist in two of the six candidate cities. Incentives for the regional energy commission&#13;
may include technical assistance to strengthen their capacities and capabilities.&#13;
&#13;

6.             The impact of increased energy prices is shown in Figure 1-2. As energy prices reach&#13;
world levels, the cost of delivering utility services to households increases, and the volume of the flow&#13;
of funds in the shaded section increases.&#13;
7.             The impact of policy and institutional changes is shown in Figure 1-3.  Municipal&#13;
subsidies for heat, hot water, and cold water/sewage are eliminated, and the only financial flows&#13;
involving the city directly are housing allowances. Enterprise subsidies for enterprise-owned housing are&#13;
also eliminated as that housing is divested to the city. As city and enterprise subsidies are cut, households&#13;
necessarily assume greater financial burdens for paying for their utility services.&#13;
8.             The impact of investments financed by the project is shown in Figure 1-4.  Energy&#13;
efficiency renovations and the creation of a competitive market for maintenance services lowers the&#13;
volume of the flow of funds and services within the restricted circle. In other words, this mitigates the&#13;
increased burden for households, who as a result of the policy and institutional reforms under the project&#13;
assume greater responsibility for paying for these flows.&#13;

ANNEX K&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL RISK MITIGATION PLAN&#13;
1.           The Bank has determined that this project requires a category "B" Environmental&#13;
Mitigation Plan (EMP), as defined in the Bank's Operational Directive on Environmental Assessment,&#13;
O.D. 4.01. As a category "B" project, a limited analysis of specific environmental impacts is required,&#13;
but not a full environmnental impact assessment (EIA).&#13;
2.            The Russian Federation Law on Environmental Protection (No. 2060-1 adopted 12/19/91)&#13;
determines general requirements for siting, designing, and construction of projects, as well as the&#13;
responsibilities of the State Ecological Expertise to review and approve projects. EIA requirements are&#13;
outlined in the Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines (1992) by the Ministry of Environmental&#13;
Protection and Natural Resources (MEPNR). MEPNR Order No. 222 (7/18/94) contains a list of the&#13;
types of projects for which a formal EIA is required.&#13;
3.            Under the above Russian Federation laws and guidelines, no formal EIA is required by&#13;
the Russian government for this project.  Confirming this conclusion, the director of the Legal&#13;
Department of MEPNR stated to a Bank representative that no fonral EIA is required for a housing&#13;
renovation project. Rather, a more limited environmental analysis is required. This environmental&#13;
analysis is subject to review and approval by the State Ecological Expertise of MEPNR, according to&#13;
Resoiution No. 942 of the Council of Ministers ("Status of State Ecological Expertise," 9/22/93).&#13;
4.            Since the primary environmental impacts and mitigation measures are associated with&#13;
residential building renovation, the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation will review project&#13;
plans and procurement documents as appropriate for environmental impacts and mitigation measures and&#13;
for compliance with appropriate construction standards and normative documents.&#13;
5.            Ground soil contamination at the sites of proposed building renovation will preclude&#13;
investments in those buildings. Sampling of ground soils will be required at selected project sites, in&#13;
advance of final building selection for renovation. The sites to be tested will be those in or near areas&#13;
of industrial concentration or areas of known or suspected soil contamination, as indicated by consultation&#13;
with municipal environmental departments or authorities. Ground soil testing will be the responsibility&#13;
of the local implementation groups (LIGs) and central project implementation unit (CPIU). Ground soil&#13;
testing is a relatively new field in Russia, and local capacity for performing such testing is still limited.&#13;
Thus, external expertise will probably be required in the short-term although local expertise will be&#13;
phased in as soon as possible.&#13;
6.            Specific engineering measures to be carried out will be finalized after loan approval, but&#13;
all construction work for the project will involve renovation of existing buildings. No construction of&#13;
new buildings or facilities will occur. Guidelines in the Bank's Environmental Assessment Sourcebook&#13;
(1991) do not explicitly cover this situation. The section on large-scale housing projects (vol. 11, p.196)&#13;
deals primarily with new construction and site development and has limited applicability to building&#13;
renovations.&#13;
7.           The beneficial impacts of the project include reduced atmospheric emissions of nitrogen-&#13;
oxides (NOX), sulfur-dioxide (SO2), and carbon-dioxide (CO2) from reduced consumption of natural gas&#13;
and mazut (heavy fuel oil) in district heating plants or combined heat-and-power plants. Estimates of&#13;
emissions reductions depend upon the specific engineering measures ultimately adopted and the fuel mix&#13;
of displaced heat sources. A preliminary estimate for gas savings of the full project is on the order of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                       Staff Appraisal Report: Russia Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project&#13;
300 million cubic meters annually, and for mazut savings is on the order of 150,000 tons annually.&#13;
These fuel savings would result in reductions of SO2 by 7600 tons, NO, by 1600 tons, and CO2 by&#13;
950,000 tons annually.&#13;
8.            Since natural-gas transmission capacity or administrative allocations by Gazprom often&#13;
limit gas consumption in specific regions of Russia, the reduction of natural gas consumption can also&#13;
promote economic development by freeing gas supplies for other uses in a specific region. Gas&#13;
allocations that fall short of demand were observed in several of the cities that are candidates at the time&#13;
of project appraisal.&#13;
9.            Occupants of renovated buildings should in general experience less undesirable apartrnent&#13;
overheating, and experience more uniform and comfortable supplies of heat and hot water. Indicative&#13;
surveys and measurements from residential building renovation projects that have already occurred in the&#13;
former Soviet Union have shown that residents report improved indoor conditions, and that building&#13;
heating responds better to changes in outdoor temperature, resulting in better comfort.&#13;
10.           The potential adverse impacts of the project are the following:&#13;
a.     Change in Indoor Air Quality. Indoor air quality for occupants may change due to&#13;
changes in building insulation, heat regulation, and air infiltration resulting from&#13;
renovations.&#13;
b.     Changes in Indoor Air Temperature, Humidity, Heat and Hot Water Supply. Residents&#13;
of renovated buildings or nearby unrenovated buildings may experience changes in heat&#13;
and hot-water supply operating regimes (schedules), average indoor temperatures, or&#13;
indoor humidity. These changes may be involuntary, such as reduced overheating of&#13;
historically overheated apartments through building-level automatic controls, or may be&#13;
voluntary, as in the case of occupant-regulated heating controls made possible by the&#13;
project.&#13;
C.    Health and Safety of Occupants and Construction Workers. The health and safety of&#13;
occupants or construction workers may be affected during renovation construction.&#13;
Renovation work will be conducted while buildings are fully occupied and in-service.&#13;
Injuries can result from unsafe working conditions or procedures. Temporary disruptions&#13;
to hot water or heating supply can lead to an increased incidence of burn accidents or&#13;
electrical fires if residents boil water on stovetops or use electric-resistance heaters during&#13;
these disruptions.&#13;
d.    Asbestos. Hazards to occupants and construction workers may exist from asbestos in&#13;
existing building materials if any existing asbestos insulation or asbestos-insulated piping&#13;
is being removed or replaced. Transport and disposal of asbestos also creates additional&#13;
hazards. Asbestos is no longer used in residential buildings, although older buildings&#13;
may contain asbestos-cement insulated pipes. The frequency of such occurrences is&#13;
expected to be small.&#13;
e.     Ozone depleting substances. Installation of insulating plastic foams may utilize blowing&#13;
agents that are harmful to the ozone layer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex K. Environmental Risk Mitigation Plan                                                  3&#13;
11.           Mitigation measures that need to be taken are the following:&#13;
a.     Indoor Air Quality. Technical design and specifications in procurement documents by&#13;
the Bank's technical consultants will ensure that ventilation measures provide an adequate&#13;
ventilation rate of at least 0.5 air-changes per hour under all circumstances. Procurement&#13;
documents will specify that contractors perform air infiltration measurements after&#13;
renovations to ensure that installations meet design requirements.&#13;
b.     Changes in Indoor Air Temperature or Humidity. Currently, indoor air temperatures&#13;
are determined by the district heating company and the city govermment. Indoor&#13;
temperatures are supposed to remain above 18 degrees Centigrade, but in practice often&#13;
fall below this level during particularly cold winter conditions. The project will have no&#13;
direct influence over operation of district heating systems. But the renovations installed&#13;
under the project will make it easier to maintain temperatures above this level.&#13;
Automatic controls within buildings will be set to acceptable temperature levels as&#13;
determined by municipal authorities and district heating authorities, and with the&#13;
participation of building occupants.  Reduction of apartment overheating so that&#13;
temperatures are more "normal" is considered a project benefit, although may not be seen&#13;
as such by some occupants. Indoor humidity is expected to remain the same or increase&#13;
as a result of reduced air infiltration.&#13;
c.     Construction Safety. General contractors will be responsible for construction safety of&#13;
occupants and workers. In addition to the World Bank Occupation Health and Safety&#13;
Guidelines (1988), Russian Federation requirements will be adhered to in procurement&#13;
documents for general contractors and all subcontractors. Furthermore, each city has its&#13;
own occupational safety regulations. Renovation procedures should conform to all city&#13;
regulations. Relevant Russian Federation documents and city regulations are currently&#13;
under investigation by Bank consultants.&#13;
d.     Asbestos. Asbestos-containing products will be prohibited from use in renovations.&#13;
Federal laws on residential building renovations do not yet exist, so there is no explicit&#13;
Russian government requirement or procedure on what to do with existing asbestos-&#13;
insulated piping in buildings. Although each situation must be reviewed individually and&#13;
actions must comply with local laws in each city, the project will require general&#13;
contractors to ensure that asbestos-insulated pipes be removed and replaced in entirety.&#13;
Russian worker-safety standards for handling asbestos are outlined in construction&#13;
standard SNiP 2.03.09-95 (1985), "Asbestos-Cement Construction" and in state standard&#13;
GOST 12871-83E (1983). Prior to tender preparation for building renovations, the&#13;
Project will commission a consultant to compare these standards with those of the World&#13;
Health Organization (WHO), the International Labor Organization (ILO), and other&#13;
relevant international bodies, and to work with the Russian government to incorporate&#13;
the most appropriate standards into tender documents for procedures on removal,&#13;
transport, and disposal. By the time tender preparations are complete (late 1996),&#13;
Russian standards on building renovations, and specifically any asbestos-related&#13;
requirements, may be further advanced and can be incorporated into this process. It will&#13;
be the responsibility of the general contractor to provide the necessary training and&#13;
oversight of subcontractors to ensure that these procedures are followed, and local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                       Staff Appraisal Report: Russia Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project&#13;
implementation groups (LIGs) will also receive training to enable proper supervision of&#13;
contractors.&#13;
e.     Ozone-Depleting Substances.  If plastic foam  insulation is used in any building&#13;
renovations, blowing agents must be non ozone-depleting substances. Tender documents&#13;
will state this requirement.&#13;
f.    Heat and Hot Water Supply Disruptions. Heating system renovations that require the&#13;
heating system to be shut down will occur in non-heating-season periods whenever&#13;
possible. Valves and bypass arrangements installed during non-heating-season periods&#13;
will allow some heating-system renovations to proceed during the heating season without&#13;
supply disruptions. Hot water system disruptions will be necessary in many cases, but&#13;
their impact can be minimized by performing work at night and/or informing occupants&#13;
beforehand. Heating system and hot water outage times and durations will conform to&#13;
local standards and practices and will be minimized. Contractors will be responsible for&#13;
planning their work to minimize outages and for obtaining necessary clearances&#13;
beforehand from local building maintenance organization before conducting work, for&#13;
informing occupants in advance.&#13;
12.          Compliance with the above mitigation requirements will be monitored by local municipal&#13;
officials and those responsible for oversight of general contractors and subcontractors (from the CPIU&#13;
and LIGs). Local implementation groups and/or the central project implementation unit will review&#13;
variances or special circumstances and will provide resolution as necessary. In particular, one person&#13;
in each local implementation group will be designated as responsible for environmental mitigation.&#13;
13.          Institutional capabilities by various branches and departments of the Ministry of&#13;
Construction will be strengthened as a result of this project. Two specific areas include standards for&#13;
residential-building renovation and ground-soil testing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX L&#13;
RESULTS OF HOUSEHOLD SURVEY&#13;
1.           A household survey was conducted in a random sample of 508 households in Vladimnir&#13;
(population 350,000) and 300 households in Volkhov (population 30,000) in September and October&#13;
1995.&#13;
2.            The objectives of the survey were to:&#13;
a.    identify knowledge of, attitudes toward, and general perceptions of the need for proposed&#13;
retrofits;&#13;
b.    explore major problems with the provision of heat and water;&#13;
c.    provide information on average utility use;&#13;
d.    identify prevailing opinions about the current maintenance system, privatization, and the&#13;
housing allowance system;&#13;
e.    determine potential willingness to pay and to take loans for installation of retrofits; and&#13;
f.    anticipate changes in behavior that might result from metering and installation of&#13;
proposed retrofits.&#13;
3.            In addition, the survey provided an opportunity to correlate the above information with&#13;
data about the type, age, and location of the respondents' buildings; the location of the respondents'&#13;
apartments in the buildings (e.g., corner, middle); as well as personal information such as education,&#13;
income level, age, sex, and profession.&#13;
4.           In some cases, the survey results confirmed that retrofits could increase comfort as well&#13;
as reduce costs. Respondents reported widespread dissatisfaction with the heating systems in their&#13;
apartments, reporting that they feel cold during the heating season unless they use supplementary sources&#13;
of heating such as electric ranges or gas heaters, and that heat supply is terminated before the cold season&#13;
ends. In many cases, however, respondents could not identify all the causes for high energy losses in&#13;
their apartments, and therefore were not aware of some of the most cost-effective methods to prevent&#13;
energy loss. They tended as a whole to focus on the perception that their radiators were not giving off&#13;
enough heat, and therefore felt that the solution lay in making the radiators hotter. Overall, tenants&#13;
expressed enthusiasm for proposals that would make their apartments warmer. Most tenants (93-96&#13;
percent) currently insulate doors and weatherize windows using homemade devices, and, less often,&#13;
replace radiators. More than half of the respondents were willing to have such retrofits installed&#13;
professionally.&#13;
5.           The survey will contribute to future project design by: determining tenants' attitudes&#13;
towards metering; augmenting findings in the demonstration phase about utility usage and the correlation&#13;
between building and apartment characteristics and temperature levels; and identifying the most urgent&#13;
housing issues. Survey results indicate expected acceptance of proposed retrofits as well as potential&#13;
willingness to pay and borrow for retrofits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                     Staff Appraisal Report: Russia Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project&#13;
6.           Most households were interested in paying for heat on the basis of their actual&#13;
consumption (85 percent in Vladimir and 75 percent in Volkhov), although only a few would be willing&#13;
to pay for meters themselves (4.9 percent in Vladimir and 1.7 percent in Volkhov). Greater interest was&#13;
expressed in heat regulators (90.2 percent in Vladimir and 77 percent in Volkhov), and more would be&#13;
willing to pay for them (20.7 percent in Vladimir and 9 percent in Volkhov). Under 5 percent of&#13;
respondents in each city was willing to take out loans to pay for heat-saving equipment.&#13;
7.           Survey results also confirmed the direct correlation between comfort levels and apartment&#13;
location in the buildings, with the most frequent perception of low temperatures by those living in corner&#13;
apartments on the top and bottom floors.&#13;
8.           Between one-fifth and one-third of respondents thought humidity was a problem;&#13;
approximately one-third worry about drafts; and one-tenth complain of overheating. Almost all families&#13;
report water shortages andjfrequent interruptions of water supply, particularly of hot water in the summer&#13;
months (90 to 150 days). Respondents claimed that they would make efforts to conserve water if they&#13;
were charged for consumption and approximately half of the respondents said that they would turn down&#13;
their heat at night if they had control over it.&#13;
9.           Loans for the purchase of retrofits were of interest to many, although few (1.2 percent&#13;
in Vladimir and 4 percent in Volkhov) have taken loans in the past. Respondents' top priority for&#13;
borrowing was improvement of building or apartment appearance; heat-saving devices ranked third.&#13;
10.          Some results of the survey also will provide a guide for shaping the project's publicity&#13;
component. For example, the survey evidenced that willingness to permit installation of a particular&#13;
measure was directly linked to perceived need.&#13;
11.          In many cases, the survey confirmed attitudes toward reform measures that are included&#13;
in the project and has provided valuable input into implementation strategies. More than half of the&#13;
respondents complained about the quality of the maintenance services, but somewhat fewer of them think&#13;
that the quality of private service will be higher. They do, however,. believe that private maintenance&#13;
services would be more expensive. The survey showed that many people did not privatize their&#13;
apartments because they thought monthly payment would increase or that they would have to pay property&#13;
taxes, and because there was no deadline for privatization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX M&#13;
SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.            In return for implementing a range of policy and institutional reforms needed to make&#13;
housing divestiture feasible in the short run and sustainable over the longer run, EHDP will finance&#13;
investments that will both reduce operating costs and increase comfort levels in the housing stock. The&#13;
project includes a strong package of technical assistance to support the implementation of the required&#13;
policy and institutional changes, and to design and carry out the investments. Because implementation&#13;
of the investments are contingent upon progress in policy and institutional reforms, project cities are&#13;
unlikely to proceed with implementation at the same rate. Thus, the Central Project Implementation&#13;
Unit's (CPIU) role in coordinating and assessing the phasing of activities in the cities will be critical.&#13;
CPIU Supervision Responsibilities&#13;
2.           To ensure that project objectives are achieved, the CPIU will have to successfully&#13;
integrate monitoring of both the policy and investment components of the project. Monitoring of progress&#13;
in achieving policy objectives will be done in two ways. First, cities will be expected to meet, and will&#13;
be measured against policy and institutional reform targets every year (see Annex T for Year 1 targets).&#13;
Second, cities will also be evaluated on their progress on policy reforms using the policy monitoring&#13;
indicators (see Table 4-4). Monitoring of the investment component will simflarly be carried out along&#13;
two parallel tracks. Aggregate disbursement will be measured against the disbursement schedule set out&#13;
in Table 4-2, but investments will also be evaluated using the performance indicators (see Table 4-5).&#13;
Finally, the effectiveness of technical assistance being channeled to cities under the project will be&#13;
evaluated against program output targets as well as beneficiary assessments. These evaluations will be&#13;
integrated to form a basis for the CPIU's annual operating plans and schedules for procurement and&#13;
disbursement. All of these elements will be included in the CPIU's assessment and reporting of annual&#13;
progress for submission to the Government and the Bank.&#13;
3.            Annual reporting will be carried out in a three-stage process. On September 15 of every&#13;
year the CPIU will submit to the Bank an agreed upon work plan for each city for the next calendar year.&#13;
This will include a description of the size, nature, timing, and handling of procurement actions for each&#13;
city, and confirmation that both the LIGs and the CPIU have adequate resources to handle the aggregate&#13;
workload. Subsequently in November, the CPIU will carry out preliminary assessments of each city's&#13;
performance against the annual policy and institutional reform targets for that year, and propose new&#13;
targets for the next calendar year. These targets, upon confirmation by the Bank, will be communicated&#13;
to the cities by the CPIU. By March 1 the CPIU will carry out final assessments of city performance&#13;
against annual policy and institutional targets and submit to the Bank for its no-objection recommendations&#13;
whether each city should continue to be eligible to participate in that year's investment cycle.&#13;
4.            The CPIU will also be responsible for monthly and quarterly reporting of project data,&#13;
including: overall procurement progress and project costing; revisions of cost estimates; procurement&#13;
schedules; disbursement progress and completion dates; and compliance with prior reviews and aggregate&#13;
limits on specified methods of Bank-financed procurement. This includes gathering data, if any, from&#13;
LIGs and other project participants, including bilateral donors. As necessary, the CPIU will work with&#13;
the LIGs to establish project budgeting and accounting systems to track both Bank and non-Bank project&#13;
funding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                        Staff Appraisal Report: Russia Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project&#13;
5.            In the period prior to the mid-term review scheduled for this project, the CPIU will&#13;
prepare, on the basis of the most recent annual report described above, a strategy paper justifying either&#13;
continuation of project implementation as described in the original project and loan documents, or a&#13;
revised plan of action. This will be submitted to the Bank six weeks before the scheduled supervision&#13;
mission.&#13;
Bank Supervision Responsibilities&#13;
6.            The proposed Bank supervision plan and schedule are summarized in Table M-1.&#13;
7.            Bank supervision will begin with a project launch mission at loan effectiveness and a&#13;
supervision mission no more than three months thereafter to ensure implementation systems are in place&#13;
and that participants the Bank's procurement, disbursement and project accounting processes. Following&#13;
this, at least two supervision missions a year will be scheduled, to discuss or participate in the annual&#13;
assessments carried out by the CPIU every year. These initial missions will cover all policy, physical,&#13;
and financial aspects of the project. The supervision missions are expected to involve the Task Manager,&#13;
financial and economic specialists from Headquarters, and procurement and technical specialists, including&#13;
possibly sociologists and environmental experts. Missions will review the CPIU's assessment of&#13;
implementation issues and progress toward targets, and CPIU plans for work and remedial action. Bank&#13;
supervision missions will also include field visits to project cities, and city officials and tenants will be&#13;
interviewed. The project's technology and engineering consultants will also be interviewed to ensure&#13;
progress is being made in contracting and installation of building retrofits. In addition, the CPIU's annual&#13;
reports will provide the basis for supervision missions in the last quarter of each project year to assess&#13;
progress during the previous period, achievement of project milestones and discuss work plans for the&#13;
next year.&#13;
8.            Periodic Bank supervision missions will, whenever possible, be carried out by staff who&#13;
have been involved in project planning and initiation. Supervision missions will be supplemented, if&#13;
necessary, by follow-up activities by designated members of the Bank's Resident Mission.&#13;
Notwithstanding, every effort will be made to combine supervision activities under this project with other&#13;
Bank activities in the country or region to minimize cost and conserve counterpart staff time.&#13;
9.            To be consistent with Bank guidelines for supervision activities (OD 13.05), supervision&#13;
missions will focus on the following key progress indicators or factors:&#13;
a.    implementation delays, cost overru.as or disbursement irregularities;&#13;
b.     SA operations;&#13;
c.     project accounting and audit scheduling/results;&#13;
d.     compliance with project objectives, legal covenants, provision of counterpart funding, and&#13;
performance management targets;&#13;
e.     compliance with procurement guidelines;&#13;
f.     satisfying Bank environmental requirements and mitigation strategies, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex M. Supervision Plan                                                                 3&#13;
g.     compliance with agreed upon technical and implementation standards for the public sector&#13;
--            and private sector elements of the project.&#13;
In addition, the CPIU's annual reports will provide the basis for supervision missions in the last quarter&#13;
of each project year to assess progress during the previous period, achievement of project milestones and&#13;
discuss work plans for the next year.&#13;
10.          Based on the mid-term project strategy prepared by the CPIU, the Bank will conduct a&#13;
detailed mid-term review approximately 30 months after loan effectiveness to review a range of project&#13;
issues. It will be held in lieu of the third annual policy reform review for the cities, and be expanded&#13;
in scope to include not only progress against annual reform targets, but issues of implementation capacity,&#13;
rates of disbursement, decentralization of management, municipal creditworthiness, and possible&#13;
reallocations of funds among cities. At this time each city's progress in implementing the investment&#13;
component of the project will be carefully reviewed to determine whether LIGs could be tasked with&#13;
increasing responsibility for procurement and disbursement. Implementation capacity as evidenced by&#13;
disbursement rates will also be used to determine whether undisbursed subloan amounts might be&#13;
reallocated among cities.&#13;
11.          A Project Completion Report and wrap-up audit will be prepared by the CPIU at the end&#13;
of the program.&#13;

ANNEX P&#13;
Cr SELECrlON PROCEDURE&#13;
Background&#13;
1.           General principles for city selection were determined during the first project mission in&#13;
the fall of 1994. In discussions with counterpart agencies it was agreed that:&#13;
a.    Cities that are potential candidates for participation in the project should vary in their:&#13;
size (with the emphasis to medium-sized cities and inclusion of enterprise-towns),&#13;
administrative status, and geographical location.&#13;
b.     Potential candidates should be leaders in housing reform implementation and should&#13;
demonstrate their commitment to enterprise housing divestiture.&#13;
c.    The city selection procedure should be of a competitive nature. Potential candidates&#13;
would be invited to participate in the competition. At the end of a competitive process&#13;
four or five cities would be selected to be the final participants in the project. Terms of&#13;
competition would include both quantitative and qualitative criteria of cities' progress in&#13;
the areas of divestiture, formation of competitive market for maintenance services,&#13;
privatization of apartments and condominium formation, and cost recovery.&#13;
2.            On the basis of principles mentioned above, a 'long list" of cities was formed. It&#13;
included 12 cities: Ryazan', Vladimir, Yaroslavl', Petrozavodsk, Orenburg, Krasnoyarsk, Novocherkassk,&#13;
Cherepovets, Zhukovskiy, Volkhov, Kulebaki, and Efremov (for more details see Table P-1). This initial&#13;
selection was based on proposals of government officials from the counterpart agencies, opinion of&#13;
privatization and housing experts (from the Russian Privatization Center, the Urban Institute, and the&#13;
Institute on Housing and Municipal Economy), impressions from city visits of the World Bank mission,&#13;
and results of surveys of five enterprises and municipalities in nine cities.&#13;
3.            In February 1995, a meeting of officials from the twelve candidate cities was organized.&#13;
It was hosted by the Government and the World Bank mission. In the course of this meeting the main&#13;
ideas of the project and principles of city selection were presented to the participants and their reaction&#13;
was received both in the general discussion and in separate meetings with each city. On the basis of this&#13;
information the project preparation team was able to finalize the set of criteria to be used for competitive&#13;
process.&#13;
4.            The general reaction of city officials to the project presentation was very positive and after&#13;
the meeting all 12 potential candidates confirmed their participation in the competition. It was agreed&#13;
that in the course of competition all the cities from the "long list" would receive training in the areas of&#13;
competitive maintenance, condominium formation, and procurement. All of them would also receive&#13;
preliminary engineering and design information on the energy efficiency measures and would have access&#13;
to information on the actual results of energy-saving investments over the course of the project.&#13;
&#13;

City Selection Criteria&#13;
5.             The list of city selection criteria was drafted on the basis of discussions with officials from&#13;
counterpart agencies and finalized after the meeting of candidate-city representatives. It was sent to the&#13;
cities after they confirmed their participation in the competition. This list included a set of minimum&#13;
standards to qualify for the project, but it was specified that the selection of winners would be based on&#13;
a comparison of real results among participants in order to keep the number of finally selected cities&#13;
reasonably limited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex P. City Selection Procedure                                                            3&#13;
6.            The following criteria were officially presented for the cities as the basis for the final&#13;
selection:&#13;
a.     formal agreements for divestiture by the end of 1995 of at least 80 percent of the&#13;
enterprise housing stock that is eligible for divestiture according to Russian legislation&#13;
and regulations (with corresponding utility networks), taking the amount of enterprise&#13;
housing stock as of January 1, 1992 to be 100 percent;&#13;
b.     divestiture of all maintenance units from those enterprises that would hold no housing on&#13;
their balance by the end of 1995 (divested units would be either privatized or reorganized&#13;
into separate municipal enterprise but not included into existing municipal maintenance&#13;
structure);&#13;
c.    transfer of both residential and non-residential premises in residential buildings divested&#13;
by enterprises since March 1995 to the balance of the same balance holder, preferably&#13;
the "single customer service";&#13;
d.     functional and organizational separation of customers and contractors for the rendering&#13;
of maintenance services;&#13;
e.     at least one open non-discriminatory tender for the rendering of maintenance services&#13;
organized by the end of competition;&#13;
f.     privatization of 40 percent of apartments in the municipal and enterprise housing stock&#13;
by the end of competition;&#13;
g.     creation of a relevant regulatory framework for condominium formation;&#13;
h.     cost recovery from residents' fees of at least 30 percent by July 1, 1995 (with regulations&#13;
in place mandating at least 40 percent by the end of 1995) with a functioning housing&#13;
allowance system  to protect the poor.  Cities were also proposed to identify&#13;
demonopolization measures for maintenance market they were going to undertake in&#13;
1995-1996.&#13;
7.            It was agreed with the cities that their progress would be measured by the information&#13;
they were obliged to provide to the project preparation team (in response to the uniform information&#13;
request which was sent to the cities) and by reports of consultants which would visit the cities to clarify&#13;
the information and obtain more details. The deadline for reporting was defined as June 20, 1995. By&#13;
this time the cities had to provide information about their actual results and to prove (by legal decisions,&#13;
officially approved schedules, etc.) further progress by the end of 1995 where necessary.&#13;
Recommended Cities&#13;
8.            In the course of the competition, the project preparation team received information from&#13;
and visited all eleven cities (Krasnoyarsk declined to participate). On the basis of all this information&#13;
three groups of cities were identified at the end of the competitive process:&#13;
a.     only one city, Ryazan', met all the minimum requirements;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                        Staff Appraisal Report: Russia Enterprise Housing Divesdtiure Project&#13;
b.     five cities clearly failed to meet the criteria because of poor progress either in enterprise&#13;
housing divestiture (Yaroslavl, Efremov) or in implementation of housing reform&#13;
(Cherepovets, Kulebaki, Zhukovskiy, Efremov);&#13;
c.     five cities showed mixed results: they had good progress in certain areas but didn't meet&#13;
minimum standards in the others (Novocherkassk, Vladimir, Petrozavodsk, Volkhov,&#13;
Orenburg).&#13;
9.            During the Pre-Appraisal missions, the project preparation team visited all the cities from&#13;
the first and third groups to make the final check and clarification of data, negotiate further steps, discuss&#13;
obligations related to inclusion in the project with municipal and regional authorities, and try to assess&#13;
implementation capacity of each city.&#13;
10.           On the basis of assessment of the results of the competition and the pre-appraisal city&#13;
visits, a shortlist of six cities (Ryazan', Novocherkassk, Vladimir, Petrozavodsk, Volkhov, Orenburg)&#13;
was formed. This list was discussed and confirmed by Russian counterparts on the meeting of the working&#13;
group. Among these six cities only Ryazan' was unconditionally selected at this stage. All the others&#13;
were included conditionally. For them the term of competition was prolonged to the end of September&#13;
and intensive technical assistance was offered to help them meet all the criteria which were not yet met.&#13;
As a result, all the cities in the shortlist proved to be able to meet the criteria and were finally included&#13;
in the project.&#13;
11.           At the same time one of the "losers," Cherepovets, continued to express great interest in&#13;
participating in the project and stressed its commitment to fast implementation of housing reform. Taking&#13;
into account that Cherepovets had made substantial if not adequate progress on reforming and had proved&#13;
its high implementation capacity in other World Bank projects, it was decided to consider Cherepovets&#13;
as a "reserve" city. This means that this city can be included in the project at a future date if: 1) one of&#13;
the cities-participants drops out or is removed from the project; 2) Cherepovets undertakes all of the&#13;
policy and institutional reform measures required at the time of inclusion.&#13;
12.           This "6+1" formula was approved by the EHDP Governmental Working Group in the&#13;
course of the Appraisal mission, when the final review of progress in policy and institutional actions&#13;
undertaken by candidate cities was made. A detailed description of six participating cities and the reserve&#13;
one follows below. All the information is as of October-November 1995.&#13;
a.     Ryazan'. More than 60 percent of enterprise housing stock has already been divested and&#13;
the city administration submitted the schedule for further divestiture to reach 80 percent&#13;
by the end of the year. The functions of customer and contractor have been separated,&#13;
and a "single customer service" was created as a part of municipality to play the role of&#13;
client on behalf of residents of municipal buildings. The city administration achieved&#13;
good results in demonopolization of maintenance market. The first competitive tender for&#13;
maintenance services took place in March 1995 and the second one is scheduled for the&#13;
end of the year. The city of Ryazan' is the leader in condominium creation; 28 condos&#13;
have already been formed and its condominium regulations for a long time was used as&#13;
a model for the other cities. Cost recovery level has reached 30 percent and the housing&#13;
allowance system works very efficiently. The level of privatization of apartments is 32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Am= P. Ciy Selection Procedure                                                            5&#13;
percent. The city administration of Ryazan' demonstrated good potential implementation&#13;
capacity and a high level of commitment to the project ideas.&#13;
b.     V&amp;ndimir. About 50 percent of enterprise housing has been divested. Now the city&#13;
administration is working with 10 more enterprises on divestiture issues to reach by the&#13;
end of the year an 83 percent level. The city achieved good results in housing reform&#13;
implementation. "Single customer service" has been created. The decision was made that&#13;
maintenance of all the divested housing would be organized through competitive tenders.&#13;
The first tender took place in July 1995 and was very successful. Condominium&#13;
regulations are in place and three condos have been formed. Cost recovery is maintained&#13;
on a 30 percent level for all services except cold water and at 100 percent for cold water,&#13;
and the housing allowance system works quite efficiently. Privatization of apartments has&#13;
reached the 40 percent level. The city administration has some experience in working&#13;
with energy efficiency investments, but needs to make some additional efforts to increase&#13;
its implementation capacity.&#13;
c.    Novocherkassk. The process of divestiture in the city is going rather fast, and 78 percent&#13;
of enterprise housing has already been transferred to municipality. Single Customer&#13;
service has been formed and the first tender for maintenance services took place in&#13;
February 1995. The next tender is scheduled for the end of the year. The city is the&#13;
pioneer in privatization of maintenance enterprises. Condominium regulations are in place&#13;
and 9 condos have been formed, including 2 on the basis of enterprise housing. Cost&#13;
recovery level is about 40 percent and the housing allowance system performs well.&#13;
Privatization of apartments is extremely high - about 70 percent. The city administration&#13;
is interested in the project, but has to improve data collection in the city and find&#13;
qualified people to work on the project to make implementation successful.&#13;
d.     Orenburg. The city achieved rather good results in the divestiture area, and by the end&#13;
of 1995 almost all enterprise housing stock except Gazprom's (about 12 percent of total&#13;
housing stock in the city) was to be accepted by municipality. Their progress in housing&#13;
reform is also impressive. Cost recovery is maintained on the level of 40 percent and the&#13;
city administration is committed to reach 50 percent level in the beginning of 1996. The&#13;
housing allowance system works quite efficiently. Apartment privatization goes quickly,&#13;
at least in municipal housing stock (45 percent, but they do not have reliable information&#13;
on enterprise housing). Single Customer service has been created. The first tender for&#13;
maintenance services took place in September 1995. Three condos are in the process of&#13;
registration, though it's necessary to improve the city's regulations in this area. The city&#13;
administration demonstrated good potential for project implementation, the ability to form&#13;
qualified and competent group to work with project preparation team and a high level of&#13;
responsiveness for project preparation team requirements.&#13;
e.     Petrozavodsk. The city administration is moving fast in implementing housing reform.&#13;
Single Customer service was created recently. A competitive tender for maintenance&#13;
services took place in October 1995 and was very successful. In general there are very&#13;
good preconditions for competitive maintenance in this city as Petrozavodsk was very&#13;
active in private sector involvement in maintenance activity (more than 30 private firms&#13;
provide different kinds of maintenance services and a big joint stock company which is&#13;
going to specialize in this area was created). Condominium regulations are in place and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                        Staff Appraisal Report: Russia Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project&#13;
an active publicity campaign was started, though no condos have been actually formed.&#13;
Cost recovery is close to 30 percent, which is particularly important as Petrozavodsk has&#13;
already faced world level energy prices. A housing allowance system is in place and&#13;
works efficiently. Privatization of apartments is on the level of 33 percent. Enterprise&#13;
housing divestiture is moving fast; by the end of 1995 only two enterprises eligible for&#13;
divestiture will keep housing on their balance. The city administration is experienced&#13;
enough in energy efficiency projects and has demonstrated high potential project&#13;
implementation capacity and high level of commitment to project ideas. The group of&#13;
people working with the project preparation team had good skills and a high ability to&#13;
collect and process information, and were very responsive to project preparation team&#13;
requirements.&#13;
f.     Volkhov. This city is the only representative of enterprise-towns on the "shortlist". It&#13;
was very active in the divestiture area and in some areas of housing reform. "Single&#13;
customer service" has been created. Cost recovery exceeds 40 percent level. A housing&#13;
allowance system is in place but needs some improvements. Privatization of apartments&#13;
is on the level of 35 percent. Competitive tender for maintenance services was announced&#13;
but still not completed as the city administration was working very seriously with&#13;
potential bidders. Work on condominium creation has been started though both&#13;
regulations and logistics in this area have to be improved. The city administration&#13;
demonstrated sufficient capacity for project implementation and interest for participating&#13;
in the project.&#13;
g.     Cherepovets. The city is the leader in divestiture process: more than 90 percent of&#13;
enterprise housing has already been transferred to municipality. Some progress has been&#13;
made in housing reform, though it was not sufficient for inclusion into the project.&#13;
"Single customer service" has not been formed yet and financial and management&#13;
responsibilities for housing and utility sector are divided between three departments in&#13;
the municipality, though some reorganization plans are being discussed currently in the&#13;
city. Tariffs for population were raised 2.6 timnes from the beginning of November 1995,&#13;
but cost recovery is still rather low: 40 percent for maintenance and 13 percent for&#13;
utilities. A housing allowance system was created, but did not function because of the&#13;
low level of cost recovery. Competitive tender for maintenance services took place, but&#13;
only for two buildings and was not very successful because of this limited scale.&#13;
Regulations for condominium creation were issued and a publicity campaign has been&#13;
started but not too much progress was achieved. Apartment privatization is on the level&#13;
of 27 percent and the city administration is planning an active campaign to increase this&#13;
indicator. The city administration considers energy efficiency improvements as one of&#13;
the main directions of its activity and has accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience&#13;
in this area.&#13;
13.           It was decided to maintain competitive relations among cities-participants in the course&#13;
of project implementation as well. Each year of the project the cities have to prove their ability to make&#13;
further progress in policy and institutional reforms by meeting policy and institutional targets, the list of&#13;
which has to be approved and sent to the cities in the beginning of each year. If some cities seriously fail&#13;
to meet the indicators or prove to have no sufficient capacity for project implementation it can be&#13;
considered as a reason to redistribute loan money or even to exclude these cities from the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex P. City Seketion Procedure                                                             7&#13;
Lessons Leamed&#13;
14.           Selection of project participants through competitive procedure proved to be very efficient&#13;
for acceleration of reforms implementation. All the cities in the long list participated in training courses&#13;
and improved their knowledge about housing reform ideas and implementation mechanisms. It was&#13;
especially important for enterprise-towns, for which information about housing reform appeared to be&#13;
very limited. In about 2/3 of cities participation in the competition led to substantial acceleration of&#13;
housing reforms (even Krasnoyarsk which declined to participate in the competition continues contacts&#13;
with consultants who carry out technical assistance for the project). In two cities participation in the&#13;
competition was critical to overcome resistance of housing reform opponents. One of the main reasons&#13;
for the success of competition was a unified system of selection criteria which left no room for bargaining&#13;
and lobbying. The pace of changes in project cities is much higher than in general. For example,&#13;
according to rough estimates levels of cost recovery in project cities are more than twice as high as the&#13;
average in Russia.&#13;
15.           At the same time, experience shows that standards for competition should not be limited&#13;
by policy criteria. At least three other factors are critical for city selection process: (i) technical potential&#13;
for investments (which appeared to be very difficult to assess on the basis of information provided by&#13;
cities, without careful examination by project preparation team experts); (ii) budget situation in the city&#13;
(which proved radically changeable during the period of competition); and (iii) implementation capacity&#13;
of city officials which becomes obvious only after series of contacts and visits to the city. These three&#13;
factors should either be included in the competitive procedure or city officials should be informed from&#13;
the very beginning that their cities can be disqualified on the basis of certain reasons which are not&#13;
reflected in selection criteria.&#13;

1.            This annex describes some of the most relevant and recent aspects of energy regulation&#13;
and policy in Russia that pertain to the project. In general, energy in Russia is supplied by both public&#13;
and private enterprises at the national, regional, and local levels. Almost all energy supply and&#13;
distribution enterprises have been privatized into joint-stock companies, with the exception of many&#13;
municipally-owned district heating enterprises (production and distribution) and electricity distribution&#13;
enterprises. In recent years, oil markets in Russia have become more deregulated and competitive,&#13;
although regional monopolies, administrative allocations to some consumers, and export limits remain.&#13;
Electric power, natural gas and coal, on the other hand, have remained dominated by regulated&#13;
monopolies.&#13;
2.            National Monopolies in the energy sector at the national level include Gazprom (for both&#13;
production and transport of gas) and the electric power utility RAO "EES Rossii." Natural monopolies&#13;
a the regional level include regional electric power utilities, regional gas distribution companies, and oil&#13;
pipeline operators. These natural monopolies have been only weakly regulated up until now, and&#13;
institutional capacity for strong regulation is still an important missing ingredient. A federal law&#13;
approved in August 1995 (147-FZ, "On Natural Monopolies") is the latest document regulating these&#13;
natural monopolies. This law allows price regulation, mandatory service to designated consumer groups,&#13;
and mandated minimum service levels when supply shortages exist.&#13;
3.            A federal law passed in April 1995 defines the economic, organizational, and legal basis&#13;
of state regulation of tariffs for electricity and heat (41-FZ, "On State Regulation of Electrical and&#13;
Thermal Energy Tariffs in the Russian Federation"). This law states that tariffs for all heat and electricity&#13;
supplied by commercial organizations are subject to state regulation. The jurisdiction of state organs is&#13;
as follows: (a) municipally owned heat and electricity producers and distribution companies are subject&#13;
to regulation by local government; (b) commercial electricity and heat producers and distribution&#13;
companies at the regional and local levels are subject to regulation by regional energy commissions,&#13;
except if they supply consumers through interregional bulk electricity markets; (c) interregional bulk&#13;
electric power transfers are subject to regulation by the federal energy commission. The basis for setting&#13;
tariffs is cost plus profit, where both reasonable and normal costs must be substantiated in energy&#13;
suppliers' submissions to tariff approval bodies. The Federal Energy Commission is responsible for&#13;
specifying a set of recommended methodologies for determining reasonable tariffs, but the regional&#13;
commissions are not obligated to use these methodologies, and may use their own. Other requirements&#13;
for energy supply enterprises are specified within the law; for example, energy supply and distribution&#13;
enterprises must competitively select equipment suppliers and construction contractors (as verified by the&#13;
regulatory body with jurisdiction of that enterprise).&#13;
4.            Municipal governments regulate municipally-owned utility supply and distribution&#13;
enterprises according to locally-determined regulations. The basis for setting tariffs is also cost plus&#13;
profit, where municipal officials examine the enterprise's cost structure and rule on what is reasonable&#13;
and normal. These enterprises may own and operate district heat production (and peaking) plants, heat&#13;
distribution networks, cold water and sewage systems, and electric power distribution networks. These&#13;
types of utility enterprises are not always municipal, and in some cases the enterprises are privatized or&#13;
owned by the regional electric power utility. In the case of electric power distribution companies, final&#13;
electricity tariffs to consumers are fixed by the regional energy commission, and so the difference&#13;
between the wholesale purchase price and the final selling prices of electricity (total revenues) is not&#13;
subject to control by municipal governments even if the enterprise is municipally owned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

2                                       Staff Appraisal Report: Russia Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project&#13;
5.            Both federal and regional energy commissions are now allowed to be legal entities with&#13;
their own budgets and staff, although regional energy commissions still need substantial training and&#13;
capacity building before they can perform well all of their mandated functions. Funding of regional&#13;
energy commissions and their transformation from unpaid commissions to new legal entities is the&#13;
responsibility of regional administrations, and no such transformations have yet occurred. Funding will&#13;
most likely come from either regional budgets or special energy taxes. Members of regional energy&#13;
commissions are appointed according to procedures adopted at the regional government level. The&#13;
chairman of the regional energy commission must be approved by the federal energy commission. The&#13;
chairman of the federal energy commission is appointed by the president of the Russian Federation.&#13;
6.            Tariffs to residential consumers in municipal-owned buildings for heat and hot water are&#13;
set by municipal governments. It appears that regional energy commissions have jurisdiction in regulating&#13;
heat and hot water tariffs to cooperatives and privately-owned buildings, according to instructions issued&#13;
by the Ministry of Fuel and Energy and the State Committee on Pricing in April 1995. These instructions&#13;
acknowledge, however, that heat and hot water tariffs for residential consumers in cooperatives or&#13;
privately-owned buildings must be the same as for consumers in municipal-owned buildings (according&#13;
to Council of Ministers Decree No. 935, September 1993, "On the Transition to a New System of&#13;
Payment for Housing Services...").&#13;
7.            Residential energy prices have been a moving target in recent years and will continue to&#13;
adjust in the near future, because of supply privatization, price liberalization, cost recovery, and changing&#13;
regulatory jurisdictions and laws. The residential energy price situation in mid-1995 is summarized&#13;
below:&#13;
a.     Electricity. The April 1995 law meant that regional energy commissions can now&#13;
determine residential electricity rates, rather than the federal energy commission. Few&#13;
actions have yet been taken by regional energy commissions to reduce electricity cross-&#13;
subsidies from the industrial to residential sectors. In September 1995, residential&#13;
electricity rates in central European Russia ranged from 15 percent to 50 percent of&#13;
industrial rates, and typically were 20-35 percent of industrial rates. Industrial rates in&#13;
central European Russia varied from 3.8 to 4.4 cents/kWh.&#13;
b.     Heat and hot water. Residential heat and hot water tariffs that city governments charge&#13;
to residents are still substantially below the cost to the city of purchasing the heat and hot&#13;
water (see Annex H on cost recovery). Heat prices in central European Russia (set in&#13;
August 1995) that city govermnents will have to pay to heat suppliers in the winter of&#13;
1995-96 ranged from a low of $13/Gcal in Moscow to a high of $31/Gcal in Vladimir,&#13;
with typical values around $20-25/Gcal.&#13;
c.     Gas. Residential gas prices are now regulated by regional government administrations.&#13;
Residential gas tariffs are fixed monthly charges depending on the end-uses in an&#13;
apartment (stove, hot water heater, etc.), and are still well below the cost of service.&#13;
Local and regional gas distribution companies do not subsidize the gas that they sell to&#13;
residential consumers. Rather, they purchase the gas sold to residential consumers at a&#13;
reduced tariff from the gas transmission company, although the margins (as set by&#13;
regional government administrations) typically do not cover their full cost of service.&#13;
Cross-subsidies occur at the point of transmission (Gazprom and its transmission&#13;
affiliates).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex Q. Energy Regulation and Policy in Russia                                        3&#13;
8.           Policies specifically to promote energy efficiency have proved difficult to enact and&#13;
implement in Russia since 1992. Energy efficiency was the subject of much rhetoric and the goal of&#13;
attempted reforms during the Soviet Period, especially during Glasnost under Gorbachev. But little&#13;
changed in reality. In 1992 a government decree established the Russian Energy Saving Fund (RESF)&#13;
administered by the Ministry of Fuel and Energy. The RESF was charged with financing scientific&#13;
studies, drafting norms and standards, providing equity financing for energy efficiency projects,&#13;
supporting the development of manufacturing capabilities for energy-efficiency equipment and materials,&#13;
and providing preferred credits for small energy efficiency projects. Various domestic mechanisms for&#13;
funding the RESF since that time have been proposed, but none have been enacted. The Bank plans to&#13;
utilize the RESF to prepare and evaluate candidate energy efficiency projects for financing under the first&#13;
Gas Distribution Loan.&#13;
9.           A few energy efficiency policy initiatives have in fact resulted in concrete activities. For&#13;
example, regional energy efficiency funds, administered by the regional government and financed through&#13;
energy taxes, have developed in a few regions of Russia, and these funds were actually collecting and&#13;
dispersing money. But a draft national law on energy efficiency first written in 1992 still has not been&#13;
passed by parliarnent. This law would provide for the collection of capital through taxes and surcharges&#13;
on energy and for investments under the direction of central authorities. Many observers aren't optimistic&#13;
that federal-level legislation will be passed, and think that regional and local laws are much more likely.&#13;
In Moscow for example, new energy-efficient residential building construction standards have been&#13;
enacted. "There are no federal laws on energy efficiency, so we had to make one for Moscow" said an&#13;
official of the Moscow Government Department of Energy Efficiency in an interview in 1994.&#13;
10.          At the direction of the Russian government Council of Ministers, the Ministry of Fuel&#13;
and Energy has been developing an energy policy document in conjunction with the Ministry of Economy&#13;
and other government bodies, entitled "Main Directions of Russian Energy Policy Through 2010."&#13;
Adoption of this document has not yet occurred, but a May 1995 presidential degree (No. 472, "On&#13;
Fundamental Guidelines for Energy Policy and Structural Rebuilding of the Fuel and Energy Complex&#13;
of the Russian Federation Up to the Year 2010") specifies that adoption should take place. The "Main&#13;
Directions..." document establishes national priorities and the conditions for cooperation between the&#13;
federal government, regional governments, local governments, private enterprises, and other&#13;
organizations. Energy efficiency features prominently in this policy document, and energy efficiency in&#13;
buildings is specifically targeted. More recently, the Government has adopted a decree "On Urgent&#13;
Measures Towards Energy Conservation," (#1087, November 2, 1995), and the Duma has passed a law&#13;
on energy conservation, both of which legislate an active state role in the promotion of energy efficiency&#13;
and regulation.&#13;

ANNEX R&#13;
AFFORDABILITY AND COST REcovERY FOR HOUSEHOLDS&#13;
Sulmmary&#13;
1.             In order to anticipate the potential financial and economic consequences of full cost&#13;
recovery in Russia's housing sector, a statistical model on household incomes and housing expenditures&#13;
was developed, upon which the analysis in this annex is based. Although there are drawbacks to the&#13;
analysis due to the unavailability of updated data and uncertainty regarding the future macroeconomic&#13;
environment in Russia, the conclusion of the analysis is that full cost recovery in the housing sector will&#13;
require additional reforms in the areas of housing and income policy as well as a campaign to reduce&#13;
housing costs through measures to conserve energy use in residential buildings.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.            In 1994, the Russian Government announced that full cost recovery in the housing sector&#13;
would be achieved by 1998, with local authorities required to raise tariffs associated with housing costs&#13;
(i.e., utilities and maintenance costs) according to their own schedules (see also Table H-5). Some cities&#13;
have reached 30 percent cost recovery in 1995; considering the fact that cost recovery in the sector in&#13;
1993 was only 5 percent, this signifies meaningful progress. However, such drastic changes beg the&#13;
question of what the real costs will be under full cost recovery, for both the population and the local&#13;
governments responsible for providing housing allowances to them.&#13;
The Statistical Model&#13;
3.            Under the assumption that the current reform program in the housing sector is achieved&#13;
by 1998, this model attempts to estimate possible outcomes regarding the following:&#13;
a.    the average level of housing expenditures;&#13;
b.     percentage of the population that will be eligible for housing allowances; and&#13;
c.    the overall fiscal burden on local governments to finance these allowances.&#13;
4.            These questions will be addressed using household income and consumption data from&#13;
the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Household Survey (RLMS)I, and estimates of the economic costs&#13;
for maintaining typical Russian housing.&#13;
Caveats&#13;
5.            The RLMS is recognized as the best source of raw sample data available on income and&#13;
consumption patterns across Russian households; at the same time, there are caveats that should be taken&#13;
into account, in particular: income data in the RLMS are probably downwardly biased; income&#13;
1/     The RLMS was a nationally representative household survey covering more than 6,300 households located in 21&#13;
regions of the Russian Federation, administered jointly by Goskomstat and the World Bank in period 1992-94. The survey&#13;
contains a set of indicators regarding households' incomes, expenditures (including those on housing), as well as the families'&#13;
housing conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                       Staff Appraisal Report: Russia Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project&#13;
distribution has most likely changed dramatically since 1992, the last year for which data is available;2&#13;
and there is no reasonable information regarding regional variation in real housing costs, and thus, the&#13;
average costs of European Russia has been used as a substitute.&#13;
6.           In consideration of these three caveats, all estimates must be considered preliminary as&#13;
the quality of the data is not sufficient for conclusive policy recommendations. The results are also very&#13;
sensitive to the assumptions made about incomes and costs.&#13;
The Framework of the Model: Assumptions and Parameters&#13;
7.            The assumptions used in the model are as follows:&#13;
a .    Cost-recovery increases according to the Government's recommended schedule: 60&#13;
percent by 1996, 80 percent by 1997, and 100 percent by 1998.&#13;
b .    Real incomes in 1996-98 increases at a rate of 6 percent annually.3&#13;
c .    All preferential tariffs for housing are eliminated and households do not run any payment&#13;
arrears.&#13;
In addition, the policy parameters incorporated into the model are as follows:&#13;
a .   Maximum allowed housing expenditure. This is the maximum allowable proportion of&#13;
expenditures on housing as a percentage of household income determined by the&#13;
Government. This maximum was set at 15 percent for 1995-97 and 20 percent thereafter&#13;
(Table H-5).&#13;
b.    Maximum subsidizable housing space per household. According to Russian regulations,&#13;
only expenditures on housing which fall under locally approved social norms are eligible&#13;
for housing allowances.  Although these vary according to the particular local&#13;
government and across regions, in this model, the following norms were used: 30 square&#13;
meters of living space for the first member of the household and 15 square meters per&#13;
each additional member of the household.&#13;
Results of Modelling the Basic Scenario&#13;
8.            The results of the model show that it will be challenging to achieve full cost recovery by&#13;
1998 (Table R-1) without a deepening of reforms and other measures to increase household incomes&#13;
and/or reduce housing costs. Even with increases in real income by almost 20 percent between 1996 and&#13;
1998, almost half the households would be eligible for housing allowances. Although average housing&#13;
expenditures amount to about 12 percent of total household income by 1998, given the high degree of&#13;
income differentiation, the size of housing allowances would most likely be high-on average, more than&#13;
2/     Later rounds of RLMS do not contain data on household housing conditions.&#13;
3/    This assumption is based on the medium-term outlook for the Russian economy in the World Bank Country Economic&#13;
Memorandum, 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex R. Affordability and Cost Recovery for Households                                             3&#13;
a third of average unit housing costs. As a result, local budgets would have to cover about 16 percent&#13;
of total housing costs in the form of housing allowances.'&#13;
9.             The administrative, political and economic costs of a housing allowance program of such&#13;
magnitude could be excessive, however. According to the model, the percentage of households eligible&#13;
for housing allowances will exceed the level of 25 to 30 percent, the threshold beyond which marginal&#13;
fiscal gains might be questionable. The costs of administering an allowance program of such a scale in&#13;
a weak institutional environment may reach 100 percent of the value of benefits.5&#13;
Recommended Policy Reforms and their Results&#13;
10.            Within the given scenario, the following policy options might be considered by the&#13;
Government to achieve full cost recovery according to their proposed schedule:&#13;
a.     Encourage investments in energy savings. A 20 percent drop in utilities expenditures&#13;
is equivalent to a 25 percent increase in real incomes. This would lead to a drop in the&#13;
number of housing allowance recipients to 30 to 35 percent.&#13;
b.     Accelerate the liberalizaton of wage/income policy. The Government has already made&#13;
a number of crucial decisions in this sphere6, however, the efficacy of these decision will&#13;
depend on the pace at which they are implemented. Wage/income policy reform has a&#13;
direct impact on increasing the affordability of housing under full cost recovery for the&#13;
population.&#13;
C.     Increase the maximum  share of housing expenditures to total income from 20 to 25&#13;
percent. This will cut the number of eligible recipients of housing allowances up to 50&#13;
percent. However, this will be the most difficult to implement, both politically and&#13;
financially. Although spending 20 to 25 percent on housing in developed market&#13;
economies is normal where rents/mortgages cover capital costs of the homeowner, in&#13;
Russia, spending on recurrent costs alone might exceed 20 to 25 percent of income, thus&#13;
crowding out investments in new housing.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
11.            Despite the lack of updated data, achieving full cost recovery in the housing sector by&#13;
1998 will be difficult unless additional policy reforms in housing, income, and energy savings are&#13;
introduced. The EHDP will ease some of the major constraints currently hampering the path to full cost&#13;
recovery by supporting housing divestiture, investments in housing retrofits, and institutional reforms in&#13;
the sector. A strong effort must be made to replicate these measures nationwide.&#13;
4/     This means that the net budget gain for the local budgets compared to 1995 would be about 55 percent of total housing&#13;
costs. Budgets covered 70 percent of housing expenditures in 1995 through direct subsidization of the sector, and about 16&#13;
percent would be expended as allowances by 1998.&#13;
5/     Refer to the 1995 Russian Country Economic Memorandum for more information.&#13;
6/     These include accelerating the pace of housing divestiture and other social assets, reducing implicit housing subsidies,&#13;
eliminating excess wage taxes, and accelerating substitution of non-cash and in-kind benefits with conventional'wages and social&#13;
transfers.&#13;

ANNEX S&#13;
NET BENEFITS AND CosTs TO ENTERPRISES, CITIES, AND HOUSEHOLDS&#13;
1.           As energy prices are raised at both the city-gate and apartment level, enterprise, city, and&#13;
household budgets have come under increasing stress. Given the number of variables (e.g., pace of cost&#13;
recovery, energy price increases, divestiture, etc.) it is difficult to construct a single "without project"&#13;
scenario. Assuming that policy reform and efficiency investments would proceed much slower without&#13;
the project, it is estimated that the project will decrease total housing expenditures in local budgets,&#13;
enterprises, and households by one-third. This reduction will derive from two sources. Roughly one-half&#13;
of the savings is expected to come from policy and institutional changes supported under the project that&#13;
will reallocate payment responsibility for housing and utility services, alter incentives, and thereby&#13;
increase efficiency in various activities. These include the development of competitive maintenance&#13;
markets, increase in cost recovery, privatization and the formation of condominium associations, and&#13;
metering of actual consumption of heat and hot water. These will be captured by the city, enterprises,&#13;
and households. The other half of the savings from the project is the direct return to energy efficiency&#13;
investments (see Box S-1). These will be captured by the city and the households. Funds will be&#13;
invested in retrofit of about a third to a half of the existing housing stock in the cities and this will reduce&#13;
by one-quarter to one-third the consumption of utility services in retrofitted buildings.&#13;
2.            Enterprises that divest housing will lose tax deductions in an equivalent amount up to 1.5&#13;
percent of their turnover. This means that many enterprises will get no net financial gain from&#13;
divestiture, and the enterprise sector as a whole is expected to gain only about 0.5 percent of GDP from&#13;
the divestiture process in the short term. However, individual enterprises that provide alot of housing&#13;
will get substantial net benefits-up to 70 percent of gross expenditures on housing in some cases.&#13;
3.            To the extent that restructuring will require enterprises to focus their financial and other&#13;
resources on their core business, it is useful to look at the gross costs to the enterprise sector of providing&#13;
housing.     A   special  survey  of  24  Russian  manufacturing   enterprises  from   ten&#13;
different cities was conducted in December of 1994. These enterprises varied substantially in size and&#13;
in the magnitude of their housing burden. On average, each enterprise in the sample was responsible for&#13;
maintaining 70 multi-apartment buildings with as many as 4,000 apartments in them. More than 7&#13;
percent of enterprises' labor force was involved in this activity either full-time or more than half of their&#13;
working time. Full employment in the provision of both the housing and other social services (health,&#13;
child care, recreation, entertainment) amounted to almost 18 percent of total labor. Total housing costs&#13;
denominated in per employee terms amounted to 20 percent of average cash wages, while the full housing&#13;
and social costs made up 35 percent of average wages. This provides a useful indicator of the scale of&#13;
wage distortions which will be eliminated as a result of divestiture. Since the total payroll costs for&#13;
Russian industry are almost equal to the value of the gross profit, these data might be also considered as&#13;
a measure of gross financial benefits for enterprises participating in divestiture.&#13;
4.            Under a without-project scenario in which cost recovery is increased only slowly, the&#13;
municipal budgets will be the main beneficiaries of proposed changes in housing policy. Encouraging&#13;
implementation of full cost-recovery in housing will transfer the main burden of municipal housing&#13;
financing from local governments to tenants. It is estimated that the share of local budgets spent on&#13;
housing will be reduced from 25-40 percent in the without-project scenario to 7-15 percent with the&#13;
&#13;

project.' Because the main budget savings under the project derive both from investments and from&#13;
policy changes, and because proposed investments have a high rate of return, the cities will get this&#13;
dramatic reduction in budget expenditures at a relatively low price: during the amortization period for&#13;
the project-financed investments, net debt service payments will not exceed 2-3 percent of budget&#13;
revenues, since about two-thirds of the debt-service costs will be recovered from tenants.&#13;
Box S-1. Mechanisms for Flncial Returns to Cities from Retrofits.&#13;
Investments that reduce utility costs of operating buildings translate into financial returns to city&#13;
budgets through three prmar typ  of mechanisms outlined below. For further background, refer to&#13;
Annex I on Stakeholder Analysis, and Anne Q on Russian Energy Regulation and Policy.&#13;
Financial retums from city-produced beat and bot water, In cases of heat produced by a&#13;
municipal heating company, the muniipal heating company will reduce its fel consumption in response&#13;
to decreased heat and hot water consumption at the building level. The city will pay the municipal heating&#13;
company for actual heat delivered to buildings, as measured by building-level heat meters. As energy&#13;
consumption is lowered, the payments the city makes wlll also decrease, freeing city budget resources for&#13;
loan repayment and other needs. This mechanism has three requirements: (a): building-level heat meters&#13;
need to be istalled (Included in Phase I of the project); (b) agreements between the city and the municipal&#13;
-heain$ company need to be modified, so that the city pays according to actual consumption at the building&#13;
rathed than according to a design or theoretical consumption estimate, as Is the case now; (c) the&#13;
organizational capacity for periodic meter readings is required. None of these requirements presents any&#13;
special problem,: since the city admWiantion has the authority and resoures to saomplish all tree. At&#13;
the city meeting in October 1995, all cities said they planned to implement billing based on meter readings&#13;
(in 0one city 'the next mornig' after meters are inslled). Since there is only one set of meters per&#13;
apartment b n, the manpower requirements for monthly meter reading are quite minimal. Some of&#13;
the cities ae aleady unrk_ing mering installations in all heat distribution substations. It is anticipated&#13;
that district eating companies will themseves install beat meters on the output of heat production plants&#13;
so that they can better monitor and reduce distition system losses.&#13;

I/     The amount of public expenditures on housing under the "with-project" scenario will depend on the demand&#13;
for housing allowances and the pace at which residents can take over responsibility for capital repairs.&#13;

5.            Under an alternative without-project scenario in which fiscal pressures force cities to&#13;
increase cost recovery rapidly, the project mitigates the burden of increased cost recovery for households,&#13;
and residents will capture a greater part of the financial gains under the project. With strong progress&#13;
toward full cost recovery in the sector and no decreases in operating costs, housing expenditures as a&#13;
share of the total household consumer expenditures would increase from 2 percent in 1994 to 14-15&#13;
percent by 1998. Such an increase is necessary to raise efficiency within the housing sector, accelerate&#13;
the development of the housing market, and free budgetary resources for basic infrastructure and social&#13;
services. As households' responsibility for financing recurrent costs increases, households will benefit&#13;
proportionally more from the increase in energy efficiency of their housing and other policy and&#13;
institutional changes supported under the project. All else being equal, project interventions are expected&#13;
to reduce housing costs for households by 20-25&#13;
percent compared to the without-project scenario,&#13;
depending on the pace at which cost recovery is&#13;
phased in, household income levels, and the       Box S-2. Inpact on Real Elousehold Income&#13;

interventions  to  contain  costs-such   as               positie impact on household incomes,&#13;

Alternatively, municipal enterprises who find&#13;
themselves cut out of a guaranteed job of&#13;
maintaining housing as a result of the competitive tenders may find alternative work installing some of&#13;
the energy efficiency retrofits.&#13;
7.     Tables S-1 and S-2 present the estimates of net benefits from the project on a per-apartment basis&#13;
for local budgets and households. The tables compare the net cash flows under the project with the "non-&#13;
project" scenario as described above in para. 4, i.e., with a slow increase in cost recovery up to only 50&#13;
percent and therefore lower budget spending on housing allowances (Table S-1). This table shows that&#13;
the net present value of the cash flow for city budgets is highly positive even if the cities repay the loans&#13;
without recourse to cost recovery from the tenants for the retrofit costs.&#13;
&#13;

8.     Table S-2 demonstrates that the net increase in housing expenditures of tenants will be driven by&#13;
various factors that push household expenditures in opposite directions. Annual housing expenditures of&#13;
tenants would increase by 7.5 percent of their annual incomes if full cost recovery would have been&#13;
achieved without the project. Building retrofits under the project will decrease this potential loss by 3.5&#13;
percent, i.e. household expenditures would increase by only 4 percent of annual income under the project&#13;
instead of 7 percent in this without-project scenario, based on the energy efficiency retrofits alone. In&#13;
addition, incremental housing allowances supported under the project, amounting to about 1 percent of&#13;
average household income, reducing the net increase for households to 3 percent. On the other hand,&#13;
if depreciation charges for the retrofits are introduced, this will increase the cost for tenants by about 1.9&#13;
percent of household income.&#13;

            Russian Federation - Enterprise Housing
            Divestiture Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The primary objective of the Enterprise
            Housing Divestiture Project is to accelerate and make
            sustainable the divestiture of enterprise housing. This will
            help enterprises focus their limited financial and
            managerial resources on restructuring core business
            activities to meet the challenges of an open-market economy.
            To ensure that divestiture is feasible for cities in the
            short term and sustainable over time, the project will
            support reforms that push the ownership, financing and
            management of the housing stock into the private sector,
            which is an integral aspect of the economic transition
            occurring in Russia. Secondary objectives of the project
            include a wider range of reforms as follows: 1) housing
            privatization; 2) cost recovery of housing maintenance and
            utility fees from tenants; 3) targeted housing allowances;
            4) competitive bidding maintenance of housing; and 5)
            improved energy efficiency in divested housing. The project
            has four components: 1) housing divestiture from
            enterprises, associated general housing reforms and housing
            allowances for vulnerable households; 2) building retrofits,
            including metering, energy efficiency investments and
            limited capital repair; 3) upstream investments in the
            divested utility networks; and 4) project management.
