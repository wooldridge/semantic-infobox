establish a long-term least-cost power sector investment&#13;
program, and carry out an electricity and thermal energy pricing&#13;
study and implement its recommendations;&#13;
(b)  Thermal Plant Rehabilitation Program (about US$344.8&#13;
million). This component includes equipment, services and&#13;
technical assistance to be provided to RENEL to: (i) rehabilitate&#13;
about 1,445 MW of its existing thermal generation capacity;&#13;
(ii) convert about 200 MW of its existing lignite-based thermal&#13;
capacity to coal use; and (iii) reduce the pollution impact of&#13;
thermal plants; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
(c)  Corporate Restructuring Program (about US$14.8 million).&#13;
This component will provide technical assistance to RENEL to:&#13;
(i) streamline the utility to focus on electricity and thermal&#13;
energy generation, transmission, and distribution; (ii) create&#13;
cost/profit centers for the generation plants and distribution&#13;
subsidiaries; (iii) design and implement management systems&#13;
(for operation and maintenance management, financial and cost&#13;
accounting, human resources, materials management, and&#13;
corporate planning system); (iv) improve metering, billing and&#13;
collection system; (v) design hydropower plant, and transmission&#13;
and distribution network rehabilitation programs; (vi) retire old&#13;
and inefficient thermal units; and (vii) improve environmental&#13;
management and occupational health and safety.&#13;
Benefits and Risks:               The quantifiable benefits arise from: (a) avoided cost of&#13;
replacing about 1,445 MW of thermal capacity to be&#13;
rehabilitated (which otherwise would have to be retired before&#13;
year 2000); (b) lignite to hard coal conversion to curtail&#13;
uneconomic transportation of lignite; (c) improvement in fuel use&#13;
efficiency, and increased unit availability and production of&#13;
electricity and thermal energy. The economic rate of return on&#13;
the physical components is about 21 %. Cost savings through&#13;
managerial and operational efficiency improvements are also&#13;
expected. In addition, the Project will lead to improvement in&#13;
the environment through reduction in air pollution.&#13;
The main risk associated with the proposed Project relates to&#13;
possible failure to move forward in the implementation of the&#13;
sector reform and the corporate restructuring program . To&#13;
address this, some important upfront actions have been taken.&#13;
They include: (a) the appointment by GoR of a high level Inter-&#13;
Ministerial Committee to oversee the Study of Options of Long-&#13;
term Power Sector Structure, and the initiation of the Study; and&#13;
(b) issuance of a Statement of Power Sector Policy which&#13;
includes the Government's declaration to separate the nuclear&#13;
power activities from RENEL into an independent public entity.&#13;
In addition, a review would be conducted each year to assess&#13;
progress in achieving the development objectives of the project&#13;
and to consider need for further policy actions and/or project&#13;
restructuring.&#13;
A second concern is the possible inability of RENEL to mobilize&#13;
the funding required for the project in a timely manner. As&#13;
regards counterpart funding, this risk is mitigated by the upfront&#13;
tariff increases already implemented and the measures already in&#13;
place and to be instituted to eliminate arrears, as well as the&#13;
measures to be implemented under the Project to improve billing&#13;
and collection. Close monitoring of performance is planned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
As regards cofinancing, GoR and RENEL have committed to&#13;
secure co-financing by December 31, 1995 and there has been&#13;
satisfactory progress in this regard.&#13;

ROMANIA&#13;
POWER SECTOR REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
I. MACROECONOMIC SETTING AND THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
A. Macroeconomic Setting&#13;
1.1   Following the overthrow of the communist regime in December 1989, the new Government of&#13;
Romania (GoR) initiated a reform program aimed at transforming Romania into a market economy.&#13;
The reform program included price liberalization, redefinition of the role of the Government to give&#13;
public enterprises more autonomy, the promotion of a commercial orientation in public enterprises by&#13;
reclassifying them into "regies autonomes" (RAs) and "commercial companies" (CCs), with the intent&#13;
that the latter be privatized; and an ongoing program of enterprise privatization.&#13;
1.2   This reform program was supported by the IMF with a Standby Arrangement (SA) in early&#13;
1991 and by the Bank with a Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL Loan No. 3481-RO), following the&#13;
adoption of a stabilization program. Much of the reform agenda initiated to establish laws,&#13;
institutions, and policies of the market economy is now complete, including the establishment of a&#13;
two-tier system of banking, reform of the role of the Government and introduction of a modem tax&#13;
system, the freeing of most prices and progress towards the elimination of subsidies, the adoption of a&#13;
tariff-based trade regime with low tariffs, and the development of a framework for privatization of&#13;
state-owned enterprises. There has been considerable expansion of private sector activity, including&#13;
in agriculture. Presently the Bank is preparing a Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan&#13;
(FESAL), which is designed to assist the Government in its plans to reform the banking system,&#13;
deepen the privatization process, accelerate the restructuring of government-owned enterprises and&#13;
promote financial discipline.&#13;
1.3    A major turnaround of the economy occurred in 1993 with a positive 1 % growth in GDP,&#13;
the first time since 1988. This was followed by about 3.4% growth in GDP in 1994. The main&#13;
contributors to the growth in 1994 have been agriculture and the services sectors; industry also&#13;
registered a modest growth. The share of industry has declined to 40% in 1994 from 54% in 1989,&#13;
and that of agriculture has risen to about 24% from 19.6% in the 1980s, while trading activities have&#13;
almost doubled since 1989. In 1996-2000, GDP is projected to grow at a trend rate of about 5% per&#13;
year. Agriculture and services are expected to be the leading growth sectors. Industry is expected to&#13;
expand in the light manufacturing and export oriented branches, and to contract in the uncompetitive&#13;
metallurgical and chemical branches. As a result of the structural changes, the intensity of energy use&#13;
in the economy is expected to decline.&#13;
B. The Energy Sector&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.4   The energy sector has been shaped by the past industrialization policies. It is a vital sector of&#13;
the economy. It accounted for 46% of total industrial sector investment in 1990, and for nearly&#13;
100% in 1992-1994 due to the nuclear power development program (see Annex 2.3). As a result of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
the high energy intensity of the economy and the continued declines in known reserves of oil and gas,&#13;
energy imports absorbed about 26% of export revenues in 1993 despite a depressed level of demand.&#13;
Energy Resources&#13;
1.5    Romania has considerable reserves of primary energy (natural gas, lignite and coal, oil and&#13;
hydropower potential). Reserves of natural gas are about 510 million tons of oil equivalent (TOE).&#13;
Proven reserves of lignite are about 600 million TOE; hard coal about 330 million TOE; and oil&#13;
about 200 million TOE. The total hydropower potential is about 40 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year, of&#13;
which 12 TWh per year is already developed. Uranium deposits exist but the level of reserves is not&#13;
published. However, the government's nuclear power development program is based on using it as&#13;
the main source of fuel. Oil shale and geothermal reserves are known to exist, but their extent is&#13;
unknown. Renewable energy resources in bio-mass and fuel wood are abundant, while geothermal,&#13;
wind and solar energy are of relatively less significance. Levels of reserves of commercial energy&#13;
resources are provided in Annex 1. 1.&#13;
Institutional Setting&#13;
1.6    As part of the economic reform measures introduced in 1990, the energy sector was&#13;
reorganized by establishing separate autonomous state enterprises, Regies Autonomes (RAs), for the&#13;
production and supply of energy products and commercial companies (CCs) for support services and&#13;
activities. This enabled the Government to separate policy and regulation from operational functions,&#13;
and to bring about accountability and commercial orientation to the energy sector. The RAs and CCs&#13;
have been formed out of the departments of the former ministries. RAs are state holding companies&#13;
for enterprises considered strategic by the Government of Romania such as electric power, oil, natural&#13;
gas, lignite, coal, etc. The CCs are joint stock companies which have been established under the&#13;
commercial law.&#13;
1.7   Sector Organization: The sector is still predominantly state-owned under the supervisory&#13;
responsibility of the Ministry of Industries (Mol), which formulates policy and strategy. Operational&#13;
responsibility rests with the RAs and the CCs. The main RAs and CCs are:&#13;
(a)    Romanian Electricity Authority (RENEL), which is responsible for production,&#13;
transmission and distribution of electricity, as well as production and bulk&#13;
transmission of heat;&#13;
(b)    Regie Autonome for Natural Gas (ROMGAZ), which is responsible for the&#13;
exploration, production, transmission, and distribution of natural gas;&#13;
(c)    Regie Autonome for Petroleum (PETROM), which is responsible for exploration,&#13;
production, and supply of crude oil, transmission of associated natural gas to&#13;
ROMGAZ;&#13;
(d)    Regie Autonome for Lignite (RAL), which is responsible for the production and&#13;
marketing of lignite;&#13;
(e)    Regie Autonome for Hard Coal (RAH), which is responsible for the production and&#13;
marketing of hard coal;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
(f)    Romanian Refinery Company (RAFIROM) is a holding company of the oil refineries;&#13;
it is responsible for the allocation of crude oil to the refineries, management and&#13;
coordination of refinery activities; and&#13;
(g)    Romanian Petroleum Distribution Company (PECO), which is responsible for the&#13;
distribution and retail sale of petroleum products.&#13;
Energy Pricing&#13;
1.8    Policy and Price Adjustments: After the 1989 revolution, in line with its policy of price&#13;
liberalization under the macroeconomic reform program, the Government initiated actions to raise&#13;
energy prices to import parity levels. As a result, within a period of about two years, significant&#13;
real increases of the order of 10-15 fold were made to most energy prices, except natural gas and&#13;
household fuels. The traditional non-tradeables, lignite and low grade local coal, were priced at&#13;
parity with tradeable hard coal on a heat equivalent basis. Under the SAL that was approved in June&#13;
1992, the GoR agreed that:&#13;
(a)    crude oil, and petroleum product prices will be maintained at international levels&#13;
through periodic adjustments for exchange rate and international price changes;&#13;
(b)    lignite, local coal, electricity and thermal energy prices will be maintained in real&#13;
terms through periodic adjustments for exchange rate changes;&#13;
(c)   the price of natural gas to non-household consumers will be raised monthly by&#13;
$4/thousand cubic meters (103m3) from about US$60/103m3 until parity with the FOB&#13;
Mediterranean price of fuel oil (1 % sulphur content) on heat equivalent basis is&#13;
achieved; and&#13;
(d)   the gradual elimination of the subsidies to households for energy.&#13;
Despite the persistent high inflation, the conditionalities were substantially met by the Government,&#13;
first in February 1993 when all subsidies to households on energy, with the exception of thermal&#13;
energy and natural gas, were eliminated and later in April 1994, which enabled the release of the&#13;
second tranche of the SAL. Prices were adjusted to import parity levels in June 1995 in fulfillment of&#13;
the requirement under the SAL. Table 1.1 compares prevailing prices with import parity. Annex 1.2&#13;
shows the movements in energy prices since November 1990. A separate discussion of electricity and&#13;
thermal energy prices is provided in paragraphs 2.20-2.25.&#13;

Sector Issues, Government Policy and Strategy&#13;
1.9    Issues: The main issues in the energy sector are.&#13;
(a)     high inefficiency of energy use due to old and inefficient technologies, and  to the&#13;
dilapidated state of assets, compounded by poor operations and maintenance;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
(b)    excessive vertical integration of enterprises, absence of a competitive environment,&#13;
and inadequate regulatory systems;&#13;
(c)   lack of economic criteria in planning and investment selection;&#13;
(d)    over-employment, and operational inefficiencies;&#13;
(e)    weak financial position of sector entities, and the accumulation of inter-enterprise&#13;
arrears; and&#13;
(f)    environmental pollution.&#13;
1.10   Government Strategy: The government strategy to address these issues has been to:&#13;
(i) introduce a sector reorganization to separate policy and strategy from operational functions,&#13;
followed by present plans to allow for the participation of public and private independent operators in&#13;
a competitive environment; (ii) implement energy price reforms to align prices with economic costs;&#13;
(iii) critically screen the energy sector investment program to limit it to the highest priority&#13;
investments; and (iv) develop a program for the rehabilitation of the existing energy supply&#13;
infrastructure. The Governrent should now develop long-term programs for fundamental&#13;
restructuring of the sector. This would involve the implementation of further policy and institutional&#13;
reforms.&#13;
1.11   The short and medium term measures are aimed at conservation in primary energy use,&#13;
reduction in losses, improvement in the quantity and reliability of energy supplies to final consumers,&#13;
and reducing the sector's pollution impact on the environment. The long-term measures would bring&#13;
about the break-up of sector monopolies, downsize enterprises and operations, and introduce&#13;
competition with the appropriate legal and regulatory systems to enhance the participation of&#13;
independent operators, both public and private, in the sector. In addition, they are expected to bring&#13;
about improvements in corporate governance, and institute modern management, accounting and&#13;
financial systems. Finally, ongoing privatization programs in the industrial sector and production&#13;
shifts away from heavy industry, in response to market forces, should result in progressive reduction&#13;
in the energy intensity of the economy and increased end-use efficiency.&#13;
1.12   The implementation of the strategy by the Government has been hampered by lack of&#13;
consensus on the proposed policy changes, and limited local expertise, especially regarding&#13;
management and financial systems.&#13;
1.13   Bank Assistance Strategy: The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Romania is&#13;
presented in the Memorandum of the President (MOP) dated March 14, 1994 on the Petroleum Sector&#13;
Rehabilitation Project. It is aimed at supporting the GoR to achieve macroeconomic stability and&#13;
implement systemic reforms, particularly in creating the institutions fundamental to the operation of&#13;
the market economy. This includes establishing property rights, privatization, tax and tariff reforms,&#13;
establishing a modern financial system, strengthening the social safety net, developing legal&#13;
institutions, and improving public administration, continuing the process of sectoral restructuring and&#13;
adjustment in the industrial, agricultural and energy sectors; and enhancing long-term growth and&#13;
development prospects through projects in education, social welfare, and infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
1.14   Within the framework of the CAS, the Bank's assistance to the energy sector is geared to&#13;
promote fundamental reforms designed to support its rehabilitation, improve its efficiency, and&#13;
eventually attract private investments to the sector. Loan 3723-RO approved by the Bank in 1994 is&#13;
aimed at providing such support in the upstream petroleum sector. The proposed Power Sector&#13;
Rehabilitation and Modernization Project will be directed to the power sector, to assist the&#13;
Government to develop and implement a sound policy and strategy to achieve these objectives.&#13;
Future lending to the power sector is planned, and would be contingent upon satisfactory progress in&#13;
implementing the policy reforms to be initiated under the proposed Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
II. THE POWER SECTOR&#13;
A. Institutional Setting&#13;
2.1    The Ministry of Industries (Mol), created in 1990, has overall responsibility for the power&#13;
sector. Mol is divided into 4 departments each headed by a Secretary of State, reporting to the&#13;
Minister of Industries. The Secretary of State for Energy has the principal role in setting the policies&#13;
for the power sector, (in addition to petroleum and other primary energy) while the Secretaries of&#13;
State for Restructuring, Strategy and Reform make sporadic interventions. The Secretary of State for&#13;
Energy has under him a director general for electric power, oil and gas, who is responsible for policy&#13;
and strategy formulation, and for regulation of the sector.&#13;
2.2    Other GoR Ministries involved in the power sector are: (a) the Ministry of Finance (MoF)&#13;
which, through its Pricing Office, sets electricity prices, and is represented on the Administrative&#13;
Councils of each of the RAs; (b) the Ministry of Water Resources, Forestry and Environment&#13;
Protection (MAPPM), which has a role in controlling environmental pollution in the country; and&#13;
(c) the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MMPS), which is concerned with worker health and&#13;
safety issues, and with the social impact of any significant staff reductions resulting from&#13;
reorganizations; and (d) GoR's Council for Coordination, Strategy and Economic Reform, (CCSER)&#13;
which is responsible for economic restructuring.&#13;
2.3    Responsibility for public electricity and thermal energy generation, transmission, and&#13;
distribution is with RENEL. RENEL was created in 1990 from the former Ministry of Electrical&#13;
Energy in accordance with Law 15/90. RENEL inherited the traditional role of production and&#13;
supply of electricity and thermal energy, as well as detailed engineering design and construction,&#13;
foreign trade, research and development (R&amp;D), and nuclear power development functions. By now,&#13;
some of the construction and foreign trade departments have been spun off into independent&#13;
commercial companies. At the same time, the nuclear fuel processing enterprise, ROMAG, and the&#13;
enterprise producing heavy water for the Cernavoda nuclear power plant were fully integrated into&#13;
RENEL. In addition to RENEL, some large state-owned industrial plants also own co-generation&#13;
plants and sell electricity and thermal energy directly to other industries, and to municipalities.&#13;
RENEL Organization and Management&#13;
2.4   In line with the recommendations of a corporate restructuring study carried out with the help&#13;
of foreign consultants (financed by EU-PHARE), RENEL was reorganized in late 1992 to give it a&#13;
corporate form. Corporate policy-making is vested in a eleven member Board of Administration&#13;
(Board of Directors), of which the President of RENEL is the Chairman. In addition, the Board of&#13;
Administration comprises representatives of the Government, the financial institutions, the fuel&#13;
suppliers, and consumers. Day-to-day affairs are the responsibility of RENEL Management,&#13;
comprising the President (designated as Director General) and five Deputy-Director Generals - one&#13;
each for: generation, transmission and distribution, nuclear power group, strategy and development,&#13;
finance, and human resources. Structurally, RENEL comprises the headquarters, thirty-six branches,&#13;
(each managing a power station), the Cernavoda nuclear power subsidiary, the fuel and heavy water&#13;
processing subsidiaries, and forty-two electricity transmission and distribution subsidiaries divided&#13;
along the lines of the forty-two administrative Judets (Counties). The organization structure of&#13;
RENEL is shown in Annex 2.1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
2.5    The reorganization of RENEL separates, in theory, the corporate policy-making from&#13;
company management and also from operations. However, in practice, there is little separation&#13;
between corporate policy-making and management, because a number of vice-presidents are also&#13;
members of the Board of Administration. In addition, the present policy attempts to centralize&#13;
decision making. This is not desirable since RENEL is too large to be run efficiently in a centralized&#13;
way. Moreover, in a number of important policy matters RENEL still depends on decisions taken at&#13;
the government level. However, the operational units (the thirty-six generation plants and forty-two&#13;
transmission and distribution units), which are called subsidiaries, are profit centers and are required&#13;
to maintain records accordingly and this provides a basis to promote decentralization.&#13;
RENEL Personnel and Staffing&#13;
2.6    Since 1990, RENEL has been implementing a program of gradual reduction in its labor force.&#13;
By end-1994, a total reduction of about 48% (from about 200,000 to about 105,000) in the labor&#13;
force had been achieved, mainly through the separation of some of the construction and repair&#13;
subsidiaries into independent public commercial entities (para. 2.4), but also through reductions in&#13;
unskilled labor. By end-1995 the labor force is expected to be further reduced to about 99,700.&#13;
2.7    Compared to international norms, RENEL is still overstaffed. The ratio of installed power&#13;
capacity (MW) per thousand employees in RENEL is 198 (compared, for example, to 308 in Turkey,&#13;
603 in Poland or 770 in EdF-France). The overstaffing is mainly in the labor category (skilled and&#13;
unskilled) which account for 75 % of the staff. Many of these staff (more than 50%) are engaged in&#13;
support activities, such as detailed engineering and design, research and development, repairs and&#13;
construction works and manufacturing which are normally not part of a power utility.&#13;
Institutional Reform Measures&#13;
2.8    GoR and RENEL have decided to address the above structural and overstaffing problems in&#13;
RENEL by implementing a corporate restructuring program. The program, to be implemented under&#13;
the proposed Project, would involve:&#13;
(a)    separating nuclear activities into a different entity, reporting directly to Mol;&#13;
(b)    retiring old and inefficient units to reduce operating costs and working capital;&#13;
(c)    spinning off of construction, repair, and manufacturing subsidiaries and the&#13;
engineering and technical institutes into independent commercial companies;&#13;
(d)    creating cost/profit centers based on viability and to correspond to the various&#13;
operations (generation, transmission and distribution) in each of the generation plants&#13;
(or a group of plants to ensure viability), a separate cost/profit center for the&#13;
transmission network, and several cost/profit centers for the distribution activities;&#13;
(e)    designing and implementing a long-term Human Resources plan, including programs&#13;
to reduce excess staff;&#13;
(f)    implementing management tools, such as financial accounting, cost accounting,&#13;
materials management, corporate budgeting planning systems; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
(g)    adopting financial performance criteria, first at the headouarters level and gradually at&#13;
the cost/profit center level.&#13;
B. Power System Operations and Performance&#13;
Existing Facilities&#13;
2.9    Romania's installed power generating capacity is 21,808 MW, of which RENEL's total&#13;
installed power generating capacity is 20,281 MW (93%). The remaining generating capacity is&#13;
owned by industries, municipalities and independent rural cooperatives. In the RENEL system,&#13;
hydropower capacity accounts for about 28%; lignite and coal-fired for about 42%; and oil and gas-&#13;
fired for about 30%. Approximately 38% of RENEL installed thermal capacity (5,080 MW out of&#13;
14,829 MW) is in cogeneration, i.e. combined heat and power (CHP) plants. The structure of&#13;
installed power generating facilities in the country is provided in Annex 2.2.&#13;
2.10   Romania has extensive interconnected power transmission and distribution networks of total&#13;
length of about 592,000 kin, and total transformer capacity of about 172,000 MVA. The networks&#13;
encompass the entire country such that accessibility to electricity is nearly 100%. RENEL operates&#13;
about 74% of the network, comprising the following transmission voltages - 750 kV, 400 kV, 220&#13;
kV, and 110 kV; and the subtransmission voltage of 60 kV; and about 50% of the distribution&#13;
network in the 20 kV, 10 kV, 6 kV, 1 kV, and 400 kV volts. The rest of the distribution network is&#13;
operated by industrial plants and rural cooperatives in their designated supply areas.&#13;
2.11   RENEL operates five regional load dispatching centers, including the national center in&#13;
Bucharest for management of the system load, and for international electricity exchanges. The&#13;
Romania transmission network is linked by tie-lines with Ukraine at 750 kV and 400 kV; two lines at&#13;
1 10 kV with Moldova; one 220 kV line with Hungary; one 750 kV, two 400 kV, and one 220 kV&#13;
lines with Bulgaria; and one 400 kV, and four 110 kV lines with the former Yugoslavia.&#13;
2.12   A significant characteristic of Romania's power system is its high base-load requirements,&#13;
primarily due to the large industrial consumption. In 1994, the base load requirement (in winter)&#13;
amounted to 78% of the system gross peak demand of 8,600 MW. The co-generation and the other&#13;
thermal units are operated to meet base load requirements, and the hydropower units, complemented&#13;
by imports are used to meet peaking requirements. Although the installed capacity is more than twice&#13;
the peak demand, RENEL is unable to meet its peak and has had to resort to imports of electricity&#13;
(Table 2.1). The constraints in meeting demand are primarily due to operational problems, which are&#13;
discussed below.&#13;
Generation&#13;
2.13   Thermal Plants: RENEL is barely able to obtain about 6,000 MW of dependable continuous&#13;
electric power output during the winter season from its installed thermal capacity of 14,602 MW due&#13;
to the poor operating state of the thermal plants, which is mainly attributable to: (a) plant design and&#13;
construction deficiencies, including use of poor grade construction materials; (b) inadequate&#13;
maintenance; (c) use of low grade fuels, which often do not meet plant design specifications; and&#13;
(d) improper operations and management practices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
2.14   As a consequence of the above, most thermal plants, especially the lignite fired units, suffer&#13;
from: (a) frequent and prolonged outages resulting in low availability rates (of about 30% on the&#13;
average); (b) low fuel use efficiencies ranging between 18% and 24%, compared to design levels of&#13;
28%-34% (about 46% for the co-generating units); (c) lower power output than rated design capacity,&#13;
with capacity factors (utilization of available capacity) of about 32%, which is very low; and&#13;
(d) degraded and poor performing pollution control equipment. If the current operation and&#13;
maintenance practices continue, estimates indicate that the dependable firm thermal capacity would&#13;
decline to about 3,500 MW by the year 2000.&#13;
2.15   Hydropower Plants: RENEL's hydropower power plants are in a slightly better operating&#13;
condition than the thermal plants. However, the hydropower plants are not operated in accordance&#13;
with an optimal regime, because thermal generation is cut back in autumn (to conserve fuel for the&#13;
winter) and the storage reservoirs are discharged during these times (prior to the winter season) to&#13;
also meet the base load. This renders the hydroplants incapable of meeting the peaking requirements&#13;
during winter. A number of the main plants/units, some of which have been in operation for the past&#13;
20 years, need urgent rehabilitation.&#13;
2.16 Nuclear Power: The first unit of a 5x700 MW nuclear power station at Cernavoda is planned&#13;
for commissioning towards the end of 1995, after many delays. The continuation of investments in&#13;
additional units, for which some of the infrastructure has been constructed, is subject to economic&#13;
justification. The technology is based on CANDU-6 nuclear reactor of Canadian design, using&#13;
natural uranium as fuel and heavy water as a coolant and moderator (which would be supplied&#13;
locally), and a General Electric Turbogenerator. Engineering services and project management are&#13;
being provided by a consortium of Atomic Energy of Canada (AECL), and Ansaldo-Impianti of Italy,&#13;
which will also continue with operational management services for 18 months after commissioning to&#13;
train Romanian staff in the operation of the station. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)&#13;
has conducted separate inspections of the construction of Unit 1, and has found the works satisfactory.&#13;
A post-commissioning inspection by IAEA is expected in 1996. Further discussion is provided in&#13;
Annex 2.3.&#13;
Transmission and Distribution Netivorks&#13;
2.17   The power networks also suffer from inadequate maintenance due to lack of spares and aged&#13;
equipment, especially, at the medium and low voltage levels. RENEL transmission system has&#13;
adequate carrying capacity for the foreseeable future, but several areas need upgrading and&#13;
reinforcement. The load dispatching system equipment is old (1970 vintage) and would cease to be&#13;
functional in the next five years. RENEL distribution network suffers from high technical losses&#13;
(about 15%) due to overloading of substations and lines, as they were not designed to meet recent&#13;
increases in consumption at the low voltage level. In addition, inadequate metering, billing and&#13;
collection practices are causing additional (non-technical) losses.&#13;
Technical and Operational Efficiency Improvement Measures&#13;
2.18   RENEL's and GoR's immediate priority should be the improvement of the technical and&#13;
operational efficiency of the existing power system. In this regard, RENEL should:&#13;
(a)    undertake economic rehabilitation of the existing thermal power plants, reduce their&#13;
pollution impact and implement measures to improve technical operations and maintenance;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
(b)    accelerate the mothballing and retirement of inefficient generation units (of about&#13;
3,000 MW by year 2000), thereby reducing operating costs (including personnel) and&#13;
working capital (fuel inventories and spares);&#13;
(c)    undertake measures to ensure the adequacy and quality of its fuel supplies, which&#13;
would require building the necessary handling and storage infrastructure and develop&#13;
arrangements for advance procurement of fuels to build up stocks for the winter&#13;
season;&#13;
(d)    design and implement a rehabilitation program for the hydro electric power plants;&#13;
and&#13;
(e)    design and implement rehabilitation and reinforcement programs for the transmission&#13;
and distribution networks, and modernize the load dispatching system.&#13;
In the medium term, it is expected that the GoR will implement a competitive environment with&#13;
private sector participation in generation, which would provide the incentives for further efficiency&#13;
improvements.&#13;
2.19   The physical components of the proposed Project are aimed at financing the rehabilitation of&#13;
RENEL's thermal plants; and at helping the design of rehabilitation programs for hydropower plants,&#13;
and transmission and distribution networks. GoR has already agreed with the Bank to undertake a&#13;
Fuel Options Policy Study under the Petroleum Sector Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3723-RO), which&#13;
would provide the inputs to develop an optimal strategy for meeting RENEL's fuel needs.&#13;
C. Electricity and Thermal Energy Pricing&#13;
Electricity Pricing&#13;
2.20   As part of the price liberalization program, and in accordance with the agreement with the&#13;
Bank under the SAL (para 1.8), since 1990 electricity prices have been set and maintained in dollar&#13;
terms to reflect the cost of imported electricity, as a proxy for the opportunity cost of supply from the&#13;
RENEL system. However, there have been long periods of decline in real electricity price levels,&#13;
which necessitated periodic large increases to bring the tariffs back up to the targeted levels.&#13;
RENEL's tariff structure does distinguish between various voltage levels, and provides for time-of-&#13;
day and for seasonal tariffs. RENEL also applies a demand charge and a separate energy charge for&#13;
customers (mainly industries) where a specific power level is contracted by the customers. The tariff&#13;
structure is provided in Annex 2.4.&#13;
2.21   RENEL tariff regime has the following drawbacks:&#13;
(a)    residential customers pay only 32% of the price of other low voltage customers, and&#13;
about 46% of the price to industrial customers, even though the cost of supply to the&#13;
residential customers is the highest;&#13;
(b)    RENEL's cost-of-supply information, either in financial or economic terms, is very&#13;
weak and unreliable. Consequently, it is not possible to: (i) allocate costs between&#13;
heat supply and electricity supply; (ii) distinguish between generation, transmission&#13;
and distribution costs; or (iii) provide for the right categorization by customer&#13;
characteristics, especially at the medium and low voltage levels;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
(c)    RENEL lacks adequate metering equipment to ensure the accurate application of&#13;
demand and energy charges in accordance with the tariff structure; and&#13;
(e)    as a consequence of economic restructuring, RENEL's load curve is assuming a&#13;
double hump shape - some industries are no longer running multiple shifts and as a&#13;
result the morning peaks have become high relative to the high evenings peaks, which&#13;
have also become sharper. However, RENEL is applying its peak tariffs (as in the&#13;
old days) only in the evening times.&#13;
To address the issue under (a), at negotiations, it was agreed that GoR will progressively reduce the&#13;
level of cross-subsidization of electricity price paid by households over a period of four years from the&#13;
date of this Agreement, so as to ensure that by December 31, 1999, all such subsidies shall have been&#13;
eliminated (para 6.2 p9).&#13;
2.22   In March 1994, GoR reviewed its electricity pricing policy with the Bank, in the context of&#13;
the release of SAL's second tranche. As a result of the review, agreement was reached with the Bank&#13;
to set the prices to reflect an average of US$50/MWh equivalent (including 18% VAT). In addition,&#13;
GoR agreed to:&#13;
(a)    prevent deterioration in the average level, by automatically adjusting the prices to an&#13;
average of US$50/MWh when, on the basis of the average exchange rate prevailing in&#13;
the preceding month, the average price had fallen to or below US$46.25/MWh&#13;
equivalent; and&#13;
(b)    review and make adjustments, as necessary to the electricity prices of US$50/MWh,&#13;
whenever the international prices of fuels used by to RENEL are changed.&#13;
Over time, the agreement under SAL has been found to cause some problems. On the one hand, it&#13;
has some times required price adjustments during the winter season, which caused a negative social&#13;
reaction. In addition, since the formula required maintaining the price in dollar terms, from time to&#13;
time concerns were raised about the management of the exchange rate during the winter season,&#13;
during which the resistance to price adjustments was perceived to be stronger. The Bank consulted&#13;
the Fund on these issues and to overcome them, at negotiation the Government agreed to maintain&#13;
electricity prices corresponding on average to not less than the equivalent of US$50/MWh (including&#13;
VAT), through periodic adjustments to the consumer electricity prices in accordance with a timetable&#13;
acceptable to the Bank (para.6.2 (g)). It was further agreed that the first such increase, after the one&#13;
already implemented in June 1995, will take place in April 1996 followed by another one in&#13;
November 1996. Thereafter the Government will adjust tariffs as required twice a year, in April and&#13;
in August. These dates have been selected to facilitate the timing of the increases. Furthermore, in&#13;
order to ensure that RENEL's finances will not be negatively affected, RENEL and the Govermnent&#13;
have also agreed to the financial covenants which are discussed in para. 4.22, which provide for&#13;
further tariff increases if needed. At present, the Government is in compliance with its commitments.&#13;
Furthermore, the Goverment has agreed to adjust pursuant to guidelines acceptable to the Bank the&#13;
consumer electricity prices if changes to the level prevailing on the date immediately preceding the&#13;
adjustment of consumer electricity prices shall have occurred in the international market prices of the&#13;
main fuels (coal, natural gas, and fuel oil) used by RENEL for power generation (para 6.2 (g)).&#13;
Presently the tariff covenants are in compliance; the latest increase of 15% took place in June 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
2.23     In addition to maintaining the levels of electricity prices as above, GoR will carry out an&#13;
Electricity and Thermal Energy Pricing Study with the help of experienced consultants, and&#13;
implement the study's recommendations to provide a sound economic basis for setting electricity and&#13;
thernal energy prices that would promote efficiency, ensure sector viability, provide incentives for&#13;
the participation of private operators in the sector and take account of social and equity concerns. At&#13;
negotiations, the GoR agreed that (i) by September 30, 1995, or such later date as the Bank may&#13;
agree, it will appoint consultants, whose qualifications and terms of reference shall be satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank, to carry out an electricity and thermal energy pricing study; (ii) promptly upon its&#13;
completion, discuss with the Bank the findings and the recommendations of the study; and (iii)&#13;
according to a timetable acceptable to the Bank provide to the Bank a satisfactory program for the&#13;
implementation of the actions agreed as a result of said study and discussions with the Bank (para 6.2&#13;
(h)). This study should be completed by September 1998, since it must draw upon the findings of the&#13;
least-cost power generation development study that is also to be carried out under the project (para.&#13;
2.37 (b)). These covenants are to be complemented by a financial covenant that requires adjustment&#13;
of the average tariff level beyond the level set under SAL if needed to achieve a self-financing ratio&#13;
of not less than 30% of RENEL's capital investments (para 4.22). At present, the average tariff level&#13;
required under SAL is adequate to achieve the degree of self-financing proposed above, and the&#13;
analysis of RENEL financial prospects indicates that it would allow for an acceptable financial&#13;
evolution (paras. 4.19 - 4.22).&#13;
Thernal Energy Pricing&#13;
2.24   RENEL sells thermal energy at bulk prices to the various municipalities and large industrial&#13;
consumers. Retail prices are set by the Government in collaboration with the municipalities. Since&#13;
1990, thermal energy prices have been increased by about 20 fold to non-residential consumers, and&#13;
about 8 fold to residential consumers. Although, the actual cost of service is unknown, the price to&#13;
industrial consumers does cover variable operating costs, including fuel. Price to residential&#13;
customers is significantly below cost of service, necessitating Government budget subsidies which are&#13;
paid to the municipal heat distribution entities. The current price to industrial and commercial&#13;
customers is about US$19/gigacalorie, including VAT, compared to US$7.3/gigacalorie to residential&#13;
customers, who are exempted from VAT.&#13;
2.25   The structure of bulk heat supply prices is relatively simple (see Annex 2.4). It comprises a&#13;
maximum demand charge based on the delivered pressure, and energy charges. However, due to lack&#13;
of appropriate metering, sales are billed on energy. A major issue affecting heat pricing is the&#13;
allocation of production cost between electricity and heat from co-generating sources. In addition, the&#13;
cost structure of transmission and distribution is not known. Furthermore, there is no distinction in&#13;
prices to reflect cost of supply by season, even though there are significant differences in seasonal&#13;
supply costs.&#13;
D. Demand for Electricity and Heat&#13;
Past Electricity Consumption and its Characteristics&#13;
2.26   Intensity of electricity use is very high compared to other countries, both because of the high&#13;
proportion of industrial consumption, and the inefficient use by industry. Consumption peaked in&#13;
1989 at 71.4 TWh following about 2.3% average annual growth rate since the early 1980s, but has&#13;
since declined to about 43 TWh in 1994. Until 1989, industry accounted for 75-78% of total&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
consumption due to the priority given to industry in the allocation of electricity, households accounted&#13;
for 6-8%, and the remainder went to other sectors, i.e agriculture, transport and communications, and&#13;
services. However, by 1994, due to the structural changes in the economy that resulted in a decline&#13;
in industrial output, the lifting of restrictions on household use, and the steep price increases to&#13;
industry, industry's share in consumption declined to about 64%, and household consumption rose to&#13;
about 15% of total consumption.&#13;
2.27   Annual maximum  power demand ranged between 10 TW and 11.3 TW in the 1980s, but&#13;
declined to about 7.9 TW in 1994, for the reasons given above. The demand profile shows a high&#13;
load factor (ratio of average to peak energy), with annual load factor of about 75%, and daily load&#13;
factors on winter work days of nearly 90%, indicative of the dominance of industry in consumption.&#13;
Table 2.1 summarizes past supply and consumption trends. The characteristics of the demand are&#13;
illustrated by the daily load curves and the annual load duration curve in Annex 2.5.&#13;

Forecast Electricity Demand&#13;
2.28   The Bank has prepared forecasts of demand for electricity up to 2005, which are based on the&#13;
assumption of declining electricity use intensity in the productive sectors due to the changing structure&#13;
of the economy. For households, the forecasts take into account the effects of the lifting of the limits&#13;
on use of electricity by households, the increasing use of electricity for space heating due to the&#13;
failures of the district heating system, and the effects of expected increases in personal incomes with&#13;
return to steady economic growth as from 1996 onwards, as well as the expected increases in&#13;
household tariffs. The demand forecasts are tentative, since the economy is still in the midst of a&#13;
transformation process, and the structure that will emerge is only starting to take shape.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
2.29   The net effect of the above is that future electricity demand is unlikely to exceed the 1990&#13;
levels until 2003-2005. Table 2.2 shows the electricity demand forecasts. Annex 2.6 provides past&#13;
and forecast electric energy and power balances.&#13;

Past Supply and Consumption of Thermal Energy&#13;
2.30  In 1980-90, total heat production from thermal plants ranged between 150-170 thousand&#13;
teracalories p.a. depending on the severity of the winter season. RENEL accounted for about 40% of&#13;
total supply from its CHP and hot water boiler plants. The rest was provided by industrial self-&#13;
generation, and by peaking hot water boilers operated by the municipalities. RENEL sells process&#13;
steam and thermal energy at bulk transmission to large industries, and to the municipal distributing&#13;
companies, who operate distribution network in their respective municipalities.&#13;
2.31   Forecast Demand for Thermal Energy: Similar assumptions as for electricity demand are&#13;
made in forecasting the future demand for heat by the productive sectors. Demand by households&#13;
takes into account the combined effects of increased urbanization and new housing developments.&#13;
Similarly, projected demand is not expected to reach the 1990 level until after 2005. Forecasts,&#13;
summarized in Table 2.3, include losses in the primary and secondary distribution systems.&#13;

E. Power Sector Investment&#13;
Mol's Investment Program&#13;
2.32   The sector investment program for the period 1995-2000 originally prepared by Mol and&#13;
RENEL envisaged a total expenditure over the period of about US$7.9 billion (January 1994 prices),&#13;
including about US$2.2 billion for the nuclear power development program, which is not realistic.&#13;
Since the above amount is not economically justified, and furthermore cannot be funded, the GoR&#13;
has:&#13;
(a)    scaled down the proposed sector investment program in conventional power facilities&#13;
drastically (to about US$2.32 billion (Annex 2.7)), and agreed at negotiations to&#13;
establish priorities on the basis of a least-cost investment program to be prepared with&#13;
the help of consultants (para 2.37 (b));&#13;
(b)    decided that RENEL's medium term investments will be limited to rehabilitation&#13;
investments (generation, thermal and hydro; transmission and distribution networks;&#13;
load dispatching); and environmental improvement (new ash disposal systems and&#13;
deposits, land reclamation, and monitoring), and the completion of high priority&#13;
unfinished hydro and the thermal power projects at advanced stages of completion,&#13;
since at the current tariff levels RENEL can only invest about US$300 million per&#13;
year on average and still maintain a reasonably satisfactory financial position (para&#13;
4.22);&#13;
(c)    agreed to meet the remaining local cost to complete Unit 1 of Cernavoda, the Nuclear&#13;
Power Station, as well as moderate expenditures needed to preserve the works already&#13;
completed on Units 2-5, from the state budget;&#13;
(d)    agreed not to undertake new investments for Units 2-5 of the Cernavoda Nuclear&#13;
Power Station until their justification is established on the basis of a system-wide&#13;
least-cost analysis mentioned in (a) above;&#13;
(e)    agreed to continue to implement measures underway for the future interconnection&#13;
with the Western European Power Interconnection System (UCPTE), and to improve&#13;
the ties with neighboring countries to enhance Romania's participation in a wider&#13;
regional power market, which would provide for greater security and reliability of&#13;
supply to meet the demand in the most economic manner; and&#13;
(f)    agreed to implement measures to reduce the environmental impact of the power&#13;
sector.&#13;
Agreement on the power sector's medium-term investment program has been reached, and an annual&#13;
consultation with the Bank on the program will ensure that future changes are justified and financially&#13;
viable (para 4.18). For the longer term, the proposed least-cost development program will serve as a&#13;
basis for investment decision making (para 2.37 (b)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
F. Private Sector Development&#13;
2.33   The Government recognizes that in order to implement the medium term investment program,&#13;
and for the longer term needs of the sector, substantial investments will be necessary. Hence, given&#13;
the constraints on public finances, there is no option but to attract private investments, including&#13;
foreign investments, to the sector. This approach should also spur efficiency improvements through&#13;
competitive pressure. Therefore, the GoR plans to implement reforms to the sector organization and&#13;
its legal and regulatory framework to create conditions for competition, and the participation of&#13;
private operators. In this regard, GoR has agreed to:&#13;
(a)    carry out a study of options of the long-term structure for the power sector (the&#13;
Options Study) with the assistance of consultants (para. 2.37 (c)). The Options Study,&#13;
which is being funded by the United States Agency for International Development&#13;
(USAID), has already been launched, it would be completed by September 1996 and&#13;
its implementation would begin immediately thereafter. Terms of reference for the&#13;
Options Study were agreed at negotiations; and&#13;
(b)    reform the legal and regulatory framework for the sector; for this purpose, the GoR&#13;
has been preparing a draft electricity law, which it will complete following its&#13;
decision on the long-term structure of the power sector, and thereafter submit to&#13;
Parliament for its consideration no later than December 31, 1996. The law is&#13;
expected to provide for competition in the sector, demonopolization, transparent&#13;
regulations, and conditions for private sector participation in power activities. In&#13;
addition, the law is expected to: (i) provide for creation of an independent national&#13;
transmission company that would deal evenhandedly with publicly-owned, as well as&#13;
private generators and distributors; (ii) permit a wide range of schemes for private&#13;
sector participation, both local and foreign in power generation (self producers,&#13;
cogenerators, and independent producers) and eventually in distribution; (iii) permit&#13;
partial or total privatization of government-owned power generation and distribution&#13;
facilities; (iv) provide for the creation of an independent regulatory body, and the&#13;
principles of its operation; and (v) define principles and procedures for setting&#13;
electricity prices and for transmission wheeling charges, when these would be&#13;
applicable, and for the development of power purchasing agreements.&#13;
G. The Bank's Role and Strategy&#13;
The Bank's Role&#13;
2.34   The role of the Bank in the Romania power sector dates from July 1974 when the first loan of&#13;
US$60 million equivalent (Loan 1028-RO) was made to the Government for the First Turceni Power&#13;
Project for the construction 4x330 MW lignite-fired power station and associated transmission&#13;
facilities. This was followed by three additional loans for the construction of the Mare-Retezat&#13;
Hydropower Stations, the Second Turceni Power Project of 4x330 MW, and a mix of thermal and&#13;
hydropower plants in the Government's 1980-83 power development investment program. By 1985&#13;
when the Government decided to repay all Bank loans, Bank financial assistance to the sector had&#13;
reached US$300 million equivalent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
2.35   The Bank has been working closely with the Romanian authorities in the identification of&#13;
issues, delineation of the strategy and in the analytical work to identify the policy choices that the&#13;
Government needs to adopt. The Bank has also assisted in the preparation of the terms of reference&#13;
for the various studies (for example: for electricity and thermal energy pricing, least-cost investment&#13;
program and the Options Study), as well as in the preparation of a draft electricity law.&#13;
2.36   The strategic and policy choices discussed in the previous paragraphs represent, in the Bank's&#13;
view, a comprehensive set of actions to address the critical issues faced in the power sector.&#13;
However, the approval of the set of actions and, even more importantly, their implementation&#13;
requires the involvement of other GoR agencies, such as the Ministries of Finance, Industries, Justice,&#13;
Environment, and Social Protection. The Government has confirmed its long-term policy objectives&#13;
for the power sector in a Statement of Power Sector Policy (Annex 2.8). A strategy document to&#13;
implement the Government's policies for the sector has also been furnished to the Bank.&#13;
2.37   Furthermore, in order to ensure that the development objectives of the proposed Project are&#13;
achieved in a timely manner, the GoR has agreed to:&#13;
(a)   i) promptly after the commissioning of the first unit of the Cernavoda nuclear power&#13;
station, inform the Bank of the commission of said unit; (ii) over a period of 18&#13;
months after the commissioning of said unit, take all necessary measures, agreeable to&#13;
the Bank, to separate all nuclear power activities from the power activities of the&#13;
Borrower; and (iii) no later than 20 months after the commissioning of said unit,&#13;
establish an independent public entity to carry out such nuclear power activities) (para.&#13;
6.2 (e));&#13;
(b)   i) by September 30, 1995, or such later date as the Bank may agree, appoint&#13;
consultants whose qualifications and terms of reference shall be acceptable to the&#13;
Bank to carry out a long-term least-cost power generation development study; and (ii)&#13;
promptly upon its comnpletion, discuss with the Batik the findings and recommendations&#13;
of said study (para. 6.2 (i));&#13;
(c)   i) appoint consultants, whose qualifications and terms of reference shall be&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank to carry out a study of options of long-term structure for the&#13;
power sector, and ensure its completion by September 30, 1996, or such later date as&#13;
the Bank may agree; ii) no later than three months after the conclusion of the&#13;
assessment of the options of the long-term sector structure (Phase I of the study), or&#13;
such later date as the Bank may agree, inform the Bank of its decision on the selected&#13;
long-term structure for the power sector in Romania; (iii) complete a draft electricity&#13;
law for submission to the Romanian Parliament no later than December 31, 1996; iv)&#13;
no later than three months after the submission to the Government of the consultants'&#13;
final report on the study, provide to the Bank an action program satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank for the implementation of the long-term sector structure; and v) implement the&#13;
action program (para. 6.2 (b)); and&#13;
(d)   review annually with the Bank, no later than October 31 of each year, the progress in&#13;
the implementation of the Power Sector Strategy and the policy framework, and take&#13;
corrective actions and policy measures to ensure the achievement of the strategic&#13;
objectives stated in the Power Sector Strategy (para 6.2 (d)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
The Bank's Strategy&#13;
2.38   The proposed Project is in line with the Bank's power sector policy. The strategy of the Bank&#13;
is to promote and support fundamental reforms to bring about effective competition and participation&#13;
of private operators in the sector, while bringing about efficiency improvements in the development&#13;
and operations of the power sector as quickly as possible. The proposed Project will also serve to&#13;
prepare the ground through studies for continuing the restructuring in a second phase, which is&#13;
expected to be supported by a follow-up project.&#13;
2.39   The Bank will adhere to two main principles in assisting Romania's power sector. First,&#13;
because of the large financing requirements, the Bank will work with other multilateral and bilateral&#13;
cofinanciers to prepare, finance, and implement projects in the sector. Second, the institutional&#13;
reforms will be deepened under each operation. Experience has shown that due to difference in the&#13;
way in which country stakeholders view sectoral and institutional reforms, even agreed actions are&#13;
sometimes not implemented as expected or are delayed. Therefore, there is a need not only to agree&#13;
on a long-term strategy for the power sector, but also to spellout the progress in the reforms expected&#13;
for the Bank's continued involvement in the sector. Accordingly, a follow-up project in the power&#13;
sector would be contingent upon satisfactory implementation of the policy reforms and in the&#13;
corporate restructuring of RENEL supported under the proposed Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
3.1    The objectives of the proposed project are to: (a) support the government's program to reform&#13;
the power sector in accordance with its overall economic reform objectives; (b) meet the demand for&#13;
electricity and thermal energy in an economic manner by rehabilitating thermal generation capacity;&#13;
and (c) lay the foundation for the future development of the sector in an institutionally, economically,&#13;
and environmentally sustainable manner.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
3.2    The proposed Project would comprise:&#13;
(a)    Power Sector Reform Program (about US$4.3 million), under which technical&#13;
assistance will be provided to Mol to: (i) carry out and implement a Study of Options&#13;
of Long-Term Structure for the Power Sector; (ii) develop and implement an&#13;
appropriate legal and regulatory framework for the sector to attract private&#13;
investments to the sector; and (iii) establish a long-term least-cost power sector&#13;
investment program, and carry out and implement an electricity and thermal energy&#13;
pricing study;&#13;
(b)    Thermal Plant Rehabilitation Program (about US$344.8 million), which includes&#13;
equipment, services and technical assistance to RENEL to: (i) rehabilitate about 1,445&#13;
MW of its existing thermal generation capacity; (ii) convert about 200 MW of its&#13;
existing lignite-based thermal capacity to coal use; and (iii) reduce the pollution&#13;
impact of thermal plants; and&#13;
(c)    Corporate Restructuring Program (about US$14.8 million), under which technical&#13;
assistance will be provided to RENEL to: (i) streamline the utility to focus on&#13;
electricity and thermal energy generation, transmission, and distribution; (ii) create&#13;
cost/profit centers for the generation plants and distribution subsidiaries; (iii) design&#13;
and implement management systems (for operation and maintenance management,&#13;
financial and cost accounting, human resources, materials management, and corporate&#13;
planning systems); (iv) improve metering, billing and collection system; (v) design&#13;
hydropower plant, and transmission and distribution network rehabilitation programs;&#13;
(vi) retire old and inefficient thermal units; and (vii) improve environmental&#13;
management and occupational safety and health.&#13;
The Power Sector Reform Program was discussed in paragraph 2.33, and RENEL Corporate&#13;
Restructuring Program is outlined in paragraphs 2.8 and 4.4. The Thermal Plant Rehabilitation&#13;
Program is briefly discussed below. Detailed description of the units that are to be rehabilitated is&#13;
provided in Annex 3.1.&#13;
Thermal Plant Rehabilitation Program&#13;
3.3    The Rehabilitation Program was prepared on the basis of a detailed technical inspection and&#13;
feasibility study of rehabilitation of eleven representative thermal generating units in RENEL system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
The inspections and the feasibility study were carried out by a consortium of international&#13;
consultants. The criteria for selection of the representative unit candidates were based on age, unit&#13;
size, type of technology and operational condition. The methodological approach called for the&#13;
determination of the level of rehabilitation that was economically justified as part of the least-cost&#13;
solution to meeting demand.&#13;
3.4    The inspection enabled the determination of costs and benefits associated with three levels of&#13;
rehabilitation: Level 1 for 7 years life extension; Level 2 for 15 years life extension; and Level 3 for&#13;
25 years life extension. To determine the appropriate level of rehabilitation for each representative&#13;
unit candidate, a lifetime cost analysis was undertaken. The analysis was based on comparison of&#13;
alternatives over a reasonably long period (25 years), to bring the alternatives to a commnon basis.&#13;
The alternatives considered were: (a) no rehabilitation or replacement; (b) rehabilitation to level 1; (c)&#13;
rehabilitation to level 2; and (d) rehabilitation to level 3. As a result of the analysis, an optimum&#13;
medium term (1994 - 2000) thermal plant rehabilitation program was developed. The program is to&#13;
be implemented in two phases, Phase I and Phase II. A select number of units of total installed&#13;
capacity of about 1,445 MW at six power stations would be rehabilitated in the Phase 1. In addition,&#13;
about 200 MW of lignite based capacity at two power stations will be converted to coal usage.&#13;
3.5    The equipment and systems to be rehabilitated under the program will include: boiler plant&#13;
and combustion system, turbine-generator plant, electrostatic precipitators, fuel feed system, water&#13;
treatment system, controls and instrumentation. The program will also include the improvement of&#13;
operation and maintenance practices and environmental management, and development of safety&#13;
procedures for the power plants personnel. The Rehabilitation Program will result in increased&#13;
availability of plant; improved fuel use efficiency; increase in output: extension of the useful life of&#13;
the plant; pollution reduction; and increased worker health and safety.&#13;
3.6    The Rehabilitation Program is a complex undertaking and will require technical know-how&#13;
and project management skills that are currently unavailable in RENEL. Therefore, RENEL will hire&#13;
an experienced consulting firm as the "Engineer" for the Rehabilitation Program. The Engineer's&#13;
responsibility will be to provide RENEL with engineering, procurement, and project management&#13;
services. The Engineer's services will be financed by the proposed Bank loan and the process of&#13;
selection of the "Engineer" from a shortlist of firms/consortia, from whom proposals were invited, is&#13;
currently in progress by RENEL. The appointment of the Engineer in a timely manner is critical to&#13;
the success and timely implementation of the Rehabilitation Program.&#13;
C. Project Costs&#13;
3.7    The detailed estimate of the total cost of the proposed Project is provided in Annex 3.2, and is&#13;
sunmmarized in Table 3.1. It will amount to about US$363.9 million, including physical and price&#13;
contingencies of US$65 million (about 18% of total costs), and taxes and duties of about US$24&#13;
million (7% of total costs). Direct and indirect foreign exchange costs amount to US$241 million&#13;
(about 66% of total costs) and local costs amount to about US$122.9 million equivalent (about 34%&#13;
of total cost). The estimates of base costs for the technical assistance components were developed by&#13;
the mission, based on similar projects in Romania and in other eastern European countries. The costs&#13;
of the Rehabilitation Program are consultants' estimates. A physical contingency level of 15% has&#13;
been included in the physical components of the proposed Project.&#13;

D. Project Financing&#13;
3.8    The financing plan for the proposed Project, summarized in Table 3.2, calls for financing the&#13;
local costs of the Rehabilitation Program from RENEL's internal cash generation. The foreign costs&#13;
of the Rehabilitation Program, and costs of the Reform Program and RENEL Corporate Restructuring&#13;
Program will be financed by a combination of loans and grants from multilateral and bilateral&#13;
agencies. The foreign financing is expected to be provided by EIB for US$23.1 million equivalent&#13;
(about 7% of total financing requirements) for the Bucharest South Units 3 &amp; 4 (2x 100 MW); EBRD&#13;
for US$ 54.4 million equivalent (about 15% of total financing requirements) for the Palas Units 1 and&#13;
2 (2x5OMW), Braila Unit 1 (210 MW), Brazi Unit 8 (200MW), and part of the associated&#13;
Engineering and Project Management Services, and the Metering and Billing and Collection Program;&#13;
and the proposed Bank loan of US$110 million (30% of total financing requirements) for Isalnita Unit&#13;
7 (330 MW); Deva Unit 1 (210 MW), part of the Project Management and Engineering Services, the&#13;
RENEL Corporate Restructuring Program, the Power Plant Maintenance System Overhaul and the&#13;
Environmental Monitoring System. The grant portion of the financing package, which will finance&#13;
part of the technical assistance, will be from EU-PHARE for US$3.6 million equivalent, and from&#13;
USAID for US$2.9 million. Contacts are under way with the Export-Import Bank of Japan (JEXIM)&#13;
for US$44.9 million equivalent (about 12% of total financing requirements) for financing for the&#13;
Deva Unit 2 (210 MW) and for the lignite to coal conversion of lasi and Suceava.&#13;

3.9    RENEL ought to be able to finance the requisite local costs from its internal cash generation&#13;
provided that it improves its collection record and limits its investments to the agreed levels (Chapter&#13;
IV). As regards foreign cost, USAID and EU-PHARE have confirmed their willingness to finance&#13;
the identified technical assistance components. EIB and EBRD confirmed their participation in the&#13;
project financing in 1995, while JEXIM has been approached by RENEL, and is evaluating the&#13;
information received from the Government as well as other financing requests by the Government.&#13;
JEXIM participation, if and when confirmed, is likely to be under parallel financing to be&#13;
administered by the Bank. EIB and EBRD's participation will be under parallel financing&#13;
arrangements, as they will be financing separate units for rehabilitation under their own procurement&#13;
guidelines. A consequence of these financing arrangements is that it is not necessary that the entire&#13;
financing package for the project be in place now. At negotiations, GoR and RENEL undertook to&#13;
secure all the cofinancing needed by December 31, 1995 or such later date as the Bank may agree&#13;
(para 6.2 (a)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
E. Procurement&#13;
3.10   RENEL has had limited exposure to international procurement in general, and to Bank-&#13;
financed procurement in particular, though it has purchased spare parts funded by Loan 3363-RO&#13;
(Technical Assistance and Critical Imports Project). The close working collaboration between&#13;
RENEL and the Consultant to be selected to provide engineering and project management services&#13;
(para 3.6) and active Bank supervision would seek to strengthen RENEL capabilities in international&#13;
and Bank procurement. The procurement arrangements are designed to take into account the&#13;
participation of multiple financiers with their respective procurement guidelines (para. 3.9) as well as&#13;
RENEL project management capabilities. The Rehabilitation Program (comprising equipment,&#13;
materials, services and technical assistance), for which most of the procurement activity will take&#13;
place, will be procured under a turnkey approach. One general contractor will be selected for each of&#13;
the thermal power plants/units to be rehabilitated to provide the supply, erection and commissioning&#13;
services and guarantees/warranties for performance. This approach will save time and effort (that&#13;
would otherwise need to be sper.t by RENEL and its Engineer on the tendering process and on&#13;
coordination between suppliers of different equipment, materials and services). For the turn-key&#13;
contracts to be financed by the Bank, contractors will be selected through pre-qualification procedures&#13;
and ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
3.11   The project elements, estimated costs and the procurement arrangements for those elements&#13;
financed by the Bank are summarized in Table 3.3. Goods and services to be financed through&#13;
cofinancing are shown under the non-Bank Financed (NBF) column. Four packages (Annex 3.3) in&#13;
total value of about US$321.7 million will be procured under the ICB procedures of the Bank and&#13;
those of the other cofinanciers. All goods, equipment, and services to be financed from the Bank&#13;
loan proceeds would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement, dated&#13;
january 1995. Romanian goods for supply under ICB procedures of the Bank would receive a&#13;
preference in bid evaluation of 15% of the CIF price or the prevailing customs duty applicable to&#13;
non-exempt importers, whichever is less, in accordance with World Bank Guidelines. For&#13;
procurement of Bank-financed goods, equipment, and services, country-specific standard bidding&#13;
documents will be used. For supply, erect, and turnkey contracts, the Bank's Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents, including amendments as of loan signing date would be used. Engineering consulting&#13;
and technical assistance services financed by the Bank will be selected in accordance with the&#13;
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by the World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency" (August 1981), and by using the Bank's Standard Contract Form for Employment&#13;
of Consultants. The process of selecting the Engineering Consultant is currently in progress.&#13;
3.12   All bidding packages for goods and associated services financed by the Bank would be subject&#13;
to the Bank's prior review of procurement documentation. All documents relating to procurement of&#13;
consulting services to be financed from proceeds of the loans of the Bank and JEXIM (assuming&#13;
RENEL's loan request is favorably considered, see para. 3.9) would be subject to the Bank's prior&#13;
review and approval, including the qualifications, experience, terms of reference and selection criteria&#13;
of the proposed consultant(s).&#13;

3.13   As a consequence of the above procurement approach, contracts with an estimated value of&#13;
about US$153.7 million (about 42% of the total project cost) would be financed under the Bank's ICB&#13;
procedures and this amount would increase to US$218.5 million if JEXIM funding is obtained. For&#13;
the turn-key contracts, the Bank will have packages/sub-packages with a total value of US$146.7&#13;
million. In addition, there will be one package for the power plant maintenance system overhaul for&#13;
US$3.0 million and one other package for environmental monitoring system for US$4.0 million.&#13;
Consultancies for engineering and project management services, and for technical assistance for the&#13;
sector reform, corporate restructuring of RENEL, studies and training will total about US$30.5&#13;
million, of which the Bank-financed portion would be about US$17 million. The engineering and&#13;
project management consultant selected in accordance with Bank Guidelines will be financed by the&#13;
Bank and the EBRD. In addition, two technical assistance services for the implementation of the&#13;
corporate restructuring program and for the audit of RENEL's financial statements in total value of&#13;
about US$5.4 million would be financed by the Bank, for which consultants will be selected on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
basis of shortlists of firms (para. 3.6). The non-bank-financed portion is expected to follow the&#13;
procurement procedures established by cofinanciers (EIB, EBRD, EU-PHARE and USAID).&#13;
Procurement under JEXIM financing is expected to follow Bank procedures (para 3.9). Procurement&#13;
packages and schedules for monitoring of procurement activities are provided in Annex 3.3.&#13;
Procurement will be closely monitored by the Bank as part of Bank supervision of the project&#13;
implementation. Within the framework of the project reporting (para 3.21), RENEL will be sending&#13;
to the Bank, periodically, the updated status of procurement, packages and costs.&#13;
F. Disbursements&#13;
3.14   The Bank funds would be disbursed against: (a) 85% of the cost of goods and associated&#13;
works and services with respect to turn-key contracts and (b) 100% of the cost for consulting&#13;
services. Expenditures amounting to a maximum of $5 million (5 % of the loan amount), incurred&#13;
within the 12-month period prior to loan signature and referring to consultant services, equipment and&#13;
materials contracted under Bank procurement guidelines, would be eligible for retroactive financing.&#13;
The schedule of disbursements for the proposed Bank Loan is summarized in Table 3.4. It indicates&#13;
a disbursement period of five years from the approval date of the loan. This schedule is based on the&#13;
Bank's "all sectors" standard disbursement profiles for loans to Romania which is judged to be the&#13;
best fit for this project for which disbursement will be for rehabilitation, instead of new power&#13;
plants. The physical completion of the project is expected by June 30, 1999, the guarantee period of&#13;
the last unit to be rehabilitated will run to the beginning of FY 2000. The closing date for the&#13;
proposed Loan should then be set as June 30, 2000, about six months after the estimated completion&#13;
of the guarantee period of the last unit to be commissioned under the Project. The detailed&#13;
disbursement profile is provided in Annex 3.3&#13;
Table 3.4: Estimated Disbursement Schedule&#13;

Cumulative   20.0   60.0   90.0  108.00   110.0&#13;
3.15   Disbursements for all contracts for goods and consulting service contracts above US$250,000&#13;
would be fully documented. All other contracts would be disbursed against Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs). The supporting documentation will be retained by RENEL and be made&#13;
available for review by Bank supervision mission and auditors. To facilitate the implementation of&#13;
the project, RENEL agreed at negotiations to open and maintain a Special Account with the National&#13;
Bank of Romania or anothler acceptable commercial bank in Romania on terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 6.3 (a)). The authorized allocation for the special account would be&#13;
US$5 million, representing the estimated average expenditures for a four-month period for items&#13;
financed by the Bank. The initial deposit will be limited to US$1 million and the remaining portion&#13;
of the authorized allocation will be released when disbursements reach a level of US$18 million.&#13;
Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted on a quarterly basis or&#13;
when one-third (1/3) of the amount deposited has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. All&#13;
applications for direct payments or special commitments must be for an amount not less than 20% of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
the special account deposit. In addition to documentation requirement stated above, each&#13;
replenishment application will be supported by monthly bank statements of the special account which&#13;
have been reconciled by RENEL. During negotiations, RENEL agreed to have the Special Account&#13;
and the project accounts audited and to submit to the Bank, six months after the end of each year,&#13;
the audit report for the past year. (para 6.3(a)).&#13;
G. Environmental Aspects&#13;
3.16   Environmental Category. In accordance with OD 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), the&#13;
proposed Project has been assigned to Category B, since the project will improve the environmental&#13;
performance of thermal power generation operations at a number of specific power stations. An&#13;
environrnental analysis (EA) has been completed by foreign consultants for the Government and&#13;
RENEL which analyzed the magnitude of potential impacts of the proposed Project (Annex 3.3; paras.&#13;
11-16).&#13;
3.17   Mitigating Measures. The measures included in the Project to mitigate any serious pollution&#13;
impacts from the future operations of RENEL after the rehabilitation are as follows:&#13;
(a)    introduction of low NOx burners and improvements in combustion systems will lead&#13;
to reductions of NOx emissions in addition to the elimination of the problem of severe&#13;
corrosion and damage to steam boilers;&#13;
(b)    improvements in fuel use efficiency through the rehabilitation of major unit&#13;
components - boilers, turbines and generators - will lead to decreases in fuel&#13;
consumption and associated pollutant emissions;&#13;
(c)    conversion to use of imported (low sulfur) hard coal at eleven lignite-fired units (for&#13;
economic reasons) will lead to reductions in all pollutant emissions from these units;&#13;
(d)    conversion to use of low sulphur fuel oil (&lt; 1% sulfur) instead of high sulphur fuel&#13;
oil (3-5% sulfur) also containing high levels of corrosive impurities (notably&#13;
vanadium) will lead to significant reductions in SO2 and will also improve operational&#13;
life and performance of boilers, and save on maintenance costs. As soon as&#13;
practicable, RENEL should substitute low sulphur for the high sulphur fuel oil in the&#13;
oil -fired steam boilers to be rehabilitated; and&#13;
(e)    rehabilitation and upgrade electrostatic precipitators will reduce dust and particulate&#13;
emissions.&#13;
In addition, a number of old and inefficient thermal units will be retired (Annex 3.3), which will&#13;
result in further overall emission reductions. All these measures will lead to reductions in emissions&#13;
of nitrogen oxides by about 46%, sulphur dioxide by about 47%, dust particulates by about 61 %, and&#13;
carbon dioxide by about 28% from the rehabilitated units (Annex 3.3). It is estimated that the costs&#13;
of equipment specifically designed to improve environmental conditions amount to about US$18&#13;
million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
3.18   Agreement has been reached with the Government and RENEL on a comprehensive program&#13;
of pollution monitoring by RENEL to complement the monitoring by the other government agencies&#13;
(Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Waters, Forestry and the Protection of the Environment).&#13;
Under the Project, RENEL will procure the necessary monitoring equipment and the requisite training&#13;
for implementation of the program (Annex 3.3). In addition, technical assistance will be provided&#13;
under the Project for institutional strengthening in environmental management and for occupational&#13;
health and safety improvements (Annex 3.3).&#13;
3.19   RENEL will adopt all the necessary measures to improve occupational health and&#13;
safety, which is currently a major issue within the power stations. At negotiations, RENEL agreed to&#13;
provide to the Bank a program for improvements in environmental management in RENEL, including&#13;
the establishment of a department devoted to environmental concerns, the definition of its main&#13;
functions and of its relations with the other departments. A training program for staff members of this&#13;
office was agreed upon at negotiations. By December 1, 1995, RENEL should appoint consultants,&#13;
under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, to assist in implementing the systems, including&#13;
training of RENEL staff, and assistance in implementing occupational health and safety programs at&#13;
headquarters and all thermal power generating facilities, including training of RENEL staff. These&#13;
commitments have been included in the Project Implementation Plan (Annex 3.3).&#13;
H. Project Implementation&#13;
3.20  Implementation responsibility for the Power Sector Reform Program will be with GoR,&#13;
through CCSER and Mol, while the Thermal Plant Rehabilitation Program and Corporate&#13;
Restructuring Program will be with RENEL. RENEL has set up a Project Implementation&#13;
Department (PID) to oversee the implementation of its components of the Project. The organizational&#13;
chart and the functions of the PID are provided in Annex 3.3, pages 24-25. Both Mol and RENEL&#13;
will need considerable amounts of technical and consulting assistance for implementing the various&#13;
components of the proposed Project. The technical assistance program is provided in Annex 3.3.&#13;
The qualifications and the timetable for appointment of the consulting engineer and the terms of&#13;
reference for the services, and those of the other consultants to be engaged under the technical&#13;
assistance program, have been decided during appraisal of the Project. At negotiations, RENEL&#13;
agreed to take all necessary measures to ensure that the Project Implementation Department will&#13;
continue to be adequately staffed andfunded in a manner satisfactory to the Bank (para 6.3 (g)). As&#13;
discussed earlier, there is a need for transfer of know-how, mainly from the consultants to be hired to&#13;
help in implementation, to the staff of Mol and RENEL so that they can take greater preparatory and&#13;
implementation responsibilities in the future. It would, therefore, be essential that Mol and RENEL&#13;
ensure active participation of the local counterpart teams in the activities of the consultants. In&#13;
addition, the Project components are sufficiently complex that they warrant special and focused&#13;
attention on a day-to-day basis. Finally, each of the project's components have different stakeholders&#13;
in the country and there is a need to build consensus at various steps to ensure successful&#13;
implementation. Therefore, the following actions have been taken to help ensure successful project&#13;
implementation:&#13;
(a)    GoR has established an Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee to oversee the&#13;
implementation of the Study of Options of Long-Term Structure for the Power Sector&#13;
Structure, for which the MoF's Directorate General for Energy will serve as the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
Secretariat and has also appointed the local counterpart team for the Study&#13;
(para 2.37(c)); and&#13;
(b)    RENEL has appointed a Corporate Restructuring Committee under the President-&#13;
Director General to oversee the design and implementation of RENEL Corporate&#13;
Restructuring Program.&#13;
In addition, at negotiations the GoR and RENEL agreed to carry out the proposed Project with due&#13;
diligence and efficiency and in confornity with appropriate practices, and shall provide promptly as&#13;
needed, the funds, facilities, services and other resources required for the purpose. In this regard,&#13;
GoR and RENEL agreed to secure all financing for the project by December 31, 1995 or such later&#13;
date as the Bank may agree (para 6.2 (a)).&#13;
Project Implementation arrangements are discussed in detail in Annex 3.3.&#13;
1. Project Monitoring and Bank Supervision&#13;
3.21   The proposed Project will need to be monitored closely to ensure successful implementation.&#13;
The requirement to engage qualified engineering consultants for the rehabilitation of the thermal&#13;
plants should help with physical implementation. However, there is a need for the top management&#13;
of Mol and of RENEL to also focus on the respective project components, because there are a&#13;
number of interim decisions that will be required to be taken to ensure progress of implementation in&#13;
accordance with the planned schedule. For example, Mol will need to decide, once the relevant&#13;
studies are completed, as to how the sector will be structured over the long term, and how the&#13;
restructuring would be accomplished. Also, RENEL will have to make decisions during the&#13;
procurement process and during the corporate restructuring process. In view of their limited&#13;
experience in the implementation of complex projects, and lack of experience dealing with&#13;
international financial institutions, close monitoring of their compliance with the agreed commitments&#13;
is necessary. In addition, the financing agencies, including the Bank, will require periodic reporting&#13;
by the beneficiary on the project's progress. A format for reporting to the Bank was discussed and&#13;
agreed with RENEL at appraisal. At negotiations, the reporting requirements were confirmed. An&#13;
outline of the Format is provided in Annex 3.3. To enable such monitoring, RENEL agreed at&#13;
negotiations to furnish to the Bank: (i) by October 31 each year beginning with 1995, for the Bank's&#13;
review, the draft of a rolling five-year corporate plan setting forth for each year (a) the agreed&#13;
medium-term investment program, the sources of financing of said investment program including&#13;
borrowing needs, and tariff levels and structures; (b) the financial targets, supported by financial&#13;
projections showing compliance with agreed financial performance criteria; (c) the progress in the&#13;
implementation of the Corporate Restructuring Program; and (ii) by December 31 of each year,&#13;
beginning with 1995, the final rolling five-year corporate plan, incorporating the Bank's comments on&#13;
the previous draft, and approved by GoR (para 6.3(e)).&#13;
3.22   Staff inputs required for supervision are estimated at about 30 staff weeks for the first year&#13;
and an average of 25 staff weeks for each of the subsequent years. Details of both the Borrower and&#13;
Bank staff inputs required were discussed at appraisal. All major contracts are on a turnkey basis,&#13;
(para. 3.10), and the project can be implemented successfully once these contracts are awarded.&#13;
Therefore, a measure of success of the project implementation will be that all major contracts for&#13;
rehabilitation of power plants are awarded by March 1997. Project implementation arrangements are&#13;
discussed in greater detail in Annex 3.3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. Background&#13;
4.1    RENEL's financial affairs are largely governed by Law 15/1990, which governs all RAs. As&#13;
regards RENEL, Law 15/1990 stipulates, among other things that:&#13;
*     RENEL should meet from its revenues all costs, including those required to be paid&#13;
under the Tax on Profit law;&#13;
*     in addition to 38% tax on taxable income, 90% of the net profit after taxes, should be&#13;
paid into the state budget;&#13;
*     the revenue and expenditures of RENEL are a part of the State's budget and will have&#13;
to be approved by the Government; and&#13;
*     new investments and disposal of old assets requires the Government's approval;.&#13;
In addition to Law 15/1990, Law 776 of November 1991 stipulates that electricity and thermal energy&#13;
prices will be approved by the Ministry of Finance; Law 66/1993 requires RENEL management to&#13;
enter into a management contract with the GoR on an annual basis; and special ordinances have been&#13;
enacted to address the issue of the systemic inter-enterprise arrears which affects RENEL (paras.&#13;
4.12-4.17). Accordingly, although RENEL Board of Administration has the power to set corporate&#13;
policy, critical decisions such as electricity and thermal energy pricing, investment levels, borrowing&#13;
levels, disposal of profits and senior staff appointments are actually taken by the Government itself.&#13;
The proposed project seeks to expand the capacity of RENEL to act autonomously within a legal&#13;
framework that promotes accountability.&#13;
B. Financial Management&#13;
Financial Organization&#13;
4.2    RENEL's financial management function is the responsibility of the Deputy Director General.&#13;
The 36 generation subsidiaries and the 42 transmission and distribution subsidiaries maintain separate&#13;
accounts, as required by law. In addition, there are four accounting units for the Research Institutes,&#13;
and 4 more for the nuclear construction group. The individual subsidiary's accounts are prepared at&#13;
the local level and consolidated at headquarters. Only the Income Statement and Balance sheet are&#13;
prepared for the utility.&#13;
4.3    The problems encountered in RENEL's accounting and financial management function are: (a)&#13;
RENEL's present financial accounting system is primarily cash-based and owing to bad record&#13;
keeping prevalent throughout the company, the financial information RENEL generates is unreliable;&#13;
(b) even though RENEL is required by Law 82 (the Accounting Law) to maintain its accounts in&#13;
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, RENEL has not developed a modern&#13;
electric utility accounting system appropriate for its size and functions; and (c) RENEL does not have&#13;
an appropriate cost-accounting system, which is necessary to: (i) assess the appropriateness of tariff&#13;
levels and structure; (ii) assess the cost-of-supply of electricity separately from thermal energy; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
(iii) distinguish between costs of generation, transmission and distribution; (d) basic accounting&#13;
practices, such as depreciation of assets, are manipulated to show minimal profits, in order to avoid&#13;
tax payments (para. 4.1) to the GoR; (e) the aggregate value of RENEL's plant, equipment and other&#13;
fixed assets is questionable, since no reliable records are maintained for the most part and the values&#13;
do not reflect the operational capability of these assets, many of which should be scrapped; and (f)&#13;
there is no long-term operational and financial planning, except the annual budget, whose periodic&#13;
review involves mainly physical targets.&#13;
4.4    To overcome the above critical deficiencies, as well as to address the structural problems in&#13;
RENEL (para 2.6) and overstaffing (para 2.8), the utility needs to implement a comprehensive&#13;
Corporate Restructuring Program, which will comprise the following phases: (a) restructuring&#13;
RENEL to spin-off non-core and non-conventional electricity utility activities and establishment of&#13;
cost/profit centers; (b) modernization of financial accounting system to a standard appropriate for the&#13;
size and function of RENEL; (c) development and implementation of a cost accounting system; (d)&#13;
physical verification of fixed and current assets, establishment of asset registers and preparation of&#13;
financial statements; (e) assessment of human resources availability and requirement, and&#13;
implementation of programs to reduce staff while filling the skills gaps; and (f) implementation of a&#13;
corporate budgeting and planning system. RENEL would require consultant assistance for designing&#13;
and implementing the requisite management systems, for which financing is included under the&#13;
proposed Project. Terms of reference for the Corporate Restructuring Program have been agreed&#13;
with RENEL. RENEL has agreed to completely implementt, before December 31, 1997, or such later&#13;
date as the Bank may agree, the Corporate Restructuring Program described above, with the&#13;
assistance of consultants whose terms of reference and qualifications are satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
(para 6.3(h)). It was also agreed that RENEL shall: (i) have its records, accounts andfinancial&#13;
statements, for each fiscal year beginning with 1995, audited, in accordance with appropriate&#13;
auditing principles consistenitly applied, by inidependent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (ii) furnish to&#13;
the Bank as soon as available, but in any case not later than six months after the end of each year:&#13;
(A) certified copies of its financial statements for such year as so audited; (B) the report of such audit&#13;
by said auditors, of such scope and in sulch detail as the Banik shall have requested; and (iii) furnish&#13;
to the Bank such other information concerning said records, accounts and financial statements as well&#13;
as the audit thereof as the Bank shall request (para 6.3 (a)).&#13;
Billing and Collections&#13;
4.5    RENEL has approximately 250,000 industrial and commercial customers who account for&#13;
roughly 80% of its electricity sales. These customers are billed monthly on the basis of meter&#13;
readings. Collection is made through the local banking system. RENEL also has about seven million&#13;
residential customers who are dealt with by about 100 offices around the country. Billing is done&#13;
once every two months. Collections are made in cash at each of the respective offices, and by meter&#13;
readers during meter reading.&#13;
4.6    Billing and collection by RENEL is hampered by: (a) very old metering equipment, in need&#13;
of urgent replacement; and (b) by law, the penalties for late payment cannot exceed the original bill&#13;
amount, which may not be enough incentive for payment when the delays are very long due to&#13;
inflation. Therefore, there is often no strong incentive to make payments on time, resulting in loss of&#13;
real revenues to RENEL. To address these issues, RENEL will implement a Billing and Collection&#13;
Modernization Program under the proposed project. This Billing and Collection Modernization&#13;
Program, which will include both equipment installation and technical assistance, will be : (i) based&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
on a recently completed study carried out by foreign consultants under Swiss Government funding and&#13;
Bank supervision; (ii) funded by EBRD; (iii) focused firstly on the Bucharest distribution system;&#13;
and (iv) later expanded to the entire RENEL system. At negotiations, RENEL agreed to implement&#13;
the Billing and Collection Modernization Program for its Bucharest distribution system by December&#13;
31, 1997, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank with the help of Consultants recruited by September&#13;
30, 1995. This is provided in the Project Implementation Plan (para.6.3 ()).&#13;
Insurance&#13;
4.7    The current practice in Romania (and in RENEL) is for the companies to bear the risks of any&#13;
damages to assets and personnel as and when they occur. However, the Government of Romania&#13;
intends to issue decisions and/or decrees to require the companies to establish insurance arrangements&#13;
as per standard industry practice internationally. Accordingly, RENEL plans to establish a self-&#13;
insurance scheme to cover the risks to its assets, as is the standard practice for many electricity&#13;
utilities around the world. Such self insurance scheme will be established soon after: (i) RENEL has&#13;
completed the physical verification and valuation of its assets (which is part of the Corporate&#13;
Restructuring Program under the Project); and (ii) the Government of Romania has issued the&#13;
measures referred to above. For these reasons, the current practice of RENEL is considered&#13;
acceptable until the two events mentioned above have occurred.&#13;
C. Past Performance&#13;
4.8    RENEL's operational performance during 1992 - 1994 is summarized in Table 4.1 and&#13;
provided in more detail in Annex 4.1. In view of the unreliability of the financial statements,&#13;
particularly asset accounting (including depreciation); and in view of the high inflation levels that&#13;
prevailed during the period, RENEL's past performance is analyzed in US$ cash flows terms.&#13;

2/ Net of VAT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
4.9    During 1991-94, RENEL's electricity sales declined by about 16% (from 51,531 GWh in&#13;
1991 to 47,178 GWh in 1992 and to 43,300 GWh in 1994) as the economy and, in particular, the&#13;
industrial sector (which accounts for nearly 80% of RENEL's electricity sales), continued to decline.&#13;
In addition, RENEL realized a lower than targeted average revenue (US$33.7/MWh in 1992,&#13;
US$34.9/MWh in 1993 and US$40.3/MWh in 1994, against targeted level of US$42.4 net of VAT),&#13;
due to some delays in adjustments in electricity tariffs in an environment of high inflation. Moreover,&#13;
as a consequence of the large proportion of thermal plant generation, higher than normal fuel&#13;
consumption, and other operational inefficiencies, including overstaffing, RENEL's cash operating&#13;
costs could not be reduced, even though sales declined. As a result, RENEL's operating margins were&#13;
slim as indicated by the working ratio, (i.e. the ratio of its cash operating costs to its operating&#13;
revenue), which averaged just over 90% during the three years. In addition, RENEL experienced&#13;
significant cash flow constraints, caused primarily by the systemic inter-enterprise arrears problem&#13;
prevailing in Romania. To compound the problems, RENEL continued with high investment levels of&#13;
US$523 million in 1992 and US$444 million in 1993, mainly for the construction of the Cernavoda&#13;
nuclear power station.&#13;
4.10   As a consequence of cash flow constraints, RENEL has had to resort to short-term borrowing&#13;
(less than one year) to meet local costs of investments. As a result, RENEL's debt service coverage&#13;
ratio (DSCR) declined from 14.9 in 1992 to 2.1 in 1994. RENEL's internal cash generation (ICG)&#13;
ratio (the ratio of its internal sources of funds to annual investments) was satisfactory at 31 % in 1992&#13;
and 37% in 1993 primarily because: (a) RENEL had a very low overall debt burden resulting in low&#13;
levels of debt service (US$12 million in 1992, and US$26 million in 1993); and (b) RENEL, kept its&#13;
working capital increases to a minimum by not maintaining sufficient operating inventories and by not&#13;
settling its accounts payable (particularly to fuel suppliers and transporters) on time. However, the&#13;
ICG was about 10% in 1994 owing to a three-fold increase in debt service, which in turn is a&#13;
consequence of RENEL having to start repaying the loans on the Cernavoda nuclear power plant.&#13;
RENEL Receivables and Payables&#13;
4.11   Given electricity's critical role in the economy and the fact that RENEL system is dominated&#13;
by thermal power generation capacity, it is not surprising that RENEL suffers from, and contributes&#13;
to, the systemic inter-enterprise arrears problem in Romania. RENEL's main consumers are heavy&#13;
industry (metallurgical, chemical) for electricity and local governments for thermal energy. The&#13;
heavy industrial sector is in a very weak financial situation owing to high levels of inefficiencies, lack&#13;
of market(s) for their products, and the downturn in the economy. Local governments face difficult&#13;
budgetary problems and are unable to meet their payments for energy supplies to municipal and social&#13;
services. Therefore, as RENEL customers delay paying their electricity and thermal energy bills,&#13;
RENEL responds by delaying payments to its suppliers, mainly for fuels, - coal/lignite, fuel oil and&#13;
natural gas. To address the inter-enterprise problem, in particular, and to improve financial viability&#13;
of critical RAs in general, the Government in September 1994 issued Decree 499/1994, placing five&#13;
RAs, including RENEL, under a special surveillance program.&#13;

RENEL's receivables amount to lei 936 billion (2.5 months of 1995 projected sales) of which Lei 669&#13;
billion (1.75 months of 1995 sales are in arrears (i.e. outstanding for more than 30 days). RENEL's&#13;
thermal energy receivables, which account for 33 % of overall receivables, are a larger problem&#13;
because the thermal energy is sold mainly to the district lieating companies of the municipalities, who&#13;
in turn supply to households. The district heating companies are unable to fully collect the bills on&#13;
time from their consumers and in turn fail to pay RENEL. RENEL's largest debtors are the&#13;
government owned industrial plants, all of them under Mol, which amount for 66% of RENEL&#13;
receivables. Among the industries, metallurgical are the biggest debtors accounting for 39% of&#13;
industry receivables (17% of overall), followed by petrochemical industries accounting for 30% (15%&#13;
of overall). The second largest set of debtors is the local governments, who account for 28% of&#13;
overall debts. The Bucharest municipality alone accounts for 90% of receivables from local&#13;
governments, or 25 % of overall debts.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
The above five fuel suppliers to RENEL account for 77% of the utility's accounts payable. It should&#13;
be noted that normally RENEL will become, cyclically, either a net creditor or a net debtor. At the&#13;
end of summer, RENEL will be a net debtor, since during summer, RENEL's electricity and thermal&#13;
energy sales are low (resulting in lower billing and lower collection); and towards the end of summer&#13;
(August/September), RENEL will start incurring higher fuel costs to build up stocks for the winter;&#13;
and at the end of winter (March/April), RENEL will be a net creditor, as electricity and thermal&#13;
energy sales will peak during winter and fuel expenses start declining.&#13;
Targets for RENEL Accounts Receivable and Payable&#13;
4.14   From a utility point of view, RENEL's accounts receivable level of about 2.5 months'&#13;
average sales is high but within acceptable boundaries. However, given the size of RENEL within&#13;
the Romanian economy (RENEL revenues of about US$2.3 billion in 1994 are equivalent to over&#13;
10% of GNP), a 3-month accounts receivable level would imply an amount equivalent to over 2% of&#13;
GNP. Therefore, RENEL's accounts receivable level has a considerable macroeconomic significance&#13;
and should be reduced to the minimum level possible. In this regard, there is a level below which the&#13;
utility's accounts receivable cannot be reduced, due to the logistics of billing and collections - RENEL&#13;
bills its major industrial customers every month, and allows them a month to pay. For its low&#13;
voltage consumers, particularly households, RENEL bills them once every two months and allows a&#13;
month for payment. Given the 80:20 ratio of high/medium voltage to low voltage consumers, the&#13;
minimum level of accounts receivable below which RENEL probably cannot go at present is about 60&#13;
days' sales. Therefore, in a first stage RENEL should aim at reducing and maintaining its accounts&#13;
receivable level at 2 months' sales. In terms of accounts payable, it is normal for a utility to maintain&#13;
its dues to suppliers at one month's supply. RENEL should target to maintain its accounts payable to&#13;
fuel suppliers at one month's average fuel bill or as per agreed terms in the supply contracts.&#13;
Actions to Resolve RENEL Arrears Situation&#13;
4.15   Most of RENEL's high/medium voltage industrial customers, who are the worst offenders,&#13;
are state-owned. Prior attempts at resolving the problem of unpaid bills by such customers have not&#13;
succeeded because of political interference, arising from social considerations (since cutting electricity&#13;
supply to industrial customers in arrears results in production stoppages, which reflects, in turn, on&#13;
employment); and lack of sufficient financial discipline. At present, RENEL is implementing a very&#13;
aggressive program to improve collections. However, additional arrangements must be implemented&#13;
to promote discipline, both by RENEL customers and by RENEL itself. Also, separate arrangements&#13;
must be devised for commercial businesses (commercial companies and other regie autonomies) who&#13;
must face market discipline and local governments, who cannot be shut down. This means that GoR&#13;
will have to play a critical role in the resolution of the inter-enterprise arrears problem, including the&#13;
institution of measures to prevent recurrent build-up of arrears.&#13;
4.16   To address the problem of RENEL arrears, a set of actions, collectively called the Financial&#13;
Recovery Plan (FRP) is being developed by RENEL and the GoR, under the proposed Financial and&#13;
Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan (para 1.2). RENEL's FRP would be the front-end portion -- i.e.&#13;
the first year -- of the Corporate Restructuring Program concentrating on the financial improvements&#13;
in 1995 only; and focuses on short-term measures that would achieve reduction in expenditures,&#13;
increase in cash revenues and reduction in arrears on both accounts receivable and payable. In its&#13;
dialogue on financial discipline issues, the Bank has emphasized the distinction between the stock of&#13;
arrears and new bills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
4.17   To ensure RENEL's financial solvency, GoR agreed to take all necessary actions to ensure&#13;
that GoR's departments, agencies and enterprises as well as local governments settle RENEL's&#13;
electricity and thermal energy bills within 60 days of the date of such bills. In addition, REAEL&#13;
agreed to ensure that (i) the receivables on its electricity and thermal energy sales to the private&#13;
sector, including households will not exceed two months' sales to such customers; and (ii) it will settle&#13;
its bills to its fuel suppliers as per contractual terms (para. 6.2 (c)). This is an ambitious objective,&#13;
given the financial problems faced by RENEL's largest customers. To achieve it, the Goverrnent&#13;
has provided assurances to the Bank that it will take all necessary measures to ensure that customers&#13;
in significant arrears that do not pay their current bills on time will be disconnected or will be subject&#13;
to progressively increasing electricity supply cuts. Also, the Treasury will change its administrative&#13;
regulations to enable it to pay RENEL directly from the budget allocations of agencies that are not&#13;
paying on time. Finally, it is expected that under the FESAL a financial relief fund will be&#13;
established to provide some limited assistance to selected firms that meet stringent criteria to help&#13;
them pay their current electricity bills. The issue of old arrears needs to be resolved through direct&#13;
negotiations between RENEL and its customers, leading to partial cancellation or extended repayment&#13;
periods based on a realistic assessment of their capacity to pay. It was agreed that RENEL shall have&#13;
provided to the Bank satisfactory evidence that it has concluded enforceable arrangements for debt&#13;
repayment with each of its customers listed in an Annex to the Power Sector Strategy (para 6.4) as a&#13;
condition of loan effectiveness.&#13;
D. RENEL Investment Program and Financing&#13;
4.18   At negotiations, the GoR and RENEL confirmed the medium-term (1995-2000) power sector&#13;
investment program. It is estimated to amount to about US$2,323 million in nominal terms,&#13;
comprising US$1,607 million in foreign exchange costs (72%). In accordance with the Government's&#13;
strategy for the Power Sector (para 2.33), RENEL's investment priority will be: (i) rehabilitation of&#13;
existing supply facilities in generation, transmission and distribution; (ii) the completion of high&#13;
priority unfinished hydro and thermal plants at advanced stages of completion; (iii) expansion and&#13;
reinforcement of the power transmission and distribution network and modernization of the load&#13;
dispatching system for energy management applications; and (iv) heat transmission system,&#13;
environmental pollution control and land reclamation. It is crucial for RENEL to focus on thermal&#13;
plant rehabilitation investments in the next 3-4 years, and on other rehabilitation investments during&#13;
the subsequent years. GoR and RENEL agreed to review with the Bank, by October 31 of each year,&#13;
the medium-term investment program, including the sources of financing, and to take the views of the&#13;
Bank into account in modifying the investment program (paras 6.3 (e)). RENEL Investment Program&#13;
for the period 1995-2000 is provided in Table 4.4.&#13;

E. Financial Forecasts&#13;
4.19   RENEL's investments should only comprise the proposed investments discussed above. To&#13;
finance the local costs of these levels of investments, RENEL may not be able to borrow domestically&#13;
since the domestic financial markets are shallow relative to RENEL's needs. Therefore, RENEL&#13;
aims to finance all of its local costs of investments from its internal cash generation (ICG). Also, in&#13;
view of the separation of nuclear activities, the nuclear power investments, and the associated debt&#13;
service obligations will be the responsibility of the GoR and the new nuclear power entity (para 2.38&#13;
(a)).&#13;
4.20   Under the above-mentioned planning environment, the forecasts of operational and financial&#13;
performance of RENEL during 1995 - 2000 are summarized in Table 4.5, and provided in detail in&#13;
Annex 4.1. RENEL's sales of electricity are expected to grow by about 2.4% each year until 1998;&#13;
and then increase at about 2.2% per year, to reach a level of 50,000 GWh in the year 2000. These&#13;
rates are lower than the expected economic growth of about 5%, as energy intensity is expected to&#13;
fall. Thermal energy sales are assumed (conservatively) to remain constant at 45,105 Gcal/year&#13;
throughout the forecast period. As a consequence, growth in operating revenue, from US$2.37&#13;
billion in 1995 to US$2.7 billion in the year 2000, will come primarily from growth in electricity&#13;
sales, since average electricity tariffs are expected to be maintained at about US$50/MWh, inclusive&#13;
of VAT. However, the cash operating costs (i.e., other than depreciation), are expected to increase at&#13;
a slower rate than revenues, as an outcome of implementing the FRP and of reductions in fuel cost&#13;
due to efficiency improvements under the Project. Therefore, RENEL's working ratio is expected to&#13;
improve somewhat to 88.8% in the year 2000.&#13;
4.21  In 1995, the utility's ICG will be about 23%, as a result of slightly higher sales, and removal&#13;
of Cernavoda nuclear power development expenditures from RENEL's investment program.&#13;
RENEL's ICG in 1995 would have been higher if the tariff increases, which were due at the&#13;
beginning of 1995, had been effected on time (tariffs were adjusted to US$50/Mwh in June 1995).&#13;
RENEL's ICG will range between 30% and 45% in the remaining part of the forecast period, for an&#13;
average of about 38%, which is sufficient to cover the local cost of its investments. As RENEL&#13;
incurs significant levels of debt to finance its investment program, its debt service coverage ratio&#13;
(DSCR) will decline. However, RENEL will still be able to achieve DSCR levels of above 1.5,&#13;
which is satisfactory.&#13;

4.22   Given that RENEL will have to operate under a "de-facto" price cap regimne during the forecast&#13;
period, the utility will have to take steps to improve and maintain its financial viability (e.g. meet all of&#13;
its operating costs and finance a reasonable portion of its investments) and creditworthiness (e.g. be able&#13;
to comfortably service its debt after meeting all operating costs). RENEL agreed to: (a) produce, for&#13;
each of its fiscal years after its fiscal year 1994, funds from internal sources equivalent to no less than&#13;
30% of the average of RENEL capital expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred, for that year,&#13;
the previous fiscal year and the next following year; (para 6.3 (b); and (ii) take such measures as may be&#13;
necessary to ensure that the estimated net revenues shall be at least 1.5 times, in 1995 and each&#13;
succeeding fiscal year, the estimated maximum debt service requirements of RENEL for any such fiscal&#13;
year on all debt of RENEL (para 6.3 (c)).&#13;
Financial Impact of Nuclear Power Generation on RENEL&#13;
4.23   The separation of nuclear power activities into an independent public entity (para 2.37 (a)), and&#13;
the establishment of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between this new entity and RENEL will have&#13;
an impact on RENEL finances and, therefore, on its tariffs, if RENEL is to achieve the financial&#13;
performance criteria stated earlier. Since the price of purchased power from the new nuclear entity has&#13;
yet to be set, several levels of nuclear power prices to RENEL were examined for their impact on&#13;
RENEL's retail electricity tariffs.&#13;
4.24   Such analyses show that if the nuclear power purchase price is US cents 3/kWh (which is just&#13;
below RENEL's average cost of US cents 3.09/kWh of hydro and thermal electricity generated), RENEL&#13;
can achieve its planned financial performance targets with an average price of about US$42.4/MWh&#13;
equivalent. However, if the nuclear power purchase cost is higher, for example in the US cents 4-6/kWh&#13;
range, then RENEL tariffs need to be increased beyond planned levels, since the power purchase cost will&#13;
exceed RENEL's own generation costs by higher and higher amounts. Since the PPA between RENEL&#13;
and the nuclear entity needs to be satisfactory to the Bank, the Bank's review of the proposed power&#13;
purchase agreement (PPA) between RENEL and the new nuclear power entity, will focus, among other&#13;
things, on ensuring appropriate level of the power transfer price (an artificially low price would require a&#13;
government budget subsidy to the nuclear power entity, and a transfer price above RENEL's cost of&#13;
generation will require increases in RENEL tariffs to its customers).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
5.1    The CAS submitted to the Board with the Petroleum Sector Rehabilitation Project on March 14,&#13;
1994, mentions the support of reforms in the power sector as one of the priorities in the Bank lending&#13;
program for 1994 - 1997. The Bank's involvement would be critical to steer the development and&#13;
implementation of market oriented sectoral policies and institutional reforms. The proposed Project is in&#13;
line with the agreed strategy of promoting efficiency of energy use as a way of conserving scare&#13;
resources, while reducing environmental pollution. The Bank's experience in power sector reforms&#13;
worldwide will contribute to the development of a sound legal and regulatory framework. The Bank will&#13;
be instrumental in mobilizing cofinancing. Furthermore, the Bank's involvement will contribute to&#13;
meeting the structural reform objectives under the SAL, specifically in reducing the budget deficit through&#13;
rationalization of the power sector investment program; and maintaining the momentum of liberalization&#13;
of energy prices. Future Bank lending to the sector is envisioned, contingent upon satisfactory progress&#13;
in the implementation of policy reforms.&#13;
5.2    The physical component of the Project is the least-cost solution to meet the demand for electricity&#13;
in comparison with all the alternative feasible options considered, including imports of electricity.&#13;
Sensitivity analysis carried out to establish the robustness of the economic solution on the basis of the&#13;
technical and economic risks that could arise with the implementation of the Project, confirmed the&#13;
robustness of the economic solution. The following sections explain, in summary, the justification.&#13;
Further details are provided in Annex 5.1.&#13;
B. Generation Capacity&#13;
5.3    The future electricity demand profile indicates that for the foreseeable future the system's priority&#13;
requirement will continue to be base load, as opposed to peaking capacity requirements. However, the&#13;
dependable output of the thermal plants, which provide base load, is rapidly declining. The Bank&#13;
estimates that dependable thermal capacity would decline from the current level of about 5,500 MW to&#13;
about 3,500 MW by year 2000, if no rehabilitation takes place, and if current poor operations and&#13;
management practices continue. The thermal capacity that will be reinstated through the rehabilitation&#13;
program will restore firm base load capability to meet demand through year 2000.&#13;
C. Least-Cost Analysis&#13;
5.4    The results of a preliminary study of Least-cost Power Generation Development, carried out by&#13;
consultants for RENEL in 1992, assigned priority to the rehabilitation of existing generating facilities.&#13;
The follow-up technical inspection and feasibility study of rehabilitation (para. 3.3 - 3.6) to complement&#13;
that finding showed that the plants are in much more degraded and unsafe operating condition than&#13;
assumed in the least-cost study, and urgent rehabilitation is needed to prevent further rapid decline in&#13;
output and availability of base load capacity, and to improve operational safety.&#13;
5.5    To establish that the proposed rehabilitation program is the least- cost solution, it was compared&#13;
to other options of providing base load capacity. The comparison shows that the rehabilitation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
thermal units is economically more favorable than alternatives which include: (a) completion of Units 2&#13;
and 3 of the Cernavoda nuclear power plant and of unfinished hydropower plants, with storage reservoirs,&#13;
on firm energy capability basis; and (b) gas fired combined-cycle alternative. The time constraint in&#13;
making capacity available is an added advantage of rehabilitation over new units. The possibility of&#13;
imports of electricity from Ukraine was examined, but was disregarded because it would be more&#13;
expensive than the production from the rehabilitated units, and in addition, it could not be relied upon as&#13;
a source of firm continuous supply to meet base-load requirements. However, during critical periods of&#13;
demand, when some of the large units would be under rehabilitation, imports may be needed to&#13;
supplement local supply. Table 5.1 provides the comparison.&#13;

a/ Highest cost rehabilitation candidate.&#13;
b/ On the basis of estimated firm energy production capability.&#13;
5.6    There are uncertainties concerning the additional cost of completion of the Cernavoda nuclear&#13;
power units, which should be established by a detailed engineering assessment. In addition, the costs do&#13;
not include de-commissioning and spent fuel disposal costs, which are considered to be high. Finally, no&#13;
account has been taken of the longer time required to complete Cernavoda Unit 2 compared with the time&#13;
needed to rehabilitate Isalnita, but this consideration also favors rehabilitation. Considering the urgent&#13;
need for firm based-load capacity in the system the lowest cost of rehabilitation, and the above&#13;
considerations, rehabilitation of Isalnita is the preferred option.&#13;
5.7    Even with the reinstatement of capacity that the rehabilitation provides, the power system may be&#13;
barely able to meet the expected demand. Table 5.2 compares available dependable continuous power&#13;
output with demand on the system by year 2000.&#13;

D. Lignite to Imported Hard Coal Conversion&#13;
5.8    The technical inspection and feasibility study conducted on the lasi cogeneration lignite fired unit&#13;
was to establish the technical and economic merits of conversion of 11 similar units (1 lx50 MW&#13;
cogeneration) to use of imported hard coal as the primary fuel. The results confirmed the technical and&#13;
economic justification for such conversion. An additional important benefit is the reduction in air&#13;
pollution and lower volume of ash disposal that the conversion would bring about.&#13;
5.9    The economic merit is the curtailment of the uneconomic transportation of lignite over long&#13;
distances (300-600 km). At the lasi power station the economic cost of lignite delivered is about&#13;
US$25/ton compared to the delivered cost of imported hard coal through Constanza port of about&#13;
US$50/ton. To establish the economic merit of the conversion, the present value of economic cost of&#13;
lignite at the power station over the life of the unit was compared with the present value of the&#13;
incremental capital and fuel costs for the conversion over the same life of the unit on heat equivalent&#13;
basis. The former was estimated at US$140 million compared with US$60 million for the latter. In&#13;
addition, operation and maintenance costs will be lower in the case of the conversion.&#13;
5.10   Similar analysis has been extended to the other 10 units at the different locations in the North&#13;
Eastern part of the country. The conversion of the units, apart from the environmental benefits, provides&#13;
a least-cost means of serving the same quantity of thermal energy and electricity demand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
E. Rate of Return Analysis&#13;
5.11   The rate of return on the investments in the rehabilitation component is estimated to be about 21%&#13;
compared to the estimated long-term opportunity cost of capital to Romania of about 10%. The analysis&#13;
follows the traditional approach of comparing quantifiable incremental costs and benefits to the power&#13;
system of the rehabilitation program. The estimates of investment costs and of fixed operation and&#13;
maintenance costs are based on the estimates of the consultants that conducted the feasibility study. Fuel&#13;
costs are estimated at improved unit efficiencies resulting from rehabilitation, and fuel was valued at&#13;
border prices. Allowance was made for the incremental cost to the power system as result of a unit being&#13;
on outage for rehabilitation by increasing the output of less efficient power units to replace the output of&#13;
the units under rehabilitation. The incremental cost (outage cost) was based on the additional fuel and&#13;
other variable operating costs to the power system. All costs were expressed in economic terms and in&#13;
prices of January 1994.&#13;
5.12   The quantifiable benefits comprise: (a) fuel savings from improved unit efficiency;&#13;
(b) increase in electricity production resulting from increase in power output, and improved availability of&#13;
the rehabilitated units; (c) savings in consumption of support fuel, natural gas and fuel oil, in the lignite&#13;
and coal fired units through improved loading of units, and reduction in stops and starts of the units;&#13;
(d) improvement in quantity and reliability of heat supply, which is captured through credit of the&#13;
efficiency of cogeneration to electricity production.&#13;
5.13   Incremental electricity sales were valued at an average electricity price of US cents 5/kWh, the&#13;
agreed annual average price which the Government has committed to maintain in real terms over the year.&#13;
Since price is a poor proxy for benefits, as it fails to capture the consumer surplus, this method of&#13;
calculation underestimates the economic rate of return on the project. Details are presented in Annex 5.1.&#13;
5.14   For the conversion, incremental costs consist of the capital cost of the conversion and the&#13;
associated fixed operation and maintenance costs. The benefit is the savings in cost of fuel delivered, and&#13;
operation and maintenance costs.&#13;
F. Other Benefits&#13;
5.15   Other benefits, which are not readily quantifiable, are associated with the improvements in the&#13;
quality of the environment, mainly the reduction in air pollution that the rehabilitation will bring about.&#13;
Additional benefits will arise from improvements in management and associated operational cost&#13;
reductions arising from the corporate restructuring program.&#13;
G. Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
5.16   The Base Case analysis already takes account of possible delays in project implementation by&#13;
considering implementation over five years instead of three years in which the proposed rehabilitation&#13;
program would normally be implemented and completed. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to test the&#13;
robustness of the economics of the project as follows: (i) a 20% increase in capital costs could arise in&#13;
rehabilitation work of this nature due to greater than expected plant deterioration that might be uncovered&#13;
during implementation; and (ii) considerations that the rehabilitation might not achieve the expected&#13;
improvements in fuel use efficiency and availability, thus leading to higher fuel consumption and that the&#13;
targeted level of output and reliability may not be achieved. Reduction of 10% in fuel use efficiency and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
in expected availability improvements are assumed. Additional sensitivity tests were conducted to assess&#13;
the impacts of extreme conditions on project economics. For the economic rate of return to fall to about&#13;
10% (switching value analysis) a combination of the following changes would have to occur&#13;
simultaneously, which is unlikely: (i) a two-year delay in project completion; (ii) a 20% increase in&#13;
capital costs; (iii) a 10% reduction in the expected improvements in fuel use efficiencies (already&#13;
conservatively assumed); and (iv) a reduction of about 10% in the expected power output and availability&#13;
of the rehabilitated units.&#13;
5.17   The results of the analysis shown in Table 5.3 indicate the robustness of the rate of return in the&#13;
face of increased capital costs and reductions in fuel use efficiency, and electricity production. The rate&#13;
of return is most sensitive to the reduction in expected output and unit availability.&#13;

(a) 20% increase in capital cost                           18&#13;
(b) 10% reduction in fuel efficiency                       17&#13;
(c) 10% reduction in availability                          15&#13;
(d) Reduced Project Scope                                  18&#13;
(e) Combination of (a) (b) and (c)                         10&#13;
5.18   A further sensitivity analysis was carried out on the base case to show the effect of a reduced&#13;
project scope arising from unavailability of the cofinancing now being sought from JEXIM. In this&#13;
case, the rehabilitation program will exclude the second thermal unit at Deva (210 MW) and the&#13;
conversion of 200 MW of lignite based capacity to imported coal use proposed for JEXIM financing&#13;
(para 3.8). This would penalize the power system through a net incremental benefit foregone due to&#13;
the reduced rehabilitation scope, and the non-conversion of the isolated power stations from lignite to&#13;
imported coal use. The economic rate of return in this case is estimated to be about 18%.&#13;
H. Sustainability&#13;
5.19   Training in management and in modern corporate and financial systems will be provided; this,&#13;
in addition to the initiation of the long-term reform measures is expected to help the benefits of the&#13;
corporate restructuring of RENEL. Achievement and sustainability of the benefits from the physical&#13;
components of the Project will be highly dependent on three main factors. These are: (a) the quality&#13;
of materials used and quality of construction (b) the effectiveness of the project implementation; and&#13;
(c) improvements in post rehabilitation operation and maintenance. The poor practices in these areas&#13;
in the past have been the principal causes of the rapid and premature deterioration, and the poor&#13;
performance of thermal power plants, which have necessitated the proposed rehabilitation project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
5.20 The lessons learnt by the Bank and the Romanians from the past have been taken into&#13;
account. The establishment of a well structured project implementation department with experienced&#13;
foreign technical advisors and consultants will ensure quality of both materials used and construction,&#13;
and would ensure efficient project management and execution through new methods and technologies&#13;
that would be introduced. Factory acceptance tests and other measures have been incorporated in the&#13;
project implementation to assure quality of materials. Through the contractual arrangements,&#13;
construction and erection will be undertaken by experienced contractors with proven track record.&#13;
The computerized plant maintenance program, complemented by three years supply of essential spare&#13;
parts with the associated training of RENEL staff is aimed at enhancing plant maintenance, which&#13;
would be sustained by the improvements in the financial position of RENEL. The program for&#13;
improved environmental management will contribute to sustaining the environmental benefits of the&#13;
project. All these measures are to be complemented by active Bank supervision of the project&#13;
implementation. With these measures, the benefits of the Project would be achieved and sustained.&#13;
In the long run, sustaining the institutional and policy achievements will be contingent upon the&#13;
govermment's continued commitment to a market economy.&#13;
1. Risks&#13;
5.21   The main risk associated with the proposed Project relates to the implementation of the sector&#13;
reform and restructuring program. To address this, some important upfront actions have been taken.&#13;
The actions include: (a) the appointment by the GoR of a high level Inter-Ministerial Committee to&#13;
oversee the Study of Options of Long-term Power Sector Structure and the initiation of the Study; (b)&#13;
the issuance of the Statement of Power Sector Policy by the Govermnent stating the government's&#13;
medium to long-term reform policy objectives for the power sector, and the Strategy Document that&#13;
outlines how the policy framework will be implemented. A review would be conducted each year to&#13;
assess progress in achieving the development objectives of the project and to consider need for further&#13;
policy actions or project restructuring (para 2.37 (d)).&#13;
5.22   A second concern is possible financial risk due to the inability of RENEL to mobilize the&#13;
counterpart funds adequately and timely. This risk is mitigated by rate increases already&#13;
implemented, and the measures to be implemented under the Project to improve billing and collection,&#13;
and reduction of arrears. Close monitoring of performance is planned. A third concern relates to the&#13;
availability of cofinancing. However, progress in this regard has been satisfactory and both EBRD&#13;
and EIB are at an advanced stage of project preparation. Even if confinancing is not fully secured,&#13;
such as if JEXIM confinancing does not materialize, the restructured project would still be&#13;
economically and technically viable, as shown by the sensitivity analysis (para. 5.18).&#13;
5.23   Another concern is project implementation risk pertaining to the capacity of RENEL to&#13;
implement a complex and demanding project. This is being addressed through a well staffed Project&#13;
Implementation Department that has already been set-up (para 6.3(h)), and by using the turnkey&#13;
contract modality to procure the rehabilitation of each of the power plants, which will reduce the need&#13;
for detailed involvement of RENEL in the works. In addition, the process of selecting a reputable&#13;
engineering consultant (the Engineer) by RENEL for the engineering and project management services&#13;
is nearly completed. Hence, the risk has been mitigated as much as possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

POWER SECTOR REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
THE CERNAVODA NUCLEAR POWER PROJECT&#13;
1.    The Cernavoda nuclear power project was started in the mid-1970's by the Government of&#13;
Romania, with Canadian and Italian financial assistance of about US$400 million in suppliers credits&#13;
for the initial phase of construction of a 5x700 MW power station. The technology is based on&#13;
CANDU-6 nuclear reactor of Canadian design, using natural uranium as fuel and heavy water as&#13;
coolant and moderator, and a General Electric Turbogenerator. Engineering services and project&#13;
management were to be provided by a Consortium (AAC) of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited&#13;
(AECL), and Ansaldo-Impianti of Italy. Equipment and materials were to be mainly of foreign&#13;
origin.&#13;
2.    Construction commenced on all 5 units in 1980, but attention was focused on Unit I after&#13;
1985, by which time the civil works construction on all the units had reached various stages of&#13;
completion. Following the decision of the Govermnent to prepay its foreign debts, it was decided to&#13;
complete the project using primarily local inputs. As such, all foreign contracts on the project were&#13;
terminated. From hence, construction proceeded slowly due to shortages in funding and lack of&#13;
experience.&#13;
3.    In 1990, the new Government, in the face of difficulties in continuing with project&#13;
construction, sought Canadian and Italian Governments' financial assistance in a loan of US$415&#13;
million - US$315 million from Canada, and about US$100 million from Italy - mainly to finance&#13;
engineering management services by AECL and Ansaldo-Implianti and for 18 months operational and&#13;
management services by the consortium after commissioning of the unit. At that time, construction of&#13;
Unit I was about 55-60% complete, Unit 2 about 31%, and the rest were at much lower levels of&#13;
completion. At that time, about US$1.2 billion was needed to complete Unit 1. Following initial&#13;
review to ensure that previous construction works met required engineering and safety standards,&#13;
work has proceeded relatively smoothly on Unit 1 with temporary suspension of work on the other&#13;
units. Orders for equipment that had been placed with local firms for Unit 2 proceeded. According&#13;
to RENEL, nearly 70% of the equipment for Unit 2 ordered before 1991 have been completed and&#13;
delivered to site. By September 1994, construction of Unit 1 had reached about 95% completion and&#13;
was expected to be commissioned by April 1995. At present, all works are expected to be completed&#13;
with the first delivery of power to the national power transmission grid in November 1995, and&#13;
commissioning is scheduled for March 1996, when commercial operation could start. RENEL is now&#13;
seeking joint ventures with foreign investors for build-operate-and-transfer (BOT) arrangements or&#13;
other types of non-recourse financing, in which payment would be made to the foreign partners in&#13;
electricity supplies, to complete Unit 2.&#13;
4.    The construction of Unit 1 has been accorded a national priority status, and initially, it was&#13;
the intention of the Government to finance the entire development, including the debt service&#13;
obligations, from the state budget. However, since 1992, the Government has not been able to meet&#13;
the obligations in view of the budgetary constraints. As such, RENEL and other state agencies have&#13;
been called upon by the Government to fill in the local financing gap. Factories commissioned to&#13;
provide equipment and materials for the project are granted preferential access to credits and foreign&#13;
exchange.&#13;
&#13;

5.    The Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has conducted separate inspections of the construction of&#13;
Unit land has found the works satisfactory. Most of the recommendations of the IAEA have been&#13;
fully complied with. The rest are gradually being implemented. A post-commissioning inspection is&#13;
expected in 1996.&#13;

STATEMENT OF POLICIES FOR THE POWER SECTOR&#13;
February 23, 1995&#13;
Mr. Michael Wiehen&#13;
Director&#13;
Europe and Central Asia Department I&#13;
The World Bank&#13;
1818 H St., N.W.&#13;
Washington, D.C. 20433&#13;
Re: Statement of Policies for the Romanian Power Sector&#13;
Dear Mr. Wiehen,&#13;
The Government of Romania (GoR), through its Ministry of Industries (Mol) and the&#13;
Romania Electricity Authority (RENEL) with the assistance of Bank staff, has completed preparation&#13;
of the propose Power Sector Rehabilitation and Modernization Project (the proposed Project), for&#13;
which we have request Bank assistance in its financing and implementation. This project is&#13;
designed to support a comprehensive reform of the power sector to bring about efficiency&#13;
improvements, and to provide for reliable electricity supply at least-cost, while addressing&#13;
environmental concerns.&#13;
In support of the above request, I hereby outline the GoR's policies and objectives for the&#13;
electricity sector and the program of actions (Attachment A) the GoR is committed to take to achieve&#13;
its objectives.&#13;
Power Sector Policy and Strategy&#13;
The main objectives of the GoR's policy are to meet electricity demand in the most economic&#13;
manner, to improve the efficiency of the sector, and to improve reliability of supply. The strategy to&#13;
achieve these policy objectives calls for the:&#13;
*     implementation of radical, comprehensive and stepped reforms to the sector&#13;
organization and its legal framework which will create conditions for effective&#13;
competition;&#13;
*     adaptation of the sector institutions to a market-oriented economy through corporate&#13;
restructuring to ensure autonomy and accountability;&#13;
*     adoption of least-cost development program which considers all feasible alternatives,&#13;
including resources available to the country, including rehabilitation and&#13;
modernization of existing g facilities and demand side management;&#13;
*     implementation of pricing policies that would ensure sector economic viability and&#13;
provide private sector participation;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64                                     Annex 2.8&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
*     establishing conditions for Romania's greater participation in a larger regional power&#13;
market in Europe; and&#13;
*     taking of actions to minimize environmental impact and promote conservation.&#13;
Sector Reforms&#13;
The GoR is committed to fundamental, comprehensive and stepped reforms in the power&#13;
sector. In 1990, in order to separate policy and strategy functions from entity operations and&#13;
management, the GoR created RENEL, as an autonomous public electric power utility. Additionally,&#13;
a number of actions to restructure RENEL are to be continued as an integral part of the proposed&#13;
Project. A further step to bring about the desired improvement in efficiency is to create conditions&#13;
for the participation of independent operators, both public and private, in a competitive environment.&#13;
This will require the implementation of fundamental reforms to the sector structure and regulatory&#13;
framework.&#13;
TO develop a sound basis for carrying out the reforms, the GoR has decided to engage the&#13;
services of International Consultants to undertake a "Study of Options for the Long-Term Structure of&#13;
the Power Sector" (the Study). The Study will evaluate, starting from the existing strategy for the&#13;
energy sector, alternative forms of sector structure presenting advantages and opportunity of the&#13;
proposed alternatives, and their associated legal and regulatory aspects. The GoR has established a&#13;
High Level Interministerial Committee to oversee the Study on its behalf. The GoR will review&#13;
progress periodically, as well as discuss the results of the Study with the Bank following its&#13;
completion. The GoR will analyze the final report, and will decide on the solution for restructuring&#13;
the sector. The solution will be implemented in agreement with a stepped action plan,, which will be&#13;
established in consultation with the Bank. The GoR has agreed the terms of reference for the Study&#13;
with the Bank, and secure funding from the United States Agency for International Development&#13;
(USAID).&#13;
Electricity Law&#13;
To provide the legal basis of the reform, and to create the enabling conditions for the&#13;
participation of publicly-owned and private independent operators in a competitive environment, the&#13;
GoR is preparing an Electricity Law (the Law). In the process of preparing the Law, the GoR is&#13;
ensuring that its policy objectives are duly reflected in the draft, and the rules of the Study can be&#13;
properly implemented.&#13;
To this end, the Law will:&#13;
*     define the roles of the Government as policy maker, as the owner of the public&#13;

Since the preparation of the law will be furnished after the final decision regarding the&#13;
structure adopted by the Government in legal terminology and will permit a wide rage of schemes for&#13;
the participation of the private sector. Following approval of the Law by our Parliament, the GoR&#13;
intends to seek Bank assistance to help develop detailed regulations for the power sector and to&#13;
establish the Regulatory Body.&#13;
Corporate Restructuring of RENEL&#13;
Based on its own strategy for the energy sector, the GoR endorsed the program of corporate&#13;
restructuring proposed by RENEL into a modern, commercially viable public utility. As a first step,&#13;
to focus RENEL's activities on the primary activities of electricity and heat production and supply,&#13;
part of the non-core activities of its engineering and technical institutes and of construction, repairs&#13;
and manufacturing subsidiaries will be separated into independent commercial companies. In&#13;
addition, all nuclear power activities will also be separated into an independent public entity. This&#13;
Government Decision and the logistical and legal actions to effect separation will be formally issued&#13;
by the Government in accordance with the timetable agreed with the Bank. In the medium term, the&#13;
program will include the improvement of RENEL's management, mainly the accounting and financial&#13;
systems, and will be implemented with the assistance of foreign consultants. In the transition period&#13;
to corporation, management contracts have been introduced as a means of improving performance,&#13;
profit and responsibility within the RENEL.&#13;
Pricing&#13;
In order to promote the efficiency of the sector, as well as to provide incentives for private&#13;
sector participation, the policy of GoR is to set electricity prices to all consumers to reflect the&#13;
economic costs of supply. However, for social reasons the Government wishes to protect low income&#13;
households from large price increases, and pricing policies would be designed with this consideration&#13;
in mind. To establish the basis for future pricing setting, the GoR has decided to undertake an&#13;
Electricity and Heat Pricing Study with the assistance of consultants. In the interim period, prices&#13;
will be set in accordance with the agreement with the Bank under the Structural Adjustment Loan&#13;
(SAL) to maintain their levels in real terms at an average of US$50/MWh, including VAT.&#13;
Inter-enterprise arrears&#13;
The Gor has taken measures that will lead to the graDual reduction of inter-enterprise arrears&#13;
and to the prevention of any re-emergence of them. RENEL has prepared a Financial Recovery Plan&#13;
that includes the necessary measures to achieve this objective. The GoR will strictly enforce&#13;
compliance with those measures. Under the FRP, RENEL will reduce operating costs and minimize&#13;
arrears from its customers.&#13;
Sector Investments and Development Plans&#13;
The GoR has established that rehabilitation of the existing power supply facilities provides the&#13;
most cost effective means of restoring capacity and improving and simultaneously reducing the power&#13;
plants' impact on the environment. The GoR, therefore, gives a high priority to the economic&#13;
rehabilitation, and has prepared a medium-term (1994-2000) rehabilitation and modernization&#13;
program with a total cost of US$2.1 billion. The first phase of this program, which will also&#13;
include retirement of old and inefficient units, is to be implemented under the proposed Project with&#13;
financial assistance from the Bank and the other multilateral agencies. Meanwhile, the GoR will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

66                                     Annex 2.8&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
undertake a Least-Cost Power System Development Study, with the assistance of consultants, to&#13;
establish the basis for the long-term development of the sector t meet future demand in the most&#13;
economic manner. The study will examine the economic merits of all feasible alternatives, including&#13;
further rehabilitation of existing plants, completion of the suspended thermal and hydropower&#13;
projects, and also units 2-5 of the Cernavoda Nuclear Power Plant, and new feasible alternative plant&#13;
candidates&#13;
The GoR will discuss the results of the study with the Bank, and will adopt the optimal&#13;
investment program as a basis of the future development of the sector.&#13;
Under the proposed Project the GoR together with the Bank will carry out annual review on&#13;
ongoing an planned investments in the sector, including the sources of financing.&#13;
Energy Conservation&#13;
Because of our past industrialization strategy, which was based on the development of energy-&#13;
intensive industries, and the lack of incentives to use energy efficiently, our intensity of energy&#13;
intensity is one of the highest in Europe. The GoR recognizes the high economic and environmental&#13;
dividends to the country of reducing energy intensity. Our strategy to reduce energy intensity focuses&#13;
both on the supply and demand sides. On the supply side, the rehabilitation and modernization&#13;
program for existing facilities will lead to substantial reduction of losses. On the demand side, we&#13;
believe that correct pricing policies, and the on-going macroeconomic reform measures, will play an&#13;
important role in conserving energy. Additionally, our pursuit of industrial restructuring and&#13;
privatization will lead to significant energy savings.&#13;
In addition, it is the intention of GoR to promote aggressive public awareness of the benefits&#13;
of conservation, for which the Romanian Agency for Energy Conservation was established, in 1991.&#13;
Environment Protection&#13;
The GoR strongly believes that sustainable development requires environmental protection.&#13;
The Government has developed an environmental strategy with the assistance of the World Bank, and&#13;
other international agencies. The Government intends to implement the measures stated in strategy&#13;
document in the most economic manner, in order to minimize the environmental impact of the&#13;
production and use of electricity. The ecological aspect of the proposed Project is in conformity with&#13;
this strategy.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
The GoR is confident that the program outlined above will have a very positive impact on the&#13;
country's macroeconomic prospects. The Government is convinced that the implementation of the&#13;
Project is absolutely necessary for future efficient operation and development of electricity sector and&#13;
undertake the support of the World Bank for the program, through this and future projects, and looks&#13;
forward to a continued cooperative and successful dialogue which will assist in placing Romania on a&#13;
path to stable and sustained economic growth.&#13;

ROMANIA&#13;
POWER SECTOR REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF REHABILITATION CANDIDATES&#13;
Braila&#13;
1.     The power station is located on a 21 hectare site within the Chiscani agriculture area, approximately 13&#13;
km south of the town of Braila. Considerations in the siting of the station were the proximity of the River&#13;
Danube for supplies of cooling water, access to the rail network for delivery of fuel oil and easy access to the&#13;
gas supply system.&#13;
2.     Commissioning of Units 1 and 2, each of 210 MW capacity, took place during 1973. Unit 3 also of&#13;
210 MW capacity was commissioned in 1974 and the final phase to date, Unit 4, of 330 MW capacity, was&#13;
commissioned in 1979. The total station capacity is therefore 960 MW. There is space to extend the generating&#13;
capacity further by adding on to the turbine room and boiler house adjacent to Unit 4 and there exists a spare&#13;
flue gas duct entry point to further utilize No. 2 chimney.&#13;
3.     Unit 1 consists of two Ramzin type once through boilers each with an output of 325 tons per hour at&#13;
540°C, 137 bar supplying steam to a three cylinder reheat turbine. The boilers are designed for firing oil and&#13;
gas. The turbine systems include eight stages of feedwater heating and three off-takes for district heating. The&#13;
rated output of the turbine generators is 210 MW without any extraction for district heating. Cooling water and&#13;
raw water for the water treatment plant is taken from the River Danube and no cooling towers are installed.&#13;
Power is generated at 15.75 kV and 50 Hz and supplied to the switchyard at 220 kV via the generator&#13;
transformer. The generator cooling system utilizes hydrogen and water.&#13;
4.      The first three units were of Russian design; two half-duty boilers are provided for each&#13;
turbine-generator. Unit 4 is of Romanian manufacture based on a Deutsche Babcock boiler design and a Rateau&#13;
Schneider turbine design. All the boilers are of once-through type, and are designed to burn both oil and gas.&#13;
5.     Commissioning of Unit 1 was completed during 1973 and full design output was achieved during the&#13;
manufacturer's performance tests. The boilers were not fired on oil in the first two years and since then the&#13;
ratio of gas/oil firing has been in the ratio of about 77/23 percent heat input for Unit 1.&#13;
6.     In the period 1985-1992 (inclusive), the unit operated for an average of 80 percent of each year at an&#13;
average capacity factor of 64 percent. The highest availability occurred in 1983 when the unit operated for 98&#13;
percent of the year at an average capacity factor of 86 percent. The unit has operated for 134,467 hours until&#13;
being shut down for maintenance on 16 March 1993.&#13;
7.     The majority of operational problems on units 1-3 have been on the boiler plant and most of these&#13;
boiler problems are associated with oil firing.&#13;
8.     Unit 1 at Braila (and by extrapolation Units 2 and 3) are generally fit for continued service. They&#13;
require new burner systems, increased surveillance and some replacement of high temperature piping and for oil&#13;
firing the fitting of sootblowers and improved steam air heaters. The turbine needs some repairs to each of the&#13;
cylinders, and the generator needs a new exciter and some attention to the hydrogen sealing systems. The&#13;
condensate system requires replacement of many valves and some improvements to the design and control of the&#13;
feed water heaters. The control systems should be totally replaced and a major upgrade of the chemical services&#13;
is required.&#13;
Brazi&#13;
9.     Brazi Power Station is located approximately 12 km south of the city of Ploiesti and forms part of an&#13;
industrial complex of oil refineries and chemical plant. A prime consideration of the siting of the power station&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
70                                          Annex 3.1&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
was the availability of refinery crude and a natural gas supply from the adjacent oilfields. Water supply to the&#13;
site is provided from two sources. Boreholes supply 1/3 of station needs while the nearby river Prohova&#13;
supplies the remaining 2/3 of requirements. The industrial complex is situated on the main rail link between&#13;
Ploiesti and Bucharest.&#13;
10.    The Brazi installation consists of two power stations. Brazi 1, the older site, consists of nine&#13;
boiler/turbine units, the first of which was commissioned in 1961 (Unit 1) and the last (Unit 9) in 1972.&#13;
11.    Units 1-4 at Brazi 1 are 50 MW back-pressure units supplying process steam to the local refinery and&#13;
hot water (via steam/water heat exchangers) for district heating in Ploiesti. Units 5 and 6 are 100 MW&#13;
generating units while Unit 7 is a further 50 MW back-pressure unit supplying process steam. Units 8 and 9&#13;
are identical 200 MW generating units of a prototype design.&#13;
12.    Brazi 2 Power Station consists of one 50 MW back-pressure turbine supplied by two boilers of 420 t/h&#13;
capacity. In addition, there are four boilers of 100 t/h capacity and three boilers of 105 t/h capacity supplying&#13;
steam at 16 bar for the district heating scheme.&#13;
13.    Two smaller boilers of 50 t/h supply process steam at 35 bar, and one auxiliary boiler of unknown&#13;
capacity is available for site services.&#13;
14.    Brazi Unit No 9 comprises of a single boiler of 675 tfh capacity supplying steam to power a 200 MW&#13;
turbine-generator set.&#13;
15.    The boiler is of a La Mont design and includes an economizer, superheater, reheater and regenerative&#13;
air heater. Although designed to be fired on Romanian fuel, supply problems have led to the use of lower&#13;
grade imported fuel with a consequential deterioration in combustion parameters.&#13;
16.    The steam turbine consists of single high pressure, intermediate pressure and low pressure cylinders&#13;
with the steam being exhausted to an underslung dual flow condenser. Bled steam is extracted from various&#13;
points for use in the unit's five low pressure heaters, deaerator and two high pressure heaters which raise the&#13;
temperature of the feedwater prior to feeding it into the boiler.&#13;
17.    Electricity is generated at 15.75 kV/50 Hz and supplied to the switchyard via the generator&#13;
transformer. The generator cooling system uses hydrogen circulated within the stator casing.&#13;
18.    Unit No. 9 at Brazi I power station has only operated for the equivalent of eight years in its 20 year&#13;
history. Since being commissioned in 1972, the unit has experienced a number of problems which have&#13;
restricted operational times to those listed below.&#13;
1972 - 1974     6,400 hours&#13;
1974 - 1987    52,100 hours&#13;
1987 - 1992    14,000 hours&#13;
Total            73,300 hours&#13;
19.    Although it has been reported that the majority of problems experienced on the plant have been&#13;
associated with the boiler and fuel systems, aspects relating to unresolved design features, the use of unsuitable&#13;
fuel oils and the unavailability of fuel oil have also contributed to the low service factor.&#13;
Deva&#13;
20.    The power station is located on a 231 hectare site 7 km from the town of Deva in the South Eastem&#13;
part of Transylvania. Considerations in the siting of the station were access to the rail network for delivery of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7 1                                       Annex 3.1&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
coal from the mining areas of the Valea Jiuliu basins and proximity to the Mures River for supplies of cooling&#13;
water.&#13;
21.    Construction of the station commenced in 1964 with the commissioning of the first stage of four Units&#13;
in the period 1969-1971. Unit 5 was commissioned in 1977 while the final development was the commnissioning&#13;
of Unit 6 in 1980. The total design and supply of the first stage was from the USSR, while stages 2 and 3&#13;
include equipment of Romanian manufacture.&#13;
22.    The six units are each of 210 MW output and are arranged for independent operation with a combined&#13;
output of 1,260 MW. All Units are virtually identical and consist of two boilers each supplying steam to a&#13;
single 210 MW turbine generator.&#13;
23.    The boilers are of the once-through type and include an economizer, superheater, reheater and tubular&#13;
air heater and precipitators.&#13;
24.    The boilers are designed for firing coal having a heating value of about 3500 kCal/kg (15.4 MJ/kg)&#13;
with natural gas or fuel oil as a supplementary fuel for start up and flame stabilization.&#13;
25.    Each turbine consists of one high pressure cylinder, one intermediate pressure cylinder and one double&#13;
flow low pressure cylinder. Steam is exhausted to a split condenser with bled steam extracted to four low&#13;
pressure heaters, a deaerator and three high pressure heaters. Bled steam from the intermediate pressure&#13;
cylinder also passes to heat exchangers that heat the circulating district heating water.&#13;
26.    Condenser cooling water is provided from the river or from forced draught evaporative cooling. Make-&#13;
up water is supplied from the river via a common water treatment plant and each Unit is fitted with a&#13;
condensate polishing plant.&#13;
27.    Power is generated at 15.75 kV, 50 Hz and supplied to the switchyard at 220 kV via&#13;
generator transformers. The generator cooling system utilizes demineralized water for stator cooling and&#13;
hydrogen for rotor cooling. The generator is directly driven from the turbine at 3000 rev/min. Power is&#13;
exported to the grid at 110 kV and 220 kV.&#13;
28.    Development of Mintia power station at Deva, in Transylvania commenced with the construction of the&#13;
first four 210 MW brown coal fired units in the late 1960s. Design, manufacture and construction supervision&#13;
was almost entirely by manufacturers from the former USSR, and in common with much Russian equipment&#13;
was generally extremely robust. Although automatic control systems were included, the Russian technology is&#13;
of a type that was outmoded by Western European standards even when new. Each Unit consists of two&#13;
once-through Benson type boilers supplying steam to a single reheat turbine.&#13;
29.    Unit 1 started operation in 1969 closely followed by Units 2-4. Subsequent development saw&#13;
commissioning of two further 210 MW Units (5 and 6) in 1977 and 1980 basically to the same design, but with&#13;
a much higher Romanian content. The station therefore now consists of six similar units with a combined&#13;
capacity of 1260 MW.&#13;
30.    Unit 1 turbine has generally operated whenever available since commissioning and has run for 171, 000&#13;
hours to date. The boilers have run for 164,000 and 161,000 hours to date having on occasions being shut&#13;
down for repairs or to reduce generation while the turbine remains on load.&#13;
31.    Overall availability has averaged about 85 per cent with an average capacity factor of about 60 per&#13;
cent. The station claim the Unit is still able to generate 210 MW when required although average output when&#13;
operating is considerably below this and full load was not observed during the inspection period.&#13;
32.    Operating data have not shown discernible trends in the last few years. Major renovations occurred in&#13;
1988 followed by continuous operation at low load in 1989. In 1990 and 1991, there were periods of standby&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72                                         Annex 3.1&#13;

and plant outages. Performance in 1992 to the time of the outage was better than the immediately preceding&#13;
years. Over the life of the station the availability has remained high whereas there has been some decline in&#13;
capacity factor. This would seem to indicate that the output of the Unit has in fact deteriorated.&#13;
33.    Fuel supply quality has varied over the years, often due to non technical decisions. However, the&#13;
station now seem to be obtaining fuel of a quality suitable for the Units. Gas consumption has averaged about&#13;
25 per cent of total fuel usage and is judged to be higher than necessary to sustain the coal flame.&#13;
34.    The record of runmning hours indicates that most outages were planned. However, the durations and&#13;
frequency are erratic and indicate that regular schedules of planned maintenance have not necessarily been&#13;
adhered to. There are several maintenance activities such as the frequent replacement of pump impellers that,&#13;
while not considered a problem by the power station staff, cause excessive maintenance activities. Many of&#13;
these types of problem would be overcome by the use of good quality replacement parts or by eliminating the&#13;
cause of the problem.&#13;
35.    The site is well placed in regard to the rail system, river water supplies and the local load demands for&#13;
metal ore mining and general industry. The long established mining industry and what was perceived to be a&#13;
high level of education and generally well organized local infrastructure in the district should ensure a suitable&#13;
source of personnel for the plant. The general impression was of a keen and interested staff endeavoring to&#13;
operate as well as possible in difficult circumstances. However, the future will require enhanced personnel&#13;
training and a more reasoned financial approach to preventative maintenance and plant item replacement.&#13;
Bucharest South&#13;
36.    The Bucharest South combined heat and power station is located on a 60 hectare site on the southeast&#13;
side of the city of Bucharest, approximately 15 km from the city center. The station is located close to the rail&#13;
network for delivery of fuel oil, and to the electrical power and district heating loads in the city of Bucharest.&#13;
Construction of the station commenced in 1965, with the installation of two 50 MW combined heat and power&#13;
(CHP) sets. The second phase of construction, in 1967 added two further CHP sets of 100 MW capacity. The&#13;
final phase of construction in 1978, increased the capacity of the station to a total of 550 MW, with the&#13;
installation of two 125 MW CHP sets. Unit 3 and 4 are of similar design and layout.&#13;
37.    Bucharest-Sud Unit 4 comprises a 420 tonne per hour boiler supplying steam to a common range and a&#13;
100 MW turbo-generator.&#13;
38.    The boilers are of the conventional steam drum type with double gas pass, and include an economizer,&#13;
furnace, superheater, and rotary regenerative air heater.&#13;
39.    The boilers are designed for the firing natural gas and fuel oil. The original design allowed for 100 per&#13;
cent capacity on gas. Full production on natural gas only has not been achieved since the time of the&#13;
performance tests, as there has not been sufficient gas available. This is a result of rapidly escalating gas&#13;
demnand, mainly for fertilizer production, without a corresponding development of the gas supply system.&#13;
40.    The turbine consists of a single high pressure cylinder, a single intermediate pressure cylinder and a&#13;
single double flow. Low pressure cylinder. Steam is exhausted to a split condenser and bled steam is extracted&#13;
to four low pressure heaters, a deaerator, three high pressure heaters and a district heating system. Condenser&#13;
cooling water is provided from evaporative cooling towers.&#13;
41.    Make-up water is extracted from the industrial network of the district heating system which takes its&#13;
supply from the nearby Cernica Lake and the Arges river. Additionally, the facility exists to extract make up&#13;
supplies from the town drinking water system. The make up water requirement is supplied from a common&#13;
water treatment plant comprising pre-treatment, coagulation, softening and demineralization facilities.&#13;
&#13;

Page 5 of 9&#13;
42.    Power is generated at 10.5 kV and 50 Hz and supplied to the switchyard at 110 kV via the generator&#13;
transformer. The generator cooling system utilizes hydrogen and water.&#13;
43.    Construction of Unit 4 commenced in 1965 with commissioning completed during 1967. Design of the&#13;
boilers was by CKO and that of the turbine generator by Turbomotorii Zavod (TMZ), both of Russia. Full&#13;
design output was achieved during the manufacturers' performance tests and after some initial problems average&#13;
annual output of around 90 MW, or 90 per cent of design, was achieved in the late 1960s with the turbine&#13;
operating some 8085 and the boiler operating some 7966 hours per year. Since that time the average annual&#13;
output has slowly declined, although the annual running hours have remained fairly constant. At present, near&#13;
design output is occasionally achieved but is not usually sustained for more than about one hour.&#13;
44.    The RENEL electrical system was operated between 47.5 Hz and 48.5 from 1983 to 1989, and this has&#13;
had an effect on the condition of some equipment.&#13;
45.    The Unit first generated significant power in November, 1967. Full design output was achieved during&#13;
the manufacturers performance tests, and following some initial problems an average annual output of 90&#13;
percent was achieved in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&#13;
46.    Since that time, the boiler has operated for around 81 percent of every year and the turbo-generator for&#13;
around 76 percent of every year at an in service average load of 61 MW. The boiler and turbo-generator have&#13;
accumulated some 182,000 and 176,000 hours of operation, respectively to date.&#13;
47.    Since the exhaustion of plant spares from the original suppliers, more reliance has, by necessity, had to&#13;
be placed on locally produced equipment of less than adequate quality. This has led to ever increasing&#13;
maintenance problems which often have a knock on effect, resulting in problems elsewhere on the plant.&#13;
48.    Over the years, various parts of the plant have been modified or taken out of commnission. This has&#13;
had an effect on operational flexibility and plant efficiency to varying degrees. However, to reinstate the plant&#13;
as new may not be necessary or cost effective. A review of the heat cycle and mass balance in relation to the&#13;
anticipated operating regime and fuel quality is required before committing to major expenditure.&#13;
49.    The quality of fuel oil supplied to the station varies from day to day, but is invariably worse than&#13;
design, with a significantly higher sulphur content. The low quality of the fuel represent a major impediment to&#13;
the achievement of full power, while the high sulphur content results in increased levels of corrosion and&#13;
environmental pollution.&#13;
50.    The original design allowed for 100 percent firing of natural gas and fuel oil. However, full&#13;
production on gas in isolation is seldom achieved, as gas is no longer regularly available in sufficient quantities.&#13;
51.    The turbine has operated for an average of 76 percent of the time in the twenty-four years of operation,&#13;
and as it is believed that it has always been run when available this equates to the overall availability. The&#13;
overall capacity factor for the unit has averaged 61 percent over the operating period.&#13;
52.    The boiler has slightly higher operating hours at 81 percent over the twenty-four years of operation.&#13;
Again, this is assumed to equate to the actual availability. The capacity factor for the boilers is not known.&#13;
53.    Overall, the site is well placed in regard to the rail system, river water supplies and district heating and&#13;
electrical load center of Bucharest. The level of industry in the district, and the universities should ensure a&#13;
suitable source of personnel for the plant, where the general feeling was one of a keen and interested staff&#13;
endeavoring to operate the plant as efficiently as possible in difficult circumstances. If plant is enhanced,&#13;
however, personnel training and a more disciplined approach to preventative maintenance will be required in the&#13;
future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74                                           Annex 3.1&#13;
Page 6 of 9&#13;
54.    The conclusion of the investigations and detailed discussions with the station staff is that Bucharest-Sud&#13;
Unit 4, (and by extrapolation Unit 3), could be subject to major plant failures in the next five years with the&#13;
potential to put future viability of the unit in question. However, a moderate level of rehabilitation work in the&#13;
next few years could allow for many years of continued operation.&#13;
55.    From the technical evaluation, it is concluded that medium-term rehabilitation, giving 5-15 years of&#13;
life, would require almost as much investment as a full life extension of 15-25 years.&#13;
56.    It is also important to note that several items of plant may require redesign or modification from the&#13;
original. This could necessitate the recalculation of the unit heat balance and the establishment of a substantial&#13;
level of confidence in the quality and availability of the fuels to be utilized for future operation. In view of the&#13;
age of the plant, a return to the as-built condition is not necessarily a practical or sensible solution.&#13;
57.    The specification and procurement procedures for high quality materials, spares and replacement&#13;
equipment needs to be established together with appropriate quality control and assurance. The current&#13;
philosophy of repair needs to change from the frequent and repetitive on-site repair with inferior materials and&#13;
facilities to one of infrequent replacements with high quality reliable equipment. Personnel training needs to be&#13;
increased to reflect modern best work practices and operating methods.&#13;
Isalnita&#13;
58.    The power station is located on a 52 hectare site within the Isalnita industrial complex, approximately&#13;
10 km north west of the city of Craiova. The station is located close to the rail network for delivery of lignite&#13;
from the mining areas of the Oltenia basin; to the River Jiu for supplies of cooling water; and to the electrical&#13;
power and district heating loads in the Craiova district.&#13;
59.    Construction of the station commenced in 1964, with the installation of two 100 MW condensing sets&#13;
and three 50 MW combined heat and power (CHP) sets. The second phase of construction, in 1967-1968,&#13;
increased the capacity of the station to a total of 1030 MW, with the installation of two 315 MW condensing&#13;
sets and an additional 50 MW CHP set.&#13;
60.    Isalnita Unit 7 (and, similarly Unit 8) comprises two boilers each supplying steam to a single 315 MW&#13;
turbine generator.&#13;
61.    The boilers are of the Benson, or once-through, type and each includes an econornizer, superheater,&#13;
reheater and rotary regenerative air heater.&#13;
62.    The boilers are designed for firing lignite and/or natural gas. The design allowed for 100 per cent gas&#13;
firing but this has not been achieved since the time of the performance tests (1969), as there has not been&#13;
sufficient gas available. This is a result of rapidly escalating gas demand mainly for fertilizer production&#13;
without a corresponding development of the gas supply system.&#13;
63.    The turbine consists of a single high pressure stage, a single intermediate pressure stage and two low&#13;
pressure stages. Steam is exhausted to a split condenser and bled steam is extracted to three low pressure&#13;
heaters, a deaerator and six high pressure heaters. Condenser cooling water is provided from the river and&#13;
evaporative cooling towers.&#13;
64.    Make-up water is supplied from the River Jiu via a common water treatment plant. Units 7 and 8 are&#13;
each fitted with a condensate polishing plant.&#13;
65.    Power is generated at 24 kV and 50 Hz and supplied to the switchyard at 220 kV via the generator&#13;
transformer. The generator cooling system utilizes hydrogen and water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
75                                          Annex 3.1&#13;
Page 7 of 9&#13;
66.    Construction of Unit 7 commenced in 1967 with commissioning completed during 1969. Design of the&#13;
boilers was by MAN of West Germany and that of the turbine generator by Rateu-Schneider of France. Full&#13;
design output was achieved during the manufacturers' perfornance tests and after some initial problems average&#13;
annual output of around 250 MW or 80 per cent of design was achieved in the early 1970s with the unit&#13;
operating some 8000 hours per year. Since that time the average annual output has slowly declined although the&#13;
annual running hours have remained fairly constant. At present near design output is occasionally achieved, but&#13;
is not usually sustained for more than about one hour.&#13;
67.    Coal quality varies from day to day and is usually less than that on which the design was based. The&#13;
station staff attribute this as the major impediment to achieving full power. Although the availability appears&#13;
good there are numerous short duration shut downs of one half of the boiler pairs which considerably reduces&#13;
overall output.&#13;
68.    The main plant, that is the boilers and turbine generator set, were designed and manufactured in&#13;
Western Germany and France respectively, the boilers being of the once-through design. The plant represents&#13;
an advanced design with high steam conditions and having accumulated some 186,000 operating hours, the&#13;
materials in the areas designed to time dependent criteria, eg creep or fatigue, will have consumed a high&#13;
proportion of their design lives. Thus, while it will be possible to maintain the unit in operation with normal&#13;
overhauls, and piecemeal replacements, as and when failures of different sections occur, if the plant is to have a&#13;
sustained extension to its operating life, fairly substantial replacements of essential components will be&#13;
necessary.&#13;
69.    The fuel used in the boiler plant is predominantly lignite with high moisture and ash contents which has&#13;
resulted in the milling and burner systems becoming dilapidated and requiring urgent attention leading to&#13;
renewal, preferably with re-designed equipment. The abrasive character of the ash in the fuel has also resulted&#13;
in severe erosion of furnace, superheater, reheater and economizer tubes and extensive renewal of these sections&#13;
is recommended.&#13;
70.    Similarly, the abrasive fuel has resulted in extensive wear in the airheaters and the induced draft fans,&#13;
the erosion of the latter being accelerated because of the inadequate electrostatic precipitator plant. Renewal of&#13;
the precipitators and of the draft plant is recommended for extended service and it is essential that early&#13;
attention be given to the precipitators with a view to providing plant of adequate size and performnance.&#13;
71.    In general, the turbine is in good condition but in accordance with the previous remarks, attention will&#13;
have to be given to the time dependent areas in order to give a substantial extension to the service life. The&#13;
main areas involved would be the high temperature bolts, steam chests, journal and thrust bearings but detailed&#13;
examination should also be made periodically of the rotors and cylinders, to ascertain the stage at which renewal&#13;
might be desirable to give extended life and better thermal performance.&#13;
72.    The condenser and feed systems are in reasonable condition subject to their having complete routine&#13;
overhauls and replacement of some detailed sections such as the air extraction system, and the cooling water&#13;
screening system should be re-instated in order to improve condenser performance.&#13;
73.    Both the stator and the rotor require rewinding. The auxiliary electrical systems within the boiler and&#13;
turbine house were found to be generally in poor repair and in need of major refurbishment, the protection&#13;
equipment is obsolete and in need of replacement and the standby generator requires a full overhaul.&#13;
74.    The quality of coal delivered to site has resulted in the coal handling plant requiring extensive&#13;
refurbishment and in many cases some new equipment. Extensive belt renewal will be necessary, and we also&#13;
think that the hydraulic couplings in the motor drives should be renewed with advantage to the operators.&#13;
75.    The control systems are out of date, in very poor condition and the majority of the control loops are no&#13;
longer capable of automatic operation. With such an advanced design of main plant it is essential that urgent&#13;
attention be given to the control system and indeed that the entire system requires replacement by equipment of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
76                                        Annex 3.1&#13;
Page 8 of 9&#13;
modem reliable design. The availability of a satisfactory control system would have very valuable influences on&#13;
the efficiency of operation of the plant and of the safety of the installation.&#13;
76.    With advanced steam cycle conditions, it is essential that adequate water treatment plant and chemical&#13;
dosing facilities are available. The make up water and the cooling water for this site are both extracted from&#13;
the River Jiul with high suspended solids. This together with the inadequate water treatment plant results in&#13;
unsatisfactory operation and therefore we recommend that an extensive renewal and rehabilitation exercise be&#13;
adopted for the water treatment plant and chemical services.&#13;
77.    Apart from the boiler unit where there is a severe deterioration evident arising from the quality of the&#13;
fuel with highly abrasive properties, and which will necessitate extensive replacement, and some re-design of&#13;
the firing equipment, the remainder of the plant is basically in an operable condition. However, because of the&#13;
extended number of hours of operation, it is evident that attention will be needed to all of the plant if&#13;
operational reliability is to be sustained and a satisfactory life extension achieved; an example is the&#13;
recommended rewinding of the generator stator and rotor.&#13;
78.    Furthermore, in order to achieve reliability attention needs to be given on an urgent basis to some of&#13;
the ancillary equipment, in particular the controls and water treatment plant.&#13;
Palas&#13;
79.    Palas Power Station is located in the industrial area situated to the south of the city of Constanta. Fuel&#13;
oil is supplied by twin 219 mm OD x 2.5 km long pipelines from Oil Terminal SA who are located within the&#13;
same industrial area.      °&#13;
80.    Construction of the station commenced on 1 March 1966 with the installation of two&#13;
50 MW combined heat and power sets. The second phase of the construction in 1974 to 1979 increased the&#13;
capacity of the station to a total of 250 MW (215 MW power) with the installation of a 115 MW/150 MW&#13;
combined heat and power set.&#13;
81.    The Unit 3 boiler is a 115 MW/150 MW once through design with reheat by Mannesmann Rohrbau&#13;
AG of Dusseldorf, West Germany and built under license by Vulcan, Bucharest.&#13;
82.    The boiler is designed to fire on fuel oil and rated at 525 tonne/hour of steam at 192 bar at a&#13;
temperature of 5400C. It is a pressurized fumace design and does not have induced draught flue gas fans. The&#13;
turbine was the first of three of this particular design manufactured by IMGB Romania and is rated at 150 MW&#13;
or 115 MW plus 165 GCal/hour thermal output for district heating. Unit 3 is a three cylinder tandem&#13;
compound machine with reheat, seven stages of feed heating and two bleed points for district heating supply.&#13;
83.    Power is generated at 15.75 kV and 50 Hz supplied to the indoor substation at 124 kV via the&#13;
generator transformer. The generator cooling system utilizes hydrogen and water.&#13;
84.    Commissioning of Unit 3 took place in 1979 and we understand from the station that the boiler has&#13;
never achieved its rated output of 525 tonne/hour of steam.&#13;
85.    The unit has operated for a total of 29,927 hours which is only about 12 percent of its design life. It&#13;
was last operated in May 1992 for 6 hours.&#13;
86.    The machine has been subjected to some 200 starts and the total number of forced outages of the unit is&#13;
182. Most of the outages have ben attributed to the boiler with approximately 80 to the turbine and associated&#13;
plant. However, the majority of the latter outages originate from boiler problems.&#13;
87.    Shut-downs have been mainly attributed to high vibration levels on the turbine and boiler tube failures&#13;
mainly in the vaporizer (furnace) and superheater areas. From the first run-up, bearing vibration levels were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 9 of 9&#13;
very high, particularly at the low pressure bearing pedestal No. 6. The vibration levels recorded were in the&#13;
range 70 jtm pk/pk - 160 um pk/pk and although several strip-downs have taken place in the last ten years, no&#13;
significant improvement has been achieved.&#13;
88.    Unit No 3 has never operated satisfactorily and it has only run for approximately 12.5 percent of the&#13;
design life.&#13;
89.    The boiler requires significant rehabilitation work in order to provide an improved performance.&#13;
90.    The turbine also requires rehabilitation in order to provide a critical speed well removed from the&#13;
running speed. This may entail provision of a complete new high pressure rotor.&#13;
91.    Most of the balance of plant is in a satisfactory condition for continued service, as would be expected&#13;
after only 29,000 hours operation. However, close attention should be given to the water treatment plant in&#13;
order to provide the high purity make-up water required for a once-through boiler.&#13;
Conversion to coal&#13;
92.    The boiler plant of four units in two power stations (Iasi II and Suceava ) will be redesigned to allow&#13;
for coal firing instead of the present local lignite. This conversion will comprise, among other things,&#13;
modifications/redesign of the coal mills, bunkers, thermal loads, burning system, evaporation sections, airflow,&#13;
electrofilters, ash handling and the replacement of the control of the units. The summary description of the&#13;
power plants is given below.&#13;
ISl 11&#13;
93.    Iasi II is a CHP plant located in a 49 hectare site within the city of Iasi in the north-east of Rormania. It&#13;
provides electricity at 110 kV to national grid and hot water to the Iasi city district heating system.&#13;
94.    The power station comprises of two boilers designed by ICPET ( Design Institute for Thermal Plant)&#13;
to produce up to 420 tonne/hour of steam at 137 bar, 540 degrees C. The boilers were manufactured by Vulcan.&#13;
The two turbines were manufactured by IMGB; both are rated at 50 MW. The generators are hydrogen cooled,&#13;
75 MVA, .8 power factor allowing for 60 MW of output. The first boiler was commissioned in 1986 and has&#13;
operated for 37700 hours; the second 1988 and 27600 hours respectively. They were designed to fire lignite of&#13;
1550 kcal/kg (net) with fuel oil support. The fuel oil capability is 50% of the boiler load, but the plant normally&#13;
operates with 10% oil and 90% lignite. Oil support is required all times. There are six beater type coal mills in&#13;
each boiler.&#13;
Suceava&#13;
95.    The power station is located on a 45 hecatre site near the city of Suceava in the north of Romania. The&#13;
units have similar design and same manufacturers as lasi II. The first unit was commissioned in 1987 and has&#13;
34700 hours of operation; the second 1989 and 27100 respectively.&#13;

ROMANIA&#13;
POWER SECTOR REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT COST ESTIMATES&#13;
Capital cost estimates were made by the Consultants who inspected the sample units to provide for&#13;
extension of the life of the units by 50,000, 100,000 and 150,000 hours. The original estimates reflect early&#13;
1993 price levels (updadated to January 1995), and they presuppose procurement by ICB with the contractors&#13;
improving their competitive positions by making use of the low cost local industry and labor whenever quality&#13;
can be assured.&#13;
The basic estimate comprise the capital expenditure on the dismantling and removal of equipment to be&#13;
replaced, on the renovation, where appropriate, of existing equipment and on the provision and installation of&#13;
replacement equipment. The details of the repair and renewal work to be done, as identified by the Consultants&#13;
during inspection work, are set out in the Consultant's report in the Project file.&#13;
The estimates of basic cost have been arrived at in a two-stage process. First, costs were estimated by&#13;
reference to the Consultants' own database and by inquiry of Western manufacturers. It is noted, however, that&#13;
virtually all the inspected plant was designed and manufactured in Romania or elsewhere in Eastern Europe.&#13;
Costs in Eastern Europe in general and in Romania in particular, are lower than in Western Europe. The&#13;
Consultants have attempted to quantify the likely effect on prices of the above indicated local participation.&#13;
Budget prices received from Romanian enterprises, and other information indicate a discount relative to&#13;
Western prices of up to 30 percent. From the Consultant inspection work in the power stations, however, it&#13;
was verified that quality control in the power engineering sector in Romania is, or was, poor. On the other&#13;
hand, based on brief visits made to Romanian factories, it is believe that they are capable of matching the&#13;
standards of their Western counterparts; but in doing so, the Consultant expect some diminution in the current&#13;
price advantage. Therefore, it is reasonable to allow for a discount of 20 percent relative to Western prices for&#13;
power plant equipment, except for such equipment as controls and instrumentation, which should be specified to&#13;
be of Western origin.&#13;
For life extensions of 100,000 and 150,000 hours cost estimates include the installation of low NOx&#13;
burners and, for lignite/coal burning plant, complete rehabilitation of the precipitator plant. For life extent of&#13;
50,000 hours, the provision made depend on the efficiency of the existing burners and precipitators. There was&#13;
no allowance for the retrofitting of FGD equipment. Engineering, project management and site supervision was&#13;
estimated at about 6 percent of base cost.&#13;
Discussions with Romania equipment manufacturers and local quality assurance groups revealed that the&#13;
foreign contents of locally manufactured equipment in order to meet international standards of quality, would be&#13;
high, as much as 40-50% of the original estimates of the local costs. The foreign exchange cost component&#13;
takes account of the indirect foreign exchange cost due to the foreign inputs for local manufacture. As a result,&#13;
the foreign exchange costs account for about 65 % of the total base cost for the various units to be rehabilitated.&#13;
Physical contingencies of 15 percent were used all through the rehabilitation works. This high value is&#13;
due to the uncertainty inherent to these type of estimation. For example, the Consultants did not have the&#13;
opportunity to see all plant dismantled, or to carry out non-destructive tests (NDT) and other evaluations on all&#13;
the potentially critical high temperature or high stress areas. This high contingencies is intended to cover costs&#13;
of additional work that might come to light by the time the specifications are being prepared or during the actual&#13;
execution of the work, in addition to covering the uncertainties in the basic cost estimates.&#13;
Price contingencies are calculated by applying the Index of Unit Value of Manufactured Exports (from&#13;
the G-5 countries) to the base cost plus the physical contingencies in accordance with Bank methodology.&#13;

Implementing Arrangements&#13;
4.    Implementation responsibility for the Power Sector Reform Program will be with Mol while&#13;
the Thermal Plant Rehabilitation Program and Corporate Restructuring Program will be the&#13;
responsibility of RENEL. RENEL has established a Project Implementation Department to carry out&#13;
all rehabilitation and renovation works at its plants and transmission systems. The following actions&#13;
have also been taken to ensure successful project implementation:&#13;
(a)    GoR has established an Intenninisterial Steering Committee to oversee the design and&#13;
implementation of the Power Sector Reform Program, for which the MoI's Directorate&#13;
General for Electricity and Thermal Energy will serve as the secretariat,;&#13;
(b)    RENEL will ensure that the Project Implementation Department in RENEL will&#13;
continue to be adequately staffed and funded in a manner satisfactory to the Bank;&#13;
(c)    RENEL has established a Corporate Restructuring Committee under the President to&#13;
oversee the design and implementation of RENEL Corporate Restructuring Program;&#13;
(d)    RENEL has prepared a program for improvements in environmental management in&#13;
RENEL, including eventually, the establishment of a department devoted to&#13;
environmental concerns, the definition of its main functions and of its relations with&#13;
the other departments. By December 1995, RENEL will appoint consultants, under&#13;
terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, to assist in implementing the systems,&#13;
including training of RENEL staff, and assistance in implementing occupational health&#13;
and safety programs at headquarters and all thermal power generating facilities,&#13;
including training of RENEL staff&#13;
5.    The role of the Bank during project implementation is in section H of Chapter 3 of the SAR.&#13;
A first measure of success of project implementation will be that all major contracts for the&#13;
rehabilitation of power plants are awarded by March 1997.&#13;
Implementation Plan&#13;
6.    The time-bound detailed implementation plan for each project component, including technical&#13;
assistance and training is provided in the tables attached to this Annex showing the Schedule of&#13;
procurement actions, including targets dates for each package under the project;&#13;
7.    Detailed project cost estimated are provided in Annex 3.2, and forecast disbursement for each&#13;
item financed under the project are provided on page 10;&#13;
8.    Provisions for setting up project accounting and financial management are found in Chapter 4&#13;
of the SAR. The establishment of the Special Accounts are in Chapter 3 of the SAR.&#13;
Project Monitoring and Bank Supervision&#13;
9.    To enable monitoring GoR and RENEL will prepare quarterly progress reports on the&#13;
respective components. In addition, RENEL will be asked to: a) prepare beginning with financial&#13;
year 1996, a rolling 5-year corporate plan each year; and b) recruit internationally reputable private&#13;
auditors to audit the utility's financial accounts and corporate performance. The form, content and&#13;
timetable for the submission of these reports to the Bank will be confirmed with Mol and RENEL&#13;
respectively at negotiations.&#13;

11.    A comprehensive Environmental Strategy Paper (ESP)' was prepared by the Bank and the Govemment,&#13;
with the participation of other intemational bilateral and multilateral agencies in 1992, to define an&#13;
environmental strategy for Romania that will (i) in the short term, reduce, in the most economic manner,&#13;
current and likely severe impacts of environmental degradation on human health; and (b) build up a framework&#13;
which will foster a long term economically sustainable environment. The environmental aspects of the proposed&#13;
Project are designed to meet these objectives. An environmental analysis (EA) was prepared by foreign&#13;
consultants for the Government to assess the magnitude of potential environmental impacts of the proposed&#13;
project and to recommend measures to include in the Project to mitigate any serious pollution impact from&#13;
future operations.&#13;
12.    Against the above background, the EA has analyzed the extent of the pollution impact due to the&#13;
rehabilitation and life extension, and actions on fuel switching, and unit retirement program. At some of the&#13;
individual power plants, the combined effects of higher availability, increased power output at will lead to slight&#13;
increases in emissions even at improved fuel use efficiencies, whereas at most others the incremental pollution&#13;
will be less. The net effect is dramatic reductions in the emissions of all pollutants. Table I compares&#13;
emissions levels pre- and post-rehabilitation. The EA proposed mitigating measures that are to be implemented&#13;
under the proposed Project are identified below.&#13;

Recommended Mitigation Measures and Monitoring&#13;
Mitigating Measures&#13;
13     The technical and economic solutions that will be implemented as part of the rehabilitation activities&#13;
will lead to reduction of pollution. These encompass:&#13;
(a)    introduction of low NOx bumers and improvements in combustion systems will lead to&#13;
reductions of NOx emissions in addition to the elimination of the problem of severe corrosion&#13;
and damage to steam boilers;&#13;
(b)    improvements in fuel use efficiency through the rehabilitation of major unit components -&#13;
boilers, turbines and generators- will lead to decreases in fuel consumption and pollutant&#13;
emissions;&#13;
(c)    conversion to use of imported (low sulfur) hard coal at 11 lignite fired units primarily for&#13;
economic reasons will lead to reductions in all pollutants from these units.&#13;
(d)    conversion to use of light fuel oil (about 1 % sulphur content) instead of heavy fuel oil&#13;
containing sulphur of 3-4% and high content of corrosive impurities (notably vanadium), to&#13;
improve operational life and performance of boilers, and save on maintenance costs will lead&#13;
to significant reductions in NOx and S02. Recognizing the cost savings and the environmental&#13;
benefits, RENEL had agreed to switch to use of light, fuel oil presently used in its oil-fired&#13;
boilers.&#13;
14.    As a specific environmental improvement measure, rehabilitation and modemization of ESPs&#13;
at Isalnita, Deva, and at the stations to be converted from lignite to hard coal to raise operational efficiency&#13;
levels to 98-99%, will reduce fly-ash and particulate emissions.&#13;
15.    In addition, the above measures will lead to reductions in CO2 emissions, and Romania's contribution to&#13;
global warming. Since Romania is net importer of transboundary S02 emissions, these actions will lead to&#13;
Romania improving its transboundary pollution impact relative to the other countries. Estimates of Annual&#13;
Potential Pollutant Emission Reductions are provided in Table 1.&#13;

16.    In accordance with OD 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), this project has been assigned to Category B.&#13;
Since the project seeks to improve environmental performance of thermal power generation operations at a&#13;
number of specific stations, this rating is deemed justified. Results presented in Table 1 support this view. The&#13;
environmental analysis discussed earlier was designed to establish how these improvements were to be&#13;
accomplished in the most cost-effective manner.&#13;

the procurement activities putting together the complete bidding documents for each&#13;
package, advertisement of tenders, prequalification procedures, bid appraisal, award&#13;
recommendations, contract discussions, contract monitoring and closing. The&#13;
Procurement and Contracts Deputy Director will be represented in all planning&#13;
activities of the Department proving inputs in this area of expertise. This Manager&#13;
will also monitor closely all the activities of the project that have a bearing on the&#13;
procurement and on the contracts' economy.&#13;
D Deputy Director for Budget and Finance will be responsible for the overall and&#13;

monitoring of the project activities.&#13;
The Head office staff will be assisted at the sites by Site Managers who, together with the&#13;
Consultant, will supervise the Contractors. The Site team under the Site Manager may vary from site&#13;
to site but will always include a planning engineer in charge of closely monitor the project site&#13;
activities. The team may include, as needed, mechanical and electrical engineers as well as support&#13;
from accountants and secretarial staff.&#13;
A Quality Assurance group will work directly under the Department Head so that its&#13;
recommendations are necessarily considered in the development of project. For specific and difficult&#13;
problems the Department Head may convene "ad hoc" technical advisory groups to recommend&#13;
solutions. Organizational chart of the PID is attached.&#13;

The above fuel prices are expected to remain stable in US$ terms. The&#13;
details of fuel consumption by type of fuel and the resulting Fuel&#13;
Costs, are provided in Attachment 2 to this Annex.&#13;
8.    Power Purchase Cost: No imports are envisaged during the forecast period, and RENEL will&#13;
buy electricity from the (to be separated) nuclear entity form 1996&#13;
onwards. For the base case, a US cents 3/kWh power purchase cost is&#13;
assumed.&#13;
9.    Salaries and Wages:   For 1995, salaries and wages would account for 0.75 US cents/kWh&#13;
sold (i.e. 10% lower than 1994 to take into account a 10% reduction&#13;
in personnel in 1994), and would remain at these levels in constant&#13;
US$ terms thereafter, which means a reduction in salaries and wages&#13;
equal to the annual international inflation. From 1996 on, the salaries&#13;
and wages of nuclear personnel is excluded.&#13;
10.   Operations &amp; Maintenance:   In 1994, 0 &amp; M expenses amounted to 0.40 US cents/kWh&#13;
and this level is expected to remain stable.&#13;

11.   Other Operating Costs:      Includes management overheads, travel, training and&#13;
miscellaneous operating expenses; expected to increase by 2%&#13;
each year.&#13;
12.   Debt Service:               Service of existing debt projected on the basis of contractual&#13;
terms and the debt service on future loans are on the basis of&#13;
prevailing terms which are provided in Attachment 3 to this&#13;
Annex. From 1996 the debt service on Cermavoda loans is&#13;
excluded.&#13;
13.   Income Taxes:               RENEL is liable for taxes at 38% of taxable income, plus&#13;
90% of net profits have to be paid to the Government.&#13;
RENEL and Mol have avoided payment of these high levels of&#13;
taxes by artificially increasing the operating costs by a&#13;
"Development Tax" through specific legislation. The&#13;
Development Tax, which in effect is additional depreciation,&#13;
was 8% of revenues in 1993 and was increased in 1994 to&#13;
12%, to avoid taxes and to leave resources for investments.&#13;
MoF tacitly approves the idea of a development levy, since the&#13;
present Romanian income tax laws do not allow for an&#13;
investment allowance. Therefore, it is assumed that RENEL&#13;
will not be liable for income taxes throughout the forecast&#13;
period.&#13;

at least 30% of its average annual capital expenditures (averaged over the previous, current and the&#13;
immediate next years), and (b) ensure that RENEL's DSCR is not less than 1.5. The definitions of&#13;
terms used are:&#13;
(a)    capital expenditures include all investments related to RENEL's electricity and thermal energy&#13;
operations. Interest and other charges to construction shall be excluded.&#13;
(b)    Local costs of its capital expenditures are the expenditures incurred by RENEL in&#13;
local currency (Lei) for local materials, goods, services, environmental abatement,&#13;
rehabilitation, new capacity development, etc.&#13;
(d)   internal sources of funds means the difference between: the sum of net revenues of&#13;
RENEL and reductions in working capital other than cash; and the sum of debt-&#13;
service and increases in working capital other than cash.&#13;
(e)    Net revenues are the difference between: the sum of revenues from all sources&#13;
related to operations and net non-operating income; and the sum of all expenses&#13;
related to operations including administration, adequate maintenance, taxes and&#13;
payments in lieu of taxes, but excluding provision for depreciation, other non-cash&#13;
operating charges and interest and other charges on debt.&#13;
(f)    Net non-operating income is the difference between: revenues from all sources other&#13;
than those related to operation; and expenses; including taxes and payments in lieu of&#13;
taxes, incurred in the generation of revenues from all sources other than those related&#13;
to operations.&#13;
(g)    Total operating expenses include all expenses related to operations, including&#13;
administration, adequate maintenance, taxes and payments in lieu of taxes, and&#13;
provision for depreciation, but excluding interest and charges on debt;&#13;
(h)    Working capital other than cash means the difference between all current assets&#13;
excluding cash and current liabilities.&#13;
(i)    Current assets excluding cash means all assets other than cash which could in the&#13;
ordinary course of business be converted into cash within twelve months, including&#13;
accounts receivable, marketable securities, inventories and prepaid expenses properly&#13;
chargeable to operating expenses within the next fiscal year.&#13;
(j)    Current liabilities means all liabilities which will become due and payable or could&#13;
under circumstances than existing be called for payment within twelve months,&#13;
including accounts payable, customer advances, debt-service requirements, taxes and&#13;
payments in lieu of taxes and dividends.&#13;
(k)    Debt service requirements is the aggregate amount of repayments (including sinking-&#13;
fund payments if any) of, and other charges on, long-term debt.&#13;
(I)    Long-term debt is the indebtedness of RENEL, with the foreign portion appropriately&#13;
revalued, which has a maturity of more than one year.&#13;

ROMANIA&#13;
POWER SECTOR REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
ANALYSIS OF PROJECTJUSTIFICATION&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The analysis of economic justification is carried out in two stages. The first stage establishes&#13;
that the proposed Project is the least-cost means of meeting the demand for electricity and thermal&#13;
energy, and of restoring dependable base-load capacity in the power supply system, compared to&#13;
other alternatives feasible options considered, including electricity imports. The second stage&#13;
establishes that the investment in rehabilitation of the selected thermal units is economically profitable,&#13;
in that the rate of return is in excess of the long-term opportunity cost of capital to Romania.&#13;
2.     Analysis of future demand for electricity and thermal energy is based on the assumption that&#13;
in view of the economic transformation that is still going on, which will reduce the energy intensity of&#13;
the economy, demand will remain depressed below the 1990 levels until about year 2005. The&#13;
projected demand has been used to evaluate the economic merits of the Project in terms of need and&#13;
its timing.&#13;
Least- Cost Analysis&#13;
3.     The results of the preliminary Least-cost Power Generation Expansion study carried out by&#13;
consultants for RENEL assigned priority to the rehabilitation of existing power generating facilities.&#13;
To complement this finding, and to properly establish the merits of rehabilitation among the&#13;
alternatives considered in the least cost analysis, the detailed technical inspection and feasibility study&#13;
of thermal units/plants rehabilitation (discussed in Chapter III) was undertaken by consultants for&#13;
RENEL. The study was focused on thermal plants because of their critical importance in providing&#13;
based-load capacity, and the rapid deterioration in their operational performance.&#13;
4.     The study concluded that the thermal plants are in a more degraded and unsafe operating&#13;
condition than assumed in the least-cost study, and as such unless urgent rehabilitation is undertaken,&#13;
a number of them would cease to be operational within the next five years, and the generating system&#13;
would begin to experience serious deficiencies in base-load capacity as early as 1995. The future&#13;
electricity demand profile indicates that for the foreseeable future, the system's priority need will&#13;
continue to be base load capacity, as opposed to peaking capacity, because of the continuing relatively&#13;
high proportion of industrial demand.&#13;
5.     The methodological approach of the feasibility study called for detailed inspection,including&#13;
non-destructive testing (NDT) of materials, assessment of creep damage, remnant life analyses of&#13;
parts of unit components and auxiliary plant items. This was to determine the level of economic&#13;
rehabilitation necessary to achieve life extension levels compatible with the current status of the&#13;
plants/units. The inspections enabled the determination of costs and benefits associated with three&#13;
levels of rehabilitation as follows:&#13;
*      level 1 - rehabilitation for 7 years life extension (50,000 hours of operating duty);&#13;
*      level 2 - rehabilitation for 15 years life extension&#13;
(100,000 hours of operating duty); and&#13;
&#13;

*      level 3 - rehabilitation for 25 years life extension&#13;
(150,000 hours of operating duty).&#13;
6.     The feasibility study was conducted on eleven representative thermal units selected on the&#13;
basis of type of technology, unit size, fuel type, age, and operating history. The criteria and selection&#13;
was based on an initial field survey carried out by the Bank and consultants. The representative unit&#13;
candidates were:&#13;

7.    In determining the appropriate level of rehabilitation for each representative unit candidate, a&#13;
lifetime cost analysis was first undertaken. The lifetime cost analysis was considered appropriate&#13;
since the preliminary least-cost analysis had already enabled comparison between the plants/units.&#13;
The analysis follows a conventional approach, based on comparison of alternatives over a reasonably&#13;
long period, to bring the alternatives to a common basis in terms of power and energy capability for&#13;
comparison. The alternatives considered comprised: (a) no rehabilitation or replacement with an&#13;
alternative new plant; (b) rehabilitation to level 1; (c) rehabilitation to level 2; (d) rehabilitation to&#13;
level 3, using the associated incremental capital, operating and maintenance costs.&#13;
8.     The evaluation considered:&#13;
*      a lifetime of 25 years. If the unit' without or with rehabilitation, is expected to have&#13;
a shorter life, then a notional replacement plant is allowed for in the cost stream;&#13;
*      capital costs include the cost of notional replacement plant at the expiry of the life of&#13;
the existing plant. Any such new plant is assumed to have the same net output as the&#13;
plant it replaces, and is costed accordingly;&#13;
*      a capital credit is allowed in respect of the unexpired life of any plant at the end of&#13;
the 25 year life;&#13;
*      in some cases, rehabilitation is expected to lead to an increase in the sent out&#13;
capability of the unit, i.e a recovery of lost output. Some credit is due on this&#13;
account. This credit is calculated as a debit to the un-rehabilitated unit: a notional&#13;
capital cost is debited to the relevant lifetime costs, the cost being proportional to the&#13;
shortfall;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 3 of 14&#13;
*      if the un-rehabilitated unit is incapable of matching the energy output of the&#13;
rehabilitated unit (because it is de-rated) then the energy shortfall is calculated at the&#13;
energy cost of the unrehabilitated unit. The reasoning behind this approach is that, in&#13;
a well run system, there should be no other unloaded unit of lower operating cost.&#13;
Therefore, the shortfall must be made up by a unit of equal higher operating cost;&#13;
*      fuel costs are calculated on an annual capacity factor of 60 percent, i.e on the basis&#13;
that the plant will be operating as base load plant;&#13;
*      the cost of operation and maintenance is calculated according to normal planning&#13;
procedures, taking into account the type of plant and the fuel; and&#13;
*      the total costs are present valued to a common date employing a range of discount&#13;
rates and the lifetime cost of energy is deduced.&#13;
9.     Capital Costs: The capital cost estimates comprise expenditure on dismantling and removal&#13;
of equipment to be replaced, provision of equipment, materials, engineering services and on-site&#13;
supervision and installation of replacement equipment. The estimates of cost of replacement&#13;
equipment take into account that some manufacturing of equipment will be done in Romania, but&#13;
allow for imports of necessary foreign inputs, application of Western standards of design, quality&#13;
control of materials and workmanship for the construction as well. The cost estimates include&#13;
physical contingency of about 15% compared to 5-10% for new plants. For rehabilitation to levels 2&#13;
and 3 life extension, the costs include installation of low NoX burners, and for the lignite/coal fired&#13;
units complete rehabilitation of electrostatic precipitators. No allowance is made for installation of&#13;
flue gas desulphurization (FGD) equipment.&#13;
11.    Annual Fixed Operation and Maintenance Cost: This is calculated as percent of total capital&#13;
cost of a new plant alternative of the relevant fuel type and capacity. The estimates used are: for gas&#13;
fired unit (1.9%), and about 2% for oil and lignite/coal.&#13;
12.     Fuel Costs: Local lignite and coal costs to RENEL comprise the marginal cost, ex-mine&#13;
plus rail transport cost to the plant. Imported hard coal is priced at CIF Constanza plus local&#13;
transport cost. Fuel oil is priced at import parity plus local transport cost. To minimize the corrosive&#13;
effects, and reduce operating costs, the oil fired units would switch to fuel oil of 1 % sulphur content.&#13;
Natural gas is priced at import parity plus local transmission costs. Table 1 summarizes fuel prices&#13;
and fuel data.&#13;

12.    Unit Efficiency: Due to lack of metering, reported unit efficiency had been treated with&#13;
caution. Consultants estimates of efficiency to be expected after rehabilitation are in accordance with&#13;
values to be expected from plant in good condition, properly operated, having regard to the type of&#13;
plant and expected mode of operation as a base load plant. The efficiency rates are based on annual&#13;
averages. For the co-generation units, the higher efficiency is allowed for by transferring the benefit&#13;
as heat producers to their role as electricity producers.&#13;
13.   Availability: As with efficiency, consultants estimates of the future availability of the units&#13;
without rehabilitation are based on statistical evidence. For post-rehabilitation, is based on intended&#13;
degree of reliability, with adjustment for regular scheduled maintenance and forced outages of about 8&#13;
weeks and 2 weeks respectively leaving 41 week (7,000 hours) availability, 80%, per year.&#13;
14.   Remaining life: The list of items to be replaced, repaired and overhauled commensurate with&#13;
each level of rehabilitation was identified for each unit candidate. For the oil and gas fired units&#13;
rehabilitation to level 3, is possible because most major components of the unit have been previously&#13;
replaced.&#13;
15.   Annual capacity factor: This is based on the assumption that the units will be operated as&#13;
base-load units at an annual capacity factor of 80% - equivalent to annual operation over 7000 hours&#13;
at an average output of 75% of rated capacity.&#13;
16.   Benefits: The potential quantifiable benefits of rehabilitation are:&#13;
*     increased availability;&#13;
*      increased efficiency;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 5 of 14&#13;
*      longer life; and&#13;
*      increased power output.&#13;
These are estimated for each level of rehabilitation.&#13;
17.    Utilizing the above information, the following alternatives were evaluated on the basis of life&#13;
cycle costs to determine whether to proceed with rehabilitation or not:&#13;
*      no rehabilitation;&#13;
*      rehabilitation to level 1;&#13;
*      rehabilitation to level 2; and&#13;
*      rehabilitation to level 3.&#13;
The results are:&#13;
*      rehabilitation is the preferred option compared to new plant alternative;&#13;
*      co-generation units yield lower costs than electricity only units;&#13;
*       for oil and gas fired units, level 3 yields the lowest life cycle costs; and&#13;
*      the difference in capital costs between levels 2 and 3 is relatively small except&#13;
for lignite and coal-fired units for which the greater life extension of level 3&#13;
implies the need to install flue-gas desulphurization units. Capital costs of&#13;
level I rehabilitation is markedly less than level 2 or 3, but economic benefits&#13;
are more than proportionally lower.&#13;
18.    The general conclusion from the above is that a significant number of thermal units could be&#13;
candidates for rehabilitation. To arrive at the optimum number of candidates, the following factors&#13;
were considered:&#13;
(a)    pollution impact, necessitating that coal fired units be limited to level 2 rehabilitation;&#13;
(b)    risk of under-performance of units with design problems. Units with history of&#13;
reliable performance were given priority in the selection; and&#13;
(c)    social issues such as the need to service district heating systems, and the care of the&#13;
environment. Gas fired cogeneration units were accorded highest priority.&#13;
19.    The results showed that the gas-fired units are the highest in ranking, followed by oil-fired&#13;
cogeneration units, and the condensing solid fuel-fired units as lowest in ranking. These are shown in&#13;
Table 2.&#13;

20.   The above program will reinstate about 2,320 MW of firm dependable base load capacity that&#13;
would otherwise be lost without rehabilitation. To establish that the proposed rehabilitation program&#13;
is the least- cost solution, it was compared to other options of providing base load capacity. The&#13;
comparison shows that the rehabilitation of the thermal units is economically more favorable than&#13;
alternatives which include: (a) completion of Units 2 and 3 of the Cernavoda nuclear power plant and&#13;
of unfinished hydropower plants, with storage reservoirs, on firm energy capability basis; and (b) gas&#13;
fired combined-cycle alternative. The time constraint in making capacity available is an added&#13;
advantage of rehabilitation over new units. The possibility of imports of electricity from Ukraine was&#13;
examined, but was disregarded because it would be more expensive than the production from the&#13;
rehabilitated units, and in addition, it could not be relied upon as a source of firm continuous supply&#13;
to meet base-load requirements. However, during critical periods of demand, when some of the large&#13;
units would be under rehabilitation, imports may be needed to supplement local supply. Table 3&#13;
provides the comparison.&#13;

21.   There are uncertainties concerning the additional cost to completion of the Cernavoda nuclear&#13;
power units, which should be established by a detailed engineering assessment. In addition, the costs&#13;
do not include de-commissioning and spent fuel disposal costs. It is highly improbable that imported&#13;
nuclear fuel will be used in Cernavoda since the local mining and fuel processing infrastructure has&#13;
not been established.&#13;

be barely able to meet the demand. Table 4 compares available dependable continuous power output&#13;

Lignite to Imported Hard Coal Conversion&#13;
23.    The technical inspection and feasibility study conducted on the lasi cogeneration lignite fired&#13;
unit was to establish the technical and economic merits of conversion of 11 similar units (1 lx50 MW&#13;
cogeneration) to use of imported hard coal as the primary fuel. The results confirmed the technical&#13;
and economic justification for such conversion. An additional important benefit is the reduction in air&#13;
pollution and lower volume of ash disposal that the conversion would bring about.&#13;
24.   The economic merit is the curtailment of the uneconomic transportation of lignite over long&#13;
distances (300-600 km). At the lasi power station the economic cost of lignite delivered is about&#13;
US$25/ton compared to the delivered cost of imported hard coal through Constanza port of about&#13;
US$50/ton. To establish the economic merit of the conversion, the present value of economic cost of&#13;
lignite at the power station over the life of the unit was compared with the present value of the&#13;
incremental capital and fuel cost for the conversion over the same life of the unit. The former was&#13;
estimated at US$140 million compared with US$60 million for the latter. In addition, operation and&#13;
maintenance costs will be lower in the case of the conversion.&#13;
25.    Similar analysis has been extended to the other 10 units at the different locations in the North&#13;
Eastern part of the country. The conversion of the units, apart from the environmental benefits,&#13;
provides a least-cost means of serving the same quantity of heat and electricity demand.&#13;

Rate of Return Analysis&#13;
26.   The rate of return on the investments in the rehabilitation component is estimated to be about&#13;
21 %. Computations are provided in Table 6. The analysis follows the traditional approach of&#13;
comparing quantifiable incremental costs and benefits to the power system of the rehabilitation&#13;
program. The estimates of investment costs and of fixed operation and maintenance costs are based&#13;
on the estimates of the consultants that conducted the feasibility study. Fuel costs are estimated at&#13;
improved unit efficiencies resulting from rehabilitation, and fuel prices reflect border prices.&#13;
Allowance is made for outage cost, which represents the incremental cost to the power system of units&#13;
being taken out of service for rehabilitation, and their outputs replaced by increasing the output of&#13;
less efficient thermal power units in the system. The estimate of the outage cost is based on the&#13;
additional fuel and other variable operating costs of the less efficient units. The outage costs are&#13;
estimated as follows:&#13;
1997          =     US$7million&#13;
1998          =     US$40million&#13;
1999          =     US$45million&#13;
2000          =      US$10million&#13;
All costs are expressed in economic terms and in prices of January 1994.&#13;
26.   The quantifiable benefits comprise: (a) fuel savings from improved unit efficiency; (b)&#13;
increase in electricity production resulting from increase in power output, and improved availability;&#13;
(c) savings in consumption of support fuel- natural gas and fuel oil- in the lignite and coal fired units&#13;
through improved loading of units, and reduction in stops and starts of the units; (d) improvement in&#13;
quantity and reliability of heat supply, which is captured through credit of the efficiency of&#13;
cogeneration to electricity production.&#13;
27.   Incremental electricity sales is valued at the average electricity price of US cents 5/kWh, the&#13;
agreed average price under the SAL, which the Government is committed to maintain in real terms&#13;
through periodic adjustments for exchange rate changes, as a proxy for the benefits of electricity&#13;
consumption.&#13;
Other Benefits&#13;
28.   For the conversion, incremental costs consist of the capital cost of the conversion and the&#13;
associated fixed operation and maintenance costs. The benefit is the savings in cost of fuel delivered,&#13;
and operation and maintenance costs. An added benefit (not quantified) is the reduction in pollution&#13;
that the conversion will bring about.&#13;
29.   Other benefits, which are not readily quantifiable, are associated with the improvements in the&#13;
quality of the environment discussed earlier, mainly the reduction in air pollution that the&#13;
rehabilitation will bring about. Additional benefits will arise from improvements in management and&#13;
associated operational cost reductions arising from the corporate restructuring program.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
30.   Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the robustness of the economics of the project. A&#13;
20% increase in capital costs could arise in rehabilitation work of this nature due to greater than&#13;
expected plant deterioration that might be uncovered during implementation. Other considerations are&#13;
that the rehabilitation might not achieve the expected improvements in fuel use efficiency and&#13;
availability, thus leading to higher fuel consumption, and that the targeted level of reliability may not&#13;
be achieved. Reduction of 10% in fuel use efficiency and expected availability improvements are&#13;
&#13;

assumed. The robustness of the project economics was examined under the extreme condition of all&#13;
those effects occurring simultaneously, which is considered to be highly unlikely. Even under such&#13;
highly unlikely conditions, the rate of return would still be about 10%, and this figure does not&#13;
include benefits that cannot quantified, including consumer surplus and environmental benefits.&#13;
Hence the economic justification of the project is considered to be robust.&#13;
32.    The results of the analysis shown in Table 5 indicates the robustness of the economic rate of&#13;
return in the face of increased capital costs and reductions in fuel use efficiency and electricity&#13;
Production, as well as at the lower electricity price. Detailed calculations are presented in Tables 6-&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Power Sector
            Rehabilitation and Modernization Project are to: 1) support
            the government's program to reform the power sector in
            accordance with its overall economic reform objectives; 2)
            meet the demand for electricity and thermal energy in an
            economic manner by rehabilitating thermal generation
            capacity; and 3) lay the foundation for the future
            development of the sector in an institutionally,
            economically, and environmentally sustainable manner. The
            project includes the following components: 1) a power sector
            reform program under which technical assistance will be
            provided to the government of Romania through the Ministry
            of Industries; 2) a thermal plant rehabilitation program
            which includes equipment, services and technical assistance
            to be provided to the Romanian Electricity Authority (RENEL)
            to: a) rehabilitate part of its existing thermal generation
            capacity; b) convert part of its existing lignite-based
            thermal capacity to coal use; and c) reduce the pollution
            impact of thermal plants; and 3) a corporate restructuring
            program which will provide technical assistance to RENEL.
