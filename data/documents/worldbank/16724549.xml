&amp;#12;                                            Summary&#13;
What is needed to improve sanitation markets in rural East Java, Indonesia? To answer the question, a&#13;
team of experts conducted a qualitative diagnostic assessment of sanitation-related opportunities and&#13;
constraints in rural East Java between January and August 2007. The team conducted two field visits to&#13;
the districts of Lumajang, Madura, Megaluh, Probolingo, and Jombang and the city of Surabaya. In&#13;
selected districts, the team conducted in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and a desk review of&#13;
published data to identify factors influencing three key areasâ&#128;&#148;demand, supply, and a market-enabling&#13;
environment. The bottom line: Although the team found little evidence of supply-side constraints,&#13;
catalyzing supply is an opportunity to improve sanitation. However, the biggest challenge lies in&#13;
increasing demand. Factors inhibiting improved sanitation include social acceptance of open defecation,&#13;
unawareness of the health benefits of using hygienic latrines, and incorrect information on costs of&#13;
installing and maintaining hygienic latrines.&#13;
&#13;
The assessment was conducted as part of the Global Sanitation Scaling Up Sanitation Project to test&#13;
proven and promising approaches to create demand for sanitation and to use marketing techniques to&#13;
improve the supply of sanitation-related supply and services for low-income, rural communities. These&#13;
approaches are called Total Sanitation and Sanitation Marketing (TSSM).&#13;
&#13;
Methodology&#13;
To assess the latrine marketâ&#128;&#153;s potential for growth in rural East Java, a team of consultants developed a&#13;
diagnostic tool to guide their assessment and based their indicators on factors influencing demand,&#13;
supply, and an enabling environment, as illustrated in the framework below. (The complete framework&#13;
appears as Figure 2 in section 3 on Market Constraints .)&#13;

&#13;
The analysis differs from previous assessments in Indonesia because it relies on both qualitative data from&#13;
a diverse group of stakeholders and quantitative data from previous socioeconomic surveys. In total,&#13;
seven focus groups and 50 key informant interviews were conducted in six districts and included&#13;
discussions with local residents, provincial and district health staff, community leaders, suppliers and&#13;
manufacturers, and installers of latrine equipment (see Table 1).&#13;

&amp;#12;To assess the growth potential in the latrine market, the team looked at each indicator that influenced the&#13;
viability of the market and assessed if either demand could be stimulated or if constraints affecting&#13;
demand, supply, or an enabling market environment could be removed. As part of the teamâ&#128;&#153;s assessment,&#13;
qualitative data were sought to give program managers and sanitarians a contextual understanding of why&#13;
unhygienic sanitation behaviors have persisted and why latrine markets have failed in some cases. To&#13;
address some of the underlying personal, social, and environmental reasons for lack of growth in latrine&#13;
markets, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews elicited perceptions, opinions on barriers to&#13;
latrine market growth, and recommendations on how to stimulate demand for hygienic latrines.&#13;
&#13;
The consultants complemented the qualitative information with data from three different surveys: 1) the&#13;
Survei Sosial Ekonomi Nasional (SUSENAS) , the national socioeconomic survey, conducted in 2004; 2)&#13;
an environmental survey commissioned by the Environmental Services Program of the U.S. Agency for&#13;
International Development (ESP-USAID), conducted in 2006; and 3) the Demographic and Health&#13;
Surveys (DHS) for Indonesia, conducted in 2003. Survey data give information on defecation practices,&#13;
sources and use of drinking water, household characteristics, expenditure patterns, and media habits.&#13;
However, limitations to the survey data include: 1) the surveys were not conducted at the same point in&#13;
time as the qualitative data; 2) survey data are representative of East Java, but have not been&#13;
disaggregated for each district; and 3) in 2004, sanitation-related indicators from SUSENAS were not&#13;
harmonized with indicators later proposed by the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) of the World&#13;
Health Organization and UNICEF. Despite limitations in the survey data available, these quantitative data&#13;
give some scope to the situation in Indonesia, suggest sanitation targets, and highlight areas that pose&#13;
challenges.&#13;
&#13;
Highlights of the Assessment&#13;
The assessment uncovered the following:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Inadequate sanitation practices not only are&#13;
        widespread but also are socially accepted in         KEY FINDINGS (A level head)&#13;
        East Java. More than one-third of rural families&#13;
        practice river defecation. None of the families      â&#128;¢   More than one-third of families in rural East Java&#13;
                                                                 practice river defecation, and few wash their hands&#13;
        interviewed expressed dissatisfaction with river&#13;
                                                                 with soap after defecation.&#13;
        defecation and tolerate their neighbors and&#13;
        others defecating in rivers.                         â&#128;¢   Neither inability to pay for hygienic latrines nor lack&#13;
                                                                 of space predicted open defecation. Investing in&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Defecating near running water is an important            hygienic latrines was a low priority for those families&#13;
        criterion for all. The benefits of defecating near       who prefer to spend their disposable income on other&#13;
        running water outweigh any benefits of a                 commodities.&#13;
        private latrine if water for anal cleansing is not&#13;
        available.                                           â&#128;¢   Social marketing of hygienic latrines is needed to&#13;
                                                                 change social acceptance toward open defecation and&#13;

&amp;#12;   â&#128;¢   Increased social prestige motivates households to install latrines. People commonly identified&#13;
       social prestige and reputation, privacy, convenience, and maintaining modesty as key benefits of&#13;
       installing a latrine. Few people stated health benefits.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Most respondents overestimate the costs of installing improved sanitation facilities. Many&#13;
       overestimated the costs of installing improved sanitation facilities by six to eight times the actual&#13;
       costs. In addition, many do not realize that improved sanitation could be as simple as a hygienic&#13;
       pit latrine and does not need to be an elaborate flush toilet.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Enhancing services for latrine installations presents a big opportunity. Although there was little&#13;
       evidence of supply-side shortages in products or services, enhancing latrine installations and&#13;
       improving maintenance would enhance the latrine market and improve customer satisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Local health departments should invest in social marketing for improved sanitation. Awareness of&#13;
       diseases from unsanitary defecation practices is extremely limited. Local health departments can&#13;
       provide invaluable help in stimulating demand for hygienic latrines and hand-washing.&#13;

This document summarizes preliminary                providers will participate in both CLTS&#13;
findings from two country missions                  triggering and sanitation promotion&#13;
conducted in Indonesia between January and          activities.&#13;
August 2007. These missions were the first&#13;
of a series of steps to develop a                   Fourth, the findings have contributed to&#13;
comprehensive sanitation marketing strategy         design of promotion and communication&#13;

In the context of the projectâ&#128;&#153;s sequenced           communication requirements in the creative&#13;
approach, the findings from these missions          brief. In particular, the preliminary findings&#13;
have primarily served the purpose of                have served to develop contractual&#13;
advancing strategies to stimulate demand            arrangements with advertising agencies and&#13;

                                                    helped WSP and its partners to validate the&#13;
Second, the findings have contributed to the        market potential for improved sanitation,&#13;
formulation of research questions and design        including an estimate of the existing&#13;
of questionnaires for quantitative consumer         capacity of local artisans, small businesses,&#13;
and household surveys. The quantitative             and supply chains, as well as the availability&#13;
appraisals will contribute to the task of           of sanitation and hygiene products and&#13;
identifying demand constraints and of               services. Finally, the mission helped the&#13;
designing behavioral strategies.                    WSP country team to develop a detailed cost&#13;

Demographic Health Survey, conducted in&#13;
2003.&#13;
Data from the socioeconomic survey&#13;
generally describe the sanitation problem.&#13;
Quantitative data describe defecation&#13;
behavior, sources and use of drinking water,&#13;
household living conditions, family&#13;
expenditures, and education levels in the&#13;
project areas. The quantitative data reveal&#13;
the diversity of the sanitation challenge.&#13;
When possible, qualitative information&#13;
provides further insight of customer&#13;
behavior. We are aware, however, of the&#13;
limitations of the quantitative and qualitative&#13;
data contained in this report. First, the set of&#13;
sanitation questions from SUSENAS (2004)&#13;
were been harmonized with those proposed&#13;
by JMP at the time of the survey. WSP has&#13;
adopted JMP standards for this project. The&#13;
focus of SUSENAS in 2004 was marginal to&#13;
the sanitation problem. Second, the&#13;
qualitative data cannot be used to infer&#13;
parameters for the entire population of East&#13;
Java. The qualitative data may not be valid&#13;
outside of the interviewed sample in the&#13;
selected districts. Finally, this report&#13;
presents a deductive approach to describe&#13;
some of the root problems constraining the&#13;
latrine market. The facts are general to East&#13;
Java and are not specific to any particular&#13;
location. Individual districts in East Java&#13;
present a different situation to the general&#13;
one described in this document. A process of&#13;
critical inquiry is important to identify those&#13;
factors that constrain installation and&#13;
consistent use of latrines in each location.&#13;
This report aims to provide project managers&#13;
with insight on sanitation markets and&#13;
practical information to guide contracting&#13;

&amp;#12;3. Market Constraints&#13;
Demand for latrines is based on the                               necessary but not sufficient condition. Rural&#13;
aggregated decisions of families to install                       sanitation markets do not always function as&#13;
toilets. Sanitation supply includes                               anticipated. Installers often do not&#13;
availability of construction materials and                        internalize adequate returns from&#13;
services for installation. To assess enabling                     investments in promotion and are unable to&#13;
opportunities, we consider local rules                            bear the risks of developing the market.&#13;
regarding sanitation, financing, availability&#13;
of community support, and government&#13;
commitment to sanitation. 1 These&#13;
dimensions are used in this report because of&#13;
their close relationship with market&#13;
outcomes. However, WSP has developed a&#13;
more comprehensive framework to assess an&#13;
enabling environment that focuses on a&#13;
broader set of dimensions that are necessary&#13;
for programmatic scaling-up of the&#13;
initiative. (For further information, see&#13;
Robinson 2007.)&#13;
Determinants of functioning markets are&#13;
mutually enhancing (Figure 2). If any of&#13;
these dimensions fails, the total result will&#13;
be zero, regardless of investments in any of&#13;
the other two dimensions. When the market&#13;
is weak, district health officials (as a&#13;
catalyst) should remove constraints in any of&#13;
these three dimensions.&#13;
Experience from Vietnam and Bangladesh&#13;
suggests that demand is the most important&#13;
determinant. If markets function properly,&#13;
supply will emerge. However, demand is a&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
  The enabling environment consists of nine dimensions&#13;
that are considered essential to the scaling up,&#13;
sustainability, and replication of total sanitation and&#13;
sanitation marketing approaches in rural areas: Policy,&#13;
strategy, and direction; Partnerships; Institutional&#13;
arrangements; Program methodology; Implementation&#13;
capacity; Availability of products and services; Financing&#13;
and incentives; Cost effective implementation; and&#13;
Monitoring and evaluation. The document â&#128;&#156;Enabling&#13;
Environment Assessment, Assessment area: East Java,&#13;
Indonesiaâ&#128;? (Robinson 2007) provides a detailed assessment&#13;
of each of these dimensions.&#13;
                                                             11&#13;

&amp;#12;Figure 2: Indicators Influencing Growth&#13;
of Latrine Markets in Indonesia&#13;
There is a big payoff in reducing constraints.&#13;
Diagnostic analysis should be used to&#13;
identify market strategies that are responsive&#13;
and specific to local constraints. Market&#13;
failures fall in four categories: a weak&#13;
sanitation supply, a weak sanitation demand,&#13;
a poor enabling environment, or a&#13;
combination of these.&#13;
Figure 2 integrates planning with monitoring&#13;
of promotion activities. For the market to&#13;
work effectively, each constraint must be&#13;
removed. The following sections briefly&#13;
explore each of these in detail: demand,&#13;
supply, and enabling environment.&#13;

&amp;#12;4. Sanitation Demand&#13;
Demand is a key determinant of a&#13;
functioning sanitation market. Among the&#13;
reasons given for a lack of demand,&#13;
however, many do not seem to be supported&#13;
by the available quantitative data.&#13;
&#13;
Disposable Income&#13;
Provincial health officials and sanitarians&#13;
have argued that low incomes result in&#13;
widespread river defecation. These health&#13;
officers rank work impairment and&#13;
unemployment as the principal reasons for&#13;
low incomes. Villagers mentioned lack of&#13;
disposable income as the main factor&#13;
preventing installation of a septic tank (ESP-&#13;
USAID 2006).&#13;
If this argument were correct, the heads of           Source: Susenas 2004&#13;

community would defecate in improved&#13;

                                                      include poor awareness of the potential&#13;
 However, the data reveal a different                 benefits of latrines; low awareness of latrine&#13;
situation (Figure 3). While low incomes are           designs, models, and other sanitary options;&#13;

                                                       but in the long run, communities and the&#13;
Private Sector                                         local governments will take over.&#13;
The private sector has clear strengths in&#13;
installation, retail, and distribution of&#13;
sanitary materials; manufacturing of cement&#13;
rings and spare sanitary parts; and servicing&#13;
and operating latrines. Local installers have&#13;
the ability to quickly respond to rapid&#13;
demand increases. Masons have long-term&#13;
capacity to participate in the market, given&#13;
sufficient financial returns. However, rural&#13;
installers have limited motivation and&#13;
tolerance for risk. They have shown limited&#13;
ability to innovate, adapt supply to the needs&#13;
of customers, and promote their skills. In&#13;
addition, installers operate at a modest scale,&#13;
often with limited financial capacity.&#13;
Installation of latrines yields modest revenue&#13;
and margins for them. Latrine installers&#13;
operate in a fragmented way. In economic&#13;
terms, this fragmentation implies that a               Local Governments&#13;
subdivided pool of players experience&#13;

                   films, soap operas, quizzes and talk shows.&#13;
                 â&#128;¢ Most East Javanese favor shows featuring artists from Jakarta.&#13;
Radio            â&#128;¢ A popular practice entails dedicating songs to family and friends through local radio&#13;
                   programs. Villagers purchase greetings broadcasts through vouchers. A voucher costs&#13;
                   about IDR 1,000 and is valid for 4 songs.&#13;

                   village gatherings effectively. Thus, these are ideal for awareness building, especially&#13;
                   for community gatherings and local events.&#13;

performances       revealed local orchestras â&#128;&#152;dangdutâ&#128;&#153; catch peopleâ&#128;&#153;s attention effectively but folk&#13;
                   performances fail to engage villagers. Other villagers, in contrast, stated folk&#13;
                   performances entertain villagers successfully.&#13;
                 â&#128;¢ Local performances mixed with competitions that feature local villagers are useful to&#13;
                   encourage participation.&#13;

                   â&#128;¢ Demonstrations in local languages would reach wider audiences.&#13;
                   â&#128;¢ Villagers stated interest in watching videos of hygiene and sanitation (Visuals can&#13;
                     effectively convey messages through animations, including complex concepts such as&#13;

                                                     existence of a water reservoir, a tap with&#13;

Another concern relates to the willingness of&#13;
retailers to sell innovative options at their&#13;
stores. A stock of an unknown squatting pan&#13;
product represents a risky investment&#13;
because of slow turnover and costs of unsold&#13;
product inventories. During the field visit,&#13;

Forward&#13;
Inadequate sanitation practices are                    Enhancing latrine installations and&#13;
widespread in rural East Java. More than               improving maintenance services represents&#13;
one-third of rural families practiced river            an opportunity. However, we found little&#13;
defecation in 2004 (SUSENAS 2004).                     evidence of supply shortages. Most villagers&#13;
Interviews and focus group discussions                 recognized the value of specialized skills for&#13;
show that washing of hands and anal                    sanitation masonry, particularly for&#13;
cleansing with soap are rare. The use of               installing flush toilets. Services to improve&#13;
latrines appeal to most river defecators,              installation standards should be&#13;
although none of them is dissatisfied with             economically viable when delivered from&#13;
river defecation. For these individuals, the           experts to masons and from masons to&#13;
benefits of defecating in rivers outweigh              customers. Viable improvements will factor&#13;
using a latrine due to availability of water,          as price markups in installation costs.&#13;
proximity of water source, and social                  Vendors supplying integrated solutions such&#13;

Competing preferences and social                       from increased spending in sanitation and&#13;
acceptance of open defecation limit                    improved efficiency of sanitation&#13;
installations of improved latrines, rather than        expenditures. Eliminating hardware&#13;
inability to pay for installations or space            subsidies would represent the first step in&#13;
limitations. Latrine installation ranked               the right direction. Sanitation strategies&#13;
among the last items in a family list of               should reinforce the social benefits from&#13;
priorities. The causes of competing                    consistent use of latrines; eliminate social&#13;
preferences are varied. First, river defecation        acceptance of river defecation; dispel wrong&#13;

villagers tolerate the practice of open                market information prices and models of&#13;
defecation. Second, villagers do not know              toilets; and bring convenience, information,&#13;
the dangers of human exposure to feces and             and service to the customer.&#13;
the benefits of cleansing with soap. Finally,&#13;
villagers overestimate the costs of improved           Defecating practices, however, vary&#13;
latrines, underestimate the benefits of                substantially among districts. The rate of&#13;
improved pits, and overrate the benefits of            households with no latrines ranged between&#13;
septic tanks. Villagers rated social benefits          5.6 percent and 76.4 percent in the 29&#13;
over health benefits for installing improved           districts in 2004 (SUSENAS 2004).&#13;
latrines, with privacy, convenience,                   Communities present varied constraints and&#13;

            Opportunities to improve sanitation :
            situation assessment of sanitation in rural East Java, Indonesia

            The primary goal of the project is to
            learn about scaling-up and about effective and efficient
            interventions that improve health. It is a large-scale
            effort to meet the basic sanitation needs of the rural poor
            who do not currently have access to safe and hygienic
            sanitation. This aim will be accomplished by developing
            practical knowledge for designing sanitation and hygiene
            programs that are effective at improving health and are
            sustainable at large scale for rural areas. The project has
            three related objectives: 1) to generate demand for improved
            sanitation services, 2) to strengthen supply for improved
            sanitation services, and 3) to enhance the enabling
            environment so that improvements in sanitation coverage can
            be scaled up and sustained. In the context of the
            project's sequenced approach, the findings from these
            missions have primarily served the purpose of advancing
            strategies to stimulate demand and enhance supply of
            sanitation. First, the missions identified valuable insights
            related to sanitation habits and practices of low-income
            families living in rural districts of East Java. Second, the
            findings have contributed to the formulation of research
            questions and design of questionnaires for quantitative
            consumer and household surveys. Third, the findings have
            helped the Indonesia country team of the Water and
            Sanitation Program (WSP) to develop working hypotheses to
            enhance provider and retail strategies.
