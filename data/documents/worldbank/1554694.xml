FOREWORD&#13;
Centrally planned economies (CPEs) account for a significant share of&#13;
the world's production and income.    In view of their importance in the world&#13;
economy, and to facilitate international comparative analysis, for many years&#13;
the World Bank has included statistical data on these countries in those of&#13;
its publications that aim for universal coverage, such as The World Bank&#13;
Atlas. Among these data, those relating to gross national product (GNP) and&#13;
to GNP per capita are the most important, and the Bank also needs them for&#13;
operational purposes for its member countries, which now include some CPEs.&#13;
In the CPEs prices are generally set administratively and are often&#13;
loosely or not at all related to the relative scarcity and costs of production&#13;
of goods and services.    This is particularly true of the exchange rate.    The&#13;
World Bank normally uses exchange rates for converting GNP figures from&#13;
national   currencies  into   dollars   (or  into  any   other  numeraire),   an&#13;
indispensable   step  for   international  comparisons.     The  choice   of  an&#13;
appropriate conversion factor therefore poses particularly difficult problems&#13;
for most CPEs.   A further difficulty arises because the national accounts of&#13;
the CPEs are based on the concept of net material product (NMP), which differs&#13;
from the concept of GNP used in market economies.     To derive the GNP numbers&#13;
of those CPEs that compile only NMP accounts, various adjustments must be&#13;
made.   The data required for making these adjustments are not always fully&#13;
available.   Finally, a separate set of issues arises in relation to year to&#13;
year comparisons within the same CPE.      For these too and the corresponding&#13;
growth rates, official data are not strictly comparable to growth rates of the&#13;
market economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In early 1982 a research project sponsored and financed by the World&#13;
Bank was undertaken to assess alternative methods of computing the per capita&#13;
dollar GNP levels and growth rates of CPEs.       It covered eight countries:&#13;
Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary,&#13;
Poland, Romania and the U.S.S.R.   The purpose of this research project was to&#13;
define the best among known methods that could be applied to CPEs as a group&#13;
and make use of available data.    It was not its aim to establish and define&#13;
new computation methods whose application would have required many more years&#13;
of effort, even if data had been available.&#13;
-    This  research  project  has   produced  eleven  reports,  which  are&#13;
published  simultaneously.     The  main  report  authored  by  the   principal&#13;
researcher for the project, Paul Marer, is published as a book, Dollar GNPs of&#13;
the USSR and Eastern Europe (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985). The eight&#13;
country studies and two background papers are published separately in the&#13;
World Bank Staff Working Paper series.       The main report provides highly&#13;
valuable insights into the problems related to the estimation and comparison&#13;
of the GNPs and GNP growth rates of the CPEs. It also gives the author's best&#13;
estimates of the actual values of these indicators for the majority of CPEs&#13;
covered by the project, that is those for which there was some statistical&#13;
basis for computing estimates or choosing between those already available.&#13;
The main report on the Research Project on CPEs concludes that&#13;
adequate GNP data in national currencies can be derived for most CPEs by&#13;
adjusting official information about net material product in the light of&#13;
statistical and other information known to country experts.         It further&#13;
concludes that the best method generally applicable to CPEs for converting&#13;
such GNP data from local currencies into dollars would use conversion rates&#13;
based upon purchasing power parity (PPP) information.      For comparison with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
corresponding World Bank data on other World Bank members, these conversion&#13;
rates should be adjusted to correct for the expected differences between the&#13;
PPP rates and the actual official exchange rates (the "exchange rate deviation&#13;
index"). The needed adjustments are estimated econometrically from the actual&#13;
differences observed at each level of per capita GNP among the thirty-one&#13;
market economies participating in Phase III (1975) of the International&#13;
Comparison Project (ICP).    For Hungary, Romania, and Poland, PPP information&#13;
is derived from Phase III (1975) of the ICP, while for Czechoslovakia, the&#13;
German Democratic Republic, and the U.S.S.R., it is derived from private&#13;
bilateral comparisons chain-linked to the ICP data.       This method yields a&#13;
range of per capita GNP estimates: for example, $2,700 to $5,700 with a&#13;
midpoint of $4,190, for the U.S.S.R. in 1980.    No PPP estimate was available,&#13;
and no GNP per capita figure in US dollars calculated, for Bulgaria and Cuba.&#13;
The main report also concludes that the official estimates of growth&#13;
rates of the CPEs "tend to yield varying degrees of upward bias."        For all&#13;
countries except Hungary, the experts lean toward preferring alternative&#13;
indices, constructed by outside experts with partial information, although&#13;
these too present problems (especially for countries other than the U.S.S.R.)&#13;
and the experts therefore fell short of endorsing them.       The author of the&#13;
study on Hungary leans toward preferring the official index at this time.&#13;
The country studies and background papers that are being issued in&#13;
the World Bank Staff Working Paper series provide additional details on the&#13;
CPEs studied and their exchange rates.     Some of the country studies include&#13;
the respective authors' estimates of per capita GNP in U.S. dollars.       These&#13;
estimates, however, are the individual authors' experimental computations,&#13;
based on methods that may not be consistently applicable to CPEs generally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
There remain major uncertainties about GNP conversions by means of&#13;
"adjusted PPPs." In addition to numerous remaining theoretical and practical&#13;
problems associated with calculating PPPs within the framework of the&#13;
centrally coordinated ICP, private estimates such as those used in this study&#13;
for three CPEs still appear to be subject to a wide margin of error.&#13;
Furthermore, there is no other way to estimate the exchange rate deviation&#13;
index than to derive it from observation of the countries covered by the ICP&#13;
(almost all of which are market economies).      The applicability of an index&#13;
derived in this fashion to the CPEs, whose economic structures are very&#13;
different, remains subject to reservations.&#13;
The present study used ICP Phase III data relating to the year 1975,&#13;
extrapolated to 1980.    Phase IV ICP data already published shows estimates&#13;
directly relating to 1980 for European countries, including Hungary and&#13;
Poland; Romania,   a participant in early phases of the ICP, has not provided&#13;
the data needed for participation in Phase IV. It is noteworthy that Phase IV&#13;
estimates of Hungary's and Poland's per capita GNP in 1980 are lower than the&#13;
1975 results extrapolated to 1980, used by the Research Report on CPEs. These&#13;
differences are partly due to the greater attention paid in Phase IV to&#13;
quality differences and to other methodological advances.&#13;
During the course of 1983 the Bank, with the help of a distinguished&#13;
panel of experts, 1/ undertook a review of the methodological problems and&#13;
issues related to the estimation of internationally comparable per capita GNP&#13;
figures for all countries. The preliminary results of the research project on&#13;
CPEs constituted an important input into that review, whose findings and&#13;
1/ Abram Bergson, Harvard University, Chairman; Andre Vanoli, Institut&#13;
National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques; and Parmeet Singh,&#13;
Commonwealth Secretariat.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
recommendations were approved by the panel of experts.         In light of the&#13;
review, the Bank has decided that for the time being (that is, at least until&#13;
data availability and other problems related to PPP information are resolved),&#13;
official GNP information converted at official exchange rates should generally&#13;
continue to provide the basis of the per capita GNP estimates published in The&#13;
World Bank Atlas.   Exceptions to this rule are to be made only when official&#13;
GNP data, in national currency, is exceptionally bad or compiled in ways which&#13;
diverge in an exceptionally large measure from the usual methods and&#13;
standards, or when the official exchange rate is exceptionally far removed&#13;
from the rate effectively governing foreign payments transactions. When there&#13;
is a reason to believe that such exceptional circumstances prevail, and&#13;
adequate information exists, appropriate adjustments are to be made.        When&#13;
adequate information does not exist and cannot be obtained, no estimates are&#13;
to be published.   At the time of writing this foreword, it seems likely that&#13;
lack of information will for some time prevent the Bank from making estimates&#13;
of the per capita GNP of most CPEs.     Thus The World Bank Atlas published in&#13;
early 1985 contains an estimate of the values of GNP and GNP per capita for&#13;
only one European CPE, Hungary.&#13;
Following the review endorsed by the panel of experts, the World Bank&#13;
has adopted calculation methods and obtained results which, for a few&#13;
countries, are different from those of the research project of CPEs.         The&#13;
Bank's general methodology must be applicable to all its member countries,&#13;
including most market economies and only a few CPEs; the Bank could demand&#13;
that its member countries provide additional information when needed; and it&#13;
could, and did, decide not to estimate the per capita GNP of countries for&#13;
which a minimal, but still fairly extensive set of information could not be&#13;
obtained.   As noted earlier, however, the research project on CPEs has aimed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
at defining a method consistently applicable to all CPEs and one that could&#13;
make use of available information.   These differences in aims and constraints&#13;
readily explain the differences in results.&#13;
The research project on CPEs, whose major findings are published in&#13;
the main report, has greatly enhanced the understanding of the CPEs' unique&#13;
macroeconomic accounting frameworks and pricing systems.       It has provided&#13;
insight into many substantive issues, in particular the relationship of&#13;
domestic and international prices.   The individual country reports, published&#13;
separately, shed much light on many important country-specific issues.      The&#13;
Bank will continue to build upon the valuable findings of the research project&#13;
on CPEs in its future efforts to understand these important components of the&#13;
global economy.&#13;

ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper develops estimates of Soviet gross national product (GNP)&#13;
in rubles for the 1970s and in dollars for selected years in the 1970s.      The&#13;
paper also considers alternative ways for converting the GNP estimates in&#13;
rubles to U.S. dollars, and suggests the use of purchasing power parity&#13;
ratio. Finally, the paper discusses various measures of output growth in the&#13;
USSR, and concludes that the official indexes for growth of net material&#13;
product exaggerate the rate of growth of aggregate output.&#13;

SUMMARY&#13;
This paper develops estimates of Soviet gross national product (GNP)&#13;
in rubles for the 1970's and in dollars for selected years in the 1970's. The&#13;
approach used in the USSR for computing national income, like that in all&#13;
socialist countries, differs from that used in the West in covering only&#13;
"material   production"  and   omitting   most  services.     Comparisons   with&#13;
independent estimates of Soviet GNP, made outside the USSR, suggest that&#13;
within its narrower coverage the Soviet figure is consistent with Western&#13;
calculations.   It is therefore possible to arrive at a satisfactory estimate&#13;
of Soviet GNP by adding to the official Soviet series for the net material&#13;
product (NMP) an estimate of incomes generated in nonmaterial production and&#13;
depreciation. This is much simpler, and can be done with a much shorter time&#13;
lag, than estimating GNP from primary data. There are a few departures in the&#13;
resulting figures from the concept we are aiming at.    a)  The official Soviet&#13;
data from which we start are in the spirit of GDP, but the expanded figure&#13;
resulting from the additions indicated differs insignificantly from GNP, since&#13;
there are no significant income transactions in the Soviet balance of&#13;
payments.   b)   The Soviet figure contains some nonmaterial production since&#13;
the net material product approach, in figuring net output in material&#13;
production, does not subtract from gross output the outputs sold or provided&#13;
free by the nonmaterial sectors to the material production sectors. c) The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Soviet data include, in national income generated, a large and growing item of&#13;
"special earnings from foreign trade" consisting mostly of the large&#13;
difference between the value of imports at domestic prices and the cost at&#13;
domestic prices of the exports used to pay for them, a disparity arising from&#13;
the divorce of the Soviet domestic price system from world prices.          Some&#13;
commentators consider that this item should not be included in GNP, but this&#13;
paper argues that it is proper to include it and makes no effort to adjust&#13;
Soviet NMP to eliminate it.&#13;
The paper considers alternative ways for converting its estimates of&#13;
Soviet GNP to dollars.     The conceptually clearest basis for the conversion&#13;
seems to be a purchasing power parity conversion ratio based on as&#13;
representative a sample of price relatives for components of GNP as can be&#13;
assembled. Such ratios have been constructed by U.S. researchers, both in the&#13;
Soviet-quantity-weighted form suitable for converting Soviet GNP into dollars&#13;
and in ths US-quantity-weighted form suitable for converting US GNP into&#13;
rubles. The conversion ratio implicit in the geometric mean of these two GNP&#13;
comparisons is conceptually close to the geometric-mean purchasing-power&#13;
parities that have been computed in the ICP project for a number of other&#13;
countries  for  possible  use   by  the World   Bank.    The Western-calculated&#13;
conversion ratio for 1976 constructed as described is close to a conversion&#13;
ratio which the Soviet Central Statistical Administration has published, when&#13;
allowance is made for the difference in coverage.      The paper also considers&#13;
other kinds of parities, such as the official exchange rate and the realized&#13;
domestic/foreign price parities for exports, imports, and trade as a whole.&#13;
The official exchange rate seems to undervalue the ruble greatly, when&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
compared with either purchasing-power parity ratios, or with the parities&#13;
realized in trade. Of the various possibilities, the purchasing-power parity&#13;
ratio seems most likely to be consistent with a reasonable conceptualizaton of&#13;
what we want the dollar income figure to represent, and to be comparable in&#13;
meaning with the dollar income figures calculated by the World Bank of other&#13;
countries.                                         I&#13;
Finally the paper discusses the various measures of output growth&#13;
that might be used, together with an index of changes in the dollar price&#13;
level, to move a figure for per capita GNP in dollars for some benchmark year&#13;
to later years.    Extensive study by Western scholars has demonstrated that&#13;
official Soviet indexes for growth of NMP probably exaggerate the rate of&#13;
growth of aggregate    output.    There are several possible    sources of the&#13;
difference between the official Soviet series for NMP and GNP growth rates&#13;
calculated  by   others;    a)  material   production  has  grown   faster  than&#13;
nonmaterial, though this has apparently ceased to be the case in the 70's;&#13;
b) the Soviet accounts weight the faster growing sectors slightly more heavily&#13;
than the evidence seems to warrant; and Soviet indexes for individual sectors&#13;
(industry in partidcular) are appreciably higher than can be reproduced on the&#13;
basis of the underlying data about growth of individual components of&#13;
output.    On the other hand,    Western estimates of Soviet GNP growth may&#13;
underestimate actual growth somewhat because of two factors: a) omission of&#13;
the rapidly growing special earnings from foreign trade; and b) a possible&#13;
downward bias in the Western-calculated index for the industrial component of&#13;
GNP, which is generated using a base-year fixed sample.       Nevertheless, the&#13;
paper concludes that the best way to update per capita figures from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
benchmark years of 1976 for which the most detailed conversion ratio has&#13;
actually been calculated, is to use the indexes of GNP growth developed by&#13;
investigators outside the USSR.    On the basis of the GNP estimates in rubles&#13;
made in this paper, and following these arguments regarding conversion to&#13;
dollars, the per capita figure for Soviet GNP in current dollars would be&#13;
$3,893 in 1976, and $5,316 in 1980.&#13;

PART I. EXPANDING SOVIET NMP DATA TO GDP AND GNP&#13;
In developing estimates of Soviet output per capita in dollars, the&#13;
first task is to adjust the figures published by the USSR for aggregate&#13;
output, calculated in the NMP concept, to GDP or GNP.     The purpose of Part I&#13;
is to describe an approach for making these adjustments and to use it to&#13;
develop  estimates  of  Soviet   GNP  in rubles.    Since  the method used    is&#13;
relatively simple, this adjustment is made for each year in the 1970-1980&#13;
decade, rather than only for selected benchmark years.&#13;
Methodological Considerations&#13;
The general features of the approach used in socialist countries for&#13;
computing the national income and output is explained in United Nations, Basic&#13;
Principles,  and will not be reexamined here.       But it will be useful to&#13;
describe briefly against that background the major considerations governing&#13;
the adjustments made in this paper.&#13;
1. In relation to the distinction between GNP and GDP, the official&#13;
Soviet accounts are in the spirit of GDP rather than GNP.     That is, they are&#13;
concerned with productive activity taking place on the territory of the USSR&#13;
rather than with income received by the residents of the USSR.          ("On the&#13;
territory of the USSR" is not to be taken quite literally, since income earned&#13;
by such activities as fishing outside the USSR is included.) Since the Soviet&#13;
balance of payments involves little in the way of international factor&#13;
payments, the difference between GNP and GDP is negligible in the case of the&#13;
USSR.   The one item we might want to consider is interest payments on hard&#13;
currency debt, on the grounds that these represent basically a return on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
machinery imported from the west, which constitutes part of the Soviet capital&#13;
stock.   In theory it should be deducted from GDP to get to GNP, but it is&#13;
small enough to ignore, as seen by the following calculations.        Soviet net&#13;
hard currency debt has been estimated at about 2 billion dollars in 1970,&#13;
growing to 9-10 billion dollars later in the decade.       If the interest rate&#13;
averages something like 15 percent, (on the grounds that this is something&#13;
below the LIBOR rate) interest payments would be between 1.4 and 1.5 billion&#13;
dollars. The ruble valuation should be based on the domestic cost of exports&#13;
needed to cover those payments, which would be a little over one ruble per&#13;
dollar (see the discussion below of the Soviet foreign balance). Compared to&#13;
the 589.5 billion rubles estimated below as GDP in 1980,     this is negligible,&#13;
and the estimates developed in the rest of the paper will be referred to as&#13;
GNP, ignoring the small discrepancy.&#13;
2. As between "income produced" and "income utilized", both of which&#13;
are reported by the USSR Central Statistical Admdinistration, income produced&#13;
comes  closer  to what   we  are  trying   to measure.    As  I understand   the&#13;
literature, what is deducted from income produced to arrive at income utilized&#13;
is capital losses and net foreign investment.        The first is not usually&#13;
allowed for in western practice, and since we are interested in output rather&#13;
than in absorption net foreign investment should be included.      Using data on&#13;
the balance of trade in foreign currency reported by Treml and Kostinsky for&#13;
1970-1978, the difference between income produced and utilized can be divided&#13;
into the two components as shown in Table 1 (net foreign investment is the&#13;
balance of trade valued in foreign prices converted to rubles at the ratio of&#13;
exports valued at domestic prices to their value at foreign prices).    Note&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
that most of the variation comes in net foreign investment, though there is&#13;
still more variability in the implied losses than one might expect.&#13;
3. The major difficulty with the aggregate output figure reported by&#13;
the USSR Central Statistical Administration is that it covers material&#13;
production only, and is net of depreciation. The major task of adjusting to&#13;
GNP in the western sense is thus to add an estimate of value added in service&#13;
activities and depreciation.     As will be shown below, western efforts at&#13;
independent estimation of Soviet GNP are tolerably consistent with Soviet NMP&#13;
with respect to comparable coverage, so I believe it is legitimate to accept&#13;
Soviet NMP data as a starting point rather than computing Soviet GNP directly&#13;
from independently constructed income accounts.&#13;
4.   According to the description of socialist practice in United&#13;
Nations, Basic Principles, passenger transport and communications serving&#13;
persons and non-material production are included in the reported figures for&#13;
net national product.    All the evidence available to me, however, suggests&#13;
that this is not the case for the USSR, and in estimating the output of the&#13;
non-material sphere, an estimate of value added in passenger transport and&#13;
communications serving persons and non-material production must be included.&#13;
5.  Foreign trade has become increasingly important for the USSR in&#13;
recent years, and I would like to explain how I believe the "special earnings&#13;
from foreign trade" should be handled in the adjustment.     All the evidence I&#13;
have seems consistent with the following interpretation.     (See especially in&#13;
this connection Holzman, 1974; Treml, 1972; and Becker, 1972).        The Soviet&#13;
series on national income produced includes as one element the earnings of the&#13;
foreign trade sector, which includes in addition to the usual wage and other&#13;
factor incomes generated by the firms operating in this sector two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
unconventional items, i.e. the domestic value of imports less the value of&#13;
exports, both in domestic prices, and exports minus imports, both valued in&#13;
foreign prices, i.e. net foreign investment in the sense of changes in claims&#13;
against the rest of the world. This second item is converted to rubles at (a)&#13;
either the average ratio of exports valued at domestic prices to their value&#13;
at foreign prices (if there are net exports in foreign prices), or (b) the&#13;
average ratio of imports at domestic prices to their value at foreign prices&#13;
(if there are net imports).&#13;
Some would say that the first of these elements is not domestically&#13;
created value, but I consider the Soviet approach reasonable on the following&#13;
argument.   Because the Soviet Union remains isolated from the world market,&#13;
the Soviet price structure is not under pressure to come into equilibrium with&#13;
the world market price structure, and as a result the excess of the value of&#13;
imported goods at domestic prices over the value at domestic prices of the&#13;
exports needed to pay for them does represent the creation of value.         These&#13;
"gains from trade" do not get dispersed to other sectors as they would if the&#13;
usual open economy equilibrating mechanism were at work. These earnings might&#13;
be thought of as a rent generated by the difficulty of access to the "mine" of&#13;
the external economy caused by the clumsiness of foreign trade decision&#13;
making.&#13;
Any increase in claims against foreigners (through positive net&#13;
foreign investment) constitutes another value created by foreign trade&#13;
operations, though unrealized as yet in terms of domestic absorption (vice&#13;
versa for an import surplus).     To evalute this gain in rubles it would seem&#13;
appropriate to do the opposite of what the Russians do. It seems to me that a&#13;
net export in foreign prices should be evaluated in rubles at the values at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
which that claim can be realized to add to domestic absorption i.e. at the&#13;
ruble/foreign price ratio for imports rather than for exports. As a practical&#13;
matter, however, the Soviet approach is necessary to reconcile domestic&#13;
absorption of product with the value of what has been produced.&#13;
As will be seen in some later calculations (see Table 8 in Part III),&#13;
the gains from foreign trade, in the form of the "special earnings of foreign&#13;
trade" have become a significant component of Soviet NMP in the early&#13;
eighties.   Some calculations by Treml and Kostinsky suggest that by 1978 this&#13;
item amounted to 10 percent of NMP.        Nevertheless,  on the basis of the&#13;
argument above, I see no need to make any changes in Soviet NMP to offset the&#13;
Soviet treatment of foreign trade.&#13;
6. One problem frequently discussed in interpreting the validity of&#13;
Soviet NMP data is the treatment of housing services.       Many discussions of&#13;
socialist income accounting seem to say that output utilized consists of&#13;
accumulation and consumption, that one component of the latter is personal&#13;
consumption, and that consumption of housing services is shown in the latter&#13;
in the form of depreciation on the private and public housing stock. (See for&#13;
example United Nations, Basic Principles, p. 17).      It seems impossible that&#13;
this assertion could be true, since all sources are unambiguous in asserting&#13;
that the provision of housing services is an activity of the nonmaterial&#13;
sphere.   If no output is produced in housing, a figure for utilization of&#13;
output cannot include housing output if it is to fit within output produced,&#13;
as we know it always does.&#13;
In estimating a value for housing services in the adjustment from NMP&#13;
to GNP, one problem is to impute a value to the services of privately owned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
housing.   A second is what value to put on housing services, both public and&#13;
private, inasmuch as the established price for housing is highly subsidized.&#13;
How to value housing services is an aspect of a much broader issue,&#13;
which might as well be taken up here.     As will be explained further in Part&#13;
II, the prices in use in the Soviet economy satisfy neither of the common&#13;
national income accounting standards, i.e. the factor cost standard which&#13;
would allow us to put a "production potential" interpretation on the&#13;
aggregates and their components, nor the welfare standard that would permit us&#13;
to interpret the figures as having as a common denominator the contribution of&#13;
the various elements to welfare.    Inasmuch as neither of those inferences is&#13;
our goal in this estimatiaon of GNP, it does not matter that prices do not&#13;
satisfy either of these criteria.&#13;
The goal of this effort is to end up with a figure for Soviet GNP&#13;
that purports to show what Soviet GNP would be if all its components were&#13;
valued  in  dollars.     Since,  as  will  be  seen  below,  the most   reliable&#13;
information available   on the dollar/ruble ratios of the various components of&#13;
GNP refer to established Soviet prices, we want our GNP figure in national&#13;
currency units to be valued in established prices.     Hence the goal should be&#13;
to value housing services (or any other component of GNP) at the price&#13;
actually paid, rather than at some price adjusted to a factor cost (or other)&#13;
valuation standard.   The established price should also be used in estimating&#13;
the value of owner-occupied housing.&#13;
7.   Some peculiarities of Soviet depreciation practices need to be&#13;
explained as a basis for what follows. Depreciation charges (amortizatsionnye&#13;
otchisleniia) in the USSR consist of two components, i.e. a portion intended&#13;
to finance major repair of an asset during its service life (capital repair)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
and a portion to recover the original value of the asset. The capital repair&#13;
portion can be generally ignored in our calculations.      Capital repair is an&#13;
activity that creates value added, but in figuring value added in the&#13;
activities for which it is performed, it is netted out as a material input.&#13;
As long as we are careful to deal only with the portion of depreciation&#13;
charges that is intended to recover original value, we can forget about&#13;
capital repair.     (It should be noted parenthetically that there is some&#13;
dispute as to how to handle capital repair.     In some of its calculations the&#13;
CIA treats it as final product, under the investment heading. I would prefer&#13;
to think of it like any other current input devoted to supporting production,&#13;
and  thus  omit  it as   intermediate  product.    Becker  in his   calculations&#13;
apparently follows the same interpretation).&#13;
In Soviet accounting practice depreciation is charged on the assets&#13;
of  state   and  co-operative   "economic   organizations".    Depreciation   on&#13;
collective farm property is calculated, but is not routinely included in the&#13;
depreciation series reported in Soviet statistical handbooks, which is&#13;
described as "depreciation in state enterprises and economic organizations".&#13;
The Soviet practice of ignoring depreciation on capital assets of budget&#13;
organizations would appear to be close to the western practice of excluding&#13;
depreciation on government capital, and so no correction is needed.       In the&#13;
adjustment to GNP, therefore, it is necessary to add depreciation as reported&#13;
in the handbooks and an estimate of depreciation on collective farm assets and&#13;
on private housing. (Government-owned housing is operated by units that fall&#13;
within the category of "economic organizations").&#13;
8.    A slight   correction  should  be added   to the commonly made&#13;
statement that the output of nonmaterial production is not included in NMP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
In correcting gross output of any sector of material production to net&#13;
product, what is subtracted is material inputs, including depreciation.      But&#13;
firms in the material production sphere may also purchase services from firms&#13;
in the nonproduction sphere, such as R and D services, banking and insurance&#13;
services, educational and health services, etc., and in contrast to western&#13;
practice those particular interfirm purchases are not subtracted to get from&#13;
gross  output  to value   added.    As long as such services are considered&#13;
intermediate rather than final product, they should be deleted when value&#13;
added in nonmaterial sectors is computed for addition to reported NMP. Social&#13;
services paid for by enterprises, but provided gratis to employees, such as&#13;
health care, reimbursement for travel, etc., are also left as a component of&#13;
value created in the material production sectors, and should be removed since&#13;
they will be picked up in our estimates of value created in the nonmaterial&#13;
sectors.   I have found no information on the value of these items for the&#13;
USSR, but we know that for other socialist countries their importance ranges&#13;
from 3 to 6 percent of NMP and I can think of no reason the share would be&#13;
higher in the USSR.&#13;
Possible Approaches for Estimating Soviet GNP&#13;
Two alternative approaches to estimating Soviet output according to&#13;
the coverage of western concepts are:     (a) to build a more or less complete&#13;
set of national income and product accounts from quite disaggregated data; and&#13;
(b) to take NMP as officially reported and add to it an estimate of output&#13;
created in nommaterial spheres and depreciation.&#13;
The first approach has been used extensively in western research on&#13;
the Soviet economy (cf. Bergson, Becker, Nimitz, Anderson, Bornstein, and CIA,&#13;
1975 and 1978).    This work goes far beyond the estimation of a single GNP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
figure in rubles.    It usually involves development of an articulated set of&#13;
accounts, adjustment of the figures to a more economically meaningful&#13;
valuation  concept   (mainly  to  some  sort  of  factor  cost  valuation),  and&#13;
estimation of a value in dollars.       In these western recalculations, when&#13;
valuation is at market prices,     results are close to Soviet data for the&#13;
portion of the total where the two approaches overlap.     For example, Abraham&#13;
Becker demonstrated a very close agreement between his independent GNP&#13;
estimates for 1959-1965 corrected for nonmaterial production and the figures&#13;
reported by the USSR Central Statistical Administration for NMP for the same&#13;
years.   (Becker, 1969, pp. 34-37).    In no case did his estimate differ from&#13;
the Soviet figure by more than 1.8 percent.        Since the direction of the&#13;
difference was different for different years the difference may have been&#13;
explained in part by timing. His cumulative total for the seven years (1076.1&#13;
billion rubles) differed imperceptibly from the Soviet figure (1076.5 billion&#13;
rubles).&#13;
Similarly, after constructing their GNP estimates for 1970, the CIA&#13;
analysts sought to reconcile their results with the Soviet NMP figure for the&#13;
same year. Allowing for the known difference in the respective methodologies&#13;
they found the two figures very close.     (CIA, USSR:   Gross National Product&#13;
Accounts - 1970, and USSR:      Toward a Reconcilation of Marxist and Western&#13;
Measures of National Income). The CIA GNP estimate is 4 percent larger than&#13;
the augmented Soviet figure.&#13;
The CIA accounts for 1970 also contain a table for GNP by sector of&#13;
origin at market prices that can be compared with the analogous Soviet figures&#13;
as in Table 2. Note several things about this comparison. (a) The fact that&#13;
the Soviet figure for transport and communications is so much lower than the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
CIA figure corroborates my understanding that the Soviet statisticians exclude&#13;
passenger service and communications serving persons and the nonmaterial&#13;
sphere from NMP). (b) One reason the CIA figure for trade and other branches&#13;
of material production is so much below the Soviet figure is that the CIA does&#13;
not include in earnings from trade the "special earnings from foreign trade"&#13;
which can be estimated at about 8.2 billion rubles in 1970 (see below). That&#13;
correction would reduce the difference between the CIA figure and the Central&#13;
Statistical Administration figure for NMP to 9.6 billion rubles.       (c) It is&#13;
likely that a significant share of the "unallocated" element in the CIA total&#13;
should be assigned to this sector.     This unallocated amount is what is left&#13;
over from the control totals they estimate on the income side (total wages,&#13;
profits, and other state incomes) after documentable assignments by sector.&#13;
In this table "trade and other branches of material production" is a highly&#13;
miscellaneous sector, and it would not be surprising if in trying to build up&#13;
value added created therein, they would miss much that gets into the control&#13;
totals. (d) The Russians may well have handled some data differently from the&#13;
way the CIA did in defining borders between sectors - the large Soviet figure&#13;
for construction may include considerable own-account activity, carried on by&#13;
enterprises in other sectors, which the CIA left in industry.&#13;
I believe that the CIA's unallocated value added (made up of 11.039&#13;
billion rubles of unallocated "other and imputed income" and 21.469 billion&#13;
rubles to turnover and other indirect taxes) can be allocated reasonably to&#13;
bring the CIA and Soviet sectoral subaggregates much closer.        Turnover and&#13;
other indirect taxes are very difficult to assign, and it is plausible that&#13;
much of the total is in fact assignable to construction, trade, and services&#13;
(lines 5 and 6 in Table 2).      The other and imputed income (of households)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
could originate in any of these sectors.    In short, it is reasonable to argue&#13;
that if the CIA analysts tracked down the sector of origin of this unallocated&#13;
income, 9.6 billion rubles of it could end up assigned to the branches of&#13;
material production, so that the CIA's estimate of GNP created in the sectors&#13;
of  material   production  would  be   the  same  as  the   Central  Statistical&#13;
Administration's result of 289.9 billion rubles.&#13;
Given that Soviet descriptions of their acounting are never presented&#13;
in enough detail to permit us to know for sure what they have done, or what&#13;
values they are using for some of the component magnitudes, and that the&#13;
western efforts involve estimating many components from less than precise&#13;
statements, the correspondences with Soviet NMP found in both Becker's and the&#13;
CIA's calculations are remarkably good.&#13;
It is always useful to have the detailed recalculation, especially as&#13;
that provides a whole set of accounts rather than a single GNP number.       But&#13;
such a full reconstruction is a very expensive undertaking, and involves a&#13;
long delay pending appearance of the data.     The thesis of this paper is that&#13;
adding depreciation and an estimate of value-added in non material sectors is&#13;
a good short-cut route for expanding Soviet NMP to GNP and that the resulting&#13;
number is as likely to be correct as the results of more elaborate&#13;
calculations.     Moreover,  the  adjustment   can  be  made  conveniently   and&#13;
expeditiously -- it can be carried out basically from the standard data&#13;
available in the Central Statistical Administration's handbook as it appears&#13;
each year.&#13;
Description of the Short-cut Method&#13;
The first step in the short-cut method is to calculate wage earnings&#13;
in the omitted sectors, and the procedure is best explained by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
illustrative calculation for 1980 shown in Table 3.    The major problem in the&#13;
calculation is that the Russians do not report explicitly the portion of&#13;
employment in transport and communication serving persons and nonmaterial&#13;
production, or numbers and incomes for military personnel.     The first can be&#13;
estimated on the basis of another table in the statistical yearbooks (see&#13;
sources and notes to Table 3) as 28-31 percent of all employment in&#13;
transportation and communication for various years in the seventies. Another&#13;
source reports that 22 percent of the labor force in transportation is engaged&#13;
in passenger transport, and 69 percent of labor in communications is engaged&#13;
in activities serving nonmaterial production (Kozak, 1979, p. 89).      The date&#13;
to which these figures refer is not given, but if we assume that they refer to&#13;
the mid seventies, those percentages applied to the respective totals imply&#13;
about 29 percent for the two nonmaterial activities together, which is very&#13;
close to what my method shows for those years.&#13;
For numbers of military personnel and their average pay and&#13;
allowances, we use western estimates, as explained in the sources and notes to&#13;
Table 3.&#13;
Other net value added in the sector of non-material production&#13;
consists primarily     of profits and other forms of accumulation,      such as&#13;
turnover tax.   It is this component of my estimate that is most likely to be&#13;
understated. Data on the turnover tax is too scanty to permit estimating the&#13;
amount of this value forming element generated in nonproductive sectors even&#13;
approximiately.   My estimating procedure for profits is to take profits as&#13;
shown in the statistical yearbooks for the municipal economy and for a&#13;
residual category that must be identical with other nonmaterial activities,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
and a share of the profits in transportation and communications proportional&#13;
to nonproductive employment in the branch. The results are shown in Table 4.&#13;
As mentioned earlier, there is a large subsidy in state housing. The&#13;
Central Statistical Administration has reported the loss incurred in operating&#13;
state housing for some years in the 1970s as follows, in billion rubles, (Nar&#13;
Khoz, 1980, p. 381):   1970-3.4; 1975-4.9; 1976-5.6; 1978-6.0; 1979-6.5; 1980-&#13;
6.9.  This loss must be excluded from value-added in the non-material sectors&#13;
if housing services are to be reflected at established prices.         It is my&#13;
understanding, however, on the basis of what the statistical yearbooks say,&#13;
that the profits figure I have used for the nonmaterial sectors in the state&#13;
sphere are already net of losses of     enterprises in that sphere, eliminating&#13;
the need for a separate adjustment.&#13;
Imputed rent on private and cooperative housing can be figured by&#13;
applying the average rent in state housing to an estimate of the stock of&#13;
private  and  cooperative  housing.    The Central Statistical Administration&#13;
regularly reports data only for the urban housing stock, divided into state-&#13;
owned and other (columns 1 and 2 of Table 5), but it is possible to estimate&#13;
the rural housing stock by building on some earlier estimates in Smith,&#13;
1973.    The method   is  to project  the stock by adjusting for attrition,&#13;
absorption of rural areas into urban areas, and new construction. The results&#13;
are shown in column 3 of Table 5.     Those numbers seem reasonably consistent&#13;
with a statement that the value of privately owned fixed assets (almost&#13;
exclusively housing, surely) and cooperative housing was 100 billion rubles in&#13;
1972, compared to 234 billion rubles for all housing.          Since some rural&#13;
housing is probably state owned, the state/private division is close to half&#13;
and half in square meters, but the average quality of the private portion is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
below the state owned portion. Taking all rural and private housing together,&#13;
multiplying by 2/3 to convert from total space to living space (to which the&#13;
rent rate refers) and multiplying by the average rent gives the figures shown&#13;
in the last column of Table 5.&#13;
The depreciation data regularly reported in the Soviet statistical&#13;
yearbooks (shown in column 1 of Table 6) diverges from what we would like to&#13;
have by: a) omission of depreciation on collective farm assets, and b)&#13;
omission of depreciation on cooperatively- and privately-owned housing.      The&#13;
task is to estimate the value of those stocks and to figure depreciation on&#13;
them at the same rate as in the rest of agriculture, and as in public housing.&#13;
Two series routinely reported for collective farm capital cover&#13;
"productive fixed assets in agriculture" and "all fixed assets and material&#13;
inventories owned by collective farms". The first is too narrow, omitting the&#13;
fixed assets in other activities engaged in by collective farms (industry,&#13;
construction, housing, etc.).    The second is suitable in terms of activities&#13;
covered but is too broad by including inventories. In the 70's the two series&#13;
have moved quite similarly.&#13;
In 1972 when the fixed assets of state and co-operative enterprises&#13;
were inventoried and revalued the fixed assets of collective farms were&#13;
reported as 56.1 billion rubles on January 1, compared to the 67 billion&#13;
rubles for the broad concept mentioned above, and 43.8 billion rubles for the&#13;
narrow one.   What I do is to extend the 56.1 figure to other years in the&#13;
1970's   in  accordance   with   the  collective   farm   fixed  asset   series.&#13;
Depreciation on these assets is reported as 2.7 billion rubles for 1970 (CIA,&#13;
USSR: Gross National Product Accounts, 1970) and I figure depreciation at the&#13;
corresponding rate for each year of the decade.       The resulting figures are&#13;
shown in column 2 of Table 6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
As mentioned earlier, the value of all housing on January 1, 1973 was&#13;
reported as 234 billion rubles, and the value of privately owned fixed assets&#13;
(surely almost exclusively housing) and co-operative housing was 100 billion&#13;
rubles.   Moving the latter figure in accordance with the data on stock of&#13;
urban private plus rural housing (from Table 5) and multiplying by the&#13;
depreciation rate on state housing gives the results shwon in column 3 of&#13;
Table 6.    Column 4 in the table is the total for all depreciation.        When&#13;
profits and wages in nonmaterial production, imputed value of services of&#13;
private housing and comprehensive depreciation are added to NMP produced as&#13;
reported in the statistical yearbooks the results are as shown in Table 7.&#13;
There are two known errors in this figure.      One is the failure to&#13;
eliminate from the NMP figures with which we started the purchases by material&#13;
production enterprises of services from firms in the nonproductive sectors,&#13;
and services provided to employees of enterprises in the material production&#13;
sectors. As explained earlier, this might involve an overstatement of as much&#13;
as 6 percent of NMP (which would be 23.1 billion rubles in 1976 and 27.5&#13;
billion  rubles   in  1980).    The  other  is  the  strong   likelihood  of  an&#13;
underestimate of value added in the nonmaterial sectors.      As a clue to the&#13;
possible magnitude of the latter omission consider that my figure for 1976&#13;
(490 billion rubles)   differs from that produced by the CIA for the same year&#13;
by 15 billion rubles.      Allowing for the fact that my figure includes 36&#13;
billion rubles of gains from foreign trade which they omit, but omits the 15&#13;
billion rubles of capital repair they include, their estimate exceeds mine by&#13;
36 billion rubles on other accounts.      Taking the difference of 36 billion&#13;
rubles as a clue to the amount the CIA calculations capture by working down&#13;
from control totals instead of building up from the wage bill in nonmaterial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
sectors, my estimate could be somewhat on the low side--perhaps by as much as&#13;
2.6 percent, i.e., (36-23.1)/490.&#13;
An additional test is to compare the GNP/NMP ratio for my calculation&#13;
with that found for other CPE's. This test suggests the opposite conclusioin,&#13;
since my GNP/NMP ratio of 1.29 for 1980 is higher than that for any country&#13;
except Bulgaria (the one which rests on the least substantial evidential&#13;
base).   The only reconciliation of these opposing implications I can see is&#13;
that sale of non material inputs to the production on sphere may be unusuallly&#13;
high in the USSR.&#13;
Assuming that Soviet calculation of NMP is no more inaccurate than&#13;
other countries' estimate of GNP, I would conclude that my GNP figure should&#13;
be within 5 percent of any reasonably professional calculation of Soviet GNP.&#13;
PART II. PECULIARITIES OF THE SOVIET PRICE AND FISCAL SYSTEM&#13;
As already explained, the fact that Soviet pricing is peculiar is&#13;
irrelevant to the problem of figuring Soviet GNP in dollars as long as one&#13;
uses conversion ratios based on price relatives for established prices.      But&#13;
given the possibility that attempts may be made to squeeze some other&#13;
inferences out of the data generated in this operation, it may be useful to&#13;
say a few things about Soviet pricing practices and their impact on structure,&#13;
and on the relationship between GNP at factor cost and at established prices.&#13;
(1) Soviet prices are poor measures of either factor cost or&#13;
contribution to welfare.    They differ from factor costs by arbitrary profit&#13;
markups (high in some cases, negative in others); by turnover taxes, and by&#13;
the absence of realistic interest or rent charges and quasi-rents.      They are&#13;
not proportional to welfare because of disequilibrium in the markets for final&#13;
consumer goods, and because of the absence of a mechanism by which the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
population could express its preferences regarding the allocation of resources&#13;
between consumption and non-consumption.&#13;
To help remove some of the problems this causes in drawing inferences&#13;
from GNP data at established prices, Bergson suggested an adjusted factor cost&#13;
standard as a basis for correcting various aggregates.          The adjustments&#13;
involve eliminating the turnover tax, profits, and subsidies that are&#13;
componets of various aggregates when valued at established prices, and adding&#13;
notional amounts for rent and interest.     This tradition has been followed in&#13;
most western work on estimating income and product in socialist countries.&#13;
The main effect of these adjustments in application to sector or&#13;
origin estimates has been to reduce the share of industry and to raise that of&#13;
agriculture.    In end-use estimates the effect is to reduce the share of&#13;
consumption and to raise that of investment and defense.        Overall, GNP at&#13;
factor cost is appreciably less than at established prices. (See for example&#13;
Becker, 1969, Table K-2 and CIA, 1975, p.l.)       This is because the amounts&#13;
added for national interest and rent are much less than the net tax markups&#13;
removed.&#13;
But the nature of redistributions through the Soviet fiscal system&#13;
has changed appreciably in recent years, as a result of the declining relative&#13;
importance of the turnover tax compared to their forms of cost-price markup,&#13;
the more even generation of profits across sectors, and the rapid growth of&#13;
agricultural subsidies.    In its gross national product accounts for the USSR&#13;
for 1970, the CIA found that the end-use allocation at established prices did&#13;
not differ markedly from that at factor cost, as shown by the following&#13;
tabulation (in percent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
At established        At factor&#13;

Other public sector (incl def.)           8.1                 9.1&#13;
Five major distortions operating at the present time should be noted&#13;
as relevant to certain kinds of questions that might be asked about Soviet GNP&#13;
accounts.&#13;
1) There is a very large subsidy to agriculture, amounting to about&#13;
37 billion rubles in 1980 (Treml, "Subsidies in Soviet Agriculture").         In&#13;
relation to 1980 net value added in agriculture of 69 billion rubles according&#13;
to the Soviet accounts, this is a major distortion.&#13;
2) In Eastern Europe there has been a move away from the absurdly low&#13;
subsidized rents for housing, but proposals for this kind of reform in the&#13;
USSR have not gotten very far, and as indicated above the loss on state&#13;
housing alone, even with strongly understated depreciation, was almost 7&#13;
billion rubles in 1980.     Doubled to allow for the underpricing of private&#13;
housing in our estimate of GNP, this constitutes about 2 percent of GNP.&#13;
3) The "special earnings from foreign trade" have been estimated at&#13;
49.5 rubles in 1978 (Treml and Kostinsky, 1981, p. 30), or about 8 percent of&#13;
GNP.   As indicated above, I consider this a legitimate component of GNP, but&#13;
if it is thought to be an unjustified markup, its distorting effect probably&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
shows up most strongly in sector-of-origin structure by inflating the share of&#13;
trade in GNP.    We lack adequate information for evalutating its distorting&#13;
effect on GNP by end-use.    Treml and Kostinsky estimate the value of imports&#13;
in domestic and foreign trade prices for a large number of product categories&#13;
(Treml, 1981, pp. 129-131). The ratio of domestic to foreign trade prices is&#13;
relatively low for primary products and machinery, higher for intermediates,&#13;
and highest for consumer goods.     My expectation would therefore be that the&#13;
distorting effect on GNP by end-use would be generally to inflate consumption&#13;
and understate investment and defense.&#13;
4) Military conscription in any society usually distorts GNP by&#13;
understating the factor cost of manpower inputs into the defense component of&#13;
GNP. This is a palpable effect in the USSR accounts because of the large size&#13;
of the armed forces and the disparity between civilian and miitary pay.&#13;
Valuing the services of five million persons in the armed forces not at the&#13;
1500 rubles per year of Table 3, but at the 3,000 rubles per year earned by&#13;
the average member of the state labor force, would add 7.5 billion rubles to&#13;
GNP, -- well over 1 percent.&#13;
5) In the Soviet Union we may be counting as final product&#13;
considerable amounts of what is really intermediate product that should be&#13;
netted out. We already mentioned services of the nonproductive sphere sold to&#13;
the productive sphere. Other such elements are various functions in which the&#13;
government engages to support production, but for which production enterprises&#13;
are not charged, such as geological exploration, land melioration, fire&#13;
protection, R and D, and so on. To the extent that these expenditures have an&#13;
investment character, they may be final products, but their depreciation and&#13;
depletion is never charged against output, and surely large amounts of them&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
benefit only current production. It may be that there is more of that double&#13;
counting in the USSR than in other societies, though I believe it would be&#13;
difficult to make that case.&#13;
PART III. CONVERSION OF ESTIMATES OF SOVIET GNP TO DOLLARS&#13;
The existing western work on converting ruble estimates of Soviet GNP&#13;
to dollars has been based on use of detailed purchasing power parity ratios&#13;
for various end use categories, developed from price ratios of carefully&#13;
matched US and Soviet commodities.     (See for example Becker, 1973; Edwards,&#13;
1979; Schroeder, 1981).    In the Schroeder study, the dollar/ruble ratio for&#13;
consumption is based on a sample of 334 consumer goods items. In a study for&#13;
1976, (Edwards, 1979), the Soviet-quantity-weighted average implied for all&#13;
GNP turned out to be 2.48 dollars per ruble or .40 rubles per dollar.        The&#13;
sample on which the price ratio for that conversion was based contained 250&#13;
consumer goods items, 245 machinery and equipment items, and 277 examples of&#13;
construction. Use of U.S. quantities as weights gives a lower dollar/ruble&#13;
ratio and the geometric mean of the U.S. weighted and Soviet weighted ratios&#13;
is 2.04 dollars per ruble.&#13;
There are some Soviet statements regarding ruble/dollar ratios,&#13;
though most of them refer to producing sectors rather than to end use&#13;
categories or to GNP as a whole.      The most general of these statements is&#13;
implied in figures for the dollar value of Soviet national income (i.e. NMP)&#13;
"in accordance with relative prices" published in the statistical yearbooks.&#13;
These are much lower than the 2.48 dollars per ruble cited above, i.e. 1.32 in&#13;
1970,  rising to 1.61 in 1976.       For 1977, the last year for which this&#13;
comparison was published, the figure is 1.67.      The explanation given in the&#13;
source is very sketchy, but Treml and Gallik interpret those comparisons as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
being based on a Soviet-weighted relative price ratio based on a sample of&#13;
commodities  (Treml,  1973, p. 9).     Ostensibly,  therefore,  it should match&#13;
conceptually the 2.48 dollars per ruble cited above, except for the narrower&#13;
scope due to the fact that it refers to NMP rather than to GNP.&#13;
The Soviet limitation to material production could account for most&#13;
of the difference.   The purchasing power of the ruble for the labor-intensive&#13;
services is higher than the average for material production, so a dollar/ruble&#13;
ratio for material production alone should indeed be lower than for GNP. The&#13;
Schroeder, 1981, study cited above calculated a Soviet-weighted ratio for 1976&#13;
of 5.71 dollars per ruble for household services, education and health (and a&#13;
U.S.  quantity weighted    ratio  of  2.35  dollars  per  ruble).    This  omits&#13;
government services, where the dollar/ruble ratio is probably still higher. A&#13;
global conversion ratio combining the Soviet dollar/ruble ratio for NMP and&#13;
the Schroeder Soviet-weighted dollar/ruble ratio for services according to the&#13;
weights implied in Table 7 would result in a GNP ratio of 2.46 dollars per&#13;
ruble.   Thus,  the conversion ratio the Central Statistical Administration&#13;
cites may not be strongly inconsistent with the Edwards figure for 1976 cited&#13;
above.&#13;
In the absence of any good evidence as to how the Soviet&#13;
statisticians came up with that dollar/ruble ratio, however, I consider it&#13;
best to stick with the western studies, for which we at least know the sort of&#13;
information being used.&#13;
Since the goal is a conversion ratio that may share some properties&#13;
of the exchange rates used in the World Atlas for converting GDP per capita&#13;
for other countries into dollars, there is some thought of using for some of&#13;
the CPE's various kinds of exchange rates either directly for the conversir&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
or for adjusting    ppp's.    Something should therefore be said about what&#13;
exchange rate information exists for the USSR.&#13;
The official Soviet exchange rate in 1976 was 1.333 dollars per&#13;
ruble, which is far below the geometric mean ppp of 2.04 dollars per ruble for&#13;
GNP cited above for 1976.     This exchange rate is completely artificial, and&#13;
the USSR has made no effort to make it serve some economically meaningful&#13;
function as have some of the other CPEs.     I see no way a case could be made&#13;
that this exchange rate is a better reflection of relative price levels than&#13;
the calculated ppp.&#13;
It has been suggested that a better approximation of the exchange&#13;
rate that might emerge if the USSR were to move toward a more open economy is&#13;
the ruble cost of earning a dollar's worth of foreign exchange or its&#13;
reciprocal--the dollars earned per ruble spent on producing exports. The most&#13;
detailed work available on this matter is that done by Treml and Kostinsky&#13;
(Treml and Kostinsky,    1981).   Table 8 shows their estimates of domestic&#13;
(ruble) and foreign (dollar) values of Soviet exports and imports for the&#13;
decade of the seventies.   This information permits computation of the specials&#13;
earnings from foreign trade discussed earlier in Part I, and those values are1&#13;
shown in the table, but we are here concerned only with the dollar/ruble&#13;
parities for exports and impQrts.&#13;
As table 8 shows the parity for goods exported in 1976 was 1.52&#13;
dollars per ruble, intermediate betwieen the official exchange rate and the&#13;
geometric ppp.   The Soviet situation is thus somewhat like that in the other&#13;
CPE's,   It should be mentioned, however, that unlike in the other CPE's the&#13;
same kind of measure figured by looking at foreign and domestic prices of&#13;
Soviet imports suggests a much lower conversion ratio, i.e., .63 dollars. per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
ruble.   The average for all traded goods would therefore be about one dollar&#13;
per ruble.   I gather that the exchange rate/PPP deviation implied by a ppp of&#13;
2.04 and an exchange rate for all tradeables of about 1 dollar per ruble would&#13;
be far out of line with what the ICP project found for other countries at&#13;
comparable levels of GDP per capita.&#13;
To conclude, the major conversion rates we might use as an&#13;
alternative to that derived from straight dollar valuation are thus:       1) an&#13;
analogue of the geometric mean of a U.S.quantity weighted ppp and a Soviet&#13;
quantity weighted analogous to those used in the ICP project; 2) some kind of&#13;
dollar ruble parity that emerges from Soviet foreign trade operations, such as&#13;
the realized parity of all tradeables or the dollars earned per ruble&#13;
expenditure on producting goods for export.     Table 9 shows the levels of GNP&#13;
per capita in dollars that would emerge from these alternatives for 1976, the&#13;
year for which the most information is available for converting rubles to&#13;
dollars. The table also projects these estimates to later years. The problem&#13;
is which of these several per capita- dollar numbers would be the most&#13;
comparable in some sense to the GDP per capita figures in dollars for open&#13;
economies published in the World Atlas where the exchange rate is treated as&#13;
valid   for  conversion   purposes.     That   question  involves   a  kind   of&#13;
counterfactual premise that I find it difficult to deal with--there is little&#13;
basis for arguing how any of these figures might change if the Soviet economy&#13;
were opened up and an equilibrium exchange rate allowed to emerge.      Still it&#13;
seems to me that in the Soviet case, at least, using the exchange rate for&#13;
tradeables would be very misleading. As one indication, commercial energy use&#13;
in the USSR in 1979 at 5.793 kg of coal equivalent per capita is in the same&#13;
range as many industrialized market economies with GNP per capita of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
$10,000.    (World Development Report,   1982).   The Soviet economy is very&#13;
wasteful of energy, but that kind of energy use figure makes it difficult to&#13;
believe its GNP per capita could be as low as the $2,499 shown in Table 9 for&#13;
1979.&#13;
In my view the most useful perspective that can be had on dollar-&#13;
valued income per capita in the USSR is the figure derived by using an ICP-&#13;
type ppp. For that indicator we can at least define the meaning of the number&#13;
derived.&#13;
PART IV. GROWTH RATES: ADJUSTING FROM BENCHMARK TO CURRENT YEARS&#13;
One can approach the problem of figuring the dollar value of Soviet&#13;
GNP in years later than the benchmark year either by projecting the benchmark&#13;
figure in dollars by an index of GNP growth, or by updating the dollar/ruble&#13;
conversion ratio and applying it to estimates of Soviet GNP in national&#13;
currency units for later years.     The method for estimating GNP in national&#13;
currency units suggested above is simple enough that it is possible to&#13;
maintain a reasonably current series on Soviet GNP in current rubles.        The&#13;
issues in developing price indexes for adjusting the benchmark dollar/ruble&#13;
conversion ratio are no different from those in developing a growth index for&#13;
adjusting Soviet GNP in dollars for the benchmark year, and I will concentrate&#13;
on the latter.&#13;
The simplest way to update the dollar estimates of Soviet GNP for the&#13;
benchmark year would be to move it forward by a measure of GNP growth. That&#13;
is conceptually not very satisfactory.&#13;
As explained in the previous section on possible conversion ratios my&#13;
preference is for a ppp of the type used in the ICP approach, i.e., a&#13;
geometric mean of a U.S. quantity weighted aggregation of dollar/ruble price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
relatives and a Soviet quantity weighted aggregation of the same relatives.&#13;
The formula for direct calculation of Soviet GNP in dollars in 1976 according&#13;
to that definition is&#13;
S Sov p$76       SqSo  PR76   1/2&#13;
i  i    i     i         ~x  Sq usP7&#13;
SqS   PiSq                  sqUS pR76    i   i&#13;
The problem is what would be the form of a production index by which&#13;
the above expression could be multiplied to result in the same expression, but&#13;
in 1980 prices.     There probably is one, but it would obviously be a very&#13;
complicated one, and it is not our goal here to suggest a complicated new&#13;
index that would need to be calculated for updating the benchmark&#13;
conversion.    The important question is whether any of the output indexes&#13;
already available (which are characterized by early-year price weights) can be&#13;
reasonably expected to have a definite bias. Without taking the time to work&#13;
it out, my expectation is that they would not, basically because there seems&#13;
no reason to expect any systematic correlation between changes in U.S./Soviet&#13;
price relatives and U.S./Soviet quantity relatives between the benchmark year&#13;
and the year for which the GNP per capita estimate in dollars is being made.&#13;
The possible bias in applying an early-year Soviet price weighted&#13;
index to a benchmark figure calculated by using an ICP-type ppp adjusted by&#13;
some formula for the ER/ppp deviation index defies imagination, and there&#13;
seems little profit in trying to tackle that question here.&#13;
There is, however, a choice to be made between two rather disparate&#13;
ruble-weighted indexes for the growth of aggregate output, i.e., the Soviet&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
NMP index and independent western calculations of Soviet GNP growth. A great&#13;
deal of western work has been done to evaluate the validity of Soviet output&#13;
indexes, by making independent aggregations (sectoral and global) from primary&#13;
official Soviet output data.     These studies have always concluded that the&#13;
Soviet NMP index exaggerated the growth of the economy as a whole.          One&#13;
detailed look at the issues is available in Cohn, 1972, which makes&#13;
comparisons for the whole period from 1928 to the mid sixties.       He showed,&#13;
first, that the difference between Soviet and western indexes of national&#13;
product growth had decreased over time.     Second, he concluded that a small&#13;
part of the difference was a "coverage-induced gap," (i.e., due to the&#13;
omission of services in the Soviet index) and that a little more was due to&#13;
differences in sectoral weighting (Soviet NMP aggregations weighted the&#13;
rapidly growing sectors more heavily than western aggregations within the&#13;
material  production sphere   did).    Most  of  the difference,   however,  was&#13;
attributable to Soviet growth indexes for individual sectors that exceeded&#13;
corresponding western computations.    This third gap was especially important&#13;
in industry, which is not surprising since many students of the subject have&#13;
concluded that it is in industry that the new product pricing problem, use of&#13;
gross rather than net output, and other peculiarities of Soviet practice offer&#13;
the greatest possibility for upward bias in Soviet output indexes.&#13;
The most complete western recalculation of Soviet GNP growth&#13;
appearing on a current basis is that made by the CIA.     Their procedure is to&#13;
calculate their own set of sectoral real growth indices, and then weight, them&#13;
into a GNP growth index by the 1970 structure of value-added, by sector, at&#13;
adjusted factor cost.      (Allocation,  1981, p. 285).    The sectoral growth&#13;
indexes are developed with varying degrees of complexity.    The most important&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
sectoral index, that for industry, is an aggregation at an approximation of&#13;
factor cost of official Soviet physical output indexes for a sample of over&#13;
300 individual items.   The details are explained in Whitehouse and Converse,&#13;
1979, and that source cites earlier descriptions which show how the&#13;
calculation of the index has changed over time.      The index for agricultural&#13;
output is calculated by a kind of double deflation method that starts with a&#13;
constant price valuation of 41 agricultural products and adjusts this to a net&#13;
basis by subtracting intra-agricultural consumption of those items.      Most of&#13;
the  output  data used   is official   Soviet output   series.   This index is&#13;
described in Carey and Havelka, 1979.     I believe that the U.S. Department of&#13;
Agriculture produces a closely analogous index for Soviet net agricultural&#13;
output.&#13;
Descriptions of the real output indexes for other sectors (transport&#13;
and communication, construction, trade, services, etc.) used in the GNP index&#13;
are much sketchier but they are all in the same spirit of aggregating some&#13;
physical measure of output at value added weights, except for services, where&#13;
I believe employment, uncorrected for productivity change, is used.&#13;
This CIA GNP index is routinely available in a variety of sources--&#13;
one of the sources for current data, which appears soon after the reference&#13;
year is in the Hearings each year by the JEC, listed in our bibliography as&#13;
Allocation of Resources in the Soviet Union and China.&#13;
It seems unnecessary to do a detailed update of Cohn's reconciliation&#13;
to the most recent decade, but a quick check shows the following.        The CIA&#13;
index of Soviet GNP growth for 1970-1980 is 137 versus the Soviet index for&#13;
NMP of 162, a difference of about 1.7 percentage points in average annual&#13;
growth rates.   In absolute terms, there is a difference of about 95 billion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
rubles in 1980 to be accounted for, i.e. the difference between applying the&#13;
CIA GNP index versus the Soviet NMP index to the CIA's estimate of 1970 GNP at&#13;
established prices.   What are the main reasons for this divergence, and what&#13;
does its composition suggest about the best index to use?&#13;
1) During this decade the "coverage-induced gap" has disappeared or&#13;
works in a direction opposite to that which Cohn found.       Stripping the CIA&#13;
index for GNP to cover only material production reduces the global growth rate&#13;
slightly.   (One can do this only approximately since the CIA's sectors cannot&#13;
be fully reconciled with the material-nonmaterial split).&#13;
2) Insofar as it can be disaggregated by sectors, the Soviet NMP&#13;
calculation seems to weight, the more rapidly growing sectors a bit more&#13;
heavily that the CIA does, as shown in the following tabulation of the&#13;
relative importance of the three sectors that are comparable between the two&#13;
calculations.&#13;
Soviet        CIA&#13;
Industry                         57.5        55.9&#13;
Agriculture                      24.6        25.1&#13;
Construction                     11.5         9.0&#13;
Industry and construction are sectors growing faster than the average,&#13;
agriculture lower than the average. It can be figured that the difference due&#13;
to weighting accounts for about 2 billion rubles of the 95 billion ruble&#13;
overall difference.&#13;
3) As for the effect of possible differences in the sectoral growth&#13;
rates that underly the respective Soviet and CIA NNP indexes, one can go only&#13;
a short way toward locating in what sectors the discrepancy lies; the USSR&#13;
does not publish the actual sectoral indexes underlying its NMP aggregate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
which we would need for comparison with the CIA sectoral indices.        We must&#13;
accordingly use surrogates for the Soviet side, i.e. the Soviet indexes of&#13;
gross output of industry and of agriculture, and the Soviet series for&#13;
"construction and installation work (in comparable prices)."       There are no&#13;
Soviet-calculated close surrogates for the other sectors.&#13;
The Soviet index is much higher in industry (an index of 178 versus&#13;
the CIA index of 151), perhaps slightly higher in agriculture (110 gross&#13;
output compared to CIA's 93 for GNP created, though much of this difference&#13;
probably gets washed out when the Soviet statisticians go to net product of&#13;
agriculture), and lower in construction. The higher Soviet index for industry&#13;
would account for about 40 billion rubles of the 95 billion ruble difference.&#13;
4) It has been suggested that the CIA's GNP index may have a downward&#13;
bias, originating in a downward bias in its industrial output index.         Any&#13;
index which is based on a fixed sample of outputs that is enlarged only&#13;
infrequently could be downward biased because it would not capture the&#13;
comparatively more rapid growth of new products added to industry's output in&#13;
perods between enlargement of the sample.     If this is in fact the case, that&#13;
would be another element, impossible to quantify, narrowing the 95 billion&#13;
dollar difference from the other side.&#13;
5) Finally, I believe that some more of the difference may be&#13;
accounted for by the inclusion in the Soviet figure, and exclusion from the&#13;
CIA figure, of the special earnings of foreign trade, which have grown rapidly&#13;
over the decade, i.e. from 8.1 billion rubles in 1970 to 50.4 billion rubles&#13;
in 1978, or 26 percent per year.       I consider the diversion of increasing&#13;
amounts of resources to production for export rather than using these reources&#13;
to produce inefficiently the goods that are imported to be a form of real&#13;
&#13;

productivity growth and would like to see that effect reflected in our measure&#13;
of GNP growth.   Thus, on this count also, I believe the CIA index for Soviet&#13;
GNP growth may be slightly downward biased.&#13;
My conclusion is that it would be desirable to use an independent&#13;
estimate of GNP growth, rather than the official Soviet index, or at least to&#13;
correct for the hypothesized upward bias of the industry component of Soviet&#13;
NMP growth index.   There may be some reluctance to accept western GNP growth&#13;
indexes, especially since the main one routinely available is produced by the&#13;
CIA, but depending on how the dollar totals are to be used, that reluctance&#13;
might be offset by a desire not to see the dollar totals for Soviet GNP become&#13;
too large.&#13;

publication of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the number&#13;
rose from 4.3 million in 1970 to 4.8 million in 1979. These figures are&#13;
in reasonably close agreement with CIA estimates reported each year in&#13;
testimony before Congress (Allocation of Resources in the Soviet Union and&#13;
China) when the latter are adjusted for the CIA omission of internal&#13;
security and construction troops. I use the ACDA figures, extrapolating&#13;
to 5 million in 1980. In its GNP calculation for 1970 the CIA used a&#13;
figure of about 1200 rubles per person for pay and subsistence (USSR:&#13;
Gross National Product Accounts, 1970), and I have adjusted this upward&#13;
smoothly to 1500 rubles per person for 1980. Social insurance rates are&#13;

rate probably has little relation to actual depreciation, and is in&#13;
fact spent only for capital repair, but I use it because it has some&#13;
official standing.&#13;

Sources and notes to Table 8:    Trade in dollars is calculated as trade in foreign trade&#13;
rubles as given in the foreign trade handbooks, converted by the official exchange&#13;
rate for the dollar, available in Marer's overview paper.&#13;
Trade in domestic prices for 1970-1978 is from Treml and Kostinsky, 1981, p.30; for&#13;
1979-1980 I have extrapolated their R/$ ratios with slight modifications.&#13;
As explained in Part I, special earnings from foreign trade consists of the excess of&#13;
the domestic value of imports over the domestic cost of exports, plus the excess of&#13;
exports over imports in foreign prices converted to rubles at the R/$ parity for&#13;
exports (unless X-M is negative, in which case the R/$ parity for imports is used).&#13;

Notes and Sources for Table 9.&#13;
a)  For 1976, GNP of 490 billion rubles in 1970 prices is converted&#13;
by  a  Soviet   quantity  weighted  dollar/ruble  ppp  of   2.48,&#13;
(Edwards, 1979) and divided by an annual average population&#13;
figure of 256.75 million persons.&#13;
b)  The conversion ratio for 1976 is 2.04 dollars per ruble, which&#13;
is the geometric mean of a Soviet quantity weighted and a U.S.&#13;
quantity weighted ppp. (Edwards, 1979).&#13;
c)  The conversion ratio used for 1976 is the ratio of the value of&#13;
Soviet exports in world-market prices to their domestic ruble&#13;
cost (from Table 8).&#13;
d)  The conversion ratio is the average of the dollar/ruble ratio&#13;
for Soviet exports and for Soviet imports from Table 8,&#13;
unweighted, since exports and imports were approximately equal.&#13;
In all cases the 1976 benchmark figure has been moved forward by&#13;
multiplying by CIA index of real GNP growth, (from JEC, 1982) and&#13;
by the U.S. GNP price index, and by dividing by the index of Soviet&#13;
average annual population growth (from Nar Khoz).      These indexes&#13;
are summarized below.&#13;

            The conversion of national income data of
            the U.S.S.R. to concepts of the system of national accounts
            in dollars and estimation of growth rate
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper develops estimates of Soviet
            gross national product (GNP) in rubles for the 1970s and in
            dollars for selected years in the 1970s. The paper also
            considers alternative ways for converting the GNP estimates
            in rubles to U.S. dollars, and suggests the use of
            purchasing power parity ratio. Finally, the paper discusses
            various measures of output growth in the USSR, and concludes
            that the official indexes for growth of net material product
            exaggerate the rate of growth of aggregate output.
