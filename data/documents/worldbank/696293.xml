1. THE SECTOR&#13;
1.1    With a 1995 per capita income of US$230 per annum, Bangladesh is among the poorest&#13;
countries in the world. About half the people are below the poverty line, with over 80% in the rural&#13;
areas (Annex 1). The poverty situation has deteriorated in the last decade, primarily due to the rapid&#13;
increase of the working age population, increasing landlessness, and slow growth in productive non-&#13;
farm employment. The burden of poverty falls disproportionately on women, who on average had&#13;
88% of nutritional intake of males and 40% of the wage rate earned by males; also declining homestead&#13;
based activities have exposed women to serious economic pressures.&#13;
1.2    The present production structure, accompanied by sound macro-economic and incentive&#13;
policies can help increase GDP growth rate above 5 %; but even this will be insufficient to productively&#13;
employ all new entrants to the labor force. Robust growth in agriculture could probably absorb about&#13;
25 % of new entrants, and industry and services another 40%. The remainder would have no choice&#13;
but to turn to the rural non-farm (RNF) sector for employment opportunities and involve themselves in&#13;
marginal activities; this would swell the ranks of the very poor, unless action is taken to diversify the&#13;
rural economy and expand targeted efforts to help the landless. However, the ability of the landless to&#13;
engage in productive non-farm employment is severely limited by their illiteracy, lack of skills and&#13;
inadequate financial resources.&#13;
1.3    Poverty alleviation and rural employment are top priorities in the development agenda of&#13;
Government of Bangladesh (GOB). The GOB has adopted a broad based approach to poverty&#13;
alleviation, that emphasizes macroeconomic stability and economic liberalization, and supports a&#13;
number of targeted programs. It has also assigned top priority to increasing foodgrain production, and&#13;
more recently to developing labor-intensive export industries in order to increase employment and&#13;
incomes. A salient feature of many such targeted programs is the provision of microcredit for self-&#13;
employment, by a number of government agencies as well as by various non-government organizations&#13;
(NGOs). In most instances good progress has been made in implementing these microcredit schemes,&#13;
and the scope for efficient expansion is enormous. The proposed Project is the result of a participatory&#13;
initiative between GOB, IDA and the NGOs, and is based on detailed studies and reviews of successful&#13;
poverty-oriented microfinance programs.&#13;

2. FINANCE AND THE POOR&#13;
Overview&#13;
2.1    Bangladesh's financial sector comprises the formal financial institutions (15 commercial and&#13;
specialized banks, and two cooperative networks), the semi-formal institutions (over 150 NGO-based&#13;
microfinance institutions), and the informal institutions (family, friends and money lenders). For the&#13;
most part, these institutions have operated in segmented markets. The informal sector dominates rural&#13;
finance in Bangladesh, with the semi-formal sector occupying second place and the formal sector third.&#13;
In FY94, Grameen Bank and other NGO-based Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) provided about Tk 17&#13;
billion in microcredit, compared with Tk 11 billion of rural credit provided by the agricultural banks&#13;
and nationalized commercial banks (NCBs) combined. Table 2.1 below provides estimates of&#13;
microcredit disbursements, in recent years, by the different institutions.&#13;

The Formal Financial Sector&#13;
2.2    This comprises the public sector financial institutions (NCBs and specialized banks), private&#13;
banks and the Grameen Bank. Apart from the latter, few other institutions in the formal sector have&#13;
been a major source of microfinance. Although the NCBs and specialized banks have a large rural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
credit program and some have initiated microcredit programs, for the most part their rural credit&#13;
programs are neither targeted to the poor nor do they reach the poor. Their programs are mainly for&#13;
small rural enterprises and farmers, rarely include the landless, and their average microcredit loan size&#13;
is 3-5 times that of MFIs. Also, when NCBs have provided microcredit. their rather low lending rates&#13;
of 16% compared to MFIs' rates to the final borrower (para 3.4) suggests that these banks are making&#13;
such loans perhaps to fulfill their social obligations and provide work for underutilized staff in rural&#13;
branches. While they have high collection rates (90% +) on their microcredit portfolios, overall the&#13;
portfolio quality of these institutions has been very unsatisfactory because of pervasive "default&#13;
culture"; a recent World Bank study indicates that non-performing loans (according to international&#13;
standards) are over 50 % of the total portfolio. Private banks have largely stayed away from the rural&#13;
credit sector, due to the high cost of intermediation and perceived risk.&#13;
2.3    Several factors militate against lending by commercial banks to MFIs or directly to the poor;&#13;
these include the predilection of commercial banks to shy away from the asset-less, and their operating&#13;
culture and procedures which are geared to the relatively well off, well connected and more vocal&#13;
segments of rural society. While there are no regulatory or interest rate barriers to voluntary lending,&#13;
getting commercial banks involved in MFI financing would require the "heavy hand' of government, in&#13;
addition to offering credit guarantees.' The banking sector would also have to undergo a sea-change to&#13;
lend on an uncollateralized basis, given that collateralized lending is the norm; in the interim it would&#13;
require forcing banks to relax their collateral requirements which would be imprudent in the present&#13;
environment of "default culture". Commercial banks, thus, are unlikely to become a major player in&#13;
microfinance in the foreseeable future.&#13;
2.4    The most important and internationally well-known example of a formal sector institution&#13;
providing microfinance is the Grameen Bank. It began as an NGO, but was formally established as a&#13;
specialized bank under a special charter in 1983. Grameen's shareholders are its' borrowers and the&#13;
Government. It is the largest provider of microcredit in Bangladesh and has so far disbursed about Tk&#13;
48 billion to around 2 million poor.&#13;
The Semi-Formal Sector&#13;
2.5    The semi-formal sector comprises largely NGOs which operate microfinance programs targeted&#13;
to the rural poor. There are over 150 NGOs in Bangladesh offering regular financial services-&#13;
microcredit and savings, and majority of these programs are less than 5 years old. Most of these NGO-&#13;
based MFIs are social welfare non-profit organizations formed to provide nonlending services such as&#13;
social empowerment, education, family planning, relief, sanitation, and health. Recognizing the&#13;
importance of stable income and capital accumulation for a permanent escape from poverty, these&#13;
NGOs initiated targeted savings and credit programs for income generating self-employment activities.&#13;
Over time, these institutions also recognized that provision of nonlending services was not, in itself,&#13;
leading to alleviation of poverty and that lending and nonlending services sustain and reinforce each&#13;
other. MFIs see financial services as a vehicle to achieve multiple objectives: enhance the poor's&#13;
consumption; empower them to access health and education services; as a social safety net for the very&#13;
poor; and as a means to establish a permanent income-generating asset base for the poor. These&#13;
programs have grown rapidly and are a major source of finance for the poor (Annex 2). During the&#13;
last five years, these MFIs have disbursed, on a cumulative basis, about Tk II billion to over 2.5&#13;
In early 1995, through moral suasion, GOB made NCBs buy Tk 6 billion of Grameen Bank bonds. These&#13;
were underwritten by GOB and were also eligible securities to meet statutory liquidity requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
million borrowers. 80% of credit recipients are women and repayment rates are mostly above 95%;&#13;
this is a stark comparison to the pervasive loan "default culture" in the formal system. In addition to&#13;
the NGO-based MFIs, the Bangladesh Rural Development Board (BRDB) has a well performing&#13;
microcredit program financed by external donors.&#13;
2.6    The microfinance market structure is bipolar; almost 95% of the market is serviced by&#13;
Grameen Bank and a few large national MFIs, such as BRAC, ASA, and Proshika, with annual credit&#13;
programs ranging from Tk 0.4-2.0 billion. These institutions are professionally managed and staffed,&#13;
and have so far received a majority of their funds as grant from overseas donors. The large MFIs&#13;
operate on the basis of 3-5 year business plans, which are fully funded at commencement of the plan.&#13;
The remaining 5% share of the market is serviced by small, local MFIs with annual credit programs&#13;
ranging from Tk 1-100 million. They have flexible organizational structures and have grown according&#13;
to the availability of funds; most of these rely on PKSF (para 2.7) for financial support. Despite the&#13;
bipolar market structure, there is increasing competition among service providers as the number of&#13;
institutions increase. With some of the large MFIs (e.g. Grameen and BRAC) slowing down their&#13;
expansion in new areas, the small/medium MFIs are expected to become the major institutions for&#13;
increasing outreach in areas not covered currently.&#13;
The Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation (PKSF)&#13;
2.7    A major institutional innovation in Bangladesh was the establishment in FY90 of the Palli&#13;
Karma Sahayak Foundation (PKSF), an apex financing institution to assist promising small and medium&#13;
NGOs expand their poverty targeted microcredit programs. Detailed institutional and financial analysis&#13;
of PKSF is given in Annex 3. The PKSF is registered under the Companies Act of 1913 as a private&#13;
non-profit organization. It has a General Body of 15 people, of which majority are from outside the&#13;
Government and are leading personalities and social workers of national and international repute. The&#13;
General Body, which meets a few times a year, provides broad policy direction. In addition, there is a&#13;
seven member Governing Body, comprising the Chairman, Managing Director and five other&#13;
members. The Governing Body meets more frequently and is responsible for overall policies and&#13;
operations (including loan approvals). The Chairman and two other members are appointed by the&#13;
Government; the former, however, cannot be a serving official. In the past the Managing Director was&#13;
appointed by the Government, but in late-1995 PKSF's Articles of Association were changed to give&#13;
this authority to PKSF's Governing Body. The other three Board members are selected by the General&#13;
Body from private sector, and represent knowledge professionals with interest in the field of NGO&#13;
activities and poverty alleviation. The Governing Body currently includes Professor Yunus of Grameen&#13;
Bank.&#13;
2.8    PKSF's Governing Body has full autonomy on staff compensation and recruitment/termination.&#13;
PKSF's salaries are higher than those of government and large national NGOs. Importantly, it has&#13;
rigorous staff selection criteria-professional staff must have masters degree with above average grades&#13;
(i.e., First Class). It has a staff of 72 of whom 37 are professional staff.&#13;
2.9    As of December 1995, PKSF has financed 124 Partner Organizations (POs)2, almost all of&#13;
which started as social service organizations, adding microcredit subsequently as a new service to their&#13;
nonlending activities. PKSF proactively solicits new POs but maintains tight entry standards as&#13;
2   PKSF uses the term "Partner Organization" (PO) for MFIs borrowing from PKSF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
reflected by its very high rejection rate-of the 690 NGOs who have applied for loans, PKSF has&#13;
approved only 124. To be eligible to borrow from PKSF., POs are required to have a demonstrated&#13;
track record of microfinance or a potential capacity; while PKSF does not exclude POs with newly&#13;
established credit activities, it gives priority to those with on-going programs. Thus of the 18 new POs&#13;
it accepted in FY95, 15 had been operating a credit/savings program for over 2 years. while all the&#13;
remainder had credit operation for one year. So far, PO's borrowing from PKSF have mnobilized 1.2&#13;
mnillion poor women into groups; however, only 25% of these have been provided microcredit because&#13;
offinding shortages and cautious lending policies.&#13;
2.10   PKSF makes uncollateralized fixed-rate loans, at rates ranging from 3-4.5% p.a.. with a&#13;
maturity period of three years. It periodically reviews its rate structure and raised rates by 0.5-1.0% in&#13;
end-1994. Even though POs need long-term funds (para 3.8), PKSF provides three-year loans to&#13;
ensure adequate accountability and monitoring of fund use: at the same time, it has a policy of&#13;
automatically providing repeater loans of higher amounts, as long as the repayment rate is satisfactory&#13;
(i.e. 95% +) and PO continues to have good manag.ment.&#13;
2.11   PKSF's overall operating policies and procedures are quite satisfactory. Its credit approval&#13;
policies are sound and conservative, credit supervision intensive, accounting/MIS systems reasonably&#13;
satisfactory and its own external audit quite comprehensive. PKSF's main focus of attention with&#13;
regard to its POs is on loan collections (which have been over 99.8% since inception), satisfactory&#13;
bookkeeping of disbursements and repayments, routing of PKSF-financed transactions through banks.&#13;
and ensuring that microcredits are made to the target group. POs are required to conduct all&#13;
transactions of PKSF-funded programs through banks and submit monthly bank statements and MIS&#13;
reports. Loans are approved on the basis of POs' annual needs, but disbursed generally at intervals of&#13;
1-2 months after field supervision and bank statements confirm that the earlier tranche has been&#13;
satisfactorily used. To further strengthen its monitoring and internal accountability capabilities, PKSF&#13;
has recently established an Internal Audit Cell which would undertake compliance audit of each PO&#13;
twice a year.&#13;
2.12   PKSF has established a prudent exposure limit; maximum loan to a PO generally canlot exceed&#13;
10% of available funds. In addition, it follows a conservative policy for first-time POs by starting with&#13;
a small loan and gradually increasing loan sizes. For example, in regard to the 18 POs approved in&#13;
FY95, the loan size ranged from Tk 100,000 (for 12 POs) to Tk 1.2 million. As of June 1995. the&#13;
average loan outstanding per PO amounted to about Tk 24 million, while the size distribution was as&#13;
follows: 57% of loans, by number, were below Tk 2 million, 34% between Tk 2-5 million and&#13;
remainder 9% higher. Loans in the last category accounted for 60% of outstandilng loans with the&#13;
maximum loan outstanding being Tk 80 million.&#13;
2.13   PKSF encourages its POs to at least fully cover the recurring credit administrative/fundinig&#13;
costs from interest income; it also imposes a minimum lending rate of 16% to ensure that POs do not&#13;
lend below commercial bank rates and to promote cost recovery from operations. PKSF also&#13;
encourages POs who have outside sources of income to set aside a portion of interest income as&#13;
reserves. PKSF mandates that all POs must have a member savings program and generally requires&#13;
that these savings be kept in a regular bank; only for those POs which have a good track record and&#13;
high standards of financial accounting does PKSF allow them to use savings in credit programs. It&#13;
follows this strict policy to protect savings of the poor. In general, it does not impose any specific&#13;
performance or sustainability target. PKSF's main objective is to ensure accountability of its funds and&#13;
member savings. As long as POs meet its stringent requirements for targeted lending, repayment and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
accounting, PKSF neither monitors nor imposes its view on: (a) PO's product mix; (b) cross-&#13;
subsidization of nonlending services from lending profits or lending services from grants and other&#13;
income: (c) loan pricing and loan loss reserve policies; (d) level of mandatory savings; and (e)&#13;
separation of accounts for different services, etc. Considering the pervasive loan default culture, the&#13;
higlh priority PKSF attaches to loan collections is well-placed and should remain as its predominant&#13;
concern. In addition, but without sacrificing the above noted emphasis. it needs to pay attention to&#13;
issues of sustainability and its own role as an apex financial institution. Thus, a major institutional&#13;
developmenit objective of the Project is to enhance PKSF's financial planning and monitoring&#13;
capabilities, incorporate forward looking performance targets in PKSF's credit policies, and strengthen&#13;
field-level financial accountability including accounting/auditing standards of POs.&#13;
2.14   PKSF has so far been fully funded on a grant basis by GOB, which has provided it with Tk 750&#13;
million: of this, over half was provided a year ago. PKSF's annual disbursement increased from Tk 3&#13;
million in FY 90, to an estimated Tk 500 million in FY 96. PKSF's assets increased from Tk 239&#13;
million in 1991 to Tk 844 million as of June 30, 1995. Loans outstanding increased during the same&#13;
period from Tk 3 million to Tk 456 million, or about 55% of assets. The remaining 45% of assets are&#13;
mostly investments in term deposits which yield about 6% compared to a yield of about 3.5% on loans.&#13;
With expansion of loan portfolio. PKSF's operating costs, as % of loans, declined from 10% in FY93&#13;
to 2.7% in FY95. Since inception, PKSF has been profitable, mostly on account of interest income&#13;
from term deposits and has pursued a policy to project itself as a sustainable institution-for staff&#13;
morale and to the POs, and to avoid decapitalization. The high percentage of assets in investments is,&#13;
thus, partly a reflection of the profitability objective and partly on account of its conservative lending&#13;
policies. While this policy has obviously led to sacrificing the poverty objective, i.e. higher lending,&#13;
for the reasons noted earlier it seems appropriate. With the profitability objective now well ensured,&#13;
the share of loans in assets is expected to increase to 80% in five years (Table 6.1). Beginning FY96,&#13;
PKSF intends to start making loan loss provisions amounting to I % of annual disbursements; with close&#13;
to 100% recovery rate, this level of provisions appears satisfactory. However, with the impending&#13;
expansion, and associated potential risks, PKSF needs to adopt a provisions policy appropriate for its&#13;
contingent risks; a new policy wouid be developed under the Project (para 4.33).&#13;
2.?15   Overall, PKSF's independent and autonomous governance structure and prudent operating&#13;
policies provide a good foundation for rapid and sustainable expansion of its lending to POs. It has&#13;
nurtured over 120 MFIs whose financial service programs have good potential for becoming financially&#13;
viable, and as a result significantly increased access of the poor and competition among MFIs.&#13;
3. MICROFINANCE PROGRAMS AND INSTITUTIONS&#13;
3.1    All MFIs are multipurpose, providing both credit and non-credit services. Not only there is a&#13;
wide range in the scope of services offered by each MFI, but there is also large variation in the&#13;
microcredit programs pursued by each. While the key operational and financial features of the credit&#13;
programs are similar and credit is usually multi-dimensional (i.e., combined with skills development,&#13;
marketing assistance, etc.), MFIs operate with differing objectives, methodologies and scope of multi-&#13;
dimensionality in credit. At one end of the spectrum there are institutions like Grameen Bank and&#13;
ASA, where credit activities dominate the institutions' business. At the other end are MFIs like BRAC&#13;
and Proshika, which believe that an integrated strategy focused on community and human resource&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
development is necessary to assist the landless; for these institutions credit is only about half of their&#13;
activities with the remaining accounted for by social sector programs, livestock/fisheries, social&#13;
forestry, social empowerment, etc. Institutions at both ends of the spectrum have experienced&#13;
tremendous success in terms of horizontal (i.e., new borrowers) and vertical outreach (i.e. larger loan&#13;
size) and repayment performance, though the MFIs which are "credit-only" and whose credit has&#13;
fewer multi-dimensional elements have lower operating costs.&#13;
WHO ARE THE BORROWERS?&#13;
The target group includes:&#13;
I .    Landless women such as Bedana, age 35, who initially received Tk 1,000 to purchase goats and chickens.&#13;
This enabled her to improve her four children's diet, and earn some income from the sale of eggs and chicken. In the&#13;
following years, she received larger loans, and was able to purchase and operate a small grocery shop. A&#13;
development education class taught her basic skills in math, and also increased her awareness of the impact of health,&#13;
nutrition, and the environment on her family's well-being.&#13;
2.      It also includes women such as Sokhina, age 27, whose family lost everything in the 1988 floods. An initial&#13;
loan of Tk 500 helped her family survive and resume their business of paddy husking. The family also purchased a&#13;
goat for fattening, and profits from its sale and from paddy husking enabled Sokhina's husband to buy a rickshaw,&#13;
and further increase the family's sources of livelihood. A second loan of Tk 1,000 helped Sokhina start a mat&#13;
business. Finally, a Tk 3,000 loan, combined with Sokhina's personal savings, allowed the family to purchase land,&#13;
which was used for jute-cropping.&#13;
3.     Often, the recipients of these loans are poor, young widows. Such was the case of Rahima Begum, age 31.&#13;
After her husband's death, Rahima learned sewing in an effort to sustain herself, but was unable to get credit to&#13;
purchase a sewing machine. An initial loan of Tk 1,000, combined with personal savings, permitted her to buy a&#13;
basic sewing machine. She began a tailoring business, which gradually expanded. With a further loan of Tk 2,000,&#13;
Rahima bought another sewing machine and employed an assistant. Profits from the business financed much needed&#13;
repairs in the house and Rahima's tailoring business is now worth Tk 6,000.&#13;

Operational Features&#13;
3.2    The MFIs' credit model has the following key features : (a) it is targeted to the landless/asset-&#13;
less; (b) all borrowers have to be part of a group, and groups meet regularly once a week; (c) women&#13;
borrowers are given preference. In fact, most MFIs only lend to women, and overall women&#13;
borrowers make up over 80% of the total borrowers; (d) loans are collateral-free, and generally have a&#13;
maturity of 50 weeks with weekly repayments; (e) savings is an integral part of the program; (f)&#13;
borrowers have full freedom to choose the activity to be financed by the loan; (g) all financial&#13;
transactions are recorded in individual passbooks and done in presence of the entire group to enhance&#13;
transparency and self-monitoring; (h) all MFIs start with a small loan (Tk 1-3 thousand) and provide&#13;
repeater loans of increasing amounts as long as repayment of earlier loan is satisfactory. This repeater&#13;
feature is critical to the excellent repayment performance, but more importantly the basic premise is&#13;
that the poor need to have continuous access to credit, in increasing amount, for 8-10 years to&#13;
accumulate enough savings/assets (net of debt) to escape from the poverty trap and maintain reasonable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
consumption once loan is withdrawn; (i) most MFIs have maximum loan limits of Tk 8-12 thousand.&#13;
but few have a policy to "graduate" a borrower from the program since borrowers with large loans are&#13;
low risk-having been in the system for several years-and provide ability for cross-subsidy (para 3.4);&#13;
() most of the credit provided by MFIs finances rural non-farm production. This includes activities&#13;
such as poultry farming, petty trade and shopkeeping, cow fattening, pottery, and other related&#13;
activities-mainly activities with short gestation and daily sales; and, (k) MFIs use fairly comprehensive&#13;
loan forms to select beneficiaries. In the absence of land records and objective means test, the selection&#13;
is largely subjective. However the following features of the program provide a reasonable degree of&#13;
assurance that only the poor get the loans: self-selection process; very small loan sizes and high&#13;
interest rates; rigorous enforcement of repayment; weekly meetings; MFI staff's knowledge of local&#13;
commllunities and unlikelihood of the better-off to subject themselves to the rigors of the program and&#13;
be seen sitting with the poor in open meetings.&#13;
Financial Aspects&#13;
3.3    Following from their overriding poverty and social welfare objectives, most institutions operate&#13;
on a non-profit basis and emphasize increasing borrowers' incomes rather than making profits. Within&#13;
the constraints imposed by the resource envelope comprising grants, concessional funds and voluntary&#13;
services of key organizers, MFIs' attempt to maximize nonlending services and horizontal outreach,&#13;
minimize interest rates, and pursue a loosely defined goal of achieving financial sustainability on their&#13;
credit programs. There is wide variation among MFIs on the relative priority attached to each of these&#13;
objectives. The usual pattern is described below.&#13;
3.4    Iiiterest rates. These are much higher than rates in the formal sector. Effective interest rates&#13;
range from 25-30%3 per annum; this is 15-20% in real terms and 50-100% higher than the highest&#13;
lending rates of private banks. Interest rates are set such that within 3-5 years of initiating lending to a&#13;
group, interest revenues from each group fully cover the operating costs (administrative costs, interest&#13;
cost on borrowed funds and borrower savings, and 2-3% loan loss provisions). By this time average&#13;
loans are around Tk 5-6 thousand and 80-90% of the group members are borrowing. Beyond this&#13;
point, and as loan sizes increase, interest income exceed costs which enables the MFI to cross subsidize&#13;
new groups. MFIs charge a uniform rate for all borrowers which allows them to cross-subsidize loss-&#13;
making first time borrowers through profits originating from mature borrowers who have been in the&#13;
system for several years and whose loan size is generally 2-3 times that of a first time borrower. The&#13;
availability of low-cost funds enhances the ability for cross-subsidization, and hence horizontal&#13;
outreach. While loan pricing is generally on a cost-plus basis, the interest rates fall within the above&#13;
band because of: (a) pricing policies of market leaders like Grameen/BRAC; (b) "social consensus" on&#13;
this rate band; (c) MFIs' poverty objectives and reluctance to charge higher interest rates which they&#13;
consider usurious; and (d) increasing competition and a growing pattern of beneficiaries switching&#13;
between MFIs. This latter behavior has also put pressure on MFIs to enhance cost effectiveness.&#13;
3.5    Credit Delivery Costs. These usually range from 10-20% of loan amount, and vary&#13;
considerably; for example, per borrower, they are annually Tk 330 (Grameen), Tk 400 (Proshika). Tk&#13;
Most institutions charge a nominal rate of 12-15% with interest due calculated on the basis that the principal&#13;
amount is outstanding for the entire 50 week period; e.g., at an interest rate of 12%, interest collected on a&#13;
loan of Tk 100 would be Tk 12, even though because of weekly repayments, average loan outstanding is&#13;
around Tk. 50. Because of this feature and other fees (e.g. emergency fund, etc.), the effective interest rate&#13;
amounts to around 25-30%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
380 (BRAC) and Tk 240 (ASA). They are higher for smaller MFIs and whose credit is more multi-&#13;
dimensional and lower for larger MFIs and those which provide limited nonlending services as part of&#13;
credit; also they decline over time with increase in volume of lending.&#13;
3.6    Credit Risk Management. Most MFIs incorporate a 2-3 % loan loss provision in their&#13;
interest rate. Many also operate mandatory credit insurance schemes to enable borrowers to repay&#13;
loans in case of natural disasters, death, sickness, etc. The grants and the mandatory savings also&#13;
provide MFIs adequate cushion to absorb credit risks over and above the 2-3 % provisions.&#13;
3.7    Funding Strategy. The MFI's strategy has been to seek low cost and long term funds. Rough&#13;
estimates indicate that grants, concessional loans and borrower savings account for 37, 30 and 33 %&#13;
respectively, of the MFIs' total funding base at end-1994. MFIs basically act as "pass-through"&#13;
institutions in terms of the benefits of the lower cost funds.&#13;
3.8    MFIs prefer grants (or interest-only borrowings) rather than borrowings which require regular&#13;
principal repayments, as this enables them to pursue an important feature of the program-assured&#13;
repeater loans-without fear of a break in the cycle. Prior to a situation where all of MFIs' borrowers&#13;
have completed the 8-10 year cycle (para 3.2), withdrawal of funds from the MFIs in form of principal&#13;
repayment would necessitate withdrawal of an equivalent amount from the final beneficiary-this would&#13;
break the virtuous cycle of higher consumption/savings accumulation and push the poor back into&#13;
poverty. Moreover, withdrawal of principal would also diminish MFIs' capacity to increase outreach.&#13;
3.9    The use of borrower savings by the MFIs falls into two categories. Those MFIs (e.g. Grameen&#13;
and ASA) which tend to emphasize lending services use borrower savings for this purpose and pay&#13;
deposit rates equal to rates on savings accounts at NCBs; borrowers are not allowed to withdraw&#13;
savings until their loans are fully paid. Other MFIs, such as Proshika, do not use borrower savings for&#13;
credit, though they mandate that borrowers regularly save and monitor savings which are kept by the&#13;
borrowers in a bank. PKSF's POs are required to follow this latter policy (para 2.13). Although&#13;
accurate data is not available, there is a definite pattern for the savings mobilized by MFIs. As MFIs&#13;
begin operations, savings are quite high as proportion of loans outstanding and range from 40 to 60%.&#13;
With credit expansion this ratio drops to around 15-20%, and then starts to increase as voluntary&#13;
savings increase for borrowers who have been in the system for several years. For mature MFIs, like&#13;
Grameen, savings are about 30% of loans outstanding.&#13;
3.10   So far retained earnings have not been a major source of funding. MFIs prefer to maximize&#13;
borrower income rather than build up equity and believe that until the time their horizontal outreach&#13;
objectives are met, and mature borrowers exceed new first time borrowers, they would not have the&#13;
ability to build up equity from operations.&#13;
3.11   Determinants of Viability and Sustainability. Table 3.1 on the next page highlights for a&#13;
range of MFIs, key operational information and the MFIs' financial evolution with respect to the&#13;
following three broad viability indicators: (a) operational viability , i.e. interest income exceeds&#13;
administrative costs; (b) financial viability, i.e. interest income exceeds administrative, loan loss and&#13;
subsidized financial costs; and (c) economic viability, i.e. interest income exceeds administrative, loan&#13;
loss and market-priced financial costs. Because of the lack of good accounting information separating&#13;
costs of lending and nonlending services, and unaudited financial statements of small/medium MFIs,&#13;
Table 3.1 is, at best, rudimentary and indicative&#13;

Source:  MFIs and staff estimates.  Figures in parenthesis are Subsidy Dependency Index (SDI) for 1994&#13;
estimated by another study. An SDI of 1.0 implies that interest rates would have to increase by 100% to eliminate&#13;
all forms of subsidy.&#13;
3.12   From the above table, the general pattern that emerges is that as loan portfolio increases,&#13;
financial viability improves and dependence on external funds declines while economic subsidy&#13;
prevails. Thus, in case of Grameen, financial viability indicator was 98% in 1994, having increased&#13;
from 88% in 1992. Similarly, in case of Proshika, the financial viability indicator increased from 61 %&#13;
in 1992 to 74% in 1994. The "mostly credit" institutions (e.g., Grameen, ASA) are financially viable,&#13;
4   Interest Income as % of non-financial operating costs (total non-financial costs for "mostly-credit" MFIs and&#13;
estimated credit-related costs for "multi-purpose" MFIs).&#13;
5   Interest Income as % of operating cost including financial expenses.&#13;
6   Interest Income as % of operating cost plus imputed economic cost (10% p.a.) of entire funding base&#13;
comprising grant funds, concessional loans, and borrower savings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
albeit on the basis of subsidized funding; on the other hand, the multipurpose institutions (e.g.,&#13;
Proshika) are loss making on account of their emphasis on horizontal outreach and greater multi-&#13;
dimensionality in their credit program. Few of the institutions would be profitable if opportunity cost&#13;
was imputed to grants/ concessional funds; thus, in 1994, interest income as percentage of economic&#13;
costs was 75% (Grameen), 102% (ASA), 41% (Proshika), and 72% (BRAC).&#13;
3.13   Overall, most MFIs currently operate at or below operational viability stage because they are of&#13;
recent origin (para 2.5); very few are economically viable. They use grants from donors and income&#13;
from commercial activities (e.g. fish ponds, handicrafts) for providing nonlending services, financing&#13;
up-front costs of establishing new groups and initial losses incurred until the lending volume builds up&#13;
to a break-even level. The time frame for an MFI to move from one viability stage to the next&#13;
depends on the following factors, many of which result from development choices made by MFIs:&#13;
*  Volume of lending, with viability improving as the portfolio expands.&#13;
*  Unit loan size, per beneficiary, is also a critical determinant. Those MFIs which emphasize&#13;
vertical outreach tend to move faster along the viability continuum compared to those that&#13;
emphasize horizontal outreach. MFIs optimize this trade-off (Annex 2, para 22) based on&#13;
availability of grant/own funds to cover losses. In general, for a typical MFI having multi-&#13;
dimensional credit and operating cost (para 3.5) like Grameen, it appears that the MFI&#13;
attains operational, financial, and economic viability once unit loan reaches Tk 3-5&#13;
thousand, Tk 4-6 thousand, and Tk 7-9 thousand respectively.&#13;
-  Scope of multi-dimensionality of credit and other nonlending services provided has a&#13;
direct impact on viability. MFIs whose credit does not include non-lending services (e.g.,&#13;
ASA) has much better ratios than MFIs whose credit is more multi-dimensional (e.g.,&#13;
Grameen). Similarly "mostly credit" MFIs (e.g., Grameen and ASA) have higher viability&#13;
ratios compared to multi-purpose MFIs (e.g., BRAC and Proshika).&#13;
-  Wage level of staff is an important determinant of operating costs. Wages paid by small&#13;
MFIs are much lower than large MFIs like Grameen or BRAC. As MFIs' lending volume&#13;
increases, wage costs (as % of loans) decrease; beyond a certain scale the wage costs start&#13;
to increase as they have to compete with the large MFIs for better qualified staff.&#13;
* Standardization of products. Those MFIs, like ASA, which follow rigid product&#13;
standardization-all loans in multiples of Tk 1000 and savings in multiples of Tk 5-have&#13;
lower administrative costs compared to those which offer borrowers a choice.&#13;
*  Percentage of group members borrowing. MFIs which are able to finance a high&#13;
percentage of group members have lower unit costs.&#13;
Institutional Capacity&#13;
3.14   So far institutional capacity has not been a constraint to lending, as evidenced by the rapid&#13;
horizontal and vertical expansion of these programs without any adverse effect on repayment. The&#13;
large/medium MFIs, in particular those which have had generous access to funds have been able to&#13;
expand rapidly due to the simplicity of the system, tried and tested credit model and the large pool of&#13;
unemployed college graduates available to work at the field level. Thus, over the last five years, each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
of the large institutions-BRAC, Grameen, ASA and Proshika-have expanded their programs five&#13;
times (Table 2.1). PKSF's POs have experienced even higher growth rates. Most MFIs are dependent&#13;
on dynamism of original organizer and lack depth of management. Evidence indicates that over time&#13;
institutional viability improves-there is well developed organization and professional management.&#13;
Accounting and Auditing&#13;
3.15   The accounting, MIS and external audit policies and standards followed by the large MFIs,&#13;
particularly those funded by external donors, are good and comprehensive. While PKSF monitors very&#13;
closely the credit programs of small/medium MFIs financed by it. for the most part the latter's&#13;
accounting, MIS and audit systems need to be substantially upgraded. MFIs can, to some degree,&#13;
separate cost of credit delivery from costs of nonlending services; few have a cost allocation system&#13;
which accurately tracks these costs or is able to differentiate the direct cost of credit delivery from&#13;
associated costs, i.e., group mobilization, training, empowerment, etc. An important objective to be&#13;
pursued under the Project is improving the financial and cost-accounting systems, while recognizing the&#13;
genuine concerns of MFIs about the administrative/reporting burdens of even a rudimentary cost&#13;
accounting system.&#13;
Socioeconomic Impact&#13;
3.16   There have been several studies to measure the impact of microfinance on the socioeconomic&#13;
status of the beneficiaries (Annex 4). The quality, coverage, independence and analytical robustness of&#13;
these vary considerably. Most however, do indicate that households which received microcredit have&#13;
better living standards, higher human development status and greater assets. A more rigorous study by&#13;
Bank staff shows that MFIs place their programs in poorer areas and that program participation among&#13;
the poor is self-selective. The study also shows that microfinance programs, such as those of Grameen&#13;
Bank, have desirable impact on the poor, program impact is statistically different for male and female&#13;
borrowers, women benefit from program participation, and the larger the loan the more significant the&#13;
socioeconomic impact.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
3500; a 1 % increase in their loan size would: (a) increase per capita consumption (a weekly increase&#13;
of 4.3 % among female borrowers and 1.8 % increase among male borrowers); (b) enhance school&#13;
participation rate for boys (7.2 % increase among male borrowers and 6. 1 % increase among female&#13;
borrowers) and girls (3.0 % increase among male borrowers and 4.7 % increase among female&#13;
borrowers); and (c) reduce recent (over the last five years) fertility of women aged 15-49 (7.4 %&#13;
reduction for male borrowing and 3.5 % reduction for fema!e borrowing).&#13;
3.18   The Bank study also indicates that: (a) earnings, from microcredit, of an average female&#13;
borrower of Grameen Bank can take the family out of poverty (i.e. per capita consumption exceeds&#13;
poverty level consumption) within five years of continuous borrowing; (b) the total assets of a borrower&#13;
are about 140- 240% higher in 4 years compared to asset holding prior to participation in the program;&#13;
(c) women benefit from program participation mainly through increasing labor supply to cash-income&#13;
earning activities (by 10.4%) and holding more nonland assets (by 19.9%); (d) these programs have&#13;
created positive externality in the village economy. The nonfarm income of an average household is&#13;
14.8 % higher in Grameen Bank villages than nonprogram villages, with a resulting 10.2% increase of&#13;
average household total annual income; (e) rural wage workers also benefit from program placement.&#13;
The average daily wage rate is at least 5.2% higher in Grameen Bank villages than in non-program&#13;
villages: and (f) the credit programs have generated positive externality in the case of both informal&#13;
lendinig (reduction of 54.5%) and informal interest rate (a reduction of 8.0%).&#13;
3.19   Due to the MFIs' active involvement in social issues, differentiating the impact of credit versus&#13;
the impact of other nonlending services that they provide is difficult. According to one study, as much&#13;
as 75 % of the increase in income can be attributed to nonlending services7. However, it is important to&#13;
recognize that the credit and non-credit activities are an integral part of a development paradigm&#13;
focused on poverty alleviation and that microfinance programs should not be viewed in isolation merely&#13;
as a financial intermediation activity. In comparison to other targeted programs in Bangladesh for&#13;
poverty alleviation (e.g., Food-for-Work, etc.) experience is gradually revealing that microfinance&#13;
offers much greater potential for poverty reduction as it has a proven track record, is the most&#13;
transparent method of reaching the poor, especially rural women, and results in positive externalities at&#13;
the village level.&#13;
3.20   Despite the positive contributions of these programs at the individual, group and village levels,&#13;
the enormous magnitude of poverty in Bangladesh has dwarfed this contribution in aggregate statistics.&#13;
With only a low percentage of the poor being covered so far under these programs, the highly positive&#13;
impact has not led to a drop in aggregate levels of the poor. Also, the impact has been masked by the&#13;
increase in the ranks of the poor. Any meaningful and observable change would require both a&#13;
quantum increase in the size of these programs and higher growth of the rural economy, and overall&#13;
economic growth.&#13;
Constraints to Expansion of MFI's Financial Services&#13;
3.21   The potential demand for credit is enormous (para 4. 11). The main constraint facing MFIs in&#13;
expanding outreach and attaining economic viability is funds, particularly concessional funds. As&#13;
external grant funds shrink, even large MFIs like BRAC and Proshika with strong connections to&#13;
external donors face funding constraints. While the large MFIs have developed their credit&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
management, monitoring and evaluation capabilities in tandem with their rapid expansion, the&#13;
accounting and credit management skills of smaller MFIs is weak. These institutions and PKSF need to&#13;
develop this capacity, if they are to continue expanding as they have over the last few years.&#13;
4.  THE PROJECT&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Objectives&#13;
4.1   IDA's overriding objective in Bangladesh is to support the country's efforts to accelerate the&#13;
rate and improve the pattern of growth, so as to reduce the absolute number of people living in&#13;
poverty. The CAS envisages a two pronged approach that comprises: (a) direct support for programs&#13;
which benefit the poor, and (b) programs which support overall economic growth particularly that&#13;
originating in labor-intensive economic activities. Within these themes, the CAS gives priority to&#13;
fostering the participation of the poor in the growth process, and supporting the emerging collaboration&#13;
between the Government and the NGOs. In particular, it places emphasis on increased involvement of&#13;
the communities and stakeholders in the design and monitoring of development programs.&#13;
Project Concept&#13;
4.2    The basic concept behind the Project is to enable successful MFIs to expand their financial&#13;
services programs through increasing the level of resources available to them, and to assist them in&#13;
attaining financial and institutional sustainability of these programs. Resources will be provided&#13;
through the apex intermediary, PKSF, which will onlend the funds to small, medium and large POs.&#13;
The Project was conceived by a GOB Task Force comprising key stake-holders-GOB, PKSF and&#13;
MFIs, and its design incorporates the recommendations of the Task Force and the results of a Bank&#13;
research project (RPO-676-59) under which detailed institutional and financial sustainability studies&#13;
were undertaken for three large MFIs: Grameen Bank, BRAC and BRDB's RD-12 program. The&#13;
Project design is based on a tested approach and has strong ownership features resulting from: (a) the&#13;
active involvement of key stakeholders in project preparation; (b) the high priority attached by GOB to&#13;
supporting such programs (as evidenced by its Tk 750 million grant contribution to PKSF, and&#13;
underwriting of Tk 6 billion of bonds of Grameen Bank); and (c) wide acceptance by the final&#13;
beneficiaries of the credit component's key features.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
4.3    The Project has two key objectives: (a) reduce poverty through expanding horizontal and&#13;
vertical outreach of on-going successful microfinance programs; and (b) enhance institutional and&#13;
financial sustainability of PKSF and PO's credit programs through (i) financing expansion of lending;&#13;
(ii) enhancing the role of PKSF from being a financier of small and medium POs to becoming an apex&#13;
organization that lends funds to POs of all sizes, and acts as a catalyst in mobilizing enhanced levels of&#13;
financial support from other donors and eventually from the market; (iii) assisting in institutional&#13;
strengthening of PKSF and its borrowers by providing resources for training and institution building;&#13;
(iv) providing insight and possible solutions to several issues/problems (e.g., strengthening linkages&#13;
between MFIs and the formal financial sector) currently facing the microfinance system in Bangladesh&#13;
by conducting a range of special studies and associated training; and (v) disseminating best practices for&#13;
increasing cost effectiveness of these programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
4.4    The proposed Project supports the twin CAS objectives of poverty alleviation and broad based&#13;
economic growth. Recognizing microfinance's potential as an instrument for poverty reduction, the&#13;
proposed Project is part of IDA's comprehensive poverty alleviation strategy comprising this initiative&#13;
and investments in social sectors and rural infrastructure. It will be the first of its type for IDA's&#13;
targeted assistance to the poor in Bangladesh. While the Project would benefit people from all layers of&#13;
the poverty pyramid, the majority of the clients would be rural women. The Project would thus have a&#13;
significant impact on women's economic status and empowerment, with its attendant benefits on health&#13;
and education status of children and fertility rates.&#13;
4.5    The Project is also an important element of IDA's overall strategy for the financial sector. The&#13;
overarching objective for the sector is to establish an efficient and sound financial system in order to&#13;
achieve the economic growth goals. IDA has a three pronged strategy for the sector. Thefirst is to&#13;
reform the commercial banking system which is repressed, facing enormous portfolio problem and&#13;
where loan defaulters and irresponsible bank managers/owners have so far avoided any penalties. The&#13;
key elements of the strategy involve privatization of NCBs, strengthening of regulations, and&#13;
enforcement of sanctions to overcome the "default culture" and irresponsible governance behavior.&#13;
The second is to deepen the financial system through supporting non-bank financial institutions and the&#13;
capital market, which are insignificant at present. Finally, the third is to establish a financially&#13;
sustainable market-based mechanism for provision of financial services to the poor. This would be&#13;
achieved through assisting the credit programs of the MFIs become financially sustainable and fostering&#13;
the development of linkages between the formal and informal systems. Achieving these objectives&#13;
would, of necessity, take a long time on account of: (a) the deep seated institutional problems facing&#13;
the formal financial system (para 2.3); and (b) balancing the difficult trade-off between enhancing&#13;
consumption/asset build up of the poor and removing concessionality in funding, the latter being&#13;
necessary to establish a market based microfinance system. The above not withstanding, IDA's&#13;
underlying strategy is to establish an integrated and seamless financial services market over the long&#13;
run. IDA's vision on the Project-induced evolution of the MFI sector is discussed in paras 6.13-6.17.&#13;
4.6   IDA support will also: (a) bring about a fundamental shift from a grant based system to a loan&#13;
based system. As a result of this Project, GOB has decided that all future budgetary funding to PKSF&#13;
would be in the form of loans, not grants. In addition, two large MFIs (Proshika and BRAC) would be&#13;
using loan funds for the first time; (b) enable GOB to significantly enhance its financial support to&#13;
NGO-based microcredit programs, (c) play an important institution building and dissemination role&#13;
(para 4.3); (d) assist grassroots institutions to strengthen their credit operations, as a means to sustain&#13;
and enhance nonlending services to the poor and to support those willing to move along the&#13;
organizational continuum from informal social service organizations to full service formal financial&#13;
institutions; and (e) establish an efficient mechanism to transfer subsidized funds without penalizing the&#13;
banking system. Provided Project objectives are met and achievement of outcomes is as envisaged,&#13;
IDA support for the microcredit programs is expected to continue over the foreseeable future as part of&#13;
IDA's poverty assistance strategy.&#13;
Lessons from Previous IDA/Bank Operations&#13;
4.7    This would be IDA's first microfinance operation in Bangladesh. A somewhat similar&#13;
operation in the late 1980s was aborted at negotiations after IDA was informed that PKSF's Governing&#13;
Body declined to borrow IDA funds, partly because it found IDA's conditions too onerous. At that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
time, the GOB was also not as entlhusiastic about channeling IDA funds to NGOs. Now GOB is very&#13;
keen on supporting microcredit programs in light of their success and the enormous need for funds. To&#13;
avoid a repetition of the past. and recognizing the importance of participation of key stake-holders to&#13;
successful design and ownership, PKSF and MFIs were involved in, and extensively consulted by, the&#13;
GOB Task Force and IDA. In a recent communication to IDA, the NGO Association of Development&#13;
Agencies in Bangladesh praised this Project as a "historical initiative" by IDA. The Project&#13;
incorporates the emerging lessons-importance of good credit information/supervision and emphasis on&#13;
achieving financial sustainability-of successful microfinance programs in Bangladesh and other&#13;
countries.&#13;
Coordination with Other Donors&#13;
4.8    During project preparation, IDA staff liased closely with official bilateral donors and&#13;
international NGOs who have generously supported these programs. Their views and experience have&#13;
been reflected in Project design. With grants shrinking and all donors emphasizing financial&#13;
sustainability and greater accountability, they see the Project as a path breaker in shifting microcredit&#13;
away from a grant based system and in sharpening the emphasis on financial sustainability. Since IDA&#13;
funds would be at higher cost and in form of loans, IDA would be the lender of last resort and&#13;
therefore not displace available donor funds. Moreover the continued provision of low-cost funds by&#13;
donors would not pose any problem of underutilization of Project funds given the enormity of the need.&#13;
Project Scope and Description&#13;
4.9    An IDA credit of US$105 million and GOB loan of US$10 million is to be provided under the&#13;
Project for: (a) a line of credit (US$109 million) for loans to the poor through POs that meet&#13;
predetermined criteria; and (b) technical assistance (US$6 million) for capacity and institution building&#13;
of the POs, PKSF and Bangladesh Bank (BB). The GOB loan of US$10 million and US$100 million of&#13;
IDA funds will be on-lent to PKSF on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA (para 4.17). The GOB&#13;
will provide US$5 million of IDA funds, on a grant basis, to PKSF and BB to implement the various&#13;
components for institution building and for deepening and broadening the microfinance market.&#13;
Project Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
4.10   The proposed IDA credit of US$105 million will finance 77% of the total Project cost of&#13;
US$137 million, with GOB contributing 7% (US$10 million) and POs/beneficiaries the balance of 16%&#13;
(US$22 million) . The Project costs and financing plan are summarized in Table 4.1. GOB has already&#13;
provided to PKSF its initial contribution of US$5 million.&#13;
With the inclusion of large POs and expected institutional improvements in small/mediulIl POs as a result of&#13;
the Project, it is estiniated that about S22 million of meniber savings is likely to be used for credit programs&#13;
(para 2.13).&#13;

Credit Component&#13;
Credit Size&#13;
4.11   The size of the credit component is only about 10% of the estimated potential demand for&#13;
credit. A recent study indicates that only 18% of the target group (all landless poor in the rural areas)&#13;
has been covered so far by MFIs. Bringing the remaining 82% into the program would require almost&#13;
US$1.5 billion9. Looked at another way, it would require over US$200 million to extend loans to&#13;
group members who have already been mobilized by POs borrowing from PKSF, but have not been&#13;
provided credit. The large difference in average loan size per borrower-Grameen (Tk 7500), ASA&#13;
and BRAC (Tk 2900), small POs (Tk 1500-2000)-for recipients having generally similar abilities and&#13;
market opportunities, provides an indication of the large room for credit expansion. The size of the&#13;
credit component is also much smaller than the total amount, about US$250 million, included in the&#13;
1996-2000 business plans presented to the appraisal mission by PKSF, BRAC, Proshika and ASA. On&#13;
an aggregate basis, the Project will not result in a significant increase in the availability of total funds,&#13;
given the total volume of microcredit disbursed by all institutions (US$492 million in FY95). Annex 2,&#13;
Table 1 shows the projected annual disbursements of the major MFIs between FY96 and FY2000,&#13;
roughly the period of the IDA Project. In relation to these, IDA funds will finance approximately 12%&#13;
of total annual microcredit disbursements in Bangladesh by FY2000. The Project's overall impact on&#13;
credit availability will be modest, which is prudent; however, the Project's potential impact on&#13;
strengthening PKSF and the small/medium POs and enhancing sustainability and accountability of their&#13;
credit programs, is large. In addition, the Project should significantly increase coverage of new&#13;
borrowers over the four-year implementation period.&#13;
4.12   As a result of the Project, PKSF's annual disbursements would increase from Tk 0.5 billion in&#13;
FY96 to about Tk 2.4 billion in FY2000. This growth is not out of line with past pattern (para 2.14).&#13;
9   Assuming average loans of US$ 150 per family to 10 million target families which are yet to be covered.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
Moreover, PKSF's past low disbursement level is a reflection of both scarcity of loanable funds and its&#13;
policy of gradually increasing loan size in line with PO's absorptive capacity. Thus, the POs have not&#13;
only had to limit lending to no more than 25% of group members already mobilized but also had to&#13;
lower unit loan size to expand horizontal outreach. PKSF's borrowers, and in turn PKSF, could easily&#13;
triple their lending in 2-3 years just by increasing coverage to 70-75% of the existing group members-&#13;
the norm for Grameen/BRAC is 85-90%-without much risk of poor lending, lowering of PKSF's&#13;
appraisal standards or creating a "disbursement" mentality. The simplicity of the system permits its&#13;
rapid replication; moreover, the enhanced monitoring and accountability arrangements proposed under&#13;
the Project should reduce the above risks further.&#13;
Credit Use&#13;
4.13   Under the Project, funds will be channeled as follows. GOB will lend IDA funds (and its own)&#13;
to PKSF which in turn will re-lend these to eligible POs; the latter will on-lend to the beneficiaries.&#13;
Recognizing the segmentation of the market into a few large institutions and numerous small/medium&#13;
POs, the various aspects - credit allocation, eligibility criteria, terms and conditions-have been tailored&#13;
to suit this market structure.&#13;
4.14   About half of the credit component is notionally earmarked for the small/medium POs, with the&#13;
remaining for the large POs. This would ensure that the large POs, who have better access to external&#13;
funds, do not crowd out the equally efficient and promising small/medium POs. At the same time, a&#13;
predetermined allocation for the large POs would assure them of stability of funding for their medium-&#13;
term business plans and encourage them to use available scarce grant resources for mobilizing new&#13;
groups. In anticipation of the Project, PKSF has recently approved loans to two large POs-a loan of&#13;
Tk 1.4 billion (US$34 million) to BRAC and Tk 0.8 billion (US$19 million) to ASA. The allocations&#13;
between small/medium and large POs would be reviewed at mid-term, taking into account actual&#13;
experience.&#13;
4.15   The Project funds will enable POs to expand both horizontal and vertical outreach; except for&#13;
BRAC, all other POs will use the funds for general portfolio expansion. BRAC intends to use Project&#13;
funds exclusively for expanding its credit program for women participating in its Vulnerable Group&#13;
Development Program (Annex 1, para 10). By supporting this particular program, IDA funds would&#13;
reach the poorest segments of the rural population.&#13;
Institutional Eligibility Criteria&#13;
4.16   The eligibility criteria described below would apply to institutions implementing the Project.&#13;
4.17   PKSF would need to meet the following criteria to be eligible to borrow IDA (and GOB)&#13;
funds: (a) continue to have an independent Governing Body, professional management and staff and&#13;
sound operating policies; (b) maintain a strong and transparent accounting, MIS and internal audit&#13;
system; (c) continue to have its accounts audited by reputable external auditors on annual basis; and (d)&#13;
maintain a loan recovery rate of 98% on a continuous basis.&#13;
4.18   Small/Medium POs borrowing from PKSF. The following criteria, currently used by PKSF in&#13;
selecting POs, will be used under the Project: (a) the PO has a demonstrated track record of running a&#13;
successful microcredit program, or in the view of PKSF demonstrates the potential to do so after&#13;
technical assistance and capacity building; (b) the minimum loan recovery rate is 95%; (c) the PO&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
possesses adequate skilled, salaried staff for intensive supervision, and has a good management&#13;
committee; and (d) the PO is using a standard double entry accounting system, or is willing to adopt it&#13;
with PKSF's assistance.&#13;
4.19   Large POs (such as BRAC, ASA, etc.) would be eligible to borrow from PKSF provided:&#13;
(a) the institution has been operating a successful microcredit program for a minimum of 5 years; (b) it&#13;
has at least 100,000 borrowers with a strong potential for expansion; (c) the institution has at least Tk&#13;
100 million of equity (including foreign grants, retained earnings etc.) of its own in the program; (d)&#13;
the debt-equity ratio does not exceed 2.5:1 to avoid excessive leveraging. This would not apply to&#13;
Grameen Bank or POs which become banks and which would need to meet prudential capital adequacy&#13;
standards established by the central bank; (e) the institution maintains a strong and transparent&#13;
accounting, MIS and internal audit system; (f) the institution has its accounts audited by reputable&#13;
external auditor on an annual basis; and (g) it maintains a loan recovery rate of 95 %.&#13;
4.20   At present, while PKSF mandates savings mobilization and financial viability, it has not&#13;
established any targets that POs should meet for their credit programs in the short, medium or long&#13;
term in respect of sustainability indicators such as: savings mobilization, coverage of credit operating&#13;
costs from interest income, profitability, equity build-up, etc. Under the Project, PKSF will study and&#13;
incorporate forward-looking financial indicators in the eligibility criteria (para 4.33) to ensure that POs'&#13;
credit programs are moving along the continuum to full financial sustainability.&#13;
Credit Terms and Conditions&#13;
4.21   GOB Loan, and IDA funds, on-lent to PKSF would have an interest rate of 1 %, and a&#13;
maturity period of 20 years (including a 5-year grace period).&#13;
4.22   PKSF Loan to Small/Medium POs would have a maturity of three years and differentiated&#13;
interest rates (referred to as service-charge by PKSF) as follows: (a) 3% for POs with cumulative&#13;
borrowing from PKSF of Tk 5 million; (b) 4% for POs with cumulative borrowing from PKSF of Tk&#13;
5-75 million; (c) 4.5% for POs with cumulative borrowing from PKSF above Tk 75 million.&#13;
4.23   PKSF Loan to large POs would carry an interest rate of 5 %, and PKSF would decide on the&#13;
maturity and grace period, based on review of the PO's ability to repay from its income and reflows.&#13;
These loans will have the following features: (a) they will be approved on the basis of medium-term&#13;
business plans submitted by the POs to provide a firm planning horizon for them, since their programs&#13;
are large-scale and require considerable up-front preparation; (b) the loans will be of longer maturity&#13;
(10-14 years including grace) in line with needs of the program, with PKSF deciding on the final terms&#13;
of each loan based on the PO's overall cash flow projections. Unlike PKSF's small/medium POs which&#13;
require much tighter control and monitoring over fund flow (and hence the three-year funding cycle),&#13;
the large POs do not need to be subjected to this policy because they have a sound track record and&#13;
well developed internal controls/MIS; (c) disbursement will be made at a minimum on a quarterly basis&#13;
to these POs since they are dealing with larger volumes and more borrowers and, after the first&#13;
advance, disbursement would only be made provided the institution continued to meet eligibility criteria&#13;
(para 4.19).&#13;
4.24   During the Project period, it is conceivable that a large PO (e.g., Grameen) may issue bonds.&#13;
While PKSF's policies do not allow it to subscribe to bonds, it might decide to change this policy in&#13;
future. If PKSF does so, and subject to prior consultation with IDA, it would be allowed to use Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
funds, up to $10 million, to subscribe to PO bonds provided that: (a) the bonds are intended to finance&#13;
expansion of inicrocredit portfolio; (b) institution meets the above eligibility criteria; and (c) the interest&#13;
rate on bonds is not lower than prevailing interest rate on loans to large POs.&#13;
4.25   PO Loans to the Final Borrowers. Interest rates will be market determined, and the POs will&#13;
have full autonomy to set their loan maturity periods (usually 52 weeks) and onlending rates; the&#13;
effective interest rates are expected to range between 25 and 30% (para 3.4). With the greater&#13;
availability of funds, competition among POs will increase which could possibly result in a reduction of&#13;
rates.&#13;
4.26   Currency of Loans. All loans-from GOB to PKSF, from PKSF to POs and from POs to the&#13;
poor-will be denominated in local currency, with GOB bearing the exchange risk without any fee&#13;
(para 6.18).&#13;
Rationale for Lending Terms and Conditions&#13;
4.27   The interest rates at the beneficiary level are much higher than interest rates in the formal&#13;
sector; however, they have an element of subsidy resulting from GOB providing IDA funds to PKSF at&#13;
less than market rates. The proposed project financing strategy-low cost, long maturity external&#13;
funds-is appropriate and fully justified on account of the poverty objective and is necessary to allow&#13;
these well functioning poverty oriented institutions sufficient time to enhance the financial viability of&#13;
their financial services, while at the same time pursuing their outreach goals and nonlending services.&#13;
The rate structure would enable GOB to cover foreign exchange risks (up to 5% p.a., para 6.18) and,&#13;
avoid the need for PKSF/PO to raise current onlending rates.&#13;
4.28   A significant part of the high operating costs, which necessitates large margin to POs, is on&#13;
account of bringing banking to the poor and "non-commercial" operating costs-group mobilization,&#13;
nonlending services provided to groups, costs incurred on group members who do not borrow.&#13;
Largely for administrative ease and partly for inability to easily allocate costs between "normal costs"&#13;
of providing credit and these costs, GOB and donors have financed these costs mainly through&#13;
subsidized funding. Donors and POs have explored the possibility of providing grants for&#13;
noncommercial costs, and market-priced loans for regular lending. There is a consensus that the&#13;
present approach is working very well, and that changing to a loan-cum-grant system would impose&#13;
large administrative and reporting burden on POs, require changing the whole operating and&#13;
monitoring system built around the present method of financing, and possibly lead to abuse.&#13;
Importantly, PKSF does not want to be seen as a grant giving agency since it believes that this would&#13;
undermine financial discipline. That is why it strongly rejected the GOB Task Force proposal that the&#13;
pilot program for funding equipment acquisition (e.g., computers) by POs (para 4.34) be on a grant&#13;
basis and insisted that it be a loan even if is interest free.&#13;
4.29   It is proposed to continue the present fixed interest rate policy considering that neither POs nor&#13;
borrowers have the ability to manage interest rate risks. In addition, it is proposed to follow PKSF's&#13;
differentiated interest rate policy-lower rate for small POs and higher rate for larger POs-under the&#13;
Project. This "ability-to-pay" pricing policy is meant to promote newer POs and lower their costs&#13;
while their lending volume builds up. While the best policy would be to have a risk-differentiated rate&#13;
structure combined with a grant for smaller POs, the current approach is easier to manage&#13;
administratively and avoids the risk of abuse. With operating costs amounting to 3 % of loans&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
outstanding in FY96, and expected to decline to 1.6% in FY99, PKSF would have a positive operating&#13;
margin even at its lowest lending rate of 3 %.&#13;
4.30   While the proposed relending interest rate structure is fully justified, nevertheless it should be&#13;
comprehensively reviewed periodically (Para 4.33), to assess the appropriateness of the rate structure&#13;
in light of poverty and sustainability objectives and prevailing rates in the formal sector. The first&#13;
comprehensive rate review would be undertaken prior to mid-term (para 5.13).&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
4.31   The Project includes a US$6 million institutional development component, of which US$5.85&#13;
million has been allocated for strengthening institutional capacity within the PKSF and its POs and the&#13;
remaining US$0.15 million to Bangladesh Bank. PKSF is a well run, autonomous and efficient&#13;
organization; however, it will need further institutional strengthening and changes in its operating&#13;
policies to enable it to effectively handle a large increase in its loan portfolio. It also needs institutional&#13;
development to effectively handle its mandate as the apex financial institution with responsibility for&#13;
nurturing and monitoring POs. For the most part, Project-supported training and institution building&#13;
would be focused towards PKSF and small/medium POs. The institutional development needs of the&#13;
large POs are covered under their donor-financed programs, which have a large staff development and&#13;
institution building components; therefore, they would not need technical assistance resources from&#13;
PKSF for expansion of Project financed lending. Of the US$5.85 million, US$0.5 million will used by&#13;
PKSF to provide interest free loans to its POs for consultants and hardware for program expansion, and&#13;
the remaining US$5.35 million for its own institutional development including capacity to assist&#13;
small/medium POs borrowing from it.&#13;
PKSF's Institutional Development Program&#13;
4.32   This will include measures to enhance financial sustainability of PKSF and POs, strengthen&#13;
accountability, improve staff skills and assess socioeconomic impact of POs' programs, as discussed&#13;
below with details in Annex 5. At negotiations, agreement was reached with GOB and PKSF that this&#13;
program would be initiated in tandem with the credit component.&#13;
4.33   PKSF would undertake studies and thereafter change its policies in the following two areas: (a)&#13;
to enhancefinancial sustainability, PKSF would: (i) establish a policy that the level of PKSF support&#13;
to all POs in the future would also depend, among other factors, on the POs' progress towards financial&#13;
sustainability of their credit operations. To implement this policy, PKSF would establish forward&#13;
looking financial performance standards that it would use to measure POs' progress in regards to&#13;
sustainability; (ii) establish a loan classification and provisioning policy for itself, and guidelines for the&#13;
POs, taking into account past experience and potential future risks; and (iii) periodically reviewing&#13;
appropriateness of it's relending rate structure; (b) to strengthen accountability, PKSF would: (i)&#13;
establish audit standards/requirements for POs and (ii) formulate guidelines for its POs on uniform&#13;
accounting policies, particularly those for reporting repayment rates, arrears, rescheduling, portfolio&#13;
quality, etc. Another aspect on which guidelines would be developed is a better cost accounting system&#13;
to separate and measure the costs of delivering lending and nonlending services for the multipurpose&#13;
POs, without imposing excessive burden/cost on them. Terms of Reference (TORs) for all the above&#13;
studies were agreed at negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
4.34   PKSF would also undertake the following Institution Building programs/measures to strengthen&#13;
skills of PKSF/PO staff and institutional capacity:&#13;
(a)    Establish a new unit-large PO Window-to enable PKSF to appraise and supervise&#13;
large POs. PKSF has recently established the new unit, which would enable it to&#13;
effectively and efficiently handle the special characteristics of these large organizations,&#13;
and avoid diluting the needed attention to small/medium POs.&#13;
(b)    Strengthen MIS and expand coverage of the system to: (i) quickly identify POs facing&#13;
unsatisfactory repayment rates at the field level; (ii) enable PKSF to track repayment&#13;
performance of entire credit operations of those POs (e.g., ASA) that have other&#13;
sources of funding; (iii) and enable it to evaluate financial performance, on a regular&#13;
basis, of all its POs and monitor their evolution.&#13;
(c)    Establish a small training unit which would develop and undertake comprehensive&#13;
training programs for PKSF and PO staff. It would use PKSF's own center, to be&#13;
established under the Project, and existing training centers of large POs.&#13;
(d)    Recruit staff to strengthen its own financial planning capacity.&#13;
(e)    Strengthen financial accountability at PO level through: (i) expanding its own internal&#13;
audit cell. The cell staff would audit each PO twice a year and would visit POs, field&#13;
offices, and borrowers, on a representative sample basis, to review: use of funds;&#13;
integrity and quality of accounting/MIS records at the field level and those submitted to&#13;
PKSF; loan collection rates, etc.; (ii) expanding TORs of PKSF's statutory external&#13;
auditor and require it to audit one-third of the POs each year; and (iii) requiring all&#13;
POs, with loans over Tk 3 million, to have audits according to TORs, and by audit&#13;
firms, acceptable to PKSF.&#13;
(f)    Establish a Technical Assistance Fund to: (i) initiate a pilot program of interest-free&#13;
equipment loans (e.g., for computers, motorcycles, etc.) to help successful POs with a&#13;
good track record expand their operations. These interest-free loans would be&#13;
channeled along with loans that PKSF would provide for the POs' microcredit&#13;
program; and (ii) finance technical assistance needs (e.g., accounting/MIS consultants)&#13;
of individual POs.&#13;
(g)    Establish Impact Evaluation Program. Many POs periodically assess socioeconomic&#13;
impact of the programs. Except for large institutions, like BRAC and Proshika, the&#13;
impact evaluation capacity and quality is, at best, rudimentary. While PKSF's Charter&#13;
requires it to periodically undertake impact evaluation, it does not have a systematic&#13;
and regular program; under the Project this capacity would be developed. It is&#13;
envisaged that PKSF would enter into a contract with a local socioeconomic research&#13;
institute which would establish, in consultation with POs, base line surveys and regular&#13;
data collection and analysis.&#13;
(h)    Undertake external training and study tours, for PKSF and PO staff, to study and&#13;
review microfinance related matters. One area of emphasis would be to review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
experience of MFIs in other countries which have become formal financial sector&#13;
institutions.&#13;
(i)    Construct a head office/training center, with covered area of about 40,000 sq. ft.&#13;
PKSF currently operates out of a residential house.&#13;
Strengthening Regulation and Promotion&#13;
4.35   Measures need to be taken to proactively promote economically viable MFIs graduate to formal&#13;
financial institutions, and to regulate MFIs raising deposits, particularly those raising deposits from&#13;
nonmembers. These initiatives would be developed and managed by Bangladesh Bank (BB), and for&#13;
this an amount of US$150,000 has been allocated to it. Specifically BB would undertake the following&#13;
studies in collaboration with PKSF and POs, and upon completion initiate a program including staff&#13;
training and study tours to implement recommendations of the studies: (a) regulatory reforms and&#13;
proactive measures to enhance linkage of MFIs with formal financial sector (e.g. developing market for&#13;
securitization of MFI assets, voluntary lending to MFIs by commercial banking system, etc.), and&#13;
measures to promote interested MFIs become formal financial institutions along with guidelines that&#13;
should be used by GOB/BB for determining their readiness; (b) appropriate regulatory framework and&#13;
institutions for regulating and monitoring MFIs engaged in deposit taking, while recognizing: (i) the&#13;
special nature of these institutions; (ii) the inherent strong self regulation in the system, which&#13;
minimizes the need for regulatory oversight; and (iii) that unlike formal financial institutions, depositors&#13;
of MFIs are usually net borrowers from the system which obviates the need for depositor protection.&#13;
TORs for these studies were agreed at negotiations.&#13;
5.  IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
Credit Institutions&#13;
5.1    The PKSF would be the apex financial intermediary onlending IDA funds to the POs. It has&#13;
recently entered into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement (SLA) with GOB, under which IDA/GOB funds&#13;
would be on-lent to it; the SLA spells out PKSF's responsibilities under the Project, the lending terms&#13;
and conditions, reporting and auditing requirements and details of PKSF's institutional development&#13;
program. In all, around 130 MFIs are currently eligible to borrow IDA funds through PKSF.&#13;
5.2    Small/Medium POs. Presently there are 124 small/medium POs which meet the eligibility&#13;
criteria and are borrowers of PKSF in good standing. Over the next four years, PKSF envisages that no&#13;
more than 60-70 additional NGOs (out of existing 200-250 NGOs who are non-borrowers of PKSF and&#13;
profess to have credit operations) are likely to meet the eligibility criteria. Thus, in all, the Project is&#13;
likely to finance about 200 POs.&#13;
5.3    Large POs. At present there are four institutions, Grameen Bank, Proshika, BRAC and ASA,&#13;
which potentially meet the eligibility criteria for large POs. Grameen's medium-term program does not&#13;
envisage any borrowings from PKSF, as it has recently received a loan from Japan OECF (US$30&#13;
million at I % for 30 years). In addition, BRDB's successful microcredit program is a potential&#13;
program that appears to meet a number of the large-PO criteria. While BRDB as an institution is&#13;
excluded from the Project in light of chequered performance of its general rural credit programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
through cooperatives, its group-based microcredit scheme under the Canadian funded RD-12 program&#13;
has been operating successfully. However, access to Project funds would be conditional on the&#13;
program's institutional arrangements being changed (i.e. RD-I' becoming a legally independent MFI)&#13;
in accordance with measures outlined by Canadian CIDA and the program meeting the Project's&#13;
institutional/financial eligibility criteria. CIDA has been the main financier of the program and has&#13;
indicated that while it would be willing to support RD-12's institutional strengthening program, it&#13;
cannot support the credit component any longer because of unavailability of funds.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
5.4    The procurement arrangements for goods and services would be undertaken in accordance with&#13;
standard World Bank Procedures as follows (Table 5.1).&#13;
5.5    Credit Component. The final borrower's use of loans will be determined by the borrower in&#13;
consultation with the PO providing these loans. POs' procedures, high interest rates on loans, stringent&#13;
repayment requirements and borrower's self-interest all ensure that the procurement is economic and&#13;
efficient. Most loans will be used for non-farm activity. Goods and services purchased with loan&#13;
proceeds will all have close to 100% local content. Through its own supervision and strengthening of&#13;
field level financial accountability arrangements, PKSF would ensure that the microcredit loans are&#13;
used productively.&#13;
5.6    Civil Works. The estimated cost of the civil worKs for the Head Office building and training&#13;
center, is about $3.0 million. This contract would be awarded through national competitive bidding&#13;
(NCB), using bid documents and procedures satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
5.7    Goods and Equipment. These are expected to cost about $1.05 million, spread over four&#13;
years. No contract is expected to exceed $75,000, and most contracts will range from $5-20 thousand.&#13;
These include items such as office furniture, motorcycles, personal computers and training equipment&#13;
in small quantities which would not attract the interests of foreign suppliers, and therefore would be&#13;
procured on the basis of prudent shopping (at least three priced quotations). For all contracts over&#13;
$20,000, these would be procured through national competitive bidding, using bid documents and&#13;
procedures satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
5.8    Consultancies. The estimated costs of consultant contracts and training study/tours is about&#13;
$1.95 million. Consultancies would be procured in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines for&#13;
Use of Consultants.&#13;
5.9    Prior Review. Each individual contract over $100,000 (for civil works) and $75,000 (for&#13;
goods and equipment) would be subject to IDA's prior review. About 80% of the total estimated civil&#13;
works and goods procurement would be subject to IDA's review. Consultant assignments exceeding&#13;
$100,000 (for firms) and $50,000 (for individuals) would be subject to prior review. Post review&#13;
would be undertaken of the remainder.&#13;

the lines indicated in Table 5.2 below.&#13;

5.11   To facilitate disbursements a Special Account with an authorized allocation of US$8 million&#13;
would be opened in BB, into which IDA funds would be disbursed. PKSF would be responsible for&#13;
managing the Special Account and handling all disbursement matters. SOEs would be used for: (a) all&#13;
expenditures under the microcredit component; (b) civil works below $100,000; (c) goods below&#13;
$75,000; and (d) consultant contracts below $100,000 (firms) and $50,000 (individuals). The basis for&#13;
reimbursement on account of the microcredit component would be the net increase (i.e. increase in loan&#13;
outstanding) in POs microcredit loans financed from funds provided by PKSF; Annex 6 provides the&#13;
SOE format that PKSF would use for this purpose. GOB has already provided $5 million of its&#13;
contribution (US$10 million) to PKSF and would provide the remainder at the beginning of FY97/98.&#13;
The Project funds are expected to be fully disbursed in about four years, by June 30, 2000 (Annex 6).&#13;
Monitoring and Reporting Requirements&#13;
5.12   PKSF has a well-developed monitoring system; its monthly report to its Governing Body and&#13;
the Annual report it publishes are sufficient to monitor the IDA credit, given a few additions to these&#13;
reports. PKSF will submit the following reports to Ministry of Finance (and through them, to IDA):&#13;
(a) a quarterly report detailing progress of IDA credit and review of Project's performance indicators&#13;
(Annex 7); (b) an Annual Report, including review of evolution of the MFI system and progress of its&#13;
POs towards increasing borrower outreach and enhancing their financial sustainability; (c) an external&#13;
audit report within 6 months of the close of the financial year. The auditor's report would include&#13;
auditor's opinions on: quality of PKSF's general accounting practices, adequacy of MIS and internal&#13;
audit/control systems, adequacy of loan classification and provisioning policies, accuracy of loan&#13;
recovery rates and overdues reported in the quarterly reports, and accuracy of SOEs submitted to IDA&#13;
for fund withdrawal; and (d) at the beginning of each year, it's business plan outlining detailed&#13;
financial, operational, and institutional plans for the following year and broad goals in these areas for&#13;
the following 3-4 years.&#13;
5.13   Annex 7 details the Project monitoring and evaluation plan and performance indicators which&#13;
were agreed at negotiations. These indicators will enable tracking of the Project's twin objectives-&#13;
poverty reduction and financial sustainability of credit programs. A mid-term review will be held in&#13;
July 1998 or after 50% of the funds are disbursed (whichever is earlier) to review overall progress of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
the Project and lessons learned, and agree on changes, if any, to Project scope and design. Prior to&#13;
mid-term, PKSF would prepare a comprehensive review report.&#13;
IDA Supervision&#13;
5.14   The project is expected to require, on average, about 18-20 staff weeks per year of supervision,&#13;
or about 90 weeks over the four year implementation period, including the time for project launch&#13;
workshop and mid-term review. This reflects: (a) the innovative nature of the project; (b) the&#13;
logistical challenges of the dispersed area of operations of POs; and (c) that this is IDA's first project in&#13;
the sector. A supervision plan, including the project launch workshop, formal reviews, and regular&#13;
supervision missions is shown in Annex 7. Given the nature of the Project, in due course supervision&#13;
responsibility would be devolved to the resident mission.&#13;
6. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND IMPACT&#13;
6.1    As discussed below, the Project is justified on the following grounds: (a) it would be&#13;
instrumental in furthering the paramount economy-wide objective in Bangladesh-namely alleviation of&#13;
poverty-by enabling the poor to undertake micro-investments that have a high return and fostering&#13;
social empowerment; (b) traditional sources for expanding microcredit programs-donor grants and&#13;
member savings-are inherently limited; and (c) it promotes institutional and financial sustainability of&#13;
the microcredit program and the institutions.&#13;
Rationale for Publicly Provided Concessional Funding&#13;
6.2    Overall, microcredit programs have demonstrated their potential for being a successful&#13;
intervention and NGO-based institutions as effective and efficient delivery vehicles for: (a)&#13;
overcoming failure of the formal financial sector to provide financial services to the poor; and (b)&#13;
reducing poverty and correcting gender inequality (paras 3.16-3.18). Therefore, scaling up of NGO-&#13;
based microcredit programs is fully warranted within the context of a comprehensive poverty&#13;
alleviation strategy comprising other complementary investments.&#13;
6.3    Traditional sources of financing-mandatory savings by borrowers and grants from&#13;
bilateral/NGO donors-will continue to be a funding source for the program; however, there are&#13;
limitations to these sources and there is growing uncertainty about the availability of donor funds in the&#13;
amounts available in the past. Thus, for the programs to expand significantly and reach a large&#13;
percentage of the poor in Bangladesh, majority of the funding would have to come from other sources&#13;
outside the system-market and/or publicly provided funding. Voluntary market-based provision of&#13;
funding from the financial system-in form of POs borrowing from the banking system, raising&#13;
deposits from non-members or banks lending directly to the poor-could potentially provide large&#13;
amounts of funding, and would be promoted under the Project (para 4.35). However, they are only&#13;
likely to materialize in any significant way, over the long term, for the following reasons: (a) the&#13;
urgent priority for the banking system is to complete much needed sector reforms, restore the system's&#13;
financial health and overcome the pervasive default culture before encouraging banks into new lines of&#13;
business which require uncollateralized loans; (b) commercial banks are unlikely to voluntarily get into&#13;
microcredit business on account of their predilection to shy away from the asset-less, and their&#13;
operating culture and procedures which are geared to the relatively well off, well connected and more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
vocal segments of rural and urban society; (c) allowing POs to raise deposits from non-members would&#13;
give rise to a host of regulatory and supervision issues which the central bank is not in a position to&#13;
deal with at the present time; (d) most POs are not keen to raise deposits from non-members as they&#13;
perceive that this shift could lead to diversion of staff efforts away from social and human development&#13;
to deposit mobilization, and (e) using market-based mechanism would raise final lending rates and&#13;
adversely affect consumption/asset build up of the poor. Thus over the foreseeable future, pending&#13;
fundamental reforms and "institutional culture" change in the financial sector to overcome market&#13;
failure, rapid expansion of POs' microcredit programs can only be sustained through publicly provided&#13;
loans through the well functioning PKSF apex mechanism.&#13;
6.4    Concessional funding is needed to support the following objectives: (a) enable POs to bring&#13;
banking to the doorsteps of the poor, and pursue their credit-cum-social empowerment approach to&#13;
poverty alleviation; (b) provide PKSF and POs the ability to build up their equity base, and hence the&#13;
long-run financial sustainability of their lending services; (c) increase profitability of PO's financial&#13;
services, thereby enabling them to provide multidimensional credit, nonlending services and pursue the&#13;
costlier strategy of horizontal outreach expansion; and (d) increase the poor's consumption and savings&#13;
since the POs are mostly pass-through organizations. Given the incidence and depth of poverty and&#13;
gender inequality, a policy of leaving money in the hands of the poor, particularly women, as against&#13;
generating reflows back to the government through higher relending rates, is fully justified.&#13;
6.5   It is unlikely that there will be a direct fiscal cost arising from the concessional funding ( para.&#13;
6.18), even though it will result in an economic subsidy. The size of the subsidy depends on what is&#13;
considered an appropriate benchmark rate. If all the POs were allowed to raise deposits from the&#13;
general public, their average cost of funds would be the same as that of commercial banks, i.e. 6-7%.&#13;
On this basis, the economic subsidy ranges from 1-2% (for large POs) to 3-4% (for small POs) of loan&#13;
amount. For those POs that cannot raise funds from the market because of perceived risks and had to&#13;
rely on a wholesaler like PKSF, the costs of funds would be higher. Thus if PKSF had to raise funds&#13;
from the market for onlending, the cost to the POs would be about 8-9%. POs would also face this&#13;
interest rate if they borrowed from commercial banks. On this basis, the economic subsidy amounts to&#13;
5-6%. Assuming an eight year lending cycle-with initial loan of Tk 2,000 increasing to Tk 9,000 in&#13;
eight years-and implicit subsidy of 5 %, the lifetime subsidy would amount to about US$55 per&#13;
beneficiary or about US$7 per annum. In aggregate the annual economic subsidy would amount to&#13;
about US$5 million, once the credit is fully disbursed.&#13;
6.6    There has not been a comprehensive cost-benefit or welfare analysis of whether the implicit&#13;
subsidy in the microcredit mechanism is the most appropriate and cost-effective mechanism to achieve&#13;
objectives identified in para 6.4. However, if government programs were taken as alternatives, a study&#13;
is not needed to convincingly demonstrate that the multi-dimensional MFIs are much better at service&#13;
delivery-quality and client responsiveness-and importantly have low levels of abuse. The Food-for-&#13;
Work program, which is single dimensional, has significant leakages amounting to about 40-45 % of&#13;
food provided to the program.&#13;
6.7    The desirability and level of concessional public funding needs to be regularly revisited, in line&#13;
with the changing poverty status of beneficiaries, improving financial position of POs and PKSF and&#13;
development of linkages between the POs and the formal financial system. The comprehensive impact&#13;
evaluation system, to be established under the Project, and the PKSF's monitoring of financial&#13;
evolution of the PO system would enable GOB and IDA to review this issue periodically.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Project Impact&#13;
6.8    The impact of the Project has been assessed in five ways: (a) impact on program outreach and&#13;
the beneficiaries; (b) impact on sustainability of microfinance programs of POs; (c) impact on the&#13;
budget; (d) impact on the RNF sector; and (e) environmental impact.&#13;
6.9   Impact on Program Outreach and Poor. As a result of the Project., POs would be in a&#13;
position to increase their lending, thereby increasing coverage of the poor who are eligible for credit.&#13;
It is difficult to estimate with any degree of accuracy how many people will be covered by the Project,&#13;
given that some part of the funds will be used for vertical as opposed to horizontal outreach; however,&#13;
rough estimates based on past pattern of outreach growth suggest that the Project funds would benefit&#13;
roughly 1.2 million borrowers-over 90% of whom would be women. Most of them would need credit&#13;
support beyond the Project period to move out of poverty. The average loan of current borrowers of&#13;
PKSF's POs is about Tk 2,500. By the end of the Project the average loan is expected to be about Tk&#13;
6-7 thousand, compared to minimum loan of Tk 8-10 thousand that a borrower needs to have for a few&#13;
years to cross the poverty line. Thus, as long as Project beneficiaries continue to receive loans of&#13;
increasing amounts and rural economy grows as in the past, majority of them should be moving out of&#13;
poverty in about 4-6 years after the Project period.&#13;
6.10   The financial returns to Project beneficiaries are expected to be substantial. Based on a survey&#13;
of beneficiaries by the appraisal mission and impact evaluation studies by PKSF and MFIs, the annual&#13;
net income (after payment of loan and costs of cash inputs) is expected to range from 100% to 150% of&#13;
the loan amount, on activities such as basket weaving, poultry and livestock rearing, street vending and&#13;
retail trade, rickshaw plying, rice husking, etc. These are returns to own labor and non-cash inputs&#13;
and are typical in service and low capital intensive activities. Moreover, the 95 % + repayment rates at&#13;
very high interest rates are also an indication of the high profitability of these activities; while&#13;
repayments may be coming from other activities (and payments by group members in case of inability&#13;
to pay), the consistently high repayment rates year-after-year and low drop-out rates from the&#13;
programs is a clear indication that microcredit financed activities must be yielding returns much higher&#13;
than interest rates. While the returns are high, in percentage terms, they do not account for risks such&#13;
as natural disasters, sickness, etc. Also, given the small size of loans, in absolute amounts the cash&#13;
incomes resulting from these investments are very small. They are, however, a major supplement to&#13;
the household income of those who live below the poverty line. Thus the additional income from a&#13;
typical microcredit financed activity may bring in up to Tk 3,500, raising the household income of the&#13;
landless by 15% annually; with loan amount increasing over time, the income would grow at around&#13;
this rate annually.&#13;
6.11  Impact on Sustainability of PKSF and its POs. The Project would significantly increase&#13;
PKSF's profitability and long-term sustainability, and will be instrumental in moving the PO system&#13;
towards financial and economic viability stages ( para 3.11). The Project will also push the frontiers of&#13;
microfinance by supporting studies on various issues affecting microfinance in Bangladesh, identify&#13;
appropriate regulatory framework for prudential supervision, increasing knowledge on deposit&#13;
mobilization, and improving understanding of the impact of program design on sustainability.&#13;
6.12   POs. All available evidence clearly indicates that the basic microcredit model is intrinsically&#13;
viable and that availability of concessional funding should enable the POs to move along the viability&#13;
continuum (para 3.11). At present, majority of the PKSF's POs are at or below the operational viability&#13;
stage. As highlighted in para 3.13, the time frame for financial maturity of these POs and the duration&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
for providing subsidy and budgetary funding would depend upon several factors, many related to their&#13;
development objectives. As an example, it has taken Grameen Bank over a decade to reach financial&#13;
viability stage as it pursued a rapid horizontal outreach objective. In addition, PO's sustainability is&#13;
closely linked to poverty status of the borrower. Thus, as long as most borrowers are below the&#13;
poverty line and institutions are in the rapid horizontal outreach phase where new loss-making&#13;
borrowers far outstrip profit yielding borrowers, concessional funding would be needed. Once average&#13;
loans for all borrowers reach Tk 8-10 thousand, their incomes will have crossed the poverty line and&#13;
justification for providing concessional funding to POs on poverty grounds would no longer remain.&#13;
6.13   The following Project-induced evolution-which is at best very tentative given the large&#13;
number of POs with wide differences in their initial conditions, policies, outreach objectives and scope&#13;
of services-is envisioned for the PO system, and would be nurtured and tracked by PKSF. While a&#13;
few small POs might wither away because of weak management and/or poor lending, most POs will&#13;
grow and are likely to follow two distinct institutional tracks: (a) the Project's focus on financial&#13;
sustainability will wean many institutions towards the "mostly-credit" mode, many of whom may well&#13;
become full fledged financial institutions once they reach economic viability stage for the credit&#13;
program as well as the institution as a whole; and (b) a large number of POs will continue to emphasize&#13;
multi-dimensional credit and retain their multi-faceted quasi-commercial and quasi-formal character-&#13;
and for good reason. While these institutions will have profitable credit programs, the institutions as a&#13;
whole will be loss making on account of substantial nonlending services and in some cases (e.g.&#13;
Proshika) totally dependent on outside funds because their development model requires borrowers to&#13;
keep savings outside the institutions. Considering that the development model of these institutions&#13;
results in similar, if not better, poverty reduction and social empowerment achievements, continued&#13;
public support would be fully warranted even if the institutions as a whole are loss making or rely on&#13;
outside funding.&#13;
6.14   By the end of the Project period, average loans are expected to be around Tk 6-7 thousand per&#13;
beneficiary, and the two track evolution (para 6.13) is likely to be as follows: (a) POs having loans of&#13;
PKSF's above size or higher (i.e. those emphasizing vertical outreach) would have reached the&#13;
fiinancial viability stage, albeit on the basis of subsidized funding. A selected few such POs would be&#13;
economically viable and ready, and should be allowed, to become regular or specialized banks; the&#13;
setting of PKSF's onlending interest to these POs at close to the average cost of deposits of the banking&#13;
system and the mechanism for periodic rate review should prepare them for becoming banks. By this&#13;
time, the initiatives to correct market failure as well as the efforts to establish a sound regulatory&#13;
framework and prudent eligibility guidelines (para 4.35) would also be in place. Moreover, the&#13;
Project's efforts to improve financial sustainability of these POs would enhance the confidence of the&#13;
banking system to lend to the POs on a voluntary basis and to their ability to securitize their loans; and&#13;
(b) majority of those POs emphasizing horizontal outreach and greater multi-dimensionality in credit&#13;
will have operationally viable credit programs, but most will continue to be loss making as institutions.&#13;
6.15  In 4-6 years after the Project, if continued concessional funding is provided, average loans&#13;
should reach Tk 9-10 thousand and incomes of the majority of the Project beneficiaries would have&#13;
crossed the poverty line. By this time: (a) majority of the "mostly credit" POs emphasizing vertical&#13;
outreach would be close to becoming economically viable, have a favorable capital structure-maiily&#13;
grants/long term concessional funding-and a portfolio comprising mostly profit-yielding borrowers;&#13;
this should provide them with the ability to borrow commercial funding for incremental increase in&#13;
vertical outreach, and consequently concessionality and public funding for these POs could be gradually&#13;
replaced by market-based and market-provided funding. Also by this time the "market correction"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
initiatives would start having a significant impact and reach a point which would enable the level of&#13;
public support to be phased out; and (b) most POs emphasizing horizontal outreach and multi-&#13;
dimensionality, would have financially viable credit programs.&#13;
6.16   PKSF. As a result of the Project, PKSF's annual disbursement would increase from Tk 0.5&#13;
billion in FY96 to about Tk 2.4 billion in FY2000; during the same period, its assets would increase&#13;
from Tk 1.0 billion to Tk 6.0 billion, while net income from Tk 65 million to Tk 46 million. The&#13;
following table highlights key financial indicators for the period FY95-FY2005. Detailed analysis is&#13;

6. 17   PSKF is projected to maintain a reasonable profitability and a sound financial position. The&#13;
drop in profitability during FY97 and FY98 is a combination of the following factors: a shift from&#13;
higher yielding investment assets into lower yielding loan assets; an increase in loan loss provisions&#13;
from 1 % to 2 %; and increase in administrative expenses on account of scaling up of operations.&#13;
PKSF's long term sustainability is closely tied to that of its POs and their borrowers. Longer term&#13;
projections indicate that after FY 2000, it should be possible to gradually phaseout concessionality in&#13;
interest rate (both on the borrowing and lending side) in line with the following: the evolution of the&#13;
PO sector with a large number of POs having crossed financial viability stage; and PKSF having built&#13;
up a large pool of concessional funds. Thus, PKSF could start to pay higher rates on incremental&#13;
borrowings and by FY 2015 it could pay 8% interest rate (7% higher than at present and 2% higher&#13;
than average cost of funds of the banking system) on all its borrowed funds and earn a satisfactory&#13;
1.9% return on assets, while raising the average lending rate only 4% points-from the 4.4% in FY&#13;
2000 to 8.5% in FY 2015. Because of higher cost of funding, the average interest expense (as % of&#13;
borrowed finds) increases from  1.0%  in FY 2000 to 6.3%  in FY 2015. The favorable debt:equity&#13;
ratio, which hovers around 7:1 beyond FY 2005, would enable PKSF to operate on a thin interest&#13;
margin and yet earn a satisfactory return on assets. By FY 2015, PKSF would be earning a return on&#13;
equity of about 15%, which should be sufficient to attract private capital.&#13;
6.18   Impact on the Budget. While most of the grant element of IDA resources is passed on to the&#13;
POs, and in turn to the poor, there is unlikely to be a direct fiscal cost of providing IDA funds at below&#13;
market rates. The grant element of GOB loan to PKSF is 55%, at an opportunity cost of capital of 8%,&#13;
compared to grant element of about 85 % in IDA loan to GOB. The grant element that GOB retains-&#13;
by charging 0.25% higher than IDA rate and having a shorter maturity of loan to PKSF-is adequate to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
compensate it for incurring the foreign exchange risks, unless the annual rate of depreciation of the&#13;
Taka against the US dollar exceeds 5%, p.a. and as long as GOB could earn a 8% return on reflows&#13;
from PKSF. A potential fiscal cost, over and above exchange rate depreciation exceeding 5%, would&#13;
result from the possibility of default; i.e., PKSF is not able to repay the GOB loan as per the agreed&#13;
terms and maturity. This in turn may arise due to a default by the POs. PKSF's and POs' loan&#13;
provisioning policies, present and to be developed under the Project, and other risk management&#13;
measures (para 6.21) would ensure that default risks remain within acceptable limits and do not get&#13;
passed on to GOB.&#13;
6.19   Impact on the Rural Economy: The Project is expected to have a positive impact (para 3.18)&#13;
on the rural economy by increasing participation in productive non-farm activities and increasing labor&#13;
force participation rates, particularly employment of women. By supporting and expanding PO&#13;
programs, the Project will increase participation in activities which are dynamic and productive and&#13;
that typically yield returns that are higher than the prevailing unskilled wage rate. Based on a World&#13;
Bank study that estimated capital-output ratios for representative MFI programs (Khandker, 1996), the&#13;
Project should lead to an increase in RNF output by US$250 million a year; this would amount to about&#13;
3 % of current output in the RNF sector. The high rates of return in RNF activities also suggest that&#13;
there is no evidence of a demand constraint for rural non-farm products. This implies that there will be&#13;
a continuing strong demand for microcredit in the rural areas.&#13;
6.20   Environmental Impact. The Project will have a beneficial impact on the environment by&#13;
reducing the pressure of agricultural activity on land, which is slowly leading to environmental&#13;
degradation in Bangladesh. As people move from agriculture to non-farm activity, this pressure will be&#13;
lessened; none of the major RNF activities promoted by the POs are known to have a negative impact&#13;
on the environment. The Project will, indirectly, also promote activities like sanitation, health and&#13;
family planning; this would have a positive impact on the environment. Moreover, the Project would&#13;
provide support to many POs who are conscious about preserving the environment; one such PO is&#13;
PKSF's third largest borrower and is managed by women. This institution lists protection for the&#13;
environment as an important objective, and implements this through its social forestry programs.&#13;
Risks&#13;
6.21   The Project is building upon success, a system that works and a program that has tremendous&#13;
ownership of all stakeholders-government, institutions and beneficiaries. Nevertheless, the program&#13;
faces two potential major risks: higher loan default risk, and risk of poor socioeconomic impact. i.e.,&#13;
the anticipated increase in socioeconomic and empowerment indicators does not materialize. So far,&#13;
loan default risks have remained less than 4-5 % for the system as a whole. Moreover all impact&#13;
evaluation studies conducted to-date, attest to the positive socioeconomic impact of the development&#13;
model pursued by the Bangladesh MFIs. Nevertheless as the program is scaled up, particularly for the&#13;
small/medium POs, many of the factors contributing to keeping the above two risks at acceptable levels&#13;
could diverge from the past pattern. These contributing factors and potential risks are:&#13;
(a)    horizontal expansion risk, which could increase because of inclusion of greater number&#13;
of vulnerable borrowers who live on the edge;&#13;
(b)    institutional risks, considering that many of the small/medium POs, and even large&#13;
POs, are dependent on the motivation and dynamism of one person and there is no&#13;
management succession plan;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
(c)    marketing risks, in that the local markets are unable to absorb the increased level of&#13;
production for the typical products produced by the beneficiaries;&#13;
(d)    concentration of risk, in that 3-4 POs would be absorbing over half the credit amount;&#13;
(e)    governance risks, which would result from appointment of poor management at PKSF&#13;
and/or politicization of the P0 selection and loan approval/disbursement processes;&#13;
(f)    under-disbursement risks, which could result from lower than expected demand for&#13;
credit and/or POs face capacity constraints or are unable to meet eligibility criteria on a&#13;
continuous basis; and&#13;
(g)    proliferation risks, which happened in many countries when availability of credit led to&#13;
proliferation of new institutions whose main goal was gaining access to cheap funds&#13;
rather than poverty alleviation.&#13;
6.22   Together with measures being taken under the Project, the following features of the microcredit&#13;
model, individually and collectively, ensure that the above contributing factors are kept in check&#13;
thereby ensuring that the system-wide default risks are kept within the 4-5% range and the risk of poor&#13;
impact is minimized:&#13;
Borrower Level:&#13;
(a)    the self-selection of activities, gradual build-up of individual loans, borrowers'&#13;
closeness to the markets and ability to switch easily among activities reduce the&#13;
marketing risks. Nevertheless, growth in the rural economy will be a major&#13;
determninant of market opportunities;&#13;
(b)    very high lending rates and rigors of the program prevent capture by the rural elites,&#13;
(c)    the transparent incentive of repeater and larger loan linked to full repayment of earlier&#13;
loans, and inability to get credit in the amount and regularity (and price) from other&#13;
sources, provides a powerful motivation to maintain high repayments. That is why,&#13;
even during natural disasters, the loan repayment rates remain high. In fact during the&#13;
1995 floods, other than a 4-5 week delay in repayments during the flooding period, the&#13;
MFIs did not experience any significant drop in the repayment rates;&#13;
Institutional Level:&#13;
(d)    PKSF's rigorous selection process, emphasis on proven track record, and starting with&#13;
very small loans to new POs provide adequate safeguards against proliferation of&#13;
institutions. Moreover, even for existing POs the gradual build-up of loans keeps&#13;
default risk manageable;&#13;
(e)    in case of small/medium POs, PKSF proactively encourages them to have management&#13;
succession plans, and in fact includes this as a specific factor while making a decision&#13;
to expand lending to the P0;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
(f)   the large institutions have well-developed governance and management structure, with&#13;
strong presence of donors, and sound internal controls and information processes;&#13;
(g)    Government's ability to politicize management or interfere in PKSF is severely&#13;
curtailed by PKSF's independent Governing Body and separation between Government&#13;
and PKSF built into PKSF's Charter. Moreover, Government's ability to influence&#13;
lending by POs is also very limited. Thus, unlike in the case of its own banks which&#13;
have frequently written off rural loans at Government's request, Government cannot&#13;
exercise its writ on these NGO-based POs. Even if Government was able to force&#13;
PKSF to write off its loans to POs, the latter have so much of their own/donors funds&#13;
involved that they would not be willing to loan write-off at the beneficiary level. Loan&#13;
write-off is anathema to POs, and they have an unwavering policy of on-time&#13;
repayments, except for emergencies;&#13;
(h)   the emphasis on training and institutional development of PKSF being undertaken under&#13;
the Project will enhance its capacity to implement the large credit program;&#13;
(i)    weekly repayments and good information system provide needed early warning to POs&#13;
of impending problems. In addition, PKSF's rigorous practice of requiring monthly&#13;
bank statements and linking disbursements closely to field supervision and repayments&#13;
is a strong safeguard. The strengthening of PKSF's internal audit cell will further&#13;
strengthen the existing risk minimization mechanisms;&#13;
(j)    the loan loss provisions in the system-2 % at PKSF level and 2-3% at the PO level-&#13;
should be able to absorb the expected default risk. Moreover, PKSF's risk of loan&#13;
default is reduced by the cushion provided by low debt:equity ratio of many POs;&#13;
(k)    the razor thin slippage allowance which would make institutions ineligible, e.g. PKSF's&#13;
collection rate has to drop from 99.5% to 98% to become ineligible, is an important&#13;
risk minimization measure.&#13;
Overall:&#13;
(I)    the financial risks are diversified over: a million borrowers, a hundred activities and as&#13;
many institutions, and geographically all over the country;&#13;
(m)   the establishment of a comprehensive impact evaluation system would start providing,&#13;
in 2-3 years, indications about outcomes and benefits of the project. A positive feature&#13;
of the Bangladesh MFIs is their willingness to incorporate impact results into program&#13;
design;&#13;
(n)    while there is always the risk of under disbursement, this would be an attestation that&#13;
the safety features-emphasis on repayments, early warning system, rigorous approach&#13;
of PKSF-are indeed working. Moreover, the credit size has been kept much smaller&#13;
than that proposed by PKSF/POs to avoid "disbursement mentality;" and&#13;
(o)    finally, a major strength of the system is convergence of Project's key goal-poverty&#13;
alleviation-and raison d'etre of all POs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
6.23   The most critical factor to Project success and risk minimization is the Governing Body and&#13;
management of PKSF. As long as PKSF's Governing Body remains independent and continues to&#13;
comprise eminent non-government Bangladeshis with interest in poverty alleviation and PKSF has&#13;
strong professional management, probability of Project success is high-credit disbursement will remain&#13;
closely linked to absorptive capacity and performance. At negotiations, GOB provided assurances that&#13;
PKSF's governance arrangements would remain unchanged and its autonomy protected. During the&#13;
Project implementation period, this aspect would be a major focus of attention of IDA Supervision&#13;
Mission. The most likely worst case scenario is that POs' social welfare objectives overshadow the&#13;
financial sustainability goals, and repayments drop significantly. This has not happened so far for the&#13;
system which has disbursed over $1.5 billion, and there is no reason to believe that it would breakdown&#13;
as a result of a $100 million IDA operation. On balance, the risks of Project-financed PO programs&#13;
deviating from the past pattern is highly unlikely.&#13;
7. AGREEMIENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
7.1   At negotiations, agreements were reached on the following:&#13;
(a)    The institutional eligibility criteria and lending terms and conditions (paras 4.17-4.26);&#13;
(b)    The Subsidiary Loan Agreement between GOB and PKSF, under which IDA/GOB&#13;
funds would be on-lent to PKSF and which spells out the latter's responsibilities under&#13;
the Project and its lending terms and conditions (para 5. 1);&#13;
(c)    Disbursement mechanisms and procedures (paras 5.10-5.11);&#13;
(d)    Project Reporting, Accounting and Auditing arrangements and Project Performance&#13;
Monitoring Indicators (paras 5.12-5.13); and&#13;
(e)    Assurances that PKSF's Governing Body and management would continue to be&#13;
allowed full autonomy in line with its Charter, and that Governing Body membership&#13;
would continue to comprise eminent non-government persons with experience and&#13;
interest in poverty alleviation and microcredit (para 6.23);&#13;
(f)    PKSF and BB Institutional development component, including the TORs and&#13;
implementation timetable (Annex 5);&#13;
7.2    Condition of Effectiveness. A special condition of effectiveness is that the Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreement (para 5.1) has been duly authorized or ratified, and is legally binding upon the GOB and&#13;
PKSF.&#13;
7.3    Recommendation. On the basis of the above agreements, the proposed Project is suitable for&#13;
an IDA Credit of SDR 72.70 million (US$105 million equivalent) to the Government of Bangladesh.&#13;

POVERTY ALLEVIATION MICROFINANCE PROJECT&#13;
THE DIMENSIONS OF POVERTY&#13;
1.     Largely Rural. Bangladesh is predominantly rural; of the 118 million people, over 80% live&#13;
in rural areas. Of these, close to half are below the poverty line, as highlighted by Table I which is&#13;
based on Household Expenditure Survey (HES) data. The table highlights changes in poverty levels&#13;
using two different measures; the Head-Count Index, measuring incidence of poverty, i.e., percentage&#13;
of population below the poverty line', and the Poverty Gap index, measuring depth of poverty&#13;
(Ravallion and Sen, 1995)2. Despite problems in measurement of poverty, the HES data clearly&#13;
demonstrate that poverty has increased. This was largely due to rising poverty in the rural sector,&#13;
which saw steadily worsening poverty measures from 1985/86 onwards. More importantly, the sizable&#13;
increase in the poverty gap index in rural areas from the mid-1980s suggests falling living standards of&#13;
those near the poverty line and the poorest of the poor. In 1991/92, 53% of the rural and 34% of the&#13;
urban people lived below the poverty line.&#13;

1988/89     35.9          8.7              49.7        13.1               47.8       12.5&#13;
1991/92     33.6          8.4               52.9       14.6               49.7       13.6&#13;
2.     The high growth of population is leading to increasing landlessness, and therefore unequal&#13;
access to the most important means of production. In 1990/91, nearly half the rural households were&#13;
landless or near landless (owning less than half an acre of land); 17% of these were completely&#13;
landless. Most of the land sales are made by small owners in distress and purchased by large owners.&#13;
Land is often mortgaged by the poor, which most likely ends up being appropriated. Furthermore, the&#13;
average farm size is also declining. 3&#13;
Poverty line is defined as monthly per capita expenditure which permits a daily intake of 2,122 calories; in&#13;
taka terms, the line was equivalent to a monthly income of Tk 469 and Tk 535 in rural and urban Bangladesh&#13;
respectively.&#13;
2   For a detailed explanation of these measures, see Ravallion and Sen (1 995) "When Method Matters; Toward&#13;
A Resolution of the Debate about Bangladesh's Poverty Measures" Policy Research Working Paper No. 1259,&#13;
The World Bank, Washington D.C.&#13;
3   According to the Agricultural Census of 1982, the average farm size had declined from 3.5 acres in 1971 to&#13;
2.4 acres.&#13;

3.    The nature of rural poverty masks an important differentiation within the poor who fall into&#13;
three distinct bands. Households living just below the poverty line may be characterized as the&#13;
moderate poor. A major proportion of the rural poor, however, live significantly below the poverty&#13;
line, by as much as 40% according to the baseline data of 1989/90. These households constitute the&#13;
extreme poor. The third category of rural poor are technically located above the poverty line. These&#13;
are producers/entrepreneurs, who are not in formal poverty but are highly vulnerable to threats of&#13;
income erosions and consequent descent into moderate or extreme poverty.&#13;
4.     Mostly Women. The burden of poverty is seen to fall disproportionately on women. In 1989-&#13;
90, females on average had a nutritional intake only 88 % of that of males, and 40% of the wage rate&#13;
earned by males. Only 22 % of women were literate compared with 45 % of males. The incomes of&#13;
female-headed households is 40% lower than male-headed households; while 8% of the latter fall&#13;
within the category of extreme poor, the corresponding figure for female-headed households is 33%.&#13;
Female headed households without access to land (nearly 25 % of the landless households) perhaps&#13;
represent the most vulnerable poverty group in Bangladesh. In addition, women have limited access to&#13;
services that can equip them for gainful employment.&#13;
5.    About 86% of women live in rural areas. Women are responsible for most of the post-harvest&#13;
work which takes place in the homestead, and keep livestock, poultry and kitchen gardens; many work&#13;
as part-time or seasonal laborers in the homesteads of others. The economic contribution of women is&#13;
substantial, if largely unacknowledged. The rising incidence of landlessness and declining homestead&#13;
based economic activities have exposed women to serious economic pressures. Consequently, women&#13;
are moving out of the confines of the household in search of jobs. An estimated 7 million rural women&#13;
are seeking employment in a labor market where access has been restricted to date.&#13;
Income Generating Opportunities for the Poor&#13;
6.     GOB has adopted a broad based approach to poverty alleviation, that emphasizes&#13;
macroeconomic stability and economic liberalization, and supports a number of targeted programs. It&#13;
has also assigned top priority to increasing foodgrain production, and more recently to developing&#13;
labor-intensive export industries in order to increase employment and incomes. The present production&#13;
structure, accompanied by sound macro-economic and incentive policies can help increase GDP growth&#13;
rate above 5 %; but even this will be insufficient to productively employ all new entrants to the labor&#13;
force. Robust growth in agriculture could probably absorb about 25 % of new entrants, and industry&#13;
and services another 40%. The remainder would have no choice but to involve themselves in marginal&#13;
activities, swelling the ranks of the very poor, unless action is taken to diversify the rural economy and&#13;
expand targeted efforts to help the landless.&#13;
7.     With agriculture holding little prospects for employment of the growing rural labor force,&#13;
which is expected to reach 100 million by year 2000, a larger share of the rural population will turn to&#13;
the rural non-farm (RNF) sector for employment opportunities. The RNF sector currently employs&#13;
39% of the rural population (Labor Force Survey, 1991), up from 34% in 1984, mostly in&#13;
manufacturing, fisheries, and livestock. Employment in this sector grew at an average annual rate of&#13;
4.1 % between 1984 and 1991. Expansion in RNF production and employment is crucial to promote&#13;
broad-based economic growth since RNF activity is labor-intensive and generates employment for a&#13;
larger number of people than urban industry or agriculture. However, the ability of the landless to&#13;
engage in productive non-farm employment is severely limited by their illiteracy, lack of skills and&#13;
inadequate financial resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
Page 3&#13;
8.     Safety Net and Targeted Programs. GOB is supporting a number of safety net and targeted&#13;
programs which provide employment through labor-intensive infrastructure construction programs, and&#13;
self-employment created through microcredit. These targeted programs for the landless include Food&#13;
for Work (FFW), Vulnerable Groups Development (VGD) and microcredit programs. Rough estimates&#13;
suggest that government's average annual expenditures for these programs has been around Tk 6.5&#13;
billion during the first half of the 1990s. In 1994/95 these programs amounted to about 16% of the&#13;
total budget for the social sectors and human capital development.&#13;
9.     The FFW program uses food resources to provide relief from severe food shortages and&#13;
employment for the landless. Labor is paid in kind to construct needed infrastructure which includes&#13;
unpaved roads, bridges, embankments, culverts, canals etc.&#13;
10.    The VGD program is targeted to destitute women who receive 31 kg. of wheat (or rice) per&#13;
month for a two year period. A savings system (Tk 25 per month), deposited in the beneficiaries'&#13;
individual bank account, enables VGD women to draw a lump sum amount anytime after the eighteen&#13;
months of the program and use it for income generating enterprises. Preference is given to poor&#13;
women with young children, who are heads of households.4 The program helps develop the earning&#13;
capacity of women by providing training in occupational skills, encouraging savings accumulation, and&#13;
providing access to credit. The program is implemented using local government institutions. Between&#13;
1990 and 1995, 0.8 million metric tons of wheat was distributed among 2.4 million VGD women. The&#13;
VGD program has collaborated with BRAC to provide VGD women with training and microcredit, in&#13;
addition to the wheat, adding a new dimension to the intervention. BRAC trains women in various&#13;
activities, especially poultry and silk-worm rearing; its annual microcredit disbursements have&#13;
increased rapidly, from Tk 13 million in 1990, to Tk 162 million in 1995, while recovery rates have&#13;
been close to 100%. The program has so far provided loans to 400,000 women, with average loan per&#13;
borrower of Tk 1,500. Expansion of BRAC's microcredit program for VGD women is an important&#13;
element of the proposed Proiect.&#13;
II.    While targeting the poorest of the poor, the programs for rural works only provide short-term&#13;
succor to the poor in gaining access to income and employment opportunities. These programs have&#13;
been inadequate in sustaining the productive means of the poor and thus have a limited impact on&#13;
permanent escape from poverty. In contrast, the experience of Grameen Bank and other microcredit&#13;
programs shows that when lack of access to affordable credit is a major constraint for self-employment,&#13;
providing credit and other organizational inputs to the poor can help them become self-employed on a&#13;
sustainable basis in familiar income-generating activities.&#13;
These women belong to the poorest 5% of the Bangladesh population. A recent study reveal that half these&#13;
women were unmarried, divorced, widowed or abandoned, and in half the VGD households, there is only one&#13;
income-earning member.&#13;

BANGLADESH&#13;
POVERTY ALLEVIATION MICROFINANCE PROJECT&#13;
FINANCE AND THE POOR&#13;
Overview&#13;
1.    Bangladesh's financial sector comprises the formal financial institutions, (15 commercial and&#13;
specialized banks, and two cooperative networks), the semi-formal institutions (over 120 NGO-based&#13;
MFIs), and the informal institutions (family, friends and money lenders). For the most part, these&#13;
institutions have operated in segmented markets. While little information is available on loans by the&#13;
informal sector, loans outstanding by the formal system amount to Tk 274 billion compared to about Tk&#13;
13 billion by the semi-formal institutions, at end 1994. However, the semi-informal sector provides&#13;
financial services to over 4 million people, compared to a fraction of that number who have had access&#13;
to formal sector credit.&#13;
2.    The informal sector dominates rural finance in Bangladesh. The semi-formal sector occupies&#13;
second place as providers of rural credit, while the formal sector ranks third. In FY94, Grameen Bank&#13;
and other large MFIs provided around Tk 16.60 billion in microcredit, compared with a total volume&#13;
of Tk 11 billion provided by the agricultural banks and nationalized commercial banks (NCBs)&#13;
combined. The informal sector has traditionally met a large share of the credit needs of the rural poor;&#13;
for the most part, the poor borrow to overcome drop in incomes arising from emergencies -- death,&#13;
sickness, natural disasters -- and for consumption expenditures such as dowry, weddings, etc. The high&#13;
interest rates (10 to 15% per month) and the nature of these borrowings -- often in distress and for&#13;
income maintenance -- does not provide the rural poor an opportunity to accumulate savings or fixed&#13;
assets.&#13;
The Formal Sector&#13;
3.     The formal sector comprises of the public sector financial institutions (NCBs and specialized&#13;
banks), private banks', and the Grameen Bank; the latter began as an NGO, but was formally&#13;
established as a specialized bank under a special charter in 1983. Apart from Grameen Bank, few&#13;
other institutions in the formal sector have been a major source of microfinance. Although the&#13;
government owned commercial and specialized banks have a large rural credit program, and some have&#13;
initiated microcredit programs, for the most part their rural credit programs are neither targeted to the&#13;
poor nor do they reach the poor. Moreover, the performance of their rural credit programs is absymal.&#13;
The formal system is under severe strain, due to huge non-performing portfolios, and is unable and&#13;
unwilling to provide microfinance and/or link to the semi-formal system, which is relatively robust and&#13;
growing rapidly. Private commercial banks have largely stayed away from the rural credit sector, due&#13;
to the high cost of intermediation and perceived risk.&#13;
4.     Nationalized Commercial Banks. While the NCB's main focus is on urban-based lending to&#13;
the formal sector, they also provide agricultural credit and microcredit through their rural branch&#13;
network. Agriculture credit (mostly crop loans) disbursement amounted to Tk 4.5 billion in 1994/95;&#13;
collection rates have generally been below 20%. NCB's most significant contribution to the&#13;
microfinance sector was the purchase of about Tk 15 billion of 3-10 years bonds issued by Grameen&#13;
Bank in early 1995. These have been bought by NCBs, because they are eligible for statutory liquidity&#13;
I   Private banks largely operate in urban areas, and mainly lend to the corporate sector.&#13;

requirements, guaranteed by GOB and provided the banks a partial outlet for their excess liquidity at&#13;
that time. Recognizing the immense needs of Grameen and its inability to finance such large amounts&#13;
from the budget, GOB supported this distortionary method of financing.&#13;
5.     Some NCBs have also teamed up with Swanirvar, Bangladesh's oldest NGO, to provide loans&#13;
to their members; however, this program is not working well (para 15). Recently, an NCB has&#13;
provided a loan of about US$1 million to a large MFI, after almost two years of protracted processing&#13;
and only after the MFI offered its premises in Dhaka as collateral and the NCB waived its standard&#13;
requirements that the directors of the MFI provide personal guarantees. A few NCBs have started pilot&#13;
microcredit programs; one of them runs a "Special Investment Scheme" under which it provides non-&#13;
collateralized loans for various non-farm activities, at an annual interest rate of 12% for 3 years.&#13;
Loans averaging Tk 50,000 have been lent so far to over 6,000 entrepreneurs. Another provides small&#13;
loans, largely for the urban poor; as of June 1995, about Tk 3.0 million had been disbursed for 13&#13;
projects.&#13;
6.     Several factors militate against NCB's lending directly to the poor: the predilection of&#13;
commercial banks to shy away from the asset-less, and their operating culture and procedures which&#13;
are geared to the relatively well off, well connected and more vocal segments of rural society.&#13;
Moreover, given that collateralized lending is the norm, banks are very hesitant to make&#13;
uncollateralized loans to MFIs, without full guarantees from government. When NCBs have provided&#13;
microcredit, their rather low lending rates of 16% to the final borrower suggests that these banks are&#13;
making such loans, perhaps to fulfill their social obligations and use underutilized staff in rural&#13;
branches. While they have well-performing microcredit portfolios, overall the portfolio quality of these&#13;
institutions has been very unsatisfactory; a recent World Bank study indicates that overdues (according&#13;
to international standards) are about 50% of the total portfolio. These banks are unlikely to become a&#13;
major player in microcredit on account of the problems noted above. Moreover, their average loan&#13;
sizes are 3-5 times that of MFIs and really not targeted to the poor. These are mainly for small rural&#13;
enterprises and farmers, and rarely include the landless.&#13;
7.     Specialized Banks. The most important and internationally well-known example is the&#13;
Grameen Bank. It is a special purpose financial institution with borrowers and the Government as its&#13;
shareholders. Government equity and loans from public financial institutions forms the bulk of its&#13;
funding base. Bilateral and international donors have also supported it generously. Grameen is the&#13;
largest provider of microcredit in Bangladesh; it has so far disbursed about Tk 48 billion to over 1.9&#13;
million poor. As of June 1994, total loans outstanding stood at 11 billion, and number of borrowers at&#13;
1.8 million.&#13;
8.     The two specialized agricultural banks, Bangladesh Krishi Bank and RAKUB, have not been&#13;
involved in microcredit lending; their focus has been on larger crop sector loans. Total loans&#13;
disbursed, in 1994/95, amount to about Tk 9.6 billion; as in the case of NCBs, recoveries on these&#13;
loans are absymal. Almost 50% of the portfolio is in arrears and collection rates are around 25%.&#13;
Private commercial banks have largely stayed away from the rural credit sector, due to the high cost of&#13;
intermediation.&#13;
The Semi-Formal Sector&#13;
9.     The semi-formal sector comprises largely of NGOs which operate microfinance programs&#13;
targeted to the rural poor. There are over 150 NGOs in Bangladesh offering financial services --&#13;
microcredit and microsavings. Many of these are social welfare non-profit organizations formed to&#13;
&#13;

provide non-lending services such as social empowerment, education, family planning, relief,&#13;
sanitation, and health. Recognizing the importance of stable income and capital accumulation for a&#13;
permanent escape from poverty, these NGOs initiated, in the 1970's, targeted savings and credit&#13;
programs for income generating self employment activities. Over time, these institutions also&#13;
recognized that provision of non-lending services was not, in itself, leading to alleviation of poverty&#13;
and that lending and non-lending services sustain and reinforce each other. MFIs see financial services&#13;
as a vehicle to achieve multiple objectives: enhance the poor's consumption; empower them to access&#13;
health and education services; as a social safety net for the very poor; and as a means to establish a&#13;
permanent income generating asset base for the poor. These programs have grown rapidly and are a&#13;
major source of finance for the poor (Table 1). During the last five years, these NGOs have disbursed,&#13;
on a cumulative basis, about US$280 million to over 2.6 million borrowers. 80% of credit recipients&#13;
are women and repayment rates are mostly above 95 %.&#13;
10.    The microfinance market structure is bipolar; almost 95 % of the market is serviced by&#13;
Grameen Bank and a few large national MFIs with annual credit programs ranging from US$25 - 50&#13;
million. These institutions are professionally managed and staffed, and have so far received a majority&#13;
of their funds as grant from overseas donors. The remaining 5 % share of the market is serviced by&#13;
small, local MFIs with annual credit programs ranging from US$10 - 50 thousand, with flexible&#13;
organizational structures that can be tailored to the availability of funds. The large MFIs usually&#13;
operate on the basis of 3 - 5 year business plans, which are fully funded (mostly by grants from donors&#13;
) at commencement. The small/medium MFIs grow according to the availability of funds. Many of&#13;
the small/medium MFIs rely on the PKSF for financial support, and need to be intensively monitored to&#13;
ensure that they are utilizing funds well. Despite the bipolar market structure, there is increasing&#13;
competition among service providers as the number of institutions increase.&#13;
11.    While there is diversity in the organization/management style and scope of non-lending services&#13;
between large and small MFIs, the basic model of the credit programs is quite similar. A brief&#13;
description of several noteworthy MFIs, some of whom will be participating in the project, is given&#13;
below:&#13;
12.    BRAC began as a relief organization in 1972 and has grown to be the largest NGO in&#13;
Bangladesh. In aggregate, BRAC handled over Tk 2.5 billion in 1995; about 57 % of this was on&#13;
account of disbursements of microcredit loans, with the remaining 43 % on account of expenditures for&#13;
social sector programs (non-formal primary education, health programs etc.); commercial activities and&#13;
relief work. Around two thirds of funding for these programs came from donors, as grants, with the&#13;
remaining from interest income, loan-repayments and sales from commercial activities. BRAC has a&#13;
total full time staff of 14,000. BRAC's credit program comprises its Rural Development Program&#13;
(RDP) and Rural Credit Program (RCP). When BRAC initiates a credit program in a new area, it&#13;
classifies it as an RDP activity. At the start of RDP, the poor are mobilized, organized and trained;&#13;
members have to participate in the mandatory savings program, and reach an acceptable level of&#13;
readiness (usually six months after mobilization) before credit is provided. Once a RDP area&#13;
branch/unit office reaches breakeven status (i.e., interest income covers all financial and administrative&#13;
costs including allocated head office costs, market interest rate2 on funds provided from head office and&#13;
loan loss premium of 2%), it is classified as a Rural Credit Program (RCP) branch; this usually takes&#13;
about four years. In all, there are 115 RDP and 120 RCP branches. Annual credit disbursement of&#13;
2   RCP branches are charged 9%, which is close to the rate for 3-year deposit, even though BRAC's own cost&#13;
of funds are close to zero. This enables RCP branches to subsidize RDP branches.&#13;

RDP and RCP increased from Tk 421 million in FY90 to Tk 2.0 billion in FY95, to almost 1.3 million&#13;
borrowers. Although the recovery rate was around 94% in the early 1990s, it subsequently increased&#13;
to above 98% after 1994. From 1994, the RDP and RCP program together are close to financially&#13;
viability stage (Attachment 1), albeit on subsidized funding basis. BRAC expects to expand its RDP&#13;
and the VGD program (Annex 1, Para 10), and expects that all current RDP branches will reach&#13;
operational viability by year 2000. It has initiated a five year (1996-2000) program amounting to&#13;
US$135 million. This is funded by donors, and would enable BRAC to expand its credit program by&#13;
US$50 million -- from US$90 million in 1995 to US$140 million in 2000 -- and its non-credit program&#13;
by US$81 million. The proposed Project will help BRAC expand its VGD credit programs.&#13;
13.   Proshika. This is the second-largest multi-purpose NGO operating in Bangladesh. In&#13;
aggregate, Proshika handled over Tk 0.6 billion in 1994. About half of this was accounted for&#13;
microcredit disbursement with the remaining on account of expenditures for education, health and&#13;
livestock fisheries programs. Around 60% of funding for these programs came from donors, as grants,&#13;
with the remaining from interest income and loan repayments. Proshika has a staff of 1459. It puts a&#13;
major emphasis on its social development program; credit has only recently become an important part&#13;
of its activities. It provides a variety of services to the poor, both in rural and urban areas, and&#13;
operates through village coordination committees. Proshika's lending program is group and project&#13;
based. The viability of these projects is established by Proshika through pilot programs and field&#13;
research; often, they consist of pioneering activities such as bee-keeping and silk-worm rearing.&#13;
Unlike other NGOs, it extends loans to both farm and non-farm activities and provides intensive&#13;
training to its groups before providing loans; loan disbursements have increased from Tk 120 million in&#13;
FY91 to Tk 423 million in FY95. Recovery rates were low in the early stages of the credit program,&#13;
since social development and not credit was the main objective of Proshika's operations. Since FY94,&#13;
recovery rates have been higher, and cumulative recovery as of FY95 was 96 %. Because of its heavy&#13;
emphasis on training, Proshika's cost of delivery is much higher compared to most MFIs; consequently&#13;
it is unable to fully cover costs from interest income. In FY95, operational viability ratio (interest&#13;
income as % of administrative costs) was 74 %, having increased from 61 % in 1992. Proshika has&#13;
initiated a five year (FY95-99) program amounting to US$75 million funded by donors; about 40% of&#13;
this would go towards expansion of its credit program -- from US$10 million in 1995 to US$37 million&#13;
in 2000, and the remaining for expansion of the non-credit programs. The proposed Project will help&#13;
Proshika further expand its overall credit programs, as well as reduce dependence on subsidies for&#13;
covering credit delivery costs.&#13;
14.   ASA. Unlike BRAC and Proshika, ASA, mainly provides financial services to the rural poor&#13;
and is the third largest MFI in terms of its credit program. In aggregate, ASA handled over Tk 1.2&#13;
billion in 1995. About 90% of this was accounted for microcredit disbursement with the remaining&#13;
10% on account of social sector programs, and relief work. Around 10% of funding for these&#13;
programs came from donors, as grants, with the remaining from savings, loan repayments and interest&#13;
income. ASA has a staff of 2745, with 425 branches/unit offices. ASA does not provide much&#13;
training, and believes that its members are best suited to choose income generation activities in which&#13;
they possess skill and perceive market opportunities. ASA members are given loans within 3 - 6&#13;
months of group organization; its microcredit program has seen phenomenal growth, with annual&#13;
disbursements increasing from Tk 19 million in FY91 to Tk 1,156 million in FY95. ASA's microcredit&#13;
program is different from other MFIs, in that: (a) it pursues a strategy of aggressive growth using&#13;
simple, low-cost unit offices that can be easily replicated; (b) it does not offer too much choice and its&#13;
loan and saving products are standardized in terms of size. Unit offices are required to be financially&#13;
viable within 9 months and operate using 5 staff where most other NGOs would require 12-15 staff.&#13;
Heavy emphasis is put on loan recovery, and recovery rates have been close to 100% since inception.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX2&#13;

ASA's financial performance has been commendable - it has been able to generate profit since 1993,&#13;
largely due to its low-cost operations and, of course low cost of funds. Net surplus is expected to be&#13;
Tk 1 million in 1995, or about 0.5% of loans disbursed. ASA has initiated a five year (1995-1999)&#13;
US$20 million program, funded by donors, to expand its microcredit program by US$16 million, and&#13;
its non-credit program by US$4 million. The proposed Project will help it further expand its&#13;
microcredit programs.&#13;
15.   Swanirvar Bangladesh, operates its microcredit program in conjunction with NCBs.&#13;
Swanirvar is responsible for the costs of group mobilization, loan monitoring and collection, while the&#13;
NCBs provide the finance. However, the bureaucratic procedures and culture of the NCBs has proved&#13;
to be a severe bottleneck in the system, and loans can take almost 6 months to process, compared to the&#13;
two-week approval time by other MFIs. As of July 1995, NCBs had disbursed Tk 0.3 billion to&#13;
600.000 Swanirvar beneficiaries. Repayment rates, however, are only 60%.&#13;
16.   Small/Medium MFIs. These institutions provide both financial and non-financial services; the&#13;
latter, though, are not as significant as the large NGOs because of shortage of funds. Their financial&#13;
services programs have grown significantly over the past few years, many due to continued support&#13;
from the PKSF. While there is little difference in design of the financial programs between large and&#13;
small MFIs, there is considerable difference in management structure. A short hierarchy in the&#13;
management structure and low personnel costs help increase cost-effectiveness and facilitate the move&#13;
to sustainability. While precise numbers on disbursements by small/medium MFIs are difficult to&#13;
obtain, PKSF estimates that field disbursements by its MFI borrowers increased from Tk 44 million in&#13;
1991-92, to Tk 675 million in 1994-95, indicating the high magnitude of growth being experienced by&#13;
small/medium MFIs. Available rough information suggests that most operate at or below operational&#13;
viability stage (Attachment 1), because of small size of programs.&#13;
17.   In addition to the above NGO institutions, there are two cooperative networks operated under&#13;
the Bangladesh Rural Development Board (BRDB) and Bangladesh Sambaya Bank Limited; they have&#13;
mainly provided agricultural credit. In addition, the BRDB operates six income generating&#13;
projects/programs targeted to the landless, for self-employment. These programs have been as&#13;
successful as the NGO programs in terms of outreach and repayment rates. Of these, the Rural&#13;
Development 12 (RD-12) project, funded by Canadian International Development Agency, is the single&#13;
largest program and has been very successful. As of June 30, 1995, RD-12 provided Tk 2.2 billion&#13;
to 521,000 members, with recovery rate as high as 95%. Canadian support for expansion is contingent&#13;
on the program being spun out of BRDB and operated as a separate, autonomous MFI.&#13;
Operational Features of MFIs&#13;
18.   The MFIs' basic model has the following key features:&#13;
*   it is targeted to the landless/asset-less, specifically those who own less than 0.5 acres of&#13;
land. Some MFIs also use an income criteria, including only those people with annual&#13;
incomes less than Tk 15,000 (US$375).&#13;
* all borrowers have to be part of a group whose size ranges from 20-30, with group&#13;
members guaranteeing each other's loans.&#13;
* women borrowers are given preference. In fact, most MFIs only lend to women. Overall,&#13;
women borrowers make up over 80% of the total borrowers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 7&#13;
*  loans are collateral-free, and have a maturity of 50 weeks, with weekly repayments after 3-&#13;
5 weeks grace period. Weekly repayments ensure that repeater loans are not paying the&#13;
prior loan. As a result of the relending opportunity arising from weekly repayment feature,&#13;
with every additional Tk 100 available to it, an MFI can make loans of about Tk 150-200&#13;
during the year.&#13;
*  savings is an integral part of the program. A borrower has to save regularly and most&#13;
MFIs have mandatory weekly savings ranging from Tk 5-10 (US$12-20 cents ).&#13;
*  borrowers have full freedom to choose the activity to be financed by the loan. Some MFIs&#13;
provide training to support these activities.&#13;
*  groups meet regularly once a week. These meetings are used to conduct weekly&#13;
savings/loans transaction and are a focal point to ensure tight sense of community&#13;
participation. Apart from loan transactions, social issues are discussed and training on&#13;
health, basic literacy and other social aspects is often provided.&#13;
i  all financial transactions are done in presence of the entire group to enhance transparency&#13;
and self-monitoring.&#13;
*  as long as borrowers repay on time, they are assured of repeater loans, generally of a&#13;
higher amount. This assurance is critical to the excellent repayment performance. The&#13;
basic premise is that the poor need to have continuous access to credit for a period of 8-10&#13;
years to accumulate enough savings/assets (net of debt) to escape from the poverty trap and&#13;
maintain reasonable consumption once credit is withdrawn. All MFIs start with a small&#13;
loan (US$50-75) and provide repeater loans of increasing amounts as long as repayment of&#13;
earlier loan is satisfactory. Most MFIs have upper loan limits of US$200-300, but few&#13;
have a policy to "graduate" a borrower from the program; since large loan borrowers are&#13;
low risk - having been in the system for a few years - and provide ability for cross-&#13;
subsidy.&#13;
19.    Most of the credit provided by MFIs finances rural non-farm production. This includes&#13;
activities such as poultry farming, petty trade and shopkeeping, beef fattening, pottery, and other&#13;
related activities; mainly activities with short gestation and daily sales. Non-farm activities are&#13;
performed largely by the landless, especially women. However, a number of agricultural workers&#13;
undertake non-farm production in the slack seasons, or to supplement their incomes. Some of these&#13;
activities (such as trade and commerce, poultry farming) are highly productive, while others are low-&#13;
productive activities which provide self-employment and primarily help supplement the family income.&#13;
These activities require small, short -term loans of the kind provided by MFIs, and their growth has&#13;
been seriously hindered by the limited availability of this type of finance.&#13;
20.    MFIs use fairly comprehensive loan forms to select beneficiaries. In the absence of land&#13;
records and objective means tests, the selection is largely subjective. However, the self-selection&#13;
process ensures that those who enter the program are truly credit constrained, and are unable to tap&#13;
formal sources of finance. The following features of the program also provide a reasonable degree of&#13;
assurance that only the poor get the loans: very small loan sizes and high interest rates; rigorous&#13;
enforcement of repayment; weekly meetings; NGO staff's knowledge of local communities and low&#13;
probability of the better-off to subject themselves to the rigors of the program and be seen sitting with&#13;
the poor in open meetings. Despite these features, the programs often do not reach the very poorest,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 8&#13;
who are usually migrant/destitute, and do not possess the ability to make weekly repayments (which in&#13;
some cases need to be made from other sources).&#13;
21.    All MFIs are multipurpose, providing both credit and non-credit services. Not only there is a&#13;
wide range in the scope of services offered by each MFI, there is also significant variation in the&#13;
microcredit programs pursued by each. While the basic model is similar, there are a wide range with&#13;
differing objectives and methodologies. At one end of the spectrum there are institutions like Grameen&#13;
Bank and ASA, where credit activities dominate the institutions' business. At the other end of the&#13;
spectrum are MFIs like BRAC and Proshika, who believe that an integrated strategy, focused on&#13;
community and human resource development is necessary to assist the landless. Both strategies have&#13;
worked well, though the latter has higher costs, and diverse organizations have all experienced&#13;
tremendous success in terms of outreach and repayment performance. 3&#13;
Sustainability Trade-Off&#13;
22.    Table 2 below provides on indicative basis trade-offs between key variables of sustainability--&#13;
unit loan size and horizontal outreach -- for three institutions, namely BRAC, Grameen and ASA. The&#13;
table shows the increase needed in unit loan size for existing borrowers, to maintain breakeven status&#13;
under different scenarios for horizontal outreach and unit loan size of new borrowers. The Table&#13;
shows trade-offs among three variables: % increase in unit loan of existing borrowers; % increase in&#13;
new borrowers; and loan size of new borrower as % of loan size to existing borrower. New loans are&#13;
usually much smaller, 25-30% of loans of current borrowers.&#13;

23.    Thus in the case of BRAC, the table shows (in bold numbers) that if BRAC wants to increase&#13;
outreach by 40%, and unit loan size of new borrowers is 20% of loan size of existing borrowers, to&#13;
maintain financial breakeven BRAC has to increase unit loan size of existing borrowers by 151 %. If&#13;
outreach was higher than 40%, BRAC would incur losses unless loan size increases for new and old&#13;
3   Outreach refers to the central purpose of microfinance - to provide large number of people with access to&#13;
credit.&#13;

borrowers. In general, to maintain breakeven: (a) the higher the unit loan size of new borrowers, the&#13;
lower unit loan size of existing borrowers has to increase; and (b) the higher the outreach, the higher&#13;
has be the unit loan size of existing borrowers. The trade-offs for Grameen and ASA follow similar&#13;
pattern, except that since they have operating profits, the unit loan size increases are much lower than&#13;
BRAC (which has operating losses) for the same changes in other variables.&#13;
The Informal Sector&#13;
24.    Informal markets continue to be the primary source of credit for a large proportion of the rural&#13;
population; it is also lender of the last resort for many. Contrary to popular opinion, informal lending&#13;
activity is not dominated by money lenders; a majority of transactions are between friends and relatives&#13;
at zero or nominal rates of interest. Also, a large part of informal loans are for "productive" purposes,&#13;
including capital investments. A recent World Bank Survey found that the overall interest rate in the&#13;
informal sector was 48%; if only interest bearing loans were counted, the rate was as high as 106%.&#13;
Not all loans are recovered on time, but almost 100% of the loans are eventually repaid (within 3&#13;
years). The average recovery rate was estimated to be 62 %, with small borrowers showing better&#13;
4&#13;
repayment.&#13;

Attachment 1&#13;
THE CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
1.     The term "program sustainability" means the ability of a microfinance program to continue&#13;
operating as a development finance institution for the rural poor. Since these programs often use&#13;
loanable funds from various sources to finance productive activities, they can only sustain their&#13;
operations if they remain financially sound. On the other hand, since these programs function as&#13;
programs for the poor, they can be sustainable only if the benefits that the poor receive from program&#13;
participation result in a sustainable reduction in poverty. The main determinants of program&#13;
sustainability are financial, economic, and institutional viability of the MFI as well as of its borrowers.&#13;
2.     An MFI's credit program is operationally viable once interest income covers direct costs&#13;
(salaries, administration, etc.) of credit delivery. It isfinancially viable once interest income exceeds&#13;
direct costs of credit delivery, bad debt expenses and financial expenses, which are often subsidized. It&#13;
is defined as economically viable once interest income exceeds all operating costs including bad debt&#13;
expense and the economic cost of funds (the opportunity cost). Finally, an MFI is institutionally viable&#13;
if it has effective and well-institutionalized procedures for ensuring administration and management&#13;
succession, so that it is not dependent on the leadership of a particular person. Institutional viability&#13;
also depends on the viability of the borrowers.&#13;
3.     MFIs' financial and economic viability depends on the level of subsidies they require. There&#13;
are two types of subsidy - financial and economic. Financial subsidy results when a program is not&#13;
cost effective (or cannot break even), and is measured by the losses made by the MFI. Economic&#13;
subsidy results if the cost of funds is cheaper than the opportunity cost, i.e., the market cost of funds&#13;
and one way of measuring it is by calculating the subsidy dependence index. Many credit programs&#13;
receive both kinds of subsidy and this is a concern for their long-run sustainability.&#13;

POVERTY ALLEVIATION MICROFINANCE PROJECT&#13;
THE APEX AGENCY: POVERTY FOUNDATION (PKSF)&#13;
A. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
History, Legal Framework, and Relationship with the Government&#13;
1.    The Poverty Foundation (i.e., the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation or PKSF) was established&#13;
in May 1990 under the Companies Act of 1913 as an autonomous and non-profit organization charged&#13;
with "helping the poor, the landless, and the assetless in order to enable them to gain access to&#13;
resources for their productive self-employment, to encourage them to undertake activities of income&#13;
generation and poverty alleviation for enhancing their quality of life" (PKSF's Memorandum of&#13;
Association). The formation of PKSF was prompted by the fact that a number of small NGOs were&#13;
engaged in promoting income generating activities within their local areas in Bangladesh. While many&#13;
of these NGOs were competently managed, they generally suffered from a perennial shortage of funds.&#13;
Thus, PKSF was formed with a view to financing such NGOs. In support of this objective, PKSF&#13;
received an initial grant of Tk 32 million from the GOB. Since then, it has received additional grants&#13;
from the GOB for a total of Tk 750 million; very recently, it has received additional Tk 200 million, as&#13;
GOB's contribution to this Project. The only other source of funds has been net income. At end 1995&#13;
the total equity of PKSF was Tk 844 million, of which Tk 94 million (or 11 %) was generated by net&#13;
income and the remainder from grants from GOB.&#13;
2.    The principal objectives of PKSF, as mentioned in the Memorandum of Association of the&#13;
Foundation, are to help the poor by providing them with resources for the creation of productive self-&#13;
employment opportunities. This is achieved through: (a) provision of credit to various partner&#13;
organizations (POs) that are engaged in promoting such income-generation activities for the poor; (b)&#13;
institutional strengthening of these organizations; (c) encouraging new ideas, generating new&#13;
technologies for poverty alleviation, and initiating and undertaking research activities; and (d)&#13;
developing proper management information systems, so that the poverty alleviation activities may be&#13;
monitored and evaluated in a regular manner.&#13;
Management&#13;
3.    A General Body provides over-all policy guidance, approves the annual budget, and reviews&#13;
the annual report and audited accounts of PKSF. The General Body may have up to 25 members (with&#13;
up to 15 members being nominated by government from government employees, NGOs, etc.)&#13;
appointed on the basis of their record of service with respect to poverty alleviation and income&#13;
generation activities for the poor; the other 10 members may be from POs and/or private individuals.&#13;
4.    In addition, there is a seven member Governing Body, comprising the Chairman, Managing&#13;
Director and five other members. The Chairman and two other members are appointed by the&#13;
Government; the former, however, cannot be a serving official. In the past, the Managing Director&#13;
was appointed by the Government, but in late-1995, PKSF's Memorandum of Articles was changed to&#13;
give its Governing Body the full authority. The other three members are selected by the private sector&#13;
members of the General Body, and represent knowledge professionals with interest in the field of NGO&#13;
activities and poverty alleviation. The Governing Body currently includes Professor Yunus, of&#13;
Grameen Bank. All the shares of PKSF are held, equally, by the seven Body members. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 2&#13;
Governing Body reviews progress, set policies, and take decisions as needed on matters related to the&#13;
registration of new Partner Organizations, changes in maximum staffing levels, and so on. It also&#13;
reviews and approves the annual budget and the annual report prior to their being presented to the&#13;
General Body.&#13;
5.     The General Body and the Governing Body thus provide the control framework within which&#13;
the Managing Director carries out his responsibilities as the Chief Executive Officer of PKSF.&#13;
Organization&#13;
6.    In undertaking his duties, the Managing Director is supported by two General Managers, one&#13;
for Operations and the other for Administration. The Operations wing of PKSF is responsible for the&#13;
initial screening of organizations applying for registration as POs, the initial screening of loan&#13;
applications, for authorizing disbursements, and for tracking scheduled vs. actual repayments. The key&#13;
functionaries in Operations are the Loan Officers who maintain close linkage with their POs through&#13;
regular field visits. The Administration wing includes separate sections for Finance, Administration&#13;
and Internal Audit. PKSF has recently established a new unit, "Large PO Window," to handle the&#13;
lending and suspension related to large POs.&#13;
Staff&#13;
7.     As of December 1995, PKSF had a total of 72 staff, consisting of 37 professional staff (of&#13;
whom 16 are responsible for field visits) and 35 support staff. The compensation package offered by&#13;
PKSF is geared to attract bright and motivated young graduates, being 50% higher than the public&#13;
sector and 20% higher than other large NGOs in the country. Although the salary structure is&#13;
competitive, there is a need to introduce a comprehensive training program for staff.&#13;
B. OPERATIONS&#13;
Policies&#13;
8.     The operations of PKSF are governed by written policy guidelines that relate to (a) credit terms&#13;
and conditions, and (b) rules and modalities concerning final borrowers.&#13;
9.     With respect to credit terms, the guidelines currently set minimum interest rates charged to the&#13;
POs (2%), and rates charged by POs to the final borrowers (16%). PKSF current rates range from 3-&#13;
4.5 % p.a., with maturity period of three years. Even though POs need long-term funds, PKSF&#13;
provides three year loans to ensure adequate accountability and monitoring of fund use; at the same&#13;
time, it has a policy of automatically providing repeater loans of higher amounts, as long as the&#13;
repayment rate is satisfactory (i.e., 95 % +). Loans by POs to the final borrowers are to be repaid&#13;
within one year.&#13;
10.   With respect to final beneficiaries, the guidelines specify that lending by POs must be basically&#13;
directed towards borrower groups, and also describe the basic rules for these groups. These rules state&#13;
that each group must have at least 5 members, and that these members must be basically "assetless-&#13;
landless" (that is, they must include only people with families having total assets not exceeding one&#13;
acre of land in that area). Each group must elect a Chairperson and Secretary who may liaise with the&#13;
PO on behalf of the group. The group must meet weekly, with attendance required of all members.&#13;
In addition, potential borrowers must deposit at least two taka as saving deposit in weekly meetings,&#13;
these being kept in a bank account in the name of the group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX3&#13;
Page 3&#13;
11.   It has established a prudent exposure limit; maximum loan to a PO cannot, usually, exceed&#13;
10% of available funds. In addition it follows a conservative policy for first-time POs by starting with&#13;
a small loan and gradually increasing loan sizes once there is a satisfactory track record. For example,&#13;
in regard to the 18 POs approved in FY95, the loan size ranged from Tk 100,000 (for 12 POs) to Tk&#13;
1.2 million. As of June 1995, the average loan outstanding per PO amounted to about Tk 24 million,&#13;
while the size distribution was as follows: 57% of loans, by number, were below Tk 2 million, 34%&#13;
between Tk 2-5 million and remaining 9% higher; loans in the last category accounted for 60% of&#13;
outstanding loans with the maximum loan outstanding being Tk 80 million.&#13;
Activities&#13;
12.   PKSF's activities in support of it's over-all objectives noted above have to-date largely focused&#13;
on ensuring a rigorous screening of applications from various NGOs for registration as Partner&#13;
Organizations, and the subsequent processing of loan approvals, disbursements and repayments. This&#13;
work involves regular field visits by loan officers. In addition, PKSF has provided technical assistance&#13;
towards the institutional strengthening of the POs (this last being primarily focused towards ensuring a&#13;
uniform system of accounting and controls for the credit activities of the POs). There is however a&#13;
need to strengthen management information systems to ensure transparency, provide early warning on&#13;
portfolio problems and information with respect to poverty alleviation activities.&#13;
Procedures&#13;
13.    PKSF's credit operations center around the loan officers in the Operations wing, each of whom&#13;
has clear responsibility with respect to individual POs. Organization seeking to register as POs&#13;
complete a comprehensive application form, providing information about their own financial status as&#13;
well as the status of the borrower groups they service. This is supplemented by field visits by a loan&#13;
officer to verify the information provided. The Managing Director and the General Managers control&#13;
credit operations by forming a Loan Committee, which includes the Loan Officer in addition to these&#13;
three senior managers, and which reviews PO registration and loan applications forwarded by the Loan&#13;
Officer. Applications approved by the Loan Committee are presented to the Governing Body for final&#13;
approval. POs are required to conduct all transactions, of PKSF funded programs through banks,&#13;
submit monthly bank statements and MIS reports. Loans are approved on the basis of POs' annual&#13;
needs, but disbursed, generally at intervals of 1-2 months, after field supervision and bank statements&#13;
confirms that the latter transaction has been satisfactorily used Loan officers make field supervision&#13;
visits once every two or three months.&#13;
Overall&#13;
14.    PKSF's overall operating policies and procedures are quite satisfactory. Its credit approval&#13;
policies are sound and conservative, credit supervision intensive, accounting/MIS systems reasonably&#13;
satisfactory and its own external audit quite comprehensive. PKSF's main focus of attention with&#13;
regard to its borrowers is on loan collections (which have been over 99.8% since inception),&#13;
satisfactory bookkeeping of disbursements and repayments, routing of PKSF financed transactions&#13;
through banks and ensuring that loans made to the target group. To further strengthen its monitoring,&#13;
and internal accountability capabilities, PKSF has recently established an Internal Audit Cell.&#13;
15.   While PKSF encourages its POs to, at least, fully cover the recurring administrative/funding&#13;
costs from operating income, and also imposes a minimum lending rate of 16% to ensure that POs do&#13;
not lend below commercial bank rates and promote cost coverage from operations, it does not impose&#13;
any specific performance or sustainability target. PKSF's main objective is to ensure accountability of&#13;
its funds, and as long as POs meet its stringent requirements for repayment, accounting and targeting,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
ANNEX&amp;3&#13;
Page 4&#13;
PKSF neither monitors not imposes its view on POs product mix, cross-subsidization of non-lending&#13;
services from lending profits or lending services from grants and other income, loan pricing and loan&#13;
loss reserve policies, level of mandatory savings, separation of accounts for different services, etc.&#13;
PKSF encourages, but does not mandate, POs who have outside sources of income to set aside a&#13;
portion of interest income as reserves. Considering the pervasive loan default culture, the high priority&#13;
it attaches to loan collections is well-placed and should remain as its predominant concern. In addition,&#13;
but without sacrificing the above noted emphasis, it needs to pay attention to issues of sustainability and&#13;
its own role as an apex institution. Thus, a major institutional development objective of the Project is&#13;
to enhance PKSF's financial planning and monitoring capabilities, incorporate forward looking&#13;
performance targets in PKSF's credit policies, and strengthen accounting/auditing standards of&#13;
small/medium POs.&#13;
C. PAST AND PROJECTED OPERATIONS&#13;
16.   The past (FY91-95) and projected (FY96-2005) financial results are given in Tables 1 to 5.&#13;
Lending&#13;
17.   PKSF has so far enlisted 124 POs as borrowers. A brief description of a few representative&#13;
POs is given in Attachment 1. PKSF's gross disbursements to POs rose from Tk 3 million in FY91&#13;
(second year of operations for PKSF) to Tk 26 million in FY92 and to Tk 302 million in FY95. Credit&#13;
disbursement grew at an average rate of 63 % between FY93-95. Loans outstanding as a percentage of&#13;
total assets rapidly increased from 1 % in FY91 to 9% in FY92 and stood at 54% in 1995. The&#13;
remaining are current assets, mainly term deposits in banks which yield about 6%. As of June 30,&#13;
1995, loans outstanding (net of a Loan Loss provision of Tk 3 million that was applied for the first time&#13;
in 1995) was Tk 456 million, or over a three-fold increase from 1993.&#13;
18.   Disbursement are projected to increase from about Tk 500 million in FY96 to Tk 2.4 billion in&#13;
FY2000, as a result of the IDA credit, at an average rate of 50% per annum. About 63 % of the&#13;
disbursement would be on account of small/medium POs, with the remaining on account of the large&#13;
POs, e.g., ASA, BRAC, etc. As a result of this lending, total assets will increase from Tk 1 billion in&#13;
FY96 to Tk 6 billion in FY2000. Total loan outstanding as a percentage of total assets will grow from&#13;
73% in FY96 to 82% in FY2000. Loans to large POs are projected to grow from zero, currently, to&#13;
over Tk 2.3 billion, or about 40% of the total loan portfolio. For the FY2001-2005 it is expected that&#13;
the level of disbursement will increase by 20% a year.&#13;
Financial Performance&#13;
19.   PKSF's total income doubled from Tk 12 million in FY91 to Tk 26 million in FY95. The&#13;
share of interest income in total income grew from 0 in FY92 to 39% (Tk 10 million) by FY95 while&#13;
the share of income from current assets (i.e., interest income on deposits) declined from 100% to 61 %&#13;
during the same period. Operating expenses as a percentage of average assets came down from 3.5 %&#13;
in FY91 to 1.4% in FY95. Net income dropped from Tk 29 million to Tk 14 million between FY92-&#13;
95; this was caused by the drop in income from current assets (resulting from liquidating deposits and&#13;
increasing lending ) and a first time loan loss provision of Tk 3 million in FY95.&#13;
20.   As a result of expanding loan portfolio, 5 % interest rate on loans to large POs, and increasing&#13;
yield on loans to small POs (as cumulative loans to these increase lending rate shifts to higher rate&#13;
slabs), total income would increase from Tk 46 million in FY96 to Tk 205 million in FY2000. At the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -                                ANX&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 5&#13;
same time, total expenses would increase from Tk 30 million in FY96 to Tk 140 million in FY2000; a&#13;
large part of the increase is on account of higher loan loss provisioning and interest expense on IDA&#13;
loans. Total expenses as percentage of assets remains at around 3 % between in FY96 to FY2000.&#13;
Administrative expenses as percentage of assets declines from 1.2% in FY96 to 0.6% FY2000. Net&#13;
income initially drops from Tk 16 million in FY96 to Tk 7 million in FY97, due to higher provision,&#13;
and scaling - up costs in these years, but thereafter gradually increase to Tk 65 million in FY2000 and&#13;
Tk 204 million in 2005.&#13;
21.    The IDA credit increases PKSF's debt to equity ratio from 0 in FY96 to 3.7 in FY2000.&#13;
Return on average assets drops from 2% in FY95 to 1.3% in FY2000, as net income does not grow as&#13;
fast as the asset base but increases to 1.6% by FY2005. Finally, return on equity increases from 1.6%&#13;
in FY96 to 5.1 % in FY2000 and reaches 9.7 % by FY2005.&#13;
22.   Longer term projections indicate that, after FY2005 PKSF could start to pay higher rates on&#13;
incremental borrowings and that by 2015 it could pay 8% interest rate (7% higher than at present and&#13;
2% higher than average cost of funds of the banking system) on all its borrowed funds and earn a&#13;
satisfactory return on assets, while raising the average lending rate only 4% -- from the 4.4% in&#13;
FY2000 to 8.5 % in 2015. Because of higher cost of funding, the average interest expense (as % of&#13;
borrowed finds) increases from 1.0% in FY2000 to 6.3% in FY2015. The favorable Debt:Equity ratio&#13;
which hovers around 7:1 beyond FY2005 would enable PKSF to operate on a thin interest margin and&#13;
yet earn a satisfactory return on assets.&#13;

POVERTY ALLEVIATION MICROFINANCE PROJECT&#13;
SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT OF MICROFINANCE PROGRAMS:&#13;
A SUMMARY OF FINDINGS&#13;
1.    Most large MFIs have conducted in-depth analyses of the impact of their programs on the&#13;
borrowers. Most of these evaluations have been performed by reputed international experts, using a&#13;
large sample of the borrowers, and comparing progress in various socio-economic indicators against a&#13;
control group of non-borrowers. Some of the findings from these studies, and those done by the Bank&#13;
staff, are summarized below. As the MFIs use different approaches, their evaluations are also&#13;
different in design and are not comparable. Notwithstanding weaknesses in methodology (e.g.,&#13;
endogeneity bias, inability to capture dropouts vs. graduates, difficulties in sampling a suitable control&#13;
group, lack of time-series data, etc.), these independent studies have revealed that participation in&#13;
microfinance programs yields not only material benefits, but important social benefits to the rural poor.&#13;
Bank Study&#13;
2.    A more rigorous household and individual data-based study has recently been completed by&#13;
World Bank and BIDS (Khadker and others, 1996; Khandker and Chaudhry, 1995; Pitt and Khandker,&#13;
1995; Rahman and Khandker, 1995). The results show that microfinance programs place their&#13;
programs in poorer areas and that program participation among the poor is self-selective. Thus,&#13;
Grameen Bank program covers villages where 65.3 % of households belong to target groups (having&#13;
less than 50 or less decimal of land) compared to 52.1 % of target households in village without such a&#13;
program and that the program participation rate among the target group in Grameen Bank villages is&#13;
only 44.3% (Table 1).&#13;

3.     Microimpact results shown in Table 2 indicate that microfinance program such as Grameen&#13;
Bank has desirable impacts on the poor and that the program impacts are statistically different for male&#13;
and female borrowers and that women benefit from program participation. For example, for those&#13;
borrowers with average loan size (about Tk 3,500), a 1% increase in their loan size would: (a)&#13;
increases per capita consumption (a weekly increase of 4.3 % among female borrowers and 1.8 %&#13;
increase among male borrowers); (b) boys' schooling (7.2% increase among male borrowers and 6.1%&#13;
increase among female borrowers), and girls' schooling (3.0% increase among male borrowers and&#13;
4.7% increase among female borrowers); and (c) reduce recent (over the last five years) fertility of&#13;
women aged 15-49 (7.4% reduction for male borrowing and 3.5% reduction for female borrowing).&#13;
Thus, the impact on fertility and boys' schooling is more pronounced for male than for female&#13;
borrowers, while the impact of borrowing on household per capita consumption and girls schooling is&#13;
more pronounced for female than for male borrowers. When poverty (measured on the basis of per&#13;
capita consumption requirement) is evaluated based on the weekly per capita consumption increase of&#13;
female borrowing, the results indicates that an average female borrower of Grameen Bank can take the&#13;
family out of poverty within five years of borrowing, provided that the same percentage increase of&#13;
consumption is maintained. This study also shows that women benefit from program participation&#13;
mainly through increasing labor supply to cash-income earning activities (by 10.4%) and holding more&#13;
nonland assets (by 19.9%). Also the program participants household assets increased by 140-250% as&#13;
a result of receiving repeated loans.&#13;
4.     Microfinance programs have also created positive externality in the village economy (Table 3).&#13;
Microfinance supports mainly nonfarm production and thus, the nonfarm income of an average&#13;
household is 14.8% higher in Grameen Bank villages than nonprogram villages with a resulting 10.2&#13;
increase of average household total annual income. Rural wage workers also benefit from program&#13;
placement. The average daily wage rate is at least 5.2% higher in Grameen Bank villages than in no&#13;
program villages. Grameen Bank's subsidized finance operation through microfinance lending to the&#13;
poor has also generated positive externality in the case of both informal lending (reduction of 54.5%)&#13;
and informal interest (annual) rate (a reduction 8.0%). These results clearly show that a microfinance&#13;
program such as Grameen Bank has not only reached the poor (more than 2 million borrowers) but also&#13;
helped reduce poverty among the borrowers and generated positive externality in the village economy.&#13;
Nevertheless, because of some 25 % coverage of poor among the target households in rural Bangladesh&#13;
by these niicrofinance programs, the overall positive effect of microfinance programs on rural poverty&#13;
&#13;

reduction is yet marginal. But there is still room for further expansion of microfinancing through&#13;
increased outreach and horizontal program expansion.&#13;

5.     The above study found that in addition to its financial services, Grameen Bank has devised and&#13;
implemented diverse programs to promote social development. It encourages members to open nursery&#13;
schools at its centers, distributes seeds and seedlings to promote gardening and planting, and helps its&#13;
members improve health , nutrition, and productivity by encouraging them to practice "sixteen&#13;
decisions "'. Overall, the growth recorded for various aspects of this program reflects a remarkable&#13;
achievement in social development, affecting the living and social conditions of its members and the&#13;
environment ( Table 4).&#13;

These include guiding rules such as "we will keep our families small", "we will build and use pit-latrines"&#13;
etc., which define the social behavior expected of all Grameen members.&#13;

6.     Proshika evaluated its borrowers, using external evaluators, on various social and economic&#13;
empowerment indicators, that were designed to capture major aspects of the intended impacts of&#13;
Proshika's empowerment programs. The survey used a random sample from two separate groups:&#13;
project participants and non-participants. These two groups were surveyed twice over the period.&#13;
7.     The survey found that female Proshika members tended to have higher levels of literacy than&#13;
their non-Proshika counterparts. Children of these members also demonstrated higher levels of&#13;
literacy, partly due to the Proshika non-formal primary education program. Proshika members were&#13;
more likely to consult health practitioners, and received significantly higher levels of health education&#13;
and training. They had higher access to pit latrines and water sealed latrines than their counterparts.&#13;
Female members were more likely to use contraceptives even though they had the same access to&#13;
supplies as non-members. Infant mortality rates were lower among Proshika members as the mothers&#13;
were getting better nutrition, and the percentage of dowryless marriages among Proshika members was&#13;
higher (Table 5).&#13;

BRAC&#13;
8.     BRAC's impact assessment conducted in 1993-94 did not use a "before and after" approach;&#13;
instead it analyzed the economic and social status of different categories of RDP members (Annex 2,&#13;
para 12) according to their length of membership. The results indicate that BRAC members are&#13;
consistently moving along the path to greater wealth and expenditure, according to loan size and&#13;
membership age. Moreover, BRAC's RDP is impacting on less well-off households to a comparatively&#13;
greater degree than better-off households; and the focus on female members is more effective in&#13;
bringing benefits to BRAC's target group than would be the case with a higher proportion of male&#13;
membership.&#13;
9.     Changes in nature of household assets, along with increases in the monetary value of capital&#13;
suggest both greater economic security and an improved standard of living for "older" members of the&#13;
RDP (Table 6). This enhanced security is confirmed by reduced seasonal fluctuations in income,&#13;
expenditure, food consumption, and stocks, for these members who joined RDP more that two and a&#13;

half years ago and have more than Tk 7,500 of cumulative RDP loans. Moreover, there is a tendency&#13;
to withdraw from the informal credit market, and the use of loans for consumption or hardship&#13;
purposes declines with length of membership.&#13;
10.    The study reveals that BRAC membership has brought about gradual changes in women's lives.&#13;
After receiving loans, women's status within the household has increased, and some have experienced&#13;
greater mobility, and have more control over the household income. When BRAC has provided&#13;
support to women close to their homes, they have productively used the loans themselves, without the&#13;
assistance of male members of the household.&#13;
11.    A separate survey of the IVGD program revealed that the women in these programs have&#13;
higher cash incomes, purchased a higher quantity of consumer and production durables, and tended to&#13;
send a higher proportion of their girls to school than women in other targeted programs.&#13;

ASA&#13;
12.    An evaluation of ASA's program in 1993/94 revealed that apart from conducting a profitable&#13;
credit operation, ASA has made a significant impact on the lives of its mostly female members. It runs&#13;
several socio-economic programs, such as the Education for Empowerment program, the Human&#13;
Development Training program, and the Integrated Health program. For example, the Integrated&#13;
Health Program comprises sub-projects in nutrition improvement, feeding of malnourished children,&#13;
and traditional birth attendant training. Interviews with participants in these programs revealed that&#13;
their total food consumption increased, the nutritional status of malnourished children improved, and&#13;
most of the beneficiaries were aware of maintaining personal hygiene.&#13;
PKSF's Small/Medium POs&#13;
13.    Table 7 shows the results of a study conducted by PKSF that covered 14 POs. Apart from&#13;
increases in incomes to the borrowers, the PKSF study revealed that there is significant improvement in&#13;
certain social indicators, such as the ability to write names, children's school enrollment, and use of&#13;
drinking water among PO members. While there is a need to put in place an analytically robust system&#13;
to regularly track impact of microfinance programs, they have, in general, been successful in&#13;
expanding opportunities for self employment, increasing labor force participation of women, and&#13;
shifting borrowers away from the moneylenders to microcredit programs.&#13;

POVERTY ALLEVIATION MICROFINANCE PROJECT&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION PLAN AND PROJECT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;
A. MONITORING AND EVALUATION PLAN&#13;
1.    The proposed Project would be monitored and evaluated from the perspectives of input, output&#13;
and impact. Input evaluation would focus on whether the required resources are in place to implement&#13;
the program activities and services. Input information would be monitored and assessed continuously&#13;
(reported quarterly, semi-annually, or annually) to identify problems in the delivery of inputs so that&#13;
they may be resolved before causing significant delays in implementation. Output evaluation would&#13;
focus on the immediate results of activities, as demonstrated, for example, increase in the number of&#13;
borrowers. This evaluation would be undertaken annually or semi-annually (depending on specific&#13;
output indicator). Impact evaluation would focus on program outcomes in terms of the socio-economic&#13;
impact on the beneficiaries and non-targeted households. This evaluation would review the program's&#13;
effects on indicators such as sustainability of PKSF, POs and borrower viability and well-being. The&#13;
Project Launch Workshop would specifically focus on monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
2.    During negotiations, agreement was reached that: (a) quarterly and annual progress reports&#13;
would be prepared by the PKSF and submitted to MOF, who in turn will submit them to IDA; (b) a&#13;
joint Government, PKSF and IDA mid-term review would be conducted by July 1998 or when 50 % of&#13;
the funds are disbursed, whichever is earlier. PKSF will prepare a comprehensive report before the&#13;
mid-term review; and (c) an Implementation Completion Report would be submitted by the&#13;
Governments to IDA within six months of the closing date of the Project. The scope of the quarterly&#13;
and annual progress reports were agreed at negotiations.&#13;
3.    A summary of performance indicators for the proposed Project is provided in Section B.&#13;
Except for the impact indicators, the input, output and financial indicators can be monitored with&#13;
information generated by the existing PKSF/POs MIS system. The PKSF would develop detailed&#13;
guidelines for tracking and performance-monitoring at the PO level. The guidelines would be designed&#13;
so that the reporting burden on PO is minimized.&#13;
4.    To monitor impact indicators, baseline surveys would be conducted by POs. Terms of&#13;
reference for research studies used for evaluation have been agreed with IDA. Evaluations would be&#13;
undertaken by using sample surveys, supervisory visits, review of audit/evaluation reports, the&#13;
management information system and drawing upon data already collected by other agencies. An&#13;
important independent source of information, to supplement project statistics, for impact evaluation&#13;
would be the Bangladesh Household Expenditure Survey; this is undertaken periodically and would&#13;
help monitor levels of poverty in the urban/rural areas.&#13;
IDA Supervision Requirements&#13;
5.    The nation-wide coverage of the project means that standard supervision arrangements,&#13;
particularly led from headquarters, would not be feasible. In due course, much of the responsibility&#13;
would be taken by IDA's Resident Mission in Bangladesh, supported by local consultants. During the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

start up phase, RMB staff would meet with PKSF regularly at least once a month. Formal project&#13;
supervision would be conducted semi-annually. In addition, a mid-term review will be conducted.&#13;
6.     Table 1 summarizes resource needs for supervision. These inputs are in addition to resource&#13;
needs for the review of progress reports, procurement, supervision report preparation and&#13;
correspondence (which are estimated at six staff weeks per year throughout project implementation).&#13;

7.     Formal semi-annual supervision missions would: (a) require at least two weeks of field work,&#13;
(b) once a year require the services of specialists in microfinance; and (c) review progress of program&#13;
components and procurement, financial statements and disbursements, loan covenants, and the&#13;
implementation of technical assistance,. Specialized skill requirements would be added to the missions&#13;
according to needs identified by previous supervision missions.&#13;

            The Poverty Alleviation Microfinance
            Project has two key objectives: 1) reduce poverty through
            expanding horizontal and vertical outreach of on-going
            successful microfinance programs; and 2) enhance
            institutional and financial sustainability of Palli Karma
            Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) and PKSF's Partner
            Organizations' (POs) credit programs through: (a)
            financing expansion of lending; (b) enhancing the role of
            PKSF; (c) assisting in institutional strengthening of PKSF
            and its borrowers by providing resources for training and
            institution building; (d) providing insight and possible
            solutions to several issues/problems currently facing the
            microfinance system in Bangladesh; and (e) disseminating
            best practices for increasing cost effectiveness of these
            programs. The project components will be the following: 1) a
            line of credit for loans to the poor through POs that meet
            predetermined criteria; and 2) technical assistance for
            capacity and institution building of the POs, PKSF and
            Bangladesh Bank.
