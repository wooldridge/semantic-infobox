   The Water and Sanitation Program is a multi-donor&#13;
 partnership administered by the World Bank to support&#13;
poor people in obtaining affordable, safe, and sustainable&#13;
        access to water and sanitation services.&#13;
&amp;#12;By Sophie TrÃ©molet&#13;
Today, 2.6 billion people live without access to improved&#13;
sanitation. Of these, 75 percent live in rural communities. To&#13;
address this challenge, WSP is working with governments&#13;
and local private sectors to build capacity and strengthen&#13;
performance monitoring, policy, ï¬?nancing, and other&#13;
components needed to develop and institutionalize large&#13;
scale, sustainable rural sanitation programs. With a focus&#13;
on building a rigorous evidence base to support replication,&#13;
WSP combines Community-Led Total Sanitation, behavior&#13;
change communication, and sanitation marketing to&#13;
generate sanitation demand and strengthen the supply&#13;
of sanitation products and services, leading to improved&#13;
health for people in rural areas. For more information,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The case for allocating public funding to support the development and sustain-&#13;
able provision of sanitation services is strong. Sanitation is a basic service with&#13;
substantial positive impacts on both health and the environment, which in turn&#13;
generates benefits for the economy as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
Yet traditional financing for sanitation is not very effective and is typically&#13;
insufficient.&#13;
&#13;
There is typically a lack of clarity about which sanitation sector actors should&#13;
be financed and how. This is often due to the following issues:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Fragmented responsibilities for sector supervision;&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Fragmented responsibilities for service delivery;&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Weak operators (both financially and operationally); and&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Lack of financing channels for traditional funders (such as international&#13;
       donors or governments) to transfer funding en masse to those who need it&#13;
       most, such as households or small-scale entrepreneurs.&#13;
&#13;
This is coupled with a lack of clarity on what available funds should be used&#13;
for, due to the following commonly encountered issues:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢ In many countries, funds have traditionally been spent on hardware sub-&#13;
     sidies that can result in â&#128;&#156;wastedâ&#128;? investments. This is changing, with an&#13;
     increased emphasis on software spending, but the efficiency of these soft-&#13;
     ware â&#128;&#156;investmentsâ&#128;? has yet to be adequately tracked.&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Funds are often misallocated throughout the sanitation value chain, with&#13;
     â&#128;&#156;too muchâ&#128;? funding allocated to sewers and wastewater treatment rather&#13;
     than to improving basic access, for example.&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Funds are usually provided on an â&#128;&#156;input basis,â&#128;? meaning that that there are&#13;
     limited incentives to reduce the costs of providing services.&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Although households are supposed to be the main investors in on-site san-&#13;
     itation, they get limited public support for their investment.&#13;
&#13;
As a result, financing allocated to the sector has so far been limited. This is in&#13;
part because the sanitation sector needs to demonstrate the effectiveness of how&#13;
it uses the funds. If used effectively, public funds could help leverage additional&#13;

&amp;#12;    Results-Based Financing for Sanitation   Making the Case&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    If used effectively, public funds could              financing from other sources, such as households themselves (with or without&#13;
    help leverage additional financing from              microfinance), small-scale private sector, or other sources of public and donor&#13;
    other sources, such as households&#13;

    public and donor funding.                            A key assumption underlying the consideration of RBF for sanitation is that pub-&#13;
                                                         lic financing (subsidies) can be used to realign incentives in sanitation markets&#13;
                                                         and foster more efficient and equitable service delivery. A related assumption is&#13;
                                                         that payments for performance can foster improved and more cost-efficient ser-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
At present, the sanitation sector is riddled with â&#128;&#156;misalignedâ&#128;?   resource allocation at that level. The main issue affecting&#13;
incentives (or market failures) that have limited investment     the sanitation sector as a whole is the lack of prioritiza-&#13;
flows to the sector. This section briefly reviews where incen-   tion, especially when compared with other basic services,&#13;
tives are misaligned across the sanitation value chain (see      such as health, education, and even water. This may be due&#13;

Treatment. Treatment can take place either on-site (some on-site systems allow&#13;
on-site treatment, such as septic tanks, but only if they are adequately main-&#13;
tained) or off-site (when the waste has been collected via sewer networks or pit&#13;
latrine emptiers and transported to a sewage treatment plant). Treatment of these&#13;
waste flows is often critical to protect downstream water resources, public health,&#13;
and the environment.&#13;
&#13;
Table 3 lists some examples of potential failures on the demand and supply sides&#13;
of waste transport and treatment.&#13;
&#13;
Safe disposal. Safe disposal requires isolating the residual waste from human&#13;
beings and from the environment (for example, to protect water resources). This&#13;
can be achieved by building safe disposal sites, which are lined (thereby protecting&#13;
groundwater resources) and set aside from human settlements. Such safe disposal&#13;
sites might not exist in sufficient numbers, however, or might be inappropriately&#13;
built or out of reach for enterprises transporting the waste. For example, if the&#13;
sites are on the outskirts of town and charge a fee for disposal, it may not be eco-&#13;
nomic for pit latrine emptiers to dispose of the waste at those sites.&#13;
&#13;
Reuse. Suitable treatment can result in waste streams being converted into a valu-&#13;
able resource for reuse. Reuse of treated excreta offers significant benefits both in&#13;
terms of reducing the need to find safe disposal sites for waste and because the&#13;
waste itself contains nutrients that are an important resource for agriculture or&#13;
energy generation, either at a large scale (wastewater treatment plants with co-&#13;
generation) or at the domestic/community level through biogas plants.&#13;
&#13;
Table 4 lists some failures that can occur at the reuse step of the sanitation value&#13;
chain.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Addressingâ&#128;? these market failures can be done through a range of policy instru-&#13;
ments, including developing and enforcing regulations, applying penalties and&#13;
standards, or making incentive payments.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Public funds can be used at several levels to realign incentives to provide sustain-&#13;
able sanitation, at the macro level or at the micro level (on the supply or on the&#13;
demand side). This chapter examines the main RBF instruments that have been&#13;
promoted over the years in several sectors (including, for example, health, edu-&#13;
cation, and energy) and assesses whether they are applicable to sanitation. Each&#13;
instrument is introduced and then discussed in terms of its application to the&#13;
sanitation sector.&#13;
&#13;
Macro Level: Modifying Policymakersâ&#128;&#153; Incentives&#13;
As mentioned in Chapter I, policy-makers at the national and local levels might&#13;
be under-prioritizing the sanitation sector. RBF can be used to generate incen-          RBF can be used to generate&#13;
tives for policy-makers to act differently, either at the national level (for example,   incentives for national- and local-level&#13;
                                                                                         policy-makers to act differently.&#13;
through COD Aid) or at the local level (for example, through rewards for local&#13;
governments or communities).&#13;
&#13;
Using Cash on Delivery (COD) Aid: A Contract Between an External Donor&#13;
and National Governments&#13;
What is COD Aid? COD transfers funds, typically to the Ministry of Finance&#13;
(MoF), in proportion to progress toward a mutually agreed outcome such as&#13;
universal primary education completion or reductions in illness. It is presented&#13;
as a way to create incentives for â&#128;&#156;the government to address a problem of its own&#13;
making.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
COD Aid is results-based in the sense that transfers only take place if the goals        Cash on delivery (COD) transfers only&#13;
have been met and progress has been independently verified. The approach lets            take place if specified goals have been&#13;
                                                                                         met and independent verification of&#13;

                                                                                         progress has taken place.&#13;
example, if universal primary education completion is best achieved by building&#13;
roads (so children can get to schools) rather than building schools or training&#13;
teachers, the MoF can allocate funds for that purpose. The recipient can make a&#13;
specific request for additional technical assistance but this is by no means an in-&#13;
tegral (and mandatory) part of the aid package. COD Aid, as a concept, was first&#13;
introduced by US-based Center for Global Development (CGD).&#13;
&#13;
Several donor agencies have expressed interest in incorporating this type of aid&#13;
into the design of their programs. For example, DFID is in the process of nego-&#13;
tiating a COD Aid arrangement with the Government of Ethiopia to support&#13;

    This note indicated that to achieve sustainable improve-&#13;
    ments, a COD Aid contract for water should last at least                                       To encourage sustained coverage, it would be preferable&#13;

    10 years. It was envisaged that depending on the baseline                                      rather than focus exclusively on new coverage. This would&#13;

    How could it be applied to the sanitation sector? COD                                          focusing on new coverage may therefore be inadequate.&#13;
    Aid could be appropriate for the sanitation sector in order&#13;
    to modify governmentsâ&#128;&#153; current attitudes toward the sector.                                    Although an emphasis on coverage is in line with existing&#13;
    A critical issue would be to define an indicator that provides                                 performance verification mechanisms, the debate on post-&#13;
    incentives for governments to invest in a sustainable and                                      MDG indicators has shown that focusing on coverage alone&#13;

     BOX 1: THE NIRMAL GRAM PURASKAR IN INDIA&#13;
&#13;
     The Nirmal Gram Puraskar (NGP) is a national program in which the central government that provides one-off&#13;
     monetary rewards to qualifying Gram Panchayats (local governments). Payments are based on a set of criteria&#13;
     (which include, among others, 100 percent sanitation coverage of individual households and being totally free&#13;
     from open defecation) and are made following a verification process. These rewards range between US$1,250-&#13;
     12,500 per Gram Panchayat, depending on the population. Gram Panchayats can use the cash incentive to im-&#13;
     prove and maintain sanitation facilities in their respective areas with a focus on solid and liquid waste disposal&#13;
     and maintenance of sanitation standards. In addition, the State of Maharashtra has introduced several state-&#13;
     based campaigns, such as the Clean Village campaign (Sant Gadge Baba), which takes place annually and allows&#13;
     for maintaining overall cleanliness in the villages and strengthening the performance verification mechanisms. A&#13;
     key limitation of the program in India is related to the weakness of the performance verification systems, however,&#13;
     which appeared to be prone to some manipulation, particularly in certain states.&#13;

   BOX 2: OUTPUT-BASED AID FOR CONNECTIONS TO WATER AND SEWERAGE&#13;
   IN UNPLANNED URBAN SETTLEMENTS IN MOROCCO&#13;
&#13;
   In Morocco, GPOBA provided a US$7 million grant to three service providers (two private operators and one pub-&#13;
   lic) to extend water and sewerage services into unplanned urban settlements that were formerly excluded from&#13;
   regular service provision. Launched in 2007, the project aimed to connect 11,300 households to piped water and&#13;
   sewerage. The output was a simultaneous connection to piped water and sewerage for poor households. The&#13;
   subsidy was paid in two installments: 60 percent on completion of the connection and 40 percent upon verifica-&#13;
   tion of at least 6 months of sustained service. An independent third party carried out verification. Details of the&#13;
   schemes and the costs of the subsidy varied by operator. Unit subsidies for sewerage connections varied from&#13;
   US$421 in Casablanca to US$913 in MeknÃ¨s, due to differing unit costs and differing ability to pay on the part of&#13;
   households in different cities. Initial progress under the scheme was slow, largely due to a lack of familiarity with&#13;
   this type of scheme, investment delays upstream, and lack of clarity over land tenure. The pace of investment&#13;
   substantially picked up in subsequent years, with Amendis in Tangiers having delivered the expected number of&#13;
   connections ahead of schedule. The Government of Morocco is now exploring options for scaling up the scheme&#13;
   at the national level.&#13;

Most OBA projects so far have focused on providing subsidies per new access point&#13;
(either for connection to the sewerage system in Morocco or for on-site sanitation&#13;
as in Senegal). In a paper commissioned by GPOBA and WSP, TrÃ©molet and Evans&#13;
(2010) argued that OBA mechanisms could be used to finance a much broader&#13;
range of activities, going from demand promotion (or more generally â&#128;&#156;softwareâ&#128;? ac-&#13;
tivities) all the way to sludge reuse and safe disposal. The types of OBA mechanisms&#13;
recommended in this paper are summarized in Table 6 and Figure 2.&#13;
&#13;
The design of individual OBA schemes will depend on the most appropriate way&#13;
to package the provision of sustainable sanitation services, which means that each&#13;
OBA scheme will likely include a combination of several types of results-based&#13;
subsidies. In addition, the management of human excreta may need to be pack-&#13;
aged with that of other waste streams, such as solid waste, for example, if latrines&#13;
or drainage pipes keep filling up with rubbish. OBA subsidies could be provided&#13;
in an integrated manner to encourage the formation of integrated solid waste and&#13;
liquid waste entrepreneurs.&#13;
&#13;
The main focus of any intervention will be determined by identifying which&#13;
funding gaps need to be filledâ&#128;&#148;that is, where market failures or affordability&#13;
constraints mean that a sanitation service is being under-provided. For example,&#13;
if networked sewerage exists but people are not connected, the principle focus for&#13;
OBA subsidies should be on collection/access (building sewerage connections).&#13;
If households have onsite facilities (such as basic latrines), but the pit waste is&#13;
being indiscriminately dumped in the environment, the focus may be on foster-&#13;
ing transport and safe disposal of this waste.&#13;

        BOX 3: SENEGAL: OUTPUT-BASED AID FOR ON-SITE SANITATION AT THE HOUSEHOLD LEVEL&#13;
&#13;
        In Senegal, GPOBA is providing subsidies for on-site sanitation facilities in poor urban and peri-urban areas&#13;
        of Dakar, the capital city. The OBA component was developed in the context of a broader water and sanita-&#13;
        tion project funded by a group of donors and led by the World Bank, the Senegal Long Term Water Project. The&#13;
        OBA component built on an earlier IDA-funded project, PAQPUD (Programme dâ&#128;&#153;Assainissement Autonome des&#13;
        Quartiers PÃ©riurbains de Dakar), which already involved an OBA approach, and led to the construction of 63,500&#13;
        new on-site sanitation facilities in a demand-driven manner, benefiting more than 400,000 people between 2002&#13;
        and 2008. The GPOBA project was initially expected to build on PAQPUD and provide access to an additional&#13;
        15,100 facilities to households living in the Dakar region (approximately 135,900 expected beneficiaries with&#13;
        about nine people per household). Although the project was expected to end in February 2010, it has been ex-&#13;
        tended to the end of 2011, due to slow implementation.&#13;
&#13;
        After 1.5 years of implementation, the level of completion was relatively low (around 7 percent of the initial objec-&#13;
        tive) due to a range of reasons, including:&#13;
            â&#128;¢ The economic crisis had significantly affected Senegalese households who faced difficulties paying for im-&#13;
               proved sanitation among other priorities such as food, schooling, and other essential household expenses.&#13;
            â&#128;¢ The fact that beneficiary households had to pay the full amount of their upfront contribution (about 25 per-&#13;
               cent of the total cost) before the construction starts appeared to be a major obstacle for most beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
        Some of the adjustments that were proposed to address these issues include:&#13;
          â&#128;¢ A stronger involvement of the main micro-finance institution in Senegal to address the difficulties faced by&#13;
             beneficiaries to finance their upfront contributions (although this was tried, it did not help to increase the&#13;
             effectiveness of the program); and&#13;
          â&#128;¢ A revised Information Education Communication (IEC), methodology with an upfront effort in terms of&#13;
             mass communication, an increased IEC budget, and increased involvement of local governments.&#13;

     value chain, the more necessary it                    wise, companies may have a stronger incentive to connect rich or large customers&#13;
     might become to add performance                       rather than those who are poor and more difficult to reach, and likely to consume&#13;
     indicators that strengthen the poverty                and therefore discharge less. For example, in Sri Lanka, GPOBA proposed to cre-&#13;
     targeting.                                            ate incentives for better operation of onsite sanitation by combining a payment&#13;
                                                           for operation of onsite systems with a subsidy for rehabilitation and construction&#13;
                                                           of new facilities. The objective was to create incentives for contractors to enter the&#13;

                                                           As a result, the packaging of sanitation services eligible for a payment could help&#13;

Programa de Letrinas Melhoradas that ran in Mozambique from the late 1980s&#13;
until recently led to the establishment of local workshops to manufacture and sell&#13;
latrine slabs. Their development was first supported through capacity-building&#13;
activities. Following a sharp increase in production prices that had threatened the&#13;
workshopsâ&#128;&#153; commercial viability, ex-post subsidies based on the sales of latrines&#13;
were introduced in the early 1990s and contributed to the strengthening of their&#13;
activities (such subsidies were later partly eliminated, however, leaving the local&#13;
workshops having to make ends meet from selling bricks or renting out space).11&#13;

            situations, the AMC would provide a guaranteed market to the consor-&#13;
            tium for services (and goods) in forthcoming emergencies.&#13;
&#13;
If AMCs for sanitation were successful in such circumstances, they could then&#13;
be tested in circumstances where the risk is considerably greater for the private&#13;
operatorâ&#128;&#148;that is, when householders are purchasers of sanitation services rather&#13;
than the government. However, pre-financing by sanitation entrepreneurs may&#13;
be difficult, especially for product development with a relatively long lead time.&#13;
&#13;
An appropriate funding vehicle for transferring funding on the supply side would&#13;
also need to be defined. For OBA, GPOBA has so far been providing such a vehicle,&#13;
funding pilot projects with grants in the range of US$2â&#128;&#147;7 million. However, scaling&#13;
up these instruments will likely require establishing other types of funding channels,&#13;
such as the Honduras OBA facility13 or other similar vehicles being evaluated in the&#13;
Philippines or Kenya. At international level, existing funds could also be relied upon,&#13;
such as GPOBA, the Global Sanitation Fund (GSF)14 or others to be created.&#13;

Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs)&#13;
What are conditional cash transfers? CCTs make welfare payments conditional&#13;
upon the receiversâ&#128;&#153; actions, usually pre-specified investments in the human capital&#13;
of children. This means that the government only transfers cash to persons who&#13;
meet certain criteria and have adopted certain behaviors. Most CCT programs&#13;
make regular payments to poor mothers if they can prove that their children are&#13;

tions, or the like. CCT programs have been developed in a growing number of&#13;
countries: virtually every country in Latin America has a program and large-scale&#13;
programs now operate in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Turkey, with pilot programs&#13;
in Cambodia, Malawi, Morocco, Pakistan, and South Africa.&#13;
&#13;
How could CCTs be applied to the sanitation sector? Although CCTs have&#13;
been applied to finance several social programs (such as health and education),&#13;
they have yet to be used for water and sanitation. A study funded by the Asian&#13;
Development Bank and the Water and Sanitation Program examined the poten-&#13;
tial to use CCTs for sanitation financing in rural Cambodia.15&#13;
&#13;
The study found that most CCT nutrition programs target mothers with young                          Despite increased awareness of the&#13;

diarrhea, few CCT programs include any components that promote improved                             improved sanitation and hygiene.&#13;

        BOX 4: PROPOSALS FOR A â&#128;&#156;GROW-UP-WITH-A-TOILET PLANâ&#128;? IN CAMBODIA&#13;
&#13;
        Robinson (2010) proposed a plan to ensure that every child in Cambodia â&#128;&#156;grows up with a toiletâ&#128;? through the pro-&#13;
        vision of sanitation financing to poor households during the first five years after the first child is born. The inten-&#13;
        tion is that the development of improved sanitation facilities and the establishment of good sanitation practices&#13;
        among both parents and the first-born will ensure that the rest of the family grows up using a hygienic latrine and&#13;
        observing good sanitation and hygiene practices.&#13;
&#13;
        The five-year plan would be targeted at poor mothers on the birth of their first child, on the basis that poor chil-&#13;
        dren under five are the highest risk group for diarrhea, malnutrition, and worms. Assistance would be provided to&#13;
        the mother of the household to improve household sanitation throughout the five-year period, with both connec-&#13;
        tion subsidies (incentives for the construction of facilities) and outcome-based sustainability incentives (to encour-&#13;
        age long-term improved sanitation practices).&#13;
            â&#128;¢ Year 0 (birth of first child): US$15 toilet voucher (redeemable by local producers) plus a US$5 voucher for&#13;
               a rebate on construction of second latrine pit;&#13;
            â&#128;¢ Years 1â&#128;&#147;5 (annual reward): up to US$10 each year based on following criteria:&#13;
               â&#128;¢ Toilet usage (verified)&#13;
               â&#128;¢ Village toilet coverage (verified)&#13;
               â&#128;¢ Completion of hygiene course&#13;
               â&#128;¢ Presence of handwashing facility&#13;
&#13;
        The plan would be supported by demand-creation programs (CLTS, mass media), sanitation marketing programs&#13;
        to increase and improve the supply of low-cost sanitation goods and services, and micro-finance programs to en-&#13;
        able poor households lying just above the â&#128;&#156;extreme povertyâ&#128;? line to develop improved sanitation facilities.&#13;
&#13;
        The intention of the plan is three-fold:&#13;
           â&#128;¢ To focus attention on the need to target sanitation finance toward improved sanitation among under-five&#13;
               children;&#13;
           â&#128;¢ To recognize that sanitation finance should promote a process of sanitation development over a period of&#13;
               several years (providing incentives for the upgrading of facilities and the adoption of improved behaviors);&#13;
               and&#13;
           â&#128;¢ To encourage more efficient demand-side financing through vouchers and cash transfers in place of exist-&#13;
               ing mechanisms for the supply of in-kind materials and services.&#13;

A fixed value voucher could be linked to a minimum level of sanitation ser-&#13;
vice, with provision for some contribution by the household. Eligibility for a&#13;
latrine voucher could be linked to existing means testing systems, with additional&#13;
criteriaâ&#128;&#148;such as households containing children under fiveâ&#128;&#148;to reduce the num-&#13;
ber of beneficiaries where resources are limited.&#13;
&#13;
An interesting use of vouchers that has been little explored in the sanitation sec-&#13;
tor is to provide a voucher for pit-emptying at the same time that a latrine is&#13;
constructed (irrespective of how the latrine is financed, although OBA subsidies&#13;
would be preferable). Such an approach has been proposed in Sri Lanka in the&#13;
context of the design of a scheme to be supported by GPOBA, which aims to sup-&#13;
port the development of integrated service providers of on-site sanitation services,&#13;
including latrine construction and downstream operations.&#13;
&#13;
Combining Various RBF Instruments&#13;
All such RBF instruments have been used in a number of infrastructure or social&#13;
services (such as health and education) but have either been applied at a limited&#13;
scale in the sanitation sector or not at all.&#13;
&#13;
Each type of instrument has different properties. For example, RBF instruments&#13;
on the supply-side, particularly if they are combined with the introduction of&#13;
competition (via least-cost subsidy bidding systems, for example), can drive down&#13;
the costs of providing the services. RBF instruments on the demand-side, such as&#13;
CCTs, enable households to have better control over how they procure services.&#13;
Interventions on both sides of the market would typically be required, however.&#13;
For example, introducing CCT schemes with sanitation indicators would be of&#13;
limited use if the supply side of the market were not strengthened so as to ensure&#13;
that goods and services get to market.&#13;
&#13;
Before introducing RBF instruments, it will be essential to evaluate in detail&#13;
where such financing instruments may be applicable and how they may be com-&#13;
bined. For example, COD Aid could be used to give incentives to the govern-&#13;
ment to experiment with public policies that place emphasis on performance and&#13;
introduce a series of â&#128;&#156;cascading incentivesâ&#128;? and performance targets in the sector.&#13;
Although RBF instruments have shown to increase focus on performance where&#13;
they have been introduced, COD Aid or other â&#128;&#156;macro RBF instrumentsâ&#128;? are yet&#13;
to be tested at this stage, which means that it is difficult to assess whether such&#13;
â&#128;&#156;performance cultureâ&#128;? can be introduced in such a way throughout a given sector.&#13;

   BOX 5: OPTIMAL RISK TRANSFER IN RESULTS-BASED FINANCING&#13;
&#13;
   The different forms of RBF largely involve creating the right incentives and aligning them with rewards, whether&#13;
   this involves recipient governments, the private sector (including NGOs), or both. Part of this may involve optimal&#13;
   risk allocation in which certain risks are transferred to these entities.&#13;
&#13;
   The principles of optimal risk allocation involve allocating risks to the right degree to those best able to manage&#13;
   and/or absorb them. Optimal risk allocation does not necessarily mean maximum risk transfer. A starting point for&#13;
   such risk transfer consists of transferring those risks that are most controllable by the entity to which the risk is&#13;
   being transferred.&#13;
&#13;
   In the case of transferring risk to the private sector, for example, the starting point is so-called â&#128;&#156;performance risk.â&#128;?&#13;
   This is the risk involved in delivering the service for which a third party has been engagedâ&#128;&#148;in the sense that if the&#13;
   service is not delivered to the agreed level or specification (or in the worst case, not at all), there is a penalty to be&#13;
   paid. Such a penalty will typically be financial in natureâ&#128;&#148;at one extreme this may involve no payment at all.&#13;
&#13;
   Other risks can be more difficult to transfer to the implementing agentsâ&#128;&#148;depending on the contextâ&#128;&#148;particularly&#13;
   those that are much less controllable. These include other commercial risks, such as market risk, which is com-&#13;
   posed of demand risk (price and volume) and payment risks (the ability to collect bills from customers) as well as&#13;
   other categories of risk, such as financial (exchange rate and interest rate risks) and political risks.&#13;
&#13;
   In developing countries, often a good number of these risks need to be left with governments, as they are bet-&#13;
   ter placed to manage them, particularly political risks (war, expropriation, currency transfer) where insurance is&#13;
   often available to international investors and lenders, if governments stand behind their obligations. Attempting&#13;
   to transfer some risks to the private sector will either lead to extremely high-risk premiums being charged, or the&#13;
   project being unbankable (that is, finance will not be made available for it).&#13;
&#13;
   In some instances, it may be optimal to share certain risks, for instance market risks. In such situations, the pri-&#13;
   vate sector may be responsible for an initial degree of risk; thereafter the governments take the remaining risk (or&#13;
   upside where events turn out to be better than envisaged).&#13;

Define the payment schedule. For providers that cannot                         example, a rural water and sanitation authority or a local&#13;
pre-finance, it may be preferable to split the payment be-                     government support fund), new entities to be established,&#13;
tween an ex-ante payment and an ex-post payment (see fur-                      or a specific account (typically an escrow account).&#13;

Define the performance verification mechanisms. These&#13;
can be either based on existing performance verification                       Pre-financing. RBF instruments are based on the prem-&#13;
mechanisms or new ones to be established, such as inde-                        ise that the entity receiving the subsidy has the ability to&#13;
pendent consultants.                                                           pre-finance (in the case of OBA, for example, the service&#13;

                                                          payment by the TSC is extremely long and does not allow them to be financially&#13;
                                                          sustainable. Finally, the need to obtain pre-financing can potentially raise the cost&#13;

&#13;
                                                          An alternative to this is to place only a proportion of the OBA grant at risk for&#13;
                                                          poor performance, such that there would be a lower need for pre-funding. How-&#13;

                                                          service provider could manage the performance risk and would therefore be more&#13;

been designed with an RBF framework in mind (such as village-level awards in&#13;
the context of the NGP program in India) have either partly failed or lost their&#13;
credibility because of the weakness of the performance verification mechanisms.&#13;
In existing OBA sanitation programs (such as in Morocco), performance verifica-&#13;
tion has been carried out by international reputable experts, who have visited the&#13;
program on a regular basis. This type of performance verification mechanism can&#13;
be used in the context of an internationally funded pilot project but may be dif-&#13;
ficult to scale-up, particularly when domestic funds are being used.&#13;
&#13;
In other programs where RBF principles have been used but insufficient atten-&#13;
tion has been paid to independent verification, several problems have emerged,&#13;
such as:&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Performance verification is done only once, usually too soon after scheme&#13;
       completion, which means that sustainability cannot be ensured;&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Verification is not truly independent: instead, self-reporting is used or an&#13;
       agent who has a stake in the process or can be influenced performs the&#13;
       verification. This can result in the over-inflation of results.&#13;
&#13;
A combination of various system of performance verification may therefore need&#13;
to be defined.&#13;
&#13;
Organizational challenges at the donor level. Some donor organizations may&#13;
have difficulties switching from a traditional â&#128;&#156;input-basedâ&#128;? method of financing&#13;
to an RBF approach largely because of constraints linked to their own inter-&#13;
nal procedures. RBF methods are less prescriptive about the means to achieve a&#13;
specified goal, which may run against traditional procurement procedures. At the&#13;
other end of the spectrum, other organizations may have adopted an â&#128;&#156;outcomeâ&#128;?&#13;
focus (such as UNICEF). They may perceive a focus on outputs as a move back&#13;
to focusing on inputs (that is, number of toilets built as opposed to behavior&#13;
change).&#13;
&#13;
A potential solution is to adopt an RBF approach on a pilot-basis initially, which&#13;
may allow going around existing internal rules and procedures. If a pilot can&#13;
demonstrate the approachâ&#128;&#153;s validity, consideration can be given to scaling it up&#13;
and amending existing procedures.&#13;

      BOX 6: THE HEALTH RESULTS INNOVATION TRUST FUND&#13;
&#13;
      The Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF) is funded by the Government of Norway and the United King-&#13;
      dom, with commitments totaling more than US$500 million through 2022. The HRITF finances activities to en-&#13;
      hance access to and improve the quality of basic health services using a variety of RBF mechanisms. The HRITF&#13;
      has four specific aims:&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Support design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of RBF mechanisms;&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Develop and disseminate the evidence base for implementing successful RBF mechanisms;&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Build country institutional capacity to scale up and sustain RBF mechanisms, within the national health&#13;
            strategy and system; and&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Attract additional financing to the health sector.&#13;
&#13;
      The HRITF works with development partners and client countries to build and use country systems, wherever&#13;
      possible.&#13;
&#13;
      The HRITF supports:&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Country Pilot Grants to design, implement, monitor, and evaluate RBF mechanisms, with the following&#13;
           countries currently supported: Afghanistan, Benin, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, India, Kyr-&#13;
           gyz Republic, Rwanda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe;&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Seed grants to assess the value and feasibility of RBF mechanisms in countries;&#13;

         â&#128;¢ A global website for knowledge and learning (see www.rbfhealth.org); and&#13;
         â&#128;¢ An Interagency Working Group (IWG) on RBF, co-chaired by the World Bank, to share knowledge, best&#13;
           practices, and lessons learned&#13;

a good way to raise the profile of RBF for sanitation and share experiences once&#13;
these become more numerous. For example, as GPOBA evolves to become a&#13;
â&#128;&#156;center of excellenceâ&#128;? on output-based aid (rather than a direct provider of OBA&#13;
subsidies), a section of its website could support resources dedicated to using&#13;
RBF for sanitation more specifically. In the first instance, and short of creating a&#13;
dedicated website, this could take the form of a â&#128;&#156;virtual groupâ&#128;? or community of&#13;
practice that could disseminate results, share lessons, and learn from each other&#13;
as well as from people who have applied RBF in other sectors or could be incor-&#13;
porated as a key topic for the recently launched international Community of&#13;
Practice on sanitation.&#13;

            Scaling up rural sanitation : identifying
            the potential for results-based financing for sanitation
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Results-Based Financing (RBF) refers to
            a broad family of financial instruments. With RBF, public
            funding is provided only if pre-specified results have been
            achieved. Its use in the sanitation sector has so far been
            limited, as opposed to in other sectors such as health or
            education. This working paper aims to identify practical
            ideas for advancing the use of innovative financing
            mechanisms focused on results and performance, with a view
            to supporting the delivery of sustainable sanitation
            services. To this end, the report review: a) the rationale
            for examining RBF instruments for sanitation; b) current
            issues with sanitation, where 'misaligned
            incentives' mean that inadequate services are being
            provided or demanded; c) how public funding, if allocated
            based on results, could help with realigning incentives; and
            d) common issues and challenges with the design of RBF instruments.
