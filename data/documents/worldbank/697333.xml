1. WATERWAYS&#13;
A. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
Economic Growth and Impact&#13;
1.1   During 1980-93, economic growth in China averaged 9.4 percent a year, as the country&#13;
adopted an open-door policy and benefited from foreign investment. As a result, demand for&#13;
transport increased enormously. In 1993 alone, freight and passenger traffic grew at an average&#13;
of 7 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Moreover, freight volumes in China have historically&#13;
been high. To produce one dollar of econornic output, China handles 50 percent more ton-&#13;
kilometers (t.km) of traffic than India and Brazil, primarily due to the long distances between the&#13;
country's coal reserves and its relatively large, coal-dependent heavy-industry sector. A large gap&#13;
between transport supply and demand consequently emerged.&#13;
1.2   To meet this demand, the country has been expanding its transport system substantially,&#13;
but despite considerable growth, the transport network remains one of the sparsest in the world&#13;
compared with the area and population it serves. The main reason for this sector's&#13;
underdevelopment is the relatively low level of transport investment, which averaged only&#13;
1.3 percent of gross national product during 1981-91, as compared with 2 to 3 percent for other&#13;
countries such as India, the Republic of Korea and Brazil. As a result, congestion and bottlenecks&#13;
are routine on various parts of the systern, service is often poor and rationed, and the economy&#13;
has suffered losses.&#13;
Traffic&#13;
1.3   Growth. During 1982-92, freight traffic has grown at 8.1 percent a year and passenger&#13;
traffic at almost 10 percent a year, as indicated by turnover volume of traffic (see Tables 1.1 and&#13;
1.2). Highway freight traffic expanded more than the other modes, at 14.7 percent, compared&#13;
with 6.6 percent for rail traffic and 9.5 percent for coastal and inland waterway traffic. Intercity&#13;
passenger travel per capita, despite rapid increases, remains very low, at about two thirds the level&#13;
for India-primarily due to severe capacity constraints. Although air travel is rapidly expanding&#13;
and grew by more than 21 percent a year during 1982-92, it still represents a small share of total&#13;
traffic, as most long-distance trips are made by rail.&#13;
1.4   Modal Distribution. Although the railway's share of traffic has declined over the last decade&#13;
as the share of road and inland waterways (IWW) traffic has grown, rail transport still dominates&#13;
freight and passenger traffic in China. In 1992, about 57 percent of freight and 46 percent of passenger&#13;
traffic turnover was attributable to rail, with the remainder moved by road, IWW, coastal shipping,&#13;
pipeline, and civil aviation. This preemninence of the railway is due in part to the past dependence of the&#13;
Chinese economy on heavy industry and in part to the relatively long transport distances. In the case of&#13;
passenger transport, dominance of the railway is due to the poor quality and inadequate capacity of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
road system and intercity bus services, the virtual absence of pnvate automobiles, and the limited use of&#13;
civil aviation. The movement toward a market economy will increase demand for market-responsive&#13;
transport services, favoring a shift to road transport but still leaving a growing market for the relatively&#13;
low-cost inland waterways and rail transport systems.&#13;
Transport Reforms&#13;
1.5   In the past decade, China's economic reforms have aimed to increase economic efficiency&#13;
through measures designed to reduce national government intervention in the production and&#13;
distribution process, reduce the Government's deficits and subsidies to state-owned enterprises, and&#13;
open the economy by expanding trade and allowing further participation of private and collective&#13;
enterprises. In the transport sector, several reforms have been undertaken in line with these&#13;
objectives--many with Bank assistance. Notably, the Government has:&#13;
(a)   allowed decentralization of operations in 1985, commercalization in 1989, and a&#13;
market economy in 1993;&#13;
(b)   reduced the extent of commodity price distortions by (i) decreasing the volumes of&#13;
commodities produced in the State Plan, and (ii) raising the in-plan prices of&#13;
commodities closer to market levels;&#13;
(c)   increased the tariffs charged by state transport enterprises, including railway, highway&#13;
and waterway, to levels approaching their long-run marginal costs;&#13;
(d)   encouraged provincial governments to develop many local railways, which now total&#13;
some 4,400 route-km and interconnect with the national standard gauge network;&#13;
(e)   allowed private individuals and collective and township enterprises to provide&#13;
passenger and freight transport services on roads and inland waterways, and&#13;
encouraged provincial and national authorities to develop transport systems with&#13;
private sector financing;&#13;
(f)   carried out major structural reforms in the organization and management of civil&#13;
aviation and in the ports, leading to increased financial autonomy and accountability,&#13;
and to less central government controls thus paving the way for introduction of&#13;
competitive services;&#13;
(g)   reduced operating and capital subsidies for major infrastructure services, through&#13;
higher cost-recovery and increased reliance on user-funded capital construction; and&#13;
(h)   encouraged the introduction of more modem technology in the transport system&#13;
primarily by improving rolling stock technology in the railways; enhancing container&#13;
and bulk handling capacity in the ports; improving road pavement design and geometric&#13;
standards for the expansion of motorization in the highway subsector, and increasing&#13;
the use of computerized data processing and planning techniques in operations in all&#13;
modes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
The Remaining Challenges&#13;
1.6   In the future, these reform initiatives will need to be expanded and pursued even more&#13;
vigorously. In addition, much more needs to be done on the level of investment, intermodal&#13;
planning and pricing to put in place a national transport system capable of meeting the transport&#13;
needs of China's rapidly growing and changing economy. To alleviate transport bottlenecks and&#13;
rationalize the transport system, the Government will need to take the following measures within the&#13;
coming decade:&#13;
(a)   increase the total level of transport investment in relation to GNP, to expand capacity&#13;
to meet the new traffic demands and to clear up the backlogs caused by past&#13;
underinvestment;&#13;
(b)   aim for balanced investments among the major freight transport modes of railways,&#13;
highways, and waterways in terms of optimal economic cost of transport;&#13;
(c)   realign further the prices of freight transport services and those of the major&#13;
commodities, especially coal, to bring them closer to their real costs;&#13;
(d)   increase further the productivity of existing transport assets through technological&#13;
modernization and management reforms; and&#13;
(e)   improve and expand the multimodal transport system, both across and within modes,&#13;
with particular emphasis on more extensive use of containers.&#13;
B. INLAND WATERWAYS TRANSPORT&#13;
The Network&#13;
1.7   China has 5,800 rivers navigable for 110,200 km, 15 rivers over 1,000 km long and 12&#13;
lakes with an area greater than 1,000 km2. Nevertheless, the major IWW comprise only four&#13;
rivers and one canal, which carry 80 percent of total IWW traffic. The Yangtze River system is&#13;
by far the largest IWW.&#13;
IWW                                 Region         km&#13;
1. Yangtze (Changjiang) River       Central       72,813&#13;
2. Zhujiang (Pearl) River            South        13,000&#13;
3. Heilongjiang River                North         4,696&#13;
4. Huaihe River                     Central        1,213&#13;
5. Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal      East          1,044&#13;
Total                                       92,766&#13;
1.8   China has a long history of using this extensive waterway network of rivers and lakes and&#13;
of canal construction. Excavation of the Grand Canal, by connecting river tributaries, was started&#13;
in about 480 BC.  However, significant underfunding in this subsector has caused the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
infrastructure and floating equipment to deteriorate badly, and reduced the net size of the&#13;
navigable network from 172,000 km in 1960 to 148,400 km in 1970 and to 109,700 km in 1993.&#13;
The lack of a multipurpose infrastructure development approach and methodology, and of&#13;
coordination among the various ministries in charge of infrastructure also contributed to the IWW&#13;
decline. For example, many hydropower dams have been built without consulting other interested&#13;
agencies and without providing shiplocks to allow uninterrupted IWW transport.&#13;
1.9   Thus, between 1961 and 1991, IWW shrunk 36 percent, from 172,000 km to 109,700 km.&#13;
Over the past decade, although the network size was almost unchanged, other modes registered&#13;
positive growth. For example, from 1986 to 1993, the length of the national road network (class&#13;
1 and 2 roads) increased by 61 percent, from 203,800 km to 327,300 km, railway main lines grew&#13;
by 8.2 percent, from 64,125 km to 69,412 km, while IWW grew by only by 0.7 percent, from&#13;
109,400 km to 110,200 km. Given China's highly congested transport environment, where the&#13;
opportunity cost of the transport shortage is high, IWW are an extreme case of planning&#13;
inefficiency and neglect of a valuable resource.&#13;
Subsector Organization&#13;
1.10  Administration. The Ministry of Communications (MOC) provides nationwide policy&#13;
guidelines, regulations, and the design, standards and financial support for IWW construction,&#13;
with IWW administration carried out by provincial communications departments (PCDs), guided&#13;
by MOC. The construction, maintenance and day-to-day management of the IWW infrastructure,&#13;
however, has been delegated to local communications bureaus at the municipal, township and&#13;
county levels. Since mid-1984, responsibility for 15 national ports has been decentralized to&#13;
provincial and municipal governments.&#13;
1.11  Each river's IWW system is independently developed and operated, with no interaction&#13;
among them. This means barges and vessels must navigate within just one IWW system, and&#13;
barge types and convoy formations are unique to each. Except in the Yangtze River, channel&#13;
depth is shallow, at less than 1 meter in about 50 percent of the IWW system. Only 8 percent can&#13;
accommodate barges of 330 tons (t) or more.&#13;
1.12 Planning. MOC is responsible for the comprehensive master plan and investment&#13;
strategies for the IWW system. Once approved by the State Council, the plan becomes the long-&#13;
term development plan that provincial governments, responsible for engineering design,&#13;
construction, operation and maintenance of the IWW system, follow. MOC coordinates overall&#13;
planning and financial aid for constructing priority sections of the IWW, since most river&#13;
construction involves more than one province and transport mode.&#13;
1.13  Financing. IWW construction and maintenance is not self-financing. The main source of&#13;
revenue has been the waterway maintenance fee, levied as a percentage of the shipping&#13;
companies' and private shipowners' gross revenues. These amounts permit only minimum&#13;
channel maintenance by the PCDs, and MOC contributes to their costs. Recently, the PCDs have&#13;
introduced a waterway construction fee that is calculated on a ton-km basis. With regard to the&#13;
river ports, the local communication bureaus collect a port construction fee to partly finance their&#13;
development, but again, it is not sufficient to sustain port development. The possibility of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
collecting IWW fees directly from shipowners, based on the carrying capacity of the registered&#13;
fleet, should be explored, as well as annual safety inspections and renewal of the vessel certificates&#13;
and licenses.&#13;
1.14 The IWW Industry. Governments at all levels are focusing on developing demand-&#13;
driven transport services. Traditional IWW services have been significantly commercialized with&#13;
respect to shipping, shipbuilding and IWW port companies, and freight forwarding.&#13;
1.15  Competition among shipping companies already exists. They have been independent since&#13;
the commercialization reform, and pay taxes to the central and provincial governments. However,&#13;
state-owned companies have been carrying comparatively more cargo over the longer distances in&#13;
larger barges. As more and more companies are privatized, it is expected that they will handle&#13;
more cargo. In Guangxi, a province included in the proposed project, of the 260 companies&#13;
operating, five are state-owned, 130 are collectives and 125 are private. The provinces have been&#13;
making progress in providing free access to resources such as labor, fuel and materials.&#13;
1.16  While port infrastructure is owned by provincial and local governments, operations are&#13;
increasingly carried out by independent companies. For example, in Zhejiang, another project&#13;
province, two major public IWW ports at Hangzhou and Qianjiang are operated by financially and&#13;
commercially independent companies. And, as there are about 200 privately owned berths&#13;
compared with 80 public berths, this indicates that port operations are not restricted to&#13;
government-owned entities. About 85 percent of Zhejiang's IWW traffic is now handled by the&#13;
private sector.&#13;
1.17  Shipbuilding is being corporatized or commercialized, and public shipyards have become&#13;
financially and commercially independent. Many collectively-owned shipyards and maintenance&#13;
facilities are building and maintaining their own fleets, and those of others. For example, the&#13;
Zhejiang Shipbuilding Industrial Corporation has about 50 shipbuilding and repair facilities, and&#13;
builds about 60,000 dwt annually. In addition, many smaller collectively-owned facilities build for&#13;
their own use. Competition in the shipbuilding industry is increasing.&#13;
1.18  Cargo owners are free to deal with any shipping companies they choose, and negotiate&#13;
transport services and tariffs. And, with the move to a market economy, freight forwarding&#13;
services are being liberalized and privatized. However, competition could be strengthened if there&#13;
were (a) freedom of access to materials, repairs, and accessories at standardized prices, (b) access&#13;
to bank credit, and (c) full freedom to hire labor (state-owned companies are still not free to hire&#13;
or fire).&#13;
C. MAJOR ISSUES IN THE IWW SUBSECTOR&#13;
1.19 The following critical issues constraining adequate development and management of the&#13;
IWW network have been identified, and will need to be addressed in the context of the overall&#13;
rationalization of China's transport system:&#13;
(a)   Inadequate Capital Investments. During the last four decades, less than 1 percent of&#13;
total national investment in capital construction was allocated to the IWW. As a result,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
most of the navigable channels were not maintained and/or improved, which caused the&#13;
system to be underutilized and led to higher unit transport costs and lower safety&#13;
standards;&#13;
(b)    Lack of Investment Coordination. Many dams and bridges financed through various&#13;
government agencies were constructed without consultation with the IWW authorities,&#13;
and without provision of shiplocks. This meant that ships could no longer use the&#13;
waterways, and the navigable length of rivers declined by 36 percent during the past 30&#13;
years.&#13;
(c)    Lack of an Autonomous National IWW Agency. Critically needed coordination of&#13;
the IWW subsector with other parts of the transport sector and with other sectors&#13;
requires establishment of a fully authorized agency with its own budget to represent&#13;
IWW interests at the national level and to develop, maintain and maximize use of the&#13;
system.&#13;
(d)   Low Tariff Levels. For surface transport, the IWW has been identified as the most&#13;
economic means to move low-valued bulk cargo. However, while IWW operating&#13;
costs should be much lower than those of rail (by consuming 20 to 30 percent less&#13;
energy), due to inadequate maintenance and poor operations, costs have risen.&#13;
The proposed project would address some of these issues in the context of supporting an IWW&#13;
reform program in three provinces.&#13;
D. BANK GROUP PARTICIPATION&#13;
1.20  Transport Investments and Studies. The Bank Group has supported initiatives by the&#13;
Government in the transport sector through loans and credits totaling $4.7 billion for 30 projects&#13;
(Table 1.3). The dialogue between the Government and the Bank Group on transport sector&#13;
operations and strategy has been strengthened through long-term strategy studies for railways,&#13;
highways and ports development, and through project preparation activities and project-financed&#13;
studies as well as sector studies carried out in collaboration with Chinese authorities. The various&#13;
studies have, inter alia, emphasized the areas of multimodal transport investment and the setting&#13;
of sectoral priorities based on systemwide economic evaluation techniques.'&#13;
1.21   Recent Bank Group reports on the transport sector include China's Raihvay Strategy (No.&#13;
10592-CHA) issued in February 1993, Highway Development and Management: Issues; Options and&#13;
Strategies (No. 11819-CHA) issued in February 1994, and Strategies for Road Freight Development&#13;
(No. 12600-CHA) issued in January 1995. Furthermore, MOC and the Bank have launched an&#13;
Six of the studies have explored multimodal pricing and investment issues in a more comprehensive and&#13;
economically oriented analytical framework than was formerly available to China's decisionmakers: the&#13;
Guangdong Comprehensive Transport Planning Study (GCTPS); the Yangtze Economic Zone Transport Study&#13;
(YEZTS); the Coal Transport Study (CTS); the Railway Investment Study (RIS); the Southeast Coastal Region&#13;
Strategic Issues in Ports and Shipping Development Study (SIPS); and the Price Reform Study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
institutional-strengthening component for MOC in the China Reform, Institutional Support and&#13;
Preinvestment Project (Credit 2447-CHA, FY92). The Bank Group also conducted a srvey of the&#13;
national water transport system in the mid-1980s, which reaffirmed the need to further exploit the large&#13;
potential of the Chinese waterways.&#13;
1.22  Based on past project and sector work, the Bank has an opportunity to deepen its involvement&#13;
and assist the Government in the design and implementation of institutional and sectoral reforms in&#13;
areas such as strategy formulation, investment planning, pricing, financing, deregulation of transport&#13;
services, operational efficiency, and transfer of advanced transport-related technology through training&#13;
and provision of up-to-date equipment. Chinese authorities and the Bank Group are currently&#13;
preparing a comprehensive transport sector strategy paper that is expected to help guide sector&#13;
development in a consistent, cohesive policy framework.&#13;
1.23  With respect to IWW development, the sector strategy paper is expected to recommend&#13;
IWW expansion when waterways offer the most economic means of heavy bulk freight transport&#13;
in a corridor, and when intersectoral rationalization of services are beneficial to economic&#13;
development. Recommendations for efficiency improvements are likely to include, among others,&#13;
commercialization and corporatization of operating companies, introduction of competition and&#13;
transparency, assurance of cost-based tariffs, transfer of modern technology and up-to-date&#13;
approaches to operational and environmental matters, and improvement and expansion of&#13;
multimodal transport facilities, particularly for containers. The proposed project was designed&#13;
with a view to such a strategy.&#13;
1.24  The proposed project includes development of small hydropower stations in conjunction&#13;
with construction of two dams, the latter to improve navigation by raising the river level. The&#13;
Bank's highly successful involvement in the power sector supports the Government's ambitious&#13;
sector reform program of enterprise commercialization and reduction of barriers to sector entry.&#13;
Bank assistance to power companies combines investment in capacity expansion as well as&#13;
institutional development, electricity conservation, and sector regulatory development. The Bank&#13;
is also working with the Chinese authorities on ways to expand private financing of power&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
1.25  Lessons Learned in Implementation. As the proposed project would be the Bank's first&#13;
IWW project in China, project preparation was guided by general lessons learned in previous&#13;
projects throughout the transport sector, but particularly in ports, experience with IWW gained in&#13;
other countries and lessons learned in the power sector. While implementation of Bank-supported&#13;
projects has been generally satisfactory, management and quality of construction, project&#13;
coordination, cost recovery, maintenance and tariff policies could have been improved. In the&#13;
proposed project, to ensure the quality of construction and management, a project implementation&#13;
unit is being formed, using the most qualified staff available and assisted by international and local&#13;
consultants where appropriate. To ensure a high level of cost recovery, new tariff levels and the&#13;
means to increase them periodically would be introduced under the project, with covenanted&#13;
performance targets, to allow coverage of operating costs, debt service, maintenance and a&#13;
contribution to future investment. For effective project coordination, a project liaison group&#13;
would be established, comprised of implementing agency representatives. Since two of the&#13;
project provinces, Hunan and Guangxi, are still relatively inexperienced with Bank projects, a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
well-planned, time-phased training program has been included in the project to, inter alia, improve&#13;
staff capabilities in civil works supervision, project management, and environmental assessment.&#13;
1.26 Bank involvement in IWW development worldwide has been limited to projects in&#13;
Myaniar, Thailand, Bangladesh, Romania and what was formerly the Congo. These projects&#13;
have indicated the need for technical assistance and training to improve implementation&#13;
capabilities, substantial supervision early in the project-particularly regarding procurement and&#13;
training, and promotion of cost consciousness and operating efficiency. These requirements have&#13;
been met by the project design and proposed supervision arrangements.&#13;
1.27 Previous hydropower projects have also demonstrated the need for technical panels and&#13;
consultants to enhance implementation quality. and acceleration of sector and enterprise reform to&#13;
increase efficiency. The project therefore provides for a technical panel responsible for ensuring&#13;
dam safety, agreement on adequate pricing of power supplied by the project, and an institutional&#13;
and financial reform action plan to be carried out under the project to accelerate the reform&#13;
process in the participating institutions.&#13;

2. THE PROJECT AREA: IWW AND REFORM&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
2.1   The proposed project is the Bank's first operation focused solely on China's important&#13;
IWW system. Since this extensive subsector poses numerous challenges that will take some time&#13;
to address, definition of the project area and the scope and types of activities to be financed had to&#13;
be approached carefully. After lengthy discussion by the Government and the Bank, and studies&#13;
of critical sections of China's transport system-including the Yangtze Economic Zone, the&#13;
Southeast Coastal Region, the rapidly growing Guangdong area, and the transport implications of&#13;
the country's energy reliance on coal-the Government and the Bank concurred that this initial&#13;
IWW activity would be a well-balanced effort in both geographic and operational terms.&#13;
*Improvements to the IWW system under the project would therefore be carried out both in the&#13;
relatively rich coastal province of Zhejiang, where IWW bottlenecks have periodically brought&#13;
segments of the area economy to a standstill, and in the poor, relatively neglected provinces of&#13;
Hunan and Guangxi, where proposed IWW development would help open up the local economies&#13;
by improving transport between the provinces and the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, respectively.&#13;
Completion of a river channel from Nanning City in Guangxi to booming Guangzhou in&#13;
Guangdong would bring additional benefits to the economies of two other poor provinces in&#13;
southwest China-Yunnan and Guizhou-which will soon have improved rail and road&#13;
connections to Nanning. The proposed project is also balanced in terms of 'hardware" and&#13;
'toftware." Project infrastructure investments would be complemented by a substantial training&#13;
and technical assistance program to support general institutional development and the&#13;
implementation of an institutional and financial reform plan, consistent with market economics.&#13;
The project is therefore designed to both promote and sustain China's development, and to&#13;
further the reform agenda being pursued by the Government, with Bank support.&#13;
B. 'IE PROJECT AREA: HUNAN, GUANGXI AND ZHEJIANG PROVINCES&#13;
Overview&#13;
2.2   Two of the three project provinces, Hunan and Guangxi, are adjacent to each other in&#13;
southern China: Hunan is landlocked, while Guangxi is located on the coast. The third province,&#13;
Zhejiang, is also situated on the coast, just south of Shanghai (see maps). Although Hunan and&#13;
Guangxi are relatively poor compared with some other provinces, recent strong economic growth&#13;
has translated into demand for transport services. In Zhejiang, which is more developed, the lack&#13;
of adequate transport is hampering growth in the whole area served by the project IWW.&#13;
Average annual growth of the transport network in the three provinces from 1985 to 1993 was&#13;
only 0.3 to 2.3 percent. Despite geographical constraints, the three provinces have continued to&#13;
grow in terns of population, contribution to GNP and to Gross Output Value of Agriculture and&#13;
Industry (GOVAI) (see the table below).&#13;

2.3    The transport networks in the three provinces consist mainly of railways, highways and the&#13;
waterways.  Roadways are an important part, as they accommodate high-density traffic.&#13;
However, they are used mostly for short distances: the average trip length was only 35 km to&#13;
58 km in 1993. Long-distance transport, both for passengers and freight, occurs mainly on the&#13;
rail system. A breakdown of traffic by mode for the three provinces is given in Table 2.1.&#13;
2.4   Inland waterways represent a critical alternative to the highways and railways, both for&#13;
short and long distances, as they could support local activities with regular freight and passenger&#13;
service. But, under the Seventh and Eighth Five-Year Plans, waterway investments in the three&#13;
provinces (as in the rest of the country) represented only a small portion of total investment in&#13;
transport. Being shallow and poorly developed, the waterways cannot accommodate demand or&#13;
the expanding container traffic. The IWW share of total traffic in 1993 is shown below.&#13;

2.5    Congestion in the channels and the poor condition of IWW infrastructure are major causes&#13;
of accidents. Shipping accidents, measured in relation to the number of registered ships, have&#13;
increased 300 percent in Zhejiang since 1980. Although they decreased in Hunan between 1980&#13;
and 1993, this is largely because of the sharp decline in the number of registered ships (due to the&#13;
increased size of vessels) from about 31,000 to 21,000 over the same period. Conditions in&#13;
Guangxi are similar to those in Hunan, which are basically the same as in the rest of the country's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
IWW. Details on the provincial IWW fleets and on waterway accidents are given in Tables 2.2&#13;
and 2.3, respectively.&#13;
Provincial Transport Systems&#13;
2.6   Hunan. With an average annual per capita income of Y 1,240 in 1992 (compared to the&#13;
national average of Y 1,736 per year), Hunan contains a major north-south industrial corridor,&#13;
along which are located five industrial cities (Zhuzhou, Yueyang, Changsha, Xiangtan and&#13;
Hengyang, see map), which account for over half the province's output. The most important&#13;
commodities are building materials, minerals and grains, which are shipped out of the province for&#13;
both domestic consumption and export. Four rail lines and five state highways run the length of&#13;
the corridor. Some sections of the rail lines are saturated and the others operate close to capacity.&#13;
The lines extend from Beijing-Guangzhou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Hunan-Guizhou and Hunan-Guangxi&#13;
and carry 69 percent of the freight and 55 percent of passenger traffic. The five highways also&#13;
haul a large share (24 percent), carrying the railway's overflow. The Bank's recently approved&#13;
Railways VII Project will electrify and upgrade the 1,044 km Wuhan-Guangzhou rail line, which&#13;
is particularly congested.&#13;
2.7   The main river in the province, the Xiangjiang, also parallels the corridor, flowing from&#13;
south to north, where it joins Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River. Hunan's major inland&#13;
waterways are located along this river and could be an important transport route for nearly 800&#13;
km, from the city (and port) of Hengyang in the southern part of the province, to Zhuzhou, in the&#13;
north. At this point, the river connects to a waterway section that has already been improved-&#13;
extending to the Yangtze River and then to the sea. At present, since the waterway on the&#13;
Hengyang-Zhuzhou section is shallow, navigation is poor and vessels are restricted to under 300&#13;
tons. Thus, its share of freight is limited (only 5.8 percent). Under the proposed project,&#13;
upgrading the waterway would allow vessels to carry 1,000 tons, to match the vessel size&#13;
accommodated on the upgraded stretch from Zhuzhou to the Yangtze. Also, the waterway's&#13;
share of freight could be substantially increased (waterway traffic is estimated to grow by 3.4&#13;
percent a year) and it could offer a low-cost, environmentally sound alternative to rail and&#13;
highway transport.&#13;
2.8   Guangxi. Located along the southern coast, Guangxi, with an annual per capita income&#13;
of Y 1,1 15 in 1992, is an autonomous region near Hunan, Guangdong and Hong Kong (for the&#13;
purpose of this report, it will be called a province). Serving as a land bridge between the inland&#13;
provinces and the coast, Guangxi contains eight national highways (totaling 5,042 km) and four&#13;
major rail lines (totaling 1,089 km of track). The railway is the dominant carrier for freight,&#13;
hauling 61 percent of the total, and is severely congested.&#13;
2.9   The province is intersected by the Xijiang River, which, along with its branches, extends&#13;
into 85 percent of the land area. Historically, the province has depended on this river for contact&#13;
with the outside world. Flowing from west to east, it constitutes the inland waterway system,&#13;
extending from Nanning, the capital (in the western part of the province), all the way to the&#13;
eastern border with Guangdong (a major industrial province on the coast). It is important&#13;
because it carries 14 percent of Guangxi's total freight, most of which is heavy commodities (coal,&#13;
phosphorus and nonmetal minerals) hauled from the inland provinces of Guizhou and Yunnan. A&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
first phase of upgrading the stretch of the Xijiang that runs within the adjacent province of&#13;
Guangdong to the Pearl River Delta and the sea has been completed, allowing navigation by large&#13;
vessels from the Delta all the way to Guiping. The 854 km section between Guiping and Nanning&#13;
is shallow. Under the project, this section of the river would be deepened and, to raise water&#13;
levels, a dam built with an associated power plant at the city of Guigang. The waterway's&#13;
managing entity already owns and operates a hydropower station at Guiping built earlier.&#13;
2.10  Zhejiang. With an annual per capita income of Y 2,500 in 1992, Zhejiang is located on&#13;
the eastern coast immediately south of Shanghai. Less than 30 percent of the land is flat or&#13;
rolling, most of which is in the northwest corner (part of the Yangtze Delta) and along the coast&#13;
(the most prosperous area). Some of the province is highly developed, and most economic&#13;
activity is heavily influenced by the city of Shanghai. The province has three railway trunk lines&#13;
and three branch lines, totaling nearly 850 km of track, along with five national highways. Nearly&#13;
28 percent of freight is carried by rail and 26.5 percent by road.  The road network is&#13;
underdeveloped, with only 7 km of expressways, no class 1 highways and about 1,700 km of class&#13;
2 highways. Highway transport grew most rapidly during the past decade (30 percent a year),&#13;
compared with 3 percent for railways and 12 percent for waterways. The Bank has been involved&#13;
in developing the provincial highway system since 1992. Because the province is experiencing&#13;
rapid economic growth, it is critical for transport to be improved -especially among the&#13;
industrial cities that comprise an area known as the 'golden triangle" (Huzhou, Hangzhou and&#13;
Jiaxing) and between each of them and Shanghai.&#13;
2.11  The province's large network of waterways, which serve both local and long-distance&#13;
transport, radiate in all directions and carried over 88 million tons (17.7 percent) of freight in&#13;
1993. The four most important waterways are the Grand Canal (Beijing-Hangzhou), and those&#13;
between Changxi-Shanghai, Hangzhou-Shanghai, and Zhappu-Suzhou, which accommodate large&#13;
convoys of barges: 50 percent of the coal to the golden triangle and 66 percent of construction&#13;
materials bound for Shanghai are hauled by waterways. However, the waterways are extremely&#13;
congested, shallow, and obstructed by low bridges; thus, traffic growth has been frozen. Under&#13;
the project, part of the Grand Canal will be improved and the other waterways will be deepened.&#13;
Vessel capacity, which is as low as 80 tons, will be increased to 300 tons.&#13;
C. FINANCIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL REFORMS&#13;
Long-Term Objectives&#13;
2.12 By establishing a modern enterprise system and cultivating a market economy, the&#13;
Government plans to eliminate subsidies and help IWW become financially self-sufficient. To do&#13;
so, the IWW will need to: (a) operate under commercial principles, and (b) improve productivity&#13;
and reduce costs. When these are realized, the IWW should be able to generate enough funds to&#13;
cover all operating costs and debt service obligations and to contribute to future investments.&#13;
Recent Reforms&#13;
2.13  Declining IWW performance is as much a matter of poor organization and management,&#13;
lack of a market orientation, restrictive regulations, and insufficient attention to intermodal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
coordination, as of shallow channels and outdated equipment, vessels and barges. The provincial&#13;
governments in the three project provinces have already begun to recognize the larger problems&#13;
they face, and have: (a) liberalized cargo allocation (no longer controlled by the PCDs);&#13;
(b) improved free entry to the transport system and the related resources (fuel, labor);&#13;
(c) liberalized waterway tariffs (allowing shipping companies to negotiate tariffs within 20 percent&#13;
of those set by the pricing bureaus); and (d) commercialized and corporatized various operations,&#13;
as evidenced by shipping companies, port corporations and shipbuilding industries. These are&#13;
encouraging steps in the right direction.&#13;
2.14 While much more remains to be done (and some remaining challenges, particularly in&#13;
regulatory reform, will require national-level decisions), it is significant that reforms have already&#13;
been initiated in this comparatively neglected part of the transport system. This has occurred due&#13;
to the existence of important conditions favoring development of a market-oriented IWW system&#13;
in China, including: (a) a high level of decentralization; (b) rapid economic development and&#13;
increasing transport demand (in contrast to the situation in most transition economies); (c) the&#13;
acceptance even now of direct user charges (used to finance waterways maintenance and&#13;
construction, lock and port construction), compared to the virtual absence of such fees even in&#13;
parts of the United States and Europe; and (d) a fledgling private sector. Even so, a slow,&#13;
incremental approach to IWW reform must be expected in China, where any change is normally&#13;
tested in various locations before broader innovations are introduced. Incrementalism is also&#13;
inevitable in the IWW, due to the system's highly decentralized operational responsibilities.&#13;
2.15  The proposed project represents a further step in the reform process by supporting&#13;
creation of independent IWW companies and fostering improved financial performance through&#13;
efficiency enhancements and cost-based pricing reforms. IWW organization and management&#13;
would also benefit from the commercialization of operations, backed up by institutional&#13;
development support. As such, the project is intended to demonstrate to other parts of the IWW&#13;
system an approach to, and the benefits of, commercialization. Any subsequent Bank involvement&#13;
in IWW will build on the project's achievements, and further advance our dialogue with the&#13;
Government on the larger regulatory issues affecting IWW efficiency.&#13;
Financial and Organizational Action Plan&#13;
2.16 The three provinces have prepared comprehensivefinancial reform action plans to:&#13;
(a)   Give financial autonomy to IWW agencies and hold them responsible for paying their&#13;
own debts, corporate taxes and other financial obligations;&#13;
(b)   Place IWW operations within a competitive system in order to encourage profitability&#13;
and financial self-sufficiency; and&#13;
(c)   Improve financial management and accounting and business practices to conform to&#13;
international standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
2.17  Achieving these objectives will require:&#13;
(a)   Setting up modern and computer-aided financial accounting and management&#13;
departments conforming to commercial accounting and budgeting standards, equipping&#13;
the department with professionally qualified staff;&#13;
(b)   Applying cost-based pricing policies. Costs will be identified for cost centers and&#13;
expenses will be controlled through the budget system and responsibility accounting;&#13;
(c)   Introducing a new cost-based tariff structure and procedures for revising that structure&#13;
in line with costs;&#13;
(d)   Training staff in financial planning, cash flow management, asset management, costing,&#13;
budgeting, investment planning and in using modern management techniques;&#13;
(e)   Giving entities freedom to hire staff and write technical and operational procedures,&#13;
signing and executing loan agreements for local bank loans; and&#13;
(f)    Developing a sound financial and statistical management information system to serve as&#13;
a decision-making tool for management.&#13;
2.18 Even with the envisioned pricing reforms, the IWW should offer the most economic&#13;
surface transport for moving low-value bulk cargo. The waterways have advantages over other&#13;
transport modes, such as lower operating costs (e.g., 20 to 30 percent lower energy consumption&#13;
than railways) and lower environmental impact. While current IWW operating costs have been&#13;
raised by inadequate maintenance, outdated equipment and poor operations, modernization and&#13;
management improvements like those under the project would reduce costs. This, combined with&#13;
the reduction in pricing distortions on the railways-now a focus of the Bank's sector dialogue,&#13;
would further ensure the waterways' economic advantages. All this will enable the IWW to&#13;
achieve desired tariff increases and still enjoy competitive advantage over other modes.&#13;
2.19  Organizational reforms being pursued involve the gradual establishment in Hunan and&#13;
Guangxi of commercially independent, state-owned corporations to handle the project waterways.&#13;
2.20 Hunan. In December 1994, the Hunan Provincial Communications Department (HPCD)&#13;
established a state-owned corporation (Hunan Xiangjiang Navigation Construction and&#13;
Development Corporation-HXNCDC), which is commercially independent and has full authority&#13;
to employ its own staff and negotiate employment conditions, as well as construction and service&#13;
contracts. The corporation is authorized to implement and operate the proposed project and&#13;
promote and develop the major waterway infrastructure on a commercial basis. HXNCDC's&#13;
organization is satisfactory, and key staff have been appointed. After the project is completed,&#13;
HXNCDC plans to lease out operation of the project's two new channel port facilities in Zhuzhou&#13;
and Hengyang to independent companies.  The organization of HXNCDC during project&#13;
implementation and, thereafter, operations (Charts 1.1 and 1.2) has been reviewed by the Bank&#13;
and is satisfactory. HXNCDC's performance as a commercially independent entity would be&#13;
monitored under the project and, if required, assistance would be provided in problem areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
2.21  Guangxi. In January 1995, the Guangxi Communications Department (GCD) established&#13;
the Xijiang Project Headquarters (XJPH) as the project implementation unit, and the&#13;
organizational chart for the construction period (Chart 1.4) is satisfactory. Although XJPH is not&#13;
free to determine employment conditions for GCD staff, it will have the authority to employ and&#13;
negotiate with additional non-GCD staff, as required. Also, it has the power to negotiate all&#13;
project-related design , construction and supervision contracts. After the project is completed,&#13;
this office will be merged into a new commercially independent company, the Guangxi Waterway&#13;
Development Company (GWDC), which will be responsible for operations and future&#13;
development and management of the waterway system (Chart 1. 5). Establishment of GWDC will&#13;
benefit from experience gained in bringing HXNCDC to full commercial independence. During&#13;
negotiations, it was agreed that by March 1, 2000, Guangxi Province will establish a legal,&#13;
commercially independent company to operate major inland waterway systems in the province&#13;
and ensure that the company adopts operating policies and procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
A charter of incorporation, acceptable to the Bank, will constitute the basis for creating GWDC.&#13;
2.22  Corporatization in the third project province, Zhejiang, has not been sought, since the&#13;
project components are isolated items within the larger IWW systems administered by a variety of&#13;
local governments. Nevertheless, the Zhejiang Provincial Communications Department has&#13;
created a separate agency, the Project Administration Organization (PAO), to implement the&#13;
proposed project (Chart 1.6).  This is expected to reduce the likelihood of government&#13;
interference in project activities. And, to promote a market orientation, the local authorities plan&#13;
to lease out operations of the three port complexes to be developed under the project to&#13;
independent port companies.&#13;
2.23  Time-bound action plans for implementing these reforms, particularly the critical costing&#13;
study and tariff restructuring, have been developed (Annex H). The IWW costing system will be&#13;
designed, developed and installed in each province and local staff will be trained by July 31, 1998.&#13;
Based on the costing system, an improved cost-based tariff structure will be developed and&#13;
submitted to provincial authorities for approval by December 31, 1998. Technical assistance and&#13;
training under the project would support action plan implementation. During negotiationis,&#13;
agreement was reached that Guangxi and Zhejiang Provinces and HXNVCDC would introduce&#13;
institutional reforms and develop a cost accounting system and tariff structure in accordance&#13;
with agreed time-bound action plans.&#13;
D. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
2.24  The focus of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for China, to be discussed&#13;
with the Board on June 1, 1995, is to help alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks, reduce poverty,&#13;
safeguard the environment and introduce macroeconomic and structural reforms. The proposed&#13;
project responds directly to these goals and to our overall sector strategy, to be issued shortly&#13;
(para. 1.23) by: (a) improving and expanding transportation and power generation infrastructure&#13;
where serious supply constraints exist; (b) increasing transport efficiency by providing facilities to&#13;
enhance intermodal linkages; (c) targeting the majority of project investment at two relatively&#13;
poor provinces and designing the investments to bring ancillary benefits to two other poor&#13;
provinces; (d) developing environmentally preferable types of infrastructure; and (e) introducing&#13;
financial and organizational reforms in the IWW sector aimed at commercialization of operations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16 -&#13;
and financial independence. In its direct assistance to relatively poor Hunan and Guangxi, and&#13;
indirect support to Yunnan and Guizhou, the project would promote the Government's objective&#13;
of reducing the significant income imbalance between the fast-growing coastal provinces and&#13;
those inland, particularly in the south and southwest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. OBJEcrivEs&#13;
3.1   The main objectives of the project are to: (a) improve IWW management and introduce&#13;
organizational and financial reforms in line with a market economy; (b) expand IWW capacity by&#13;
widening and deepening channels to improve navigation, which requires constructing dams (in&#13;
Hunan and Guangxi) to increase the water level; (c) improve connections between IWW and land&#13;
transport services by appropriately equipping IWW ports; (d) generate hydroelectric power by&#13;
utilizing the differential heads at the dams; and (e) enhance the capabilities of the IWW entities.&#13;
Two of the project provinces-Hunan and Guangxi-are relatively poor, and project investments&#13;
are expected to promote economic development there by helping to create new jobs, increase&#13;
incomes and reduce poverty. The project's multisectoral strategy is consistent with the financial&#13;
goals of the Government's IWW reform policies, and addresses the lack of intersectoral&#13;
coordination that reduced the IWW network in the past.&#13;
B. DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.2   Project works would include:&#13;
(a)   in Zhejiang, improvement of four major IWW channels and construction of IWW/&#13;
land transport links at three ports;&#13;
(b)   in Hunan, construction of a dam and shiplock, upgrading of the main IWW&#13;
channel, construction of a hydropower generation facility at the dam, and&#13;
expansion of two ports; and&#13;
(c)   in Guangxi, construction of a dam and shiplock, upgrading of the main IWW&#13;
channel, and construction of a hydropower generation facility at the dam.&#13;
Project power plants would share in the total costs of the shiplock system and allow the project&#13;
agencies to cover their debt service obligations for the project and to become financially self-&#13;
sufficient.&#13;
3.3   The investment components would be complemented by the provision of technical&#13;
assistance (TA) and training to enhance subsector institutional capabilities in the project provinces&#13;
for, inter alia, project implementation and institutional reforms.&#13;
Investment Component&#13;
3.4   Zhejiang Province. Works in Zhejiang (estimated to cost about $99 million, including&#13;
contingencies) would be carried out in the commercially important northeastern part of the&#13;
province. IWW density in this area is one of the highest in China, and links all major local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
production centers to Shanghai. In 1992, the area waterways carried 61.2 million tons and had a&#13;
turnover volume of 7.1 billion t.km, or about 78 percent and 52 percent of the total transport&#13;
volume and turnover of the railway, highways and waterways in the area. Despite the high traffic&#13;
levels, most of the waterways in the area have not been improved. Channels are narrow and&#13;
shallow (at not more than 30 m wide and 3 m deep), permitting passage only to small-tonnage&#13;
vessels (50-100 t), the clear-span of overcrossing bridges is relatively low, the inland ports are&#13;
inadequate, and management of the waterways is deficient. Navigation tie-ups owing to these&#13;
conditions have, among other things, completely blocked the channel system 114 times during&#13;
1992-93, interrupted the coal supply to the Hangzhou thermal power plant, which was forced to&#13;
stop operations, delayed delivery of construction materials to Shanghai, which suffered&#13;
construction stoppages at nearly 1,000 sites, and in general have caused serious economic losses&#13;
to the whole area served by the waterway system.&#13;
3.5   Transport constraints would be reduced through investments to expand the capacity of&#13;
three channels and the Grand Canal to vessels of about 300 tons, works at the ports of Huzhou,&#13;
Jiaxing and Hangzhou to improve their linkages with land transportation, and provision of cargo-&#13;
handling equipment for the three ports.&#13;
3.6   Four major waterways would be improved by widening/deepening a total of 182 km of&#13;
narrow or shallow sections and renovating or constructing a total of 29 bridges:&#13;
(a)   Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal: 54 km of this 100-km section of the Grand Canal&#13;
to be improved and four bridges built.&#13;
(b)   Changxing-Huzhou-Shanghai Channel:  13 km of the 95-km channel to be&#13;
improved and three bridges built.&#13;
(c)   Hangzhou-Shanghai Channel: 72 km of the 141-km channel to be improved and&#13;
10 bridges built.&#13;
(d)   Zhapu-Jiaxing-Suzhou Channel: 43 km of the 57-km channel to be improved and&#13;
12 bridges built.&#13;
3.7   Port connections to land transportation would be improved by constructing two new&#13;
rail/road and IWW transshipment centers at Huzhou and Jiaxing and one inland bulk cargo facility&#13;
with a road at Hangzhou:&#13;
(a)   Hangzhou Port, one of China's 23 key inland ports and in 1992 handling 15.5&#13;
million tons, currently has 212 berths (of which 23 are for barges of 300 dwt).&#13;
Under the project, Hangzhou Port's bulk cargo-handling facilities would be&#13;
relocated from the city center, where transshipment to the highway is inconvenient,&#13;
to an area north of the city to be linked directly to the highway. Twenty berths for&#13;
100 dwt and three berths for 300 dwt would be provided.&#13;
(b)   Jiaxing Port, which handled 4.4 million tons of cargo in 1992, has 235 berths, the&#13;
largest of which is for 120 dwt. The railway-waterway transfer facility at the&#13;
Jiaxing railway station is already overloaded and will further constrain traffic flows&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
when an ongoing expansion of the area railway is completed. The project would&#13;
therefore provide a new rail-water transfer facility to the east of the station,&#13;
comprising 13 berths for 100 dwt and 2 berths for 300 dwt.&#13;
(c)   Huzhou Port handled 7.7 million tons of cargo in 1992, with 160 berths, the&#13;
largest for 150 dwt. Ongoing capacity increases in the railway, highway and&#13;
waterway networks in the Huzhou area will require considerable expansion of the&#13;
existing capacity for intermodal transfers. The project would provide a railway-&#13;
waterway transfer terminal at the port, comprising 10 berths for 100 dwt and one&#13;
berth for 300 dwt.&#13;
3.8   Modem cargo-handling equipment would be provided under the project to increase&#13;
productivity and efficiency at the three project ports.&#13;
3.9   Hunan Province. In this landlocked province, improvements (estimated to cost some&#13;
$212 million) would be made to the main waterbome traffic artery, the Xiangjiang River, which&#13;
links the province and five of its important industrial cities to the Yangtze River system. The&#13;
Xiangiang carries most of the approximately 6 percent share of freight conveyed by all the&#13;
provincial waterways. Various studies of the Yangtze system and of the Xiangjiang have&#13;
recommended works to improve navigation on the Xiangjiang (and thereby relieve transport&#13;
constraints in all modes, but particularly the railway, being experienced in the province) and to&#13;
exploit its power generation potential. Until recently, the river could not be used by vessels larger&#13;
than 300 dwt. The first phase of navigational improvements to the Xiangjiang was carried out in&#13;
1989-94, with the dredging of the Zhuzhou-Chenglingji section (257 km) to permit navigation by&#13;
1,000 dwt barges from Shanghai to Hunan via the Yangtze. The proposed project would finance&#13;
the second phase of river development between Zhuzhou and the industrial city of Hengyang&#13;
(182 km), including:&#13;
(a)   Construction of an 13-m high low-head dam and shiplock at Dayuandu (62 km&#13;
downstream of Hengyang City) to raise the water level upstream to permit&#13;
navigation by 1,000 dwt barges. Inundation protection facilities, an access road,&#13;
bridge and administrative buildings would also be constructed;&#13;
(b)   Removal of shoals and construction of river training works to facilitate navigation&#13;
between Dayuandu and Zhuzhou (120 km);&#13;
(c)   Construction of a hydropower generation facility at the dam, with a capacity of&#13;
120 MW (four units of 30 MW each) and average yearly generated energy of&#13;
about 480 GWh. About 80 km of transmission lines are also included. A detailed&#13;
description of the plant is given in Annex A;&#13;
(d)   Provision of power generating equipment, flood and lock gates and other related&#13;
items, as well as handling equipment, navigational aids and markers, and&#13;
telecommunications hardware; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
(e)   Construction of a general cargo berth and two coal berths at Zhuzhou Port, and&#13;
three general cargo berths at Hengyang Port-all suitable for 1,000 dwt capacity&#13;
barges.&#13;
3.10  Guangxi Province. In Guangxi, the project would continue works to improve navigation&#13;
on the province's previously neglected main inland waterway, the Xijiang River, and to develop&#13;
its power generation capacity. With completion of dredging of one river section, a 581-km&#13;
channel in the Xijiang and Pearl Rivers will be navigable by 1,000 dwt barges from Guigang in the&#13;
east to Guangzhou and the sea in the west. Project works to develop the river from Guigang to&#13;
Nanning (estimated to cost some $246 million) would increase channel capacity from 120 dwt at&#13;
present to 1,000 dwt, help relieve continuing congestion on the rail line that now carries most&#13;
bulk traffic through the area, and support development of this relatively poor province by&#13;
facilitating shipping of coal, phosphate and other industrial and agricultural products to&#13;
Guangdong Province. The project waterway will also link up to the Nanning-Kunming railway as&#13;
well as a major highway, both still under construction, which will extend the benefits of IWW&#13;
development to Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces. The proposed works are therefore expected to&#13;
aid development of all three of China's traditionally disadvantaged southwestern provinces.&#13;
3.11  The project would finance the following:&#13;
(a)   Construction of a 14-m high low-head dam and shiplock at Guigang to raise the&#13;
water level upstream as well as construction of inundation protection facilities, an&#13;
access road, bridge and adrninistrative buildings;&#13;
(b)   Removal of shoals and construction of river training works to facilitate navigation&#13;
between Guigang and Nanning;&#13;
(c)   Construction of a hydropower generation facility at the dam, with a capacity of&#13;
120 MW  (four units of 30 MW  each) and average yearly generated energy of&#13;
600 GWh. About 60 km of transmission lines are also included. A detailed&#13;
description of the plant is given in Annex A; and&#13;
(d)   Provision of power generating equipment, flood and lock gates and other related&#13;
items, as well as telecommunications hardware.&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training Component&#13;
3.12  In all three project provinces, technical assistance (TA) and training would be provided to&#13;
establish an adequate administrative organization for the provinces' IWW transport, and improve&#13;
the capacity of IWW entities to formulate policy, implement the project, introduce institutional&#13;
(organizational and financial) reforms (paras. 2.13-2.23) and enhance environmental protection&#13;
(see Annex B). Consultants will advise on and provide on-the-job training in construction&#13;
supervision, procurement and contracts, financial and cost accounting, tariff setting, economic&#13;
evaluation, IWW/port maintenance and administration, environmental protection and IWW&#13;
planning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
3.13  In view of past neglect of this subsector and the need for significant development of staff&#13;
capacities to plan, manage and maintain the IWW and to carry out the financial and organizational&#13;
reforms, the project includes substantial training. Formal training of project staff will be offered&#13;
overseas and locally, the latter provided by foreign experts and foreign-trained Chinese staff. A&#13;
formal selection procedure for candidates to be trained will be developed by IWW authorities of&#13;
each province. Overall, the project would provide for a total of about 750 person-months of&#13;
domestic training, 383 person-months of overseas training and 48 person-months of TA. During&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached that Guangxi and Zhejiang provinces and HXNCDC would&#13;
carry out training according to time-bound action plans satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
C. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.14  The total cost of the project is estimated at $556.8 million, of which $210.0 million&#13;
represents the foreign exchange component (38 percent of the project cost). Cost estimates&#13;
reflect December 1994 prices and are based on the recent tendering information available for&#13;
similar projects, including the price of bids for civil works and power generating equipment.&#13;
Physical contingencies for civil works are calculated at 5 percent in Hunan and Guangxi and&#13;
10 percent in Zhejiang; for equipment, at 10 percent for all provinces. Price contingencies for&#13;
foreign costs are calculated according to anticipated international price increases of 2.9 percent&#13;
for 1995, 3.0 percent for 1996, 2.7 percent for 1997 and 1998, and 2.5 percent for 1999 and&#13;
2000. The price increase for local costs is calculated according to projected domestic inflation&#13;
rates of 14.0 percent for 1995, 10.5 percent for 1996, 8.5 percent for 1997, 7.0 percent for 1998,&#13;
6.5 percent for 1999, and 6.2 percent for 2000. The cost of civil works is based on work&#13;
quantities calculated from final engineering designs. The cost of equipment was estimated based&#13;
on prevailing prices and quotations from manufacturers and suppliers. The cost of consulting&#13;
services is based on recent costs and MOC estimates. The foreign exchange component would&#13;
cover: (a) dams, shiplocks and channel and river ports civil works; (b) power generators, locks,&#13;
cargo handling and telecommunications equipment; and (c) TA and training. Project costs are&#13;
summarized below and given in detail in Table 3.1.&#13;

3.15   The proposed Bank loan of $210 million represents 38 percent of total project costs or&#13;
100 percent of foreign costs. The central, provincial and municipal governments will provide a&#13;
capital contribution of 57 percent of total project costs or $319.3 million. The remaining $27.5&#13;
million or about 5 percent will be obtained from a local bank loan. During negotiations,&#13;
assurances were obtained that the Borrower, the Project Provinces and HXNCDC would&#13;
promptly provide the funds as needed for the project. An understanding was also obtained on&#13;
the indicative financing plan. The financing plan for the three provinces is as follows:&#13;

3.16  The proceeds of the Bank loan would be allocated to the three Project Provinces on the&#13;
same terms and conditions as the Bank loan, with the provinces bearing the foreign exchange risk&#13;
between the Renminbi and the US dollar. Since Hunan has created an IWW company (the Hunan&#13;
Xiangjiang Navigation, Construction and Development Corporation, HXNCDC), the Hunan&#13;
portion of the Bank loan would be relent to HXNCDC by Hunan Province on the same terms as&#13;
above. Onlending arrangements to HXNCDC are shown in Chart 1.3. During negotiations,&#13;
assurances on loan onlending arrangements were obtainedfrom the Borrower andfrom Hunan&#13;
Province. Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between Hunan Province and HXNCDC is&#13;
a condition of loan effectiveness.&#13;
D. ILEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
3.17  The project would be carried out by the Zhejiang Project Administration Office (PAO),&#13;
HXNCDC, and the Guangxi Provincial Communications Department (PCD). Because the project&#13;
involves three provinces, implementation will be complex and require well-planned coordination.&#13;
To monitor it adequately, a project implementation liaison group has been established to facilitate&#13;
implementation and coordination with the Bank on all aspects of implementation such as reporting&#13;
to and corresponding with the Bank and coordinating TA, training, procurement and other&#13;
administrative work. The group will be headed by MOC and comprise the Deputy Executive of&#13;
the Zhejiang PCD (who is also Director of the PAO), the Chairman and General Manager of&#13;
EEXNCDC Ltd., and the Deputy Executive of the Guangxi PCD.&#13;
3.18  The project is scheduled to be completed by December 31, 2000, with a loan closing date&#13;
of June 30, 2001. The Hunan and Guangxi hydropower plants are expected to begin full&#13;
operation in early 2001. The implementation schedule is shown in Table 3.2.&#13;
E. PRocuREMENT&#13;

3.20 Civil Works. The project's civil works will be carried out under international competitive&#13;
bidding (ICB) and national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. The&#13;
dams and shiplocks for Hunan will be procured through ICB. Qualified domestic contractors will&#13;
be eligible for a margin of preference in the comparison of ICB bids of 7.5 percent.&#13;
Prequalification procedures following Bank guidelines will be required. A preliminary works&#13;
contract for dam construction (at $2.1 million) will be procured through NCB without the&#13;
prequalification procedure. The dam and shiplock of Guangxi will not be Bank-financed and will&#13;
therefore follow Provincial Government's procedures.&#13;
3.21  In Zhejiang, three civil works contracts for constructing ports (with an estimated total&#13;
value of $21.0 million), and contracts for improving channels (with an estimated value of $60.3&#13;
million) would be awarded following NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Three contracts,&#13;
for inundation control structures for Guangxi, would also be procured through NCB. Foreign&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
bidders are unlikely to be interested in bidding for these works, since they are labor-intensive,&#13;
contract values are not large, and local prices are well below those of the intemational market.&#13;
Further, Chinese contractors are well-experienced and competent in carrying out such&#13;
construction. If foreign firms wish to participate in NCB for these works, they would be allowed&#13;
to do so in accordance with local procedures that are acceptable to the Bank and considered&#13;
appropriate for the efficient execution of the project.&#13;
3.22 Equipment. Major equipment, including two sets of four 30-MW generators, one set&#13;
each for Hunan and Guangxi, and a sounder in Zhejiang (total estimated cost of $158.2 million)&#13;
will be procured through ICB. Goods manufactured in China will be eligible for a preference (in&#13;
bid evaluation) of 15 percent of the c.i.f price or the actual import duty, whichever is lower.&#13;
Goods for Zhejiang estimated to cost less than $300,000 per contract up to an aggregate not&#13;
exceeding $3.4 million may be procured under NCB procedures. All other items or groups of&#13;
items covering minor equipment, estimated at less than $200,000 per contract and in aggregate&#13;
not exceeding $2.0 million, would be procured under shopping procedures, on the basis of price&#13;
quotations solicited from at least three suppliers eligible under the Bank Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement.&#13;
3.23  Items not financed by the Bank, including civil works, miscellaneous local materials and&#13;
equipment, would be procured according to Government procedures. However, in order to&#13;
satisfy quality standards, a Bank review (that would also include procurement procedures), for&#13;
major local components is required. During negotiations, it was agreed that the Bank will review&#13;
the qualifications of the company to be awarded the contract for the dam and shiplocks in&#13;
Guangxi.&#13;
3.24 Bank Review. All contracts over $3.0 million for works and $500,000 for goods&#13;
financed from the loan will be subject to prior review by the Bank (98 percent of Bank-funded&#13;
purchases). All consultants' contracts over $50,000 for individuals and $100,000 for firms&#13;
financed by the Bank would be subject to prior review by the Bank. All consultants financed from&#13;
the proceeds of the loan will be selected and employed in accordance with 'Bank Guidelines on&#13;
the Use of Consultants."&#13;
3.25 Advance Contracting. Zhejiang and Hunan provinces requested advance contracting and&#13;
retroactive financing for civil works for the construction of two ports and dams/shiplocks. This&#13;
would allow the provinces to expedite the project. The amount subject to retroactive financing is&#13;
estimated at about $12.0 million, with $3.5 million to Zhejiang and $8.5 million for Hunan. These&#13;
amounts would apply to payments made after January 1, 1995.&#13;
F. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.26 Disbursements from the loan would cover:&#13;
(a)   47 percent of total expenditures for civil works;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
(b)    100 percent of total expenditures for directly imported goods and equipment,&#13;
100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured goods and&#13;
equipment, and 75 percent of local expenditures for other items procured locally;&#13;
(c)    100 percent of total expenditures for consulting services and training.&#13;
3.27  To facilitate disbursement, three Special Accounts (one for each province) will be opened&#13;
in a bank acceptable to the Bank, with an authorized allocation of $3.0 million each for Hunan&#13;
and Guangxi, and $2.0 million for Zhejiang, which is the estimated average expenditure for four&#13;
months. Applications for replenishment will be submitted monthly or when the account is drawn&#13;
down by 50 percent, whichever occurs first. A schedule of estimated disbursements is provided in&#13;
Table 3.4.&#13;
3.28  Disbursements will be made against priced contracts for the civil works and supply and&#13;
installation of equipment and goods. Interim certification of civil works payments will be&#13;
authorized by the head engineer (of the supervision consultants) or deputy representative.&#13;
Disbursements for staff training in China and abroad will be made against the actual costs of travel&#13;
expenses and tuition or training fees. Disbursements would be made against statements of&#13;
expenditures (SEs) for:  (a) contracts for works costing less than $3.0 mnillion equivalent;&#13;
(b) contracts for equipment costing less than $500,000 equivalent; (c) contracts for consulting&#13;
services costing less than $100,000 equivalent for firms and $50,000 equivalent for individuals;&#13;
and (d) training. Documentation supporting the statements of expenditures would be retained by&#13;
the implementing agencies and made available for review by Bank supervision missions.&#13;
G. PROJECT SUPERVISION AND MONITORING&#13;
3.29  The project will be supervised more intensively in the initial stages of implementation, and&#13;
periodically after that. A mid-term review would be carried out to assess the need for mid-course&#13;
corrections and, in particular, to take stock of progress in implementing the reform action plan&#13;
and in institutional development activities. Supervision staff time is estimated at about 70 staff-&#13;
weeks over the implementation period, including the preparation of the Implementation&#13;
Completion Report (Annex C). In addition to field supervision, the progress of project elements&#13;
will be monitored through quarterly reports submitted to the Bank.  During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached with the Borrower on a mid-term review to be held by May 15, 1998.&#13;
3.30  Because the project includes three provinces and sites in each are scattered, a higher&#13;
supervision input than usual is anticipated. The focus of Bank supervision efforts in the first year&#13;
would be on procurement of civil works and major equipment, monitoring of the institutional&#13;
reform, compliance with legal covenants, and implementation of action plans. Supervision would&#13;
also focus on the creation of the project implementation units, coordination of civil works, the&#13;
procurement process, financial management, tariff setting, TA and training (Annex C).&#13;
3.31   Since there are no alternative navigable channels in the three provinces, it is important that&#13;
project implementation will not impede IWW  traffic.  Supervision will thus ensure that:&#13;
(a) channel improvements are accomplished in a way that does not hamper the movement of&#13;
barges (in Zhejiang); and (b) the channel is switched to the shiplock once the dam is completed,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
various components are well coordinated and traffic is not slowed substantially (in Hunan and&#13;
Guangxi).&#13;
3.32  Monitoring. In order to monitor the project's progress and effectiveness, beneficiary&#13;
agencies will submit the following periodic reports during implementation to the coordinating&#13;
committee, which will review and consolidate them into a single report to be sent to the Bank.&#13;
These will include (a) audited reports for the project accounts and agencies' financial statements&#13;
within six months of the close of the Government's fiscal year, and six-month financial reports on&#13;
project expenditures, disbursements, financial performance of the IWW operations and status of&#13;
loan proceeds; and (b) quarterly progress reports for each investment item (including procurement&#13;
of goods and services, TA and training in each of the components). In addition, during&#13;
supervision, operating indicators (Annex D) will be monitored to assess the region's economic&#13;
growth. During negotiations, it was agreed that Guangxi and Zhejiang Provinces and HXNCDC&#13;
willfurnish quarterly, annual and mid-term progress reports to the Bank and, upon completion&#13;
of the project, each Project Province will prepare an Implementation Completion Report aCR)&#13;
no later than six months after the loan closing date.&#13;
H. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
3.33  This is a Category A project. Environmental assessments (EAs) were carried out for&#13;
Zhejiang, Hunan and Guangxi project components. EAs for the four channels and three ports&#13;
under the Zhejiang project component were completed in March 1993 by the Zhejiang&#13;
Environmental Protection Institute and the Zhejiang Design Institute of Environmental Protection&#13;
of Light Industry. Based on the EAs and discussions with Bank staff, environmental action plans&#13;
(EAPs) for the seven subcomponents were prepared by the Zhejiang Provincial Communications&#13;
Department and submitted to the Bank in January 1994. An EA for the Hunan project component&#13;
was carried out by Hunan University and completed in August 1993. Based on its findings, an&#13;
EAP was prepared by the Hunan Provincial Communications Department and submitted to the&#13;
Bank in January 1994. An EA for the Guangxi project component was carried out by the&#13;
Guangxi Electric Industry Design Institute in 1990-91. An EA report, including supplementary&#13;
information to meet the Bank's requirements, an EAP and an Environmental Monitoring Plan&#13;
were prepared by consultants and submitted to the Bank in February 1994. EA summaries of the&#13;
Zhejiang, Hunan and Guangxi project components were submitted to the Bank in May 1994. The&#13;
EAs, EA summaries and EAPs were revised during the appraisal mission in November/December&#13;
1994. The final EA summaries and EAPs were submitted to the Bank in January 1995 and found&#13;
satisfactory.&#13;
3.34  The process of environmental review involved inputs from various units in the region,&#13;
including those from provincial and local environmental protection bureaus, research institutions&#13;
and universities. The affected groups and people subject to resettlement, in particular, have been&#13;
consulted. The three provincial governments made it known to the public that EIA documents&#13;
are placed in their offices where they are available to all interested parties for review.&#13;
3.35  A number of potential impacts were identified. With regard to channel upgrading in&#13;
Zhejiang, land acquisition, dredging, water pollution, ship wastes and noise could present&#13;
problems. Regarding port improvements in Zhejiang and Hunan, wastewater and solid wastes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
from ships and port activities, drinking water intake, wastewater, dust from coalyards and noise&#13;
and air pollution including that due to increased land traffic, could be problematic. Regarding&#13;
dam construction in Hunan and Guangxi, impacts on the ecology and cultural relics, water quality&#13;
in reservoir areas and downstream, danger to fish and fish migration, and changed hydrological&#13;
regimes could present major problems. Regarding IWW regulations and shoal removal in Hunan&#13;
and Guangxi, the effects of blasting and turbidity from shoal removal on fish and aquatic culture&#13;
are potential problems. For each of these, the EAPs offered mitigation measures.&#13;
3.36 The major mitigation measures for the Zhejiang component include the following&#13;
provisions:&#13;
(a)   The land to be acquired for channel widening was selected in a way that would&#13;
minimize land acquisition and the relocation of houses.&#13;
(b)   There is no heavily or moderately contaminated sediment in the sections to be&#13;
dredged and no water intake for drinking water, irrigation or fish breeding along&#13;
the proposed channels.  However, in order to prevent the tributaries from&#13;
becoming contaminated, temporary coffer dams will be constructed where&#13;
appropriate and strict water quality monitoring will be undertaken during dredging.&#13;
To avoid pollution of the drinking water, etc., contaminated sediments will be&#13;
disposed of in approved landfills and covered with clean soil.&#13;
(c)   Comprehensive water pollution control plans for urban areas were drafted by&#13;
municipal governments and are now being reviewed by provincial authorities. In&#13;
line with these plans, the Province will: (i) take steps to prevent noise and disposal&#13;
of oily water and other wastes from vessels, (ii) construct ship-waste treatment&#13;
facilities, (iii) introduce a prior approval system for transporting hazardous&#13;
materials to prevent spills from vessels, and (iv) construct adequate access roads&#13;
for increased land traffic.&#13;
3.37 The major mitigation measures for the Hunan component include the following:&#13;
(a)   Careful consideration was given to the location and design of the Dayuandu Dam&#13;
and reinforcement of flood control dikes in order to minimize the size of the&#13;
inundated area. Drainage systems will be upgraded where necessary to mitigate&#13;
the impacts of changed hydrological regimes.&#13;
(b)   In 23 shoals, rocks, gravel and coarse sand will be removed for river regulation&#13;
works. The materials to be dredged are well sorted in large and medium sizes and&#13;
are not contaminated. In order to prevent turbidity and impacts on fish, shoals will&#13;
be removed in winter (to avoid the fish migration season), and amounts to be&#13;
removed will be limited.&#13;
(c)   To protect fish resources, a fish ladder will be constructed at the Dayuandu Darn&#13;
so as not to disturb migration. The project will also promote fish production in the&#13;
new reservoir area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
(d)   The Hunan Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) developed a&#13;
comprehensive water pollution control plan for the Xiangjiang River in 1992, to&#13;
protect existing water use and improve river water quality. In line with this plan,&#13;
the Province will:  (i) take steps to ensure proper disposal of ship wastes;&#13;
(ii) construct wastewater treatment facilities for ship wastes, wastewater from&#13;
coalyards, etc.; (iii) relocate industrial wastewater outfalls; (iv) introduce a system&#13;
to prevent spill of hazardous substances from vessels; and (v) construct adequate&#13;
access roads for increased land traffic.&#13;
3.38  The major mitigation measures for the Guangxi component include the following:&#13;
(a)   Careful consideration was given to the location and design of the Guigang Dam&#13;
and reinforcement of flood control dikes in order to limit the size of the inundated&#13;
area, which was reduced to approximately 40 percent of the original plan.&#13;
Drainage systems will be upgraded where necessary to mitigate the impacts of&#13;
changed hydrological regimes.&#13;
(b)   Guangxi Environmental Protection Bureau, in cooperation with local EPBs, is&#13;
promoting wastewater control from existing pollution sources. Also, the project&#13;
includes measures such as strict control of ship-waste disposal and treatment, and&#13;
control of noise from vessels. The Guigang waterworks inlet will be relocated&#13;
upstream of the Guigang Dam to substantially improve drinking water quality.&#13;
(c)   Although shoal removal under the proposed project is very limited, it will be&#13;
carried out in an appropriate season, and the activities will be limited in scale to&#13;
reduce impacts on fish and fish migration.&#13;
(d)   Cultural relics will be removed from sites to be inundated or will be elevated above&#13;
the maximum water level, as noted in the project plan.&#13;
3.39  Besides the above, other mitigation measures (such as water spray and wastewater&#13;
treatment for coal, protection against noise and soil erosion) were included in the EAP for the&#13;
design, construction and operation phases. Also, it was ascertained that the project would not&#13;
affect ecologically sensitive areas.&#13;
3.40  The EAPs specified the measures, monitoring and institutional arrangements required to&#13;
mitigate potential environmental impacts during the construction and operation of the project.&#13;
Administrative arrangements will be established to ensure that measures are enforced.  A&#13;
summary of the EAs and EAPs is presented in Annex E and copies of these reports are available&#13;
in the Project File. Agreements were reached during negotiations that Zhejiang, Hunan and&#13;
Guangxi Provinces and HXNCDC will carry out their respective parts of the project in&#13;
accordance with EAPs satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
I. LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
3.41  General. The project includes a range of waterway improvement components in three&#13;
provinces that involves some relocation and resettlement. The project will acquire a total land&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
area of 806 ha (12,086 mu) and affect a total of 12,458 people, of whom 2,295 would be&#13;
physically relocated. Resettlement action plans (RAPs) have been reviewed by the Bank and were&#13;
found satisfactory. During negotiations agreement was reached that resettlement will be carried&#13;
out in accordance with resettlement plans acceptable to the Bank. Details of resettlement are&#13;
provided in Annex F and are summarized below.&#13;
3.42 Dayuandu Navigation Complex (Hunan). The proposed dam and shiplock will&#13;
inundate a total of 72 ha (1,080 mu) of land area, which involves relocating 77 households (383&#13;
people). A total of 17,823 m2 of floor space will be demolished. All relocated households will be&#13;
moved to a new settlement site within the existing village. Among those affected, about 190&#13;
farmers will require alternative employment due to significant land loss. According to the RAP,&#13;
most of them will be provided nonfarm jobs in local township-run factories.&#13;
3.43  Port Expansion in Zhuzhou and Hengyang (Hunan). Expansion of the port facilities in&#13;
Zhuzhou and Hengyang will require acquisition of 7.87 ha (118 mu) of land within the urban area&#13;
and relocation of 102 urban families or 327 persons. Following the well-established urban&#13;
resettlement process in China, the relocated families will be given new apartments that will be&#13;
built within 2 km of the existing site.&#13;
3.44 Guigang Navigation Complex (Guangxi). The proposed dam and shiplock will involve&#13;
land acquisition and resettlement (caused by the dam site construction) and inundation. For the&#13;
dam site, a total of 101 ha (1,509 mu) of land area will be needed, some of which was already&#13;
acquired and involved relocating seven households (30 people). During construction, many&#13;
villagers will be affected: As many as 368 households or 1,560 persons will be given&#13;
nonagricultural status. Among them, 914 people will be assigned new nonfarm jobs by the&#13;
Guigang city government. A detailed employment plan has been developed, which identified 10&#13;
city companies to provide permanent employment in the next three years. During the transition&#13;
period, these people will be provided temporary employment at the construction site. For the&#13;
reservoir area, the project will inundate a total of 460 ha (6,904 mu) of land, of which about&#13;
60 percent is cultivated. Because of land loss, 4,740 farmers will need alternative employment. A&#13;
detailed income restoration scheme was developed that ranges from creating new farmland and&#13;
planting fruit trees to nonfarm employment in county-run factories.&#13;
3.45 Canal Widening and Port Expansion (Zhejiang). The proposed project component&#13;
consists of seven smaller projects that mainly involve channel widening and port expansion for&#13;
three cities in Zhejiang. According to the RAP, these projects will permanently acquire 165 ha&#13;
(2,475 mu) of land and relocate 514 households (1,555 people) by demolishing 123,663 m2 of&#13;
floor space. Most of the households affected will be compensated and given a house plot within&#13;
the same village. The loss of land will also affect 4,272 farmers. According to the compensation&#13;
policies, they will be given either new farmland or alternative employment. As many as 3,960 will&#13;
be assisted through land readjustment within their villages: 312 farmers (mostly due to port&#13;
construction in Huzhou, Jiaxing and Hangzhou) will be given nonfarm employment. In addition&#13;
to the permanent land acquisition, during project construction, another 261 ha (3,909 mu) of land&#13;
might be leased for temporary use and soil pilings. Compensation will be paid to cover the annual&#13;
yield loss and cost of restoring the soil to its original condition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
3.46  Resettlement Strategy. A major objective of project design and planning has been to&#13;
minimize the scope of resettlement. Where land acquisition or demolition is unavoidable, proper&#13;
compensation and , where appropriate, resettlement will be made. The 2,295 persons displaced&#13;
by the projects in the three provinces will be able to rebuild their houses within their own villages&#13;
or, for city residents displaced by the port components, will be resettled in newly built apartment&#13;
buildings with modern facilities in nearby new housing districts. Farmers losing land will be&#13;
provided with similar land for farming or fruit tree planting, or nonfarm jobs at local township and&#13;
village enterprises. Annex F provides details on the legal framework for resettlement and&#13;
compensation practices, as well as a summary of completed RAPs.&#13;
3.47  Resettlement Cost. Preliminary estimates of relocation and resettlement costs, included&#13;
in the overall cost estimate, are Y 221.3 million, excluding contingencies.&#13;
3.48  Monitoring and Evaluation. Project offices in the three provinces have appointed three&#13;
independent research institutions to monitor resettlement. They are the Mid-South Hydroelectric&#13;
Design and Research Institute for the Hunan subproject, the Guangxi Electric Power Design and&#13;
Survey Institute for the Guangxi subproject, and the Population and Development Research&#13;
Institute of Hangzhou University for the Zhejiang subproject. Preliminary working plans are&#13;
included in the RAPs. The objective of monitoring and evaluation is to ensure that resettlement is&#13;
implemented smoothly and that living conditions and incomes are improved or at least fully&#13;
restored.&#13;
J. DAM SAFETY CONTROL&#13;
3.49  In accordance with Bank guidelines, a Dam Safety Panel was created to review the&#13;
concepts of the dams and their associated structures to ensure the safety of the dams through their&#13;
design, implementation, operations and maintenance. Panel members and their terms of reference&#13;
are satisfactory to the Bank. The project has been carefully examined and well-coordinated by the&#13;
involved agencies. A coffer dam break analysis was carried out to identify the potentially affected&#13;
areas downstream. The Dam Safety Panel will conduct periodic reviews during construction to&#13;
examine whether changes in the designs of the dams are necessary. Appropriate instruments will&#13;
be used to monitor all movements and settlement deflations of any possible deficiency in the dams&#13;
and their structures. Based on an action plan, the panel will monitor dam safety during the&#13;
construction and operation phases, particularly the possible impact of heavy floods and other&#13;
critical aspects. Agreements to this effect were obtained during negotiations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
4. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A. INIRODUCTION&#13;
4.1   The proposed project activities are expected to have significant impacts on the economies&#13;
of the project provinces. By relieving serious river transport bottlenecks in an economically&#13;
important area in Zhejiang Province and allowing passage of much larger vessels, the project&#13;
would support further, more efficient development of this already thriving region. Project&#13;
investments to open up landlocked portions of less-well-off Hunan and Guangoi Provinces to&#13;
much larger volumes of river traffic, and to link them to booming downstream areas like Shanghai&#13;
and Guangdong, should result in major social and economic benefits, including job creation and&#13;
increased industrial development. IWW development in Guangxi should also significantly benefit&#13;
the relatively poor neighboring provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou.&#13;
4.2   The project developments by province and component are as follows:&#13;
TI'E PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
Dams /a     Channels      Ports&#13;
Hunan                    1            -           2&#13;
Guangxi                  1           -&#13;
Zhejiang                 -           4            3&#13;
Total                 2           4            5&#13;
/a Including construction of shiplocks and power stations.&#13;
The main quantifiable benefits of these investments are: (a) avoiding costly traffic diversion from&#13;
IWW to road/rail by implementing the project; (b) savings in cargo-handling costs, ship waiting&#13;
and operating time, and cargo time due to improved cargo handling; (c) savings in unit transport&#13;
costs by using larger-size barges; and (d) supply of additional electricity to the area consumers.&#13;
The overall economic rate of return is estimated at over 22 percent.&#13;
B. TRAFFIC&#13;
4.3   Zhejiang. In 1992, the IWW system in the project carried 61.2 million tons of cargo or&#13;
37.5 percent of total tonnage transported by rail, highway and IWW combined. As the area does&#13;
not have coal, 50 percent of imported coal is transported through the IWW via Shanghai. Also,&#13;
over 50 percent of construction materials (sand and stone) used in Shanghai were supplied from&#13;
the province. The traffic pattern can be characterized as follows: (a) the city of Shanghai is the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
origin or destination of most cargo; (b) very basic commodities, dry-bulk cargo (coal-in,&#13;
construction material and nonretallic ores-out) constitute over 80 percent of channel traffic;&#13;
(c) all major local cities, factories and transport centers in this area can be linked by the IWW; and&#13;
(d) the transport capacity of the channels and traffic growth of the ports are closely related and&#13;
should be treated as an integrated transport system. Since the cargo on the channel has long&#13;
exceeded its original capacity, growth is impossible; consequently the actual traffic growth rate is&#13;
very low, about 1.1 to 1.8 percent a year from 1980 to 1993. With the proposed project, it is&#13;
estimated that demand will absorb all the incremental channel transport capacity in the first few&#13;
years after opening. In the long term, traffic is conservatively estimated to grow from 1.1 percent&#13;
a year to 2.0 percent between 2000 and 2020, with the project; without it, the IWW would be&#13;
totally blocked, bringing much higher social and economic costs. The project involves three port&#13;
development plans that involve expanding the IWW district of Hangzhou Port and building two&#13;
transshipment centers (one at Huzhou and one at Jiaxing). Since these ports are part of the same&#13;
IWW system, the traffic pattern, except for the rail and highway portion, will not be very different&#13;
from that of the channel. For a detailed analysis, see Annex G.&#13;
4.4   Hunan. In 1993, the Dayuandu area, the site of the proposed project dam, shipped about&#13;
2.0 million tons of cargo. The average growth rate from 1980 until the present is 4.3 percent per&#13;
year. With the project, long-term traffic (2000-2020) is forecast to increase at 3.4 percent per&#13;
year. Without expansion of Hengyang Port under the project, the port would receive more goods&#13;
(from other local small ports further upstream) than shipping out by the ratio of 2 to 1. In 1993,&#13;
the port handled 1.64 million tons. With the project, the increase of shipping capacity would&#13;
change the ratio, for the long term, to about 1 to 1.5. The shipping of local salt to downstream&#13;
cities through the Dayuandu shiplock would benefit most from the proposed development. It is&#13;
estimated that salt traffic would constitute about one third of cargo handled by the port. In 1993,&#13;
Zhuzhou Port, also to be expanded, handled about 2.19 million tons and about 80 percent of this&#13;
traffic consisted of a single item (construction materials). With the project, coal, salt and&#13;
construction materials would constitute about 80 percent of port traffic. The actual and forecast&#13;
traffic growth for these two ports are not very different from Dayuandu's. For details, see&#13;
Annex G.&#13;
4.5   Guangxi. The basic traffic pattern of the Xijiang River is one-way cargo transport. In&#13;
1993, downstream cargo constituted over 80 percent (1.34 million tons) of total river traffic (1.66&#13;
million tons). The main purpose of developing the river is to transport the outputs (coal and&#13;
phosphate) of rich mining provinces in southwest China (Yunnan and Guizhou) to the southern&#13;
coastal province of Guangdong. In Guangdong, annual growth in GOVAI has averaged nearly&#13;
20 percent a year since 1980, and a severe shortage of energy and raw materials has been the&#13;
norm. With the project, a large volume of coal and phosphate would be transported downstreamn.&#13;
It is estimated that river traffic will increase to 7.5 million tons in 2000 and 24.7 million tons in&#13;
2020.&#13;
C. COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
4.6   Operational Parameters. All operational parameters used in the economic analysis of&#13;
the project are discussed in Annex G. These were provided by the provincial Departments of&#13;
Communications and Transport and were acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
4.7   Project Costs. For the economic evaluation, all costs needed to complete the facilities&#13;
under the project were included, and inputs and outputs were evaluated in constant 1994&#13;
economic costs. Financial costs were converted to economic costs by shadow pricing each&#13;
component's input categories.  Conversion factors for each input category were based on&#13;
estimates determined in completed Bank studies. All price contingencies, taxes, duties and&#13;
interest payments were excluded. For traded goods, c.i.f. prices of imports and f.o.b. prices of&#13;
exports were used to estimate the cost of materials and equipment, with adjustments for the cost&#13;
of inland transport. The official exchange rate in November 1994 was used to convert foreign&#13;
costs to Yuan, adjusting for a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.0.&#13;
4.8   The overall conversion factor is 0.91 for Hunan, 0.92 for Guangxi and 0.88 for Zhejiang.&#13;
Detailed calculations for each project component are shown in Tables A2.4-2.9 of Annex G.&#13;
Factors derived for the various cost items were applied to the annual project expenditures to&#13;
obtain the stream of economic costs.&#13;
4.9   Project Benefits: Shiplocks and Channels. The economic analysis consists of two&#13;
steps: (a) identifying altemate solutions to meet the projected traffic demand and selecting the&#13;
most cost-effective solution; and (b) comparing the most cost-effective solution against the&#13;
alternative of doing nothing. Based on the analysis, the most cost-effective solution is to build the&#13;
two shiplocks and improve the four channels: (a) the project provides a more direct route for the&#13;
traffic and benefits from investments made in phase I construction on the Xiangjiang River&#13;
(Hunan) and Xijiang River (Guangxi), and (b) for four channels in Zhejiang, it provides the&#13;
cheapest way to transport low-valued dry-bulk cargo.  The next best alternative involves&#13;
constructing new shiplocks or improving channels elsewhere. Either would require much greater&#13;
capital expenditure to cover the phase I construction and a more indirect route with higher&#13;
operating costs for most of the traffic.&#13;
4.10  The above solution was then compared against the "do nothing" option. This would mean&#13;
continued underutilization of the rivers, worsening congestion in the existing channel and spillover&#13;
(of traffic) to the more expensive highway mode, if rivers or channels were not available.&#13;
4.11   Simple queuing modeling was used to simulate the chain of events to quantify the&#13;
magnitude of benefits. This consists of:&#13;
(a)    Obtaining unit transport cost-savings by shipping larger amounts;&#13;
(b)   Reducing travel distances for waterborne traffic;&#13;
(c)   Eliminating the need to use the higher-cost highway mode; and&#13;
(d)   Saving on operating costs due to the faster travel times.&#13;
4.12  The unit transport costs for various size vessels, used to estimate the benefits of the&#13;
proposed shiplocks and channels, are summarized below:&#13;

4.13   Power Stations. In appraising power projects, it is customary to value the project output&#13;
on the basis of the consumer's minimum willingness to pay, as evidenced by existing or&#13;
covenanted power tariff levels. However, this approximation generally underestimates the value&#13;
of electricity because, for many customers, power demand is rather inelastic to prices. This is&#13;
particularly the case in China, one manifestation of which is the economic cost of power rationing,&#13;
which is imposed daily to industries in Hunan and Guangxi, at an average level of over&#13;
100 fen/kWh. There are otherwise few power tariffs at the generating plant level to provide a&#13;
benchmark of this willingness to pay. The tariff levels projected under this project would result in&#13;
an internal economic rate of return (1ERR) of 18.3 percent.&#13;
4.14   Ports. The economic analysis primarily focuses on the benefits gained from relieving port&#13;
congestion: The project will yield quantifiable benefits in savings in cargo-handling costs, ship&#13;
time (both waiting and operating time), and cargo time. Details are in Annex G.&#13;
4.15   Only major benefits are included in the economic evaluation. There will be much more&#13;
unquantifiable benefits as discussed in Annex G (para. 29). Large benefits will accrue from&#13;
reducing environmental pollution, due to (a) improved handling of bulk cargo such as coal, salt,&#13;
sand and stone; (b) navigational aids for the rivers and channels; and (c) hydroelectric power&#13;
generation to avoid coal burning.&#13;
D. OVERALL ECONOMIC EVALUATION AND SENSITWITY ANALYSIS&#13;
4.16   The economic rate of return (ERR), net present value (NPV) and sensitivity calculations&#13;
for the entire project are summarized as follows (details are in Annex G). Sensitivity analysis&#13;
shows that even for large variations in the major parameters, which are unlikely in the Chinese context&#13;
(because project planning is conservative), the ERRs would be very satisfactory.&#13;

Project Risks&#13;
4.17  Most of the components under the project show very robust economic returns. The&#13;
investment in facilities for Hunan and Guangxi is not likely to be affected by any foreseeable&#13;
factor. The returns have a high degree of certainty because large investments were made during&#13;
Phase I construction. The ERRs for Zhejiang are subject to a low degree of uncertainty due to:&#13;
(a) the severe traffic bottlenecks in the waterway networks, and (b) the growing demand for&#13;
construction materials expected in the greater Shanghai metropolitan area and growing demand&#13;
for coal in Zhejiang Province.&#13;
4.18  The only remaining risks with respect to the project's physical elements are: (a) the&#13;
possibility that implementation will be substantially delayed and (b) funds from local governments&#13;
may be slower coming than planned.  However, TA  and institutional training during&#13;
implementation that could minimize such delays have been accepted by the executing agencies,&#13;
the budget for these items has been provided, and provincial governments have formally ensured&#13;
sufficient funds for the project. Given the degree of commitment at all levels to carry out the&#13;
project, the risk of failure is not considered serious.&#13;

5. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND FORECAST&#13;
A. INRODUCTION&#13;
5.1   China is accelerating its economic and financial reforms. MOF has introduced accounting&#13;
reforms, has issued revised accounting standards and general provisions since July 1, 1993, and is&#13;
making serious efforts to link the Chinese system with intemational financial practices. Also, the&#13;
country is inviting foreign investment and joint-venture operations. Market-oriented commercial&#13;
practices are replacing the old planned economic system.&#13;
5.2   Under the project, autonomous entities either have been or will be established, with much&#13;
greater freedom and responsibility. The entities are being authorized to conduct daily activities&#13;
relating to employment, operations and tariff reforms. This will give them incentives to manage&#13;
their operations in the most efficient manner and also take full responsibility for their efforts.&#13;
Moreover, the process should help them  promote higher productivity and financial self-&#13;
sufficiency. The Bank has been instrumental in encouraging Chinese authorities to adopt&#13;
commercial practices and business principles, and implement institutional and sectoral reforms&#13;
that involve deregulation, modem technology, investment planning and pricing policy.&#13;
5.3   However, as these actions are in the early stages, tariff levels are not yet cost-oriented;&#13;
rather, they are determined on the basis of arbitrary cost allocations to each major activity. Under&#13;
the project, a full IWW costing system will be established to ensure that tariffs reflect the costs of&#13;
efficient operations. Local authorities will attempt to remove price distortions and prepare action&#13;
plans to introduce new cost-based tariffs.&#13;
B. PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE IWW IN THE PROVINCES&#13;
5.4   Since the three provinces are not linked and operate their IWW  independently, the&#13;
financial evaluations were also carried out individually.  The waterways' past financial&#13;
performance in Zhejiang, Hunan and Guangxi for 1989-93 is summarized below.&#13;

currently in operation. The proposed project will add two new river ports at Jiaxing and&#13;
Huzhou ports and an additional facility in the Hangzhou port.&#13;

in operation. The proposed project will add the shiplock and power plant facilities and the&#13;
upgrading of the Hengyang and Zhuzhou ports.&#13;
/c The above figures are for the channel operations only. The proposed project will add the&#13;
shiplock and power plant facilities.&#13;
5.5   The evaluation of the IWW past financial performance revealed no systematic or adequate&#13;
tariff system that would ensure financial viability. From 1989 to 1992, operating ratios showed&#13;
deteriorating trends for Zhejiang and Hunan operations and poor performance from the beginning&#13;
for Guangxi. In the latter, revenues did not cover operating costs and revenue increases lagged&#13;
behind those of costs. For all three, the sole source of income for channel operations was the&#13;
channel maintenance fee. Only Zhejiang started collecting the IWW construction fee in 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
Until recently, the provincial governments have subsidized the channel operations, which provided&#13;
no incentive to the IWW to improve operational and financial performance. Returns on net fixed&#13;
assets were negative for Guangxi, very low for Hunan and from good to just acceptable for&#13;
Zhejiang. Financial performance was poor for channel operations and better for river operations,&#13;
but still needed to be improved. Debt/equity ratios indicated very low or no long-term loans.&#13;
Provincial governments have been the main source of funds, mainly for investments-although&#13;
Guangxi and Hunan also received operating subsidies. Zhejiang's river port operations were self-&#13;
sufficient and received no governmental assistance. However, its channel operations did not have&#13;
sufficient funds for maintenance and upkeep until 1993, when another revenue source, the&#13;
waterway construction fee, was introduced.&#13;
5.6   Thus, tariffs will need to be reformed to ensure full cost recovery and profitability. Tariff&#13;
structures and levels should represent the cost of efficient operations, calculated with a sound&#13;
costing system. Costs and revenues should be analyzed by major activity or profit center so that&#13;
each operating unit is responsible for its profitability. Attempts should also be made to improve&#13;
productivity and reduce costs. This will ensure that Government subsidies will be unnecessary.&#13;
Further, the financial accounting system still needs to be improved to bring it in line with modem&#13;
international accounting standards: At present, no internal or external audits are made of the&#13;
waterways' financial affairs and the accuracy of financial data is not certified. At negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached with the Borrower that project accounts, including SEs and Special&#13;
Accounts for each provinice, will be audited by firms acceptable to the Bank and reports will be&#13;
furnished to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year. A separate opinion on&#13;
SEs will also be included in the audit report. Also, agreement was reached that Zhejiang,&#13;
Guangxi and HX:NCDC will have the financial statements (income statement, cash flow&#13;
statements an7d balanice sheets) of IWW operations included in the project audited by firms&#13;
acceptable to the Bank and their reports will be funmished to the Bank within six months of the&#13;
end of each fiscal year. The audit reports will contain separate sections as follows: (a) for&#13;
Zhejiang, the channels managed by PAO and each channel port at Hangzhou, Jiaxing and&#13;
Huzhou; (b) for Hunan, the channel and shiplock, the power plant and each channel port at&#13;
Zhuzhou and Hengyang-all operated by HXNCDC; and (c) for Guangxi, the channel and&#13;
shiplock, and the power plant managed by XJPH.&#13;
C. FINANCIAL FORECAST UNDER REFORMED STRUCTURE&#13;
5.7   The IWW financial reform action plan (paras. 2.13-2.18) includes: (a) establishment of&#13;
new financial management and accounting models conforming to a market economy; (b) creation&#13;
of modern management and responsibility accounting; and (c) enhancement of the role of financial&#13;
management in the corporate structure. Authorities are focusing on generating sufficient cash to&#13;
cover their financial obligations.  Each major operation (channels, dams and shiplocks,&#13;
hydropower plants and river ports) will be designated as separate profit and responsibility&#13;
accounting centers. The power plants will be managed independently within the overall IWW&#13;
framework and will play a key economic role in Hunan and Guangxi. Since they will use the dam&#13;
facilities, including differential heads formed at the dams, they will share the operating costs of&#13;
dam operations. These costs will be allocated based on a benefit analysis. The combined&#13;
waterways and power plant operations will help with cost recovery. Based on such premises,&#13;
each province prepared a financial forecast for the 1995-2008 period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
5.8      Detailed  assumptions for the financial forecast are recorded  in the Project File.  Major&#13;
assumptions are as follows:&#13;
(a)      an  investment plan  of $556.8  million  including  $210.0  million  for the  foreign&#13;
component, for the implementation period of 1995 to 2000;&#13;
(b)      the traffic forecast for the waterways, tonnage to be handled at the channel ports&#13;
and electricity sales forecast for the proposed power plants in Guangxi and Hunan&#13;
have been used for the revenues and operating cost calculations;&#13;
(c)      annual cost increases based  on  estimated  annual inflation  rates were applied to&#13;
operating costs. The periodic adjustments were made to tariffs for waterways,&#13;
ports and electricity to ensure full cost recovery and the achievement of financial&#13;
viability. New tariffs were also introduced for the construction of channels and&#13;
shiplock operations;&#13;
(d)      the  Bank  loan  of $210.0  million  was allocated  to  three  provinces with  $90.0&#13;
million to Guangxi, $80.0 million to Hunan and $40.0 million to Zhejiang. The&#13;
terms of the loan were the same as the Bank loan; and&#13;
(e)      income tax  is levied  on  power plant profits and the channel port operations at&#13;
33 percent.&#13;

The above figures assume that the three provinces have taken bold steps to arrest the deterioration in&#13;
financial performance. During the period projected, their major financial burden will be to meet high&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
debt service obligation caused by heavy but necessary investments. Although capital expenditure and&#13;
interest during construction will be provided by the central, provincial and municipal governments,&#13;
payments on the World Bank loan and some local bank loans will still heavily tax their financial&#13;
resources. Thus, the plan calls for periodic tariff hikes during the forecast period for channel&#13;
operations and river ports. New tariffs are also expected to be set for the shiplock and power plant at&#13;
levels that will ensure sufficient funds to cover all financial obligations and achieve the long-term&#13;
objectives of (a) operating under commercial principles; (b) improving productivity and reducing costs;&#13;
and (c) achieving and sustaining financial self-sufficiency. Top officials of the provincial governments&#13;
have confirned that waterways will be allowed to increase tariffs to generate enough revenues to cover&#13;
all financial obligations and become financially viable.&#13;
5.10  With the reforms envisioned, the operating ratios for Zhejiang will rise from 62 percent in&#13;
1996 to 70 percent in 2000 and then gradually improve to 59 percent in 2008; for Hunan, they&#13;
will improve from 82 percent in 1996 to 50 percent in 2008; and for Guangxi, they will improve&#13;
from 63 percent in 1996 to 48 percent in 2008. The return on net fixed assets will also improve&#13;
gradually in all three provinces.&#13;
5.11  With government grants during implementation and with regular tariff increases as&#13;
assumed in the forecast, the IWW will be able to accumulate enough surplus to replace fixed&#13;
assets at the end of their lives. Total cash obligations during implementation will be adequately&#13;
covered by each province through internal cash generation, long-term loans and government&#13;
contributions. Since Guangxi is poor and badly needs economic development, the provincial&#13;
government has exempted the shiplock operations from taxes on profits, at least during the&#13;
forecast period. This will help the Guangxi IWW to substantially strengthen its financial&#13;
condition.&#13;
5.12  The debt/equity ratios for each province are expected to improve as follows:&#13;
2000     2004      2008&#13;
Zhejiang               53/47    35/65      14/86&#13;
Hunan                  35/65     24/76     13/87&#13;
Guangxi                26/74     14/86      7/93&#13;
Current and quick ratios also remain good. Fixed assets were not revalued in the forecast, since&#13;
most will be acquired through the project and will represent current costs. Future revaluation is a&#13;
policy matter for which high-level discussions are required.&#13;
5.13  Also, consolidated financial statements for all three provinces were produced to review&#13;
overall project performance. These results were also very satisfactory:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2000      2004      2008&#13;
Operating ratios (%)                 53         56        52&#13;

Debt/equity ratio                  33/67     20/80     10/90&#13;
5.14   The project is highly sensitive to tariff adjustments. A sensitivity analysis was carried out&#13;
to examine the impact of reduced revenues. If the channel maintenance and construction fees,&#13;
electricity rates for the hydropower plant, shiplock tolls and river port tariffs are reduced, causing&#13;
revenues to decline by 25 percent, the consolidated operating ratios for the three provinces will&#13;
deteriorate as follows:&#13;
Operating Ratio:          1996   1998   2000  2002  2004   2006    2008&#13;
Base Forecast              68%    64%    54%   54%   56%    54%         52%&#13;
Following 25% reduction    90%    86%    72%   72%   73%    73%         69%&#13;
in revenues&#13;
The above figures reveal that if the revenues are reduced by 25 percent, the adverse impact will be&#13;
substantial: Net cash flow will be negative in the seven years of the forecast period, IWW will not be&#13;
able to service their debt fully nor generate sufficient funds for future investments, and provincial&#13;
governments may have to continue to subsidizing these gaps. Thus, tariff increases in the forecast play&#13;
a major role in improving finances.&#13;
5.15   Projections for the waterways show good profits due to substantial tariff hikes and to&#13;
Government contributions (at the beginning) to their investments, which will need to be adequate&#13;
and timely. Also, authorities will need to give full support to the tariff hikes.&#13;
5.16   Since the project involves the first-time construction of dams, shiplocks, ports and power&#13;
plants, the implementing agencies will not need additional funds for a long period (at least not&#13;
until the last financial forecast year of 2008). Therefore, neither the self-financing ratio nor rate of&#13;
return on net fixed assets indicator is meaningful. Instead, it is important to ensure that IWW&#13;
operations are run efficiently and adequate revenues are produced to meet all financial obligations,&#13;
including heavy debt service. The appropriate financial targets for these purposes are the debt&#13;
service coverage ratio and operating ratio, both are good indicators of financial viability and&#13;
simple to understand for the project agencies.&#13;
5.17  In addition, for the power plant, another indicator-the financial internal rate of return&#13;
(FIRR)-would also be used to ensure satisfactory performance and adequate cash generation.&#13;
The FIRR has become the standard financial indicator in China's already well-developed power&#13;
sector and should be used for the proposed project to ensure adequate pricing levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
5.18  Use of the FIRR would be consistent with Bank practice in its other power projects,&#13;
which, over 15 years, have helped to introduce significant commercialization of operations&#13;
throughout the sector. In contrast, institutions in the IWW subsector are at an earlier stage of&#13;
commercialization and need further development in this area. The proposed project consequently&#13;
includes technical assistance and training to improve staff capabilities in financial management.&#13;
Such institutional strengthening will facilitate use of the FIRR for IWW investments in the future.&#13;
5.19 Considering the above, agreement was reached during negotiations that:&#13;
(a)   Zhejiang and Guangxi and Hunan/HXNCDC would:&#13;
(i)   not incur additional debt on IWW operations, including power plants,&#13;
unless a reasonable forecast shows that the funds generated wouldprovide&#13;
the debt service coverage ratios: for Guangxi, of not less than 2.0 times&#13;
from the year 2000; for HXNCDC, of not less than 1.2 times between 2000&#13;
and 2002 and 1.5 times thereafter; andfor Zhejiang, of not less than 1.0&#13;
times between 1999 and 2001, 1.1 times between 2002 and 2003 and 1.5&#13;
times thereafter; and&#13;
(ii)   take all necessary measures, including but not limited to tariff&#13;
adjustments, to ensure that they would achieve the operating ratios of not&#13;
more than 75 percent at all times from 1996 for Zhejiang and Guangxi,&#13;
and 85 percent between 1996 and 1999 and 75 percent thereafter for&#13;
HXNCDC.&#13;
(b)   HXNCDC will enter into a power sales agreement with Hunan, represented by the&#13;
Hunan Electricity Supply Board, before March 1, 1998, acceptable to the Bank,&#13;
which establishes:&#13;
(i)   the procedure for initially setting, and periodically adjusting, the average&#13;
tariff for electricity supplied by the project, to achieve a projected real&#13;
financial rate of return (FIRR) of no less than 10 percent on the&#13;
proportion of the project capital and operating costs allocated to power;&#13;
(ii)   the principles for determining the tariff structure, that is, the portions of&#13;
the average tariffs determined from capacity charges and electricity&#13;
charges (variable depending on the season and the time of day), to ensure&#13;
efficient supply of power from the project power plants and reduced&#13;
financial risks of constrained supply due to low-flow hydrological&#13;
conditions; and&#13;
(iii)   the relative responsibilities of the Seller, HXNCDC, and the Buyer, Hunan&#13;
Electricity Supply Board, in operating the power plant and the reservoir,&#13;
and in dispatching the electricity procured, to maximize benefits&#13;
generated by the project with specified constraints.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
(c)   Guangxi would ensure that the electricity prices charged by the company to be&#13;
established in 2000 will allow a financial internal rate of return of 10percent on energy&#13;
provided by the project dam.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;

HYDROPOWER GENERATION&#13;
A. HUNAN PROVINCE&#13;
General&#13;
1.    The navigation dam is an important part of the upgrading to Class III (1,000 dwt&#13;
vessels) in Hunan waterways. The first phase was finished in 1993. The present dam&#13;
construction includes a shiplock and a power generating plant.  Techno/economic&#13;
particulars are shown in Table 1.&#13;
Hydrological, Geological and Meteorological Design Data&#13;
2.    It was designed by Hunan Design Institute for Communications Planning and&#13;
Survey. The meteorological design data have been collected from figures of rainfall over&#13;
the last 30 years. The geological data from the soil investigation have been incorporated&#13;
in the design of the foundation of the dam and auxiliary works. The hydrological figures&#13;
for water levels and flows from several stations have been used in the apparent river&#13;
section. All these data result in an upstream normal-storage water level at Dayuanda dam&#13;
of 50 m above Yellow Sea level. The maximum head of the dam has been set at 11.24 m&#13;
(flood season) and minimum head 3.01 m (in dry season). Average season flow has been&#13;
estimated to be 1,440 m3/s and the design head of the power plant for selection of the&#13;
generators is 7.5 m.&#13;
Hydropower Station&#13;
3.    The Dayuanda hydropower station has been selected as an optimum location in&#13;
this part of the river. The impact of the energy loss of the upstream hydropower station of&#13;
Baiyudan dam has been analyzed and taken into account. With the estimated storage level&#13;
of 50 m (above Yellow Sea level) water head, this part of the river has the most economic&#13;
power generation.  The average yearly generated energy has been calculated to be&#13;
483 GWh with an installed capacity of 120 MW.  The successive hydropower&#13;
development in Hunan Province gives a decrease in the power gap between demand and&#13;
generation of power (Table 2).&#13;
Selection of Generators&#13;
4.    The initially selected turbines are of the tubular Kaplan type. In this range of&#13;
capacity (estimated flow and water head), the Kaplan turbine is most economic with&#13;
efficiency of more than 90 percent at the rated operating point. The number of generators&#13;
and the installed capacity has been deduced via sensitivity analyses of different types and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-62-                       ANNEX A&#13;
manufacturers. The analysis shows an optimum in economic investment cost with the&#13;
120 MW option. Locally manufactured generators of the Kaplan type have a maximum&#13;
capacity of 15 MW. Imported generators of former Socialist countries had been selected,&#13;
being 5 x 24 MW = 120 MW.&#13;
5.    Now having the opportunity of the World Bank loan, larger sets may be imported&#13;
from abroad, resulting in the final selection of four sets each of 30 MW bulb turbines. The&#13;
selected type of generators each have the following main characteristics: diameter of&#13;
turbine impeller 7.5 m, design head 7.5 m, efficiency at rated operating point 92 percent,&#13;
rated flow 454 m3/s, annual generated power 556 GWh.&#13;
6.    By this selection the power generation increases with 4 percent, so more benefits&#13;
will result. Also foreign technology will give an impact on the technical and scientific&#13;
development of the knowledge in the HDPC department.&#13;
Implementation at the Dam Site&#13;
7.    The location of the powerhouse on the right bank in the outer curve of the river&#13;
gives better downstream flow. The high-voltage switchyard has been located beside the&#13;
right bank of the river, downstream of the dam.&#13;
8.    The outer size of the main building of the powerhouse including assembly area is&#13;
approximately 130 x 80 x 55 m. The surface area of the switchyard is approximately&#13;
130 x 35 m. The shiplock (with dimensions 180 x 23 m and gate-sill water depth 3 m) in&#13;
the inner curve of the river gives good navigational performance and sufficient waiting&#13;
area for the 1,000 dwt vessels.&#13;
Power Distribution Systems&#13;
9.    The outgoing voltage of 10.5 kV of the four generators will be transformed to&#13;
110 kV for the connection to the county grid. The two main transformers each have a&#13;
capacity of 75 MVA. A separate transformer supplying the site facilities of the generator&#13;
house, the shiplock, the dam racks and gates is part of the 10 kV system. A distribution&#13;
transformer in the power station supplies the normal fixtures and outlets of the lighting&#13;
and power consumers 220/380 V.&#13;
Transmission Lines&#13;
10.   To connect the power station with the county grid, high-voltage switchgears for&#13;
110 kV supply outgoing overhead transmission lines to other substations upstream and&#13;
downstream are proposed. Approximately 80 km transmission lines including safety&#13;
devices and switchgears are part of the project.&#13;
&#13;

B. GUANGXI ZHUANG AUTONOMOUS REGION&#13;
General&#13;
11.   The navigation dam is an important part of the upgrading to Class III (1,000 dwt&#13;
vessels) in Guangxi waterways. The first phase was finished in 1993. The first phase also&#13;
included dam/shiplock construction and power generation (3 x 15.5 MW) at Guiping,&#13;
downstream of Guigang. Techno/economic particulars are shown in Table 3.&#13;
Hydrological, Geological and Meteorological Design Data&#13;
12.  It was designed by Guangxi Electric Power Industry Supervising and Design&#13;
Institute. The meteorological design data collected from figures of rainfall over the last 30&#13;
years. The geological data from the soil investigation has been incorporated in the design&#13;
of the foundation of the dam and auxiliary works. The hydrological figures for water&#13;
levels and flows from several stations have been used in the apparent river section. All&#13;
these data result in an upstream normal-storage water level at Guigang dam of 43.10 m&#13;
above South China Sea level. The maximum head of the dam has been set up at 13.29 m&#13;
(flood season) and minimum head at 2.50 m (in dry season). Average season flow has&#13;
been estimated to be 1,613 m3/s and the design head of the power plant for selection of the&#13;
generators is 8.5 m.&#13;
Hydropower Station&#13;
13.   The Guigang hydropower station has been selected as an optimum location in this&#13;
part of the river. The impact on the energy loss of the upstream hydropower station of&#13;
Xijin dam has been analyzed and taken into account. With the estimated storage level of&#13;
43.10 m water head, this part of the river has the most economic power generation&#13;
potential. The average yearly generated energy has been calculated to be 600 GWhI, with&#13;
an installed capacity of 120 MW. The successive hydropower development in Guangxi&#13;
Autonomous Region gives a decrease in the power gap between demand and generation of&#13;
power (Table 4).&#13;
Selection of Generators&#13;
14.   The location of the powerhouse at the left bank in the outer curve of the river&#13;
gives better downstream flow. The high-voltage switchyard has been located beside the&#13;
left bank of the river downstream of the dam.&#13;
15.   The outer sizes of the main building of the powerhouse including assembly area are&#13;
approximately 130 x 80 x 55 m. The surface area of the switchyard is approximately&#13;
110 x 40 m. The shiplock (with dimensions 180 x 23 m and gate-sill water depth 3 m) in&#13;
the inner curve of the river gives good navigational performance and sufficient waiting&#13;
area for the 1,000 dwt vessels.&#13;

Power Distribution Systems&#13;
16.   The outgoing voltage of 10.5 kV of the four generators will be transformed to&#13;
110 kV for connection to the county grid. The two main transformers each have a&#13;
capacity of 75 MVA. One transformer partly supplies the local grid 35 kV. A separate&#13;
transformer supplying the site facilities of the generator house, the shiplock, the dam racks&#13;
and gates is part of the 10 kV system. A distribution transformer in the power station&#13;
supplies the normal fixtures and outlets of the lighting and power consumers 220/380 V.&#13;
Transmission Lines&#13;
17.   To connect the power station with the county grid, high-voltage switchgears for&#13;
110 kV supply outgoing overhead transmission lines to other substations upstream and&#13;
downstream are proposed. Approximately 60 km transmission lines including safety dives&#13;
and switchgears have been part of the project.&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND ACTION PLAN&#13;
SUMMARY&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Environmental assessments (EAs) were carried out for Zhejiang, Hunan and&#13;
Guangxi project components respectively. EAs for four channels and three ports under&#13;
the Zhejiang project component were carried out by the Zhejiang Environmental&#13;
Protection Institute and the Zhejiang Design Institute of Environmental Protection of&#13;
Light Industry and EA reports were completed by March 1993. Based on the findings of&#13;
the EAs and subsequent to the discussion with Bank staff, Environmental Action Plans&#13;
(EAPs) for seven subcomponents were prepared by the Zhejiang Provincial&#13;
Communications Department (ZPCD) in October 1993 and submitted to the Bank in&#13;
January 1994. An EA for the Hunan project component was carried out by the Hunan&#13;
University and completed in August 1993. Based on the findings of the EA reports, an&#13;
EAP was prepared by the Hunan Provincial Communications Department (HPCD) in&#13;
September 1993. These documents were submitted to the Bank in January 1994. An EA&#13;
for the Guangxi project component was carried out by the Guangxi Electric Industry&#13;
Design Institute in 1990-91. An EA report including supplementary information to meet&#13;
the Bank requirements, an EAP and an Environmental Monitoring Plan were prepared in&#13;
English by the Environomics and submnitted to the Bank in February 1994. EA Summaries&#13;
of Zhejiang, Hunan and Guangxi project components were prepared respectively and&#13;
submitted to the Bank in May 1994. The EAs, EA Summaries and EAPs were discussed&#13;
and revised during the appraisal mission in November/December 1994. The final EA&#13;
Summaries and EAPs were submitted to the Bank in January 1995 and found to be&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
2.    A number of potential impacts were identified in the EA process. Regarding&#13;
channel upgrading in Zhejiang, potential environmental problems include (i) land&#13;
acquisition for channel widening, (ii) impacts of dredging, (iii) impacts of water pollution&#13;
on the existing water use, (iv) ship wastes and noise by vessels.  Regarding port&#13;
improvements in Zhejiang and Hunan, potential problems include (i) wastewater and solid&#13;
wastes from ship and port activities, (ii) impacts on drinking water intake, (iii) wastewater&#13;
and dust from coalyards, (iv) noise and air pollution including those due to increased land&#13;
traffic. Regarding dam construction in Hunan and Guangxi, potential problems include&#13;
(a) impacts of inundation on ecological setting and cultural relics, (b) impacts on water&#13;
quality in reservoir areas and downstream, (c) impacts on fish and fish migration,&#13;
(d) impacts of hydrological changes. Regarding waterways regulation and shoal removal&#13;
in Hunan and Guangxi, potential problems include impacts of blasting and turbidity by&#13;
shoal removal on fish and aquatic culture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.    A number of mitigation measures in the design, construction and operation phases&#13;
were identified and integrated in the EAPs to address the above problems. The potential&#13;
impacts and their mitigation measures are highlighted in the later chapters and summarized&#13;
in the Appendix 1 of this Annex. It was ascertained that the proposed project would not&#13;
affect ecologically sensitive areas and if appropriate measures are taken, the construction&#13;
and operation should have no significant adverse environmental impact.&#13;
4.    The EAPs specified the measures, monitoring and institutional arrangements&#13;
required to mitigate the potential adverse effects on the environment during the&#13;
construction and operation of the project.&#13;
5.    The process of environmental review involved inputs from various units in the&#13;
region, including those from provincial and local environmental protection bureaus&#13;
(EPBs), research institutions and universities. The affected groups, and the people subject&#13;
to resettlement and land acquisition in particular, have been intensively consulted. The&#13;
three provincial governments made it known to the public that EIA documents are placed&#13;
in their offices where they are available to all interested parties for review.&#13;
6.    The policy and administrative requirements for environmental assessment of&#13;
development projects in China were followed during preparation and evaluation of the&#13;
EA, as well as the Bank's OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. Major laws and&#13;
regulations applied to the EA for the project include:&#13;
(a)   Environmental Protection Law of China;&#13;
(b)   Water Pollution Prevention Law of China;&#13;
(c)   Environmental Protection Administration Law for Traffic Projects;&#13;
(d)   Managerial Measures for Environmental Protection in Capital Construction&#13;

B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF ZHEJIANG PROJECT COMPONENT&#13;
Major Project Components&#13;
8.    The channel system  of northern Zhejiang Province provides an important&#13;
transportation linkage between major centers in the south of China and Shanghai, and also&#13;
provides means of transporting raw materials and goods from Zhejiang to Shanghai. The&#13;
proposed improvements are part of a long-range program to upgrade the inland&#13;
waterways to Navigational Waterway Class V (300 dwt), thus shifting some of the bulk&#13;
cargo traffic from highways and railways.&#13;
9.    The major project components in Zhejiang will include the improvement of four&#13;
channels by widening/deepening: (i) Hangzhou-Beijing Grand Canal, (ii) Changxing-&#13;
Huzhou-Shanghai Channel, (iii) Hangzhou-Shanghai Channel, and (iv) Zhapu-Jiaxing-&#13;
Suzhou Channel. It will also include the construction of terminals in the Hangzhou,&#13;
Huzhou and Jiaxing Ports.&#13;
Baseline Environmental Description&#13;
10.   Geography.  The project is located in the northeastem  section of Zhejiang&#13;
Province. The land mass is relatively flat with general drainage from the north to the&#13;
southeast through mostly agricultural lands. The channels were built in many hundreds&#13;
years ago and have been widened, deepened and upgraded over the centuries to&#13;
accommodate larger vessels and increased traffic between the major commercial centers of&#13;
Guangzhou to the south and Shanghai to the north.&#13;
11.   Hydrological and Meteorological Conditions.  The region belongs to a&#13;
subtropical monsoon climatic zone, having moist temperature, demarcated seasons and&#13;
abundant rainfall with the average annual temperature of 15.7°C, average humidity of&#13;
80 percent and annual precipitation of about 1,200 mm. Occasional typhoons strike in the&#13;
early Summer and Autumn periods resulting in considerable flooding. The surface&#13;
drainage goes into the river/waterway network and finally into the Qiantang River and&#13;
Hangzhou Bay. The river/waterway network is a well developed water transportation&#13;
network.&#13;
12.   Population and Economy. The Hangzhou-Huzhou-Jiaxing triangle is the most&#13;
developed section of Zhejiang Province. In addition to excellent agricultural land, the area&#13;
is a major silk producer and supplies large quantities of construction materials to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -                      ANNEX E&#13;
Shanghai. In addition, there are numerous villages/towns, particularly along the channels,&#13;
reflecting their historical importance in the provincial transportation network.&#13;
13.   Noise and Air Quality. The proposed channel sections mainly pass through rural&#13;
and small village areas and may increase local noise levels through vessel engines and&#13;
horns. In the larger urban centers, particularly Hangzhou and Jiaxing, there have been&#13;
numerous complaints related to vessel horns and engine noise at night. The air quality&#13;
ranges from excellent in rural area to fair in urban area. Air quality degradation can be&#13;
attributed to the handling and combustion of coal (heating and electricity generation)&#13;
followed by vehicle and shipping exhaust.&#13;
14.   Water Quality and Sediment. Water quality is poor in many sections of the&#13;
inland waterways (typically National Water Quality Standards Class 4 or 5) due to the&#13;
channels being used as receiving water for untreated or minimally treated industrial and&#13;
sanitary sewage and stormwater discharges. The pollution level of the various waterway&#13;
sections was classified into four categories: not polluted, slightly, moderately and heavily&#13;
polluted, based on trace metals concentrations in the sediments. As with water quality, the&#13;
contamination of sediments was mainly attributed to accumulation of pollutants through&#13;
various urban and industrial discharges.&#13;
Potential Impacts and their Mitigation Measures&#13;
15.   Alternatives. Existing channel alignment was used as much as possible. For&#13;
sections that need widening, channels will be widened on one side with less land&#13;
acquisition and relocation of houses. Sites for port terminals were also selected, taking&#13;
into account of minimizing land acquisition, relocation of houses and adverse&#13;
environmental impacts. Layout of the port facilities were designed to minimize the&#13;
adverse impacts on surrounding residential areas.&#13;
16.   Water Pollution Control. Excavation of materials for channel widening and&#13;
deepening will be undertaken in two phases. In phase 1, new channel retaining walls are&#13;
constructed and the material is excavated in the dry condition. This clean soil is utilized to&#13;
backfill the retaining walls and to in-fill various areas designated for land improvement. In&#13;
phase 2, the old canal walls and underlying sediments are removed by dredging. Based on&#13;
the previous studies, the sediments in the dredging sections have been classified as not-&#13;
polluted or slightly-polluted. The polluted sediments will be disposed of in the approved&#13;
disposal sites and will be covered with clean soil. Disposal plans will be reviewed and&#13;
approved by the local EPBs.&#13;
17.   While no intakes for drinking water, irrigation or fish breeding are located along&#13;
the channel sections, water is diverted from side tributaries to serve fish breeding and&#13;
irrigation. In order to prevent any pollution problems through tributaries, temporary&#13;
coffer dams will be constructed where appropriate and intensive water quality monitoring&#13;
will be undertaken during the dredging activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -                      ANNEX E&#13;
18.   Comprehensive water pollution control plans have been drafted by relevant&#13;
municipal governments (Hangzhou, Jiaxing and Huzhou) in order to improve water quality&#13;
in urban areas, and now under review of the provincial authorities. In support of these&#13;
plans, Zhejiang Provincial Communications Department (ZPCD) will take various&#13;
measures such as (i) strict enforcement of regulations to prevent disposal of oily water and&#13;
other ship wastes from vessels, (ii) construction of treatment facilities for oily water and&#13;
sanitary sewage from shipping and port facilities, (iii) collection and disposal of solid&#13;
wastes from shipping and port activities, (iv) prevention of accidental spill of hazardous&#13;
substances from vessels through a prior approval system and an emergency response plan.&#13;
19.   Noise. During the construction phase, heavy machineries with significant noise&#13;
will be restricted to daytime. During the operation phase, ZPCD will strictly enforce noise&#13;
related regulations for vessels, in particular, the use of horns at night. The conversion to&#13;
larger and newer vessels will result in noise reduction through less noisy engines and&#13;
better mufflers. In port areas, measures such as noise barriers and greenbelts will be taken&#13;
as appropriate to comply with the ambient noise standards.&#13;
20.   Air Pollution.  During the construction phase, water will be sprayed as&#13;
appropriate to control dust. During operation of the port facilities, rigorous dust control&#13;
measures will be implemented, particularly for the control of coal dust, both during&#13;
storage and loading/unloading.  Dust will be controlled through enclosure walls,&#13;
greenbelts and the use of water sprays. All sprayed water will be collected and treated to&#13;
meet current Chinese effluent guidelines before discharge to the waterways. ZPCD will&#13;
strictly enforce regulations to reduce air pollution attributed to vessel exhaust.&#13;
Environmental Monitoring&#13;
21.   At present, the Zhejiang Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau (ZPEPB)&#13;
and the local EPBs (Hangzhou, Jiaxing and Huzhou) are carrying out extensive&#13;
monitoring programs for air, noise and water quality throughout the project area. In&#13;
coordination and cooperation with them, ZPCD will undertake an extensive environmental&#13;
monitoring program during the construction and operation phases.&#13;
22.   Air Pollution. During port construction, total suspended particulate (TSP), SO2,&#13;
NOx and dust will be monitored once per week at four sites in each of the three ports.&#13;
During the operation phase, they will be monitored once per month at the same sites of the&#13;
ports.&#13;
23.   Water Pollution. Present routine water quality monitoring includes 15 sites along&#13;
the Hangzhou-Beijing Grand Canal, 19 sites along the Hangzhou-Shanghai Channel,&#13;
10 sites along the Changxing-Huzhou-Shanghai Channel and 15 sites along the Zhapu-&#13;
Jiaxing-Suzhou Channel three times per year. In addition to this, water quality will be&#13;
monitored once a month at the nearest downstream monitoring transect during the&#13;
construction of a particular section. BOD and suspended solids (SS) will be monitored in&#13;
a more intensive manner during construction activities.  Monitoring during port&#13;
construction will be similar to that for channels. During the operation phase, in addition to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -                     ANNEX E&#13;
the routine monitoring, BOD, COD and SS will be monitored at discharge exits of&#13;
terminals.&#13;
24.   Noise. During construction of the channels, noise will be monitored one day per&#13;
week. At the port areas, noise monitoring will be undertaken in the same manner as air&#13;
pollution monitoring. During the operation, noise will be monitored at the same sites as&#13;
for water quality twice per year and once per month at four sites in each of the three ports.&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
25.   To implement the project, ZPCD has set up the Zhejiang Inland Waterway&#13;
Network Reconstruction Project Administration Office (PAO). Within the PAO will be an&#13;
Environmental Protection Division (EPD: 2-3 environmental staff), three Environmental&#13;
Protection Sections (EPSs: 1-2 environmental staff respectively) within each of the three&#13;
project construction offices (Hangzhou, Huzhou and Jiaxing), and three Environmental&#13;
Monitoring Centers (EMCs: 6-8 staff) at the three ports. The EPD and the three EPSs&#13;
will be established before negotiations and the EMCs before construction of the ports. All&#13;
other monitoring will be undertaken under contract to the municipal EPBs.&#13;
26.   The EPD and EPSs have the responsibility for preparing appropriate documents&#13;
under the World Bank loan, undertaking environmental supervision of the construction&#13;
activities, implementing appropriate mitigative measures, coordinating and managing the&#13;
environmental protection during the construction and operational phases of the project.&#13;
27.   ZPEPB and local EPBs have the responsibility for environmental management and&#13;
supervision within their jurisdictions, including coordination and general supervision on&#13;
the environmental aspects of the project.&#13;
28.   While the Provincial and Municipal EPBs are adequately staffed and equipped to&#13;
undertake the monitoring and supervision related to this project, the PAO staff will require&#13;
additional training, particularly in the management of mitigation measures and monitoring&#13;
programs. A budget of Y 32,000 and $48,000 has been allocated for environmental&#13;
training, which enables 8 person-months of training in China and 6 person-months abroad&#13;
in 1996.&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF HUNAN PROJECT COMPONENT&#13;
Major Project Components&#13;
29.   The purpose of the Hunan Xiangjiang Navigational Project is to upgrade the&#13;
navigability of 439 km of the Xiangjiang River from Chenglingji (on the Changjiang River)&#13;
to Hengyang to accommodate 1,000 dwt vessels (National Waterway Class 3), thus&#13;
providing improved commercial transportation from Hengyang in the center of Hunan&#13;
Province to coastal ports, such as Shanghai. The upgrading of the navigation channel by&#13;
dredging and river regulation between Chenglingji and Zhuzhou was completed in late&#13;
1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-85 -                      ANNEX E&#13;
30.   The major project components in Hunan will include (i) construction of a dan/&#13;
shiplock and 120 MW hydropower station at Dayuandu, (ii) upgrading of port facilities at&#13;
Hengyang and Zhuzhou Ports, and (iii) shoal removal (23 sites) and river training works&#13;
between Zhuzhou and Dayuandu. A major economic benefit will be the generation of&#13;
power that will off-set costs related to construction and operation of the navigation&#13;
facilities.&#13;
Baseline Environmental Description&#13;
31.   Geography. The Xiangjiang Basin occupies about half of the total area of Hunan&#13;
Province, with the river serving as a major commercial linkage between cities/mdustrial&#13;
centers along the river and via the Changliang River, other major urbanrindustrial centers&#13;
throughout eastern China. The darn is proposed to be located at the Jiuliangdeng&#13;
shallows, where the surrounding lands are relatively hilly. The river width ranges from&#13;
450 m in dry seasons to about 600 m in wet seasons.&#13;
32.   Population and Economy. The Xiangjiang Basin contains five major urban/&#13;
industrial centers in Hunan Province: Hengyang, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, Changsha and&#13;
Yueyang. The river provides an important commercial linkage between these cities.&#13;
Outside of these centers, the population along the project area is predominately&#13;
agricultural in employment and over 95 percent of the I million people in the affected area&#13;
by the headpond is listed as agricultural workers.&#13;
33.   Ecological Environment. The project-affected areas are mainly agricultural land&#13;
where grain production is dominant. Wild animals in the area include wild ox, river deer,&#13;
racoon dog, wild boar, pangolin and various kinds of birds, frogs, butterflies. In the&#13;
Xiangjiang River, there are more than 100 species of fish. main economic fish comprise&#13;
various kinds of carp.&#13;
34.   Noise and Air Quality. The proposed dam site is presently rural in character with&#13;
low noise levels. At the port areas, the noise levels reflect the urban nature of the sites.&#13;
As the project includes both rural and urban areas, the air quality ranges from excellent to&#13;
fair. Air quality degradation in the urban areas can be attributed to the handling and&#13;
combustion of coal (heating and electricity generation) followed by vehicle exhaust. In the&#13;
rural areas, particularly at the dam site, the air quality is very good.&#13;
35.   Water Quality and Sediment.  Water quality in the main sections of the&#13;
Xiangjiang River is generally good, meeting National Water Quality Standards Class 2-3,&#13;
although in some spots exceedance of trace metals have been reported. Water quality in&#13;
the port areas is affected by industrial and sanitary sewage effluent and stormwater&#13;
drainage with minimal treatment. Soil erosion resulted in increased suspended solids (SS)&#13;
and turbidity with an estimated annual loss of 4.6 million tons of soil. Sediments between&#13;
Dayuandu and Zhuzhou are relatively coarse in nature and in many areas dredging is&#13;
conducted to provide sand and gravel for construction purposes.  Analyses of the&#13;
sediments in the proposed shoal removal sites indicated median particle size diameters&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86-                       ANNEX E&#13;
(d50), which ranged typically in the 0.5 to 1 mm size and low concentrations of trace&#13;
metals.&#13;
36.   Cultural Relics.  The ancient remains scattered in 51 places and historical&#13;
buildings are not included in the project-affected areas. No underground cultural relics&#13;
were discovered by the field surveys.&#13;
Potential Environmental Impacts and their Mitigation Measures&#13;
37.   Inundation of Lands. In order to minimize flooding as a result of the headpond&#13;
creation, the dam design was modified to provide a wider overflow section, a lower sill&#13;
elevation (close to natural river bed elevation) and a lower open-gate dam. Some of the&#13;
existing dikes and flood control structures will be reinforced. Based on this, a headpond&#13;
will have a water level elevation of 0.07-0.17 m higher than the 20-year flood level&#13;
elevation and the inundated areas will be relatively small (approximately 23 ha).&#13;
38.   Water Logging. At present, extensive areas upstream of the Dayuandu site are&#13;
below the normal water level in the embankment and have to be pumped or specially&#13;
drained due to existing water levels. With the establishment of a permanent higher water&#13;
level, such measures as control of water entry, additional pumping and better water&#13;
control structures will be extended to deal with the hydrological changes and prevent&#13;
waterlogging.&#13;
39.   Impedance of Fish Migration. The upper reaches of the Xiangjiang River above&#13;
Dayuandu are well known as major fish spawning areas, particularly for various species of&#13;
carp. Creation of the dam/shiplock and regulation of the river levels below the dam will&#13;
alter the physical characteristics of the river and directly impede fish movement. To&#13;
facilitate fish migrations to the upper reaches of the Xiangjiang River, a fish ladder and&#13;
monitoring facility will be constructed to one side of the dam/shiplock. Fish aquaculture&#13;
activities will also be promoted in the reservoir.&#13;
40.   Noise and Air Pollution. During the construction phase, heavy machineries with&#13;
significant noise will be restricted to the daytime. Use of construction machineries with&#13;
low noise will be encouraged and asphalt mixer with waste gas purifier will be used to&#13;
prevent air pollution. Special type of trucks will be used to prevent noise and dust by&#13;
transportation of construction materials. Water will be sprayed as appropriate to control&#13;
dust. Trees and grass will be planted after the construction works are completed. During&#13;
the operation phase, the Hunan Provincial Communications Department (HPCD) will&#13;
strictly enforce noise related regulations for vessels, in particular, the use of horns at night.&#13;
The conversion to larger and newer vessels will result in noise reduction through less&#13;
noisy engines and better mufflers. In port areas, measures such as noise barriers and&#13;
greenbelts will be taken as appropriate to comply with the ambient noise standards.&#13;
During operation of the port facilities, rigorous dust control measures will be&#13;
implemented, particularly for the control of coal dust, both during storage and loading/&#13;
unloading. Dust will be controlled through water sprays. BPCD will strictly enforce&#13;
regulations to reduce air pollution attributed to vessel exhaust.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -                      ANNEX E&#13;
41.   Water Pollution Control. During construction of dam/shiplock, wastewater from&#13;
construction site and camps will be discharged to the river only after adequately treated.&#13;
Solid wastes will be regularly collected and disposed in an adequate manner.&#13;
42.   The navigational channel will be upgraded through blasting and shoal removal of&#13;
23 shoals. The removed materials will be used in the river regulation works and infilling&#13;
deeper areas of the river. This activity will result in limited water pollution (mainly SS and&#13;
turbidity), and noise and safety hazards during blasting. The analysis of the sediments in&#13;
the proposed shoal sites indicated low concentrations of trace metals and therefore little&#13;
possibility of contamination. Nevertheless, the removed shoals will be disposed of in the&#13;
approved disposal sites when the analysis prior to the activities indicates pollution by trace&#13;
metals. In order to minimize impacts on fish and fish migration, the shoal removal will not&#13;
be carried out in fish migration seasons and the respective activities will be limited in a&#13;
small scale.&#13;
43.   There are several drinking water intakes located within the urban sections of the&#13;
river in Zhuzhou and Hengyang. The Hunan Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau,&#13;
in association with local EPBs, has undertaken in 1992 a comprehensive water pollution&#13;
control study of the Xiangjiang. On the basis of this study, the EPBs have developed&#13;
plans for the protection of drinking water supply, reduction of industrial effluent and&#13;
treatment of sanitary sewage. Both the Zhuzhou and Hengyang have been implementing&#13;
these plans that should result in significant water quality improvements in those sections of&#13;
the river within 10 years.&#13;
44.   In support of these plans, HPCD has been implementing various regulations and&#13;
measures to minimize water pollution from navigation activities, including (i) strict&#13;
enforcement of regulations to prevent disposal of oily water and other ship wastes from&#13;
vessels, (ii) construction of treatment facilities for oily water and sanitary sewage from&#13;
shipping and port facilities, (iii) collection and disposal of solid wastes from shipping and&#13;
port activities, (iv) prevention of accidental spill of hazardous substances from vessels&#13;
through a prior approval system and an emergency response plan.&#13;
45.   Reception and treatment facilities for ships wastes will include oil/water treatment&#13;
separators at the two ports. These facilities will also serve port operations and ensure that&#13;
oily discharges will contain less than the national standard of 10 mg/L petroleum&#13;
hydrocarbons. Similarly the Hunan Xiangjiang Navigation Construction and Development&#13;
Corporation (HXNCDC) will operate facilities at the ports for the reception and treatment&#13;
(to secondary level) of sanitary sewage. Garbage and solid wastes will be collected at the&#13;
ports and disposed through municipal facilities.&#13;
46.   Limited monitoring of contaminants in fish was undertaken in the river, most&#13;
recently by the Changsha Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau in 1992. The&#13;
results indicated that all trace metals concentrations meet State and international&#13;
guidelines.  HXNCDC  will also work closely with relevant agencies to assess&#13;
accumulation of pollutants in fish and will undertake monitoring during the construction&#13;
and operation phases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -                     ANNEX E&#13;
Environmental Monitoring&#13;
47.   At present, the Hunan Provincial Environmental Monitoring Center (HPEMC) and&#13;
the Zhuzhou and Hengyang EPBs are carrying out extensive routine monitoring programs&#13;
for air, noise and water quality throughout the project area. In coordination with these&#13;
programs, HXNCDC will implement an extensive environmental monitoring program&#13;
during the construction and operation phases.&#13;
48.   Air PoHlution. During port construction, dust as measured by dustfall jars will be&#13;
monitored on a weekly basis at four to six sites surrounding each of the two ports. TSP&#13;
will be monitored once per week at four sites. SO2 and NO. will not be monitored during&#13;
construction as monitoring is presently conducted in the urban areas by the municipal&#13;
environmental monitoring centers on a routine basis. During the port operation, dust will&#13;
be monitored weekly, and TSP, SO2 and NO. once per month at four sites. At the dam&#13;
site, during construction the dustfall and TSP monitoring will be the similar to that for the&#13;
ports. Monitoring for SO2 and NO. will be conducted once per month at four sites.&#13;
During operation, there will be no air pollution monitoring at the dam sites on the basis&#13;
that the potential sources will either be no different or less than before the dam&#13;
construction.&#13;
49.   Water Pollution.  Present routine water quality monitoring includes eight&#13;
standard transects monitored 3 to 12 times per year. In addition to this, during removal of&#13;
a particular shoal or construction of the two ports, monthly monitoring will be undertaken&#13;
for selected substances/parameters at the nearest downstream monitoring transect.&#13;
Further, more intensive monitoring for dissolved oxygen (DO) and suspended solids (SS)&#13;
will be undertaken during construction activities. Monitoring during the dam/shiplock&#13;
construction will be similar, except that the monthly monitoring will not be undertaken.&#13;
During the operation phase, monitoring will be carried out three times per year at eight&#13;
routine transects.&#13;
50.   Noise. During construction of the channel, the ports and the dani/shiplock noise&#13;
will be monitored daily by construction supervision personnel using small noise monitoring&#13;
equipment. At the quarries and along the transport routes, noise monitoring will be&#13;
undertaken in the morning, afternoon and evening. During the operation phase, noise will&#13;
be monitored along the river and at the ports one day per week at three different times a&#13;
day.&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
51.   To implement the project, HPCD has set up an independent wholly-owned&#13;
subsidiary company, the Hunan Xiangjiang Navigation Construction and Development&#13;
Corporation (HXNCDC). Within this company, there will be an Environmental Protection&#13;
Office (EPO: 2-3 staff) and three Environmental Protection Sections (EPS: 2-3 staff&#13;
respectively) at Dayuandu and the Zhuzhou and Hengyang Ports. The EPO and the&#13;
Dayuandu EPS will be established before negotiations with the Bank and the other two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89-                      ANNEX E&#13;
EPSs before the construction of the ports. All monitoring will be undertaken under&#13;
contract to Zhuzhou and Hengyang EPBs.&#13;
52.   The EPO and EPSs have the responsibility for preparing appropriate documents&#13;
under the World Bank loan, undertaking environmental supervision of the construction&#13;
activities, implementing appropriate mitigative measures, coordinating and managing the&#13;
environmental protection during the construction and operational phases of the project.&#13;
53.   The Hunan Provincial EPB  and local EPBs have the responsibility for&#13;
environmental management and supervision within their jurisdictions, including&#13;
coordination and general supervision on and assistance for the environmental aspects of&#13;
the project.&#13;
54.   While the Provincial and local EPBs are adequately staffed and equipped to&#13;
undertake the monitoring related to this project, the HXNCDC environmental staff will&#13;
require additional training, particularly in the management of mitigative measures and&#13;
monitoring programs. A budget of Y 20,000 and $40,000 has been allocated for&#13;
environmental training, which enables 8 person-months of training in China and 5 person-&#13;
months abroad.&#13;
D. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF GUANGXI PROJECT COMPONENT&#13;
Major Project Components&#13;
55.   The Xijiang drains much of the watershed within Guangxi.  Upgrading the&#13;
waterway to accommodate 1,000 dwt vessels (National Waterway Class 3) between&#13;
Nanning and Guangzhou will greatly benefit transport of bulk raw materials (particularly&#13;
coal for power generation and heating) from Guangxi and Yunnan to Guangdong and the&#13;
return transport of manufactured goods. Creation of a series of navigable headponds has&#13;
proven to be the most economical method of upgrading the inland waterway system.&#13;
Construction of a hydroelectric power dam and two-stage shiplock at Xijin (Phase I&#13;
Project), which was completed in the late 1960s, permitted Class 3 navigation from&#13;
Nanning to Xijin. Phase II Project, a hydroelectric power dam and shiplock at Guiping&#13;
City permitted Class 3 navigation up to Guigang.&#13;
56.   The major project components in Guangxi will include (i) construction of a dam/&#13;
shiplock and related inundation protection structures and 120 MW hydropower station at&#13;
Guigang, and (ii) removal of shoals at three sites in the navigation channel. The proposed&#13;
project will complete the missing section. A major economic benefit will be the generation&#13;
of hydroelectric power, which will offset costs related to construction and operation of the&#13;
navigation facilities.&#13;
57.   Much of the waterway transport will provide coal to Guangdong Province from&#13;
Yunnan. While outside of the present project, the transportation of coal will require the&#13;
construction and operation of a new coal transfer (rail to waterway) terminal near&#13;
Nanning. The EIA for this project will be undertaken about 1998 near the completion of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -                      ANNEX E&#13;
this project. Several hundred hectares of irrigation activities are anticipated after the&#13;
completion of the project, for which an EIA will also be carried out according to the&#13;
Chinese regulations.&#13;
Baseline Environmental Description&#13;
58.   Geography. The Xijiang River is a major tributary of the Zhujiang, a river basin&#13;
system that drains much of south-western China and discharges through a major delta&#13;
system near the international ports of Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Macau. The river&#13;
system has served as a major transportation link to the outward transport of raw materials&#13;
from the inland provinces and inward transport of manufactured and imported goods from&#13;
the coastal provinces. The dam/shiplock will be located about 6 km upstream from the&#13;
center of Guigang. The site is a historic floodplain of a meandering river, characterized by&#13;
a flat topography with occasional limestone outcrops and deep fertile fluvial soils. At&#13;
present, river flow is much reduced in dry seasons, exposing some 22 shallows and rocky&#13;
shoals between Guigang and Xijin.&#13;
59.   Hydrological and Meteorological Conditions. Guangxi lies in southwest China&#13;
adjacent to Viet Nam. The region has a subtropical monsoon climate with distinct rainy&#13;
and dry seasons. Rainy seasons are marked by heavy monsoon precipitation lasting from&#13;
April to late August. Dry seasons extend from September to March. Rainfall averages at&#13;
1,450 mm and temperature averages at 21.50C.&#13;
60.   Population and Economy. The project area has a population of 11.4 million,&#13;
approximately 90 percent of which are rural depending on farming and aquaculture. Some&#13;
40 percent are non-Han nationalities, with a large majority of these being Zhuang. These&#13;
nationalities are well integrated with the exception of limited isolated villages that are&#13;
predominately Zhuang. The project area lies within the main agricultural zone for&#13;
Guangxi producing about 27 percent of the provincial agricultural output. Agricultural&#13;
production has been historically constrained due to poor transportation linkages,&#13;
inadequate power availability, and frequent cycles of drought and flooding. Major&#13;
industries in the project area include processing of sugar and other foodstuffs; the&#13;
manufacture of steel and cement.&#13;
61.   Ecological Environment. The terrain of the project area is generally mountainous&#13;
to the north with low-lying plains to the south. The Xijiang River flows through the Xijin&#13;
step area and into the proposed reservoir from the southwest to the northeast, forming a&#13;
U-shaped valley. While sections of the river are impeded by rock shoals and shallows,&#13;
most of the river is wide with a reasonable flow. The proposed project area has been&#13;
heavily developed and diversity of plant species is low. Forest cover that originally&#13;
dominated the area has been destroyed and replaced by cash crops, shrubs and grassland.&#13;
Birds and reptile species are the predominant wildlife species, most of which will not be&#13;
seriously affected because of the distance of their habitats from the river.&#13;
62.   Noise and Air Quality. Noise levels near the dam site are consistent with urban&#13;
center noise and also affected by a large cement factory. Vehicular noise is relatively&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91-                        ANNEX E&#13;
limited at present as the road system is still very rudimentary at the site. As the dam/&#13;
shiplock project site lies near Guigang, the air quality reflects the air quality conditions in&#13;
the City. As with many other cities in China, the quality varies depending primarily on the&#13;
volumes of coal being burned for power generation and heating. In addition, near the site&#13;
is a major cement factory and several food processing (mostly sugar) factories. The&#13;
channel sections are primarily in a rural area with relatively good air quality.&#13;
63.   Water Quality. The Xijiang has generally good water quality (National Water&#13;
Quality Standard Class 2), except where the river receives discharges from major&#13;
industrial facilities and urban centers (reduction to Class 3 or in some instances, Class 4).&#13;
In particular, the river section just below the proposed dam is affected by several large&#13;
industrial discharges, the urban discharges of Guigang City and indirect industrial and&#13;
sanitary sewage inputs via the Liyujiang River. While the dam flow will provide a more&#13;
consistent flow and therefore dilution/dispersion during the year, problems may arise&#13;
during retention of water in the headpond in dry seasons.&#13;
64.   Cultural/Historic Locations. Thirteen cultural/historical sites will be inundated.&#13;
One is an ancient city (Nan/Qing dynasties), the others are Neolithic age relics. These&#13;
cultural/historical relics will be either removed from the reservoir or will be elevated above&#13;
the maximum design storage water elevation.&#13;
Potential Environmental Impacts and their Mitigation Measures&#13;
65.   Inundation of Lands.  The inundated area will be approximately 450 ha,&#13;
consisting of 169 ha of rice paddies and 100 ha of dry cultivated lands. Much of the actual&#13;
inundation will occur along the tributaries of the Xijiang River rather than the river itself&#13;
The river basin has long been subject to flooding and an extensive series of flood control&#13;
and drainage structures have been constructed. Inundation will be minimized through the&#13;
use of existing flood and drainage control structures (111 structures protecting about&#13;
7,000 ha), improvements to existing structures and the construction of new structures (46&#13;
structures protecting about 716 ha). To offset the loss of agricultural lands, an intensive&#13;
program to upgrade poor or low-value lands will be undertaken, including irrigation.&#13;
Existing wastelands and barren hills will be shifted to the growing of orchards and tea.&#13;
Aquaculture will be significantly extended.&#13;
66.   Cultural Relics. Thirteen cultural/historical sites to be inundated will be either&#13;
removed from the reservoir or will be elevated above the maximum design storage water&#13;
elevation. A detailed final survey will be performed before excavation. If additional relics&#13;
are found at any point in the construction process, work will be immediately suspended&#13;
until an inventory can be made by relevant authorities.&#13;
67.   Noise and Air Pollution.   Air and noise pollution at the dam/shiplock&#13;
construction site will be directly related to actual construction activities, and will be&#13;
relatively short term. Water will be sprayed as appropriate to control dust, and the roads&#13;
for transportation of construction materials will be paved and the number of trucks will be&#13;
restricted. Noise and air pollution in the operation phase at the dam/shiplock site will arise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -                      ANNEX E&#13;
from increased shipping activities but the impact is considered to be insignificant based on&#13;
analysis of the current situation at the Guiping dan/shiplock.   The Guangxi&#13;
Communications Department (GCD) will strictly enforce noise and air pollution-related&#13;
regulations for vessels through regular inspection of vessels.&#13;
68.   Water Pollution Control. After creation of the headpond, rock outcroppings in&#13;
three sections (Jier, Fubo and Difu) of the river will be blasted and removed&#13;
(approximately 100,000 m3) to permit adequate navigational depth. These materials will&#13;
be used in either project construction or, in limited cases, to infill deeper sections of the&#13;
river. There will be a low potential for pollution from the shoal removal or river&#13;
regulation activities.&#13;
69.   The Guangxi Environmental Protection Bureau and local EPBs have undertaken in&#13;
1992 a comprehensive water pollution control study of the Xijiang River as part of a&#13;
multiprovincial Zhujiang Watershed and River Basin water pollution control study. On the&#13;
basis of this study, the EPBs are developing plans for the protection of drinking water&#13;
supply, reduction of industrial effluent and treatment of sanitary sewage.&#13;
70.   There are several drinking water intakes located within the urban section of the&#13;
river in Guigang and downstream of the proposed dam. Of these, the Central Intake,&#13;
located about 2 km downstream, is suffered from deteriorated water quality and might be&#13;
further affected by the project. The Guigang waterworks has decided to relocate this&#13;
intake to upstream of the dam site, in order to substantially improve the water quality.&#13;
Other efforts will include industrial effluent treatment and reduction at source. During the&#13;
Eighth Five-Year Plan, the Guangxi government has been trying to meet the goal of no&#13;
further quality degradation in spite of increased industrialization. During the Ninth Five-&#13;
Year Plan, further pollution abatement plans will be implemented with the goal of&#13;
upgrading the river water quality in the urban areas.&#13;
71.   In support of the provincial plans for water pollution control, GCD has been&#13;
implementing various regulations and measures to minimize water pollution from&#13;
navigation activities, including (i) strict enforcement of regulations to prevent disposal of&#13;
oily water and other ship wastes from vessels, (ii) collection and disposal of solid wastes&#13;
from shipping and port activities, (iii) prevention of accidental spill of hazardous&#13;
substances from vessels through a prior approval system and an emergency response plan.&#13;
72.   While no monitoring of contaminants in fish has been undertaken in the Xijiang&#13;
River, the project will work closely with relevant agencies to assess accumulation of&#13;
pollutants in fish and will undertake monitoring during the construction and operation&#13;
phases.&#13;
73.   Quarry. The quarry is located about 12 km from the dam site. The large rock&#13;
outcrop is presently located in the center of sugar fields, with the nearest villages about&#13;
1.5 km away. This quarry will be able to supply 700,000 m3 of rock. In order to control&#13;
noise and blasting effects, blasting will only be undertaken twice per day and there will be&#13;
five monitoring sites between the quarry and the nearest villages. Another major impact&#13;

will be truck traffic to and from the dam site. Current projections are for 16-25 trucks&#13;
each way per hour from 08:00 to 18:00 for the four-year duration of the construction.&#13;
Arrangements have been made to lease an access road from the nearest road and to&#13;
upgrade the road through widening and paving. Monitoring will also be undertaken along&#13;
the traffic route to assess the impact of increased truck traffic.&#13;
Environmental Monitoring&#13;
74.   At present, the Guangxi Provincial Environmental Monitoring Center (GEMC), in&#13;
cooperation with relevant municipal environmental monitoring centers, is carrying out a&#13;
program of water quality monitoring at several sites along the Xijiang River. Following&#13;
national practice, these stations are monitored three times each year for the standard water&#13;
quality parameters. In addition, each municipal environmental monitoring center is&#13;
implementing detailed air, noise, soil and water quality monitoring on a more focused basis&#13;
within the municipal boundaries.&#13;
75.   For this project, GCD will establish, within the Xijiang Project Headquarters&#13;
(XJPH) an Environmental Protection Office with the mandate to coordinate environmental&#13;
monitoring and project activities with the Provincial and the Hengxian and Guigang EPBs.&#13;
An extensive environmental monitoring program will be carried out by XJPH during the&#13;
construction and operation phases, in coordination and cooperation with EPBs.&#13;
76.   Air Pollution. During the construction, dustfall measurement will be undertaken&#13;
on a weekly basis at eight sites around the dam construction site. TSP will be monitored&#13;
one day per week at four sites around the dam construction site. SO2 and NO. will be&#13;
monitored one day every two months at the same monitoring sites. During the operation,&#13;
there will be no air pollution monitoring on the basis that the potential sources will either&#13;
be no different or less than before the dam construction.&#13;
77.   Water Pollution. Present routine water quality monitoring includes four standard&#13;
transects monitored three times each year. In addition to this, during the removal of a&#13;
particular shoal, monthly monitoring will be undertaken for selected substances/parameters&#13;
at the nearest downstream monitoring transect. Further, more intensive monitoring for&#13;
dissolved oxygen (DO) and suspended solids (SS) will be undertaken every two days&#13;
during shoal blasting and removal. Monitoring during the dam/shiplock construction will&#13;
be carried out at Luchon transect (about 3 km upriver of the dam), 500 m downstream of&#13;
the construction sites and 50 m upstream of Guigang Water Intake, one day per week&#13;
during construction. Further, during the construction of the coffer dams and after their&#13;
removal, sampling for DO and SS will be undertaken at the Luchon transect and at new&#13;
transects (200 m, 400 m, 800 m and 1,600 m downstream of the coffer dam). During the&#13;
operation, monitoring will be carried out three times per year at the four routine transects.&#13;
78.   Noise. Blasting noise will be monitored twice per week on each shore during&#13;
actual blasting. Blasting noise at the quarry will be monitored at four sites around the&#13;
quarry. Noise at the dam/shiplock site will be monitored three times daily at the four air&#13;
&#13;

pollution monitoring sites.  During the operation phase, noise monitoring will be&#13;
undertaken at five sites around the dam one day per month.&#13;
79.   Ecological Monitoring. Three monitoring sites have been established in the&#13;
Xijiang system for phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos and aquatic plants. Accumulation&#13;
of toxic substances in fish will be analyzed semiannually downstream of the project site.&#13;
Surveys of ecological habitats will be performed on an annual basis to ensure that there&#13;
will be no impacts on wild or endangered animals in the project area. The monitoring will&#13;
be undertaken by the Guigang and Hengxian Municipal EPBs.&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
80.  In order to implement the project, GCD has set up the Xijiang Project&#13;
Headquarters (XJPH). Within XJPH, the Environmental Protection Office (EPO: 2 staff)&#13;
will be set up in early 1995.&#13;
81.   The EPO has the responsibility for preparing appropriate documents under the&#13;
World Bank loan, undertaking environmental supervision of the construction activities,&#13;
implementing appropriate mitigative measures, coordinating and managing the&#13;
environmental protection during the construction and operational phases of the project.&#13;
82.   The Guangxi EPB and local EPBs have the responsibility for environmental&#13;
management and supervision within their jurisdictions, including coordination and general&#13;
supervision on and assistance for the environmental aspects of the project.&#13;
83.   Environmental monitoring during the construction and operation phases will be&#13;
undertaken by the EPO/XJPH, mainly under contract to GEMC, Hengxian and Guigang&#13;
Environmental Monitoring Centers.&#13;
84.   While the Provincial and Municipal EPBs are adequately staffed and equipped to&#13;
undertake the monitoring and supervision related to this project, the EPO staff will require&#13;
additional training, particularly in the management of mitigative measures and monitoring&#13;
programs. A budget of Y 30,000 and $48,000 has been allocated for environmental&#13;
training that enables 6 person-months of training in China and 6 person-months abroad.&#13;

from port construction to channel widening. Almost all these components involve some&#13;
degree of land acquisition and relocation of existing residents. Based on detailed surveys,&#13;
the project offices from three provinces have all prepared Resettlement Action Plans,&#13;
which are the basis for this Annex. According to these RAPs, the project will acquire a&#13;
total of 12,186 mu of land, demolish 157,670 m2 of floor space, relocate 2,295 persons&#13;
and affect up to 12,458 persons (including both physically and economically affected&#13;
people). In addition, as many as 3,909 mu of farmland will be leased temporarily during&#13;
the project construction.&#13;
A. DAYUANDU NAVIGATION COMPLEX&#13;
2.    The proposed Dayuandu Navigation Complex is located in Hengshan County,&#13;
Hunan Province. It consists of a hydroelectric dam and shiplock. Because the new&#13;
headpond will not have a surface elevation higher than 1: 10 year flood protection&#13;
structures, there will be minimal resettlement/compensation required throughout the&#13;
headpond area. According to the survey, a total of 356.7 mu of farmland (most of them&#13;
outside flood protection structures) will be affected and only 3 households and 16 people&#13;
will be relocated. On the other hand, more significant relocation will be caused by the&#13;
land acquisition at the dam site. Based on the revised RAP, a total of 723.4 mu of land&#13;
area (494 mu cultivated land) will be acquired, which involves relocating 74 households&#13;
(367 people). A total of 17,823 m2 of floor space will be demolished. All relocated&#13;
households will be moved a new settlement site near existing village, which is planned to&#13;
be developed into the new township center. Among all the people to be relocated (383),&#13;
about 190 farmers require alternative employment due to significant land loss. According&#13;
to the RAP, most of them will be provided nonfarm jobs in local township-run factories,&#13;
which ranges from county construction company (100), quarry (42), and farming tool&#13;
factory (30) in Hengshan county to Dayuandu Brick Factory in Hengdong County (14).&#13;
B. PORT EXPANSION IN ZHUZHOU AND HENGYANG&#13;
3.    The second component in Hunan is to expand the port facilities in two cities along&#13;
the Xiangjiang River. This involves three ports in Zhuzhou and two ports in Hengyang.&#13;
Unlike the Dayuandu complex, this component will mainly involve land acquisition and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-103 -                      ANNEXF&#13;
resettlement within the built-up area. According to the RAP, a total of 118.04 mu of&#13;
urban land will be acquired, which requires relocating 102 urban families or 327 persons.&#13;
Following the well-established urban resettlement process in China, the relocated families&#13;
will be given new apartment housing to be built within 2 km of the existing site, which will&#13;
have larger space and better facilities.&#13;
C. GuiGANG NAVIGATION COMPLEX (DAM SITE)&#13;
4.    In Guangxi, the proposed project is to build a hydroelectric dam and shiplock at&#13;
Guigang City in order to permit Class 3 navigation along Xijiang River. The impacts of&#13;
this project consists of two parts. One is the land acquisition and resettlement caused by&#13;
the dam site construction. The other impact is mainly due to the inundation after the dam&#13;
is completed. The land acquisition and relocation program for the dam site was already&#13;
completed by the end of 1994. According to the Guangxi Communications Department, a&#13;
total of 1,509 mu of land area were acquired. Although the land acquisition only involved&#13;
relocating seven households (30 people), due to relatively low cultivated land area per&#13;
capita, it did affect many villagers economically. After land acquisition, as many as 368&#13;
households or 1,560 persons will be given nonagricultural status. Among them, 914&#13;
people will be assigned new nonfarm jobs. Guigang City Navigation Complex Project&#13;
Preparation Agency has identified 10 companies from Guigang City to employ those aged&#13;
between 18 and 35. During the transition period, these people will be provide temporary&#13;
employment in the construction site. In general, the income from these nonfarm jobs&#13;
(including temporary employment) ranges from Y 2,400 to Y 7,400 per year, substantially&#13;
higher than that from farming. In addition, under the assistance of municipal government,&#13;
they will be organized to set up shops in a shopping street; or be provided with porter jobs&#13;
in Jianyitan Port. The employment program and income restoration activities will be&#13;
carefully reviewed and monitored by Guangxi Electric Power Design and Survey Institute&#13;
under the contract of resettlement monitoring and evaluation by the Guangxi Provincial&#13;
Communication Department.&#13;
D. GUIGANG NAVIGATION COMPLEX (RESERVOIR AREA)&#13;
5.    The second part of resettlement impact is the inundation by newly created&#13;
headponds. Because the raised water level is relatively small, and because a series of&#13;
embankment projects will be constructed to minimize resettlement, no houses will be&#13;
affected and no people need to be relocated. Instead, the main impacts is inundation of&#13;
farmland in some low-lying areas of tributaries. According to the RAP submitted by the&#13;
Guangxi Communication Department, a total of 6,904 mu land area will be inundated,&#13;
among which, 4,106 mu will be cultivated land. Because of land loss, a total of 4,740&#13;
farmers will need alternative employment. A detailed income restoration scheme has been&#13;
developed for the affected people, which ranges from creating new farmnland, planting fruit&#13;
trees to nonfarm employment in county-run factories.&#13;
6.    The majority of affected people, a total of 3,779, will be resettled through fruit tree&#13;
planting. The reservoir area enjoys a temperate climate and favorable soil conditions for&#13;
fruit growing. The hills slop gently at less than 25 degrees; the soil pH value is between 5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-104 -                      ANNEX F&#13;
and 6. There are fruit production offices staffed with horticulturists in the two affected&#13;
counties. A total of 4,662.5 mu of slop land have been identified and will be developed&#13;
into fruit orchards. Since most of lost land is paddy field, in order to maintain certain level&#13;
of grain production for local consumption, about 13,389 mu of low-yield farmland will be&#13;
upgraded; and another 1,849 mu of wasteland will be developed into new farmland.&#13;
About 915 farmers will be resettled through farmland intensification and creation. Finally,&#13;
about 300 people will be resettled through a number of township enterprises, such as a&#13;
cannery and starch mill in Guigang, Qiaoxu County and a brick tile yard in Hengxian&#13;
County. A detailed implementation schedule has been developed, which will enable the&#13;
affected farmers to receive compensation and start their income restoration programs in&#13;
1995, at least two to three years before their land is inundated. The implementation of the&#13;
resettlement program will also be monitored carefully by the Guangxi Electric Power&#13;
Design and Survey Institute under the same contract.&#13;
E. CANAL AND PORT IMPROVEMENT IN ZHEJIANG&#13;
7.    In Zhejiang Province, the proposed project component consists of seven smaller&#13;
projects, which mainly involve in channel widening and ports expansion in a number cities&#13;
in Zhejiang. According to the RAP, these projects will acquire a total of 2,475 mu of land&#13;
permanently, and relocate 514 households or 1,555 people by demolishing a total of&#13;
123,663 m2 of floor space. Most of the affected households will be given a house plot&#13;
within the same villages near the existing sites to rebuild their houses.&#13;
8.    The loss of land will also affect 4,272 farmers. According to the compensation&#13;
policies, they will be given either new farmland or alternative employment. As many as&#13;
3,960 of them will be resettled through land readjustment within their villages. And 312&#13;
of them, most of them due to port construction in Huzhou, Jiaxing and Hangzhou, will be&#13;
resettled through nonfarm employment. The land acquisition is taking place along a&#13;
narrow strip, which means a relative small land area will be taken in any affected village&#13;
(while any concentrated land acquisition, such as in the case of two port projects in&#13;
Huzhou and Jiaxing, will often result in changing registration and providing nonfarm&#13;
employment for some villagers). The preproject income levels of the affected farmers will&#13;
be maintained or improved through a process that combines land redistribution and&#13;
provision of nonagricultural jobs in enterprises. The per capita landholding after land&#13;
acquisition will be maintained at preproject levels. The number of persons to be provided&#13;
nonagricultural enterprise jobs in each village will be calculated in a manner that ensures&#13;
that the per capita landholding after land acquisition is equal to the per capita landholding&#13;
before acquisition.&#13;
9.    After land adjustment for foodgrain land, the village will select those for nonfarm&#13;
employment by lottery. Each family could only have one member participate the lottery.&#13;
The local labor bureau will be responsible for assigning jobs for the selected people. Some&#13;
of those qualified people could choose to be self-employed with proven specific skills.&#13;
They will be given Y 10,000 to Y 12,000 as a one-time payment. The implementation of&#13;
resettlement and income restoration activities will monitored and reviewed annually by an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

independent research institute, Hangzhou University, Population and Urbanization&#13;
Research Institute.&#13;
10.   In addition to the permanent land acquisition, during the project construction,&#13;
another 3,909 mu of land area may be leased for construction use and soil pilings.&#13;
However, the figure is only preliminary estimate based on the engineering designs.&#13;
According to project staff, the actual amount of borrowing land may be significantly&#13;
smaller for two reasons. One is that currently any contractor is able to rent vacant from&#13;
farmers in the region, which could significantly reduce amount of land area needed for&#13;
temporary office and housing. The second reason is that there are many potential users of&#13;
dug soils, ranging from brick factory to other infrastructure construction, which could&#13;
significantly reduce the amount of land area for soil pilings. In terms of compensation&#13;
policy, the project office will pay Y 3,000 per mu for the annual yield loss and will be&#13;
responsible for restoring the soil back to original condition after the construction.&#13;
Purpose and Strategy of Resettlement&#13;
11.   For the project offices in three provinces, one main objective of resettlement&#13;
efforts is to minimize the scope of resettlement throughout the project design and&#13;
planning. For example, for the two navigation complexes in Hunan and Guangxi, the&#13;
engineers worked closely with resettlement experts during the design and planning stage in&#13;
order to minimize the amount of land acquisition and resettlement. In Guangxi, along with&#13;
the construction of the proposed hydroelectric dam, a comprehensive program of&#13;
reinforcing existing dikes and constructing new ones in key areas has also be planned in&#13;
order to minimize the inundation impacts. As a result, the project will not increase&#13;
floodwater levels during the rainy season and any inundation will be limited in low-lying&#13;
areas, below the design reservoir operating water level and primarily in the tributaries.&#13;
Similar efforts have also been made in determining sites for other project components,&#13;
such as port development and channel widening components in Zhejiang in order to&#13;
minimize demolition and land acquisition.&#13;
12.   For those inundation, demolition or land acquisition that could not be avoided,&#13;
proper compensation and rehabilitation will be made. For example, in the Dayuandu&#13;
project, the 74 relocated households from Yonghe Village, due to the construction of the&#13;
shiplock, will be resettled near the existing site, which is designated as the new town&#13;
center for the whole Shatou Township. A detailed implementation schedule for new&#13;
settlement construction has already been developed, which will ensure that the resettlers&#13;
move to new housing before their existing one is demolished. In order to minimize&#13;
disruption and allow time for new housing construction, the project office in Zhejiang has&#13;
agreed to sign compensation contracts and allocate compensation funds to resettlers 6&#13;
months before the actual land acquisition&#13;
13.   For those households who are living in the urban settings, such as the case in&#13;
Zhuzhou and Hengyang, they will be resettled in newly constructed apartment housing&#13;
within reasonable commuting distance. All new housing will be equipped with electricity,&#13;
modem kitchens and private bathrooms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-106-                       ANNEX F&#13;
14.   For those farmers who lose farmland due to land acquisition and inundation, like&#13;
the cases in Hunan, Guangxi and Zhejiang, they will be provided alternative means of&#13;
production through proper compensation. Some of them will be provided new farmland&#13;
through land readjustment (Zhejiang) or through converting wasteland to farmland&#13;
(Guangxi); some of them will involve in fruit trees planting by taking advantage of favorite&#13;
local conditions (Guangxi); and some others will be provided nonfarm jobs, including&#13;
employment in city factories and local TVEs, which often bring much higher income for&#13;
the resettlers.&#13;
Legal Framework&#13;
15.   Forming the legal basis for land acquisition and resettlement of the Inland&#13;
Waterways Development Project are both laws or regulations from the state, and&#13;
implementation measures from provincial and local municipalities. The state laws or&#13;
regulations include: 'Land Administration Law"(1986), 'City Planning Act"(1990), and&#13;
'Administrative Regulation of Urban Building Demolition and Relocation" (1991). The&#13;
local implementation measures in three provinces include:  'Zhejiang Provincial&#13;
Implementation Regulation of the Land Administration Law" (1987); 'Guangxi Provincial&#13;
Implementation Regulation of the Land Administration Law" (1987); 'Hunan Provincial&#13;
Implementation of the Land Administration Law" (1987) and some related regulations&#13;
adopted by concerned Municipal governments in three provinces.&#13;
16.   Under this project, there are two types of land acquisition. One is to acquire rural&#13;
land from farmers. According to the 'Land Administration Law", section 1, article 2:&#13;
'for the public interest, the state could expropriate collectively owned farmland." The&#13;
essence of the policy is that when the state acquire farmland, the land-using units will pay&#13;
not only a basic compensation for land, standing crop and attached properties, but also a&#13;
resettlement compensation (articles 28 of the 'Land Administration Law'). The other&#13;
type of land acquisition is to acquire land use rights within the urban built-up area, since&#13;
all urban land are owned by the state.  In this case, according to 'Administrative&#13;
Regulation of Urban Building Demolition and Relocation," the construction unit has to&#13;
provide adequate compensation or resettlement housing for the displaced families and&#13;
affected enterprises.&#13;
17.   Resettlement subsidy for cultivated land acquisition is determined by the number of&#13;
agricultural population to be resettled. The number is calculated according to the area of&#13;
acquired land, divided by the average per capita landholding prior to land acquisition&#13;
within the village or production team. Per resettler subsidy is the average per mu output&#13;
value three years prior to land acquisition, multiplied by a factor. The Land Law stipulates&#13;
2 or 3 as the multiplier and provinces have issued different multipliers according to the&#13;
size of the per capita landholding. The resettlement compensation could increase up to 10&#13;
times the average annual output. If the land compensation and resettlement compensation&#13;
still cannot guarantee the farmer's original living standard according to regulation, the total&#13;
land compensation may be increased to a level no more than 20 times the average annual&#13;
output value per mu in the three years before acquisition. A detailed breakdown of the&#13;
land acquisition compensation is presented in the next section.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-107 -                       ANNEX F&#13;
18.   The compensation  earmarked  for resettlement will be used  to  generate&#13;
employment for displaced labors or to provide pension for the elderly. The county&#13;
government through its land administration bureau will be responsible for creating&#13;
nonfarm jobs for the affected farmers, or assisting local township and village-owned&#13;
enterprises to hire displaced village labors.&#13;
19.   Among various items in land compensation, only young crop compensation and&#13;
attached properties will be paid directly to individuals. The rest of land compensation will&#13;
be paid to affected villages or production teams. Resettlement subsidy will be either paid&#13;
to the enterprises that employ the eligible resettlers or to the affected villages or&#13;
production teams.   The Land Law  and provincial regulations stipulate that all&#13;
compensation funds paid to villages or production teams should be used for productive&#13;
purposes or as stipends for those unable to work. By law, accounts must be kept of all&#13;
village/town funds, including resettlement compensation. Financial reports have to be&#13;
provided annually to the next higher level of government.&#13;
Compensation Determination and Payment'&#13;
20.   The basic compensation policy was developed according to national laws and&#13;
provincial implementation regulations, which provides a uniform approach but also allows&#13;
for some of the valuations to be based on local conditions, growing seasons, and degree of&#13;
complexity of resettlement or disturbance to production.&#13;
21.   Land Compensation. Land compensation consists of three parts: compensation&#13;
for standing crops, compensation for land, and compensation for resettlement.&#13;
Compensation for standing crops is paid to the individual farmers and is based on a&#13;
multiple (crop-specific) of the average per mu annual output ('&lt;verage annual" is&#13;
calculated from the previous three years, allowing for poor crop years) of the lands&#13;
divided by the growing seasons for the crop. For example, in Dayuandu project (Hunan),&#13;
the average output value varies from Y 460 per mu for dryland to Y 600 per mu for paddy&#13;
field.&#13;
22.   Compensation for farmlands and compensation for resettlement are paid directly to&#13;
local collectives for productive purposes. The compensation for land is set at three to four&#13;
times of average annual yield of acquired land. While the compensation for resettlement is&#13;
about two to three times of annual average crop value per person. The number of people&#13;
qualified for resettlement compensation is determined by the amount of acquired&#13;
cultivated land divided by the ratio of arable land per capita in each local village.&#13;
23.   Based on above principles, the total value of land compensation for different&#13;
project components project varies among different locations, which is the combination of&#13;
These compensation standards may vary among different provinces and different cities or even&#13;
counties. They are at best serve as reference for negotiating final compensation amount. In&#13;
general, the negotiated compensation amounts are much higher than these standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-108 -                       ANNEX F&#13;
different crop yield, different land per capita ratio, and different social economic&#13;
conditions. For a detailed breakdown of land compensation rates for different type of land&#13;
in each province, one could refer to the resettlement action plans of three provinces (in the&#13;
project file). For temporary land leasing in Zhejiang, the estimated cost will be Y 3,000&#13;
per mu for farmland, which consists of crop replacement fee and land restoration fee.&#13;
Both of them will be paid directly to the affected land users.&#13;
24.   Property Compensation. The property compensation consists of compensation&#13;
for housing, compensation for attached facilities, and compensation for trees.&#13;
Compensation for housing is based on the reconstruction costs. New housing is to be&#13;
constructed as close as possible to the present housing and preferably within the same&#13;
village.  This policy ensures maintenance of neighborhood and communities.  The&#13;
compensation for housing is paid directly to the affected families. Other facilities, such as&#13;
power lines, communication lines, urban services and the like are compensated on a&#13;
replacement value basis through negotiation with local communities or other vested&#13;
parties.&#13;
Resettlement Institutional Responsibility&#13;
25.   In order to effectively implement the land acquisition and resettlement program&#13;
among these three provinces, a land acquisition and resettlement unit has been set up&#13;
within three provincial project offices, which is directly responsible for overall&#13;
implementation of resettlement program. In addition, similar units have also been set up in&#13;
the project offices of all subcomponents, which is often set at city level. The staff of these&#13;
land acquisition and resettlement units work closely with project engineers, and officials of&#13;
different levels of governments in planning and implementing the resettlement program.&#13;
Their main responsibilities include: (a) based on engineering design, organizing detailed&#13;
survey and measurement of the scope of land acquisition and resettlement; (b) developing&#13;
resettlement action plan for the whole project, and monitoring the actual implementation&#13;
of the plan; (c) preparing and allocating compensation funds to affected cities or counties;&#13;
and auditing the proper use of compensation funds; (d) coordinating the implementation of&#13;
land acquisition and resettlement with related local government agencies; and (e) assisting&#13;
the independent agency to conduct resettlement monitoring and evaluation for the whole&#13;
project.&#13;
26.   Under the leadership of the provincial project office, there are resettlement units&#13;
operating within the branch project offices at city level, where the project is actually&#13;
located.   These units directly involve in implementing the land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement. The main responsibilities of these resettlement units include (a) assisting the&#13;
baseline survey and land acquisition measurement; (b) monitoring the implementation&#13;
progress and use of compensation funds within related counties or districts;&#13;
(c) maintaining the records and contracts of compensation and resettlement within their&#13;
jurisdictions; (d) obtaining various project approval permits, such as, planning permit, land&#13;
use certificate, and land acquisition or demolition permits; and (e) formulating and&#13;
implementing resettlement action plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-109 -                       ANNEX F&#13;
27.   In addition to the staff arrangement within the project offices, perhaps, the more&#13;
important element is the leadership and extensive involvement of local governments in the&#13;
resettlement implementation process. Within the affected city or county, a leading group&#13;
on land acquisition will be set up, often headed by vice mayor of affected city (such as the&#13;
case in Guigang city); or vice governor of affected county (such as the case in Hengshan&#13;
County in Hunan).  The members of the leading group will come from  relevant&#13;
government agencies, such as construction commission, labor bureau, land bureau, etc. In&#13;
addition, a working group is often set up with 5 to 10 full-time staff to directly implement&#13;
the program.&#13;
28.   After consultation with affected villages and individuals, the working group of&#13;
affected city or county will directly negotiate compensation packages with the project&#13;
offices. After completion of negotiation with the project office and signing the contract,&#13;
the county in turn negotiates compensation contracts with individuals for lost private&#13;
assets, and with affected townships or villages for expropriated land. While the housing&#13;
reconstruction is often carried out by individual households with some assistance from&#13;
local township and village, the benefits of resettlement is often delivered by the local&#13;
villages, which includes making land readjustment within affected villages, assigning TVE&#13;
jobs to affected people, and using collective compensation funds for infrastructure&#13;
development or other investments that improve income or social welfare for the affected&#13;
villages. In the urban context, resettlement implementation is often carried out by the&#13;
specified municipal agencies, under the supervision of responsible project offices.&#13;
Conflict Resolution and Grievance Procedure&#13;
29.   If an affected person is not satisfied with the compensation package or if, for any&#13;
reason, the compensation does not materialize according to the agreed schedule, he or she&#13;
could go through an grievance procedure specified in the resettlement action plan. In&#13;
general, there are three different ways for anyone to resolve his grievance. The first&#13;
approach is to voice his or her complains to the responsible resettlement offices at&#13;
township or county levels. Since these resettlement offices are made of representatives&#13;
from all relevant departments, they are in much better position to resolve issues brought&#13;
by affected individuals. If the person finds that such discussion does not yield any results,&#13;
he could bring his case to the 'Public Complaint Office," which exists in both county and&#13;
municipality governments, directly under the governor's offices. The 'Public Complaint&#13;
Office" has been widely set up in China to address issues arising from local government&#13;
decisions or policies. The staff from that office, after hearing the complaint from affected&#13;
individual, will arrange meetings with responsible agencies and resolve the disputes.&#13;
Finally, if the affected persons are not satisfied with the rulings from the above two&#13;
channels, he could, within 15 days, request an administrative review of the case by the&#13;
same or higher level of government, or to appeal directly in court. This will follow the&#13;
procedure of administrative appeal, since most land acquisition and compensation&#13;
decisions are determined by local government regulations or policies.&#13;

Budget and Timetable&#13;
30.   Based on preliminary budget projection, resettlement costs will total approximately&#13;
Y 305 million, including contingencies (see below). This includes a 6 percent price&#13;
contingency and 2 percent administration expense. The resettlement action plan submitted&#13;
by three provinces included detailed cost breakdown for all project components, which&#13;
indicating both unit cost and items included. The table also includes an implementation&#13;
schedule of land acquisition and resettlement for each project component.  Land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement among five different components will be completed within&#13;
next three years.&#13;

Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
31.   According to the resettlement action plans submitted by three provinces, each&#13;
project office has set up a resettlement monitoring and evaluation during the project&#13;
implementation. Hunan province will invite the Mid-South Hydroelectric Design and&#13;
Research Institute will be invited to carry out the resettlement monitoring and evaluation&#13;
for both the Dayuandu component and Port component in Zhuzhou and Hengyang. The&#13;
Mid-South Design and Research Institute, which is also responsible for carrying out&#13;
resettlement monitoring and evaluation for the Bank-assisted Daguangba Project, has&#13;
extensive experience in resettlement planning and research. A preliminary working plan,&#13;
developed by the Mid-South Institute has been included in the revised Resettlement&#13;
Action Plan. For Guangxi Province, the monitoring and evaluation work will be carried&#13;

program is implemented according to the plan, and to see that resettlers are able to restore&#13;
their living condition and income level after relocation. The agreed outlines of the first-&#13;
year monitoring report includes reviewing resettlement progress among all components;&#13;
examining the use of resettlement funds; and assessing situation regarding production&#13;
restoration among relocated population (obs and living allowance); living condition&#13;
improvements (housing and related services and facilities); and administration capacity of&#13;
resettlement organizations. The three teams will produce resettlement progress reports&#13;
for the project offices and the Bank every year. After the completion of resettlement&#13;
activities, an evaluation report will be produced for each project components.&#13;

ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The proposed Inland Waterway Project consists of the development of inland&#13;
waterways and port of two provinces (Hunan and Zhejiang) and one autonomous region&#13;
(Guangxi). Each of the provinces and region is served by a different inland waterway&#13;
system. The proposed project covers (a) navigation improvement of two rivers and four&#13;
channels; (b) construction of two dams including two shiplocks and two power stations;&#13;
and (c) construction of five inland river ports. The developments are tabulated as follows:&#13;

Inland Waterway Operation and Expansion Plans&#13;
2.    Hunan. Hunan is a landlocked province. The Yangtze River flows through the&#13;
northern part of the province adjacent to Dongting Lake (the second largest inland&#13;
freshwater lake in China). Downstream of the Yangtze River are the port of Shanghai and&#13;
the East China Sea. Four major rivers flow from different directions of the province into&#13;
Dongting Lake. The Xiangjiang River, the largest river of the province (856 km), is the&#13;
most important to the province. This river vertically cuts across the province from south&#13;
to north, covering about 40 percent of the provincial land area. Five major cities along the&#13;
river, Changsha, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, Hengyang and Yueyang have 32 percent of the&#13;
population of the province and produced, in 1992, 46.6 percent of GDP and 38.6 percent&#13;
of industrial output of the province. The major directional flow of traffic of the province&#13;
(including railway, highway and waterway) is north-south. The proposed project is the&#13;
second phase construction of the Xiangjiang Development Plan whose purpose is to raise&#13;
the water level to allow a 1,000 ton dwt ship to sail from Zhuzhou port to Hengyang port&#13;
(total length 182 km) by building a water dam at Dayuandu area with shiplock facilities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-113 -                     ANNEX G&#13;
and a power station. The phase I construction, completed in 1994, enabled a 1,000 ton&#13;
ship to sail directly from the Yangtze River to Zhuzhou port (total length 257 km). To&#13;
fully utilize the expected large increase of the river transport capacity, two inland&#13;
waterway ports (Zhuzhou and Hengyang) will also need to be expanded accordingly. The&#13;
proposed extension includes one general cargo berth and one coal terminal (two berths) at&#13;
Zhuzhou port (downstream of Dayuandu dam) and three general cargo berths at&#13;
Hengyang port (upstream of Dayuandu dam).&#13;
3.    Guangxi. The highway provides the main means of transportation for short&#13;
distances (less than 300 km). For long distances, north-south transportation is provided&#13;
mainly by railway. West-east transportation is solely dependent on the Xijiang River (the&#13;
largest river and covers over 85 percent of total land area in the region). Some inland&#13;
provinces in the southwest of China (Guizhou and Yunnan) also depend on this river to&#13;
communicate with the outside world. These provinces are rich in coal, ores and other&#13;
natural resources that need to be transported to the downstream provinces, particularly to&#13;
Guangdong province, which has been enjoying double-digit economic growth rate during&#13;
the last 15 years but is extremely short of energy and raw materials. The proposed project&#13;
is the second phase construction of the Xijiang River Development Plan. The first phase&#13;
construction, completed in 1989, allowed 1,000 ton ship to sail direct from Guangdong to&#13;
Guigang without transshipment. The proposed project is to extend navigation for this size&#13;
of vessels from Guigang to Xijin and further to Nanning (capital of the region) by building&#13;
a dam to raise the water level in the Guigang area.&#13;
4.    Zhejiang. The proposed project is located in the northeast part of the province.&#13;
It covers the triangular area of Huzhou city (north), Jiaxing city (east) and Hangzhou city&#13;
(south). Most of land in this area is quite flat with numerous river networks to connect&#13;
the cities and rural areas that are some of the most prosperous of the province. The total&#13;
area and population of these three cities constitute about 26 percent of the province's; the&#13;
GDP and industrial output, in 1992, were 36 percent and 40.6 percent, respectively. The&#13;
area is adjacent to the suburbs of Shanghai. Historically, all local economic activities are&#13;
heavily influenced by the city of Shanghai. Shanghai exports coal and industrial products&#13;
to, and imports sand, stone, limestone and local products from, this area. The high-&#13;
density local navigational system provides the best means of transportation for these low-&#13;
valued dry-bulk cargoes due to (a) very steady year-round water volume (no dry season or&#13;
wave); (b) low water flow speed (less than 5 km per hour); and (c) no siltation problem.&#13;
The superiority of the networks has faded away lately due to the increase in traffic causing&#13;
bottlenecks and severe congestion in the channels. In particular, many old bridges, narrow&#13;
curves and shallow water cannot cope with increases of shipment size. During 1992-93,&#13;
the channel system was completely blocked 114 times due to traffic congestion, which&#13;
severely affected the local energy, manufacture and mining industries. The proposed&#13;
project is to upgrade the existing river system from class VI and/or class VII (50-100 ton&#13;
ship, 1.2-2.5 m depth and 18-22 m width) to Class V and/or Class VI (100-300 ton ship,&#13;
2.5 m depth and 35-40 m width). To cope with the renovation of the channel system, the&#13;
provincial government also decided (a) to build two new rail, highway and waterway&#13;
transshipment centers (one in Huzhou city and another one in Jiaxing city); and (b) to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Traffic Composition and Growth&#13;
Hunan&#13;
5.    The proposed project is to build a dam at Dayuandu on the Xiangjiang River,&#13;
between Hengyang (upstream) and Zhuzhou (downstream), to raise the water level for&#13;
1,000-ton ships. Currently the river can only accommodate 300-ton ships. With the&#13;
project, traffic is expected to grow faster during the first few years due to current owners&#13;
of 1,000 ton ships taking advantage of the reduction in unit transport cost by using larger&#13;
ships. For the long-terrn forecast, the traffic is likely to increase very steadily. Expansion&#13;
at two ports, Hengyang and Zhuzhou, financed locally, is also being undertaken to match&#13;
the improvement to the river. The past and future traffic growth for each project&#13;
component of the project are discussed as follows (see Tables Al. 1- 1.3 for details).'&#13;
6.    Xiangjiang River.  Traffic in the Dayuandu area has been growing steadily&#13;
between 1980 and 1993 (about 4.2 percent per year). The traffic patterns of the river are&#13;
(a) the import of coal (industrial use), oil, steel, fertilizer and general break-bulk cargo;&#13;
and (b) the export of coal (residential use), ores, timber, salt and other local products.&#13;
Due to the industrial expansion of Hengyang city, the growth of the river traffic,&#13;
particularly in 1993-95, is expected to be faster than before (by 9.5 million tons-Mt).&#13;
About 80 percent of the increase is concentrated mainly on three items: salt, coal, iron&#13;
and steel, of which salt alone constitute almost 40 percent of total increases. The increase&#13;
in traffic is due to transportation demand of the upstream city of Hengyang and discussed&#13;
briefly as follows. For the long term (2000-2020), however, traffic is expected to grow&#13;
more steadily (about 3.4 percent per year).&#13;
(a)    Coal. Hengyang is planning to increase the import of higher-quality coal&#13;
from north China to meet the local industrial demand and at the same time&#13;
switch the transportation mode of local produced lower-quality coal from&#13;
truck to vessel, due to the lower transport cost, for downstream residential&#13;
use.&#13;
(b)   Metallic Ores. Expansion of the existing mine's output in Hengyang to&#13;
meet the demand of local and downstream cities is planned.&#13;
Tables are in the Project File.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-115 -                     ANNEX G&#13;
(c)   Iron and Steel. Hengyang Steel Pipe Factory is expanding its output from&#13;
the current 0.15 Mt per year to 0.80 Mt per year. The O/D of the traffic is&#13;
the city of Shanghai.&#13;
(d)   Salt. The phase I development of the salt mine in Hengyang for a chemical&#13;
factory in Zhuzhou is expected to be completed in 1995 and the phase II&#13;
construction is expected to be completed in 2000. It is estimated that the&#13;
replacement of sea salt by rock salt would reduce the total salt costs by&#13;
about Y 160/ton.&#13;
(e)   Others. Some local products in Hengyang such as cement, grain, fertilizer&#13;
and general cargo are also expanding their production.&#13;
7.    Hengyang Port. The port is located along the Xiangjiang river in Hengyang city.&#13;
Commodities to and from the downstream cities have to pass the proposed Dayuandu&#13;
shiplock.  The traffic pattern of the port, therefore, is quite similar to that of the&#13;
Xiangjiang River (para. 6). The traffic during 1993-95 is expected to grow by 9.7 Mt.&#13;
About 77 percent of the growing traffic is concentrated on three items: coal, salt, and&#13;
others, of which salt alone is expected to constitute 52 percent of the total traffic&#13;
increases. The actual annual traffic growth was 3.3 percent between 1980 and 1993. The&#13;
long-term traffic growth (2000-2020) will be 2.8 percent per year.&#13;
8.    Zhuzhou Port. The port is located down stream of the Dayuandu. All upstream&#13;
traffic to Hengyang will have to pass the proposed Dayuandu shiplock. Currently, about&#13;
80 percent of the total port traffic is made up of the importation of construction materials&#13;
(sand and stone). Some items are expected to grow sharply, e.g., (a) the local coal&#13;
washing factory is increasing its import of coal from north China and the washing capacity&#13;
would be increased from 1.8 Mt in 1993 to 2.7 Mt in 2000; (b) the local fertilizer factory&#13;
is planning to purchase phosphorate (nonmetallic ores) from Sichuan province and&#13;
increase in its export production; (c) salt, grain and other general cargo are mainly&#13;
imported from Hengyang port through Dayuandu. Comparing those fast-growth cargoes&#13;
with construction materials, it is still minor in terms of quantity. The basic transport&#13;
pattern of the port, therefore, is not expected to change in the foreseeable future. Both&#13;
the actual traffic growth (1980-93) and long term forecast (2000-20) is and expected to&#13;
remain at about 5.1 percent per year.&#13;
Guangxi&#13;
9.    The Xijiang River is the only major river which flows from west to east cutting&#13;
across the region. Currently, from Guigang to Guangdong and from Xijin to Nanning the&#13;
river could accommodate 1,000-ton ship due to the completion of the two dans (Guigang&#13;
dam in 1989 and Xijin dam in 1964). The only section left is the section between Guigang&#13;
and Xijin, which can only accommodate 120-ton ships. The proposed project will&#13;
eliminate the last bottleneck of the river by constructing a dam at Guigang. The proposed&#13;
dam will raise the water level in this section to accommodate 1,000-ton ships. The project&#13;
also is part of the master plan for improvement of the regional overall interprovincial and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-116 -                      ANNEX G&#13;
intermodal transport system. The goal of this master plan is to transport coal, iron and&#13;
steel, ores (mainly phosphorate), timber, cement, fertilizer and other local products from&#13;
the upstream provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou to the downstream province of&#13;
Guangdong. To achieve this goal, besides the proposed inland waterway project, other&#13;
steps (not financed by the Bank) include: (a) building the new railway line from Kunming&#13;
(capital of Yunnan) to Nanning (capital of Guangxi), via Guizhou. This railway is&#13;
expected to be completed in 1997; (b) constructing a new transshipment center at&#13;
Nanning. The function of this transshipment center would be to receive the incoming dry-&#13;
bulk cargo traffic coming by rail and transferring to 1,000-ton ships to the downstream&#13;
cities. The construction site is tentatively chosen at Nanning area and is expected to be&#13;
completed in 1998; and (c) adding an additional shiplock at Xijin dam. The construction&#13;
would be started in the year 2000. Currently, traffic on the Xijiang River is dominantly&#13;
one way (about 80 percent of total traffic destined to the downstream cities). With the&#13;
project, this ratio is expected to be raised to over 90 percent. The actual traffic growth&#13;
(1980-93) was 9.5 percent per year (from 0.51 Mt to 1.66 Mt). For the long term (2000-&#13;
2020), the growth is expected to be 6.1 percent (from 10.93 Mt to 24.68 Mt; details in&#13;
Table A1.4).&#13;
Zhejiang&#13;
10.   The proposed project in this province covers four channels and three ports that are&#13;
part of the local inland waterway networks. In 1992, these inland waterway networks&#13;
carried 61.2 Mt of cargo (7,104 million t.km) or 37.5 percent of total tonnage transported&#13;
by railway, highway and waterway combined (51.8 percent in t.km). The area does not&#13;
have coal and 50 percent of the imported coal is brought in through the inland waterway&#13;
system via Shanghai. Also, over two thirds of construction materials (sand and stone)&#13;
used by the city of Shanghai are supplied from this area. The traffic pattern can be&#13;
characterized as follows: (a) most cargo's O/D is the city of Shanghai; (b) a few dry-bulk&#13;
cargo items (coal, construction material and nonmetallic ores) constitute over 80 percent&#13;
of total channel traffic; (c) the traffic of the inland waterway system has greatly exceeded&#13;
its designed capacity; and (d) all the major cities, factories and business centers in the area&#13;
can be linked by the local inland waterway networks, i.e., traffic of the channels and of&#13;
these river ports are closely related and should be treated as an integrated transport&#13;
system. Traffic performance and forecast for four channels and three ports are found in&#13;
Tables A 1.5-1.10 and are discussed below:&#13;
11.   The four project channels cut across each other in this area and carry roughly the&#13;
same commodities. Traffic has greatly exceeded the current designed capacity for a long&#13;
time and is summarized as follows:&#13;

Source: ZPCD.&#13;
12.   In this area, the double-track railway line between Hangzhou and Shanghai&#13;
(182 km) was completed in 1994. The railway transport capacity was increased from&#13;
16.0 Mt per year to 25.0 Mt per year and the current railway freight traffic has already&#13;
reached to more than 21.0 Mt per year. It is expected that due to the strong demand of&#13;
the railway services, it will soon reach its designed capacity before the completion of this&#13;
proposed project. One expressway project, financed by the Bank, is under construction&#13;
and the second Bank-financed expressway is in preparation. Since the current waterway&#13;
system has been overloaded for a long time, there is no extra capacity reserved for growth;&#13;
the annual actual growth for four channels, therefore, is very low (under 2 percent per&#13;
year between 1980 and 1993). In recent years, however, due to the strong market&#13;
demand, the growth rate for these channels has been increased in the range of 7 to&#13;
12 percent per year (1990-93) with very severe congestion of the current system. It is&#13;
expected that the traffic growth of the channel, with the project, will soon reach the limits&#13;
of the new design capacity within the first few years. The long-term traffic forecast of&#13;
four channels (2000-20) is, therefore, conservatively determined to be under 2 percent per&#13;
year (Table A1.5).&#13;
13.   Hangzhou Port. The port is operated on the basis of two separated districts&#13;
(Qiantang River district on the south side and Inland Waterway district on north side).&#13;
The two districts are located in different places with different waterway systems and&#13;
linked by one shiplock due to a different water level. The traffic for the shiplock is so&#13;
congested that the port authority is limiting the lock's opening only to certain types of&#13;
ships. The proposed project is to build a new cargo-handling center in the inland&#13;
waterway district. Since the ships cannot move freely between the two districts, the&#13;
economic evaluation has been focused on traffic handled by the inland waterway district.&#13;
The majority of traffic for the new cargo-handling center is expected to be dry-bulk cargo&#13;
(coal and construction materials, over 85 percent of total traffic). This traffic composition&#13;
is also similar to the traffic of the channel system. Although the biggest inland port in&#13;
Zhejiang province, the only dry-bulk handling facility was dismantled in 1985 for safety&#13;
reasons. Without the dry-bulk facility, traffic would shrink by an average of 8.2 percent&#13;
per year. Currently, the inland waterway district handles only about 24 percent of total&#13;
traffic handled by the port authority. With the project, this ratio is expected to be raised&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-118 -                     ANNEX G&#13;
to 65 percent in 2000 and about 70 percent in 2010. The market demand for dry-bulk&#13;
transportation is very strong. With the improvement of conditions at the channels, it is&#13;
expected that the growth of traffic for this district (2000-20) will be 1.8 percent per year&#13;
(Tables Al.6-1.7).&#13;
14.   Huzhou and Jiaxing Transshipment Centers.  These two important local&#13;
transport hubs do not have any regular port authority. The proposed project will help to&#13;
develop the first local port authority to administer and develop the facilities to cater to&#13;
increased demand, particularly, intermodal transshipment among railway, highway and the&#13;
waterways. Today, most of traffic is still handled at the cargo owner's facilities. With the&#13;
project, it is estimated that about 15 to 25 percent of traffic will be shifted to common-&#13;
user berths. The long-term traffic growth (2000-20) is expected to be about 3.5 percent&#13;
per year. Detailed traffic performance and forecast for these ports are found in Tables&#13;
Al.8-1. 10.&#13;
Transport Alternatives&#13;
15.   The excessive traffic demand on inland waterways cannot be diverted to the&#13;
railway because: (a) in Hunan, there is only one railway line (134 km) parallel to the&#13;
Miangjiang waterway (182 km) on the project site. The current annual traffic of the&#13;
railway is over 66.0 Mt while the designed capacity is only 45.0 Mt per year; (b) in&#13;
Guangxi, the west-east waterway traffic flow simply cannot be replaced by the north-&#13;
south aligned railway networks (para. 3); and (c) in Zhejiang, there is only one railway&#13;
line (Hangzhou-Shanghai) in the project area. The growth of traffic may well exceed the&#13;
railway capacity before the completion of the proposed inland waterway project&#13;
(para. 12). Without the railway alternative, the only other possible option for relieving the&#13;
excessive inland waterway traffic is road transport.&#13;
C. COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
16.   For the economic evaluation of the project, all costs necessary for the completion&#13;
of the facilities planned under the project have been taken into account. All inputs and&#13;
outputs have been evaluated in constant 1994 economic costs. Financial costs have been&#13;
converted to economic costs by shadow pricing each component's input categories.&#13;
Conversion factors for each input category are based on estimates determined in&#13;
completed Bank studies. All price contingencies, taxes, duties and interest payments are&#13;
excluded. For traded goods, c.i.f. prices of imports and f.o.b. prices of exports are used in&#13;
estimating the cost of materials and equipment, with adjustments for the cost of inland&#13;
transport. The official exchange rate in November 1994 is used to convert foreign costs&#13;
to Yuan, with adjustment for shadow exchange rate factor of 1.0. (Tables A2.1-2.3).&#13;
17.   The overall conversion factor for Hunan is 0.91, for Guangxi is 0.92 and for&#13;
Zhejiang is 0.88.  The detail calculation of each project component are shown on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-119 -                      ANNEX G&#13;
Tables A2.4-2.9. The factors derived for the various cost items have been applied to the&#13;
annual project expenditures to obtain the stream of project economic costs.&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
18.   Shiplocks and  Channels.   The economic analysis comprises two  steps:&#13;
(a) identification of alternative solutions to meet the projected traffic demand and selection&#13;
of the most cost-effective solution; and (b) comparison of the most cost-effective solution&#13;
against the alternative of doing nothing. In this case it is readily evident that the most&#13;
cost-effective solution is to build the two shiplocks and renovate the four channels: (i) it&#13;
provides a more direct routing for the traffic plus a very large but already sunk investment&#13;
on the phase I construction for the shiplock on Xiangjiang River (Hunan) and Xijiang&#13;
River (Guangxi); and (ii) with four channels in Zhejiang, it provides the cheapest means of&#13;
transport to ship the low-valued dry-bulk cargo for the local people. The next best&#13;
alternative involves construction of new shiplocks or improving channels elsewhere. This&#13;
would require both much greater capital expenditure to cover the phase I construction and&#13;
a more indirect routing with higher operating costs for the majority of the traffic.&#13;
19.   The building of the shiplocks and rehabilitation of the four channels are then&#13;
compared with the "do nothing" option. Doing nothing to improve the two rivers and&#13;
four channels would result in continued under utilization of the rivers and worsen the&#13;
existing traffic congestion of the channels. As the pressure of congestion on those&#13;
transport corridors worsened, without other rivers or channels, the traffic would spill over&#13;
to the much more expensive highway mode (para. 15).&#13;
20.   Simple queuing modeling has been employed to simulate this chain of events in&#13;
order to quantify the order of magnitude of benefits involved. The benefits consist of:&#13;
(a)    unit transport cost savings by using the larger shipments;&#13;
(b)   reduced travel distances for waterborne traffic with the project;&#13;
(c)   elimination of the need to transport via the higher cost mode (via&#13;
highways); and&#13;
(d)   congestion savings resulting from total operating costs savings due to the&#13;
faster transport time.&#13;
21.   The unit economic waterway transport cost for various sizes of shipment and&#13;
Vehicle Operating Costs (VOC) used in the economic evaluation to estimate the benefits&#13;
of the proposed shiplocks and channels are summarized below:&#13;

22.   The cost and benefit stream over time and the resulting economic indicators for&#13;
each project component are summarized in Tables A3.1-3.6.&#13;
23.   Avoiding Traffic Diversion From IWW to Road. In the absence of the project,&#13;
when the IWW traffic reaches the saturation point of full capacity utilization with a high&#13;
level of congestion, any additional traffic is assumed to spill over to road, which is more&#13;
expensive. With the project, such congestion on the river/channel traffic can be avoided,&#13;
resulting in savings by not using the more expensive road traffic mode. Conservatively, it&#13;
is assumed that the trigger point of switchover to road would be when river traffic exceeds&#13;
250 percent of its design capacity (as there is no any other alternative river in the project&#13;
area) and the channel traffic exceeds 300 percent of its design capacity (as there are some&#13;
other alternate channels in the project area). This conservative assumption was made as it&#13;
was not feasible to build a simulation model of traffic buildup and resulting congestion on&#13;
the river/channel routes. It is also estimated, with the project, that only 50 percent of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-121-                       ANNEX G&#13;
traffic can take advantage of larger shipments with the remainder taking five years to&#13;
obtain the benefit of large shipments in the case of transportation on the four channels (as&#13;
this is the first phase of development). Without the project, the traffic condition and flow&#13;
will deteriorate. The congestion savings is calculation on the basis of 5 percent of existing&#13;
transport cost and increased by 2 percent annually.&#13;
24.   Power Stations. Both Hunan and Guangxi are very short of electricity. The&#13;
power company, on average, is forced to shut off the power supply 50 to 100 times every&#13;
day and this shortage occurs the year-round (Tables A4.1-4.2). The long-term and&#13;
persistent shortage of power has seriously limited the economic development of the&#13;
province.  In Hengyang (the project site of Hunan), 74 percent of local power&#13;
consumption has to be imported. In Guigang (the project site of Guangxi), the import&#13;
ratio is 100 percent. The construction of the dam, primary designed to raise the river&#13;
water for the inland waterway system, will also be able to provide very precious electric&#13;
power to the local consumers. For the economic evaluation, the tariff levels covenanted&#13;
under this project are calculated on the basis of 40 fen/kWh.&#13;
25.   Ports. Operational parameter used in the economic evaluation for the analysis of&#13;
the costs and benefit of the proposed port components are given in Tables A5. 1-5.2. The&#13;
economic analysis primarily focused on the benefits derived from relieving congestion in&#13;
the port. Traffic for each project berths are shown in Tables A6. 1-6.2. The project will&#13;
yield quantifiable benefits in the form of savings in cargo-handling costs, ship time (both&#13;
waiting time and operating time), and cargo time (Tables A7. 1-7.6).&#13;
26.   Savings in Cargo-Handling Cost.  Cost savings are expected in the direct&#13;
handling of cargo in the new facilities as compared with the present facilities at the port.&#13;
Without the project, the only way to handle traffic in excess of available berth capacity&#13;
would be through more costly lightening. It is estimated that the lightening costs would&#13;
be three to four times greater than normal handling costs. Detailed estimates of handling&#13;
cost savings are shown in Tables A8.1-8.6 Lightening has been assumed for cargo&#13;
tonnage in excess of berth capacity at 95 percent occupancy, at a cost three times that of&#13;
normal handling. Substantial savings in handling costs are expected after the renovation of&#13;
existing berths, and at the proposed berths. Savings in handling costs have been converted&#13;
to economic benefits by shadow pricing the main cost components of normal handling and&#13;
of lightening. Conversion factors of 1.05 for berth handling and 1.1 for lightening are&#13;
used; these factors were estimated in a previous Bank study.&#13;
27.   Savings in Ship Time. Savings in ship time include both reduction in ship time&#13;
waiting for berths and working at berths due to improved cargo handling. Estimates of&#13;
savings in ship waiting time resulting from the project are shown in Tables A9. 1-9.2. Ship&#13;
costs used for the economic evaluation are at the low end of the ship cost model&#13;
developed by the Bank. The annualized ship resale value, plus operating costs, has been&#13;
used to calculate project benefits. The annual resale value of ships has been assumed to&#13;
reflect the present state of the shipping industry, and gives a slightly lower return than the&#13;
annualized replacement value of ships.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-122 -                      ANNEX G&#13;
28.   Savings in Cargo Time. Savings in ship cargo time also apply to the interest&#13;
saved on the value of the cargo. All cargo are domestic, the marginal source of working&#13;
capital would be loans from the People's Industrial and Commercial Bank of China at&#13;
10 percent interest.  It is assumed that China's marginal cost of capital would be&#13;
approximately 12 percent. Interest savings have been calculated assuming an average rate&#13;
of interest of 10 percent per year.&#13;
29.   The major benefits for the ports' projects would be in loading/unloading and ship&#13;
time savings. These savings would accrue first to shipowners and could be passed on to&#13;
cargo owners. The estimated costs and benefits analysis for each port component are&#13;
shown in Tables AIO. 1-10.6. For the rivers and channels, the major benefits of the project&#13;
would be unit transport cost savings by using large barges and VOC savings on highways.&#13;
These traditional formulations for quantifying economic benefits reflect the minimum&#13;
valuation of benefits. The economic benefits by opening up landlocked portions of Hunan&#13;
and Guangxi, for example, to much larger volumes of river traffic and linking them to&#13;
downstream areas such as Shanghai and Guangdong, China's hottest coastal areas, may&#13;
generate much greater social and economic impacts on the project areas.&#13;
D. OVERALL ECONOMIC EVALUATION AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&#13;

IWW REFORM: FINANCIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL&#13;
ACTION PLAN&#13;
1.    The three provinces of Zhejiang, Hunan and Guangxi have recently made good&#13;
progress in introducing organizational and policy reforms. New corporations and offices&#13;
have been established to implement the proposed project and to operate and manage&#13;
waterways thereafter. Free access has been given to shipping services, cargo allocation&#13;
has been liberalized, freedom has been given to shipping companies for adjusting tariffs&#13;
within a given range of 20 percent, and many shipping companies have been&#13;
commercialized and corporatized.&#13;
2.    Through the proposed project, additional reforms are planned to be introduced. A&#13;
time-bound action plan has been prepared to be followed by the project agencies as&#13;
follows (technical assistance and training is included in the project to help introduce the&#13;
reforms):&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Inland Waterways Project will: (a)
            improve Inland Waterways (IWW) management and introduce
            organizational and financial reforms in line with a market
            economy; (b) expand IWW capacity by widening and deepening
            channels to improve navigation, which requires constructing
            dams to increase the water level; (c) improve connections
            between IWW and land transport services by appropriately
            equipping IWW ports; (d) generate hydroelectric power by
            utilizing the indifferential heads at the dams; and (e)
            enhance the capabilities of the IWW entities. Two of the
            project provinces - Hunan and Guangxi - are relatively poor,
            and project investments are expected to promote economic
            development there by helping to create new jobs, increase
            incomes and reduce poverty. The project's multisectoral
            strategy is consistent with the financial goals of the
            Government's IWW reforms policies, and addresses the
            lack of intersectoral coordination that reduced the IWW
            network in the past.
