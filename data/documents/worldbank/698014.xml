        <abstracts>
            This Note reports the findings from a
            survey of newly privatized, medium-size and large Russian
            firms. The survey showed that many firms are making changes
            and are on the right track; the managers are on the whole
            very good; and the speed of change is about as fast as could
            be expected given the starting point, the lack of capital,
            and the uncertainty in the economic environment. The biggest
            problems facing these firms were delayed payments from
            customers, high taxes, insufficient working capital, weak
            demand and falling orders, inadequate funds for investment,
            and inflation. These problems were interrelated. For the
            future, staying afloat will depend critically on: 1)
            firms' ability to maintain adequate working capital; 2)
            managers' skills in making strategically correct
            choices about products and markets; 3) the degree of freedom
            managers can exercise to downsize in such areas as labor and
            social assets; 4) the speed with which external competition
            strikes; and 5) in the longer term, the availability of
            capital for restructuring. Underpinning all these factors is
            the rate at which the economy stabilizes. Each step deeper
            into recession and each percentage point of inflation
            diminish these firms' chances of survival. But if
            economy stabilizes and capital is available, many firms in
            the survey should do well.
