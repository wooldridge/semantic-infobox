specific context and shall give appropriate deference to the Bank in determining the extent of&#13;
donor visibility.&#13;
Section 7.02. The following exceptions from the General Conditions shall apply:&#13;
(a) To the extent the Bank has followed its applicable policies and procedures in&#13;

within the following areas listed in Annex V: Energy Sector Support under PSG IV, all areas&#13;

the Bank will not be in a position to substantiate that the Commission's funds have been&#13;
specifically allocated to such activities. The Commission further acknowledges that the actual&#13;
allocation of MPF funds shall occur through the MPF governance described in Annex II, such&#13;
that the Bank will not be in a position individually to determine such allocations.&#13;

funds shall be deemed to have been fully utilized if the MPF has disbursed or committed an&#13;
amount equal to or larger than the total amount of the Contribution funds, taking into account&#13;
Section 7.03 above. It is expected that no pro rata share of the Commission under Section&#13;
2.04 above and no unexpended funds to be reimbursed to the Commission under Section&#13;

of Contribution funds and the total of such disbursed or committed amounts (taking into&#13;
account Section 7.03 above) shall be agreed by the Parties for return to the Commission.&#13;

ANNEX II&#13;
Governance Terms of the MPF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿ANNEX II&#13;
Governance&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements&#13;
between the Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
As envisioned by the Somali Compact (as defined in Annex 1), overall governance of the&#13;
Trust Fund shall be provided through the SDRF (as defined in Annex 1), including its&#13;
Steering Committee, which provides coordinated purview over multiple funding vehicles,&#13;
including the Trust Fund. The Donors acknowledge and agree that the intention is for&#13;
development financing for Somalia to increasingly transition towards the SDRF as a preferred&#13;
channel for strategic prioritization and coordination of assistance to Somalia.&#13;
The SDRF Steering Committee governance terms are currently described in the terms of&#13;
reference ("TORs") adopted by the SDRF Steering Committee on December 11, 2013. The&#13;
Parties acknowledge and agree that these TORs are preliminary governance terms that will be&#13;
reviewed and revised over time as part of an ongoing dialogue in Somalia and to enable&#13;
flexible adaptation to changing conditions.&#13;
The governance terms applicable to the Trust Fund shall at all times be those applicable to the&#13;
SDRF, as such terms may be amended or otherwise agreed by the SDRF Steering Committee&#13;
(or its replacement over time), provided that any such governance terms are acceptable to the&#13;
Bank in its role as trustee (the "Governance Terms"). The Parties further acknowledge and&#13;
agree that the Governance Terms, at the time of establishment of the Trust Fund as they may&#13;
be amended through the SDRF over time, shall be applicable to this Administration&#13;
Agreement with effect as of the date agreed within the SDRF without needing additional&#13;
amendments or signatures under this Administration Agreement.&#13;
The Trust Fund is established and shall proceed under the TORs with the following&#13;
expectations of the Parties for future inclusion in or clarification of the Governance Terms:&#13;
1. The Bank shall, in connection with any prior consultations, look to the SDRF as the&#13;
platform for programmatic decision making related to the Trust Fund.&#13;
2. Decision making for the SDRF Steering Committee shall at all times be based on&#13;
consensus. Consensus need not reflect unanimity. A dissenting decision maker that does not&#13;
wish to block a decision may nonetheless state an objection to be recorded in the meeting&#13;
minutes (or by written statement for electronic decision making), in either case clarifying&#13;
whether the statement is for the record only or intended to preclude agreement. The Chair&#13;
articulates the consensus view. Consensus on decisions affecting the Trust Fund must include&#13;
agreement of the Bank.&#13;
3.  Decision making for the SDRF Steering Committee shall at all times be fully&#13;
representative of all Donors to the Trust Fund, whether directly or indirectly. Full Donor&#13;
representation on the SDRF Executive Steering Committee (or its replacement over time)&#13;
shall be indirect, such as through rotational seats under the current TORs. All Donors to&#13;
SDRF funding vehicles, including the Trust Fund, shall decide amongst themselves how to&#13;
allocate such seats and constituency representation to ensure full donor representation.&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿4. Fair and transparent processes shall be used for the selection of civil society and regional&#13;
representatives and the determination of constituency relationships. Membership matters&#13;
shall at all times be subject to oversight by the SDRF Plenary Steering Committee (or its&#13;
replacement over time).&#13;
5. Implementation under the Trust Fund shall at all times be in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
Articles of Agreement, policies and procedures ("Operating Terms"). This includes the&#13;
requirement that any grants provided under the Trust Fund shall have received prior consent&#13;
from the Federal Government of Somalia ("FGS"), including potential framework approaches&#13;
agreed with the FGS to enable regional balance. Common monitoring, reporting, risk&#13;
management or other standards, formats or requirements may be agreed within the SDRF&#13;
with applicability to the Trust Fund, provided that the Bank shall have expressly agreed to&#13;
such terms. In the event of conflict between the Bank's Operating Terms and any terms made&#13;
applicable to the Trust Fund through the SDRF, the Bank's Operating Terms shall prevail.&#13;
6. A results framework and a risk framework for the Trust Fund will both be developed in the&#13;
context of the SDRF Operations Manual, as well as SDRF procedures for identifying and&#13;
processing projects, all of which may be reviewed and revised over time by the SDRF&#13;
Steering Committee and shall neither augment the rights or obligations in the Administration&#13;
Agreement nor otherwise have legal effect, but they will be used to enable meaningful&#13;
progress reporting and evaluations. Progress reporting under the Administration Agreement&#13;
will reflect the SDRF-agreed results framework.&#13;
7. The Aid Coordination Unit ("ACU") housing the Secretariat of the SDRF shall be&#13;
sponsored by the FGS for purposes of providing support to the governing bodies of the SDRF&#13;
without becoming involved in project implementation or Trustee functions under the Trust&#13;
Fund. Support provided by the Bank to the ACU shall at all times be mindful of the&#13;
distinction between the ACU's role relative to the Bank's fiduciary and supervisory role&#13;
under its applicable policies and procedures.&#13;
8. It is understood that donors may at their initiative and in their discretion decide to convene&#13;
as a group apart from the SDRF.   Such separate convenings are expected to enable&#13;
coordination that supports the SDRF.&#13;
9. Any oversight functions of the SDRF shall not include oversight of the Trustee and Trust&#13;
Fund operations, which shall remain at all times under Bank oversight.&#13;
10. Any dispute resolution mechanism developed for the SDRF shall not affect the Bank's&#13;
operation of the Trust Fund or create any liability for the Trustee.&#13;
The Parties recognize that the above expectations are not fully articulated, agreed or operative&#13;
as part of the governance of the SDRF, which includes government and other participants. It&#13;
is understood that failure on the part of the SDRF to reach consensus along the lines of the&#13;
above expectations may be grounds for the Trustee to adjust its participation in the Trust&#13;
Fund and the SDRF.&#13;
For clarity, the Somali Compact serves as a backdrop for the SDRF and by extension the&#13;
Trust Fund without having direct legal effect on this Administration Agreement. In the event&#13;
of conflict between this Administration Agreement and the Somali Compact, or any other&#13;
document relating to the SDRF, this Administration Agreement shall prevail.&#13;

entity shall return such cancelled balance to the Commission including any investment&#13;

for in Section 12.02, the Commission may suspend payments or (exceptionally) the eligibility&#13;

Indicative Budget for the MPF&#13;

ï»¿ANNEX V&#13;
Indicative Bud2et for the MPF&#13;
The Parties agree that the inclusion of this indicative budget is for informational purposes&#13;
only and shall have no legal or binding effect, including for purposes of verifications and&#13;
audits or otherwise in relation to determining ineligible expenditures. The Commission&#13;
acknowledges the high level of uncertainty surrounding this indicative budget, reflecting inter&#13;
alia uncertainty regarding total contributions from prospective donors, as well as uncertainty&#13;
regarding the exact composition of MPF expenses and activities given the reliance on the&#13;
SDRF for project approval, as well as the high degree of country volatility and the fluidity of&#13;
the operating environment. Given that the MPF will have a ten-year lifespan, this indicative&#13;
budget represents near-term estimates only, covering a timeframe of donor contributions of&#13;
one- to three-years from the activation of the MPF and is expected to change over time.&#13;
