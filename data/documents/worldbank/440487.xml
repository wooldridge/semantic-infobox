Abstract&#13;
This volume brings together four studies of how firms adjusted to the recent&#13;
reforms in Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina. The authors carried out interviews&#13;
with managers in manufacturing and agricultural exporting firms that elicited&#13;
reactions about the favorable and unfavorable shocks caused by the reforms,&#13;
the credibility and consistency of the reform packages, and the major&#13;
adjustments in the firms' operations. The findings show that firms benefited&#13;
from the removal of price controls, restrictive labor laws, and laws&#13;
restricting the purchase of foreign know-how. But they were hurt by the&#13;
pronounced real exchange rate appreciation and high real interest rates for&#13;
peso borrowing toward the end of the reforms. In Argentina and Uruguay policy&#13;
reversals often delayed adjustments in the operation of firms. Nonetheless,&#13;
almost all managers reported that the reforms forced them to increase their&#13;
operating efficiency because of greater import competition. In Chile, where&#13;
liberalization was more widespread and where there was less doubt about&#13;
reversibility, adjustments were the greatest. Productivity increases there&#13;
were mostly achieved by reducing product variety and dismissing labor. In&#13;
Uruguay, greater investment played a major role. In Argentina, mergers and&#13;
changes in activity from production toward importing or from wholesaling&#13;
toward retailing were often important. In all three countriets, improvements&#13;
in product quality were frequent.&#13;

Preface&#13;
An increasing number of developing and newly industrialized countries have&#13;
been in the process or are considering implementing adjustment programs with a&#13;
view toward improving resource allocation and recovering growth. In many of&#13;
these countries the reforms have involved the elimiination of price&#13;
distortions, the reduction of protection for import-competing activities, and&#13;
the lowering of taxation of export activities. It is clear that in a present&#13;
value sense the benefits from these types of reforms have been much higher&#13;
than the costs. However, as the costs have to be paid up front, there has&#13;
usually been a reluctance to implement these policies.&#13;
The purpose of the research reported in this volume is to study the&#13;
adjustment by firms during the implementation of liberalization attempts. The&#13;
research draws on the bold economic reform packages in Chile, Uruguay, and&#13;
Argentina. Launched in the mid-seventies, the reforms aimed to achieve lower&#13;
inflation and higher growth on a permanent basis. Micro-oriented reforms&#13;
spanned commodity, labor, and financial markets. The breadth of the reform&#13;
packages was unique and offers a rare opportunity to study how adjustment to a&#13;
new set of incentives took place. An objective of the research reported in&#13;
this volume was to identify those measures that facilitated adjustment and&#13;
those factors that delayed adjustment or render(ed it more difficult.&#13;
This volume brings together the results from four studies of how&#13;
firms adjusted to the reforms in the three countries. The work is part of a&#13;
larger research project, "Liberalization with Stabilization in the Southern&#13;
Cone," and the studies should be viewed as an integral part of that&#13;
research. Yet each chapter in this volume is also self-contained. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
chapters complement other studies in the project by focusing on (1) how the&#13;
reforms affected the system of incentives and resource allocation in&#13;
manufacturing and (2) what steps firms took to adjust to the new system of&#13;
incentives.&#13;
With respect to the system of incentives, the studies synthesize and&#13;
provide new evidence on the outcome of the reduction in foreign trade&#13;
restrictions during the reforms. For example, it is shown on the basis of&#13;
detailed price comparisons that redundant protection remained in Argentina and&#13;
Uruguay late into the reforms and that the removal of protection to import-&#13;
competing firms was mostly achieved by real exchange rate appreciation due to&#13;
anti-inflationary policy -- not by reductions in foreign trade restrictions.&#13;
By contrast, in Chile trade liberalization took place more gradually over&#13;
several years. As for firms' adjustments to the new incentive structure, a&#13;
number of interesting findings emerge. For instance, as a result of the&#13;
interviews, the authors conclude that improvements in product quality and a&#13;
narrowing down of product varieties were important forms of adjustment in the&#13;
operation of firms. Moreover, the lifting of restrictions on the purchase of&#13;
foreign know-how was perceived by managers as among the favorable changes and&#13;
hence helpful aspects of the reforms. This information would have been&#13;
difficult to obtain without the interviews. Similarly, with the help of the&#13;
interviews, the authors were also able to judge the changes in product mix.&#13;
The authors conducted interviews with managers in charge of decision-&#13;
making during the reforms. For each study only a dozen firms were&#13;
interviewed. Thus, representativeness is limited, although each author&#13;
selected import-competing and exporting firms in his sample, and the same&#13;
structured questionnaire was used in each study. Much greater&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
representativeness of how the financial performance (leverage, profitability,&#13;
real financial costs, and dollar exposure) of firms evolved during the reforms&#13;
is available from individual country studies involving a large sample of&#13;
firms. The studies, which are also part of this research, appear in part II&#13;
of the August 1985 issue of World Development, which is on the symposium,&#13;
"Liberalization with Stabilization in the Southern Cone."&#13;
In addition to interpreting how firm managers perceived the reforms&#13;
and how their perception of credibility affected their decisions, each study&#13;
gives a condensed description of the macroeconomic environment for firms&#13;
during the reforms. The studies thus give a self-contained assessment of the&#13;
adjustment to each reform package, an approach that enables the reader to&#13;
trace differences in the pattern of adjustment across countries to the&#13;
intensity of the reforms and to the evolution of the economy. (A more&#13;
detailed analytical interpretation of the macroeconomic adjustment in each&#13;
country is provided in part I of the August 1985 issue of World Development on&#13;
the symposium.)&#13;

The purpose of market liberalization in highly distorted economies is to&#13;
improve existing resource allocation across sectors, across firms in a sector,&#13;
and within firms in a sector. In a dynamic sense, liberalization is also&#13;
intended to improve the efficiency of investment by allocating it to&#13;
activities that are profitable under incentives free of distortions.&#13;
Restrictions in highly regulated economies tend in mlany ways to make&#13;
manufacturing firms less than efficient, as they are restricted in the choice&#13;
of their optimum output and input mix. To begin with, these firms are&#13;
constrained in their input markets. Adjustments in their work forces are&#13;
impeded by labor legislation. Management of inventories is complicated by&#13;
uncertainty about whether and when the firms will be able to import spare&#13;
parts and raw materials. Nor are enterprises sure about how much capital they&#13;
will have access to -- and at what cost. Firms in such economies also operate&#13;
in restricted product markets. There are barriers to the entry of foreign&#13;
companies. There also are barriers to the entry of new domestic firms, for&#13;
even if the cost of entry is not a problem, access to capitaL may be --&#13;
because the limited pool of capital is parceled out according to long-standing&#13;
ties between existing producers and their creditors. Barriers to entry, of&#13;
course, benefit existing firms as they have more leeway in their pricing&#13;
policies. The firms thus suffer from some of the restrictions and benefit&#13;
from others.&#13;
This volume is part of research in progress at the World Banlk under RPO 672-&#13;
85, "Liberalization with Stabilization in the Southern Cone."  We would like&#13;
to thank the managers of the firms we interviewed for the time they accorded&#13;
us so generously. Without their cooperation this research would not have been&#13;
possible. We also thank Bruce Ross-Larson, who made major improvements in all&#13;
the chapters in this volume, James Tybout for his comments, (nd Gabriel&#13;
Castillo and Whitney Watriss for their assistance.&#13;

Restrictions in highly regulated economies include made-to-measure&#13;
protection. This situation guarantees the coexistence of firms with a wide&#13;
dispersion of efficiency within a sector, since the level of protection is&#13;
chosen to make the least efficient firms profitable. As a result, many firms&#13;
can operate at a profit with dated machinery and equipment.&#13;
In such economies, most firms are inefficient. They use outmoded&#13;
technology and use it badly (technical inefficiency). Too many of them&#13;
operate at too small a scale (scale inefficiency). They do not equate&#13;
marginal products with factor costs (allocative inefficiency). And they price&#13;
their products above the marginal cost of production (price inefficiency).&#13;
Because consumers have nowhere else to go, the leading firms can charge higher&#13;
than normal mark-ups, with other firms following suiL. This situation&#13;
contributes to the coexistence of firms with a wide range of technical&#13;
efficiency. Under such conditions the economy becomes characterized by idle&#13;
capacity and unproductive work forces. In addition, the incentive system is&#13;
greatly distorted because protection has been tailored for individual products&#13;
to ensure the survival of firms already operating. The made-to-measure&#13;
protection mentioned above usually includes quantitative restrictions that&#13;
result in exceedingly large rents and induce economic agents to expend much of&#13;
their effort appropriating rents rather than engaging in activities that would&#13;
be more socially productive. Thus, resources are badLy allocated and&#13;
underused, and the resulting market structures are not: competitive.&#13;
The purpose of liberalization is to reach a new long-run equilibrium&#13;
in which existing resources and investment are better allocated and better&#13;
used.  The incentives to production -- whether for domestic markets or foreign&#13;
markets, whether for capital goods, intermediate goods, or consumer goods --&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
become considerably more neutral. The incentives also become far more&#13;
consistent -- no longer subject to erratic changes. With less uncertainty and&#13;
a longer horizon, the planning for resource allocation is much easier and the&#13;
cost of making mistakes is reduced. In this environment, firms devote much&#13;
more effort to improving their operations -- to improving quality, to&#13;
embarking on new product lines, to keeping costs down. Agents also have more&#13;
incentives to engage in activities that are more socially productive.&#13;
The essays in this volume are concerned with how managers judged the&#13;
consistency and sustainability of the reforms in the Southern Cone and how&#13;
firms change their operations when reforms alter drastically the incentives&#13;
they face.  Lessons from the essays in this volume are summarized at the end&#13;
of the chapter.&#13;
1. Problems of Liberalization&#13;
Liberalizing an economy is less than straightforward for the economic&#13;
policy maker, for the problems of implementation vary greatly depending on the&#13;
initial conditions. How long have the policies leading to distortions been in&#13;
force? For three or four years? Or for thirty or forty? And how great are&#13;
the distortions? Added to the size of the problem is the credibility of the&#13;
reforms. If the actors in the economy are to respond in the way envisaged by&#13;
the reforms, they must believe that the reforms are permanent rather than&#13;
temporary. An important part of instilling this belief is establishing&#13;
consensus about the desirability and consistency of the reform package. Given&#13;
these requirements, the policy maker must make decisions about the speed of&#13;
implementing the reforms, the order of undertaking individual measures, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
consistency of the whole reform package, and the breadth of activity to which&#13;
individual reforms will apply.&#13;
The speed of reforms, their consistency, and the expectations about&#13;
their sustainability greatly influence their success. If the reforms are&#13;
immediate and complete, the actors might take them seriously. At the same&#13;
time, should the short-term adjustment costs be too high, the result could be&#13;
chaos. Or the actors could judge that the reforms are not sustainable and&#13;
hence postpone adjusting.  If the reforms are implemented in a progression of&#13;
pre-announced small steps, the short-term adjustment costs to the economy&#13;
could be moderated and the credibility of the measures enhanced. But the risk&#13;
is that the actors might not take the reforms seriously and simply await a&#13;
reversal of policy or change in government. Intertwined with the&#13;
practicalities of the speed of the reforms are those of their order. Economic&#13;
sense would dictate that, for consistency with the change in incentives toward&#13;
exportable sectors, the current account be liberalized before the capital&#13;
account -- or that, to facilitate adjustment, labor markets be liberalized&#13;
before product markets. But political requirements might lead to opposite&#13;
sequences. The third practicality is the breadth of the reforms. What&#13;
markets are to be affected? What firms? What products? The answers return&#13;
the policy maker to questions of sequencing and, in turn, to questions of&#13;
speed. The policy maker also has to face failures and unexpected results. If&#13;
something does not work or if one part of the reform package is decidedly&#13;
inconsistent with another part, the policy maker might choose to retreat from&#13;
a measure, allowing pragmatism to prevail. But such retreats could undermine&#13;
the perceived permanence of the entire reform package, and the outcome depends&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
on the expectations of the actors in the economy. The importance of each of&#13;
these issues is brought out in the chapters in this volume.&#13;
2. Liberalizing the Economies of the Southern Cone 1/&#13;
For decades, Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina pursuecl a development&#13;
strategy of import-substitution industrialization supported by extensive&#13;
government intervention across markets. The set of incentives that emerged&#13;
discriminated heavily against exports. Beginning in the mid-1970s, these&#13;
countries suddenly switched from import-substitution-led industrializatiorl to&#13;
a reduction of the anti-export bias, greater reliance on market allocation of&#13;
resources, and greater openness to trade and capital flows. On the eve of&#13;
these reforms, all three countries were facing extreme macroeconomic&#13;
imbalance, a situation which meant that the liberalization was carried out&#13;
against the backdrop of major stabilization efforts.&#13;
In each country the goal was to reduce government intervention in the&#13;
economy and to increase the role of market forces and private firms.  This&#13;
goal was to be achieved by eliminating quantitative restrictions to trade and&#13;
by lowering the tariff barriers and opening the doors to international trade&#13;
and capital flows. And it was to be achieved by freeing prices -- of labor,&#13;
capital, and key commodities -- and by generally freeing the! economies of many&#13;
governmental constraints. For example, a number of public enterprises were to&#13;
be returned to private hands.&#13;
Because of the unusually high rates of inflation, the reform packages&#13;
included a combination of stabilization and liberalization policies. The&#13;
stabilization policies were primarily aimed at bringing doWn to international&#13;
levels the four-digit rate of inflation in Chile and Argent:ina and the three-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
digit rate of inflation in Uruguay. The reforms started around 1974 in&#13;
Uruguay and in Chile, and 1976-77 in Argentina. The liberalization policies&#13;
consisted of removing controls and regulations in factor, commodity, and&#13;
foreign exchange markets. Two kinds of reforms were implemented in the&#13;
product markets: deregulation of the domestic market and reduction of tariff&#13;
and nontariff barriers.&#13;
Product Markets&#13;
In the early stages of implementation in Chile, prices in the&#13;
domestic commodity market were deregulated, and subsidies were practically&#13;
eliminated. Indirect deregulation of the commodity market was also achieved&#13;
by the privatizing of many enterprises in government hands. All nontariff&#13;
barriers were eliminated around 1974. Over the five years starting in 1974,&#13;
the average tariff was brought down from 90 percent to 10 percent (except for&#13;
automobiles over 850cc). After a real devaluation of close to 25 percent in&#13;
1975, the exchange rate was periodically adjusted, with the commercial policy&#13;
reforms, evolution of the current account, and difference between domestic and&#13;
foreign inflation all taken into account. By 1976 the multiple exchange rate&#13;
system of the Allende years had been replaced by a unified exchange rate. As&#13;
a result, effective protection for manufacturing was brought down from an&#13;
average of 150 percent in 1974 to 13 percent by 1979.&#13;
Overall, Chile went the furthest toward liberalizing the economy,&#13;
mainly because of the pervasiveness of its commoclity market deregulation and&#13;
the return of many enterprises to private hands. The interviews suggest that&#13;
the credibility of the reform of dismantling trade restrictions was high among&#13;
Chilean entrepreneurs, though some complained when authorities decided to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
lower tariffs to a 10 percent uniform level instead of the 35 percent level&#13;
announced initially.&#13;
In Argentina, public enterprises were not privatized, and the&#13;
military stated that the reforms should avoid creating unemployment and social&#13;
unrest. Price controls were part of the stabilization effort in 1977 but&#13;
abandoned thereafter, with remaining controls stemming mainly from the setting&#13;
of tariff rates of public enterprises. Despite a move away from multiple&#13;
exchange rates and some reduction in tariffs and taxes on traditional exports,&#13;
significant tariff and nontariff barriers remained for intermediate and&#13;
capital goods. As a result, the import surge during 1979-80 (while the&#13;
exchange rate was allowed to appreciate in an effort to break inflationary&#13;
expectations) was mostly in consumer goods. That surge reflected the real&#13;
exchange rate appreciation rather than the reduction in protection. Indeed,&#13;
average nominal protection for manufacturing was still 40 percent in 1977.&#13;
The lack of credibility in Argentina was pervasive and can be traced&#13;
to a history of unsuccessful liberalization attempts. During the reforms,&#13;
there was the aborted price truce in 1977 and the breaking of the schedule of&#13;
announced tariff reductions to fight inflation. Both actions reduced the&#13;
credibility of the tariff reform. So did the widening fiscal deficit after&#13;
the adoption of the pre-announced rate of devaluation. Not surprisingly,&#13;
managers often postponed making adjustments in their firms' operations.&#13;
Eleven of the twelve firms interviewed waited between three and twenty months&#13;
before starting to adjust. One firm, anticipating a policy change, even kept&#13;
"idle" workers to minimize the costs associated with layoffs and rehiring.&#13;
In Uruguay, price controls were nearly eliminated by the end of&#13;
1979. In addition, by 1977 the maximum tariff was cut from 150 percent to 90&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10 -&#13;
percent, and tariffs for noncompetitive imports were dropped to 35 percent.&#13;
And in December 1978 a tariff reduction program was announced establishing a&#13;
uniform tariff of 35 percent as the target for 1985, to be carried out with&#13;
linear tariff reductions. As in Argentina, an appreciating exchange rate was&#13;
the main cause of increasing external competition. 2/ But because of the&#13;
extensive use of reference prices for tariff assessment, the impact of the&#13;
tariff reforms was limited. Nevertheless, the bias against exports was&#13;
reduced by export and financial subsidies. In 1981, real effective protection&#13;
for domestic sales was 75 percent while protection ior export sales was only&#13;
30 percent. Thus a 35 percent bias against export sales remained.&#13;
The credibility of the reforms in Uruguay changed sharply in 1979.&#13;
According to the interviews, it was high during 1974-78, when investment,&#13;
exports, and growth rose dramatically. But credibility waned in 1979, first&#13;
because of the strong currency appreciation in Argentina, later because&#13;
Argentina started to devalue in real terms in 1981, while the Uruguayan&#13;
currency was appreciating substantially with respect to the Argentine peso.&#13;
Interestingly, in mid-1982, when no departures Erom announced policies had yet&#13;
taken place, 35 percent of 289 interviewees responded that in 1979 they did&#13;
not expect that the tariff reform would proceed as pLanned. By 1982, after&#13;
the Argentine collapse, only 10 percent expected that the reform would&#13;
continue.&#13;
Financial Markets&#13;
Deregulating the financial markets was also a common feature of&#13;
reforms in the three countries. This deregulation was important because these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
countries had for many years relied heavily on nonprice al]ocations of credit,&#13;
accompanied by highly negative real interest rates.&#13;
In all three countries, domestic capital markets were substantially&#13;
deregulated in two ways. First, interest rate ceilings were progressively&#13;
eliminated. Second, restrictions on financial intermediaries were reduced.&#13;
In addition, attempts were made to open the economy to international capital&#13;
flows. In this regard, Uruguay went the farthest: private capital&#13;
transactions were legally recognized as early as 1974, and full convertibility&#13;
was introduced in October 1978. In Argentina, controls on capital movements&#13;
were eliminated with the reforms of 1979. In Chile, restrictions on medium-&#13;
term capital flows were lifted by April 1980 but remained f-or inflows of less&#13;
than two-year maturity.&#13;
No doubts were expressed during the interviews about the credibility&#13;
of financial market deregulation. But the financial reforms led the&#13;
entrepreneurs interviewed to devote more time to financial management. As the&#13;
cost of working capital denominated in pesos eventually soared in all three&#13;
countries, managers spent more time on improving inventory management&#13;
controls. During the pre-announced exchange rate policy, the spreads between&#13;
the cost of peso loans and dollar loans increased substantially following a&#13;
drop in the cost of the latter. During this period managers turned from&#13;
production management to financial arbitrage to make short-run profits by&#13;
borrowing dollar-denominated funds and lending them in pesos. Such arbitrage&#13;
was not an intent of the reforms and certainly detracted from the long-run&#13;
objective of rationalizing production within firms. As expLained in the&#13;
country papers in the volume, later on, when doubts about the sustainability&#13;
of the exchange rate policy set in, the interest rate spreads between pesos&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
and dollars soared. By this time the portfolio composition of firms was often&#13;
difficult to adjust and extremely vulnerable to a devaluation. 3/&#13;
Labor Markets&#13;
Labor markets were liberalized less than the others. In all three&#13;
countries they remained controlled through large severance payments, wage&#13;
adjustment policies based on legislation, and, in some cases, wage&#13;
indexation. In Argentina, labor mobility was hampered by requirements for&#13;
large severance payments. In Chile, mobility was increased by the new labor&#13;
laws of late 1979 and the social security reform of May 1981, but full wage&#13;
indexation remained throughout. In Uruguay, labor mobility was increased with&#13;
the social security reform of 1979, which created a unified social security&#13;
fund financed mainly by government revenue from general taxes.  But despite&#13;
the cessation of labor union activity during the reforms, those interviewed&#13;
gave the impression that, overall, managers felt it was difficult to adjust&#13;
their work forces. Such adjustments appear hard and costly to managers under&#13;
any circumstances, but it seems they were especially difficult to carry out in&#13;
the Southern Cone. Perhaps the reason was a lack of sufficient new activities&#13;
to absorb the redundant labor in existing firms.&#13;
3. Adjustments by Firms to the Reforms&#13;
In all three countries, reforms started1 at a time of crisis and with&#13;
a heavily distorted market. Initial conditions thus were far from what the&#13;
reforms targeted -- interest rate and price controls had been in place for&#13;
decades, and the bias against export activities had been growing ever since&#13;
the import-substitution policies were started in the 1930s. Given these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
initial conditions, and previously unsuccessful mild attempts at&#13;
liberalization, the authorities must have faced deeply entrenchqed political&#13;
interest groups and recalcitrant expectations. Some of the interviewees gave&#13;
concrete examples of attempts at thwarting the reforms.&#13;
Losers will always try to defend the status quo. The papers in this&#13;
volume suggest that when the credibility of reforms is low, such behavior will&#13;
intensify. A comparison of the experiences in the three countries shows that&#13;
adjustments started soon after the announcements in Chile (where credibility&#13;
was high), whereas there were more delays and stronger resistance in Argentina&#13;
and Uruguay. Moreover, policy changes and reversals were often cited as&#13;
causes of the low credibility. Thus the costs of creating uncertainty by&#13;
contradictory statements appear to be high, as resistance to change is&#13;
intensified and desired adjustments are postponed.&#13;
Below we summarize how firms adjusted to the reforms. In some cases&#13;
the results were expected, in some cases unexpected, and we distinguish&#13;
between the two. By expected adjustments we mean those consistent with the&#13;
intent of the reforms. By unexpected adjustments we mean either adjustments&#13;
that went against the intent of the reforms (e.g. the survival of a firm not&#13;
competitive in the products it manufactures) or ones we found suirprising.&#13;
Expected Firm Adjustments&#13;
The interviews revealed that before the reforms, the pricing&#13;
decisions of firms were guided mainly by estimates of their cost:s of&#13;
production, not by competitors' prices. A mark-up pricing rule seemed to&#13;
prevail. But as the effects of the reforms intensified, pricin,g decisions&#13;
became guided by competitors' prices. (One interviewee in Uruguiay told us&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14 -&#13;
that the reforms led to the breakdown of a "gentlemen's agreement" among&#13;
competing firms.) A good example of the effect of the reforms on pricing is a&#13;
Chilean footwear producer who said that his client indicated to him that he&#13;
had to match the price and quality of the imported good, The need to face&#13;
import competition thus led firms not only to change their pricing rule but&#13;
also to make adjustments in their operations that included improvement in&#13;
product quality, narrowing of the product range, mergers, and plant shutdowns.&#13;
The adjustment cited most often was improvement in product quality.&#13;
In all three countries, interviewees ranked this adjustment at the top.&#13;
Interestingly, most managers admitted that product quality had not concerned&#13;
them before the reforms, a comment that suggests an environment with little&#13;
competition. It is hard to judge the extent of quality improvement, but it&#13;
must have been pervasive given the weight attached by managers.&#13;
Another related adjustment often mentioned in Argentina and Uruguay&#13;
was the introduction by import-competing firms of new products to meet foreign&#13;
competition (with one exception). Again, the new products were of better&#13;
quality. An example is a clothing producer in Argentina who reacted to&#13;
foreign competition by imitating American and European clothing styles and by&#13;
introducing sports fashions. Another example, again in Argentina, is a soap&#13;
producer who previously marketed only undifferentiated soap but successfully&#13;
introduced a high-quality brand-name soap. Clearly, improvement in product&#13;
quality and the introduction of new products are hard to distinguish from one&#13;
another.  Taken together, however, they were the most: important form of&#13;
adjustment among import-competing firms. Inasmuch as we interviewed surviving&#13;
firms, we may conclude that successful adjusters in the import-competing group&#13;
have to improve product quality and/or introduce new products to compete with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
imported products that enter the market as a result of the liberalization.&#13;
(How this shift was done rapidly through the introduction of foreign&#13;
blueprints and know-how is discussed below.)&#13;
In Chile, where the deregulation of commodity markets went furthest,&#13;
managers of import-competing firms reduced production lines to those in which&#13;
they felt the firm could compete with imports. Thus greater specialization&#13;
can be expected when firms have to cut costs drastically. Moreover, fewer&#13;
product brands result in less machine downtime because the length of runs&#13;
increases; thus production costs are reduced. In neither Argerntina in&#13;
particular, nor also in Uruguay, was reduction in product lines cited among&#13;
the important forms of adjustment.  This result is not surprising in view of&#13;
the fact that redundant protection remained late into the reform period in&#13;
both countries.&#13;
As interest rates for peso-denominated borrowing eventually soared to&#13;
high positive levels, reduction in the length of time inventories were held as&#13;
well as reductions in the volume of inventories held (sometimes to&#13;
"dangerously" low levels) took place everywhere. Managers also attempted&#13;
whenever they could to reduce consumer credit financing.&#13;
Three kinds of adjustments allowed the surviving import-competing&#13;
firms to adjust in time their product/quality mix to the rapidly growing&#13;
foreign competition: (1) reductions in the labor force; (2) increased&#13;
investment; and (3) import of blueprints and negotiation of profit-sharing&#13;
agreements with foreign firms.&#13;
Reduction in the labor force was most pronounced in Chile, where nine&#13;
out of ten firms interviewed cut their labor force from 20-50 percent, and one&#13;
firm with seasonal production replaced half its permanent persorLnel with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
seasonal workers. In Chile reductions in the labor force were often&#13;
accompanied by plant shutdowns and consolidations. For example, the&#13;
electrical appliance producer was able to reduce accounting and engineering&#13;
staff drastically by consolidating several plants. Managers often expressed&#13;
surprise at how much productivity improvement they were able to accomplish. A&#13;
consumer durable producer was able to achieve a seven-fold increase in&#13;
productivity per worker with minimal investments. And c textile manufacturer,&#13;
with the help of investments, increased cloth output from 1,000 meters per&#13;
month to 28,000 meters per month. In all three countries, years of job&#13;
protection provided by the combination of a sheltered environment and labor&#13;
union activity had led to much redundant employment in manufacturing.&#13;
Investment in new machinery and for necessary plant modernization to&#13;
upgrade product quality or introduce new products was often mentioned.  In&#13;
Uruguay, where investment had been low for many years because of import&#13;
controls on capital equipment, replacement of old machinery occurred&#13;
frequently. In Chile, six out of ten firms made major investments, while in&#13;
Argentina four out of nine managers judged that increases in investment helped&#13;
them a great deal in adjusting.&#13;
Besides investments in new machinery and equipment, purchases of&#13;
foreign blueprints and licensing agreements with foreign firms enabled several&#13;
import-competing producers to adjust rapidly. Prior to the reforms the&#13;
combination of the lack of competition and bureaucratic difficulties in&#13;
obtaining permits and licenses for importing foreign technology had often led&#13;
to the use of dated technology. But many interviewees expressed that they&#13;
were able to acquire and master rapidly new blueprints and technologies to&#13;
meet foreign competition. For example, a ceramic-and-steel fixtures producer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
in Argentina was able to improve product quality by purchasing blueprints from&#13;
European firms. In some cases, firms entered a profit-sharing agreement with&#13;
a foreign firm to manufacture a foreign product under their own (domestic)&#13;
brand name. Thus it would appear that the necessary catching up was achieved&#13;
rapidly among the successful import-competing adjusters.&#13;
Unexpected Adjustments&#13;
We begin with those adjustments that were not intended by the&#13;
reforms. On the financial side, the opportunity to borrow at much lower rates&#13;
in dollars led to interesting portfolio decisions. In some cases -- mostly&#13;
among the multinationals in the three countries -- domestic borrowing often&#13;
remained the preferred source of credit. But the studies in the volume show&#13;
that in Argentina and Uruguay some firms managed to offset deteriorating&#13;
margin performances with a shift toward dollar borrowing at highly negative&#13;
real interest rates. A case in point is a textile producer in Argentina who&#13;
managed to offset plummeting operating margins with negative financial costs&#13;
through access to funds at subsidized rates. Some managers even reported that&#13;
they made a handsome profit by intermediating dollar loans into peso-&#13;
denominated loans. Given that much of the privately held dollar debt was&#13;
socialized in all three countries after the abandonment of the tablita and&#13;
that differences in financial costs paid by firms were often the most&#13;
important determinant of overall profitability, one must question whether&#13;
adjustments to the new financial environment impeded the desired resource&#13;
shifts intended by the reforms in the commodity markets, or at least often&#13;
overshadowed adjustments to reforms in these markets.4/ This pattern appears&#13;
to have occurred frequently in Argentina and Uruguay, where assumption by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
central bank of nonperforming dollar loans rewarded the risky financial&#13;
behavior of firms.  This unintended form of adjustment thus allowed some&#13;
nonviable firms to remain in business by offsetting poor performance in gross&#13;
earnings with financial profits resulting from risky financial structures.&#13;
It deserves emphasis that much misplaced investment was reported&#13;
among the interviewees because of the effects of the strong real exchange rate&#13;
appreciation. In all three countries there are several examples of firms that&#13;
invested in new equipment for production for the export market but that could&#13;
never complete their investment plans. The reason is that the real exchange&#13;
rate appreciation led them to lose competitiveness, and they had either to&#13;
abandon their investment in mid-course or shut down.&#13;
There were also instances of irreversible costs incurred by exporters&#13;
who invested heavily in advertising to penetrate export markets that they had&#13;
had to abandon mid-stream. A case in point is a Chilean copperware producer&#13;
who invested $300,000 in advertising to penetrate foreign markets. After some&#13;
inroads he had to abandon the markets because the real exchange rate&#13;
appreciation had made his export venture unprofitable. Moreover, and for the&#13;
same reason, his import-competing activities were also becoming unprofitable.&#13;
The unintended adjustments described above went against the goal of&#13;
efficient resource allocation. Other unintended adjustments, although they&#13;
did not go directly against efficient resource use, may have slowed&#13;
adjustment. In particular, many import-competing firms started importing&#13;
products similar to those they produced, sometimes ceasing production&#13;
altogether.  Reasons for this behavior ranged from "to maximize use of our&#13;
distribution network" to "so that other firms won't do so."  Shifting from1f&#13;
production to importing was prevalent across the three countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
The pervasiveness of this form of adjustment leads once to question&#13;
its causes. Economies that have been closed to import competilLion for a long&#13;
time lack distribution channels at the beginning of the liberalization. In&#13;
Argentina and Uruguay there were also delays in obtaining importing licenses&#13;
for new products, and often it was only producers of similar products who had&#13;
licenses in their hands when the liberalization occurred. Thus producers&#13;
would be, at least temporarily, in a privileged position.&#13;
Even if this situation does not result and obtaining licenses is easy&#13;
for the distributor, in evaluating his expected profits he takes into account&#13;
both the cost of establishing the distribution channel and the length of the&#13;
liberalization. Thus if the distributor perceives that the liberalization&#13;
will be short-lived, he is likely to opt for low installment costs and will&#13;
import little and sell it at a high price because the demand for the imported&#13;
product is likely to be inelastic as it went unsatisfied for many years. For&#13;
a while at least, the first importers have room to behave&#13;
monopolistically. 5/ Although competition will increase with time, this&#13;
short-run behavior delays domestic price convergence to world levels.&#13;
4. Policy Implications&#13;
The papers in this volume give strong support to the view that the&#13;
effects of trade liberalization on firm efficiency may be substantial. 6/ The&#13;
evidence from the case studies reinforces the argument that the extent of&#13;
departure from profit maximization is related systematically to the regulatory&#13;
environment and to trade restrictions in particular. In the lethargic&#13;
environment of the pre-reform years, product quality and productivity were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
low. Foreign competition induced strong efficiency improvements among many&#13;
surviving import-competing producers.&#13;
Quite aside from the productivity gains resulting from the&#13;
exploitation of comparative advantage across sectors, there were also large&#13;
productivity gains at the firm level. Although the studies do not provide&#13;
direct evidence that efficiency depends upon effort and that effort was low in&#13;
the pre-reform years (beyond the casual evidence of manufacturers' not caring&#13;
about product quality), the findings are consistent with the argument proposed&#13;
by Corden (1970) that links firm efficiency with trade restrictions. The&#13;
argument is that trade restrictions raise the profits of import-competing&#13;
producers. In their choice between leisure and work in a regulated&#13;
environment, managers take their extra income as leisure rather than&#13;
substituting effort for leisure. So managers become less efficient in a&#13;
restricted environment. 7/ The studies in the volume show that major&#13;
efficiency gains can be achieved by firms within a short period when under&#13;
strong competition from other firms.&#13;
A related lesson is that lack of competition from abroad allows&#13;
domestic firms to establish dominant market positions and to behave non-&#13;
competitively. Pricing to maintain market share and mark-up pricing rules&#13;
prevailed before the reforms, with the result that prices were above marginal&#13;
cost. Interviews revealed that managers paid more heed to competitors as&#13;
import competition intensified. This response supports the "import&#13;
discipline" hypothesis, which predicts that the threat: of entry by foreign&#13;
competitors will lead domestic firms to adopt entry-forestalling prices more&#13;
closely approximating competitive prices. 8/ Thus increased foreign&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
competition also leads to gains by reducing collusive behavior among domestic&#13;
firms.&#13;
A corollary of increased firm efficiency is a reduction in the&#13;
workforce. The essays in this volume suggest that there is a direct relation&#13;
between the extent of efficiency gain by the firm and labor dismissal. Thus a&#13;
trade liberalization program must be accompanied by incentives to invest in&#13;
employment-generating activities, if it is to avoid high unemployment while&#13;
the economy is adjusting.&#13;
Last, and above all, the studies show that credibility is crucial for&#13;
success. With credibility lacking, adjustments are delayed and may take&#13;
undesired paths because of the anticipation of policy reversals in the near&#13;
future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

NOTES&#13;
1/  A comparative evaluation of the outcome of the reforms is given in Corbo,&#13;
Melo, and Tybout (forthcoming 1986).&#13;
2/  In 1982, CINVE interviewed managers of 289 manufacturing firms that&#13;
accounted for half of all manufacturing sales. When asked about the year&#13;
when import competition started, a third answered 1919 and another third&#13;
1980. Three-quarters of those interviewed concurred that import&#13;
competition intensified in 1981.&#13;
3/ These views should, however, be discounted, since they were often&#13;
expressed after the abandonmnet of the pre-announced exchange rate&#13;
policy. Nonetheless, entrepreneurs must have had little faith in the&#13;
duration of the program, as they often reported t:hat they did make&#13;
operating adjustments during this period.&#13;
4/  For further discussion of how the private debt was socialized in each&#13;
country see Tybout (1985).&#13;
5/ In Argentina twenty-one of thirty-one main imported products in 1978 were&#13;
imported by the ten most important firms, which accounted for more than 50&#13;
percent of imports.&#13;
6/ Lipsey (1960) put forward the argument with respect to Britain's adherence&#13;
to the EC in the following words:&#13;
Finally we come to the gains through forced efficiency.&#13;
Business firms may not be adopting methods known to be&#13;
technically more efficient than those now in use due to&#13;
inertia, a dislike of risk-taking, a wiLlingness to be content&#13;
with moderate profits, or a whole host of other reasons. If&#13;
these firms are thrown into competition with a number of firms&#13;
in other countries who are not adopting this conservative&#13;
policy, then the efficiency of the use of resources may&#13;
increase because technically more efficient production methods&#13;
are forced on the businessman now facing fierce foreign&#13;
competition.&#13;
Similar arguments are followed by Liebenstein (1966).&#13;
7/  See Corden (1970).  For a more formal presentation of the same ideas&#13;
see Martin (1978).&#13;
8/ Melo and Urata (1984) give indirect statistical evidence supporting&#13;
the import discipline hypothesis for Chile.&#13;

After several decades of development based on import substitution and&#13;
extensive direct controls of all markets, Argentina introduced a profound&#13;
reform package in 1976. The reforms included liberalization and stabilization&#13;
policies and spanned labor, commodity, and financial markets. Probably the&#13;
most important element of the liberalization package was the deregulation of&#13;
financial markets, lifting controls on domesti'c interest rates and, later on&#13;
capital flows. Another important element was the use of the exchange rate to&#13;
bring down inflationary expectations.&#13;
This paper uses macro aggregates and firm-level data to present an&#13;
overview of the reforms and interpret the adjustment by firms. The firm-level&#13;
data are the main results of interviews with nine manufacturing firms in&#13;
Argentina. The interviews probed how the changing economic conditions during&#13;
1976-81 affected the behavior of firms, how firms judged the reforms, and the&#13;
policies that firms followed to adapt to the reforms.&#13;
The paper has four parts. Section 1 describes the macroeconomic&#13;
environment firms operated under during the reform period. As background, the&#13;
account includes a description of the economic situation before the reforms.&#13;
Macro policies are then classified into phases to delineate the different set&#13;
of policies pursued during the period. Section 2 describes the major reforms&#13;
that affected the manufacturing sector and how they would be expected to&#13;
affect firm performance.  Section 3 describes and analyzes the overall&#13;
adjustment to the reforms by the nine firms. Conclusions follow in section 4.&#13;

1. The Macroeconomic Setting 1/&#13;
In discussing the main changes in economic conditions and policies during the&#13;
reforms, we distinguish three periods. The first one, from March 1976 to&#13;
December 1978, is characterized by the abandonment of price controls and by&#13;
attempts to close the fiscal gap and balance the external accoults. The&#13;
second period, from December 1978 to March 1981, was dominated by the attempt&#13;
to reduce inflation through the preannouncement of future exchange rate&#13;
changes. The third one, from March 1981 to the end of 1981, was dominated by&#13;
the need to balance the foreign accounts and to reverse a recession course.&#13;
On the eve of the reforms in March 1976, when a military junta&#13;
replaced a civilian government, Argentina was going through one of the most&#13;
difficult periods in its economic history. Table 2-1 tells the story with&#13;
numbers. Real GDP declined in 1975 and 1976. The inflation rate for 1976 was&#13;
444 percent and in the months before March 1976 it ran in the neighborhood of&#13;
1,000 percent a year. The public sector deficit (excluding the central bank&#13;
deficit) had risen from 8.9 percent of GDP in 1974 to 15.3 percent in 1975.&#13;
Foreign reserves were depleted, the trade deficit was high, and the currency&#13;
was substantially overvalued. Price controls prevailed across the economy.&#13;
The financial market was also subject to severe controls: the central bank&#13;
fixed interest rates and commercial banks had 100 percent reserve&#13;
requirements. And to influence trade flows, there were quantitative&#13;
restrictions, multiple exchange rates and direct prohibitions of imports. In&#13;
short, Argentina at the beginning of 1976 faced serious difficulties in the&#13;
productive sectors, substantial distortions in relative prices, and severe&#13;
imbalances on government and on external accounts. The economy was close to&#13;
hyperinflation, and the country was on the border of default.&#13;

For the new economic team, economic liberalization was one of the&#13;
main goals, frequently repeated during its tenure in power. Economic&#13;
liberalization was meant to imply opening the economy to transactions with&#13;
foreigners, eliminating controls, and making state activities subject to the&#13;
"subsidiary principle." This principle meant that the state should lay the&#13;
basis for economic activity but that it should not undertake anything the&#13;
private sector was willing to undertake. The other declared goal was to&#13;
rescue the economy by eliminating the government deficit and reducing&#13;
inflation through the control in the growth of the money. But the&#13;
liberalization and stabilization policies were not to increase! unemployment&#13;
(see Fernandez 1983). Here we briefly review the main stabilization and&#13;
liberalization measures before and after 1978, when the approach toward&#13;
stabilization policy changed.&#13;
Soon after the military takeover, price controls were lifted in the&#13;
commodity and housing markets. Because policies implemented in the first&#13;
months of the new government were aimed at eliminating the most evident&#13;
distortions in relative prices, this implied a devaluation of the peso.&#13;
Although a realignment of the exchange rate started before March 1976, the&#13;
real devaluation was subsequently deepened and the (purchasing--power-parity,&#13;
price-level-deflated, PPP-PLD) exchange rate rose 23 percent in 1976. The&#13;
government moved from a multiple to a single exchange system (see the nominal&#13;
exchange rates in columns 1 and 2 of table 2-2) and by 1976 the exchange rate&#13;
was unified and the black market exchange rate converged to the official&#13;
exchange rate.&#13;
From the outset, however, the exchange rate policy lacked&#13;
consistency. The authorities were reluctant to allow what might have been a&#13;
large real exchange rate appreciation resulting from capital inflows (see&#13;

table 2-3). They resorted to a "dirty float" policy and attempted to&#13;
sterilize capital inflows. This change, made without explicit announcement,&#13;
meant a departure from previous policy and paved the way for what would be an&#13;
explicit policy. As explained below, starting in December 19783, there would&#13;
be preannounced nominal devaluations of the peso, at a decreasiLng rate&#13;
independent of inflation (an "active crawling peg").&#13;
The government also reduced some barriers to foreign trade. It is&#13;
difficult to say how much trade liberalization actually took place. The most&#13;
significant liberalization of merchandise trade restrictions probably was the&#13;
reduction in export taxes on traditional exports. Controls on imports were&#13;
also eased as financial restrictions were lifted and average tariff rates were&#13;
reduced. 2/ But much redundant protection remained in 1976 and 1977.&#13;
Overall, the most important and far reaching reforms were those for&#13;
the domestic financial system in June 1977. The reforms includied the freedom&#13;
to set interest rates, a radical departure from roughly 30 years of controlled&#13;
interest rates. Furthermore, the 1977 reform introduced an offEicial 100&#13;
percent guarantee for all deposits.&#13;
After a year in power, and in view of the failure to achieve a&#13;
significant reduction in inflation, part of the economic team started to&#13;
identify (increases in) the money supply as the main source of inflation and&#13;
argued for tighter control of the quantity of money, which led to high real&#13;
interest rates in the last quarter of 1977 (table 2-4). The reamoval of&#13;
restrictions on capital flows and the high domestic real interest rates&#13;
contributed to a large capital inflow (see table 2-3) which in turn reduced&#13;
the real interest rate toward the second half of 1978.&#13;

In the second half of 1978, with inflation hovering around 150&#13;
percent a year, the same economic team came to use the exchange rate as the&#13;
central instrument of stabilization. This approach to stabilization involved&#13;
the preannouncement of the exchange rate in what popularly is referred to as&#13;
the tablita. 3/ The monthly devaluation rate was fixed at 5.2 percent for&#13;
January 1979, gradually falling to 3.8 percent in August. In April 1979 the&#13;
devaluation schedule was extended to December. In October 19179 and later in&#13;
September 1980 the schedule was extended, following the previous pattern, but&#13;
announcements were open-ended and ambiguous. 4/&#13;
How the tablita worked toward achieving its stabilization goal of&#13;
bringing domestic inflation down to the world rate (adjusted for the rate of&#13;
devaluation) is shown in figure 2-1. Initially, there was an acceleration in&#13;
the rate of industrial price increases. This acceleration can be explained by&#13;
Rodriguez's preannouncement model based on perfect capital mobility and&#13;
adaptive expectations (1983). Because of redundant protection, the industrial&#13;
sector can be treated in the short run as a nontraded sector. Immediately&#13;
following the preannouncement, the nominal interest rate converges to the&#13;
exogenously given world rate (plus the rate of devaluation). At this time,&#13;
the real interest rate turns negative (see column 3, table 2-4), creating&#13;
excess demand for industrial goods.  This increase in demand has a counterpart&#13;
in the increase in capital inflows. Finally, absorption exceeds income (see&#13;
columns 1-4, table 2-1). As redundant protection disappears, firms in the&#13;
manufacturing sector reduce their mark-up over costs, and infLation starts to&#13;
converge toward world inflation (plus the rate of devaluation). But by mid-&#13;
1980 the gap between domestic and foreign inflation widens again because the&#13;
central bank had to raise the money base to prevent a chain cf bankruptcies&#13;
after a major bank failure in April 1980.&#13;

Because domestic inflation did not respond rapidLy to the tablita,&#13;
competitiveness of Argentine products deteriorated rapidly. The PPP-PLD&#13;
exchange rate -- a measure of the real exchange rate appreciation -- fell 33&#13;
percent between 1978 and 1980 and absorption growth far e!xceeded GDP growth&#13;
during 1979 and 1980 (table 2-1). The real exchange rate! appreciation was&#13;
extremely large. Firms in exportables and importables alike were hit by this&#13;
appreciation, though they benefited temporarily from negative real interest&#13;
rates. The continuing appreciation of the real exchange rate led everyone to&#13;
doubt that the tsblita could be sustained far in the future. Then, the flow&#13;
of imported consumer goods increased rapidly in anticipation of capital gains&#13;
that would accompany a maxidevaluation. Between 1978 and 1980 the real dollar&#13;
value of imported consumer goods increased 4.6 times (table 2-2).&#13;
Crowing uncertainty about the sustainability of the current account&#13;
deficit created expectations of a devaluation. These expectations about&#13;
devaluation were fueled by stress in the financial system -- by the bankruptcy&#13;
of the largest private bank in April 1980. They were also fueled by&#13;
uncertainties about the economic policies of the new team to take office in&#13;
February 1981.&#13;
The combination of free interest rates and deposit insurance allowed&#13;
insolvent financial institutions to pursue "'liability management" policies.&#13;
Banks facing difficulties would raise interest rates on deposits to attract&#13;
the funds necessary to pay interest due and, although the state of insolvency&#13;
was aggravated, depositors were not affected because of the official&#13;
guarantee. This "liability management" policy drove interest rates up and led&#13;
to average real interest rates of about 30 percent a year.&#13;
In April 1981, according to rules defined by the military government,&#13;
a new junta replaced the first one. At this time the recession was deepening,&#13;

and the capital and current accounts of the balance of payments were both&#13;

rates and the need to reverse the excess of expenditure growth over income&#13;
growth squeezed firms in the manufacturing sector in two ways: increasing&#13;
financial costs and declining demand. At this stage, the government decided&#13;
to abandon the strategy of a preannounced exchange rate and devalued in April&#13;
(by 24 percent) and in June (by 23 percent). But: these devaluations came too&#13;
late and were too small. They failed to stabilize this foreign exchange&#13;
market and stop the outflow of capital. Estimates for 1980 and 1981 suggest a&#13;
capital flight of more than $11 billion (see short-term capital and other in&#13;
table 2-3). Despite numerous other measures, the recession could not be&#13;
reversed, and uncertainty was mounting. In 1981 the GDP declined 6 percent,&#13;
industrial production fell 16 percent, inflation accelerated, and real&#13;
interest rates continued to be very high. Disputes in the government and&#13;
unmade decisions on important issues affecting the private sector led to&#13;
further deterioration in the economic environment. The government was&#13;
replaced in December 1981.&#13;
2. The Impact of the Reforms on the Manufacturing Sector&#13;
To describe how the environment for manufacturing firms evolved, we first&#13;
review briefly the main reforms in commodity and factor markets. We then&#13;
discuss the expected adjustment by firms to the new environment and assess the&#13;
impact of the reforms on prices, output, and employment in manufacturing.&#13;
The authorities rapidly dismantled the regime of price controls, but&#13;
imposed wage controls. The price controls had covered a wide range of&#13;
products entering a worker's consumption basket and were normally enforced for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
retail goods. By the end of 1978 almost all price controls had been&#13;
abandoned. Wages, however, were subject to guidelines. Penalties enforced&#13;
through income tax law still existed for firms paying salary increases higher&#13;
than the guidelines. Firms paying salaries higher than the guidelines were&#13;
not allowed to impute to labor costs those amounts in excess of approved&#13;
salaries. But since wage costs were not an important element of prime cost&#13;
(see table 2-4), the effect of this regulation did not significantly affect&#13;
firm behavior.&#13;
Before the reform period, the government set guidelines for salary&#13;
increments separately for public and private employees. The purpose of these&#13;
regulations, especially during 1973-76, was to reduce the spread in the salary&#13;
scale across labor skills. Starting in 1976, the government; sought to reverse&#13;
this trend. First, the government issued guidelines for basic salaries to&#13;
widen the differences between salary scales within a given industry. At the&#13;
same time, industrywide salaries were allowed to adjust to changes in market&#13;
conditions. With time, firms had an increasingly greater participation in&#13;
setting salary levels. Thus in March 1977 a more flexibLe policy was pursued,&#13;
allowing firms to use certain margins to be paid according to their own&#13;
criteria. Firms were given guidelines for the basic adjustment of salaries,&#13;
but they had at their disposal a global amount to distribute among workers as&#13;
they considered most appropriate. This amount was raised from 10 percent of&#13;
the wage bill in March 1977 to 40 percent in October 1977 and 75 percent in&#13;
August 1978. The results of this policy of attempting to diminish the power&#13;
of unions and let market forces determine wages are given in the last column&#13;
of table 2-4. The coefficient of variation of wages within manufacturing&#13;
increased by 4 percentage points between 1977 and 1980, suggesting that&#13;
government policy was at least partly successful.&#13;

In October 1980 changes in tax legislation reduced labor costs and&#13;
made it easier for firms to dismiss workers. A social security tax of 15&#13;
percent and a tax for housing subsidies and loans of 5 percent were abolished,&#13;
both paid by firms on the basis of the wage bill. Legal chLanges, the&#13;
decreasing importance of labor costs in total costs (see table 2-4), and a&#13;
loss of political power of labor unions made it easier for firms to dismiss&#13;
employees. Ever since Peron came to power, firms in Argentina have been&#13;
required to pay a dismissed worker one month's salary for each year the worker&#13;
has been with the firm. Starting in October 1980 this compensation was to be&#13;
paid on the basis of the minimum salary, not the average salary received by&#13;
the worker.&#13;
At the end of 1976, when the exchange rate system was unified and&#13;
financial restrictions on imports were lifted, the tariff schedule was also&#13;
changed. Average tariff rates were reduced from 93 percent to 52 percent.&#13;
But the change in tariff was more apparent than real because the reduction&#13;
meant a lowering of redundant protection rates.  There is ample evidence that&#13;
the previous tariff included substantial "water" (Nogues 1978 and Wogart and&#13;
Marques 1984). An idea of how much protection domestic firms enjoyed around&#13;
the early part of the reforms is given by the estimates of Legal tariff rates&#13;
and tariff redundancy in table 2-5. Export taxes whose rates were between 10&#13;
percent and 50 percent were lowered to rates between 5 percent and 25 percent.&#13;
And export incentives to nontraditional exports were reduced to a maximum of&#13;
25 percent. But the result, on the whole, was some reduction in dispersion.&#13;
In January 1979 a new tariff system was announced along with a&#13;
program for further graduated cuts. The previous classification of goods was&#13;
also changed, but the basic idea of giving more protection to goods with a&#13;
greater proportion of internal value added was kept. The schedule for tariff&#13;

reduction implied moderate cuts at the beginning with accelerated cuts in&#13;
later years (see Nogues 1983).&#13;
However, almost immediately after being put into effect, the program&#13;
changed. The schedule for tariff reduction was advanced when the price of a&#13;
good was raised beyond what was justified by the increase in input costs.&#13;
This norm was applied to several products in particular to consumer goods. In&#13;
April 1979 the schedule of tariff reductions for capital goods was&#13;
accelerated, and tariff rates originally planned for 1984 went into effect.&#13;
In July 1980 further important changes in the structure of nontariff taxes&#13;
took place. All previous taxes on imports -- some of them under the label of&#13;
fees -- were integrated with the tariff schedule to which a ceiling of 55&#13;
percent was imposed. This change implied a reduction of consumption good&#13;
protection in the scheduled tariff. Thus, like the preannounced exchange&#13;
rate, the tariff reform was subjected to sporadic changes that created&#13;
uncertainty.&#13;
The relationship between internal and external prices was therefore&#13;
subject to three instruments:  a program of tariff reform, an effective&#13;
revaluation of the exchange rate, and a mechanism to bring forward the&#13;
scheduled tariff cuts. The last two were a major source of uncertainty for&#13;
the private sector. There is some evidence on the relative impact of tariff&#13;
cuts and real exchange rate appreciation on protection in the manufacturing&#13;
sector. Using a price survey for 40 traded industrial products, Wogart and&#13;
Marques (1984) computed the ratio of the import price (inclusive of tariffs&#13;
and import fees) to the ex-factory price of a corresponding domestic good.&#13;
Using value-added weights for aggregation over individual prooducts, they&#13;
report the following values: June 1977 = 1.86; January 1979 = 1.04, August&#13;
1979 = 0.86, indicating that redundancy was eliminated around January&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
1979. 5/  Their calculations indicate that the range and standard deviation of&#13;
the ratios fell throughout suggesting that foreign competititon was affecting&#13;
industries fairly evenly. Wogart and Marques (1984) also show that&#13;
appreciation of the real exchange rate (not tariff liberalization) eliminated&#13;
redundancy in protection. In sum, the rapidly declining real exchange rate&#13;
was the policymaker's most important means of enforcing competition.&#13;
As long as there was redundant protection in the system, one could&#13;
expect manufacturing firms to follow an oligopolistic behavior for price and&#13;
quantity decisions. This assumption derives from the observation that&#13;
barriers to entry into manufacturing were high for two reasons. One is the&#13;
limitation on imports. The other is the limitation in access to working&#13;
capital in the fragmented capital market before the reforms. Large firms, who&#13;
also benefited from subsidies because of highly negative real interest rates&#13;
ex post, had the easiest access to working capital. As discussed in de Melo&#13;
and Urata (1984), one would expect the mark-up rate over prime costs, to fall&#13;
substantially starting in late 1979 as the threat from an increasing import&#13;
share in domestic supply would reduce collusive behavior. But buoyant growth&#13;
in final demand -- associated with the excess of absorption over income --&#13;
would partly offset this effect.&#13;
On the input side, the prime elements of cost are labor, intermediate&#13;
inputs and working capital. As shown in table 2-4, the cost of labor declined&#13;
for most of the period but never exceeded 9 percent of total costs. While the&#13;
costs of imported intermediates fell, firms were often obliged to purchase&#13;
such domestically produced goods as steel, so this effect was probably&#13;
minimal. That leaves the cost of working capital, associated with labor&#13;
payments in advance of sales and the holding of inventories. The figures in&#13;
table 2-4 show that the cost of finance fluctuated greatly throughout the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
period. The real interest rate on peso-denominated loans turned positive for&#13;
the first time in the last quarter of 1977. it then turned negative&#13;
throughout the second half of 1979, before turning positive once more and&#13;
remaining highly positive until the second quarter of 1981. At: the same time,&#13;
there was an incentive for firms to shift into dollar-denominated debts which&#13;
carried a negative real interest rate.&#13;
Because of the reforms, employment in the manufacturing sector fell&#13;
below its level in 1970, and there was an associated increase in labor&#13;
productivity (table 2-6). Between 1977 and 1980 output increased 13 percent&#13;
for the high-protection group but declined 10 percent for the group exposed to&#13;
import competition. Not surprisingly, the latter group cut employment by 20&#13;
percent. But even the high-protection group cut employment by 19 percent,&#13;
accounting for the high growth of labor productivity for that group. On the&#13;
other hand, the low-protection group had its productivity decline slightly&#13;
because firms developed idle capacity.&#13;
3. How Firms Assessed the Shocks and Adjusted Their Operations&#13;
The foregoing review suggests that firms benefited from some poLicy changes&#13;
but also had difficulties in adjusting to the new economic environment. One&#13;
would expect those difficulties to have been mounting from 197SI onwards as a&#13;
result of increasing financial costs and increasing foreign competition. The&#13;
magnitude of changes in the economic environment for firms also suggests that&#13;
entrepreneurs must have experimented with various adjustments as policies&#13;
changed.&#13;

Firms were selected through personal contacts with the aim of having&#13;
the sample cover different sectors, firm sizes, and sales orientations.&#13;
Interviews were conducted between May and September 1983. The questionnaire&#13;
was designed to elicit how firms perceived the reforms and how they adjusted&#13;
to them. The first section of the questionnaire was designed to find out how&#13;
managers judged the sources of change in economic conditions; the second was&#13;
designed to appraise delays in the reaction of firms; the third to appraise&#13;
the areas of adjustment (see the annex to this volume for the basic&#13;
questionnaire administered to firms). Some of the firms we interviewed are&#13;
traded corporations in the Buenos Aires stock market. We had access to their&#13;
income and balance sheet statements, which allowed us to observe earnings&#13;
streams, debt profiles, and rates of return annually between 1977 and 1979 and&#13;
quarterly in 1980 and 1981. The measures reported below are taken from Petrei&#13;
and Tybout (1984).&#13;
Of the nine firms interviewed, two belong to financial groups, four&#13;
are managed by families, and three have their ownership distributed among&#13;
several people. (For further description of the firms, see the appendix to&#13;
this chapter). Four of the firms can be considered large, the rest of medium&#13;
size (table 2-7). The proportion of sales exported varied little and in&#13;
general was not above 10 percent. Although four firms exportecd more before&#13;
the reform, all except one (firm F), produced goods that competed with imports&#13;
in the local market.&#13;
Ranking Favorable and Unfavorable Shocks&#13;
A senior executive from each firm was asked about the impact of&#13;
policy changes on operations. The questions covered labor market regulations,&#13;
trade and exchange rate practices, and the working of domestic goods and&#13;

financial markets. The purpose was to elicit from managers and entrepreneurs&#13;
their perceptions about the most favorable and unfavorable effects of the&#13;
reforms for the operation of their firm. For each policy area, a few changes&#13;
were targeted for evaluation, some favorable and others unfavorable. The&#13;
interviewee had to score each change on a scale from 0 (not relevant) to 4&#13;
(very important).&#13;
None of the favorable changes was signaled as particuLarly important&#13;
by all firms (table 2-8). The highest average scores were around the value of&#13;
2, -- that is, "of some importance." The favorable responses related to the&#13;
possibilities of purchasing foreign machinery and equipment and to changes in&#13;
the functioning of capital markets which improved access to working and fixed&#13;
capital. This is not surprising in view of the calculated negative real&#13;
financial costs for three of the firms. These factors were mcre important for&#13;
bigger firms. Bigger firms in general were in a better position to obtain&#13;
foreign credits. In addition, as shown in Petrei and Tybout (1984), they were&#13;
able to benefit from exchange insurance schemes and in some cases to make&#13;
timely shifts from foreign to domestic finance, thus avoiding high costs of&#13;
devaluation.&#13;
Substituting imported raw materials for local ones, reduced&#13;
constraints on laying off employees, and fewer restrictions for the&#13;
introduction of imported goods were considered of lesser importance. The&#13;
possibility of adjusting the number of employees layoffs nevertheless was&#13;
important for the textile producer. As indicated earlier, changes in the law&#13;
and in the balance of power between labor unions and firm owners improved&#13;
labor relations by, among others, bringing down absenteeism. Elut better labor&#13;
relations mostly benefited conglomerates rather than the smaller family-owned&#13;
firms.&#13;

Though not reflected in the questionnaire responses, the lifting of&#13;
import restrictions on raw materials was important for the soap producer. The&#13;
soap producer could put into operation machinery bought in 1974 but not yet&#13;
used because of difficulties in importing the main part required by that piece&#13;
of equipment. Cases such as this were frequent on the eve of the reforms.&#13;
Answers to this question varied significantly across firms, clepending on their&#13;
import content. It is interesting to note that the interviewees did not&#13;
perceive as significant the elimination of restrictions to acquire know-how&#13;
from abroad, even though they often said in conversation that such&#13;
acquisitions were important. If this perception is an accurate description of&#13;
the environment firms operated in, given that acquisition of know-how from&#13;
abroad was often an important form of adjustment for firms in our sample, then&#13;
it must be concluded that there were in effect no impediments to the&#13;
acquisition of know-how, only a lack of incentive to acquisition. In sum,&#13;
what emerges from the recorded perceptions is that the reforms were not viewed&#13;
as particularly helpful for the operation of the firm, because! the favorable&#13;
influences were nullified by negative ones.&#13;
A much clearer picture emerges from the responses on unfavorable&#13;
changes. Scores for most of these changes are much higher and in general&#13;
subject to less dispersion than those on favorable changes. The unfavorable&#13;
rankings show that changes in the financial system related to the high cost of&#13;
working capital were perceived as harmful. Increasing foreign competition due&#13;
to the overvaluation of the peso and the reduction in import restrictions, was&#13;
also generally considered important. But these responses must: be interpreted&#13;
cautiously, at least for the textile, pulp-and-paper, and ceramic-and-steel&#13;
fixtures producers, since the latter two maintained high and fairly constant&#13;
gross margins throughout.&#13;

Almost all interviewees described and emphatically expressed problems&#13;
created by the exchange rate policy and by the working of the financial&#13;
system. This is not surprising in view of the high and fluctuating real&#13;
interest rates reported in table 2-4 and the fluctuating purchasing-power-&#13;
parity price-level-deflated exchange rate in table 2-2. For example, sales&#13;
for the hydraulic pump producer fell in 1981 to 20 percent of the 1976 level&#13;
because of import competition. With the benefit of Ihindsight, most&#13;
interviewees said that they felt at the time that the exchange rate policy&#13;
pursued in 1979 and 1980 was temporary, and that sooner or later it would come&#13;
to an end. But in general they admitted that they had not anticipated the&#13;
long period that would elapse before the policy reversal.&#13;
Financial constraints affected different firms differently. One had&#13;
practically no debts and therefore could concentrate all adjustment efforts on&#13;
production and marketing. Even so, the firm considered the lack of medium and&#13;
long-run capital and the high costs of working capital to be quite&#13;
unfavorable.  Another one had already contracted impcrtant debts for plant&#13;
expansion and had to devote enormous managerial efforts and resources to make&#13;
adjustments and pursue an adequate financial course. Another firm even had to&#13;
undergo a concurso -- a judicial procedure in Argentina whereby a firm facing&#13;
financial difficulties makes arrangements with its creditors for deferred&#13;
payments. Larger firms, including the textile producer, hLad relatively easy&#13;
access to external finance for working capital, and to long-term capital for&#13;
plant expansion. Many firms were successful in switching in time to internal&#13;
finance, even at a relatively high interest rate, thereby avoiding the large&#13;
devaluation-induced capital losses of 1981.&#13;
Three firms in the sample said they were seriously affected by the&#13;
reduced profitability of exporting due to the combination of a lower dollar&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

and a lower peso value for their exports.  Six of the firms also ranked the&#13;
reduction in import restrictions highly among unfavorable shocks. Perhaps the&#13;
agricultural machinery producer offers the best example of the severe&#13;
adjustment problems created by a tariff reduction combined with an overvalued&#13;
currency. As indicated in table 2-9, from 1970 to 1974 domestic and export&#13;
sales of tractors and agricultural machinery grew rapidly. In 1974, exports&#13;
of tractors represented 17 percent of production. These promising&#13;
developments led two firms in our sample to contract for expansion loans,&#13;
later canceled.&#13;
Because tariffs on imports of agricultural machinery were reduced&#13;
while basic inputs (iron and steel products) remained highly protected, the&#13;
effective rate of protection for agricultural machinery feLl drastically.&#13;
Furthermore, the profitability of agricultural exports was reduced as the&#13;
overvaluation of the peso increased. The agricultural sector adjusted by&#13;
postponing investment. As a result, the number of tractors sold in 1981 was&#13;
only 20 percent of that in 1977.&#13;
Recall that the scheduled reduction of customs duties on capital&#13;
goods was accelerated in 1979: tariff protection for local producers was&#13;
brought down from 40-60 percent to a new low of only 20 percent -- a level&#13;
originally supposed to be reached only in 1984. Imports, aLlready favored by&#13;
the peso appreciation, were stimulated further.&#13;
The figures in table 2-9 show that the market for tractors declined&#13;
abruptly in 1980 to roughly half that in the previous year. This decline in&#13;
demand caused some firms to close down. One leading firm (not in our sample)&#13;
with a 35-40 percent share of the local market closed down for several months&#13;
after accumulating manufactured stocks equal to nearly a year's worth of&#13;
regular sales. Even more striking is the evolution of the number of imported&#13;

units sold between 1979 and 1981, the period of the peso's overvaluation. The&#13;
stockpiling of imported tractors rose dramaticalLy in anticipation of capital&#13;
gains when the maxidevaluation would finally occur. 6/ Despite falling&#13;
domestic sales reflecting the effects of declining agricultural exports,&#13;
imports of tractors tripled between 1978 and 1979 and doubled again between&#13;
1980 and 1981.&#13;
The lack of medium and long term finance varied from irrelevant to&#13;
very important. Finally, labor market changes were perceived as unimportant&#13;
probably because, as suggested by the figures in table 2-4, labor costs were a&#13;
small fraction of total costs.&#13;
Credibility of the Reforms&#13;
Although reactions varied from firm to firm, in general, there was a&#13;
substantial lag between the announcement of the reforms and the corresponding&#13;
initial adjustments by the firms. With one exception (firm I reacted&#13;
immediately), the lag ranged from three to twenty months. Ihis answer is&#13;
consistent with answers to other parts of the questionnaire -- that is,&#13;
measures of the perceived viability and duration of the reforms show that they&#13;
were received with skepticism. Interestingly, larger firms tend to show a&#13;
shorter lag, perhaps because of less inertia in their management. But the&#13;
sample is too small to suggest any general conclusion. Mosc respondents also&#13;
mentioned a significant contradiction between the poLicy to open the economy&#13;
gradually and the sudden lowering of tariff and overvaluation of the currency.&#13;
Some interviewees elaborated more on this general idea. One&#13;
mentioned that the increasing competition from outside prevented his firm from&#13;
taking advantage of economies of scale by making substantial investments in&#13;
plant and equipment. Others mentioned the contradictions between the stated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
purposes of the financial reform and what took place. One interviewee&#13;
understood that the intent of the financial reform was to lead to zero real&#13;
rates of interest) and others understood that the intent was to increase&#13;
access to both medium and long run credit. Yet, credit was soon scarce, and&#13;
high positive interest rates prevailed for a long period.&#13;
All answers show a lack of credibility about the duration of the&#13;
reforms and about their final success. The executives interviewed thought&#13;
that increasing foreign competition facing firms in 1979 and 1980 would&#13;
eventually be brought to an end.  In their opinion, increasing current account&#13;
deficits and continuing borrowing from abroad could not go on indefinitely.&#13;
They thought the authorities would finally realize that policies being pursued&#13;
were too costly in terms of required adjustments and would have to yield to&#13;
political and group pressures. As a result, during the reform years,&#13;
decisions about personnel management and investments were subject to a wait-&#13;
and-see stance. Despite increased foreign competition, many firms decided to&#13;
keep a basic organization rather than to resort to extensive layoffs.  One&#13;
firm was keeping "idle" workers in 1980 because the manager felt that the&#13;
policies would soon change and that he would be able to avoid the costs of&#13;
laying off and rehiring. In sum, difficulties were miostly perceived as&#13;
temporary, and managers often chose to keep workers occupied in low&#13;
productivity tasks to avoid the costs associated with reorganization and&#13;
retraining of new personnel when activity again lpicked up. For example, few&#13;
firms, even among the large ones, took advantage of the repeal of a 1.5&#13;
percent tax on labor costs earmarked for technical training by spending&#13;
equivalent amounts on their own training program.&#13;

Major Firm Adjustments&#13;
Table 2-10 summarizes the role of adjustments in the areas of&#13;
production, prices and marketing, labor practices, investment, and financial&#13;
decisions taken by the firm during the period. Not surprisingly, the need to&#13;
be more cautious about financial management was ranked high. So were the&#13;
introduction of new products, changes in marketing strategy, and changes in&#13;
inventory policy.&#13;
The introduction of new products often became important in the face&#13;
of increasing competition from abroad. But the expansion of product lines&#13;
gained in importance mainly while the economy was expanding. All firms&#13;
attached some importance to this adjustment. The importance of changes in&#13;
inventory management is the consequence of higher financial costs. Before the&#13;
reforms, the firms in our sample almost always had access to credit at highly&#13;
subsidized rates. As table 2-4 shows, the cost of credit turned positive in&#13;
the middle of 1979 and remained very high throughout 1980, forcing firms to&#13;
become increasingly aware of ways to reduce financial costs. Following a&#13;
careful inventory policy was one way to reduce financial costs. The decision&#13;
was to minimize the financial cost of carrying domestic inventories. For&#13;
imported inventories, the decision also took into account the potential&#13;
capital gain from an eventual devaluation of the peso. Some executives&#13;
introduced fairly sophisticated inventory management techniques.&#13;
Changes in activity, adjustments to product quality, and greater&#13;
vertical integration follow in importance. Greater vertical, integration is&#13;
somewhat surprising since an expected result from opening thie economy to&#13;
foreign competition would be greater specialization. With a larger share of&#13;
tradables being traded, comparative advantage would be expected to lead to&#13;
greater specialization. But, most firms in our small sample! moved toward&#13;

greater vertical integration. This is due in part to the fact that we&#13;
interviewed "survivors" -- often relatively large firms in the markets they&#13;
supply.&#13;
The access to subsidized capital encouraged merger activity. So did&#13;
plant consolidations through closedowns. Some interviewees also reported that&#13;
as increased foreign competition reduced the demand for their product, they&#13;
started carrying out activities previously contracted out to third parties.&#13;
More interesting are the cases of vertical integration that allegedly&#13;
took place to increase efficiency. This was the case for the ceramic producer&#13;
(firm D) and the candy producer (firm H). It is known from industrial&#13;
organization theory that for some industries administrative coordination is&#13;
superior to market mechanisms and to contractual agreements, in which case&#13;
industrial groups (corporations) will emerge because of the greater efficiency&#13;
of internal coordination. In such cases multi-unit enterprises will&#13;
predominate to reap the economies from transactions within the firm relative&#13;
to market transactions. The general idea is that the firm in large part&#13;
consists of nonmarket institutions whose functions are to deal with resource&#13;
allocation in the presence of informational constraints that markets handle&#13;
poorly (See Chandler 1977 and Williamson 1975). It is not clear that greater&#13;
efficiency rather than attempts to enhance their monopoly power was the reason&#13;
for this increase in vertical integration. But the interviews -- especially&#13;
the one with the candy producer -- raise this possibility although bypassing&#13;
excessive market regulation was also stated as a reason for this great&#13;
vertical integration.&#13;
Most managers attached some importance to changes in marketing&#13;
strategy but little importance to changes in pricing decisions. Three&#13;
interviewees expressed difficulties in reducing their advertising and&#13;

administrative expenses. Despite the relativeLy low scores given to&#13;
adjustment in this area, some changes were significant.  For instance, the&#13;
operating margin for the textile producer fell dramatically (figure 2-4).&#13;
Before the reforms the pulp-and-paper producer was selling all its production&#13;
to a few distributors, which sold the products under their own brands. As&#13;
sales decreased, the firm changed its marketing strategy and started using its&#13;
own brand name, changing product presentation, and selling directly to&#13;
retailers. The firm manager reported that the introduction of new products&#13;
was prompted by competition from abroad and was possible because of access to&#13;
foreign know-how. He also noted that the lack of growth of the economy was a&#13;
major drawback.&#13;
Import competitition led firms producing final products to improve&#13;
quality.  The ceramic-and-steel-fixtures producer bought blueprints from&#13;
European firms and started imitating European styles. Likewise, the textile&#13;
producer reacted to foreign competition by imitating American and European&#13;
clothing styles and introduced sports fashions. The soap producer, previously&#13;
marketing only undifferentiated soap, successfuLly introduced a high-quality&#13;
brand-name soap.&#13;
Possibilities to negotiate labor contracts more freely and hence to&#13;
reduce the labor force were the most important changes in labor practice.&#13;
Undoubtedly, the new environment permitted firms to introduce greater&#13;
discipline.  Before 1976, labor leaders were very powerful and were able to&#13;
exercise substantial pressure on firms on both salaries and on working&#13;
conditions. Under the military government, thiEs situation changed, and&#13;
private firms operated with fewer restrictions. 7/ Although some firms&#13;
engaged in production improvements and introduceid new technologies, the&#13;
reduction in employment seems to have been more the result of the reduction in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
demand for the firms' products than the result of a change in factor&#13;
proportions.&#13;
For two firms, the small adjustments in labor force were compensated&#13;
by large changes in capacity utilization. The hydraulic-pump producer and the&#13;
ceramic-and-steel fixtures producer experienced a large drop in capacity&#13;
utilization (table 2-11). Surprisingly, the other firms did not show much&#13;
variation in their capacity utilization.&#13;
As expected, the scores on financial adjustment indicaLte that&#13;
managers had to become more cautious about monitoring financial costs. This&#13;
lesson turned out to be very costly to learn. The policy of negative interest&#13;
rates was so much ingrained in Argentina that the rule of "obtaining as much&#13;
credit as possible" was an axiom for most firms. Changes in thre financial&#13;
system came fast, so many firms were taken by surprise by high interest&#13;
rates. With substantial debts and investment plans already under way&#13;
financial adjustments became difficult. In fact, investment plans often had&#13;
to be postponed.&#13;
To find out more about the evolution of firm decisions, we asked the&#13;
inteviewees to rank the factors that affected market shares and pricing&#13;
decisions before the reforms, during 1977-78, and during 1979-81. As&#13;
expected, the average scores for the group indicated that compe!titive pricing&#13;
and product quality played an increasingly important role through time and&#13;
that pricing decisions were increasingly affected by import comlpetition. In&#13;
the same vein, we also asked firms to break down for 1976-79 and 1979-81 the&#13;
scores on the five areas of adjustment identified in table 2-1O. Again, the&#13;
scores indicated that each form of adjustment was more importanlt in the second&#13;
period than the first, confirming that the redundant protection was eliminated&#13;
around early 1979.&#13;

Before March 1976 price decisions were mostly influenced by&#13;
expectations about price controls and by the goal of maintaining market&#13;
share. Competition from domestic producers or from abroad was not perceived&#13;
as important.  This assessment is consistent with an economy where protection&#13;
was "made to measure" and where firms with very different productivity levels&#13;
could coexist. During 1977-78 this ranking changed due to the impact of&#13;
external competition. Price decisions became influenced by competing imported&#13;
goods and by input prices. These two factors kept their importance during the&#13;
1979-81 period, while the expectations of price controls again gained in&#13;
importance. Finally the scores show that as working capital became more&#13;
costly, most firms tended to adjust by shortening the period of installment&#13;
credit to customers. For our small sample, firms appear to ha've lost market&#13;
shares only transitorily during the period of the peso appreciation. In many&#13;
cases, firms ultimately benefited from the closing down of other firms during&#13;
that period.&#13;
For firms B, D, and E, we have constructed indicators of earnings and&#13;
financial structure. The earnings indicators include gross margins, defined&#13;
as sales minus cost of sales over sales; operating margins, defined as gross&#13;
margins corrected for administrative and marketing costs; operating margins&#13;
less adjusted financial costs, defined as operating margins less total nominal&#13;
interest payments minus the inflation gains (losses) on holding net monetary&#13;
liabilities (assets). As noted in Tybout (1984) because the income statements&#13;
are not fully corrected for inflation, earnings streams tend tc be overstated&#13;
in the high inflation periods. This is so because input costs are&#13;
understated, the understatement being roughly proportional to the rate of&#13;
inflation. The indicators of financial structure include the gearing ratio,&#13;
defined as total debt divided by total assets (physical and financial); net&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
foreign assets as a proportion of total debt; and average real financial&#13;
costs, defined as total interest payments on net monetary liabilities&#13;
expressed as a percentage of net monetary liabilities. Financial structure&#13;
and margins are expected to vary across manufacturing activities for several&#13;
reasons, including differences in the capital intensity of production and in&#13;
value-added ratios. So, the comparisons across firms should be only in terms&#13;
of different patterns of adjustments through time.&#13;
Figure 2-2 shows the three earnings streams (expressed as a&#13;
percentage of sales) computed from firm B's accounts. Gross margins for firm&#13;
B remained above 30 percent throughout the period, suggesting that the firm's&#13;
mark-up over labor and material input costs was not affected by the reforms&#13;
and that the firm did not feel the pressures from foreign competition. There&#13;
is, however, an increase in margins after the devaluationis in early 1981,&#13;
followed by a precipitous drop in the last quarter, signaling the effects of&#13;
the recession. The acquisition of other plants is shown in the rising&#13;
employment index. When adjusted financial costs (financial charges adjusted&#13;
for the erosion in the value of monetary liabilities caused by inflation) are&#13;
subtracted, the picture changes drastically. During 1978 and 1979 the firm&#13;
received a large subsidy from the financial sector because it had net monetary&#13;
liabilities at negative real interest rates, which encouraged the firm to&#13;
acquire further monetary liabilities. When the real interest rates turned&#13;
positive in 1980 there was a pronounced squeeze on the firm's earnings stream&#13;
after financial costs. Interestingly, even though thie firm roughly doubled the&#13;
share of its dollar-denominated debt in the middle of 1980, average real&#13;
financial costs (expressed in net monetary liabilities) fell after the&#13;
devaluations. This suggests that firm B benefited from exchange guarantees on&#13;

its dollar denominated debt. In sum, the accounts suggest that firm B was&#13;
fairly isolated from shocks from the real side until the recession came in&#13;
1981 and that it benefited from large financial subsidies at the beginning and&#13;
end of period.&#13;
As figure 2-3 shows, firm D maintained high gross margins throughout&#13;
the period. As a supplier of the construction industry which boomed during&#13;
the period of real exchange rate appreciation and as a dominant supplier of&#13;
the market for its main products, the firm was insulated from foreign&#13;
competition. Unlike the cardboard producer, the ceramic-and-enamel producer&#13;
improved its solvency position and did not contract much foreign debt. This&#13;
"'prudent" financial management meant that it did not receive financial&#13;
subsidies, except in 1978 and 1979. By the middle oi 1978, it appears that&#13;
the firm was retiring monetary liabilities, which would explain why financial&#13;
costs reduced the firm's earnings stream.  Nor did the firm benefit much from&#13;
dollar-denominated debt when it was much cheaper to contract than peso debt --&#13;
or from the foreign exchange guarantees later. Conservative financial&#13;
management thus proved costly for this firm, though its ovrerall performance&#13;
benefited from a strong earnings stream.&#13;
In contrast with the pulp-and-paper and ceramic-and-enamel fixtures&#13;
producers, the textile producer (firm D) encountered substantial foreign&#13;
competition. Gross margins fell drastically during the period of real&#13;
exchange rate appreciation, but begun to recover in the third quarter of 1980&#13;
(see figure 2-4). The price comparisons by Wogart and Marques (1984) show&#13;
that in January 1979 the domestic currency price of imported textiles was&#13;
already 8 percent below the price of domestically produced textiles and that&#13;
by August of 1979 it was 32 percent lower. By January 1979 imported yarn,&#13;
socks, and shirts had a subsidy of between 14 percent and 21 percent. Not&#13;

surprisingly, the gross margin for the textile producer fell from 38 percent&#13;
in 1978 to 17 percent in 1979. This precipitous fall continued until the&#13;
middle of 1980, when gross margins started improving again. But, operating&#13;
margins remained negative until the last quarter of 1980, and the 1981&#13;
devaluations were insufficient to offset the recession-induced decline in&#13;
demand, so the firm's negative operating margins continued. The adjustment by&#13;
the firm is also evident from the decline in employment.&#13;
Fortunately for the textile producer, developments were not as bleak&#13;
on the financial side. Real financial costs remained negative throughout,&#13;
even during the period of positive real interest rates in 1980. Access to&#13;
funds at more subsidized rates than those for the cardboard and ceramic&#13;
producers helped the textile firm weather the competition from imports.&#13;
4. Conclusions&#13;
This paper studied how the economy adjusted to the reform package by examining&#13;
the adjustment experience of nine Argentine firms during 1976-81. The&#13;
description of the macroeconomic environment revealed great volatility in&#13;
financial costs and relative prices, an appreciating real exchange rate during&#13;
the last two years of the reforms and a number of policy reversals and&#13;
inconsistencies. The appreciation of the real exchange rate was linked to the&#13;
use of the exchange rate as an anti-inflationary tool and to redundant&#13;
protection. Volatility in financial costs was accompanied by opportunities&#13;
for lucrative financial arbitrage. For the manufacturing sector, the reforms&#13;
appear to have affected only a group of industries because of initial&#13;
redundant protection and, in some cases, quantitative restrictions. But it&#13;
appears that excess protection was eliminated by early 1979 and that a group&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
of sectors had to cut employment drastically in the face of external&#13;
competition and falling demand.&#13;
The examination of financial statements for three firms in our sample&#13;
revealed that the reforms created opportunities for nonoperating earnings,&#13;
thereby confirming results for a larger sample from Pletrei and Tybout&#13;
(1984). The interviews indicated that managers devoted increasing time to&#13;
firm financial management, and the figures show that these firms were able to&#13;
offset declining operating earnings by borrowing in dollars at highly negative&#13;
real interest rates. Only one of the three firms experienced positive&#13;
financial costs after the 1981 devaluations, suggesting that it did not take&#13;
advantage of the exchange insurance program.&#13;
Our interviews, along with scores on a questionnaire, suggest that&#13;
managers greeted the reforms with considerable skepticism. Almost all&#13;
reported that they adopted a wait-and-see attitude after the announcement of&#13;
reforms, often delaying action for several months. Not surprisingly, the&#13;
interviewees expressed (with hindsight) that by 1980 they were convinced that&#13;
the use of the exchange rate to fight inflationary expectations would be&#13;
sooner or later abandoned.&#13;
Despite this cautious attitude of entrepreneurs, our interviewees&#13;
revealed that important adjustments -- some along the lines intended by the&#13;
reforms -- indeed took place. Chief among these was a move to increase&#13;
product quality, often made possible by acquiring foreign know-how in the&#13;
blueprints for new or existing products.&#13;
The case studies also suggest that the reforms resulted in greater&#13;
industrial concentration, as in Chile and Uruguay. Several firms in our&#13;
sample also increased their vertical integration during the period. The&#13;
increase in concentration was prompted both by foreign competition and by the&#13;

working of the financial system. Financial groups which controlled some large&#13;
banks and had an important participation in industrial firms found the&#13;
resources to purchase additional shares. These financial groups, thus,&#13;
appeared to have acquired control of several sectors by these financial&#13;
operations. In our sample two firms experienced a change of ownership as part&#13;
of those financial operations and three firms interviewed Ihad interlocking&#13;
directorates with large banks.&#13;

APPENDIX:&#13;
Brief Description of Firms Surveyed&#13;
Firm A is a medium-size firm owned by an Argentine family. Specializing in&#13;
animal feed machinery (mills, grass-packing, and combine accessories) and to a&#13;
lesser extent in road-construction machinery, its production is mainly&#13;
oriented to the domestic market.  This firm has fewer than five competitors&#13;
and concentrates on three products, which account for 75 percent of total&#13;
sales. Before the reforms, competing imports were not important, and the&#13;
firm's products had tariff protection of between 0 and 50 percent.&#13;
The firm's sales declined because of foreign competition and the&#13;
reduced market for agricultural machinery. The peso appreciation reduced&#13;
agricultural margins and discouraged investment. The main strategy of this&#13;
firm was to postpone investments and wait for a more favorable environment.&#13;
The interviews also revealed that the peso appreciation knocked it out of the&#13;
markets it had developed for its products in other Latin American countries.&#13;
The firm minimized layoffs because of very good relations between owners and&#13;
personnel, something typical of a medium-size firm outside at big urban center.&#13;
Firm B is a large firm producing paper products almost entirely for&#13;
the domestic market. Its main products are white paper, brown paper, and&#13;
corrugated cardboard. Organized as a corporaticn, the firm is owned and&#13;
managed by a local family. During the reforms, the managers undertook several&#13;
important initiatives, particularly vertical integration by acquiring firms&#13;
producing pulp. These acquisitions were made possible by access to credit at&#13;
favorable terms.&#13;
When firm B acquired other plants, it made long-term arrangements to&#13;
supply specific products to other firms, particularly for packaging and for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
final goods. The firm shifted from production and wholesaling to retailing&#13;
and supporting a network of retailers. PreviousLy engaged only in wholesaling,&#13;
the firm felt that arrangements for retailing it:s products was not&#13;
effective. So it took the opportunity offered by the reforms to engage in&#13;
this new activity. Pricing and marketing, not crucial before the reforms,&#13;
became increasingly important after 1978.&#13;
Firm C is a medium size, import-competing firm which produces&#13;
relatively high technology products. Owned and managed by an Argentine&#13;
family, its main products are hydraulic and oil hydraulic pumps and related&#13;
accessories for road construction, building construction, and agricultural and&#13;
industrial machinery -- all sold almost entirely in the domestic market with&#13;
small amounts of imported intermediate inputs. Its products had a nominal&#13;
protection rate of between 50 percent and 100 percent derived only from&#13;
tariffs.&#13;
The firm's short-run strategy was to turn from producer to&#13;
importer. Thus the firm ceased manufacturing somne products, and turned&#13;
towards importing products that were similar to those it had manufactured in&#13;
the past. Judging that the exchange rate overvaLuation was a temporary&#13;
phenomenon, the firm started to import products i-rom a foreign firm under an&#13;
exclusive right agreement to import, but at the same time included provisions&#13;
to acquire know-how for production of similar ancd related imported goods. The&#13;
acquisition of know-how meant the acquisition of blueprints that could be&#13;
adapted to the machinery (pumps) the firm was already producing. During the&#13;
period of the peso overvaluation, the firm had tc adjust its marketing and&#13;
pricing strategy, reducing its gross margins. As the exchange rate changed in&#13;
1981, the firm stopped importing and started producing forklifts under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
license. Managers also started discussions for producing parts for the same&#13;
foreign firm from which it was buying.&#13;
For other decisions, managers took a long-run view.. Despite rela-&#13;
tively modern technology already in use, firm C had plans to modernize its&#13;
plant. But these plans were abandoned after the government's policy reforms&#13;
increased financial costs and eroded the market prospects. Trade reforms&#13;
occurred at a time when the firm was already engaged in a suibstantial&#13;
transformation. The firm went ahead with part of its original plan but&#13;
canceled the major part. On visit to the plant in late 1979, one of the&#13;
authors was told by the manager that the plant was "going to be opened to Ibe&#13;
closed."&#13;
Firm D is large and produces mainly vitreous china, ceramic and&#13;
enamel steel and bath fixtures, as well as enamel pots, cast iron tubes and&#13;
enamel chemical components. The firm now belongs to a financial group that&#13;
underwent several changes during 1976-81. The new financial system brought&#13;
about by the reforms was instrumental in the takeover by a financial group&#13;
from previous shareholders because of financial difficulty unrelated to the&#13;
firm's performance. The firm produces mainly for the domestic market, where&#13;
it enjoys a dominant position. The firm supplies a substantial proportion of&#13;
the total market for its products and had nominal levels of protection of&#13;
around 50 percent. Most of its activities are linked to fluctuations in&#13;
housing construction. Despite increasing competition from abroad, the firm&#13;
maintained its market share thanks to innovations induced by the reforms in&#13;
the form of the acquisition and development of technology, mainly, by&#13;
importing technology to manufacture enamel products.&#13;
As it now stands, firm D is the result of an evolution which started&#13;
at the beginning of the century. According to executives of the firm, its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
industrial plant is one of the largest and most modern in the world. The firm&#13;
was gradually substituting national material for imported ones and now&#13;
practically all mineral inputs are of domestic origin. During the reform&#13;
period, the firm absorbed other plant-. Among them, the merger with a cast&#13;
iron tube plant gave the firm the possibility of greater vertical integration&#13;
in its traditional line of production. The merger also enabled diversifica-&#13;
tion in production. Before the mergers and other acquisitions, its principal&#13;
product represented 72 percent of total sales.&#13;
Firm E is a large import-competing firm producing textiles and&#13;
plastic products. Major products include texti:Le and plastic shoes, popular&#13;
clothes and material for clothing. The firm participates in related textile&#13;
business in Brazil and Uruguay. During 1976-81 the firm started several new&#13;
investment projects, including several plants operated as subsidiaries, in the&#13;
interior of the country. The experience gained in building industrial plants&#13;
and setting up new industrial processes led the firm to organize a subsidiary&#13;
offering technical services for investment projects. In recent years the firm&#13;
diversified investments to other areas such as fishing and oil extraction.&#13;
The firm has a long history of achievements in Argentina, has always been a&#13;
leader in its product lines, and has pursued continuous innovations in&#13;
marketing.&#13;
Firm F is a medium-size, import-competing firm producing soap&#13;
products of different types. With a dominant position, the firm has been in&#13;
the market over 50 years. During the reform period, it added a new line of&#13;
cosmetic products, later discontinued. Earlier, the firm produced soap for&#13;
various distributors. Around 1978, in the face of declining sales, the mana-&#13;
gers decided to change their marketing strategy and mnounted a commercial orga-&#13;
nization to sell directly to retailers. The reforms thus incited the firm to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
move from an undifferentiated to a differentiated product. But, as financial&#13;
difficulties developed, the firm turned back to previous marketing practice.&#13;
The firm made substantial investments in the first years of the reforms, but&#13;
in 1979 it had to discontinue expansion plans. As was the case for firm D,&#13;
firm F could not pay financial charges in 1979 and was taken over by a&#13;
financial group. When the financial group ran into trouble later on, the firm&#13;
ended up under the supervision of financial authorities.&#13;
Firm G is a large firm, owned by an Argentine family. Producing&#13;
edible vegetable oil and animal feeds mainly from peanut, soja, and sunflower,&#13;
almost all its production is sold abroad. The firm was founded in 1948 with&#13;
an oil processing plant of 35-ton daily capacity in Cordoba province. A new&#13;
plant was opened in 1975 in the heart of the oil-seed producing region of&#13;
Santa Fe province. Expansions of the original plant increased the capacity to&#13;
2,000 tons a day. During the reforms, the firm added a sophisticated peanut&#13;
processing facility to export candy peanuts. Easier access to foreign know-&#13;
how and capital equipment made it possible for the firm to build the plant.&#13;
Finally, the firm owns important facilities in the port of Rosario for its&#13;
export operations.&#13;
Firm G is the only export-oriented firm in our sample. Interest-&#13;
ingly, the firm was not much affected by the overvaluation of the peso and&#13;
managed to continue exporting throughout the reform period.  In fact, the&#13;
reforms benefited the firm in two respects. First, as described above, the&#13;
firm's plants were modernized. Second, the opening of financial markets&#13;
helped its export operations. This occurred because the firm now had access&#13;
to the credit facilities of foreign banks. Before the reforms, credit&#13;
channels with foreign banks were very hard to obtain.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
Firm H produces earth-moving equipment under a license agreement with&#13;
an Italian firm. The firm is owned by a local faraily. Before 1976 the firm&#13;
was exporting more than 20 percent of its production, but during the&#13;
liberalization period the firm experienced a severe decline in its sales&#13;
because of a combination of circumstances akin to those faced by firm A.&#13;
Protection was between 0 and 50 percent. The reforms reduced tariffs on&#13;
imports of capital goods similar to those produced by the firm. Combined with&#13;
the overvaluation of the peso, tariff reductions led to a large reduction in&#13;
demand for the firms' product.&#13;
Despite the adverse shocks from the reforms, firm H remained open&#13;
throughout the reform period. Several factors helped the firm overcome the&#13;
reduction in demand for its product. To begin with, it had a strong financial&#13;
position before to the reforms. Furthermore, the firm dominated the market&#13;
and its main domestic competitor was forced to close. Finally, the firm,&#13;
dependent on public works, could count on that source of demand for its&#13;
products. But the firm also survived thanks to its short-run strategy. Like&#13;
the hydraulic pump producer, firm H turred away from production towards&#13;
importing equipment similar to that which it produced. But since the maxi-&#13;
devatuations of 1983, the firm has regained its previous production level. In&#13;
fact it is exporting practically all of its production to Andean countries.&#13;
Firm I is the largest candy producer in Argentina and probably the&#13;
the world, originally entirely owned and controlled by an Argentine family.&#13;
Later on, nonfamily shareholders acquired ownership with the family still the&#13;
majority shareholder. This firm has a high degree of vertical integration and&#13;
a well-organized distribution network. The firm, mostly supplying the&#13;
domestic market, did not suffer much from external competition. It was in a&#13;
good market position before the reforms, and it had a solid financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
position. (It has a protection rate between 0 and 50 percent.) Nevertheless,&#13;
sales abroad declined markedly. To maintain part of its exports during the&#13;
1979-80 period of peso overvaluation, the firm had to operate with very small&#13;
margins.&#13;
The vertical integration is so great that firm I produces machinery&#13;
to make candies and has its own plant of wrapping paper and also controls its&#13;
milk production. This vertical integration which may appear excessive can be&#13;
partly explained by the firm's president's views about obstacles to growth.&#13;
The president told us that export growth has been slowed by policy-induced&#13;
distortions that raised the cost of inputs. To overcome theses distortions the&#13;
firm has made decisions leading to vertical integration. Examples are&#13;
investments to produce wrapping paper and to develop a sugar substitute&#13;
(fructuosa) to overcome the high cost of sugar caused by protection of&#13;
domestic sugar production.&#13;
Firm I is a leader in technology adoption and has often pursued&#13;
aggressive pricing strategies to increase its market share. With 600&#13;
distributors scattered across the country, the firm also benefits from a well-&#13;
developed distribution network. And with a dominant market position, the firm&#13;
reacted to policy changes with no delay.&#13;

The protection of Chilean manufacturing began after the Great Depression and&#13;
gradually increased after World War II. A first attempt toc reduce excessive&#13;
protection was made at the end of the 1960s. But in the early 1970s nontariff&#13;
protection was stepped up, state takeovers of firms became! widespread, and&#13;
extensive price controls were introduced.  In these circumstances any&#13;
quantitative measure of protectionism becomes dubious, but the protection of&#13;
manufacturing in Chile was unquestionably high and very dilferentiated by late&#13;
1974. Chile's recent experience with the liberalization of foreign trade thus&#13;
provides an unique case study because of the high and differentiated&#13;
protection before the reforms and the effects of the rapid liberalization and.&#13;
final structure of protection. That experience is therefore of great interest&#13;
-- not only for Chile but also for other countries wishing to implement a&#13;
trade liberalization.&#13;
In this paper we analyze the adjustment of industrial firms to the&#13;
liberalization and stabilization reforms in Chile in the second half of the&#13;
1970s. We distinguish actions and policies that helped the adjustment from&#13;
ones that presented obstacles, and identify the various forms of this&#13;
adjustment. Our data came from a qualitative questionnaire completed by 10&#13;
firms. We know that we cannot make broad inferences from such a limited,&#13;
nonrandom sample, but we believe that if the results are consistent with&#13;
expectations, they may be valid for more than the 10 cases studied. Because&#13;
history never provides "pure" experiments, some allowances must be made for&#13;

other factors that could have affected the performance of Chilean firms. That&#13;
is why we asked firms about the origin and intensi.y of other shocks to the&#13;
firms during the liberalization episode.&#13;
Section 1 summarizes the major macroeconolmic developments during the&#13;
period of liberalization. Section 2 describes the evolution of the&#13;
manufacturing sector during the reform period. Section 3 spells out the main&#13;
hypothesis about the expected evolution of firms. In section 4 we discuss the&#13;
chief exogenous factors affecting the firms, the reactions of the firms to&#13;
those factors, and the adjustments that firms macde in their operations. The&#13;
last section presents the main conclusions. The appendix describes briefly&#13;
the firms interviewed.&#13;
1. The Macroeconomic Setting&#13;
The military government that took power in 1973 implemented one of the most&#13;
sweeping economic reforms in Chile's history. The thrust of the policy&#13;
reforms was to allow market forces to allocate resources and distribute goods&#13;
and services. The reforms had five main elements. First, goods markets were&#13;
liberalized by dismantling the protection system and eliminating widespread&#13;
price controls. Second, the financial markets were deregulated. Third, in&#13;
the initial years of the new government, there was a de facto deregulation of&#13;
the labor market due to the trade union's loss of power. Fourth, a price&#13;
stabilization program was introduced, eradicating a chronic fiscal deficit.&#13;
Fifth, there was an overall reduction in government intervention in economic&#13;
activities. The formulation and implementation of these reforms developed&#13;
with time and were adapted to take external events; into account.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
During its first two years in office the new government concentrated&#13;
on reducing the fiscal deficit and on liberalizing prices aLnd eliminating&#13;
nontariff trade restrictions. Some preliminary allowances with respect to the&#13;
existing law regulating the domestic financial markets were also introduced.&#13;
Another major initial goal, the reduction of inflation (around 1,000 percent a&#13;
year in late 1973), was closely related to the fiscal deficit (25 percent of&#13;
GDP in 1973). To reduce this deficit, the tax system was reformed in 1974,&#13;
and government expenditures were drastically reduced.&#13;
In late 1974 and early 1975, when international capital markets were&#13;
practically closed for Chile, copper prices were cut almost in half and the&#13;
price of oil quadrupled. This crisis forced the government to begin to open&#13;
the economy and to devalue the peso. The opening of commodity trade emerged&#13;
as one of the central reforms. After the dismantling of quantitative&#13;
restrictions, explicit tariffs (the only trade barriers) were to be reduced to&#13;
no more than 60 percent. Then, in 1975, a tariff structure with rates ranging&#13;
from 10 to 35 percent was announced. Later, the objective changed, and a&#13;
uniform 10 percent nominal tariff rate was in place in June 1979 (except for&#13;
motor vehicles with engines above 850 cc). The opening of the economy to&#13;
international capital flows started later.&#13;
Because of the fiscal crunch of the price stabilization effort and&#13;
the severe external shocks, Chile's CDP dropped 12.9 percent in 1975. But&#13;
starting from that low level, Chile during 1976-80 had one of its best periods&#13;
of GDP growth ever. This performance was helped by a "realistic" real&#13;
exchange rate and by the dismantling of innumerable government controls across&#13;
all markets. Up to this time inflation had been fought by controlling the&#13;
growth of the money supply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
By early 1978 the government became increasingly concerned with the&#13;
stubbornness of inflation -- at 2.5 percent a month. Indeed, the government&#13;
authorities started to use the exchange rate as the main instrument to reduce&#13;
inflation. The implicit model of inflation was that of an open economy in&#13;
which domestic inflation is closely guided by inLternational inflation and the&#13;
rate of devaluation. It was also thought that the rate of devaluation had an&#13;
important effect on inflationary expectations. Until February 1978 the rate&#13;
of devaluation was linked to the trade liberalization and the evolution of the&#13;
current account as well as the difference between domestic and foreign&#13;
inflation. Then the system was abandoned in favor of an active crawling peg&#13;
system (a tablita). That system announced, up to the end of 1978,&#13;
devaluations at a decreasing rate starting with a monthly rate of 2.5 percent&#13;
and ending with one of 0.75 percent. The subsequent peso appreciation reduced&#13;
the real exchange rate, and the import-competing and export-oriented sectors&#13;
started to suffer. Thus, a contradiction started to appear between the trade&#13;
liberalizaton and the price stabilization.&#13;
In June 1979 the peso was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a fixed&#13;
rate. Chilean inflation was still substantially above international levels,&#13;
so the real appreciation of the peso continued. Furthermore, wage indexation&#13;
based on lagged changes in the CPI resulted in a period of decreasing&#13;
inflation, in large increases in real wages, thus worsening the peso&#13;
appreciation. The final consequence was a large erosion in competitiveness, a&#13;
very weak commercial account in the balance of payments, and heavy external&#13;
borrowing. Indeed, the peso appreciation was a second and more intensive&#13;
trade liberalization. Paradoxically, the large increase in capital inflows&#13;
that resulted from the lifting of controls as well as from the new exchange&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
rate policy made the exchange rate policy temporarily sustainable at the same&#13;
time as it caused the loss in competitiveness.&#13;
Monetary policy, once central to macroeconomic strategy, became less&#13;
important with time. In the first years of the military government, a major&#13;
source of money growth was the financing of the government deficit. But after&#13;
the deficit was reduced by the fiscal reforms of 1974-75, the expansion in&#13;
domestic credit lost substantial ground to exchange rate operations. While&#13;
the domestic credit component of the money base was declining during the late&#13;
1970s, the exchange rate operations were highly expansionary, as the central&#13;
bank was accumulating reserves (table 3-1). The money supply (Ml) grew 67&#13;
percent in 1978, 65 percent in 1979, 59 percent in 1980, and 9 percent in&#13;
1981. But in 1982, it fell roughly 19 percent.&#13;
The official view -- that of the central bank -- was that the money&#13;
supply was demand-determined along a monetary model of the balance of&#13;
payments. But other economists, mostly in the private sector, believed that&#13;
the money supply continued to be determined by the actions of the central&#13;
bank. A recent study (Corbo and Matte 1984) shows that neither group had&#13;
wholly missed the point. The monetary authority had some control over the&#13;
money supply, control that could have been used to neutralize part of the&#13;
monetary effect of the capital inflows.&#13;
Finally, the drastic reduction in external funding and the impact of&#13;
the world recession induced a large domestic recession in 1982. Furthermore,&#13;
the ptso appreciation accumulated in the preceding three years had become&#13;
incompatible with the reduced capital inflows. At first, the government tried&#13;
a recession-caused deflation to adjust the economy to this Large reduction in&#13;
capital inflows and export receipts. The downward inflexibility of prices did&#13;
not permit the necessary adjustments, however, causing the recession to deepen&#13;

and financial sector to weaken even further. Because competitiveness did not&#13;
recuperate and the world recession continued, the unemployment rate increased&#13;
sharply (from 11 percent in March 1981 to 25 percent in June 1982). The&#13;
number of bankrupt firms also increased substantially. By the middle of 1982,&#13;
the government decided to implement macroeconomic policies that would help the&#13;
adjustment and reduce unemployment. The main policies were to abandon the&#13;
fixed exchange rate and to suspend wage indexation.&#13;
How were the main macroeconomic variables evolving during all this?&#13;
The average rate of growth of GDP, after running at 7.5 percent during 1976-&#13;
80, slowed to 5.3 percent in 1981, and turned negative in 1982, when GDP fell&#13;
14.3 percent (table 3-2). The fastest growing sectors were the nontradable&#13;
ones (construction, commerce, and other services). Supported by the high&#13;
level of capital inflows, total domestic expenditures (private consumption&#13;
plus government consumption and investment) grew 10.9 percent a year in&#13;
constant prices during 1977-81. The faster increases in domestic expenditures&#13;
than in GDP were linked to a growing deficit in the current account of the&#13;
balance of payments. Moving from a surplus in 1976, this deficit was 7.1&#13;
percent of GDP in 1980 and 14.1 percent in 1981.&#13;
2. The Manufacturing Sector during 1973-82&#13;
The gross value of production for the manufacturing sector grew 2.1 percent a&#13;
year in the 1970s, compared with 5.5 percent in the 1960s. Manufacturing GDP&#13;
meanwhile grew 2.8 percent a year during the 1970s and 4.3 percent during the&#13;
1960s. As a result, the share of manufacturing in GDP fell from 25.4 percent&#13;
in 1970 to 21.5 percent in 1980. The sectors whose production increased most&#13;
during the 1970s were paper and paper products, petroleum refining, plastic&#13;

products, machinery and electrical appliances, and tobacco. Amonlg the sectors&#13;
whose production decreased most were glass products, transport material, and&#13;
products derived from petroleum and coal (see table 3-3). The sectors that&#13;
most improved their share in the gross value of industrial production were&#13;
food, steel and iron, wood, and petroleum refineries. The ones whose shares&#13;
diminished the most were textiles, wearing apparel (except footwear), rubber&#13;
products, and electrical and nonelectrical machinery. The industrial&#13;
production index from the National Statistical Institute shows that production&#13;
kept growing in 1980 and then sharply declined during 1981 and 1'382.&#13;
A fall in employment paralleled the decline in production. The&#13;
number of people employed in manufacturing fell 4.9 percent between 1967 and&#13;
1979, with the biggest drop in establishments employing more tharL 50 people.&#13;
This reduction in employment and the modest increase in production imply an&#13;
increase in average labor productivity during these years. For some sectors&#13;
the reduction of labor employed was considerable: 37 percent in metal&#13;
products, machinery, and equipment and 23 percent in ISIC sector 39, other&#13;
manufacturing industries. In the textile and clothing sector th,e labor&#13;
employed fell 13 percent. The two sectors that showed the greatiest increase&#13;
in the number of people employed were food, drinks, and tobacco and paper,&#13;
paper products, and publishing: the growth was 19 percent for both sectors.&#13;
The number of establishments fell 13 percent between the two census&#13;
years. The fall was mainly in small establishments (employing between five&#13;
and nine persons) which decreased in number by 18.9 percent. The number of&#13;
large establishments (with 50 and more employees) was roughly the same in 1979&#13;
as in 1967.&#13;
Real wages in the manufacturing sector played a significant role in&#13;
the performance of firms during the reform period. Real wages never reached&#13;

their 1970 level, although they increased sharply from the very low base of&#13;
1975 (table 3-4). The drop in real wages during 1973-75 helped the firms&#13;
adjust to the implementation of the reforms. The ensuing recovery in real&#13;
wages hurt firms in the years of the peso appreciation. Labor costs continued&#13;
to increase, but producers could not pass the increases onto prices because&#13;
foreign competition was much more keen.&#13;
3. The Main Reforms and Their Expected Impact&#13;
in the Manufacturing Sector&#13;
The reform began with the dismantling of quantitative restrictions and then&#13;
with tariff reductions. The latter were larger for the higher nominal&#13;
tariffs. In September 1973 the tariffs had ranged up to 750 percent. The&#13;
average weighted tariff was 105 percent, the tariff mode 90 percent. By July&#13;
1975 the maximum tariff had been reduced to 120 percent, the average weighted&#13;
tariff to 57 percent. In a second stage, a tariff target was defined with six&#13;
nominal tariffs ranging between 10 and 35 percent, a target achieved in August&#13;
1977. During this phase the average weighted tariff fell to 20 percent. The&#13;
last stage consisted of gradual tariff reductions that ended in June 1979 with&#13;
a uniform tariff of 10 percent (except for motor vehicles). The reforms also&#13;
removed all nontariff barriers.&#13;
In 1974 the average annual nominal tariffs in the manutfacturing&#13;
sector ranged between 32 percent and 185 percent. The highest tariff was for&#13;
clothing, the lowest for nonmetallic mineral products (Aedo and Lagos 1984).&#13;
The clothing sector suffered the largest reduction in its nominal tariff in&#13;
1974-75 (45 percent) but kept the highest nominal tariff during the reforms&#13;
(excluding motor vehicles).  The smallest tariff reduction in the first stage&#13;

of the reform was 19 percent, for nonelectrical machinery.   For such sectors&#13;
as clothing, textiles, leather, footwear, glass, printing, and beverages, the&#13;
tariff reductions implied a fall in the nominal tariff rate of 90 percent in&#13;
six years.&#13;
Some of these sectors had negative effective protection before the&#13;
reform: an example is printing and publishing. Others, such as textiles,&#13;
petroleum and coal products, and electrical machinery, had the. highest&#13;
effective protection rates (Corbo and Meller 1981). In 1974 the average&#13;
effective tariff protection was close to that in 1967 although its variability&#13;
had reduced substantially. From 1974 on, effective tariff rates decreased&#13;
continuously in every sector except petroleum and coal products (see table 3-&#13;
5). As a result, the average effective rate for domestic sales went down from&#13;
151 percent in 1974 to 14 percent in 1979. As there was much tariff&#13;
redundancy in the early years, the decrease in overall protection should be&#13;
less than the above figures show.&#13;
Another important set of reforms were directed at the liberalization&#13;
of prices. 1/ Chile used extensive price controls -- to suppress inflation&#13;
and redistribute income.   In September 1973 the Direccion de Endustria y&#13;
Comercio (DIRINCO) controlled more than 3,000 prices. In October these&#13;
controls were eliminated (one of the first reforms of the military government)&#13;
under law decree no. 522, which defined three groups of goods and services:&#13;
(1)       Those whose prices were to be freely determined by producers and&#13;
importers.&#13;

(2)       Those whose prices were still to be fixed (33 items).&#13;
(3)       Those whose prices were to be informed -- that is, these prices&#13;
were not controlled, but DIRINCO reserved the (rarely exercised)&#13;
right to reject them (18 informed-price goods).&#13;
Among the industrial products whose prices were fixed were bread,&#13;
flour, sugar, oil, tea, milk, simple pastas and processed food, all of them in&#13;
the food sector. Other industrial goods subject to price controls were steel&#13;
and copper tubes,-sanitary articles, paper, matches, tires, cigarettes, motor&#13;
vehicles, detergents, television sets, and liquid gas containers and their&#13;
valves.&#13;
On the informed price list were pharmaceutical products, plane&#13;
glasses for construction, lubricants, vehicle replacement parts, shoes,&#13;
processed cement products, white goods, nails and wire, tableware and alumi-&#13;
nium receptacles, materials for handicraft, instant coffee, toiletries,&#13;
electronic products, beer, pens, glass bottles, and school uniforms. In&#13;
December 1980 a new decree law established that informed-price goods could n,ot&#13;
be returned to the list of fixed prices and that the freely priced ones could&#13;
not be returned to either the fixed or informed list.&#13;
The third important set of reforms affected the financial markets.&#13;
Before the reforms the financial sector had three main features.  The first&#13;
was government ownership of the main share of the banking system. The second&#13;
was nominal interest rate control that, coupled with high inflation, led to a&#13;
negative real rate and a variety of quantitative restrictions for credit&#13;
rationing. The third was highly restricted inflows of private capital. The&#13;
liberalization of this sector was in two stages. During the first stage,&#13;
internal market reforms consisted mainly of gradually eliminating controls on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the nominal interest rate and privatizing the government-owned banks. The&#13;
first decontrol of interest rates was fully achieved in October 1975, after&#13;
which the real interest rate moved to high positive levels. Annual real rates&#13;
of 30 percent for domestic currency loans were usual during 1975-82.&#13;
During the second stage, international market reforms consisted&#13;
mainly of gradually opening the capital account for private inflows. This&#13;
process started in September 1977, when commercial banks were allowed to use&#13;
article 14 of the exchange law for their capital inflows, although&#13;
quantitative restrictions persisted for international borrowing. (Article 14&#13;
gave the borrower the right of access to the exchange rate market to serve&#13;
foreign debt.) In June 1979 the global limits for commercial bank borrowing&#13;
were eliminated, and in April 1980 all quantitative restrictions on external&#13;
borrowing under article 14 were eliminated. Only two restrictions were&#13;
maintained: a limit on overall borrowing; a reserve requirement on external&#13;
borrowing that depended on the maturity of loans. Firms could also borrow in&#13;
the external market under article 14. This situation, coupled with the high&#13;
real interest rate in the internal market and the low cost of foreign&#13;
borrowing during the past February 1978 period, made it worthwhile for firms&#13;
with access to external financial markets to engage in internal private&#13;
lending.&#13;
As the result of the foregoing reforms, firms had to react to a&#13;
series of exogenous factors if they were to maintain their profitability. In&#13;
the manufacturing sector, we would expect the following effects on firms, with&#13;
differences depending mainly on the market orientation of their sales:&#13;
(1)       Import-competing firms in highly protected sectors would have&#13;
the prices of their output drop between L976 and 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
(2)       Export-oriented firms would benefit from the large devaluation&#13;
of 1974-75 and from the tariff reductions for some of their&#13;
inputs.&#13;
(3)       Both export-oriented and import-competing lfirms would suffer&#13;
from the peso appreciation during 1980-82. But due to the&#13;
favorable evolution of the terms of trade, export-oriented&#13;
firms, would begin to feel the loss of competitiveness only in&#13;
late 1980.&#13;
(4)       Import-competing firms would suffer during 1982 due to the sharp&#13;
domestic recession.&#13;
Because the liberalization of trade and the deregulation of domestic&#13;
prices directly affects the sales prices of goods and the price of&#13;
intermediate inputs, the reaction of profit-maximizing firms should have been&#13;
to change the structure of goods produced (including their quality) and the&#13;
structure of inputs used. If the primary raw material inputs have low&#13;
substitution elasticity, the bulk of the adjustment in inputs should have been&#13;
through a change in employment (the main variable input). The deterioration&#13;
in the real exchange rate after February 1977 and especially after June 1979&#13;
should have intensified the adjustments in the import-competing and exporting&#13;
firms. These adjustments were complicated by the rises in real wages due to&#13;
backward wage indexation in a period of declining inflation.&#13;
4. How Firms Assessed the Shocks and Adjusted Their Operations&#13;
The interviews were held between August 1982 and August 1983, when the reforms&#13;
were already in place and Chile's economy was suffering from a severe&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
recession. The sample included ten firms: two corporations belonging to&#13;
family groups, five national companies linked to economic conglomerates, and&#13;
three multinational subsidiaries -- in one of these, local shareholders have a&#13;
small holding (table 3-6). The reason for select:ing these firms was to&#13;
include firms with different trade orientations and different levels of&#13;
protection on the eve of the reforms. In the textile sector we selected two&#13;
firms (one that did very well and one that went bankrtupt) because this was one&#13;
of the sectors that was supposed to suffer the sharpest adjustment. As for&#13;
the orientation of trade, one firm exported its entire production; two others&#13;
sold some of their production domestically and exported the rest, 50 percent&#13;
in one case and 30 percent in the other. The other seven firms were basically&#13;
oriented toward the domestic market, although some of them made occasional&#13;
attempts at exports.&#13;
Three of the firms manufacture products that previously were highly&#13;
protected, with effective protection exceeding 95 percent. The effective&#13;
protection of five firms was less than 30 percent. And for the remaining two&#13;
it was in between. All the firms interviewed were founded long before the&#13;
reforms were implemented, although one resulted from a merger of the two&#13;
largest companies in the sector during the early years of the reforms.&#13;
The Assessment of Shocks&#13;
The firms ranked 25 shocks, marking 0 if it was not applicable, 1 if&#13;
it was not significant, 2 if it was somewhat significant, 3 if it was&#13;
significant, and 4 if it was very significant (tables 3-7 and 3-8).&#13;
The most important favorable shock was new labor legislation that&#13;
enabled firms to negotiate wages and working conditions with employees. As&#13;
expected, this factor and the elimination of restrictions on recruitment and&#13;

layoffs had more of an effect after mid-1979, when firms began to feel the&#13;
effects of the appreciation of the peso. Another important favorable factor&#13;
for many firms, especially import-competing firms, was the relaxing of price&#13;
controls. Since the tariffs were initially high, the elimination of price&#13;
controls enabled many firms to design a price structure more in accord with&#13;
their marginal cost of production, thus increasing profits. This deregulation&#13;
occurred at the beginning of the period for the prodlucts of all firms in the&#13;
sample except firm D, whose products were removed from price controls only&#13;
after 1980. A third important factor was the training legislation that&#13;
resulted in lower training costs by giving full tax credits for training&#13;
expenditures of up to 1 percent of the wage bill. Almost all firms&#13;
interviewed said that training was an important part of their strategy for&#13;
improving efficiency. A fourth important factor was greater clarity in the&#13;
rules of the game with the state, except for firm E, which indicated that in&#13;
its sector the rules had been unclear.&#13;
Another favorable factor for the firms was the shutdown of labor&#13;
union activities in the mid-1970s which meant freedom in negotiating wages and&#13;
working conditions. Firm H, for example, previously had commissions of&#13;
employees who reviewed costs, prices, rates, and the like. There was also a&#13;
rate schedule based on time and motion studies (which had to be discussed with&#13;
the commissions). Thus, if a study showed that a specific job took one hour,&#13;
it had to be taken up in discussion with the commission. This changed under&#13;
the reforms. Another example is firm J. Previously, if the firm wanted an&#13;
employee to do a job other than that negotiated, the change had to be approved&#13;
by the labor union. After 1973 it was much easier to move employees from one&#13;
position to another. This internal reallocation of labor was essential for&#13;
the change in output mix calLed for by the change in incentives. Firm E was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 107 -&#13;
again an exception: according to its executives, the labor unions are as&#13;
powerful as ever, even though strikes are no longer used as pressure tactics.&#13;
What is surprising, given the financial reforms during the period, is&#13;
that greater access to working capital was ranked so low. This low ranking&#13;
might reflect a bias in our sample since the firms interviewed are large,&#13;
prestigious companies that never had problems with access to the credit&#13;
market. Also striking is the low importance assigned to the elimination of&#13;
restrictions on the acquisition of foreign know-how and foreign-made machinery&#13;
and equipment. The expLanation is that imported equipment and machinery have&#13;
enjoyed special treatment in the form of low tariffs and preferential exchange&#13;
rates. 1/&#13;
The increase in export possibilities was another favorable factor&#13;
that was rated less significant. Because the exporting firms were already&#13;
exporting before the reforms, the increase in export possibilities did not&#13;
represent a great benefit to them. Of the other, primarily import-competing&#13;
firms, only one tried to export. The attempts were abandoned in 1981, when&#13;
costs in local currency were increasing sharply at a time when the exchange&#13;
rate was fixed. Because the firm could not increase its prices abroad, it&#13;
started to incur heavy losses in this operation.&#13;
The most significant unfavorable factors were the cost of working&#13;
capital, which rose throughout the period, and the unit labor cost, which rose&#13;
more rapidly than product prices from 1979 to 1981. For import-competing&#13;
firms, the main unfavorable shock was an increase in foreign competition,&#13;
owing first to a reduction in import restrictions beginning in 1976, next to&#13;
1/ See Torres (1982) for a description of the special tariff treatment for&#13;
capital goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 108 -&#13;
the appreciation of the peso in 1979, and then to the fall in international&#13;
prices in 1981.&#13;
The Firms' Perceptions of Shocks&#13;
In general, all the firms reacted promptly to the announcement that&#13;
tariffs would be between 10 and 35 percent, but only firm A believed that&#13;
tariffs would fall as low as 10 percent. The typical response was a drastic&#13;
reduction in costs through streamlining production. The fixing of the&#13;
exchange rate in June 1979 and the subsequent appreciation of the peso also&#13;
sharpened foreign competition, placing firms that deal in tradable goods in a&#13;
difficult position. None of the 10 firms initially believed, however, that&#13;
the exchange rate would be maintained. They therefore preferred to borrow in&#13;
pesos rather than in dollars, at a time when i:he ex-post interest rate was&#13;
substantially higher for peso borrowing. An example of this is provided by&#13;
the multinational companies in the sample: two of them received instructions&#13;
from the parent firm not to borrow in dollars because of the risk of&#13;
devaluation. After some time, the local office began to try to persuade the&#13;
parent firm that the exchange rate would be maintained since the authorities&#13;
repeatedly claimed that the peso would not be devalued. In early 1982 the&#13;
parent firms began to have faith in the fixed exchange rate and reversed their&#13;
original orders. In June that year the peso was devalued.&#13;
Apparently, the firms' expectations that the peso would be devalued&#13;
were cyclical. Initially these expectations were very high. Then they&#13;
declined, only to rise again in late 1981 and early 1982, except for firms F,&#13;
C, and H. These firms, acting on expectations generated by the authorities,&#13;
transferred their borrowings to dollars and at the time of the devaluation had&#13;
all their debt denominated in dollars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 109 -&#13;
About the time taken to react to these exogenous factors, two firms&#13;
referred to the costs implied in implementing measures. For exarnple, firm H,&#13;
which began to replace domestic raw materials with imported raw materials, had&#13;
to learn how to import before it could reap the full advantage oif this new&#13;
benefit provided by the reforms.&#13;
In the opinion of the firms, there were two main contradictions or&#13;
ambiguities. The first was the original announcement that tariffs would be&#13;
between 10 and 35 percent, when the tariff implemented was 10 percent. The&#13;
second was the newly fixed exchange rate, which sparked the appreciation of&#13;
the peso. In addition, firm D felt that a contradiction in economic policy&#13;
was to maintain price controls for such a long time (up to 1980) when foreign&#13;
competition was growing.&#13;
The Adjustments in Operations&#13;
The reforms triggered a series of adjustments by firms to the new&#13;
sets of incentives.  In the questionnaire, we grouped the adjustments into&#13;
four types: labor practices, production strategies, financial acljustments,&#13;
and prices and marketing (table 3-9).&#13;
The major adjustment by the firms in the sample involved labor&#13;
practices, especially after 1979. The most frequent adjustment was a&#13;
reduction in the labor force. This is consistent with the assessment that the&#13;
major favorable shock was the elimination of restrictions on recruJitment and&#13;
layoffs. In 1982 all the firms had smaller staffs than in 1976, having made&#13;
rather deep cuts in employment ranging from 50 percent for the largest firm to&#13;
20 percent for the smallest. The exception was firm E, whose wortk force in&#13;
1982 was 4 percent larger than in 1976. These reductions occurred mainly in&#13;
1981, when the required adjustment was greatest. Another firm, whose&#13;

production was seasonal, replaced half its permanent personnel by seasonal&#13;
workers.&#13;
Almost unanimously, the firms stated that these staff cuts meant&#13;
substantial increases in productivity, even though six of the 10 firms made&#13;
major investments during the period. The figures reported by the firms for&#13;
these increases in productivity are in some cases spectacular. Firm J, a&#13;
textile manufacturer, made heavy investments during the period. Its&#13;
productivity rose from 1,000 meters of cloth per laborer a month in 1976 to&#13;
28,000 meters in 1982. Firm C, the one investing the least during the period,&#13;
had a sevenfold increase in productivity per worker. The driving force behind&#13;
these investments (by import-competing firms) was an attempt to cut costs to&#13;
meet foreign competition. Firm H, for example, indicated that clients would&#13;
tell them how much the imported product would cost to bring in from outside&#13;
and ask how much the firm would charge to produce the same article. This&#13;
forced firm H to make the necessary adjustment to meet that competition.&#13;
In the first phase of the reforms, the main way firms adjusted was to&#13;
change their production strategy. The most significant change mentioned&#13;
involved product quality, particularly among the import competing firms.&#13;
Several indicated that they had never before been concerned with product&#13;
quality. Although in most cases the adjustments to quality wenlt in the&#13;
direction of improvements, one firm had to lower product qualit.y to compete&#13;
with cheap imports. Exporters did not have to alter quality, since they had&#13;
already been producing to international standards before the re!forms,&#13;
For the import-competing firms, changes in the range oE goods&#13;
produced were also ranked high. The trend was to reduce production lines&#13;
strictly to those in which the firms felt that they could compete with&#13;
imports. In many cases, the firms began to import products thaLit were no&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112 -&#13;
longer manufactured domestically. The reasons for this behavior ranged from&#13;
"to maximize use of our distribution network" to "so that other firms won't do&#13;
so." In one case the importing of products was part of a marketing strategy&#13;
to open the market for future domestic production. Only one import-competing&#13;
firm, firm B attempted to export (copper-made goods). To do this it imported&#13;
technology and spent nearly US$300,000 trying to penetrate the U.S. market.&#13;
Begun in 1976, this experiment had to be abandoned in 1980 when the firm could&#13;
not maintain its prices due to rising domestic costs (in dollars).&#13;
The closing of plants by import-competing firms reflects their&#13;
expectations regarding the durability of the import boom. Firms B and D, for&#13;
example, closed plants that were too inefficient to compete with increasing&#13;
imports. Firm H, however, expected that "cheap" imports could not last,&#13;
leading it to enter what it called "the plastic era" of keeping its machinery&#13;
well maintained and covered with plastic, ready to enter into production at&#13;
any moment.&#13;
Inventory management was the other change in production strategy&#13;
irlicated by almost all firms. In a time of high real interest rates the&#13;
I.inancial costs associated with high inventories prompted firms to take&#13;
drastic measures to reduce inventories to as one firm reported, "almost&#13;
dangerous levels."&#13;
Changes in prices and marketing were more significant for the import-&#13;
competing firms than for those dealing in exportables. The reforms imposed&#13;
ceilings on the prices set by import-competing firms. This obliged them to&#13;
base prices primarily on the prices the foreign competitor charged rather than&#13;
on costs. In a complementary study on agricultural exports and agroindustrial&#13;
products, Arriagada (chapter 4, this voLume) found that investment in&#13;
marketing was minor for exporting firms. Indeed, he found that firms did not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113 -&#13;
invest as much in marketing as would have been expected. Surprisingly,&#13;
domestic competition was not a factor influencing prices before the reforms,&#13;
possibly because of the monopolistic position of those firms at that time.&#13;
Before the reforms and until roughly the end of 1977, the cost of labor was an&#13;
important factor in price setting. From then on, the major factor became&#13;
foreign competition. Although the cost of labor kept rising as; the peso&#13;
appreciated, that cost could not be carried over to prices and thus it mainly&#13;
affected profit rates.&#13;
Careful financial management was crucial to the profitability, even&#13;
the survival, of firms in a period of high interest rates. The most important&#13;
financial strategy for profitability was undoubtedly related to borrowing.&#13;
From 1979 to 1981 there was a considerable difference between the real cost of&#13;
credit in pesos versus that in dollars, which was consistently Lower. Given&#13;
the expectations generated by the authorities, many companies switched from&#13;
borrowing pesos to borrowing dollars. Those companies had lower financial&#13;
costs as long as the exchange rate was fixed, but they were hit hard by the&#13;
June 1982 devaluation (recall that firms in the sample had borrowings&#13;
denominated entirely in dollars on that date). Borrowing in dcoLlars was not&#13;
the only financial measure of firms, however. The exporting firms, for&#13;
example, juggled advance payments (preembargues) to obtain funds that they&#13;
could invest in the short-term market. And one firm accumulated cash for&#13;
investments in the short-term financial market.&#13;
5. Conclusions&#13;
Firms in the manufacturing sector were affected by two distinct exogenous&#13;
factors. The first was the liberalization of trade during 1975-79. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 114 -&#13;
second was the appreciation of the peso during 1980-82. The main adjustments&#13;
during the liberalization were streamlining the activities of firms, without&#13;
much investment.  The streamlining took the form of reducing production lines,&#13;
closing inefficient plants, reassigning workers, and changing product&#13;
quality. Until 1979 the liberalization of the labor market played a central&#13;
role in the firms' adjustments to the trade liberalization. As a result of&#13;
this streamlining, average labor productivity rose substantially. A second de&#13;
facto trade liberalization accompanied the large peso appreciation during&#13;
1980-82, when firms had no more room for efficiency improvements. The&#13;
recession that started in late 1981 and 1982 compounded the firms' problems.&#13;
An important lesson from these case studies is the central role of&#13;
macroeconomic management in liberalization attempts. With the reduction in&#13;
protection for import-competing firms, there was a substantial release of&#13;
labor (which increased labor productivity in the manufacturing sector). That&#13;
release was not absorbed by other expanding sectors (nontradable and export&#13;
sectors), and caused increasing unemployment. The seconcd important lesson is&#13;
the central role of policies for the exchange rate and foreign borrowing.&#13;
Indeed, the policies followed from 1978 on caused a sharp reduction in the&#13;
relative price of tradables. That reduction reversed the signal, given at the&#13;
beginning of the reforms, to the export-oriented firms. And for the import-&#13;
competing firms it was equivalent to a second, and more intensive, trade&#13;
liberalization that proved very difficult to surmount.&#13;

Appendix: Brief Description of the Firms in the Study&#13;
Firm A, a maker of pulp and paper products, is one of the largest&#13;
private corporations in Chile, with about 3,000 workers. Its exports were&#13;
US$123 million in 1980 and US$90 million in 1981.&#13;
Firm B is a very old family firm but has been a corporation since&#13;
1965. Its main products are pots and kitchen utensils made mainly from&#13;
aluminium. Currently, the firm has 250 workers in two plants.&#13;
Firm C, one of the largest firms in its sector, is a producer of&#13;
stoves, washers, and refrigerators. Formed in 1905, it merged with another&#13;
large firm in 1975. Sales increased from $31 million in 1976 to $85 million&#13;
in 1980, then fell to $80 million in 1981, though with no loss of market&#13;
share.&#13;
Firm D, a multinational with no local holding, has been operating&#13;
since 1982, as a producer of brand-name cleaning products and other goods for&#13;
home use. It is basically oriented to the local market.&#13;
Firm E, an export-oriented business for more than 20 years, is mainly&#13;
in fish oil and meat. It attributes its success to its international&#13;
marketing strategy. Since the 1960s it has belonged to an association of&#13;
local producers that have a common marketing board, which confers benefits of&#13;
pricing power and of economies in freight, insurance, and payments to&#13;
dealers. This firm is part of an economic conglomerate but has no connection&#13;
with the banking sector.&#13;
Firm F produces brand-name food products that are well known by local&#13;
consumers. Founded in 1934, it is mainly a multinational, though it has some&#13;
local holders. The firm has several plants and can be considered one of the&#13;
main producers in its field.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117 -&#13;
Firm G, a corporation founded more than twenty years ago and now&#13;
owned by an economic group and some small shareholders, produces food&#13;
products. Oriented to local and foreign markets, it specializes in canning,&#13;
preserving fruits and vegetables, and preparing industriaL fo#h the&#13;
corporation as a whole did very well during the reforms, the importance of the&#13;
commercial part and productive parts changed considerably. In particular, the&#13;
commercial branch did very well during the peso appreciation while the&#13;
production branch was working at half capacity.&#13;
Firm I, founded in 1939, was the only firm of the sample that went&#13;
bankrupt during the reforms. Part of an economic conglomierate, its main&#13;
activities were spinning, weaving, and finishing of textiles. This firm was&#13;
taken over during the Allende regime and returned to the owners during the&#13;
first years of the reforms. In 1980 it merged with other firms of the sector&#13;
in an attempt to withstand foreign competition.&#13;
Firm J, the smallest firm in the sample, is a family-owned&#13;
corporation in the textile sector. Unlike other textile firms, it grew during&#13;
the whole period of the reforms. When the interview took place in the middle&#13;
of a major depression, this firm was buying a new plant from a previous&#13;
competitor that had gone bankrupt.&#13;

The Chilean foreign trade reform initiated in 1975 had two basic objectives.&#13;
The first was to solve in the short term the serious balance of payments&#13;
problems affecting the national economy. The second was to launch a neutral&#13;
development strategy that would eliminate the excesses oE the import&#13;
substitution period. There were three principal measures. One was a strong&#13;
currency devaluation and the enforcement of a unified exchange rate for&#13;
imports and exports.  Another was progressive elimination of nontariff&#13;
restrictions. The third was to reduce the 1973 import tariffs to a single 10&#13;
percent tariff in June 1979. The foreign trade reform took place&#13;
simultaneously with a general program of economic stabilization that attacked&#13;
the fiscal problem of high deficits, the main cause of the high inflation&#13;
rates during 1971-75. Initially, the merchandise trade account was&#13;
liberalized while restrictions on the capital account were maintained. The&#13;
intention was first to arrange internal affairs to generate international&#13;
confidence in the Chilean economy and then to secure foreign credits.   Only&#13;
much later were restrictions to capital inflows reduced.&#13;
This study examines the effects of the reforms on exporters of&#13;
agricultural perishables, nonperishables, and canned foods. The following&#13;
conclusions will be supported: First, liberalization took place without&#13;
increasing the export profitability for the agricultural sectors. On the&#13;
This study summarizes some of the main results of the authors' doctoral&#13;

contrary, the profitability of primary exports was very low and even decreased&#13;
for food products.  Second, exports played an important role in agriculture&#13;
due to the introduction of some new products for export markets, such as&#13;
apples and grapes, which are natural-resource-based and do not have many&#13;
marketing requirements. Some other products that require more marketing to&#13;
succeed in foreign markets--canned fruits and canned fish--did not do well&#13;
during the liberalization, despite their higher profit indices. Third, the&#13;
liberalization was not accompanied by a cLear export promotion strategy,&#13;
something that may be crucial for initiating a development strategy based on&#13;
exporting. Instead, liberalization was neutral, still favoring import&#13;
substitution with a 10 percent uniform tariff. Ihe exchange rate responded to&#13;
objectives other than exporting, and its instability ended up damaging serious&#13;
export attempts. And having had an import-substitution strategy in force for&#13;
many years did not ease the transition toward exports for either the&#13;
production structure or the managerial mentality.&#13;
1. Evolution of Tradable and Nontradable Sectors&#13;
At the beginning of the liberalization in 1975 the ratio of tradable goods&#13;
prices to nontradable goods prices was high, reaching its highest value, 1.8,&#13;
in the fourth quarter of 1975, mainly because of the strong currency&#13;
devaluation in that year (table 4-1). The ratio of tradable goods prices to&#13;
wages was also very high, indicating high profitability for the tradable goods&#13;
sector. From 1976 on, the real exchange rate started declining, as is clearly&#13;
seen in the evolution of the tradable to nontradable price ratio, and the&#13;
tradable to wage price ratio. The incentives; for tradable goods were&#13;
decreasing. Before fixing the nominal exchange rate in June 1979, the&#13;

tradable goods sector regained a bit of competitiveness. From then on, until&#13;
the end of 1981, the fall in the real valu(e of the exchange rate was about 30&#13;
percent.&#13;
This real exchange rate evolution shows the change in policy&#13;
objectives during the liberalization. During 1975 the objective was to&#13;
achieve a high real exchange rate to face a balance-of-payments crisis arising&#13;
from the increase in oil prices and the large drop in the price of copper,&#13;
Chile's main exported commodity. At the beginning of 1975 the trade&#13;
liberalization period, the exchange rate was devalued to promote net inflows&#13;
of foreign exchange and to compensate for tarifE reductions.  From 1977 on the&#13;
main objective was economic stabilization. In this period the exchange rate&#13;
was used as one of the main instruments to reduce the inflation, with the&#13;
nominal exchange rate increasing at a decreasing rate.&#13;
Real wages rose substantially for three reasons: backward indexation&#13;
of salaries, sticky prices for nontradable goods, and rapidly decelerating&#13;
inflation (related to the fixing of the exchange rate in the third quarter of&#13;
1979). Between rising real wages and the real exchange rate appreciation that&#13;
also started late in 1979, Chile's tradable sector suffered from dramatically&#13;
reduced international competitiveness. However, competitiveness of&#13;
importables declined before that for exportables.&#13;
The instability of exchange rate policy throughout liberalization, a&#13;
result of different policy objectives, shows that export promotion was not&#13;
uppermost in the minds of policymakers. This may turn out to be a crucial&#13;
point in explaining export responses.&#13;

2. Evolution of Exports during Liberalization&#13;
As the era of import substitution closed around 1971, primary traditional&#13;
products amounted to 85 percent of total exports: copper alone was 73&#13;
percent, followed by traditional manufactured products at 6.9 percent (table&#13;
4-2) of which fish meal accounted for nearly half. Nontraditional&#13;
manufactured products represented 5.2 percent, nontraditional primaries 3.1&#13;
percent. In 1975, at the beginning of the liberalization, the importance of&#13;
traditional primaries decreased, mainly because of the decline in the price of&#13;
copper. The shift increased the relative importance of traditional and&#13;
nontraditional manufactures. This trend continued through 1981, when copper&#13;
exports were replaced, mostly by traditional and nontraditional manufactured&#13;
products.&#13;
At a disaggregated level, fresh fruits, the most important item&#13;
within primary nontraditionals, represented 45 percent of that category in&#13;
1971, although it was only 1.4 percent of total exports. Fresh fruits exports&#13;
were 71 percent of nontraditional exports, and their growth explains the rise&#13;
in importance of the primary nontraditional category, which accounted for 6.7&#13;
percent of total exports by 1982. Frozen seafood, the single most important&#13;
export, accounted for another 1 percent of total exports anI 8 percent of&#13;
nontraditional exports.&#13;
Prior to the reforms, in 1974 legumes (such as peas and green peas)&#13;
were the most important agricultural exports, accounting for nearly 40 percent&#13;
of the value of the sector's exports (table 4-3). Since the reforms, apples&#13;
and grapes gained in importance, reaching 64 percent of the sector's exports&#13;
in 1981. Of food products, the three most important exports were canned&#13;

peaches, legumes and other vegetables, represent 70-80 percent of the sector's&#13;
total exports every year.&#13;
Export Profitability Indices&#13;
Profits for fish products were higher than for food products,&#13;
agriculture and fishing (table 4-4). 6/ Of the primary sectors, agriculture&#13;
and fishing were the least profitable, and negatively so in 1977 and 1979.&#13;
During the remaining reform years, profit margins remained at 4 percent for&#13;
both 1978 and 1980 and 9 percent for 1981. Food products, on the contrary,&#13;
were the most profitable in 1978, with 25 percent, but then declined to 9 and&#13;
14 percent in 1980 and 1981. Finally, the fish products sector shows the most&#13;
drastic decline profit performance -- from 42 percent in 1977 down to 16&#13;
percent in 1981.&#13;
Exports in these three sectors, when comparedi to nontradables, lost&#13;
competitiveness between 1975 and 1980. Depending on t:he selection of price&#13;
index for nontradable goods, the loss ranges between 53 percent and 71 percent&#13;
for each sector (table 4-5). The trend in wages is similar: a competitive&#13;
loss of about 85 percent for every sector.  The evolution of these sectors&#13;
confirms the trend displayed in Corbo's (1983) indicators, which are at a more&#13;
aggregate level.&#13;
Export profitability thus remained low for agriculture and fishing&#13;
and even fell for the food and fish product sectors. If only prices are taken&#13;
into account, the loss in competitiveness of exports compared with nontraded&#13;
goods is also very high.&#13;

Characteristics of International Markets&#13;
Table 4-6 shows the evolution of each sector's main exports by&#13;
destination. Three periods and five markets of destinatioin were&#13;
distinguished: 1970-71, 1974-75 and 1980-81, correspond to the pre-&#13;
liberalization period, the start of the liberalization, and a period when&#13;
liberalization had been consolidated. Markets are grouped by the United&#13;
States and Canada, Central America and Mexico, South America, Europe, and&#13;
other countries (including Japan, Asia and Arab countries).&#13;
The South American market is the most important market of destination&#13;
for food products. But food product exports to the United States and Canada&#13;
increased from negligible levels before the liberalization to 10 percent of&#13;
food product exports in 1980-81. Food products, and specially canned&#13;
products, have three different markets: the domestic consuimer market, the&#13;
institutional consumer market, and the reprocessing consum,er market. Canned&#13;
peaches to be sold in a supermarket to a final consumer exemplify the first&#13;
case; canned peaches that can be recanned and sold to institutions, like the&#13;
Army, exemplify the second; tomato pulp and puree sold as a raw material for&#13;
further processing exemplify the third. Most Chilean exports of canned&#13;
products go to the reprocessing market. The United States is one of the most&#13;
important markets of that kind. Distribution channels are mainly through&#13;
brokers or foreign agents. In Europe, the most important markets are France,&#13;
the United Kingdom, and Germany, in that order. But it has been difficult for&#13;
Chilean food products exports to get into those markets because of intense&#13;
competition from Italy, Greece, Portugal and Turkey.&#13;
In fresh fruits the most important markets for Chilean products are&#13;
Europe, South America, and the United States, in that order. But the&#13;
importance of other markets, like Arab and Middle Eastern countries, is&#13;

increasing. In 1980-81 they took 15 percent of total fresh fruits exports,&#13;
the two most important of which are apples and grapes. Seasonality is also an&#13;
important aspect of fresh fruit exports. Production season in Chile is&#13;
between November and April, winter months in the northern hemisphere.&#13;
Competition comes from New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa, which is the&#13;
toughest competitor for Chile. (South Africa produces the same variety of&#13;
products and holds an important market share in North Anerican and European&#13;
markets.)&#13;
3. The Firms and the Findings&#13;
Sixteen exporting firms in the agriculture and food products sectors were&#13;
chosen with the advice of the national agency for export promotion. Some&#13;
firms had been exporting before the trade reform of 1975, while others were&#13;
new in the sense of being created after the reform. Some had once exported&#13;
but no longer did so. Some were producers for own exporting, while others&#13;
were traders for their own and others' products. And some were simply&#13;
traders.&#13;
For purposes of confidentiality, firms are identified by letter&#13;
rather than by name (see table 4-7). Eight firms dealt: in agricultural&#13;
perishables, eight in nonperishables, six in canned foods. Eight of ithe firms&#13;
concentrated mostly on production yet supplied their own international&#13;
marketing services for their products. Four firms specialized in marketing&#13;
services for their own products and those of others. Four others provided&#13;
only international marketing services. There are 22 firms altogether, since&#13;
some are classified in more than one category (for example, firm A is a fresh&#13;
and dried fruit producer as well as an exporter).&#13;

The questionnaire was designed to capture the degree of control firms&#13;
had over the international marketing variables and the changes resulting from&#13;
the liberalization process that started in 1975. Four aspects of&#13;
international marketing were considered: products, distribution, promotion&#13;
and relationships with clients. The product aspects incLude adaptation of&#13;
product and packaging for foreign markets, control over quality, and&#13;
trademarks in foreign markets. The distribution aspect includes the kinds of&#13;
agents used to distribute in foreign markets. The promotion aspect describes&#13;
the extent of the foreign promotion effort by the exporting firm.  The&#13;
relationship with clients aspect includes the initial client contact, the&#13;
methods used and the types of foreign clients.&#13;
To classify firms by their control over internat:ional marketing&#13;
variables, a point system was developed. The higher the degree of control&#13;
over the variable, the more points assigned. For example, if production was&#13;
not adapted, the firm got one point. If the firm had off-shore production,&#13;
the most developed alternative of the five possibilities, it earned five&#13;
points.&#13;
The questionnaire also probed the firm's main markets of destination&#13;
by product, its methods of export financing and its evaluation of&#13;
macroeconomic policies related to export promotion. The answers to these&#13;
questions shed light on product characteristics and the variability of&#13;
uncontrollable domestic and foreign factors, which in turn affect the firm's&#13;
desire to control more aspects of international marketing.&#13;
Since the purpose of the interviews was to obtain a general view of&#13;
the changes in marketing during the liberalization, the interviewee was&#13;
usually the general manager and sometimes the owner of the firm. On some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136 -&#13;
occasions, the marketing official also took lpart. The interviews lasted from&#13;
one to three hours, and in most cases the general managers were most willing&#13;
to cooperate.&#13;
General Characteristics by Sector&#13;
Agricultural perishables, particularly fresh fruits, are&#13;
characterized by two features: quality (color, taste, and size) and production&#13;
seasonality. These features the main factors explaining Chilean comparative&#13;
advantage in this market (see Arriagada 1984). Since Chile's growing season&#13;
is during the northern hemisphere's winter months, Argentina and Greece are&#13;
Chile's only competitors. Most firms within the sector devoted their&#13;
production to foreign markets. This is a result of two factors: production&#13;
far exceeds the domestic demand; and in many cases, such as grapes, the&#13;
domestic consumer does not like the product that goes to the foreign market.&#13;
(The exported grape has been created for the foreign market.)&#13;
North America and Europe are by far the most important markets for&#13;
these exports. Well known and traditional, t:hese two markets were significant&#13;
in Chile long before the 1975 liberalization, and are organized through&#13;
internationally known importers, which distribute exports on consignment. New&#13;
markets, like the Middle East and Asian countries, are being opened, but&#13;
remain small as compared with the first two. All fresh fruit export are&#13;
destined for direct final consumption and need no further processing. Most of&#13;
the firms (six of eight) specialized in the production or export of a few&#13;
products. For each firm, one product represents mnore than half its export&#13;
production. The two firms that are less specialized also export products&#13;
other than fresh fruits.&#13;
Agricultural nonperishables, like dry fruits and legumes, can be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -&#13;
characterized along the same lines. The quality of the product (size, color&#13;
and taste) was also mentioned as the main advantage in gaining access to&#13;
foreign markets. Most firms devote most of their production to foreign&#13;
markets, but not as much as the producers of fresh fruits. Their most&#13;
important destinations are in South America. Exports to other markets, such&#13;
as North America and Europe, are in much lower volumes. The products are for&#13;
indirect final consumption or intermediate consumption, which means that the&#13;
product either is altered in its appearance (dried fruit, which is repacked&#13;
for foreign distributors) or serves as an input for some industry in the&#13;
foreign country (dried fruits for yoghurt production). The specialization in&#13;
production and exporting is much less than for producers of agricultural&#13;
perishables. Few firms show much specialization.&#13;
The evidence suggests that to export successfully requires more&#13;
specialization in a few products and markets. The export process involves&#13;
learning how to export, achieving quality standards according to foreign&#13;
markets and being able to provide enough quantity to satisfy foreign&#13;
importers. This specialization in a few markets, however, makes the export&#13;
business more risky. Firms in agricultural nonperishables have not been able&#13;
to penetrate foreign markets as much as fresh fruits and vegetables producers&#13;
because they are still relatively unfamiliar with foreign markets and trade&#13;
channels. Added to this, their exports require a greater marketing effort.&#13;
Firms producing canned food also consider the quLality of their raw&#13;
material to be one of the main advantages in international markets. They look&#13;
at the foreign market as a complement to the domestic market, not as an end in&#13;
itself. For them, exports are a way to employ otherwise idle capacity during&#13;
some months of the year. This in turn allows them to sell while covering only&#13;
their variable costs and therefore to become relatively more competitive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 138 -&#13;
Given their special emphasis on the domestic market, producers have&#13;
diversified their production into the food sector in general, reducing the&#13;
relative importance of exports in their production volume--so as to use&#13;
installed capacity and domestic distribution charnels more efficiently.&#13;
Four of the five producers and exporters of canned foods sell less&#13;
than half their products to foreign markets, and exporting a third is quite an&#13;
achievement for them. Their main markets are South America, and when their&#13;
products go to final consumption, they concentrate exclusively in South&#13;
America. Fruit pulps and purees have broken into North America and other&#13;
markets, but almost exclusively as an input for the industrial production of&#13;
jams and juices. This is partly for two reasons: the lower cost of the&#13;
container, and lower costs of international marketing of pulps and purees.&#13;
While the tin for canned fruits for final consumption accounts for about 60&#13;
percent of the production cost, this cost decreases to about 30 percent for&#13;
pulps.&#13;
The canned foods sector requires of exporters the greatest interna-&#13;
tional marketing effort of those in the sample. There also is not much&#13;
uniform behavior by firms in this sector. Two firms do not even care about&#13;
export markets, while the others have made serious efforts to get into foreign&#13;
markets.&#13;
Development of Exporting Firms&#13;
The export response of a firm depends on economic and behavioral&#13;
aspects. I define the behavioral aspect as an attitude of the firms to get&#13;
involved into exports and measure it by the controL the firm has over&#13;
international marketing factors. In other words, the study follows the&#13;
international marketing approach to foreign trade.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 139 -&#13;
A firm may be classified as a passive exporter or an active exporter&#13;
(in five grades) depending on its control over international marketing. This&#13;
classification corresponds closely to the one proposed by 'Wortzel and Wortzel&#13;
(1979) for manufactured products, but with some modifications to make it&#13;
appropriate for our sample: primary products and other prodlucts with a low&#13;
degree of processing. The passive exporter has not made a specific decision&#13;
to seek export business. The foreign importer makes most of the marketing&#13;
effort and, in most cases, the exporter merely provides the production&#13;
capacity and facilities. The grade 1 and grade 2 active exporters have made a&#13;
commitment toward exports. They are still sellers of underused production&#13;
capacity rather than products, and they are price competitive. The grade 2&#13;
active exporter takes some responsibility for quality control, may have its&#13;
own agent for foreign distribution, does some promotion in groups with other&#13;
firms and travels periodically to contact its clients. The grade 3 active&#13;
exporter is in most cases still an exporter of excess production capacity, but&#13;
goes to greater lengths to let the importer know its capabilities. It&#13;
distributes abroad through its own agent, allocates more resources to&#13;
promotion, and keeps offices abroad to maintain the relationship with&#13;
clients. Among these exporters are ones that sell products (rather than&#13;
excess capacity) and make significant efforts toward distribution and&#13;
promotion abroad. To sell products means to develop products specially for&#13;
the export market.  The grade 4 and grade 5 active exporters are exporters of&#13;
products and have many marketing capabilities. They are shown as theoretical&#13;
possibilities, since none of the producers in our sample fell into those&#13;
categories. The highest grade attained by the firms in the sample is grade 3,&#13;
given the product characteristics described before.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 140 -&#13;
Most firms in the sample are active exporters between grades 1 and&#13;
2. They have developed some expertise as exporters and cannot be considered&#13;
as passive exporters. To some extent they adapt their products for export&#13;
markets, sometimes have their own exports for foreign distribution, and&#13;
constantly travel to visit clients, mostly foreign wholesale distributors.&#13;
The degree of development achieved by firms in the agricultural perishables&#13;
and agricultural nonperishables sectors is quite similar. Firm Q is more&#13;
advanced than the others, but it is a general export merchant that does more&#13;
than agricultural production. In canned foods, the behavior of firms varies&#13;
widely ranging from one that is not an exporter to another that is at the&#13;
highest stage of development of the firms in the sample.&#13;
What can be said about how far thet firms are from their "optimum"&#13;
degree of development as exporters? The optimum degree depends on the&#13;
characteristics of the product. Of the three sectors considered, canned foods&#13;
requires the highest marketing effort, followed by agricultural nonperishables&#13;
and then by agricultural perishables. Firms producing agricultural&#13;
perishables are thus likely to be closer to their optimum than firms in the&#13;
agricultural nonperishable sector. The diversity of behavior in the canned&#13;
foods sector makes any general conclusion difficult, but it seems likely that&#13;
many of them are farthest from their optimum degree of development.&#13;
Some Specific Marketing Issues and Stories&#13;
The control a firm has over international marketing is an indication&#13;
of the firm's behavior, which in turn determines its export responses. The&#13;
first marketing issue relates to the need for product adaptation to satisfy&#13;
export markets. Are firms exporting the same product that they are selling&#13;
the domestic markets? Or are they adapting the product to respond to foreign&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 141 -&#13;
demand?  In fresh fruits, product adaptation was necessary in the sense that&#13;
firms had to develop special varieties of fruits before they could export. It&#13;
is not possible to enter the North American or European market with the same&#13;
variety of fruit sold in the domestic market. Some firms even invest in&#13;
product research to fulfill the quality standards of foreign maLrkets, a clear&#13;
indication of export orientation. This investment also had a positive impact&#13;
on the domestic market, because the quality of fruit for the domestic market&#13;
improved along with the opening of foreign markets.&#13;
For most of the exporters of fresh fruits, quality and product&#13;
presentation (color and size) are the most important issues of adaptation.&#13;
Export improvements after liberalization are mostly due to qua]Lity&#13;
improvements which are due to better production techniques.  In the other&#13;
sectors, product adaptation was not very important. In canned food, it&#13;
consisted of adding different amounts of sugar to the fruit purees and pulps&#13;
to fulfill the requirements of the importer.&#13;
The importance given to quality control also indicates export&#13;
behavior. The more the instances of quality control required by the foreign&#13;
importer, the less the confidence in the Chilean producer and exporter.&#13;
Confidence is crucial in international trade. The telex is, for example, the&#13;
usual way to arrange contracts. Sometimes a telephone call is enough. When&#13;
the importer has had a bad experience with one producer -- in the sense that&#13;
the quality does not correspond to the agreement -- that importer will later&#13;
require a quality certificate issued by a specialized international firm if it&#13;
is to keep doing business with the producer.&#13;
In fresh fruits, given that most exports to North America and Europe&#13;
went on consignment, the exporter bore all the responsibility for quality. If&#13;
the importer received the fruit in bad shape, the exporter did1 not receive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -&#13;
payment. This business is made even riskier because the trader can withhold&#13;
price information from the producer. The risk is less for nonperishables and&#13;
canned foods, which are sold not on consignment- but against spot payment.&#13;
Here the confidence is a crucial issue. Some firms -- like firm C, an old&#13;
exporter of dried fruits -- have developed solid relationships with their&#13;
agent overseas. A relationship of many years makes quality control regulation&#13;
unnecessary.  But firms that are new in the market -- such as H and K -- have&#13;
to go through quality control tests by specialized firms.&#13;
Trademarks may also reflect the degree of development of an export&#13;
business. Fresh fruits get to foreign markets without the need for a&#13;
trademark. They are sold as "Chilean fruit," or sometimes even without&#13;
identification, just as grapes or apples with the importer's trademark. The&#13;
exporter loses all identification with the product. But in nonperishable&#13;
products and foods for final consumption, tradernarks become more relevant. In&#13;
canned foods, some firms have introduced a trademark in a foreign market, but&#13;
only in South America -- in markets next to Chile, like Peru. In most cases,&#13;
exports of pulps and purees for industrial use clo not need trademarks as much&#13;
as products for final consumption do. The less the need for a trademark, the&#13;
more successful these firms were in entering the) export market, and the less&#13;
the investment needed to penetrate foreign markets.&#13;
Timely delivery is another marketing issue that has some bearing on&#13;
export behavior. In general, all firms in the sample considered it important,&#13;
but for different reasons. Fresh fruit producers and exporters believe that&#13;
on-time arrivals in foreign markets are a major determinant of price. The&#13;
earlier on in the season the shipment, the better their chances of selling at&#13;
advantageous prices. In nonperishables and canned foods, where sales are made&#13;
on the spot, on-time delivery reflected the seriousness and responsibility of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 143 -&#13;
the exporter, a very important factor in keeping the foreign client. Most&#13;
firms in the sample shared this awareness and were very conscious of time.&#13;
4. Conclusions and Policy Recommendations&#13;
The firms in the agriculture and food products sector believe that exporting&#13;
is riskier than producing for the domestic market. Foreign markets are less&#13;
known, require higher quality, and involve international marketing issues.&#13;
And profitability depends mainly on the evolution of the real exchange rate.&#13;
Firms control only a few variables, and the outcome of their decisions depends&#13;
on many events beyond their control. In this sense the stability of&#13;
macroeconomic policy, and of the exchange rate policy in particular, is the&#13;
most important exogenous factor determining whether the firm will become&#13;
involved in exports. To make exports a fundamental element in the business&#13;
strategy takes not a day or two but a much longer period of time. This period&#13;
becomes longer and requires a larger investment the more manufacturing&#13;
intensive the product is and the more unknown the foreign markets are.&#13;
Most firms in the sample developed a commitment toward exports&#13;
throughout the liberalization. (Only one firm, firm L, was a passive&#13;
exporter.) The rapid increase of the real exchange rate at the beginning of&#13;
1975 was the first clear signal for almost all the firms to get into exports,&#13;
specially those that had a clear export potential as fresh fruit producers.&#13;
But it must be remembered that foreign policy never gave signls toward export&#13;
promotion, or favoring exports against import substitution. The policy was&#13;
one with a small bias toward import substitution.&#13;
Some firms had been exporting before, and others started exporting&#13;
after 1975 or were created specifically for exports after the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 144 -&#13;
liberalization. For fresh fruit producers and exporters, the most active&#13;
exporters in the sample, the product and market charascteristics were similar,&#13;
as was their behavior. The foreign markets and distribution channels were&#13;
known before the liberalization of 1975, and there was long experience of&#13;
exporting. But with the liberalization there followed the introduction of&#13;
specialized traders who provided export services to many fresh fruit&#13;
producers. There followed, too, a pattern of specialization on a few products&#13;
by producers. The reaction of fresh fruit exporters corresponds to Keesing's&#13;
(1979) "easy stage of export development," the reaction of natural-resource-&#13;
based exports with low marketing requirements.&#13;
Most producers of dried fruits and vegetables, when compared with&#13;
fresh fruit producers, rank at a lower level of development as exporters,&#13;
(around grade 1 active exporters). Foreign marke!ts for dried fruits and&#13;
vegetables were less known before the liberalization, and the products demand&#13;
more international marketing. For example, firm Q, a trader of many different&#13;
products, also achieved a lower level of development as an exporter of dried&#13;
fruits than of fresh fruits. Firms are more reluctant to invest in the export&#13;
business -- opening distribution channels, developing trademarks or improving&#13;
contacts with foreign clients -- because they were not sure about the&#13;
stability of macroeconomic policy.&#13;
For canned food producers and exporters it is hard to get to a&#13;
general conclusion given the lack of a common patl:ern in the behavior of the&#13;
different firms in the sample. Firm L was clearly a passive exporter or a&#13;
nonexporter. Firm N ranked highest as an exporter. Firm M started business&#13;
in 1976, focusing only on the foreign market, and by 1981 was mostly devoted&#13;
to the domestic market. These three cases can tell much about firm strategies&#13;
for exports. Firm L was once an exporter of canned fruiits and an important&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 145 -&#13;
exporter to Peru. It believed in the liberalization attempt at the beginning&#13;
of 1960s. The reversal of that policy created financial losses for them.&#13;
Given that experience, they will not export unless a foreign buyer shows up.&#13;
So, they treat foreign buyers as another local consumer. Nor did they place&#13;
trust in the liberalization of 1975: they did not change their orientation&#13;
from the domestic market. Firm M, the other extreme, was created in 1976 with&#13;
the sole purpose of producing tomato pulp for foreign markets. It belongs to&#13;
an international conglomerate with experience in foreign markets. It put&#13;
trust in the liberalization of 1975. It took them about one year to start&#13;
production.  By the time they started exporting, export profitability was&#13;
starting to fall. They remained steadfast for two years, and then decided to&#13;
diversify production and focus on the domestic market. Firm N, created long&#13;
before the liberalization, has been trying to export canned fEruits since its&#13;
creation. It developed an export mentality, even though in some years the&#13;
firm exported only 30 percent of its production. It understood that exporting&#13;
is a long-term business, and it wanted to be prepared for thLe time when the&#13;
country decides to adopt a serious export promotion policy. Firm N defined&#13;
the liberalization of 1975 as a serious effort that did not Last long enough.&#13;
In relation to the export evolution through trade liberalization&#13;
described by Keesing and others at the World Bank, the firms of the sample are&#13;
in the transition between the old import-substitution strategy and an export-&#13;
led strategy. The firms are waiting for evidence of a permanent commitment by&#13;
the government to the liberalization strategy. This attitude is especially&#13;
true for the producers of vegetables, dried fruits and canned food.&#13;
About the role of the state in supporting international marketing,&#13;
none of the firms supported the creation of state-owned export groups. All&#13;
thought learning-by-doing was strictly necessary. But policymakers can reduce&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -&#13;
many institutional constraints, domestic and foreign, that may be crucial for&#13;
export expansion. In this respect, many countries impose many nontariff&#13;
restrictions to trade to protect their domestic firms. A government&#13;
initiative to reduce foreign restrictions to domoestic exports may greatly&#13;
benefit domestic firms. The whole issue of bilat:eral trade agreements&#13;
confirms this contention. Ignoring these institutional imperfections of&#13;
international trade reduces the effectiveness of any export promotion&#13;
policy. Increasing the information about foreign market characteristics,&#13;
marketing channels and other related issues is of great importance for the&#13;
potential exporter, who may not be able to export: without that assistance.&#13;
And there are many examples of joint efforts between the government and the&#13;
private sector -- such as having firms publish brochures with information&#13;
about their products and having the government support foreign distribution&#13;
through embassies and other public offices abroad.&#13;
Last, firms must perceive, whether they are actual or potential&#13;
exporters, a strong commitment toward exports on the part of the economic&#13;
authorities. Hearing ministers talk about the importance of exports when they&#13;
reduce the real exchange rate to artificially low levels confuses&#13;
entrepreneurs and makes them reluctant to embark on exports. The opinion of&#13;
one businessman in Chile illustrates this: "I won't ever go into exports,&#13;
because as soon as the copper price goes up the wLhole effort to promote&#13;
exports will halt."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Notes&#13;
1.  The main objectives of this strategy, in accord with ofEicial documents,&#13;
were: "to obtain a high and continued economic growth, and social&#13;
development concurring with this economic development, in order to&#13;
eliminate extreme inequalities. To attain this objective, the economical&#13;
system should be based on a free trade policy, defining a subsidiary role&#13;
for the Government in all those activities that cannot be effectively&#13;
developed by private enterprise. These principles are defined in various&#13;
official documents, such as "Declaracion de Principios del Gobierno de&#13;
Chile."&#13;
2. Adelman and Robinson (1978) study the income distribution effect&#13;
experienced by some countries that shift from an import: substitution&#13;
strategy to an export promotion strategy. They conclude that the effect&#13;
is positive.&#13;

APPENDIX&#13;
Brief Description of the Firms in the Study&#13;
Firm A is a family business that can be classified as a small firm,&#13;
with sales of less than $2 million a year. It was founded in 1958 and employs&#13;
around 200 people in the low season and up to 300 people in the peak season.&#13;
Managed by its owner, it produces fresh fruits and vegetables, the first for&#13;
the domestic and foreign markets and the latter only for the domestic&#13;
market. It exports its own products, and does not trust traders.&#13;
Firm B is also a family business that started in 1977, mainly as a&#13;
result of liberalization. It sells less than $2 million dollars a year and&#13;
employs around 200 people. Half its business invoLves exporting its own&#13;
products, and half exporting that of others. It exports both fresh and dried&#13;
fruits, in about equal shares.&#13;
Firm C is an old family business that started in 1929. Considered&#13;
the oldest exporting firm of fresh fruit in the country, it also exports its&#13;
own production and that of others. It used to be in fresh fruits and legumes,&#13;
but since 1975 it has specialized in legumes. Its operations have slackened&#13;
considerably, with sales now about $500,000 a year., This firm is very&#13;
interesting since it is considered the pioneer in fresh fruits exports to the&#13;
United States, where its owner lived for many years in the 1920s and learned&#13;
the business in New York. Given the age of the owner, the firm was retiring&#13;
from the market when the liberalization began.&#13;
Firm D is a limited liability company that started in 1976, also as a&#13;
result of liberalization. About 40 percent of its business is exporting its&#13;
own production, and 60 percent exporting the production of others. Only in&#13;
the fresh fruit business, it sells between $20 million and $40 million a year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 149 -&#13;
Firm E is an association of producers that started out at the end of&#13;
1981. Its main business is to provide export services to its associates.&#13;
Devoted to fresh fruits and heavily concentrated in grapes, it does not sell&#13;
to the domestic market. It was created by a group of producers that decided&#13;
to establish an exporting firm to trade their own products abroad. It sells&#13;
around $8 million a year and employs around 400 people in the peak season.&#13;
Firm F is a limited liability company started in 1974. It sells&#13;
abour $12 million a year, with its own production repriesenting only 15 percent&#13;
of sales. Only into fresh fruits, it does not sell to the domestic market.&#13;
Firm H, a limited liability company that started business in 1981, is&#13;
a trading company formed by people who worked at other trading companies. It&#13;
exports fresh fruits and dried fruits, about 250,000 dollars worth a year.&#13;
Firm I is a family business devoted to the production and export of&#13;
legumes. Started in 1950, it is one of the main firms in that market. Before&#13;
liberalization it was only selling to the domestic market. It started&#13;
exporting in 1974, employs around 200 people and sells between $15 and $20&#13;
million a year, 65 to 70 percent in the domestic market.&#13;
Firm J, an association of producers of dried fruits, started in 1941&#13;
but has been active since 1975. It sells around $2 million a year, 90 percent&#13;
to foreign markets.&#13;
Firm K is a limited liability company that started business in&#13;
1979. A trader of nonperishables legumes, dried fruits, and canned fruit, it&#13;
also trades other products like fish meal and imports some products for the&#13;
domestic market.&#13;
Firm L is a family business into the canned fruits, legumes and food&#13;
products business. It started in 1973 and sells between $20 million and $40&#13;
million a year, almost all to the domestic market. It is an interesting case&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 150 -&#13;
because this firm did export to the Latin American market before the&#13;
liberalization of 1975. Given the instability of the country's foreign&#13;
policy, it decided in the 1960s to retire from exports and it does not want to&#13;
get into exports any more.&#13;
Firm M, part of an international conglomerate, started in 1975 with&#13;
tomato pulp production only for the foreign market, as a direct result of&#13;
liberalization. In 1977 it started selling to the domestic market because&#13;
foreign business was becoming unstable. As a result of entering the domestic&#13;
market, it diversified its production and by 1982 was selling 70 percent to&#13;
the domestic market and 30 percent to the foreign market. Its original&#13;
strategy was to specialize in one or two products devoted exclusively to&#13;
foreign markets. Its experience shows that without a stable foreign policy,&#13;
such a strategy is highly risky, and it had to get into the domestic market.&#13;
Firm N, an old family business in canned fruits and canned legumes,&#13;
started business in the beginning of the century. It is the opposite of firm&#13;
L. Firm N, also an exporter, had been mostly to Latin American countries.&#13;
Its share of exports in production ranged between 30 percent and 70 percent,&#13;
depending on the year. Independent of the share of exports, their objective&#13;
is to sell to the foreign market.&#13;
Firm 0 belongs to a national conglomerate in canned foods and other&#13;
food products.  Its main market is the domestic- market.  It had been into&#13;
exports, specially in Peru, but like firm L, it considers exports as too risky&#13;
given unstable foreign trade conditions.&#13;
Firm P also belongs to a national conglomerate that entered the food&#13;
products business before the liberalization of 1975. In 1979 it specialized&#13;
in canned fruits and started to export. Now exporting between 20 and 25&#13;
percent of its production its sales are between. $20 and $40 million a year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 151 -&#13;
Firm Q is a trading company that belongs to an international&#13;
conglomerate. It started in 1981 with the objective of providing export&#13;
services in agriculture, fishing, forestry, and other sectors of the economy.&#13;
A qualitative questionnaire similar to the annex in this volume was&#13;
used as a guide for an interview with the manager. In the marketing research&#13;
literature this method is known as a "nonstructured direct interview" or&#13;
"interview in depth" 8/.  This is the most adequate method when the objective&#13;
of the study is to detect motivational factors. Its main disadvantage,&#13;
however, is the lack of a systematic structure for interpreting and for making&#13;
statistical inferences based on the information collected.&#13;

This paper analyzes how Uruguayan firms reacted to the fundamental changes in&#13;
the economic environment during 1974-82. Essentially, those changes relate to&#13;
what has been called "the real side" of the economy -- to the set of&#13;
incentives and disincentives for domestic production and trade in goods and&#13;
services. But because a vigorous financial liberalization took place at the&#13;
same time, the paper also deals with how financial reforms affected the&#13;
performance of goods-producing firms. Keeping that in minid, the principal&#13;
reforms to be covered here are the liberalization of domestic prices, the&#13;
reduction of barriers to imports, the adoption of an export-led growth&#13;
strategy, and the explicit use of the exchange rate as an instrument for&#13;
controlling inflation.&#13;
1. The Rules of the Game Before the Reforms&#13;
By mid-1968 political reasons precluded appropriate currency devaluations&#13;
while inflation proceeded at an average rate of 8 percent a month, or 150&#13;
percent a year. The competitiveness of Uruguay's tradable goods sectors thus&#13;
began to be severely eroded, and this led the administration to freeze all&#13;
prices and wages in June 1968. 1/ The freeze slowed inflation during the&#13;
second half of 1968 to about 1 percent.&#13;
The main instrument of such deep economic intervention was the&#13;
Consejo de Productividad, Precios e Ingresos (COPRIN). The main function of&#13;
Jaime Mezzera is with the ILO. This paper is an extension of Mezzera&#13;
(1984). This research represents a collaborative effort between the two&#13;
institutions and was jointly funded. World Bank support was provided under&#13;
RPO 672-85, "Liberalization with Stabilization in the Southern Cone." We&#13;
thank Vittorio Corbo and Gabriel Castillo for helpful inputs and suggestions&#13;
on an earlier draft.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

COPRIN was to control every price rise in the economy.  Its intervention&#13;
ranged from such key prices as wages and interest rates to the prices of&#13;
short-sleeved white school shirts, canned tuna fish, and ballpoint pens.&#13;
COPRIN had the authority to inspect the records of producer firms to ascertain&#13;
the truthfulness of the detailed declarations of cost increases that firms had&#13;
to present. COPRIN would also authorize or reject the requests for price&#13;
increases for individual goods. Over time, the Largest firms developed&#13;
bargaining methods for price increases with COPRIN. This bargaining must have&#13;
played some role in the resumption of inflation in 1969: inflation averaged&#13;
close to 60 percent a year during 1969-74.&#13;
Even though inflation resumed, COPRIN continued to intervene. Much&#13;
of the effort of firms was directed at complying -- and at finding safe ways&#13;
not to comply -- with COPRIN's rules. A famous example was that of toilet&#13;
paper. Regulated in price and length, it got thinner, and when width was&#13;
regulated, it became coarser. Reductions in quality were similar for many&#13;
other products, reductions that continued until competition with foreign goods&#13;
increased.&#13;
The other area of inten,se intervention was foreign trade. The&#13;
tradition began in 1875, when tariffs of between 10 and 90 percent were&#13;
applied to imports of products to be domestically produced. (Several&#13;
essential agricultural inputs were explicitly granted import exemptions.) The&#13;
Customs Law of 1875 tried to promote industrialization and consolidate the&#13;
budding modernization in the rural areas.  The history of protection in&#13;
Uruguay is therefore long and rich but will, not be described here. 2/&#13;
From the end of the Second World War until the mid-1950s, protection&#13;
remained high but manageable. In the mid-1950s, however, the reduced capacity&#13;
to import caused by the sharp reduction of the price of Uruguayan exports&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 157 -&#13;
signaled the deepening and increasing sophistication of the array of protec--&#13;
tive measures. By 1972-73 this array was extremely complicated (up to a dozen&#13;
different trade taxes were levied on some imports). Nominal protection was&#13;
high, and effective protection was inscrutable. The complications of the&#13;
system led firms to believe (rightly) that obtaining tariff advantages was&#13;
probably at least as important as bolstering productivity or improving quality&#13;
control.&#13;
A third area of intense intervention was the exchange rate. Multiple&#13;
exchange rates existed until 1959 when a dual exchange rate system (fixed&#13;
commercial and floating financial) was established. 3/ After a long period of&#13;
trying to contain it, the commercial rate was devalued threefold in 1959, and&#13;
it was assumed that the new rate would persist for a long timle. 4/  It did not&#13;
persist, however and during 1963-68 the exchange rate rose from 11 pesos to&#13;
the dollar to 250. Between 1968 and March 1972, this rate was politically&#13;
determined and constant, and once again the gap between the financial and&#13;
commercial rates widened.  During the period, the rise in domestic prices was&#13;
countered with increasingly high and varied tariffs and by a 50 percent tax on&#13;
all foreign exchange transactions (another hidden devaluation) adopted in&#13;
1971. By early 1972, however, the rate was devalued to 500, and a crawling&#13;
peg was instituted with the aim of maintaining a fairly constant real exchange&#13;
rate. 5/ At the same time, the economic cost of the real revaluation of the&#13;
peso after 1968 had to be paid in the form of a 3 percent fall in GNP in 1972&#13;
and stagnation in 1973.&#13;
In sum, before the reforms Uruguay must have been one of the most&#13;
intensely interventionist of the mixed economies. Its three main economic&#13;
characteristics were the very high rate of inflation, the stagnation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 158 -&#13;
exports (at about $200 million a year for 20 years), and a consequently&#13;
sluggish rate of CDP growth of 0.3 percent in 1961-67 and 1.9 percent in 1968.&#13;
2. The Record During the Reforms&#13;
The first period (1974-78) was dominated by the Minister of Economy, Alejandro&#13;
Vegh Villegas, and by four main actions: (1) the change to export-led growth;&#13;
(2) a coherent attempt to reduce inflation (seen as a goal complementary but&#13;
subsidiary to increasing growth); (3) a big reduction in the government's&#13;
intervention in economic affairs, symbolized by the dismantling of COPRIN; and&#13;
(4) liberalization of the financial sector, including the removal of all&#13;
controls on capital flows (for the first time Uruguayans could hold dollar-&#13;
denominated accounts in Uruguayan banks) and the progressive elimination of&#13;
interest rate controls, until they were freed by late 1977.&#13;
The results were an increase in the average CDP growth rate to 4.6&#13;
percent a year. This improvement was led by an increase in the investment&#13;
rate and by the growth of nontraditional exports at almost 25 percent a&#13;
year. Growth performance during 1974-78 was certainly above historical trends&#13;
(see table 5-1). Aided by lagging wage growth and a reduced fiscal deficit,&#13;
inflation also fell. Fiscal deficits were greatly curtailed and finally&#13;
turned into surpluses, largely by reducing the state's wage bill. This&#13;
reduced domestic demand and real wages along with employment. Contractionary&#13;
policies were the centerpiece of anti-inflationary policy until 1978-79.&#13;
The second period (1979-1981) was formally initiated in mid-1977 when&#13;
Vegh Villegas gave his job to his former Undersecretary, Valentin Arismendi,&#13;
but it really began in early 1979. This period is basically represented by a&#13;

shift in the main economic objective from growth to the reduction of&#13;
inflation. The authorities moved in two directions., First, they continued&#13;
reducing government intervention in the economy. This involved further&#13;
removal of price controls and deregulation of commercial banks. It also&#13;
involved deep or complete cuts in the subsidies and credit incentives to&#13;
exports, which compounded the effect of a falling real exchange rate on the&#13;
profitability of exporting. But as indicated in table 5-1, exports continued&#13;
to grow, due to the temporary exports to Argentina. These exports&#13;
materialized because Argentina was also following an anti-inflationary&#13;
strategy similar to Uruguay's but with even more vigor, so that the Argentine&#13;
peso appreciated vis-a-vis the Uruguayan peso during 1979-80.&#13;
Second, authorities changed their approach to stabilization policy by&#13;
relying on the precepts of the monetary approach to the balance of payments&#13;
and by the use of the exchange rate as their basic anti-inflationary tool.&#13;
This involved preannouncing the exchange rate (to reduce inflationary&#13;
expectations) and reducing the rate of crawl well below the difference between&#13;
domestic and world inflation, while relying on a passive monetary policy, in&#13;
which the money supply reacted only to changes in international reserves. The&#13;
authorities firmly believed that both the laws of one price and of one&#13;
interest rate would hold in the short run for both tradable goods and domestic&#13;
interest rates. Neither held: the real exchange rate fell sharply (table 5-&#13;
1) and the peso-dollar interest rate spreads remained high (table 5-2). The&#13;
real exchange rate stability after the adoption of the crawling peg in March&#13;
1972 was destroyed and the overall profitability of exporting fell (Hanson and&#13;
de Melo, 1985, table 5-4).&#13;
During this second period, growth had tiwo engines: residential&#13;
construction and exports to Argentina. Private investment in construction&#13;

grew 45.5 percent in 1979 and a further 22.2 percent in 1980. And exports to&#13;
Argentina increased more than 20 percent in 1979 and a further 44 percent in&#13;
1980; this meant that, of export increases in 1979, 60 percent went to&#13;
Argentina. 6/ These two indicators strongly suggest that the real revaluation&#13;
of the Uruguayan peso during 1979-81 damaged the profitability of domestically&#13;
producing tradable goods and that the negative consequences of this were&#13;
overcompensated by the spillover of Argentine demand into nontradables in&#13;
Uruguay and into Uruguayan tradables exported to the Argentine markets. 7/&#13;
The wedging of the small Uruguayan economy between Argentina and&#13;
Brazil amplified shocks for domestic producers during this second period.&#13;
This position had led to economic difficulties in the past, but rarely as&#13;
acute as in 1980, when Argentina was undergoing a strong real revaluation and&#13;
Brazil a strong real devaluation (Mezzera 1980). Uruguayan industry had&#13;
absolute advantage in almost nothing vis-a-vis Brazil and almost everything&#13;
vis-a-vis Argentina. So, Uruguay imported wheat and clothing from Brazil but&#13;
sold beef, automobiles, and TV sets to Argentina. 8/ Imports from Brazil were&#13;
17 percent of all imports in 1978, but rose to 28 percent in 1981. Exports to&#13;
Argentina -- 6 percent of all exports in 1978 -- rose to 12 percent in 1981&#13;
(CINVE 1983). The purchasing-power-parity recommendation -- devaluing in&#13;
accord with the behavior of domestic inflation vis-a-vis inflation and&#13;
devaluation in the main trading partners -- thus could not be carried out. 9/&#13;
The rapidly appreciating Argentine peso led to heavy reliance on&#13;
exports to Argentina. Firms that could not go this route, for whatever&#13;
reason, began to do badly in 1980. Those that specialized in selling in&#13;
Buenos Aires did very well until mid-1981, but then they found themselves in a&#13;
difficult situation when Argentina re-established its competitiveness by a&#13;
strong real devaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 163 -&#13;
The third period thus begins in mid-1981, when the full brunt of&#13;
Uruguay's exchange rate overvaluation fell on producers of tradable goods,&#13;
largely as a consequence of the Argentine devaluations beginning in March of&#13;
1981. A significant fall in GDP (9.7 percent in 1982) followed the Argentine&#13;
devaluation. Open unemployment rose and foreign exchange reserves fell&#13;
because of capital flight reflecting doubts about the sustainability of the&#13;
anti-inflationary exchange rate policy. The flotation of the peso in late&#13;
November 1982 marked the end of the experiment with this new approach to&#13;
stabilization policy.&#13;
3. Implementing the Reforms&#13;
Frequent policy changes led to a tortuous implementation of reforms. Below,&#13;
we review the phasing out of domestic price controls, and the reduction in&#13;
foreign trade restrictions; we also give some estimates of the resulting set&#13;
of incentives for producers.&#13;
Phasing Out Price Controls&#13;
As stated earlier, the intervention in prices extended to almost all&#13;
goods and to many services. In June 1974 price controls remained in effect&#13;
for some 96 percent of all goods included in the basket usetd to compute the&#13;
cost of living index. This percentage then fell fairly steadily but not&#13;
rapidly: in 1977 it was still 51 percent. But by 1980 only a few goods&#13;
remained under price control. Strangely, the list was short, but it included&#13;
items as disparate as bread, automobiles, and school supplies. The effect of&#13;
all this was that COPRIN effectively determined who and what was profitable,&#13;
who and what was not. The effect of that, in turn, was that firms' top&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 164 -&#13;
priority was to influence COPRIN's decisions rather than carrying out&#13;
productive activities.&#13;
Reducing Import Restrictions and Providing Export Subsidies&#13;
The main effect of the changes in trade policies was to generate a&#13;
far more open economy than was thought possible in Uruguay in the late 1960s.&#13;
During 1974-78 this was accomplished by some tariff cuts and removal of most&#13;
quantitative restrictions (QRs), but mainly by export promotion.&#13;
Controls on imports were relaxed in three ways. The first lifted the&#13;
prohibition to import capital goods. This prohibition had been imposed in&#13;
1972 in response to a severe external crisis (in turn due to the fixed&#13;
exchange rate policy of 1968-71). By 1974 some imports of small capital goods&#13;
(up to $5,000) were admitted if they were externally financed for at least six&#13;
months. By early 1975 this limit was raised to $20,000 and eliminated&#13;
altogether for industries declared to be "of national interest" -- mainly&#13;
export-oriented industries. By 1977 imports of capital goods were no longer&#13;
subject to QRs.&#13;
The second liberated imports by chopping off the highest tariffs and&#13;
by removing quantitative restrictions, a residue of the several external&#13;
crises of the 1960s and early 1970s. This tariff-cutting began in 1974 and&#13;
was followed up in 1977. But even in 1978 goods that had enjoyed tariffs of&#13;
300 percent saw them reduced to "only" 150 percent.  But little was achieved&#13;
in removing the use of aforos -- reference prices tagged on to goods for&#13;
purposes of tariff calculation. (By increasing the aforo, the internal price&#13;
of many imports could be substantially raised even when the official tariff&#13;
remained constant. Cases have been identified of an aforo 10 times higher&#13;
than the c.i.f. price.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 165 -&#13;
The third introduced a formal program of tariff reductions in early&#13;
1980. The program, to last six years, proposed yearly reductions of a sixth&#13;
of the difference between the tariff on each good as of January 1980 and 35&#13;
percent, which would become the flat tariff by December 1985. Unlike most&#13;
other reforms, this one was supposed to give ample advance notice to allow&#13;
firms to plan ahead for the new set of incentives.&#13;
In turn, export promotion was accomplished through direct subsidies&#13;
(reintegros) and credit incentives. The reintegros were originally defined as&#13;
a compensation for the effects of tariffs and other distortions on the produc-&#13;
tion costs of potentially exportable manufactured goods., After 1973-74 they&#13;
were quite openly used as plain subsidies. 10/ To some extent this involved&#13;
betting on a slow reaction by importing countries. That bet was successful&#13;
for a fairly long period, since the first negative reaction came only in 1978&#13;
when some products benefiting from reintegros suffered with the imposition of&#13;
countervailing duties in the U.S. market -- and then only because such duties&#13;
were being applied to similar Brazilian exports. ReintEgros were determined&#13;
case-by-case by the Laboratorio Tecnologico del Uruguay (LATU), a body of&#13;
technicians who analyzed each cost-price situation and decreed a reintegro.&#13;
In a clear parallel to the way COPRIN used to work, LATLI could -- and often&#13;
did -- decide that, say, short-sleeved white school shirts would receive a 32&#13;
percent reintegro while long-sleeved blue school shirts only deserved 17.5&#13;
percent.&#13;
The direct subsidies were always viewed as a transitory measure --&#13;
with none of the permanence implicitly attached to tariffs. The act that&#13;
created reintegros gave the date of their elimination. By June 1975 the&#13;
authorities began to introduce some order in what had become a very chaotic&#13;
system. In general, the usual duration of the subsidy was reduced from three&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 166 -&#13;
to two years. Those reintegros set to vanish in mid-1975 were extended for a&#13;
further year and cut by 10 percent. In May 1976 reintegros due in mid-1976&#13;
were extended for a year and again in 1977, when they were reduced by a flat&#13;
20 percent. In 1980 all reintegros were extended until 1982; from then on,&#13;
they were to fall in a programmed way down to 5 percent by 1985, at which time&#13;
tariffs would have converged to 35 percent.&#13;
Thus, excluding the temporary financial subsidies discussed below,&#13;
the trade reforms were never intended to entirely remove the bias against&#13;
exporting activities: by 1985, the bias against exporting would still be 28&#13;
percent.&#13;
Another component of the export promotion policy was a variety of&#13;
credit instruments that carried strongly negative real interest rates. There&#13;
were basically four of them, all restricted to nontraditional exports:&#13;
Financiamento de la pre-exportacion, designed to cover market-pene-&#13;
tration expenses, of which 60 percent were financed for up to 18&#13;
months at a nominal interest rate of 18 percent in domestic currency&#13;
(while average inflation was about 50 percent).&#13;
o    Pre-anticipo de divisas, arrangements by which the exporter turned&#13;
over foreign exchange to the central bank in advance and received&#13;
pesos in exchange with an interest rat:e of between 3 and 20 percent.&#13;
o    Pre-financiacion de exportaciones, the main form by which would-be&#13;
exporters received credit for their working capital needs by having&#13;
their documents rediscounted at the central bank.&#13;
o    Anticipo de divisas, the instrument by which the central bank took&#13;
the credit documents received by the exporter and lent up to 80&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 167 -&#13;
percent of their value for up to 180 days at an interest rate of 18&#13;
percent.&#13;
The first instrument covered the preproduction period, the second and third&#13;
allowed production to proceed on credit, and the fourth allowed domestic&#13;
exporters to sell on credit to foreign customers while collecting their dues&#13;
at once.  All these instruments involved negative real interest rates of&#13;
between 20 and 30 percent.&#13;
When the export promotion regime first expanded in 1973-75, it&#13;
provoked sharp criticism not only because of LATU's discretionality but mainly&#13;
because of the size of the reintegros and their ample coverage. Much of this&#13;
criticism came from traditional exporters, who rightly interpreted these&#13;
measures as substituting for an even higher exchange rate -- which would have&#13;
benefited them, too. From several other quarters -- including academicians,&#13;
former politicians, and the press -- came complaints that: the export-promotion&#13;
policy was merely repeating, with the opposite sign, the worst protective&#13;
excesses of import subsititution.&#13;
In the face of the then-prevalent situation of the Uruguayan external&#13;
sector, the complaints were nonsensical. For one thing, the oil import bill&#13;
had shot up from 17 percent of exports in 1973 to 43 percent in 1974 despite&#13;
export growth of 8.5 percent a year in those two years. 'L1/ For another,&#13;
since EEC countries had payment difficulties, Uruguay's Leading foreign&#13;
exchange earners, beef and wool, experienced revenues faLling at 12 percent a&#13;
year during the same period. In the lexicon of project evaluation, the shadow&#13;
price of foreign exchange had become so high that almost any fiscal&#13;
expenditure used in promoting exports was justified on social cost-benefit&#13;
grounds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 168 -&#13;
During 1976-78 the external situation improved progressively as the&#13;
real price of oil was falling, while nontraditional exports were increasing&#13;
rapidly and traditional exports were not doing badly. The pressures to reduce&#13;
the export promotion schemes mounted, pressures well grounded in economics&#13;
since the shadow price of foreign exchange was falling. And the incentives&#13;
were indeed pruned, albeit carefully. But it was only by 1978-79, when the&#13;
new anti-inflationary policy was adopted, that credit incentives were severely&#13;
cut to prevent them from becoming a major source of discretionary money&#13;
growth.&#13;
The Evolving Set of Incentives&#13;
The complexity of restrictions and their constant alteration&#13;
throughout the reforms makes it difficult to assess what set of incentives&#13;
firms ended up facing. Table 5-2 looks at prime costs: wages and cost of&#13;
finance. Managers must have benefited from falling real wages, a trend that&#13;
started in the middle 1960s. Only in 1980, whien the economy was overheated&#13;
(and because of political developments toward year-end) did real wages start&#13;
rising again.&#13;
More interesting are the changing costs of finance. Before the&#13;
reforms, whoever had access to capital usuallyt enjoyed negative real terms.&#13;
As shown in table 5-2, this eventually came to an end, though not at the same&#13;
time for all producers. Nontraditional exporters, because of the financial&#13;
subsidies they received, were able to reap a financial subsidy until 1981.&#13;
Import-competitors had to start paying positive real interest rates in 1980&#13;
when the inflation spurt in 1979 abated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 169 -&#13;
But firms' decisions about financial structure wiere also affected by&#13;
other reform-related events. First, the opening of the eiconomy to two-way&#13;
capital flows as well as events in Argentina led to sustained capital inflows&#13;
throughout the reforms. The liquidity of the economy rose, thereby providing&#13;
the opportunity for firms to rely more heavily on debt finance.&#13;
Matters were further complicated with the preannouncement of the rate&#13;
of devaluation (up to six months in advance while most borrowing was for&#13;
periods between one month and six months) between January 1979 and November&#13;
1982. As shown in table 5-2, a substantial positive ex-post peso-dollar&#13;
spread developed. To shift toward dollar-denominated debt must have been&#13;
tempting, although a restraining influence was certainly exerted by prospects&#13;
of a devaluation -- especially after Argentina restored its competitiveness&#13;
around the middle of 1981. (Summaries of interviews below also indicate that&#13;
it was not always easy to negotiate one's way out of dollar debt with banks&#13;
when expectations of a devaluation rose.)&#13;
Dismantling a protective system that had increased in complexity&#13;
during a century was difficult in Uruguay because of the political interests&#13;
it had given rise to. Figure 5-1 shows the evolution of f'ormal nominal&#13;
protection and implicit protection (which is the difference between the&#13;
domestic price and the border price expressed in pesos) of' comparable import&#13;
products. The extent of redundant protection is approxima,ted by the&#13;
difference between the formal and implicit rates.  The estimates come from the&#13;
CINVE (1983) study which relied on price comparisons for 141 products that&#13;
covered 80 percent of manufacturing production in 1981. T'he estimates suggest&#13;
that redundant protection only disappeared around 1981 (irL that year there was&#13;
negative redundant protection for eight of 20 two-digit ISIC industries). The&#13;
graph also shows a small rise in implicit protection between 1978 and 1982 in&#13;
&#13;

spite of the reduction in formal protection. This occurred because of the&#13;
short-run upward pressure on domestic prices caused by Argentine aggregate&#13;
demand. But this pressure is much attenuated if one considers that the real&#13;
exchange rate was approximately in equilibrium in 1978 and corrects for the&#13;
implicit subsidy to imports that resulted from the 28-perc/ent real exchange&#13;
rate appreciation between 1978 and 1981.&#13;
But even though nominal and redundant protection was falling rapidly,&#13;
effective protection remained high. In 1981, realized effective protection&#13;
for domestic sales was 75 percent while protection for export sales was only&#13;
30 percent (table 5-3). Thus, the bias against export sales was still 34&#13;
percent in spite of the rapid fall in protection between 11978 and 1980.&#13;
Indeed, when correcting for exchange rate appreciation, protection for export&#13;
sales was -5.0 percent (although vis-a-vis Argentina the situation was&#13;
different as the bilateral real exchange rate with Argentina rose by 13&#13;
percent between 1978 and 1980 before falling by 52 percent between year-end&#13;
1980 and year-end 1981). In sum, throughout the reforms, the system of&#13;
incentives still favored production for the domestic market rather than&#13;
production for exports.&#13;
Table 5-3 also shows that reference prices (aforos) raised&#13;
significantly the formal rate of protection (and that their importance did not&#13;
change between 1978 and 1981). This confirms that reference prices often&#13;
continued to be set above the price of the comparable international product.&#13;
It is also apparent (cable 5.3(a) that protection fell most rapidly during&#13;
1978-80 -- that is, before the announcement of the tariff reform. Protection&#13;
rates increased in 1982 because of the June 1982 decree which raised tariffs&#13;
and subsidies across-the-board by 10 percent. Finally, table 5.3(b) shows&#13;

4. How Firms Assessed the Shocks and Adjusted Their Ociperations&#13;
How would one expect firms to have adjusted to this new environment? The&#13;
macroeconomic evolution suggests that a fairly clear break in how both&#13;
exporting and import-substituting firms viewed the outside world should be&#13;
expected sometime around 1979. And by late 1981 and early 1982 all firms&#13;
producing tradable goods must have been simultaneously hit by high (domestic&#13;
and foreign) interest rates, and by a falling real exchange rate. Would-be&#13;
exporters were also suffering from the international recession while producers&#13;
for the domestic market withstood the depressed state of demand at home. And&#13;
while exporters saw reintegros and preferential credit whittLed down to&#13;
nothing, tariff cuts determined that much domestic demand went to imported&#13;
goods. 12/&#13;
The timing of the break nevertheless had to be diff(erent for&#13;
exporters and import-substituters. Exporting firms that could not easily&#13;
export to Argentina (like the leather industry) faced difficulties in 1980&#13;
with the combined impact of the atraso cambiario and cuts in export-promotion&#13;
measures. But firms that could export to Argentina would expand strongly&#13;
until mid-1981 and then join domestic-oriented producers in a headlong&#13;
downswing for at least 18 months.&#13;
One must also take into account the appreciation of the Argentine&#13;
peso between 1979 and early 1981. This must have allowed maniy firms that had&#13;
been exporting to several countries to concentrate on selling to Argentinians&#13;
alone, for they were losing their competitive edge at home and in all foreign&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 174 -&#13;
markets but Buenos Aires. Some exporters must have changed the lines of goods&#13;
produced to suit a different market, but most seem to have substituted markets&#13;
without major changes in product lines. Thus, real disprotection of tradable-&#13;
goods production operated only from the initial devaluations in Argentina&#13;
to November 1982, some 18 months. Only during that period, should one expect&#13;
to see, as in Chile, some move toward importing and some narrowing the number&#13;
of goods produced. One would thus expect to find some firms that began&#13;
exporting after, say, 1974 -- and possibly some more that began importing by,&#13;
say, 1980-81.&#13;
Given the small Uruguayan market, one would also expect that the&#13;
passage from import substitution to export promotion might involve some rise&#13;
in the efficiency with which resources were used, along the lines of&#13;
Leibenstein's (1966) x-efficiency argument.&#13;
The Questionnaires&#13;
Eight interviews were in January 1983, three in September. At both&#13;
times, almost all firms were in difficult situations. In January 1983, not&#13;
even exporting firms had begun to take advantage of the large devaluation of&#13;
November 1982. Interviews were based on a questionnaire applied to the person&#13;
in the firm who took the relevant decisions during the reform period. In most&#13;
cases, this entrepreneurial role had been divided among two or more persons&#13;
and interviews with them tended to be richer because of the interaction&#13;
between interviewees. 13/&#13;
Inflation-adjusted yearly income and balance sheet statements (for&#13;
1973-81) were available for four firms we visited. 14/ The following&#13;
financial indicators are graphed for each of those firms:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 175 -&#13;
(1) Gross margin: Gross sales less operating costs (intermediate inputs,&#13;
labor and depreciation) as a percentage of gross sales.&#13;
(2) Operating margin: Gross margin less overhead expenses (as a&#13;
percentage of gross sales).&#13;
(3) Net earnings: Operating margin less financial costs per unit of&#13;
gross sales (financial costs are corrected for the shrinkage of net&#13;
monetary assets caused by inflation).&#13;
(4) Gearing: Debt/assets, measures leverage.&#13;
(5)  Net foreign assets:  Net foreign assets/debt, measures foreign&#13;
currency exposure.&#13;
The first three indicators show earnings profiles per unit of- sales before and&#13;
after financial costs, and the last two indicate leverage and debt&#13;
composition.&#13;
The Sample&#13;
Of the 11 firms interviewed (see table 5-4) three were subsidiaries&#13;
of large foreign conglomerates, three were locally incorporated firms of&#13;
diffuse ownership, one was part of the largest national economic group, one&#13;
was "mostly a family affair" (by which they meant that a famnily owns most of&#13;
the stock but pays heed to the opinions of a couple of other stockholders who&#13;
happen to be old friends) and three were strictly family afifairs.&#13;
Three firms were large (two of the family firms and the one belonging&#13;
to a local group) 15/ in the sense that they had sales of at least $25 million&#13;
in 1980, 1981 or 1982. Four firms were medium-size, selling more than $10&#13;
million but less than $25 million a year:  a multinational which is large if&#13;

clothing and both producers of textiles earned at least half their income by&#13;
exporting. The other four firms produced capital (electrical machinery) or&#13;
intermediate goods (steel products, automobile parts for intercambio&#13;
compensado 16/, and fertilizers). Of these, the latter two made all or almost&#13;
all their sales abroad.&#13;
Firm A, a subsidiary of a very large multinational based in the&#13;
United States, was originally active in steel making, refining, and&#13;
manufacturing. As happened to most of those firms, the parent company has&#13;
expanded activities and is now a full-fledged conglomerate. The parent&#13;
company has, among other subdivisions, a Latin American regional division that&#13;
acts as a sort of supramanagement for the Uruguayan subsidiary. This regional&#13;
structure enables several Latin American subsidiaries to be fairly independent&#13;
of the parent company in the United States, especially in their financing.&#13;
Both the domestic firm manager and the regional manager coincided in that the&#13;
mere fact of the firm belonging to the conglomerate ensures ready access to&#13;
both Uruguayan and foreign banks, even when the parent company guarantee is&#13;
not made explicit. This proves to be a significant advantage for the firm.&#13;
Total sales of this firm in 1982 were about $9 million.&#13;
Firm B is largely a family concern despite being incorporated. It is&#13;
the largest Uruguayan producer and exporter of leather manufactures and it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 178 -&#13;
specializes in three lines of production: clothing in leather, clothing in&#13;
woollen cloth, and clothing made of sheepskin. Sales by this firm in 1982&#13;
were about $13 million.&#13;
Firm C is a local corporation with a fairly widespread body of&#13;
shareholders. Established in 1971, it has very strong ties with Argentine&#13;
firms through the mechanism called intercambio compensado, though it is not&#13;
part of a group. The mechanism, oriented only to the car industry, enables&#13;
Uruguayan automotive firms to import if they in turn export a given proportion&#13;
of the dollars they import. This firm produces harnesses of electrical cables&#13;
for automobiles which are locally called chicotes. Strongly export-oriented,&#13;
it sold $3.5 million in 1980, $1.3 million in 1931, and less than $700,000 in&#13;
1982.&#13;
Firm D, also strongly export-oriented, is a family concern&#13;
established in the late 1960s. Its main production lines are industrial&#13;
electrical transformers and electric motors, and it sold $3.5 million in 1981&#13;
and $3 million in 1982.&#13;
Firm E is a locally incorporated firm, with half its shares belonging&#13;
to six shareholding families, the rest to several dozen smaller sharehol-&#13;
ders. It is the oldest, largest, and best-established of all wool-textile&#13;
firms. There are two large groups of textile firms in Uruguay: those using&#13;
wool and those using cotton and synthetic fibers. These two groups behave&#13;
differently depending on the cost of their raw materials and on the vagaries&#13;
of demand for the goods they produce. Firm E had sales between $10 and $20&#13;
million in 1981 and 1982, 75 percent of which went to foreign markets.&#13;
Firm E's earnings performance (figure 5-2a) improved up until 1977.&#13;
Clearly, earnings performance improved greatly during the period of strong&#13;
export incentives (1975-77). Net earnings show a decline during the period&#13;

when the real exchange rate appreciated (1980-81)'. Even though firm E managed&#13;
to have negative financial costs in 1981, it did so by increasing its exposure&#13;
in dollars (figure 5-2b). Indeed, of the four firms for which we have&#13;
financial indicators, firm E had the highest exposure in foreign-currency-&#13;
denominated debt. If we had data for 1982, then this firm's net earnings&#13;
situation at year-end would have been much worse because of the capital loss&#13;
on the dollar-denominated debt caused by the November 1982 devaluation.&#13;
Firm F is the only one in the sample belonging to a group. Since the&#13;
group assembled, the firm was at the center and it has imported automobiles&#13;
since 1981 which are sold through the group's five commercial outlets. After&#13;
several years of stable automotive policy, this firm -- and the group --&#13;
suffered a severe setback through a decree of April 1980. As a result, its&#13;
sales of some $85 million in 1980 fell to only $2i) million in 1982.&#13;
The earnings trajectory for Firm F, the automobile assembler&#13;
indicates very low gross margins and also low opeirating margins as&#13;
administrative costs are fairly high (figure 5-3a). But the pattern is&#13;
clear: as one would expect, the automobile assembler is having trouble to&#13;
adjust. Indeed if it were not for a high leverage and and an increasing&#13;
dollar exposure -- both of which contributed to maintain low (or negative)&#13;
financial costs -- the situation would have been worse.&#13;
Firm G is a subsidiary of a multinational active in textiles and&#13;
based in the United States. To our knowledge, this multinational is not a&#13;
conglomerate, and the subsidiaries produce the same goods as the parent&#13;
company. The Uruguayan subsidiary is one of the large textile groups that&#13;
work with cotton and synthetic fibers and thus provides some comparison with&#13;
firm E. Despite being multinational, firm C suffered severely in the recent&#13;
crunch: in the second half of 1982 it shut down and sent all its workers to&#13;

the seguro de paro for unemployment insurance. In January 1983 the firm&#13;
partially reopened with hopes of exporting raised by the massive devaluation&#13;
of November 1982. In 1974 its exports were below 10 percent of the firm's&#13;
sales. By 1982 half its sales were exports, mostly because domestic sales&#13;
fell swiftly as Uruguayan buyers switched to Buenos Aires. During 1972-78&#13;
firm G had average annual sales of $50 million. Sales plummeted to $30&#13;
million in 1980 and then to $10 million in 1982.&#13;
Unfortunately the earnings trajectory for firm G (figure 5-4a) does&#13;
not extend to 1982 since most Uruguayan firms close their accounts at mid-&#13;
year. Thus the effects of declining demand on gross and operating margins do&#13;
not appear in 1981. This is why the trajectordies for firm G are much smoother&#13;
than for other firms. A striking feature, however, is firm G's high&#13;
administrative costs. We were not surprised to learn from a colleague who&#13;
visited the firm in August 1984 that the firm was able to start operating&#13;
again by drastically reducing its administrative personnel by two-thirds.&#13;
Another interesting comparison is operating margins and net earnings as&#13;
interest rates turned positive in 1980 and especially in 1981. Because firm G&#13;
avoided dollar debt, it could not shield itself from the effect of rising peso&#13;
interest rates and, by 1981, net earnings were less than 2 percent. In fact,&#13;
only because of its low leverage (figure 5-4b) did the firm escape negative&#13;
net earnings in 1981.&#13;
Firm H, the largest product of large appliances, is a locally&#13;
incorporated firm, belonging mostly to a single family which has lived in&#13;
Uruguay for three generations. It is an old firm whLich was traditionally&#13;
managed until the early 1970s. It had fair profits for several decades. By&#13;
the early 1970s, both ownership and management were overtaken by people in&#13;
their early thirties, introducing big changes that coincided with the&#13;

reforms. Its adjustment process is thus very interesting. Oriented to the&#13;
domestic market, the firm sold $16 million in 1979, $33 million in both 1980&#13;
and 1981, and $24 million in 1982.&#13;
The beneficial impact of managerial overhaul is clearly reflected in&#13;
its earnings trajectory (figure 5-5a). Starting in 1976 operating margins&#13;
became positive for the first time mostly by improvement in gross margins.&#13;
But, large overhead costs (suspiciously constant throughout) with falling&#13;
gross margins resulted in negative operating mnargins as early as 1980. As&#13;
expected, the appliance producer was adverselyr afflected by reduced trade&#13;
barriers. Net earnings turned negative when interest rates turned positive&#13;
due to fairly high leverage and low dollar exposure (figure 5-5b). Of the&#13;
f our firms examined here, firm H showed positive financial costs for the most&#13;
sustained periods of time. In spite of a large portfolio shift toward dollar-&#13;
denominated debt in 1980-81, firm H could not shield itself from rising&#13;
f inancial costs which brought down net earnings per unit net worth to about&#13;
-10 percent by 1981.&#13;
Firm I is a small family-held local corporation. The firm has close&#13;
commercial ties with a very large importer and wholesale distributor of&#13;
foodstuffs, a relationship accounting for firmi I's fairly easy access to&#13;
credit. But this access was in practice an unused safeguard, for the firm's&#13;
success during 1979-83 was attributed to its getting rid of almost all its&#13;
debts very quickly, partly through increasing capital, partly by very&#13;
stringent internal financial practices, when the authorities announced their&#13;
intention of ensuring high real interest rates. Firm I produces whisky from&#13;
imported Scotch malts. Surprisingly it thrived during the apertura period:&#13;
in 1972 it sold 20 percent of all domestic whisky consumed in the country, and&#13;
62 percent in 1982.  Its share of imports rose from nothing to 32 percent in&#13;

1982, and its share of a rapidly expanding market rose from 20 to 42&#13;
percent. This firm is, however, still small, with sales of less than $7&#13;
million in 1982.&#13;
Firm J belongs wholly to a family that has been heavily involved in&#13;
the tobacco industry for many years. Since 1.979 it withstood heavy competi-&#13;
tion from a wholly-owned subsidiary of one oL the largest multinational&#13;
tobacco concerns. The foreign-based firm disrupted previously existing&#13;
"gentlemen's agreements" and introduced high-pressure competition, a fact&#13;
bitterly resented by firm J. But firm J has managed to stand its ground well&#13;
and has increased its share of the market in both cigarettes and ground&#13;
tobacco. There are almost no imports, but smuggling from Brazil is held to be&#13;
growing very fast and total consumption has also fallen dramatically with the&#13;
country's economic woes of 1982. With sales of some $67 million, this firm is&#13;
the largest in the sample.&#13;
Firm K, formerly a subsidiary of a foreign group, went broke at the&#13;
beginning of the 1980s as a result of the agricultural slump which affected&#13;
the market for fertilizers. The firm began having trouble in 1970-72 when&#13;
farmers heeded government plans to expand greatly the area under agricultural&#13;
exploitation (particularly soybean), thus requiring huge increases in domestic&#13;
production of fertilizers to avoid imports. Firm K then expanded its&#13;
capacity, but the increase in agricultural production never materialized and&#13;
it immediately ran into trouble. By 1979, when the foreign market for&#13;
Uruguayan beef also collapsed, cattle raisers also cut back drastically on&#13;
their use of fertilizer and the firm's troubles got worse. All this is&#13;
superimposed on the firm's belief that primary fertilizers cannot be&#13;
economically produced for so small a market. It then reduced margins to&#13;
enlarge its share of the market, a successful endeavor until rising interest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

rates induced unbearably high financial costs. After the shLutdown in mid-&#13;
1980, the firm continued to sell its fertilizer stock for almost two years.&#13;
The Assessment of Shocks&#13;
The firms did quite well (or even very well) during 1974-78, but they&#13;
were in trouble in 1979-82. Beginning with the devaluation of November 1982,&#13;
many began to feel doomed because they faced net indebtedness in foreign&#13;
currency. Others saw glimmers of hope because of the consequent increase in&#13;
expected profitability in the production of tradable goods. Firms that could&#13;
export were the largest beneficiaries: for instance, by June 1983 firm E was&#13;
back to three shifts -- with extremely high profitability and with the share&#13;
of exports in total sales "higher than ever."&#13;
Table 5-5 summarizes responses to questions about the external&#13;
shocks. Responses labeled A1 through A15 were favorable shocks while B1&#13;
through B14 were negative shocks. Because interviewees were asked to date&#13;
their responses, simple perusal of table 5-5 shows that seclion A of the table&#13;
is frequently dated 1974-78, section B, 1979-82.&#13;
The responses are consistent with a liberalization model aimed at&#13;
growth (as in 1974-78) and a stabilization model aimed at containing inflation&#13;
(since 1979). The loss in profitability of firms producing; tradable goods was&#13;
then seen by economic authorities as mainly an external balance problem. This&#13;
problem was discounted with the thought that domestic interest rates would&#13;
ensure enough capital inflows to maintain reserves well above minimum&#13;
acceptable levels. Two important things were left out. The first was that&#13;
sticky prices (made stickier by the presence of redundant protection and&#13;
strong aggregate demand) -- along with large costs of relocating capital and&#13;
labor -- would preclude full employment.  The second was that the high debt&#13;

service/exports ratio (prompted first by capital inflows, later by capital&#13;
flight) would at some stage lead to capital outflows. These aspects, however,&#13;
were felt by domestic entrepreneurs and eventually by foreign lenders.  This&#13;
introduces the issue of policy credibility and the firms' reactions to shocks,&#13;
to which we will turn.&#13;
As in Chile and Argentina, the value of the real exchange rate&#13;
affected the profitability of tradable goods production in Uruguay. For the&#13;
authorities of these countries and for their critics, the exchange rate became&#13;
paramount to the point of obscuring the parallel role -- for the profitability&#13;
of tradable-goods production -- of changes in tariffs, reintegros, and credit&#13;
and tax incentives.&#13;
The last two columns of table 5-5 give a summary average weight for&#13;
each shock and its corresponding ranking. Of the positive shocks, the&#13;
improved definition of the rules-of-the-road leads the way. This was followed&#13;
by (1) the opportunity to introduce new technology (when the ban on imports of&#13;
capital goods was lifted), (2) the relaxation of domestic price controls;&#13;
(3) the reduction of barriers on imports of raw materials; aLnd (4) the&#13;
increase in reintegros. For exporters, the reintegros, credit incentives, and&#13;
the exchange rate were paramount, as one would expect. Perusal of the first&#13;
part of table 5-5 also shows most of the positive answers to be time-qualified&#13;
(1974-78 or thereabouts).&#13;
Shocks numbered A-12 ("less competition from domestic producers"), A-&#13;
14 ("lifting of restrictions on obtaining foreign 'know-how"'), A-1 ("changes&#13;
in labor legislation"), and A-2 ("better financing of working capital") were&#13;
awarded the least weight among positive shocks.&#13;
Of the negative shocks, the poorer definition of the rules-of-the-&#13;
road (in 1979-82) leads the way with the real revaluation of the peso very&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 190 -&#13;
close behind and the fall in "reintegros" coming in a very close third.&#13;
Slightly further behind is the increase in the cost of working capital, and a&#13;
very distant fifth is the increase in labor costs outstripping those in the&#13;
product price. All those hurt by the measures affecting the profitability of&#13;
exports complained about the period 1979-82 -- particularly to the increasing&#13;
lack of credibility of the tablita after 1980. Complaints about the November&#13;
1982 devaluation that occurred after many stout denials is not surprising,&#13;
since as we have seen earlier, most firms were increasing their exposure in&#13;
dollars.&#13;
Reactions of Firms to External Shocks&#13;
The typical response to measures that reduced the profitability of&#13;
exports was that firms "retrenched awaiting better days" (the expression was&#13;
used by an interviewee). Retrenchment meant cutting costs mostly by investing&#13;
in new equipment and techniques as well as by rationalizing production. In&#13;
two cases, rationalization involved dropping some production lines to expand&#13;
others. But in general it seems to have meant tightening up on whatever slack&#13;
there was. Firms also pointed out that they managed to export fairly well,&#13;
first to Brazil and later to Argentina. 17/ A third fairly typical response&#13;
was that firms' operations were affected by the specific measures that were&#13;
changing at least once a year. Thus even though firms believed that the real&#13;
exchange rate appreciation was untenable in the medium run, they had to adjust&#13;
in the short run, accepting each new instrument as it came. 18/ For example,&#13;
firm J tended to react immediately to seize any profitable opportunity and to&#13;
avoid any loss, depending on the case.&#13;
The rise in interest rates after 1978-79 also hit firms very hard.&#13;
Interviewees argue that they reacted immediately on four fronts: turning to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 191 -&#13;
dollar loans (with an implicit short-run faith in the "tablita" which paid off&#13;
handsomely for a time), sharply reducing inventories, reducing credit to&#13;
customers, and devoting more time and effort to bargaining with the banks for&#13;
better terms.&#13;
Because of the generally unanimous position of having reacted quickly&#13;
to almost all measures, questions 2 through 5 of this section elicited few&#13;
responses. One exception is firm C, a textile concern that had to shut down&#13;
for several months in 1982. Its executives later said that they miscalculated&#13;
their own capacity to sustain prolonged losses. The combination of real&#13;
exchange rate revaluation and very high interest rates (even in dollars in&#13;
1981 and early 1982) was heavier than they had projected. If they had&#13;
projected correctly, they would have accelerated reduction in product variety,&#13;
increased reliance on exports, and stopped ongoing modernizaLtion to avoid&#13;
increased dollar indebtedness. Even so, if their external markets had held up&#13;
instead of going into deep recession, they would have been able to remain open&#13;
with no interruptions until the end of the tablita. In early 1983 the&#13;
devaluation meant that this firm could manage to reopen, albeit modestly&#13;
employing only about 20 percent of its normal work force. By mid-1983 (when&#13;
the other textile firm had gone to three shifts) firm C was still struggling,&#13;
mainly because they process imported synthetic fibers and cotton rather than&#13;
domestic wool.&#13;
Another exception is firm F, the automobile assembler. After years&#13;
of policy stability, the assembly industry was surprised in April 1980 by a&#13;
decree that authorized the import of completed cars, relieved importers of&#13;
complete cars of the obligation to proceed with intercambio compensado, and&#13;
fixed maximum prices for locally assembled cars while maintaining free prices&#13;
for imports. In late 1979 the firm had embarked on an ambitious expansion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 192 -&#13;
program under apparently very solid guarantees of policy stability from all&#13;
policy makers involved. It was told that from 1980 only the ten models most&#13;
sold in 1979 would be allowed to remain.  This framework, known as "the race,"&#13;
quickly developed into frantic price-cutting as all assemblers tried to&#13;
maximize quantity even at the expense of short-run profitability.&#13;
Firm F managed to place several of its models among the top ten, so&#13;
its optimism seemed to be well-founded. Unsurprisingly, it could not believe&#13;
that the April 1980 decree -- which abruptly changed the legal framework --&#13;
would last long. During several months firm F devoted all its energies to&#13;
overturning the decree rather than to adjusting; to it. In addition, the&#13;
expansion plans very much tied up its cash flow and only by the end of 1981&#13;
did it join the rush toward direct imports. Between 1978 and 1982 firm F lost&#13;
10 of its 35 percentage points in market share for cars and trucks, 60 of its&#13;
100 percentage points for semi-completed cars, and 20 of its 30 percentage&#13;
points for automotive parts.&#13;
The third exception is firm K. The foreign group to which it belongs&#13;
runs a center for economic studies for its firms, and this center held that&#13;
the tablita policy was untenable and would be short-lived. So, firm K held on&#13;
until mid-1980; during those 18 months the atraso cambiario led the group to&#13;
make new investments to avoid shutting down without bankruptcy proceedings.&#13;
The question of ambiguities or contradictions in policy elicited many&#13;
responses. Different firms gave so many different examples that we only&#13;
attempt to report a few of them here. The contradictions reported tend to&#13;
concentrate in the later period, but this may reflect selective memory. The&#13;
worst example of inconsistency probably is that of the automobile assembler&#13;
recounted above. Another example is firm C that went ahead at full steam in&#13;
its export promotion effort, counting on the special reintegro and other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 193 -&#13;
export promotion measures approved in June 1982, only to have them withdrawn&#13;
in September. The shift in Uruguayan demand for textiles to Buenos Aires in&#13;
the second half of 1982 (the counterpart of what had happened in 1978-80)&#13;
exceeded the firm's resilience, and it shut down for some months.&#13;
How should these responses be evaluated? Managers perceived that, in&#13;
the long run, a continuation of the 1979-82 falling trend in profitability of&#13;
tradable-goods production was simply untenable. Objectively, they knew those&#13;
trends were incompatible with the continued existence of domestic industry and&#13;
that the trade deficit could not be indefinitely financed from abroad.&#13;
Subjectively, by not shutting down immediately, they were placing their bets&#13;
on the end of the tablita sooner rather than later -- at least no later than&#13;
the end of their capacity to sustain losses. Three firms were wrong in this&#13;
last judgment. One shut down in 1980, and two others did so, for several&#13;
months, in 1982. Firm C, a producer of electrical automotive parts, reopened&#13;
in September 1982 after the hidden devaluation of June 1982: a 10 percent&#13;
surtax of all imports and a 10-point increase in reintegros. 19/ Firm C&#13;
reopened in December in response to the massive November devaluation. All&#13;
other firms remained open during the whole period. Only to this extent did&#13;
firms not adjust to the long-run policy incentives -- which, in view of the&#13;
November devaluation, certainly suggests they had the right expectations. 20/&#13;
We found no other trace of firms thwarting government actions by&#13;
adopting a stance based on a disbelief in policy. In almost all cases, what&#13;
entrepreneurs conveyed was the sense of having had extremely little room for&#13;
choice. As in other experiences in the Southern Cone -- both past and recent&#13;
-- when economic authorities decided to implement a course of action, they&#13;
left few doubts about their intention, and extremely low profit opportunities&#13;
remained outside the chosen path. For instance, when the government began to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 194 -&#13;
implement its export-led growth strategy in 1973-74, it made high reintegros&#13;
available to all nontraditional exporters, adding credit and tax incentives,&#13;
and significantly expanding the role of government in promoting commercial&#13;
export channels. To discourage production for the home market at the same&#13;
time, it began to reduce tariff and paratariff protection to domestic industry&#13;
and proceeded with orthodox stabilization at home by severely curtailing all&#13;
official credit lines to domestic-oriented producers.  That firms "got the&#13;
message" is indicated by the fact that manufactured exports grew 45 percent a&#13;
year between 1973 and 1977. 21/ Furthermore, manufactured exports shot up by&#13;
57 percent in 1974 alone, albeit from a low base.&#13;
The same was true when the policy changed in late 1978. Most firms,&#13;
faced with a fall in their projected profitability, took up efforts to&#13;
rationalize production by modernizing plant and cutting costs. It is somewhat&#13;
surprising, however, that, with the exception of one firm, cost-cutting did&#13;
not take the form of reduced administrative costs.&#13;
To a large extent, many firms that would otherwise have been forced&#13;
out of business much earlier were kept afloat until mid-1981 by events in&#13;
Argentina. As explained earlier, Uruguayan firms were faced with a textbook&#13;
case of infinitely elastic demand and negligible or nonexistent transport&#13;
costs. Because the Argentine currency was much more overvalued than the&#13;
Uruguayan, it was almost always easy to have costs below the Argentine market&#13;
price. By mid-1981, however, the Argentine market began to crumble, the&#13;
international market was entering deep recession, and the Uruguayan industries&#13;
began to face serious problems. From mid-1981 tc mid--1982 (when tariffs and&#13;
reintegros were raised) the basic disbelief in "the model" surfaced. Rather&#13;
then shut down in the face of prospectively large losses, most firms remained&#13;
open, betting on the demise of the tablita.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 195 -&#13;
In doing so, however, they faced an additional problem because the&#13;
institutions that more clearly disbelieved the tablita were the banks.  Since&#13;
early 1982, both domestic and foreign banks were doing their best to take only&#13;
peso deposits while making only dollar loans. Naturally, nonfinancial firms&#13;
were playing the opposite game. The result was a fall both in real credit to&#13;
the private sector (in both domestic and foreign currency) and in deposits by&#13;
the private sector (because of capital flight). As depositors shifted from&#13;
peso-denominated to dollar denominated deposits in anticipation of the demise&#13;
of the tablita, banks renewed their loans in dollars and wisely chose to raise&#13;
their dollar reserves and switch from a net position in dollars to a net&#13;
position in pesos (see Hanson and de Melo, 1985, table 5-3). Firms that were&#13;
making losses and were in need of significant amounts of working capital had&#13;
to take these dollar-denominated loans. All firms that could do so turned&#13;
more intensely than ever to exports as a self-imposed exchange rate insurance.&#13;
As stated earlier, most entrepreneurs felt that the tablita was&#13;
untenable in the long run.  But on November 24, 1982, the tablita had three&#13;
more months to go, since it had been announced until the end of February. The&#13;
President had recently said in public that only "visitors from Mars" would&#13;
believe in a devaluation, and the official line was that the extension of the&#13;
tablita would be announced shortly. Despite their long-run disbelief, all&#13;
interviewees thought that there was almost no doubt about having the tablita&#13;
survive until the end of February and a fair likelihood of having it continue&#13;
some months beyond that date, though probably at a faster pace. They chose to&#13;
"stay the course" because of the increase in tariffs and reintegros in June&#13;
1982 and because the prefinancing of manufactured exports introduced in&#13;
September had been of some help.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 196 -&#13;
On November 25, 1982, the peso was floated: it sank from 13 per&#13;
dollar to 30 in December and to 45 in early January. The subsequent fall in&#13;
the exchange rate to 26 by mid-January in the wake of the central bank's&#13;
doubling the banks' reserve requirements (again, it was mainly the banks that&#13;
were betting on a higher future exchange rate and making their prophecy a&#13;
self-fulfilling one by buying heavily) renewed doubts about the future&#13;
course. Then the exchange rate crept up to 30 in the next two weeks. The&#13;
central bank's announcement -- after those massive swings -- that the exchange&#13;
rate would continue to float "until it found its own level" did nothing to&#13;
induce confidence. So, widespread disbelief in short-term management, a&#13;
phenomenon not obviously present in the period before the devaluation, was now&#13;
declared to be prevalent by most interviewees.&#13;
Adjustments in the Firms' Operations&#13;
Unlike what one wouLd have expected on the basis of Chilean&#13;
experience is that, after almost ten years of economic reforms, not one firm&#13;
introduced drastic changes in its three leading products. But this is not so&#13;
surprising if one recalls that redundant protection was eliminated in Chile as&#13;
early as 1977, while it persisted in Uruguay until 1981. There were, however,&#13;
large quantitative changes in the sense of one or two products making&#13;
significant gains in their share of firm sales, and in two cases, two of the&#13;
three largest products were introduced after the reforms. But there were no&#13;
cases in which the leading product was dropped altogether during the period of&#13;
the reforms.&#13;
This pattern is consistent with the form adopted by the Uruguayan&#13;
apertura process -- the passage from import substitution toward export&#13;
promotion while maintaining sufficient protection for domestic sales. Firms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 197 -&#13;
used exports to expand production of one or two of their best-established&#13;
lines, thus explaining why the share of different lines in total output almost&#13;
always changed. Dramatic changes in output composition aLre to be expected&#13;
only as a result of extreme changes in the variance of effective rates of&#13;
protection, such as those that happen when a "made-to-measure" tariff system&#13;
is replaced by a flat tariff, as was the case in Chile. In Uruguay, the&#13;
appreciation of the real exchange rate led to disprotection of tradable&#13;
activities. But differences in protection across products remained largely&#13;
unaffected so that fewer changes in output composition took place than would&#13;
have been prompted by a differential reduction of protection as in Chile.&#13;
Firms told us that they made important changes in their production&#13;
strategy -- in essence, a reorientation of sales and an effort to modernize&#13;
with a view to reducing costs and improving quality. This must be interpreted&#13;
for a country where, for more than a decade before the beginning of the&#13;
reforms, growth was sluggish, industrial exports a rarity, and the rate of&#13;
investment low. The apertura period -- both when it was aimed at export-led&#13;
growth and, later, when the competition from imports began -- induced the&#13;
technical innovation which explains why the investment rate almost doubled&#13;
during the 1970s (table 5-1).&#13;
Part of the spurt in innovation was caused by the lifting of the 1972&#13;
ban on imports of capital goods and its sequels. But such lifting might have&#13;
meant little were it not for the stimulus given by competition. A fairly&#13;
typical case is that of firm H, which sold only in the domestic market and was&#13;
forced by foreign competition to renew its 40-year old stock of stamping&#13;
molds, thus generating a drastic change in the vintage of the models&#13;
produced. Firm I took advantage of import liberalization to import more and&#13;
better malts to improve quality. It also lengthened the aging and moved their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 198 -&#13;
reserves from cash to aging whisky. Firms that turned to exports had faced&#13;
similar changes starting around 1974. 22/ There is little if any evidence of&#13;
the type of changes associated with an apertura process where the leading&#13;
instrument was very rapid tariff reduction, as in Chile.&#13;
During the Vegh-Villegas period, the main form of adjustment was&#13;
turning to exports. Firm G, set up decades ago as a subsidiary of a large&#13;
textile multinational, produced mainly for the domestic market until the mid-&#13;
1970s. Then, they decided to double the share of exports in total sales to&#13;
around 40 percent and began implementing the corresponding investment plans.&#13;
These involved significant changes in order to adapt to foreign tastes.&#13;
Unfortunately, they never achieved their 40 percent target, because atraso&#13;
cambiario set in by the time they were ready to increase exports.  As stated&#13;
earlier, retrenchment was the main form of adjustment during 1979-82. Many&#13;
returned to selling locally; in particular, both textile firms profited from&#13;
the Argentina-based sales boom of 1979-80 -- and paid dearly for its reversal&#13;
in 1981-82.&#13;
A third important area of adjustment -- general tightening of&#13;
inventories and changes in pricing and marketing policy -- came in response to&#13;
the rise in interest rates after 1978-79. Like the other decisions, this one&#13;
suggests the responsiveness of entrepreneurs to new incentives. Changes in&#13;
pricing and marketing policy again bring out the fact that turning to exports&#13;
was the main adjustment for most firms. This implied that pricing decisions&#13;
moved beyond firms' reach, as most exporting firms sell to large buyers who&#13;
set prices with very little room for bargaining.&#13;
Exceptions to the foregoing pattern included the automobile&#13;
assembler, whose prices were fixed by the government in April 1980. Others&#13;
were the appliances producer and the whiskey producer. Both had leeway&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 199 -&#13;
because they sell mostly at home and enjoy considerable market power. Both&#13;
managed to take advantage of the spillover effect generated by the increased&#13;
consumerism accompanying the euphoria resulting from the strong peso and the&#13;
liberalization of imports in 1979-81. Firm I lost some ground to imports, but&#13;
market expansion and taking over domestic competitors' share allowed it to&#13;
significantly increase sales. Firm I upgraded product quality to compete with&#13;
imports.&#13;
Thanks largely to the introduction of imports, firm H added new&#13;
colors, more gadgetry, and prettier and more modern designIs.  In 1980-81 the&#13;
firm lost some of its market share to imports, but its sales of stoves reached&#13;
50,000, up from 20,000 before the reforms. One main change in its pricing&#13;
policy was that until 1979 it had an unspoken agreement with the competition&#13;
and jointly acted as monopolists. In 1980 it opened several price wars to&#13;
push the competition out of the market. 23/ Success in these actions has&#13;
largely been responsible for the firm's performance until the devaluation.&#13;
Labor practices were considered least important, because in several&#13;
cases labor costs were said to be a very minor proportion of total costs (not&#13;
surprising since real wages were falling most of the time). Gains in this&#13;
area were generally related to the destruction of unions in 1972-73 (except&#13;
for one firm that claimed to have had such good relations with its work force&#13;
before the reforms that it lost ground to competitors when unions&#13;
disappeared). Firm J felt that relocating and upgrading its labor force while&#13;
technical change and higher quality products were introduced was a very&#13;
important form of adjustment.&#13;
By contrast, financial adjustments were the most important of all.&#13;
Except for firm A (which is self-financed), all others attached great positive&#13;
impact to more careful financial management. In view of the November 1982&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 200 -&#13;
devaluation, all firms attached a great deal Df importance to the effects of&#13;
the increase in dollar-indebtedness. It should be noted, however, that the&#13;
initial portfolio shift toward dollar-denominated loans in 1979-81 (when they&#13;
were so much cheaper than peso ones) was the ifirm's decision. 24/ But when&#13;
firms began to fear a devaluation in 1982, they found they could not switch&#13;
back to peso loans because banks were unwillinig to lend pesos. The assessment&#13;
of the switch to dollars was generally very negative, but we were unable to&#13;
find out whether managers felt that the gains from having borrowed dollars up&#13;
to November 1982 were really overcompensated by the devaluation-induced&#13;
losses.&#13;
Difficulties in adjusting to the opening up to imports were important&#13;
(though not the most important adjustment) which is unsurprising considering&#13;
the sheltered domestic market in which these firms previously operated.&#13;
Second in difficulty during 1974-79 were changes in production strategy, and&#13;
financial adjustments ran a close third. This ranking was reversed during&#13;
1980-82. Considering that firms had little room to maneouver in bargaining&#13;
for better loan terms, the explanation for this high grading lies in the fact&#13;
that trying -- albeit unsuccessfully -- to solve the financial difficulties&#13;
took up a large share of the entrepreneurs' energies. This is confirmed by&#13;
the fact that financial adjustments move ahead of production strategy during&#13;
1979-82 and are barely behind marketing. Ir both periods, labor practices are&#13;
a distant fourth.&#13;
What about adjustments that had to be reversed due to policy&#13;
changes? The usual answer here was the unsuccessful attempt to switch back to&#13;
borrowing pesos after mid-1981. When the credit incentive to exports was&#13;
reintroduced in September 1982, a firm undertook to buy its raw materials with&#13;
cash down to use the policy incentive to reduce financial costs. But because&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 201 -&#13;
of normal lags, the raw materials had not yet been delivered -- and,&#13;
consequently, the incentive was not collected -- when, along with the November&#13;
devaluation, the incentive was cancelled and the decision to buy cash down had&#13;
to be financed at current bank rates. The case of the automobile assembler,&#13;
of course, showed up once again. Several cases were mentioned in which export&#13;
contracts were signed on the basis of a given level of reintegro and then had&#13;
to be carried out with a lower one. One firm had to postpone (perhaps&#13;
indefinitely) the final stage of a change in its plant layout because the fall&#13;
in the real exchange rate left it out of a foreign bidding it would otherwise&#13;
have won. And so on.&#13;
Three firms undertook imports of the same type of goods they&#13;
produced. One of them was the automobile assembler, whose case has so fre-&#13;
quently come up here. The other two were the appliance producer and the non-&#13;
wool textile producer. The first firm gave as its main reasons the previous&#13;
contact with foreign sellers and the capacity to perform maintenance&#13;
services. The other two -- not subject to price fixing --- added to those&#13;
reasons an even greater stress on the fact that by importing they increased&#13;
their elbow room in determining prices of their own production. For&#13;
appliances, a heavy weight was attached to the distribution and servicing&#13;
mechanisms. All in all, the possibility of taking advantage of lower barriers&#13;
to imports depended significantly on having earlier been active in similar&#13;
production, particularly in durable consumer goods. A big part of that&#13;
reduction in barriers must have been captured by the importer rather than by&#13;
the consumer. After decades of fairly drab national production, the consumer&#13;
was so eager about having access to novel foreign goods that price-conscious-&#13;
ness was severely diminished. It has been held that the consumer felt an&#13;
increase in wealth and in real income when consumer durables became available&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 202 -&#13;
-- a significant fall in price, down from infinity! It is even more likely&#13;
that he suspected this bonanza would not last forever. The same reasoning&#13;
applies to the very high interest rates that accompanied the introduction of&#13;
consumer financing.&#13;
In the pricing decisions before the reforms, COPRIN inevitably took&#13;
precedence and whatever choice firms had was based primarily on competition&#13;
against other domestic producers, with market: share the paramount concern.&#13;
During 1974-79 maintaining or expanding market share in the face of domestic&#13;
competition becomes the leading pricing criterion. As COPRIN largely&#13;
disappeared, competition from imports run a c:lose third and became the leading&#13;
criterion for two firms (nonwool textiles and appliances, unsurprisingly). In&#13;
1981-82 maintaining market share in the face of equally important domestic and&#13;
foreign competition was dominant, but the push from capital costs became&#13;
important, especially for the appliance producer. 25/&#13;
The final question -- whether the reforms, by reducing government&#13;
intervention, had freed some entrepreneurial time and energy from, say,&#13;
lobbying and doing paperwork -- elicited fairly negative responses. The&#13;
general picture, consistent with previous answers, is that the economic&#13;
authorities acted with much discretion and that lobbying was changed only in&#13;
fashion, not in substance. Furthermore, because of the recent swings in&#13;
policy and because of the tightness of severaL of these firms' economic and&#13;
financial situation, various interviewees pointed out that since early 1982&#13;
most of the entrepreneurial activity has been aimed at trying to predict&#13;
economic policy rather than at production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5. Conclusions&#13;
Two phases affected Uruguayan firms during the reforms: the period&#13;
of a redressment of the bias against exportables during 1974-78; and the&#13;
period of exchange-rate-led anti-inflationary policy. During the first&#13;
period, a strong price responsiveness by exportable firms took place and&#13;
Uruguayan growth was export-led. During the second period -- when anti-&#13;
inflationary policy took precedence over long-run growth as a goal -- all&#13;
firms (including those producing non-tradables) experienced large losses in&#13;
profitability, with many shutdowns after Argentina began devaluing in real&#13;
terms after 1981.&#13;
The interviews confirmed that during 1974-78, the policy package that&#13;
included incentives for exporters led to a new set of profitable&#13;
opportunities. Firms rationalized their production activities by greater&#13;
specialization in fewer product lines and cost reductions. Interviewees&#13;
showed that they perceived the set of incentives provided by the reforms to be&#13;
credible at the time. This was consistent with the strong growth of&#13;
manufacturing, and of exports in particular, during this period.&#13;
But interviewees responded overwhelmingly that the anti-inflationary&#13;
program was not credible and that they "retrenched awaiting better days"&#13;
during 1979-82. This attitude was reinforced by the increased uncertainty&#13;
that resulted from several policy reversals. Complaints of yearly changes in&#13;
the rules of the game, and of the policy reversal towards car assemblers in&#13;
1980, are examples of the disconcerting policy reversals firms had to cope&#13;
with during this period.&#13;
Returning to the 1974-79 period, the interviewee confirmed the&#13;
expected benefits from the combination of export incentives along with a&#13;
dismantling of quantitative controls on imports of capital goods and other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 204 -&#13;
non-competitive intermediate products. In addition to a reorientation of&#13;
sales toward foreign markets, interviewees reported drastic changes in their&#13;
production strategy as they modernized their plants to reduce costs and&#13;
improve quality. Reductions in costs were achieved by quality-improving&#13;
investment in new vintage machinery rather t:han by changes in employment&#13;
practices. Because labor costs for the firms were a small fraction of total&#13;
costs in the sample.&#13;

NOTES&#13;
1.       This policy was adopted during, and as a legal consequence of, the&#13;
suspension of civil liberties known as Medidas Prontas de Seguridad (the&#13;
constitutional equivalent of a State of Siege). This suppression of civil&#13;
rights was the forerunner of the politico-military-economic events of the 70s.&#13;
2.       But see J.J. Anchini; J. Caumont and L. Sjaastad, (1978), Instituto&#13;
de Economia, Universidad de la Republica, (1969) and L.A. Faroppa, El&#13;
desarrollo economico del Uruguay (1965).&#13;
3.       During the previous years, de facto devaluation of the commercial&#13;
rate(s) had been performed through a variety of means which gave rise to a&#13;
multiplicity of rates.&#13;
4.       See Wonsewer and Notaro (1980) and Hanson and de Melo (1985).&#13;
5.       The average real exchange during the years prior to 1974 turns out to&#13;
be almost equal to the one prevalent after that date; but as from 1974 its&#13;
variance was much lower.&#13;
6.       Public investment in construction jumped 46 percent in 1978 and then&#13;
fell 8 percent in 1979 and a further 12 percent in 1980. Thqe rise in private&#13;
construction indirectly accounted for a quarter of the CDP expenditure&#13;
increase in 1979 and 1980.&#13;
7.       Mezzera (1980) discusses why these Argentina-based demand spillovers&#13;
generated high inflation in 1979 despite the fact that much of it was directed&#13;
at tradable goods. The paper concluded that this was due not only to the&#13;
sheer difference in size but mainly to the unpredictability of those demand&#13;
spillovers. Because of this unpredictability, even suppliers of tradable&#13;
goods (typically clothing, small electrical appliances, and the like) found&#13;
themselves behaving like suppliers of nontradables --. that is, presenting a&#13;
very steep supply curve.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 206 -&#13;
8.       Because the Buenos Aires market alone is so large relative to that of&#13;
Uruguay, Uruguayan exporting firms were faced with a textbook case of&#13;
infinitely elastic demand. The same happened for import-competing firms when&#13;
droves of Argentinian tourists descended on Utruguayan shops. In addition,&#13;
transport costs to Buenos Aires are extremely low.&#13;
9.       The PPP recommendation would have called for an import exchange rate&#13;
linked to events in Brazil and an export exchange rate linked to events in&#13;
Argentina. The import rate would have had to be devalued rapidly to keep&#13;
domestic industry competitive with that of Brazil; the export rate would have&#13;
had to be revalued drastically to avoid a rush into producing for export to&#13;
Buenos Aires. The foregoing statements assume that both the real devaluation&#13;
in Brazil and the real revaluation in Argentina could not last long while&#13;
resource allocation -- because of the costs involved -- is a medium-term deci-&#13;
sion at least. Because reallocation costs were not even taken into account,&#13;
adopting a transitory double exchange rate was not even considered.&#13;
Strangely, the central bank began to calculate a basket of foreign currencies&#13;
that excluded Argentina and Brazil, despite their being the major trading&#13;
partners!&#13;
10.      At the same time, export taxes on tracditional exports fell by 90&#13;
percent of their initial height between 1973 and 1976 (Bension and Caumont,&#13;
1981).&#13;
11.      By 1977 and 1978 the oil import bill continued to grow but the export&#13;
expansion was so strong that the ratio of oil imports to all exports fell back&#13;
to 37 and 33 percent, respectively. In 1979-80, of course, the 1974-75 oil&#13;
price rise was repeated, but then the foreign exchange situation was more&#13;
comfortable.&#13;
12.      In addition, because everybody could foresee the demise of the&#13;
tablita, many retailers and consumers overstocked in imported goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 207 -&#13;
13.      A practical result of the bad situation of firms was; that&#13;
interviewees poured out their opinions and information so much that one&#13;
interview lasted more than six hours, none less than three.&#13;
14.      This information is drawn from de Melo, Pascale and Tybout (1985) who&#13;
also describe how accounting statements were corrected for inflation.&#13;
15.      Classifying by size of employment, this firm turns out to be medium-&#13;
sized in spite of selling more than any other; because it is mostly an&#13;
assembly plant, this is not surprising. Both sales and empl.oyment refer, in&#13;
all cases, to the peak accounting year which is always around 1980.&#13;
16.      This is a mechanism which allows local automobile assemblers to&#13;
import the necessary kits as long as they export automotive parts covering&#13;
some proportion (which has been variable over time and across cases) of the&#13;
value imported. Assemblers frequently export production bought from small&#13;
parts-producing firms in order to cover their intercambio compensado&#13;
requisites and they usually make a loss in the process - which is over-&#13;
compensated with the profit of selling assembled cars in the domestic market.&#13;
17.      Brazil had an overvalued currency - relative to many Uruguayan export&#13;
costs - until it devalued at the end of 1979. Argentina hacl a severely&#13;
overvalued currency during 1979-81.&#13;
18.      This in no way precluded very active lobbying, of course.&#13;
19.      As regards profitability of production, the elimination of the surtax&#13;
and the special reintegro were overcompensated by the November devaluation.&#13;
Even so, it is unclear whether the firm - which is indebtecd in dollars - can&#13;
long survive this latest policy change.&#13;
20.      It is extremely important to note that every Wednesday the Central&#13;
Bank put out its information sheet which showed that, since mid-81, the Bank's&#13;
foreign reserves fell every week. Thus the overwhelmingly rational expec-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 208 -&#13;
tation of the demise of the tablita was only countered by official statements&#13;
to the contrary.&#13;
21.      According to figures from Direccion Nacional de Comercio Exterior,&#13;
during each year of that period all exports grew by an average 17 percent,&#13;
traditional exports by 2 percent, and the wholea non-traditional block by 42&#13;
percent.&#13;
22.      Measured in constant prices of 1978, private-sector investment in&#13;
machines and equipment grew by almost 29 percent per year during 1973-77 and&#13;
by 28 percent during 1977-80. It went on to fall by 29 percent in 1981 when&#13;
atraso cambiario really bit after the Argentinian devaluations.&#13;
23.      In appliances like stoves and electric water heaters, the price-size&#13;
ratio is low and this affords natural protecticn against imports.&#13;
24.      One must keep in mind that by 1979, total financial apertura mean&#13;
that one could take either currency with no restrictions. It also meant that,&#13;
with slow devaluation, foreign investors could receive high positive returns&#13;
on their dollar investments at the same time that the jump in inflation in&#13;
1979 determined that peso borrowers ended up paying negative real interest&#13;
rates.&#13;
25.      The question about ways in which market share is protected was&#13;
answered with "competitive prices" almost across the board. We could not&#13;

Annex&#13;
The Questionnaire&#13;
The same basic questionnaire was used for the interviews in all three&#13;
countries and consisted of two parts: a quantitative and a qualitative one.&#13;
It turned out that the answers from the quantitative part were very demanding&#13;
on firms' time so the authors relied mainly on the qualitative questionnaire,&#13;
drawing only occasionally on the quantitative part. The authors conducted all&#13;
interviews. Generally, the interviewee was the general manager or a senior&#13;
executive who had worked in the firm throughout the reformi period. The&#13;
questionnaire sent in advance to the interviewees had six parts.&#13;
(1)      Basic parameters of the firm:  This section sougbLt information on&#13;
ownership, organization, branch of activity, sales and market share.&#13;
(2)      Sources of shocks:  This section tried to determine the principal&#13;
changes (favorable or unfavorable) that the reforms caused in the&#13;
firm's environment.&#13;
(3)      Reactions to the shocks:  This part of the questionnaire tried to&#13;
determine the speed of response to the previously identified&#13;
exogenous factors: that is, if there was a delay in the reaction of&#13;
the firm, and if so, why.&#13;
(4)      Adjustments in the operations of the firm:  What were the major forms&#13;
of adjustment to the shocks? Changes in production strategy,&#13;
marketing and prices, labor practices and/or finaLncial adjustments?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 212 -&#13;
(5)      Diversification of activities:  Because many' firms became involved in&#13;
new activities as a result of the reforms, this section determined&#13;
whether this was a major form of adjustment, and if so, why firms&#13;
reacted as they did.&#13;
(6)      Market characteristics and price decisiOns:  Here we wanted to&#13;
determine how much the reforms changed the structure of the market in&#13;
which the firm operated and whether this affected pricing decisions.&#13;
Below we include the questionnaire used by Corbo and Sanchez. With&#13;
minor changes (referring mostly to dates), this i.s the questionnaire that was&#13;
used in Argentina and Uruguay.&#13;

            Scrambling for survival : how firms
            adjusted to the recent reforms in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The authors who prepared this report
            carried out interviews with managers in manufacturing and
            agricultural exporting firms that elicited reactions about
            the favorable and unfavorable shocks caused by the reforms,
            the credibility and consistency of the reform packages, and
            the major adjustments in the firms' operations. The
            findings show that firms benefit from the removal of price
            controls, restrictive labor laws, and laws restricting the
            purchase of foreign know-how. But they were hurt by the
            pronounced real exchange rate appreciation and high real
            interest rates for peso borrowing toward the end of the
            reforms. In Argentina and Uruguay policy reversals often
            delayed adjustments in the operation of firms. Nonetheless,
            almost all managers reported that the reforms forced them to
            increase their operating efficiency because of greater
            import competition. In Chile, where liberalization was more
            widespread and where there was less doubt about
            reversibility, adjustments were the greatest. Productivity
            increases there were mostly achieved by reducing product
            variety and dismissing labor. In Uruguay, greater investment
            played a major role. In Argentina, mergers and changes in
            activity from production toward importing or from
            wholesaling toward retailing were often important.
