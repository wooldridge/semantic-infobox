1. ENERGY SECTOR AND THE MACROECONOMIC&#13;
CONTEXT&#13;
A.   MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT&#13;
1.1   Kenya's 25 million people had a per capita income of US$260 in 1994 (at current prices&#13;
and exchange rate). Kenya's economy depends on agriculture, which employs 70 percent of the&#13;
labor force and contributes more than one quarter of GDP. Coffee and tea are the main&#13;
agricultural products and account for almost one half of merchandise exports. The service sector,&#13;
including tourism (a leading foreign exchange earner), accounts for half of GDP and is an&#13;
important source of employment. The manufacturing sector is relatively developed and&#13;
diversified, and contributes about 13 percent of GDP.&#13;
1.2   Recent Economic Developments. The period 1990-1993 was marked by a sharp decline&#13;
in all the major macroeconomic performance indicators. Agricultural production was adversely&#13;
affected by unfavorable weather conditions. External imbalances worsened as a consequence of&#13;
the Gulf crisis during 1990-1991, a general deterioration in terms of trade, and the decision of&#13;
multilateral and bilateral donors, in November 1991, to withhold aid to Kenya because of&#13;
concerns about poor macroeconomic performance, governance and multiparty democracy.&#13;
1.3   Since the middle of 1993, the Government's sustained effort to tighten fiscal and&#13;
monetary policy has been effective in stabilizing the economy and contributing to the revival of&#13;
economic growth. GDP grew by 3 percent in 1994 and by 5 percent in 1995. The fiscal deficit&#13;
(exclusive of grants) has sharply reduced to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1995 and annual inflation&#13;
declined from a peak of 62 percent in January 1994 to 6.9 percent in December 1995. With&#13;
respect to structural reforms, the Government has eliminated foreign exchange controls and most&#13;
controls on exports and imports. The liberalization of the maize market in December 1993 and&#13;
the petroleum sub-sector in October 1994 abolished all price controls. Since 1992, the&#13;
Government has also been implementing a major civil service reform program that has trimmed&#13;
the sector by over 40,000 since July 1993. However, progress on parastatal reform has been slow&#13;
until recently.&#13;
1.4   The Government has outlined its reform program over the period 1996-1998 in a Policy&#13;
Framework Paper, which was distributed to the Board on February 23, 1996. This document&#13;
highlights poverty reduction as the principal objective. The reform program is being&#13;
supplemented by a new one-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) arrangement&#13;
with the IMF and an IDA Structural Adjustment Credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1.5   As noted in the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (discussed by the Board on January&#13;
30, 1996), an acceleration of economic growth is needed for poverty reduction in Kenya. Thus,&#13;
the key development challenge facing the Government over the next few years would be to create&#13;
the conditions for rapid and sustained growth which would reduce unemployment and poverty&#13;
significantly. Given its relatively strong human resource endowment, Kenya has good prospects&#13;
for export-led economic growth in excess of 5 percent per year, over the medium term, and even&#13;
higher growth rates could be achieved in the longer term. However, in order to achieve these&#13;
growth rates, which require rapid growth in manufactured exports, investment in basic&#13;
infrastructure, including energy, must increase.&#13;
B.   THE ENERGY SECTOR AND THE ECONOMY&#13;
1.6   The energy sector plays a critical role in the development of the economy. Adequate and&#13;
reliable supplies of power and energy are indispensable for economic growth, which is central for&#13;
poverty reduction - current shortage of power supplies is seriously affecting economic activity.&#13;
The energy sector also contributes significantly to the financing of public expenditures through&#13;
petroleum and income taxes. On the other hand, crude oil and petroleum products imports have a&#13;
significant impact on the balance of payment account and the sector draws on foreign export&#13;
earnings to service its external debt.&#13;
1.7   Because of the long time it has taken to reach agreemnet between the Government and the&#13;
donors on sector policies, investment in new power generation capacity has been delayed. As a&#13;
result, the power system is not adequate to meet demand. Peak load shedding has become&#13;
unavoidable and has increased from about 40 MW (6 percent of peak) in FY93/94 to about 75&#13;
MW (10 percent of peak) in FY94/95. During FY94/95 the Kenya Power and Lighting&#13;
Company Limited (KPLC) implemented a daily load shedding program, which curtailed supplies&#13;
during the morning and evening peak hours. Although many industries shifted loads to off-peak&#13;
periods in consultation with KPLC, and were thus able to reduce the economic impact of the&#13;
rationing, continuous processing industries had limited possibilities to shift their consumption&#13;
and therefore suffered losses in output. Although exact data on the quantity of unserved energy&#13;
demand is not available, the comparison of the forecast and actual sales for FY94/95 indicate a&#13;
figure of about 190 GWh. Assuming conservatively that the cost of unserved energy demand is&#13;
US$0.25 per kWh, which is comparable to the cost of running a private diesel generator, the cost&#13;
of energy shortages could be estimated at about US$50 million in FY1995. The rehabilitation of&#13;
existing plant is providing some relief in 1996, but, as the earliest possible date for&#13;
commissioning new generating capacity is FY1997/98, the gap between demand and supply&#13;
would grow wider, resulting in increased private sector costs and disincentives for new&#13;
investment.&#13;
1.8  In terms of contribution to the exchequer, the sector contributes revenues in the form of&#13;
taxes from the importation and sale of petroleum products, and corporate taxes and dividends. In&#13;
FY94/95, the sector generated about KSh 16,831 million (US$ 300 million) in fiscal revenue,&#13;
which was about 13 percent of total central Government revenue. About 80 percent of this was&#13;
from petroleum taxes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
1.9   On the expenditure side, the net petroleum import bill in 1995 was about US$270 million.&#13;
This means that Kenya used about 20 percent of its merchandise export earnings to pay for&#13;
petroleum - mostly crude oil imports. In addition, because of its high degree of monopoly&#13;
power, the refinery is able to pass on the costs of inefficient operations to the consumers. This&#13;
cost is estimated at about US$22 million per annum in the form of high prices for petroleum&#13;
products. Deregulation of the petroleum sub-sector, which is partially supported by the proposed&#13;
project would benefit consumers through efficient market-determined prices.&#13;
1.10  Because of Government policy of low tariffs until recently, the power sub-sector has&#13;
depended on Government support for financing some of its investment programns. With the tariff&#13;
reforms and other efficiency improvements initiated in the course of the preparation of the&#13;
project, the power sub-sector's financial performance would improve significantly, thereby&#13;
eliminating the requirement for future Government expenditure support.&#13;
C.   ENERGY RESOURCES&#13;
1.11  Kenya's known energy resources include hydro and geothermal power, biomass, wind&#13;
and solar energy. Exploration is in progress for hydrocarbons, but to date no significant reserves&#13;
have been discovered.&#13;
1.12 Hydropower. The hydroelectric potential that would be economic to develop for the grid&#13;
including installed capacity, exceeds 1,400 MW, with an annual average generation potential of&#13;
about 6,000 GWh. Tana and Turkwell Rivers have the largest potential. Hydro potential also&#13;
exist on other rivers, including the Ewaso Ngiro, Sondu, Nzoia, Nyando, Arror, and Athi. The&#13;
Sondu basin has been the subject of two studies towards the multipurpose development of the&#13;
basin's hydropower and irrigation potential. Consultants' reports have indicated that the&#13;
development of the Miriu Falls site on the Sondu River for power generation would be&#13;
economic. A feasibility study and economic evaluation was prepared under the Geothermal&#13;
Development and Pre-Investment Project (Cr. 1973-KE).&#13;
1.13  Geothermal Power. Potential geothermal sites are located in the Rift Valley which runs&#13;
from the border with Tanzania in the south to Ethiopia in the north. There are three major areas&#13;
of geothermal activity: Olkaria, Eburru, and Lake Bogoria, with possible reserves measured in&#13;
thousands of megawatts of electric generation capacity. The Olkaria field near Lake Naivasha,&#13;
about 100 km west of Nairobi, contains proven reserves of 350 MW, which are the basis for&#13;
power generation at the existing Olkaria Power Plant, and probable reserves of 600 MW at&#13;
exploration sites. The Eburru prospect, 30 km north of Olkaria, contains probable reserves in the&#13;
order of 100 MW. Several thermal manifestations in the Rift Valley between Eburru and the&#13;
northern border of Kenya indicate the existence of extensive, but as yet unquantified additional&#13;
energy resources. The Geothermal Development and Pre-Investment Project (Cr. 1973-KE)&#13;
assisted in drilling of about 30 production wells to deliver steam to the Olkaria I and II Power&#13;
Plants.&#13;
1.14  Biomass Resources. Kenya has large and diverse forest resources, though there is&#13;
pressure on forests around major population centers. The main biomass energy is woodfuel --&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
firewood and charcoal -- which is the major source of energy in Kenya, accounting for about 70-&#13;
75 percent of total energy use. Firewood is consumed by rural households and industries,&#13;
particularly for tea drying, while charcoal provides cooking energy for many urban households&#13;
and small commercial establishments. The only non-woody biomass resource which is being&#13;
utilized on a proven commercial scale is sugar cane bagasse. The Kenya sugar industry produces&#13;
about 35,000 tons of bagasse annually which, supplemented by fuelwood or fuel oil, is used to&#13;
raise steam for producing sugar cane and generating about 25 GWh of electricity from turbines&#13;
installed at individual sugar mills. The efficiency of power production from bagasse is low and&#13;
could be increased with the introduction of pre-drying, palletizing and other measures, which&#13;
could create surpluses to produce power for additional uses such as pumping water for irrigation&#13;
or for sale to a power company. The project would provide financing for a Renewable/Household&#13;
Energy Survey to provide the analytical basis for formulating a sustainable renewable/household&#13;
energy strategy. Further, a rural electrification master plan is currently being carried out to&#13;
explore alternative strategies for meeting rural power needs.&#13;
1.15  Solar and Wind. Kenya has a large potential of solar and wind energy, which have&#13;
economic potential for meeting energy requirements particularly for rural communities because&#13;
of the high cost of traditional network electrification. Indeed, Kenya has utilized its solar energy&#13;
potential more successfully than most African countries. According to an ESMAP study, at&#13;
least 20,000 photovoltaic units (PV) have been sold by the private sector since 1987. The&#13;
systems have been sold mainly to rural middle class households, which are well integrated into&#13;
the cash economy, but live far away from KPLC's power lines.' A unique feature is also the&#13;
predominant role played by the country's private sector. There are currently eight Nairobi-based&#13;
companies who supply the PV market, each with scores of agents in rural areas, to market,&#13;
install, and maintain the systems. To promote the use of PV technology, the Government has&#13;
over the past couple of years reduced the level of import tariffs and value-added tax on most PV&#13;
equipment. The proposed project would further assist the Government to maintain a competitive&#13;
tariff and tax policy for renewable energy equipment, and to establish guidelines for equipment&#13;
quality. These policy actions are supplemented by an ESMAP-financed micro-solar project,&#13;
initiated in 1995. The objective of the project is to overcome hurdles to wider adoptation of solar&#13;
energy technology: it would investigate innovative financing options for lower income&#13;
households, disseminate small solar powered lanterns on a commercial basis in rural villages and&#13;
evaluate technical product performance and customer satisfaction. In addition, the Arid Lands&#13;
Development Project, approved in November 1995 (Cr. No. 27970) would support renewable&#13;
energy. For example, if a community microproject on water would use a solar or a wind-driven&#13;
pump the project would finance it. To promote renewable energy technologies, the district&#13;
mobile extension teams would sensitize communities and other development actors on the&#13;
potential of renewable sources of energy and train community personnel in maintenance of the&#13;
facilities.&#13;
1.16  Wind energy is used on a limited scale, mainly for irrigation: currently some 200 water&#13;
pumps are in operation, many of them manufactured locally. In addition, KPLC operates a 200&#13;

kW wind turbine which, in 1995, provided 1.1 GWh to the grid, and a 350 kW hybrid&#13;
wind/diesel system to serve the electricity needs of the surrounding community.&#13;
1.17  Hydrocarbons. No commercial petroleum resource has yet been discovered. Based on&#13;
evidence available from drilling by privately owned oil companies in Kenya and in neighboring&#13;
countries, Kenya's petroleum prospects are rated modest, but in view of the sparse data coverage&#13;
its petroleum prospects remain to be fully evaluated. The most attractive areas at present are the&#13;
Rift-related structural basins in the interior. Also of interest is the coastal margin basin where the&#13;
majority of Kenya's exploration to date has taken place. The Bank has supported Kenya in&#13;
promoting petroleum exploration by private companies, most recently through the Petroleum&#13;
Exploration Technical Assistance Credit 1 675-KE.&#13;

2. ENERGY SECTOR ORGANIZATION&#13;
A.   POLICY INSTITUTIONS&#13;
2.1   The Ministry of Energy (MOE) is responsible for energy policy formulation and&#13;
oversight of the operations of the organizations in the power and petroleum sub-sectors.&#13;
MOE is also concerned with the development of power, petroleum exploration and&#13;
supply, and the development of biomass and other new and renewable energy resources.&#13;
Until recently the Ministry of Finance (MOF), in consultation with MOE, established&#13;
prices and tax rates for both power and petroleum products. Since October 1994,&#13;
petroleum products retail prices have been market-determined.&#13;
B.   ELECTRICITY SUB-SECTOR&#13;
2.2   Sub-sector Institutions. Three limited liability companies, and two regional&#13;
development authorities are currently operating in the power sub-sector: the Kenya Power&#13;
Company (KPC), the Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC), the Tana River&#13;
Development Company (TRDC), the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority&#13;
(TARDA) and the Kerio Valley Development Authority (KVDA). The salient features of&#13;
these institutions are:&#13;
(a)   KPLC: KPLC was established in 1983, to become the successor of the East&#13;
Africa Power and Lighting Company (EAPLC), a private company founded in&#13;
1922. KPLC is owned by the GoK (51.49%), Kenya residents (41.13%) and&#13;
nonresidents (7.38%). It is the only institution licensed to distribute electricity,&#13;
and therefore, owns all the distribution facilities. It also owns some small&#13;
hydroelectric plants, some thermal plants and transmission lines. It operates the&#13;
generation and transmission system and manages both KPC and TRDC, as well as&#13;
the generation facilities of TARDA and KVDA. It is responsible for the&#13;
preparation of the sub-sector's expansion programs and is the GoK's executing&#13;
agency for designing, constructing and operating rural electrification schemes.&#13;
(b)   KPC: KPC was created in 1954, to import electricity from Uganda for sale by the&#13;
EAPLC. KPC is wholly owned by the GoK, has no staff of its own and is&#13;
managed by KPLC under a management contract. It owns the Olkaria geothermal&#13;
power station, two small hydro plants (Tana and Wanji, 14 and 7 MW,&#13;
respectively), the interconnection line with Uganda and other transmission lines.&#13;
The power generated from KPC's plants and imported power from Uganda is sold&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
to KPLC at cost (includes debt service, operation, maintenance and development&#13;
surcharge to meet the local contribution for new investment).&#13;
(c)   TRDC: TRDC was created in 1964 as a separate company to develop the&#13;
hydroelectric potential of the Tana River. TRDC is wholly Government owned&#13;
and is also managed by KPLC. The company owns three power stations, Gitaru&#13;
(145 MW), Kamburu (92 MW) and Kindaruma (44 MW).&#13;
(d)   TARDA: This is a development authority fully owned by GoK. It was created in&#13;
1974 for the integral development of several basins in the Tana river including&#13;
their hydroelectric, irrigation, fisheries and associated tourism potential. It owns&#13;
the Masinga (40 MW) and Kiambere (144 MW) power stations and their&#13;
associated transmission lines. KPLC operates and maintains the power facilities&#13;
and buys power in bulk from TARDA. Under the financing of Kiambere, KPLC&#13;
is obligated to cover the cost of debt service on higher terms than those provided&#13;
to the Government by lenders. The difference was originally intended to provide&#13;
TARDA with financing for its non-power activities. In 1988 the GoK instructed&#13;
KPLC to direct its payments to the Treasury and to base them on the terms at&#13;
which the loans had been provided to the GoK. To compensate TARDA for the&#13;
loss of revenue, since 1994 the Treasury and KPLC have provided support to&#13;
TARDA.&#13;
(e)   KVDA: This is also a development authority fully owned by GoK. It was created&#13;
in 1979 with similar objectives to TARDA. It implemented the Turkwell Hydro&#13;
Plant (106 MW), completed in 1991 (para 3.18(c)).&#13;
2.3   The complexity of the power sub-sector organization, especially the overlapping&#13;
financial functions among the entities, has given rise to disputes on issues of assets&#13;
ownership and responsibility for debt service. The GoK has therefore decided to&#13;
restructure the sub-sector with a view to creating commercial-type relationships among&#13;
the companies. The restructuring has separated management of generation assets from&#13;
that of transmission and distribution assets. The Turkwell Hydropower Plant will be&#13;
transferred to the generation company at a cost reflecting replacement cost. The action&#13;
plan for reorganization of the power sub-sector which has been agreed with the&#13;
Government is shown in Annex 2.1.&#13;
2.4   As of May 1993, KPLC, the only institution with staff, was over-staffed. It had&#13;
10,616 employees, serving 300,000 customers giving a customer/employee ratio of 28:1.&#13;
In early 1994, agreement was reached between KPLC and the Bank for KPLC to improve&#13;
its customer/employee ratio to at least 45:1 by the end of 1995. By December 1994 the&#13;
customer/employee ratio had increased to 35.4:1 and currently stands at 50:1. Since&#13;
KPLC was understaffed at the professional level and over-staffed at other levels, these&#13;
improvements have been achieved through contracting out non-core services and staff&#13;
reductions,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
2.5   Applicable Legislation and its Impact on the Sub-Sector: The limited liability&#13;
companies are governed by the Companies Act, and as such should be able to operate as&#13;
commercial concerns. As part of the sector reforms, KPLC and KPC were recently&#13;
exempted from the provisions of the State Corporations Act. The Act severely limits the&#13;
entities' management and operational autonomy including that of the development&#13;
authorities. Apart from the State Corporation Act, the other legislation affecting the&#13;
generation, transmission and distribution of power consists of the Electric Power Act, the&#13;
Geothermal Resources Act, and other Acts that deal with foreign investment and with&#13;
land use. There is currently no environmental legislation for the sub-sector. The effects&#13;
of the various laws on the sub-sector are as follows:&#13;
(a)   The State Corporations Act poses restrictions on the companies and&#13;
development authorities, as it gives the President and the responsible Minister&#13;
wide discretionary powers over them. For example, the President may appoint&#13;
and remove board members, and he may issue directives which must be&#13;
implemented by the Board.&#13;
(b)   The Electric Power Act. The Act provides the Minister with broad powers. In&#13;
addition to formulating sub-sector policy, he has control over electricity tariffs.&#13;
The Minister also is the dispenser of the licenses needed to participate in any of&#13;
the sub-sector's activities. He may also revoke or modify the terms of a license&#13;
during its life. Such wide ranging powers are not conducive to the efficient&#13;
operation of the sub-sector and are incompatible with today's accepted industry&#13;
and business practices which are based on a clear separation of the ownership,&#13;
regulation and operation of the sub-sector.&#13;
(c)   The Geothermal Resources Act is meant to regulate the use of Kenya's&#13;
geothermal resources. It establishes that the resources belong to the State and&#13;
again confers power to the Minister of Energy. He issues licenses for exploration&#13;
and exploitation and can impose levies, rentals and royalties for use of the&#13;
resources.&#13;
2.6   The sub-sector has been regulated by the Minister of Energy. The creation of an&#13;
independent and credible regulatory mechanism is clearly important for the long-term&#13;
sustainability of private sector participation in the sub-sector. The Government has&#13;
prepared an action plan for reform of the legal and regulatory framework for the power&#13;
sub-sector including specific proposals for establishment of an autonomous Electricity&#13;
Regulatory Board (ERB). The draft enabling legislation has been prepared with PPF&#13;
financing and would be presented to the Borrower's legislature prior to Credit&#13;
effectiveness (para .8.2 (i)). Further, the Government has stated in its Letter of Sector&#13;
Policy that the power sub-sector will now be required to operate on a commercial basis&#13;
without burdening the Government budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
C.   PETROLEUM SUB-SECTOR&#13;
2.7   Sub-sector Institutions. Eight private companies, two parastatals and one semi&#13;
private company operate in the petroleum sub-sector. The supply and distribution of&#13;
petroleum products is in the hands of subsidiaries of six multinational oil companies&#13;
(AGIP, BP, CALTEX, ESSO, SHELL, TOTAL), and two other private companies&#13;
(KOBIL and KENOL). The state-owned National Oil Corporation of Kenya (NOCK)&#13;
oversees exploration activities and procures crude oil and petroleum products in&#13;
competition with the other oil companies. The Kenya Petroleum Refenery Ltd. (KPRL)&#13;
at Mombasa, is jointly owned by four oil companies (Shell, BP, Esso and Caltex - 50%)&#13;
and the Government (50%). The Kenya Pipeline Company (KPL) operates the petroleum&#13;
products pipeline which runs from Mombasa to Nairobi and farther to Nakuru, Eldoret&#13;
and Kisumu in western Kenya.&#13;
2.8   The Government deregulated the procurement and importation of crude oil and&#13;
finished products, and retail prices in October 1994. NOCK's right to supply at least&#13;
30% of the distributors' crude oil requirements was rescinded and the distributors are no&#13;
longer obliged to meet their requirements through KPRL (para. 3.22). However, the&#13;
petroleum sub-sector could not be fully deregulated because of the market's dependence&#13;
on KPRL for LPG (a by-product in the refining process) and the absence of infrastructure&#13;
for its importation. Therefore, the Government: (i) required oil companies to import and&#13;
process through the refinery at least 1.6 million tons of crude annually, which is the&#13;
volume required to meet the market's current demand for LPG; and (ii) protected the&#13;
refinery's operations, initially for two years through a tax on selected imported products.&#13;

3. ENERGY MARKETS, PRICING AND KEY ISSUES&#13;
A.    THE ENERGY MARKETS - ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND SUPPLY&#13;
3.1    Kenya's total energy consumption amounted to about 12.5 million tons of oil&#13;
equivalent (toe) in 1994. This translates to 0.48 toe per capita, which is low by world&#13;
standards but the highest in the Eastern Africa Region'. Fuelwood and charcoal met 70-&#13;
75 percent of total energy consumption. Modem energy products - electricity and&#13;
petroleum products - met the remainder. Kenya's modem energy consumption (0.10 toe&#13;
per capita) is below other developing countries, though it is higher than the average 0.07&#13;
toe for sub-Saharan Africa2. Annex 3.1 shows the national energy balance.&#13;
Electricity&#13;
3.2   Consumption. The growth rate in KPLC's electricity sales has declined during&#13;
the past couple of years, owing to a combination of a slowdown in economic growth, and&#13;
a supply shortage. While KPLC's sales increased by more than 5 percent annually during&#13;
1987 and 1991, the average annual increase has been around 4 percent since 1991. Total&#13;
sales in the interconnected system were 3,402 GWh in FY96 of which 45% was to large&#13;
industrial and service establishments. Larger industrial and service sector have also been&#13;
the consumer category with the most rapidly increasing demand. The total number of&#13;
consumers, including rural electrification, is about 406,000 of which 307,000 (76%) are&#13;
residential. It is estimated that only 7 to 8 percent of the total population has access to&#13;
electricity. Table 3.1 and Annex 3.2 show electricity sales by consumer category in&#13;
FY96.&#13;
3.3   The growth in system peak demand has also slowed down significantly over the&#13;
past few years, and was 648 MW in the 1995/1996 fiscal year. Overall, the average&#13;
annual increase has been below 4 percent since 1990, compared to 6.5 percent during the&#13;
second half of the 1980s.&#13;
Total per capita energy consumption in Uganda and Ethiopia is about 0.3 toe and in Tanzania about&#13;
0.45 toe.&#13;
2  Modem per capita energy consumption in 1991 was about 0.4 toe in Thailand; about 0.3 toe in the&#13;
Philippines, India and Indonesia, while it was about 2.1 toe in Korea.&#13;

3.5    Generation Facilities. Hydro power stations dominate (79%) the interconnected&#13;
system of 776 MW of available generating capacity, while geothermal and oil thermal&#13;
stations provide the balance. In addition, Kenya has an import agreement with the&#13;
Uganda Electricity Board (UEB) for 30 MW of firm power up to the year 2005.&#13;
However, because UEB has had little capacity to spare, it has usually been able to export&#13;
only during off-peak hours. During 1990-1995, UEB provided only 17 MW of off-peak&#13;
power. Table 3.2 shows the available generating capacity and annual generation in FY96.&#13;

3.6    The two most important power stations are the Gitaru and Kiambere hydroelectric&#13;
stations, which together produced almost 80 percent of total energy in the interconnected&#13;
system in 1995/1996. The Olkaria I geothermal station and the liquid fuel generators&#13;
(diesels, steam units and gas turbines) provided less than 10 percent each.&#13;
3.7    Transmission and Distribution Facilities. The transmission facilities are the&#13;
following: 980 km of 220 kV lines; 450 km of 66 kV; 120 km of 40 kV; 3,450 km of 33&#13;
kV; and 8,300 km of 11 kV circuits. The 220 kV network is about 10 years old and&#13;
consists of four line segments. All 220 and 132 kV lines have single pole reclosing. As a&#13;
result of only one 220 kV line connecting Mombasa to the major hydrostations and&#13;
because the thermal capacity in the Mombasa area is insufficient to meet the demand, the&#13;
quality of service suffers when the line fails. There is also insufficient voltage support in&#13;
Mombasa (supply voltage is too low part of the time, and too high at other times). To&#13;
improve supply in Mombasa, the project includes installation of transformers,&#13;
construction of lines and substation. Distribution voltage is typically 33 and 11 kV.&#13;
Secondary distribution voltage is 415 volts for three phase supply and 240 volts for single&#13;
phase service.&#13;
3.8    System Operations. System operations have been constrained over the last few&#13;
years due to insufficient reserve margin, and were further affected by the damage suffered&#13;
by one of Gitaru's generating units which took about a year to repair and was returned to&#13;
service in March 1996. As no new capacity has been added to the system since FY&#13;
1990/1991, reserve margins have continuously decreased, and KPLC has been forced to&#13;
resort to periodic load shedding (para 1.7). The output from the thermal plants have&#13;
increased in the past couple of years as a result of: (i) a rehabilitation program that has&#13;
managed to bring up the steam, gas turbine and diesel units close to their rated capacities;&#13;
and (ii) the connection, in 1995, of drilled make-up wells to recover the original output of&#13;
the Olkaria I Geothermal Power Plant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
3.9    KPLC has been relatively successful in managing system losses -- about 16&#13;
percent of net generation -- when compared to neighboring countries (international&#13;
standard is 10 %). However, they are quite high in some parts of the transmission and&#13;
distribution system, especially in the Coastal area, where KPLC rely on long 33 kV&#13;
feeders to supply load concentrations on the Mombasa Island. As loss levels increase&#13;
with load growth, targeted loss reduction measures are required to prevent unacceptable&#13;
growth. The proposed project includes a four-year line loss reduction program&#13;
comprising upgrading and installation of new feeders, replacement of capacitors, low&#13;
voltage system reinforcements and construction of new substations (para. 4.5 (c (ii)).&#13;
3.10   Demand and Supply Balances. The sales forecast predicts electricity&#13;
consumption to increase on average by 5.6 percent per year over the next ten years to&#13;
5,785 GWh in 2006. Charts 3.2 and 3.3 below depict the operation of the interconnected&#13;
system with and without the proposed project. Chart 3.2 shows the annual balance&#13;
between peak demand and available generating capacity and indicates that the system's&#13;
reserve margin presently is negligible resulting in peak load shedding. The situation&#13;
worsened during 1996 as several of the old Kipevu thermal units were derated due to&#13;
breakdown. With the investments under the proposed project, the capacity balance would&#13;
remain comfortably positive from the year 2000 through 2004. Thereafter, new capacity&#13;
needs to be installed to meet the growing demand. The chart also shows that without the&#13;
project, the capacity of the existing system would decline slightly with the retirement of&#13;
the old steam and gas turbine units (Annex 7.3 provides details).&#13;

3.11   Chart 3.3 below shows the annual balance between electric energy demand and&#13;

energy would continue until Kipevu II and Olkaria III are commissioned in FY2000.&#13;
Then, with the other investments under the proposed project - and under average&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

the demand again starts pressing close on supply.&#13;

3.12  Domestic petroleum products consumption has grown relatively slowly in the past&#13;
years (I% per year on average), and was 2 million tons in 1995 (Chart 3.4). The transport&#13;
sector accounts for about 67 percent of total consumption; government establishrnents for&#13;
25 percent; and non-governmental industries, the service sector, agriculture and&#13;
households for the balance of 8 percent. Given strong economic growth of at least 5&#13;
percent per year, future consumption growth levels are expected to be higher than those&#13;
experienced in the recent past. In addition, LPG consumption is expected to increase&#13;
once the supply constraints are removed.&#13;
3.13  Since Kenya does not have its own oil resources, all petroleum requirements are&#13;
imported. Crude oil is refined at the Mombasa refinery, but due to the simple&#13;
configuration of the refinery, it is uneconomic to process sufficient crude oil to match the&#13;
domestic demand and, therefore, refined products are imported to meet the supply&#13;
shortfall. Kenya imported about 2 million tons of crude oil and 500,000 tons of refined&#13;
products in 1995.&#13;
3.14 Refined products are transported via a pipeline from the Mombasa Refinery to&#13;
Nairobi, and after the recent extension of the pipeline, from Nairobi farther to the towns&#13;
of Kisumu and Eldoret in western Kenya. The pipeline also serves as a transport media&#13;
for about half of the petroleum products requirements of Uganda (the other half is&#13;
transported via Tanzania).&#13;

B.    ENERGY PRICING&#13;
3.15  Electricity Tariffs. Kenya has had a history of low electricity tariffs. The low&#13;
prices led to the deterioration of the power sub-sector's financial viability (paras. 5.8 -&#13;
5.12). In 1994, however, Kenya started moving towards economic pricing. Under the&#13;
program of tariff adjustments agreed with IDA, the first installment raised the average&#13;
tariff by about 60% in March 1994. The resulting average tariff was about 55% of&#13;
LRMC. The second installment, effected in October 1996, increased the average&#13;
electricity tariff to about 73 percent of LRMC. An update of the November 1993 Tariff&#13;
Study to be completed by November 1997, would provide the basis for the Govemrment&#13;
to agree with IDA on the magnitude and timing of additional adjustments to cover full&#13;
LRMC. The 1994 increases improved KPLC's financial position, and future increases&#13;
would help it to finance a reasonable share of the costs of its investment program and&#13;
contribute to more efficient use of electricity. As the sub-sector is moving towards&#13;
commercialization and independent power producers (IPPs), bulk supply tariffs for&#13;
purchases from IPPs would be based on the ICB process while the tariffs to final&#13;
consumers would be decided by an autonomous ERB (para. 2.6) on the basis of LRMC&#13;
principles and the financial needs of the subsector.&#13;
3.16 Petroleum Products Prices. On October 27, 1994, the GoK deregulated&#13;
petroleum products pricing in line with the agreement reached with the Bank in the&#13;
Policy Framework Paper for 1994-1996. Taxes account for between 0 percent (jet fuel)&#13;
and 53 percent (regular gasoline) of retail prices.&#13;
3.17 Comparative Household Energy Costs. Table 3.5 below shows that firewood&#13;
and charcoal are the lowest cost cooking fuels on an equivalent energy basis. Electricity&#13;
is substantially more expensive and consequently it is not commonly used for cooking.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
In an effort to promote switching from kerosene and charcoal to LPG, the Government is&#13;
considering standardizing LPG equipment to increase market competition and lower&#13;
prices. The proposed project would finance a study to recommend uniform standards for&#13;
LPG cylinders, valves and pressure regulators including the associated testing,&#13;
monitoring and regulatory arrangements (para. 4.5 (B)). Additionally, the liberalization&#13;
of petroleum prices should increase the availability of fuels even in the more remote&#13;
areas. Availability would also improve upon completion of the infrastructure to allow&#13;
increased production and/or importation of LPG. The household/rural energy studies&#13;
under the project would assess taxation policies to promote transition to efficient modem&#13;
fuels (para. 4.5(B)).&#13;

C.     KEY ISSUES IN THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
3.18 The principal issues in the energy sector are: (i) Government involvement in all&#13;
aspects of energy sector operations (para. 2.5); (ii) low electricity prices in relation to the&#13;
power sub-sector's financial requirements and to the economic cost of supply (para.&#13;
3.15); (iii) complex power sub-sector organizational structure (para. 2.3); (iv) until&#13;
recently, GoK control of petroleum products pricing, marketing and procurement&#13;
resulting in economic distortions; (v) low demand and supply-side energy efficiency; and&#13;
(vi) potentially negative environmental effects of energy projects. Because of the long&#13;
time it has taken the GoK and the Bank to reach agreement on sector reform policies, it&#13;
has proved difficult for the GoK to mobilize resources for the required investmnents, thus&#13;
resulting in the current electricity supply shortages.&#13;
(a)    Government Involvement. The GoK has played a dominant role in the sector&#13;
through ownership of facilities and a significant involvement in strategic and&#13;
operations management. It is the main owner of power generation facilities,&#13;
owner of the oil pipeline and petroleum storage facilities, and has a 50 percent&#13;
stake in the KPRL. In addition, the GoK takes an active management role in the&#13;
key areas of setting and approving electricity prices, approving investment&#13;
programs, and appointing the Boards of the energy enterprises. Prior to the&#13;
exemption of KPLC and KPC from the State Corporations Act, the GoK also&#13;
provided the ceilings on staff remuneration and benefit levels under the general&#13;
categorization of parastatals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
(b)   Electricity Pricing. For many years, the average electricity tariff&#13;
remained substantially below the economic and financial cost of supply&#13;
(para. 3.15). As a result, the sub-sector experienced financial difficulties&#13;
which impacted on its ability to service external debt obligations, which&#13;
the Government had to meet under guarantee agreements with lenders.&#13;
However, following recent tariff increases, the industry has reimbursed the&#13;
GoK. Low prices have also promoted inefficient use of electricity.&#13;
(c)   Complex Organization of the Electricity Sub-Sector. Power purchase&#13;
arrangements between the KPLC and the bulk supply companies (KPC,&#13;
TRDC, TARDA and KVDA) are complex. KPLC purchases power from&#13;
the bulk supply companies under various purchase and lease agreements.&#13;
A number of unusual practices are apparent in the execution of these&#13;
agreements. First, with respect to power purchases from TARDA, the&#13;
Government requires KPLC to remit payments to cover TARDA's debt&#13;
obligations to the Treasury, instead of making payments to TARDA as&#13;
envisioned under the original agreement. Since 1994, KPLC also pays&#13;
KSh 55 million annually directly to TARDA to cover expenditure on&#13;
catchment preservation, dam monitoring and security. In addition, the&#13;
GoK finances the cost of TARDA's other activities. Second, the&#13;
ownership of the Turkwell power plant implemented in 1991 (developed&#13;
by KVDA and operated by KPLC) is undefined. Nevertheless, KPLC has&#13;
since 1994 paid KVDA KSh 45 million annually to cover operating and&#13;
maintenance costs related to the Turkwell dam. In addition to the annual&#13;
payments, KPLC also pays the equivalent of US cents 3 per KWh for the&#13;
electricity dispatched from Turkwell and covers the operation and&#13;
maintenance costs of the power station.&#13;
(d)   Petroleum Sub-Sector Operations. With the deregulation of petroleum&#13;
products prices and importation in October 1994, the main outstanding&#13;
issue is the removal of the remaining impediments to full competition: (i)&#13;
the requirement for the market participants to process at least 1.6 million&#13;
tons of crude oil per annum so as to meet the current consumption of LPG;&#13;
and (ii) the import taxes on fuel products instituted to protect KPRL,&#13;
initially for two years up to October 1996. Based on estimates by the&#13;
present shareholders, the minimum level of protection that the refinery in&#13;
its present state would need to be competitive with direct product imports&#13;
is equivalent to about US$1.5 per barrel imported products. This&#13;
translates into an annual cost to the economy of about US$22-37 million.&#13;
These issues are being addressed under the Bank's macroeconomic&#13;
dialogue with the Government.&#13;
(e)   Delays in Implementing Sector Investment Programs. Investment,&#13;
both in new plants and in the rehabilitation of existing facilities to meet&#13;
the growing demand for energy has been inadequate. The main reasons&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
for inadequate investment have been lack of donor support due to slow&#13;
implementation of sector reforns and inadequate self-financing. As a&#13;
result, Kenya is now experiencing electricity shortages which are imposing&#13;
a substantial cost to the economy and restraining economic growth (para&#13;
1.7). If the required investments are not undertaken quickly, electricity&#13;
shortages would continue to increase with serious consequences to the&#13;
economy, especially if rainfall is below average and reduces the output&#13;
from the hydro plants. The sub-sector's aggregate investment&#13;
requirements are estimated to total almost US$1,000 million during FY96-&#13;
2001, the financing of which would be a heavy burden on the economy&#13;
unless the Government seeks new ways of mobilizing resources, for&#13;
instance from the private sector as well as substantially improving the&#13;
financial performance of the power companies. This in turn requires&#13;
increasing the operational efficiency of the companies and adoption of&#13;
sound pricing policies. The proposed project would finance about US$700&#13;
million (excluding interest during construction) for the next five years.&#13;
Additional resources would therefore need to be soon mobilized,&#13;
particularly for financing of transmission and distribution systems.&#13;
(f)   Demand and Supply-Side Energy Efficiency. Although some efforts&#13;
have been made to improve energy efficiency, inappropriate energy&#13;
pricing policies and lack of awareness of savings opportunities have&#13;
impeded progress in this area. On the supply side, KPLC has recently&#13;
carried out a loss reduction study, with the assistance of ESMAP, to&#13;
identify cost-effective means to reduce distribution losses in the major&#13;
load centers. On the demand side, the Kenya Industrial Energy&#13;
Management Programme -- initiated in 1985, and administered by the&#13;
Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) -- focuses on the provision of&#13;
information and energy audit services on a cost- sharing basis. Currently,&#13;
ESMAP is providing support to increase the program's commercialization&#13;
through greater cost-sharing by the benefiting industries, and to introduce&#13;
modem techniques and skills. The outlook for improved demand and&#13;
supply-side energy efficiency is more promising today because of the new&#13;
tariff policy, the power sub-sector reorganization, including greater&#13;
commercial orientation and private sector participation. The proposed&#13;
project would build on the past experiences and the new incentives and&#13;
finance activities to develop the human and institutional capabilities,&#13;
promote private sector participation and introduce energy efficient&#13;
technologies.&#13;
Agenda for Policy Reform&#13;
3.19 The dialogue between the Bank and the Government of Kenya on energy sector&#13;
reforms has been going on since the preparation of the Geothermal Development and Pre-&#13;
Investment Project in 1988. The Government fully recognizes the importance of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
issues discussed above on both sector and macroeconomic performance and has recently&#13;
committed itself to creating an efficient and viable energy sector.&#13;
3.20  The GoK's overall strategic objective is to create enabling conditions for an&#13;
efficient energy sector and eliminate electricity supply deficits. To accomplish this&#13;
objective, the strategy is detailed in Government's Letter of Sector Development Policy&#13;
(Annex 3.4). The strategy comprises: (i) macroeconomic measures to create an enabling&#13;
environment for attracting private sector investment and to improve incentives for&#13;
operational efficiency; (ii) reforms of the sector's institutional and legal environment; and&#13;
(iii) least-cost investments in power to eliminate supply deficits in the late 1990s and&#13;
early 2000s. Public sector investments are expected to be complemented by private&#13;
sector investment in at least two power plants in the next five years.&#13;
3.21  Macroeconomic. The macroeconomic measures relate primarily to the&#13;
adjustment of power tariffs and to the deregulation of the petroleum sub-sector. On&#13;
electricity prices, the objective is to reach economic levels so as to provide appropriate&#13;
consumer signals and to enable the sub-sector to become financially viable. The&#13;
Government agreed in the context of the 1994-1996 PFP, to raise the average tariff to 75&#13;
percent of the LRMC by 1996, in three installments starting in March 1994. In the first&#13;
installment, a nominal increase of about 60 percent in the average tariff raised it to about&#13;
55 percent of LRMC. The second installment, scheduled for March 1995 was postponed&#13;
since the average tariff had already reached the 65 percent of the LRMC target due to&#13;
appreciation of the KSh. The installment on October 1, 1996, raised the average tariff to&#13;
about 73 percent of LRMC. In addition, the Government has: (i) given KPLC the&#13;
autonomy to implement a fuel adjustment clause since March, 1994; (ii) agreed to allow&#13;
KPLC to automatically adjust tariffs to reflect changes in the cost of external debt service&#13;
arising from fluctuation in the exchange rate of Kenya shilling. Further adjustments&#13;
would be determined on the basis of an update of the Tariff Study to be completed by&#13;
November 1997 and recommendations, satisfactory to IDA, would be implemented&#13;
during FY1997/98. This issue will also be addressed under the Bank's macroeconomic&#13;
dialogue, as the agreement between the Government and IDA on an action plan for the&#13;
implementation of further tariff adjustments is a condition for the Structural Adjustment&#13;
Credit's second trance release.&#13;
3.22  With regard to the petroleum sub-sector, the GoK deregulated the importation,&#13;
marketing and pricing of petroleum products on October 27, 1994. The objective of the&#13;
deregulation was to create a competitive and efficient market for petroleum products by&#13;
removing controls on procurement, distribution and pricing of products. The following&#13;
measures have been implemented to date:&#13;
(i)    NOCK's right to import upto 30 percent of domestic product requirements&#13;
was rescinded;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
(ii)  temporary import tariff of KSh 0.50 per liter on all finished petroleum&#13;
products except kerosene, LPG and automotive diesel, to allow KPRL to&#13;
prepare for a competitive environment;&#13;
(iii)  liberalization of retail prices, although, under the Restrictive Trade&#13;
Practices and Monopolies Act Ch. 504, the MoF has powers to fix ceiling&#13;
prices in areas with inadequate competition;&#13;
(iv)   a monitoring cell was established in MOE to monitor petroleum products'&#13;
prices and maintenance of minimum operating stocks of 30 days&#13;
consumption of liquid products and 10 days for LPG by oil companies;&#13;
and&#13;
(v)   requirement that the oil companies refine at least 1.6 million tons of LPG&#13;
rich crude oil at KPRL to secure LPG supply until alternative supply&#13;
arrangements have been worked out.&#13;
3.23  The Government and other shareholders in the refinery are currently discussing&#13;
tbe options for the future of the refinery. These include: (i) extension of protection to&#13;
gin e KPRL more time to improve its competitiveness in an open environment, including&#13;
investment in improving LPG output; and (ii) closure of the refinery with the possibility&#13;
o-f converting it into a fuel import facility including importation of LPG. These issues are&#13;
beivig addressed under the Bank's macroeconomic dialogue with the Government.&#13;
3.24  Institutional and Legal Environment. This aspect of the strategy comprises&#13;
restructuring of the power sub-sector to create arm's length commercial-type&#13;
relationships between the companies and reforms of the legal and regulatory framework&#13;
o tlacilitate the restructuring of the sub-sector and encourage private sector participation.&#13;
A ti autonomous regulatory arrangement is particularly important to ensure that decisions&#13;
im' electricity pricing, and environmental issues among other things are taken in an&#13;
,o'bi(ctive manner.&#13;
'.X95  On power restructuring, the GoK commissioned a two phase Power Sector&#13;
P,estructuring Study to recommend an efficient industry structure and an implementation&#13;
anid financial restructuring plan. Based on the reports' recommendations, the&#13;
Go vernrnent agreed to restructure the sector entities into two separate companies, one for&#13;
generation and one for transmission and distribution, both to be managed on a&#13;
commercial basis under the auspices of performance contracts. In addition, new power&#13;
oplants would be offered to both the private and public sector generating companies to&#13;
construct, own, manage and operate. Further efficiency gains would be achieved from&#13;
st teamlining staffing to levels consistent with industry standards and from contracting out&#13;
ml.2iIlary and other services. Agreement has been reached with the Government on an&#13;
actiocn plan for restructuring the power sub-sector and implementation of the&#13;
r-estructuring has started.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
3.26 The Government has also commissioned a study of the legal and regulatory&#13;
framework for the energy sector. On the basis of the study's findings, agreement has&#13;
been reached with the Government on an action plan for implementation of the&#13;
recommended reforms (including a detailed proposalfor the establishment of an&#13;
autonomous regulatory arrangement for the power sub-sector). Submission to&#13;
Parliament of the required amendments to the Electric Power Act would be a condition&#13;
for Credit effectiveness (para. 8.2 (i)).&#13;
3.27  Investment. The third element of the strategy comprises investments in power&#13;
generation and associated transmission and distribution, designed to eliminate electricity&#13;
supply deficits in the late 1990s and early 2000s and to increase supply and demand-side&#13;
efficiency. Agreement was reached, during appraisal, on a five-year investment plan for&#13;
the power sub-sector. Further, during negotiations, agreement was reachedfor the&#13;
Government to review with IDA its power sub-sector five-year rolling investment plan by&#13;
March 31, of each year. GoK would not undertake any investments of more than US$10 &#13;
million (including IPPs), outside the agreed least-cost plan without consulting with IDA&#13;
(para 8.1 (i)). The investment program includes construction by KPC of three power&#13;
plants which are critical for meeting power demand in the late 1990s, addition of a 72.5&#13;
MW unit at an existing power station (Gitaru) and private sector construction and&#13;
operation of two other power plants (75 MW Kipevu II Diesel and 64 MW Olkaria III&#13;
Geothermal) which are required under the least-cost investment program, and which&#13;
would increase competition in the sector and improve operational efficiency.&#13;
D.   WORLD BANK GROUP INVOLVEMENT&#13;
3.28  IDA has provided seven loans and credits totaling about US$212.2 million for&#13;
financing power investments in Kenya between 1971-1988. The first two power projects&#13;
(Ln. 745-KE and Ln. 1147-KE) helped finance hydroelectric development on the Tana&#13;
River. The projects were designed to meet the demand for power in Nairobi and the&#13;
coastal area around Mombasa, where most of the industrial and commercial activities of&#13;
Kenya are concentrated. Five loans and credits were made for the development of&#13;
geothermal power in Kenya. The Olkaria Geothermal Engineering Loan (Ln S-12-KE of&#13;
1978) financed drilling of additional wells to gauge the productivity of the Olkaria steam&#13;
field and to ensure that there was sufficient steam for each generating unit proposed under&#13;
Phase II of the Olkaria Geothermal Development Project. The Olkaria Geothermal Power&#13;
Project (Ln. 1799-KE of 1980) aimed to provide a firm source of power and energy&#13;
within the country to meet the growth of demand expected from 1981 to 1985 and to&#13;
assist in reducing the country's heavy dependence on imported oil. The Olkaria&#13;
Geothermal Power Expansion Project (Ln. 2237-KE of 1983) was intended to meet the&#13;
growth in energy demand which was projected to exceed the available capacity at the&#13;
time. The Geothermal Exploration Project (Ln. 1486-KE of 1984) was to support&#13;
acceleration of the geothermal exploration and improve new reserves that could support&#13;
additional power generation during the 1990s. The main objective of the recently&#13;
completed Geothermal Development and Energy Pre-Investment Project (Cr. 1973-KE of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
1988) was to assist Kenya in preparing a least-cost power generation expansion plan,&#13;
largely through utilization of indigenous energy resources, and to develop options for&#13;
energy pricing policies. It also addressed selected aspects of rural electrification policy&#13;
and household fuel supply and distribution.&#13;
3.29  Three loans were made for reforestation (Loans 641-KE. 1132-KE/Credit 565-KE&#13;
and 2098-KE/Cr. 1213 -KE). The first loan was implemented satisfactorily, while the&#13;
second loan suffered from cost overruns and implementation problems. In the petroleum&#13;
sub-sector, the Bank financed the construction of the products pipeline from Mombasa to&#13;
Nairobi (Ln. 1 133-KE) between 1975 and 1981 and two petroleum exploration promotion&#13;
projects (Ln. 2065-KE and Cr. 1675-KE). Pipeline construction was completed on&#13;
schedule. The exploration promotion projects have been successful in helping to attract&#13;
six international companies to take acreage in Kenya, but no commercially viable oil or&#13;
gas reserves have been discovered to date.&#13;
3.30  The hydroelectric projects (1971 and 1975) concentrated largely on financing of&#13;
construction and equipment; execution of the physical components was generally good.&#13;
In the later years, lending shifted to strengthening the institutions with provision of&#13;
technical assistance and training, particularly for geothermal development. The Project&#13;
Completion Reports on all power projects concluded that while the objectives of physical&#13;
components were generally achieved, there were weaknesses in project design,&#13;
institutional, environmental and financial aspects, as well as in monitoring, and&#13;
procurement. The lessons learned from these operations have been incorporated in the&#13;
design of the proposed project.&#13;
3.31  The project has incorporated the recommendations of the Bank's policy papers on&#13;
electric power and energy efficiency, which emphasize the importance of transparent&#13;
regulatory processes, private sector participation, sector restructuring, and promotion of&#13;
both supply and demand side efficiency. ESMAP's recommendations for reducing power&#13;
losses have also been taken into account in the design of the project's efficiency&#13;
component.&#13;

4. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORIGIN, RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.1   Origin. A number of studies undertaken with IDA financing provided under the&#13;
Geothermal Development and Energy Pre-Investment Project (Cr. 1973-KE), the Parastatal&#13;
Reform and Privatization Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 2440-KE) and under a Project&#13;
Preparation Facility - have facilitated the preparation of the project. In the late 1980s, it was&#13;
foreseen that new investments were needed in the power sub-sector by the mid 1990's to avoid&#13;
supply shortages. However, IDA could not support new investments in the absence of an&#13;
agreement on sector reform policies and program for implementation. The following issues were&#13;
identified as requiring in the dialogue with the Government: (i) low electricity prices in relation&#13;
to the power sub-sector's financial requirements and to the economic cost of supply; (ii)&#13;
complexity of the power subsector organization (para. 3.18); (iii) need for annual update of and&#13;
adherence to least cost power expansion plan; and (iv) need to incorporate environmental&#13;
analysis in project feasibility studies; and (v) GoK control of petroleum pricing, procurement and&#13;
marketing. To address these issues, studies were commissioned on electricity tariffs; power&#13;
sector organization; least-cost generation expansion planning; and petroleum pricing,&#13;
procurement and marketing. These studies provided the basis for the policy dialogue which&#13;
culminated in an agreement with the Bank on a broad sector reform strategy in the framework of&#13;
the PFP for FY1994-96. The studies also provided the basis for further dialogue with the Bank&#13;
on the details of the policy reform during the preparation of this project. The project's Sector&#13;
Restructuring and Reform Component has been designed to assist the GoK in implementing the&#13;
most critical policy reforms. An Environmental Ranking Study was also carried out with Bank&#13;
staff assistance. In addition, environmental assessments have been carried out for three of the&#13;
five power generation plants included in the proposed project.&#13;
4.2   Rationale for IDA Involvement. IDA's participation in this project would support the&#13;
Government's development objectives and policies towards economic growth and poverty&#13;
reduction as expressed in the 1996-1998 PFP (para. 1.4). Mirroring the PFP, the Bank's Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy (discussed by the Board on January 30, 1996) emphasizes poverty reduction&#13;
as key to be met by faster growth, improved expenditures and targeted measures. This project is&#13;
an integral part of the CAS for poverty reduction in terms that it would stimulate economic&#13;
growth by: (i) improving and expanding basic infrastructure, which is critical to both improving&#13;
the efficiency of existing private sector investment and attracting new private investment; (ii)&#13;
improving public sector efficiency; and (iii) promoting private participation in energy provision.&#13;
Specifically, the project would eliminate the electricity shortages which are a key bottleneck to&#13;
economic growth, support the implementation of parastatal reforms in the electricity sub-sector,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
create an enabling policy and regulatory environment for private sector investment and&#13;
management, and improve the human capabilities in the energy sector. In addition, IDA's&#13;
involvement leverages about US$290 million in cofinancing and is critical in boosting private&#13;
sector confidence in Kenya's energy sector.&#13;
4.3   Project Objectives. The project's objectives are to assist the GoK in formulating and&#13;
implementing major policy and institutional reforms aimed at creating an efficient and&#13;
environmentally sustainable energy sector and to support investments needed to meet power&#13;
demand and increase operational efficiency. The project's specific objectives are to:&#13;
(i)   finance investments needed to meet power demand and improve the operational&#13;
efficiency in the sub-sector;&#13;
(ii)  reform the organizational structure of the power sub-sector to enable the operating&#13;
entities to function efficiently and on a commercially sustainable basis;&#13;
(iii)  create a legal and regulatory environment necessary for private sector&#13;
participation in the supply of electricity;&#13;
(iv)  support the GoK's adoption of economic pricing of both electricity and petroleum&#13;
products and implementation of demand and supply-side efficiency improvement&#13;
measures; and&#13;
(v)   develop indigenous geothermal energy resources and a strategy for sustainable&#13;
household and rural energy development.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.4   The project would consist of the following six components:&#13;
A. Sector Restructuring and Reform&#13;
B. Other Institutional Support&#13;
C. Efficiency Improvements&#13;
D. Power System Expansion &amp; Upgrading&#13;
E. Geothermal Resource Development&#13;
F. Future Project Preparation&#13;
4.5   A brief description of the various components of the project is given below, while&#13;
detailed descriptions are provided in the Project Implementation Plan and in Annexes 4.2&#13;
through 4.2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
A.    Sector Restructuring and Reform (US$3.6 million) - The project would support (i)&#13;
establishment of a legal and regulatory framework necessary to improve sector efficiency; (ii)&#13;
reform of the organization, management and financial structure of the power subsector&#13;
companies, and separation of generation from transmission and distribution functions; and (iii)&#13;
promotion of private sector participation in the provision and management of operations. Details&#13;
of the program are contained in Annex 4.2.&#13;
B.    Institutional Support (US$24.6 million) - This component comprises studies, advisory&#13;
services and logistical support to project implementing entities. The studies fall under four&#13;
categories. The first category consists of identified prefeasibility and feasibility studies, and&#13;
preparation of tender documents for future projects. The second category assists in determining a&#13;
strategy for sustainable and affordable household and rural energy development, and includes&#13;
energy supply and demand studies and policy and institutional analysis. It will draw upon the&#13;
results of the ongoing rural electrification study. The third category addresses consumer&#13;
concerns about the quality of solar photovoltaic components and systems and examines the&#13;
establishment of quality guidelines, including regulatory incentives to encourage the application&#13;
of minimum norms. The fourth category will seek to promote competition in the supply of LPG&#13;
to consumers through the development of uniform standards for LPG cylinders, valves and&#13;
pressure regulators and the associated testing, monitoring and regulatory arrangements '.&#13;
Advisory services comprise policy, engineering and financial management support to the&#13;
Implementation Support Group (ISG) in MOE which will be responsible for coordination of&#13;
project implementation. Engineering and financial management support will also be provided to&#13;
KPC for implementation of the power generation component. Logistic support in the form of&#13;
office technology and equipment will be provided to the ISG (para. 6.2).&#13;
C.    Efficiency Improvements (US$11.8 million)&#13;
(i)    Demand Side Improvements (US$5.4 million) - The project would assist in: (a)&#13;
developing capacity in KPLC and in the local private sector to design, implement&#13;
and evaluate efficiency and electricity demand management projects; (b)&#13;
establishing pricing incentives for energy efficiency, such as time-of-use tariffs,&#13;
and interruptible rates to complement the agreed tariff reforms; (c) conducting&#13;
demonstration programs on energy efficient lighting, air conditioning and other&#13;
consumer equipment in public buildings including KPLC's buildings; (d) mapping&#13;
out mechanisms for third party financing of efficiency improvement measures; (e)&#13;
establishing guidelines for energy efficiency labeling and standards for electric&#13;
appliances and motors.&#13;
(ii)   Line Loss Reduction (US$6.4 million) - The project will: (a) finance major&#13;
distribution rehabilitation and loss reduction programs in the Nairobi and the&#13;
The project activities in rural, renewable and household energy development support the recommendations of&#13;
the Bank's Best Practice Paper "Rural Energy and Development", July 1996 (report No. 15912-GLB).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
Coastal areas based on the results of the KPLC/ESMAP loss reduction study; (b)&#13;
assist KPLC to implement the ESMAP recommended program for the reduction&#13;
of non-technical losses; and (c) finance the required technical assistance to set up&#13;
an implementation plan and train a task force. Annex 4.3 details the efficiency&#13;
improvement component.&#13;
D.   Power System Expansion &amp; Rehabilitation (US$609.1 million)&#13;
(i)   Power Generation (US$579.1 million) - The objectives of this component are to&#13;
increase generation capacity and to install associated transmission facilities. The&#13;
component includes financing of: (i) a 75 MW Diesel Power Plant at Mombasa&#13;
(Kipevu I); (ii) a 64 MW Olkaria North-East Geothermal Power Station at&#13;
Naivasha (Olkaria II); (iii) a second 75 MW Diesel Power Plant at Mombasa&#13;
(Kipevu II); (iv) another 64 MW Geothermal Power Plant (Olkaria III); (v) a third&#13;
72.5 MW unit at Gitaru Hydropower Station; and (vi) connection of two&#13;
additional wells for the existing Olkaria I Geothermal Power Plant. KPLC's least-&#13;
cost generation plan which has been reviewed and endorsed by independent&#13;
consultants indicate that Kipevu I and Olkaria II would be needed to meet demand&#13;
starting in FY 1997/98, FY 1998/99 and FY1999/00 respectively. However,&#13;
because of delays in implementing the investment program (para. 1.7), these&#13;
plants are now expected to be commissioned in FY1999/00 and FY2000/01&#13;
respectively. Because of the urgent need to start construction in order to meet&#13;
these commissioning dates, these plants would be financed through traditional&#13;
public financing sources. Kipevu II and Olkaria III would also be commissioned&#13;
in FY1999/00 and FY2000/01 respectively. The two power plants are expected to&#13;
be constructed by independent power producers. The preparation work leading to&#13;
the award of contracts to IPPs is being supported by an IDA Project Preparation&#13;
Facility advance. A detailed description of the power system expansion and&#13;
upgrading component is given in Annex 4.4.&#13;
(ii)   Upgrading of Distribution System (US$30.0 million) - This sub-component would&#13;
cover implementation of a program for the reinforcement of the primary&#13;
distribution systems in Nairobi and in the Coastal areas. In the Nairobi area the&#13;
66 kv ring road around the city would be completed and the 66 kv-11 kv&#13;
substations capacity would be expanded. Reconductoring of some sections of the&#13;
66 kv lines would also be carried out to eliminate bottlenecks. In the Coastal area,&#13;
the program consists of increasing the 33-11 kv substation capacity in Mombasa&#13;
and along the Indian coast. In addition, a 132 kv line would be built between&#13;
Rabai and Diani. Details of the program are contained in Annex 4.4.&#13;
E.   Geothermal Resource Development (US$49.3 million) - This component would assist&#13;
the Government in developing geothermal energy resources. The project will also finance&#13;
resource development activities aimed at supporting production of power at the next power plant&#13;
(Olkaria IV), and developing resources for future private sector participation. Details of the&#13;
program are shown in Annex 4.5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
F.    Future Project Preparation (US$1.5 million) - This component would support&#13;
preparatory activities for the follow-on projects in support of the GoK's least-cost energy&#13;
investment program.&#13;
C. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
4.6    The total cost of the project is estimated at US$699.9 million equivalent, excluding taxes&#13;
and duties and interest during construction, broken down by component as detailed above. Of&#13;
the total cost, about US$570.1 million or 81%, would be in foreign costs. Total costs include&#13;
about US$36.5 million in physical contingencies or about 6% of total base costs; and US$42.5&#13;
million in price contingencies or about 7% of total base costs plus physical contingencies.&#13;
Engineering and construction supervision costs are included in the cost estimates for the physical&#13;
components at an average rate of about 10% of base cost. Price contingencies have been&#13;
calculated on the basis of estimated international inflation of 2.4% from FY1996/97. This&#13;
inflation rate has been used for both foreign and domestic costs as it has been assumed that any&#13;
differences between domestic and international price will be offset by equivalent adjustments in&#13;
Kenya's foreign exchange rate. A summary of the cost estimates is provided in Table 4.1 below&#13;

4.7   Project Financing. An IDA Credit of US$125 million would finance about 17.9% of&#13;
total project costs excluding taxes and duties. Other financiers would be OECF (about US$82.8&#13;
million); European Investment Bank (EIB) (about US$48.7 million), KfW (about US$20.8&#13;
million) and private sector investors (about US$262.5 million). KPC and KPLC would finance&#13;
the balance of US$160.1 million and about US$99.0 million of interest during construction.&#13;
Table 4.2 below provides the financing plan.&#13;

4.8   Project Onlending Arrangements. The IDA Credit would be made to the Government&#13;
of Kenya on standard terms. The Government would re-lend about US$104.6 million and&#13;
US$11.7 million equivalent to KPC and KPLC respectively. The balance of about US$8.7&#13;
million equivalent, not initially re-lend, would include funding for preparation of future projects&#13;
(US$1.5 million), institutional support (US$3.9 million), and sector reorganization (US$3.6&#13;
million). Since the preparation activities for future projects and some of the institutional support&#13;
activities cannot be determined in advance, the related funds would be relend to KPC and/or&#13;
KPLC where the activities concerned are of a commercial nature. The relent funds would be&#13;
provided for 20 years including 5 years grace, at an effective interest rate of not less than 7.7&#13;
percent. KPC and KPLC would bear the foreign exchange risk. Execution of subsidiary loan&#13;
agreements between the Government and the implementing agencies pertaining to the onlent IDA&#13;
funds, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, would be a condition of effectiveness (para.&#13;
8.2 (ii)).&#13;
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
4.9   The project includes substantive policy and institutional reform components which are&#13;
designed to create a more efficient and sustainable sector. The Sector Restructuring and Reform&#13;
component includes financing and implementation of three key reforms. First, the power sub-&#13;
sector is in the process of being reorganized to better establish commercial arm's length&#13;
relationships between the management of generation assets on one hand and those of&#13;
transmission and distribution assets on the other hand. The reorganization will clearly define the&#13;
ownership of power assets and the responsibilities for subsector debt. Second, the Government&#13;
will separate the responsibility for regulation of the power subsector from policy and from&#13;
operations. This will provide an environment for more objective decisions on important issues&#13;
such as tariff-setting and licensing, thereby making the subsector a more attractive destiny for&#13;
private capital investment. Third, the GoK has committed to opening up the power market to the&#13;
private sector for investment and operations. Under the project, two of the five power plants&#13;
accounting for about 40% of the generation capacity to be installed under the project, have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
already been offered to the private sector. In addition, the project will make significant positive&#13;
contributions to the Governments budget through payment of incremental corporate taxes,&#13;
dividends and interest on funds to be relent to the power companies (para. 7.20).&#13;
E. PARTICIPATION&#13;
4.10  The project was prepared in a collaborative manner with the GoK taking the lead role.&#13;
Environmental studies were prepared almost exclusively by local consultants. Local consultants&#13;
also participated in the preparation of the power sector reorganization and the legal and&#13;
regulatory framework studies. NGOs, both international and domestic, participated in reviews of&#13;
environmental impact assessments and attended meetings at the Bank's Resident Mission on the&#13;
project. Representatives of various civic organizations also participated in the review of tariff&#13;
increase proposals. Throughout the preparation process, discussions were held between IDA and&#13;
the donors had discussions. In early 1995 the Government briefed donors on the status of the&#13;
project followed by a donors' meeting in September 1995. The private sector has also been&#13;
invited to participate in the project through the offer of two power plants for independent power&#13;
producers. Evaluation of private sector bids has been completed and negotiations with successful&#13;
bidders are expected shortly.&#13;
4.11  During implementation, the following arrangements are foreseen for participation. With&#13;
regard to power supply, KPLC will monitor customer satisfaction through repeat surveys. The&#13;
monitoring and the implementation of any remedial actions will be supervised by the Chief&#13;
Manager Customer Care, a recently created position to improve KPLC's customer&#13;
responsiveness and service orientation. As part of the efficiency improvement component,&#13;
stakeholder participation will take place in the context of a number of action-planning&#13;
workshops. These workshops will discuss opportunities to improve energy efficiency and&#13;
disseminate information. Finally, the program evaluation will include a survey of stakeholders&#13;
satisfaction with the efficiency initiatives carried out under the project. The&#13;
Renewable/Household Energy component will ensure the participation of a representative group&#13;
of medium and low income households, rural industries, service establishments, energy vendors&#13;
through systematic surveys. In addition, NGOs concerned with rural and renewable energy&#13;
supply will be consulted. Adequate communication will be maintained with co-financiers, for&#13;
instance through shared missions.&#13;
F. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
4.12  The Project is classified as an Environment Assessment Category A. EAs were&#13;
conducted for NE Olkaria Geothermal and for the two Kipevu Diesel plants. A sectoral EA was&#13;
not carried out as the components were identified at different times. Instead of a sectoral EA,&#13;
KPLC decided to rank project components in order of environmental preference. This ranking&#13;
also served as environmental/social summaries for project components.&#13;
4.13  The geothermal site at NE Olkaria is located within Hell's Gate National Park, a park that&#13;
was created around the existing geothermal plant and with the knowledge that the NE Olkaria&#13;
site would be developed for geothermal energy. The area is rich with wildlife and serves as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
grazing area/migration route for Maasai pastoralists. Experience with the existing site shows that&#13;
wildlife accommodate quickly to the production wells and pipes and normally groups can be seen&#13;
grazing or resting in the shade of wells or pipes. The fenced perimeter of the existing plant has&#13;
interrupted livestock grazing although wildlife species are found within the active field. As a&#13;
part of the mitigation measures, the new facility will be fenced only around the wells and&#13;
separators so that wildlife and livestock will have continued access to most of the project area.&#13;
Since the facility will convert wild lands to other uses, Bank wild lands policy requires&#13;
compensatory actions. During negotiations, KPC agreed to take all necessary measures to&#13;
ensure free movement of wildlife within the Olkaria area and between Olkaria and Hells Gate&#13;
and Longonot National Park in accordance with the agreement dated September 20, 1994&#13;
between KPC and KWS (para. 8.1, xi). Currently, KPC assists KWS in the maintenance of park&#13;
facilities.&#13;
4.14  The EA for the geothermal facility recommended that condensates be reinjected as they&#13;
would be more harmful to livestock and wildlife than the condensates produced by the existing&#13;
plant. The reinjection is a part of the mitigation plan. The EA also closely reviewed water&#13;
extraction from Lake Naivasha and concluded that KPC extraction was far less than other present&#13;
water users and that the increased extraction for the new plant will not pose serious threats to the&#13;
lake levels.&#13;
4.15 The Kipevu diesel unit will be designed to meet western air emission standards and liquid&#13;
wastes will be treated on site. The facility will be built on land adjacent to the existing oil-fired&#13;
steam electric plant. The new facility will not require large amounts of water and it is likely that&#13;
it will be able to use water from a new waste treatment plant. It will not use Mombasa Municipal&#13;
water. The site will not involve relocating people and the land is currently unused and was a&#13;
former site of a WWII military installation.&#13;
4.16  Execution of the mitigation plans which are detailed in the EAs and in the Project&#13;
Implementation Plan would be monitored by KPC's Environmental Unit. KPC's staff would&#13;
receive further training, particularly in the area of environmental analysis for hydropower plants.&#13;
IDA implementation support missions would also include an environmental specialist to monitor&#13;
implementation of mitigation plans. During negotiations the Government agreed that adequate&#13;
environmental analysis would be carried outfor allfuture power sub-sector projects and&#13;
appropriate mitigation plans would be developed and carried out (para. 8.1 (ii)).&#13;
&#13;

5. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
A. THE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK&#13;
5.1   As indicated in paragraph 2.3, the organization of the power sub-sector is&#13;
complex. The complexities include:&#13;
(i)  financial rules regarding settlement of the costs of supplying power from the&#13;
KPLC-managed power stations owned by multi-purpose river development&#13;
authorities; and&#13;
(ii) the pricing system under which KPLC bears the full cost of the operations of&#13;
the two paper companies which it manages (KPC and TRDC), effectively&#13;
making the two companies mere cost centers.&#13;
5.2   Financial Rules. The two hydroelectric power stations owned by TARDA&#13;
(Masinga and Kiambere) supply power to TRDC and KPLC respectively. 'The original&#13;
agreements between TARDA and KPLC and TRDC provided for certain costs to be&#13;
borne by TRDC and KPLC. In the case of Kiambere, the lease agreement requires KPLC&#13;
to pay a development surcharge equivalent to 15% of the total cost of Kiambere; debt&#13;
service for the loans contracted for construction of the plant; and the cost of replacements&#13;
and repairs necessary to maintain efficient operation of the plant. The agreement was&#13;
structured so as to enable TARDA to obtain surpluses for investment on irrigation and&#13;
rural development projects. Between 1988 and 1990, GOK issued instructions directing&#13;
KPLC and TRDC to make payments for the cost of supply from the two power plants&#13;
(primarily debt service) directly to Treasury instead of to TARDA. The debt service&#13;
payments were also to be made on the same terms on which the loans had been provided&#13;
to TARDA. TARDA was to be compensated for the loss of revenue from the power&#13;
industry through direct payments from the Treasury. Following these changes, TARDA&#13;
became dependent on the Government for budgetary support. However, since 1994, it&#13;
has received annual payments of Ksh 55 million from KPLC to cover dam related&#13;
operation and maintenance expenditures (para 3.18 (c)).&#13;
5.3   The power sub-sector organization study has recommended that the revalued&#13;
power generation assets for Masinga, Kiambere and Turkwell power stations be&#13;
transferred to the generation company together with their related debt. The power&#13;
Although the lease agreement for Kiambere is between KPLC and TARDA, since FY1995/96 the debt&#13;
service costs for the plant are being in TRDC accounts. TRDC in turn recovers these costs from&#13;
KPLC. These anomalies will be corrected when the arrears are transferred to KPC as part of the&#13;
sector restructuring.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
generation company (KPC) would therefore be responsible for the debt service related to&#13;
the assets and for the costs of operating the facilities and would recover these costs&#13;
through tariffs from bulk power sales to KPLC. The Government has accepted the&#13;
recommendations and developed an action plan for reorganization of the power sub-&#13;
sector which includes as main features.' the establishment of separate companies for&#13;
generation and for transmission and distribution; the establishment and appointment of a&#13;
Board; and appointment of key managers for the new power generation company. In&#13;
January 1997, the GOK itnplemented the initial step under the plan by appointing a&#13;
Managing Director, Chairman and Board.for the new Keniya Power Company Limited.&#13;
The GOK also established a Task Force to oversee the sharing of staff and other&#13;
resources between KPLC and the new KPC.&#13;
5.4   Cost- Plus Pricing. In the power industry itself, excluding the multipurpose&#13;
development authorities, KPLC purchases power from KPC and TRDC at an "ascertained&#13;
cost" which is calculated as the total costs incurred by the supplier comprising all&#13;
operating expenses, debt service and a surcharge to provide a contribution towards new&#13;
capital expenditures. Although the two companies are essentially KPLC's cost centers,&#13;
they incurred substantial losses up to FYI 992/93. These losses are due to revaluation of&#13;
their foreign currency denominated liabilities which are not absorbed in the ascertained&#13;
cost calculation until they are realized in the form of increased debt service payments.&#13;
5.5   Since the GoK's sub-sector reform objectives include requiring companies to&#13;
operate on a commercial basis, the bulk tariffs between the generation company and the&#13;
transmission and distribution company would be determined by the ERB on the basis of&#13;
LRMC principles and the need to finance at least 20% of the generation company's&#13;
investment program during FY1997/98 and FY1998/99 and 25% for each fiscal year&#13;
thereafter. The responsibilities and duties of the ERB and the timing for its establishment&#13;
are spelt out in the action plan for the legal and regulatory framework for the power sub-&#13;
sector.&#13;
B. PAST AND PRESENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
5.6   Performance Targets. Under Credit 1973-KE, it was agreed that the power&#13;
industry would achieve the following financial targets:&#13;
(i) self-financing ratios of 25% in FY1988/89, 27% in FY1990/91 and 30% in&#13;
FYI 993/94 and subsequent years;&#13;
(ii) debt/equity ratio of 75% in FYI1990/91 and 70% in FYI1991/92 and&#13;
subsequent years;&#13;
(iii) debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5%; and&#13;
(iv) a current ratio of at least 1. 1.&#13;
5.7   In practice, monitoring the performance of the sub-sector proved difficult because&#13;
of the complex pricing arrangements, lack of clarity on such issues as asset ownership&#13;
and debt service obligations. However, the weakness in the sub-sector's performance are&#13;
apparent from Table 5.1 which summarizes the principal financial ratios for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
individual companies during FY1990/91 through FYl994/95. Actual financial&#13;
statements (FY1994/95) are shown in Annex 5.1 which also shows the projected&#13;
performance during FY1995/96 through FY2000/01.&#13;

5.8    As the ratios above indicate, for the fiscal years up to FY1992/93, the financial&#13;
performance of the three power companies was characterized by weakening capital&#13;
structures and significant liquidity constraints. In terms of profitability, KPLC's&#13;
performance was fairly good compared to the performance of the other two power&#13;
companies which experienced significant losses. For the power industry as an entity the&#13;
poor financial performance was attributable to low tariffs, high levels of debt service and&#13;
the depreciation of the Ksh. The average tariff was not regularly adjusted to fully cover&#13;
increased revenue requirements arising from higher operating costs and higher debt&#13;
service burden caused by exchange rate movements.&#13;
5.9    Chart 5.1 below shows the relative proportions of debt and equity in the capital&#13;
structures of the three power companies during fiscal years FY1991/92 through&#13;
FY1994/95. The chart demonstrates the weakening financial position of the companies&#13;
and the modest recovery that started with the March 1994 tariff increase and the&#13;
appreciation of the Ksh in 1995. Also noteworthy are the sharp increases in the&#13;
debt/equity ratios of both KPC and TRDC in FY1992/93 due to unrealized foreign&#13;
exchange losses which are not considered a cost in the ascertained cost formula until&#13;
realized and were therefore not compensated through the bulk tariff.&#13;
2 These ratios do not fully capture actual performance since they are based on accounting data which does&#13;
not take account of all the operating costs and debt service.&#13;

5.10   Chart 5.2 below compares the total internal funds that were available for debt&#13;
service' in each of the years FY1991/92 through FY1994/95 to the actual debt service&#13;
requirements. While both KPC and TRDC were able to meet their debt service costs&#13;
during FY1991/92 and FY1992/93, KPLC was able to generate from internal operations&#13;
funds to meet only 80% of its debt service costs in FY1991/92. KPC and TRDC were&#13;
able to meet their debt service costs during this period because the ascertained formula&#13;
guarantees them an adequate tariff to cover all their costs with the exception of unrealized&#13;
foreign exchange losses. Since FY1993/94, the debt service coverage ratios have&#13;
improved significantly for KPC and KPLC.&#13;
3 Total internal funds available for debt service is calculated as the difference between total revenues and&#13;
operating costs (excluding depreciation) before adjusting for movements in working capital balances&#13;

5.11   All three companies consistently had low liquidity ratios in the period FY1991/92&#13;
- FY1994/95. For KPLC this is because of delays in collecting receivables from final&#13;
consumers. As of June 30, 1995 receivables represented about 88 days sales revenue.&#13;
Some of the delays in revenue collection are due to problems in billing. A new billing&#13;
system has been installed and a contract has been signed with a foreign utility to assist&#13;
KPLC in strengthening its operational efficiency (institutional strengthening program)&#13;
including improving the metering and billing system. For KPC and TRDC, the liquidity&#13;
constraints are caused primarily by slow payments from KPLC. The increased&#13;
commercial orientation when the sub-sector is reorganized with separate management for&#13;
generation and for transmission and distribution, and KPLC's institutional strengthening&#13;
program would help to improve working capital management, thus enabling arrears to be&#13;
maintained at levels not exceeding 60 days sales revenue..&#13;
5.12   Despite the structural issues noted in paras. 5.1-5.5 and the past poor financial&#13;
performance, KPLC, KPC and TRDC have sound accounting systems and procedures,&#13;
and KPLC has competent financial management and accounting staff. Thus, financial&#13;
statements have been prepared broadly in conformity with generally accepted accounting&#13;
principles. In spite of this there has been serious delays in submission of audited&#13;
financial statements to IDA. Significant improvements in financial management and&#13;
auditing are expected to result from: (i) resolution of structural issues related to assets&#13;
ownership, debt service responsibility and pricing in the context of the reorganization of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
the sub-sector; (ii) the recent exemption of both KPLC and KPC from the provisions of&#13;
the State Corporations Act which has enabled KPLC to, amongst other things, appoint&#13;
private auditors for FYl996/97; and (iii) KPLC and KPC's commitment to endeavor to&#13;
schedule AGMs promptly following the end of each fiscal year. KPLC and KPC audited&#13;
accounts for FYI 995/96 were submitted to IDA about seven months and eight and one&#13;
half months after the end of the fiscal year respectively. Taking into account past&#13;
performance and the expected improvements during negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached that both KPLC and KPC would submit auditedfinancial statements to IDA&#13;
within six months of the end of each fiscal year (para. 8.1 (v)).&#13;
C. PROJECTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
5.13  Taken as entity, the financial performance of the power industry started improving&#13;
in FYl993/94 when the first tariff increase under the Government's new policy of&#13;
economic pricing for electricity was implemented. Projections for the next six years&#13;
indicate that the industry's performance would continue to improve due to the increases in&#13;
tariffs, assumed slower rate of depreciation of the shilling and improvement in&#13;
operational efficiency.&#13;
5.14  The key assumptions used in projecting the future financial performance for the&#13;
three companies are that: (i) the average tariff would remain 73 percent of LRMC; (ii)&#13;
fuel prices would increase by about 7.5% per annum between FY1996/97 and FY1997/98&#13;
and 5% per annum thereafter, and a fuel adjustment formula would be applied to recover&#13;
effects of fuel price increases through automatic tariff increases; and (iii) domestic&#13;
inflation rates would be about 7.5% in FY1996/97 and FY1997/98 and 5% per annum&#13;
thereafter. The financial projections assume further increases in the average revenue of&#13;
about 12% in FY1997 and about 8% in each of FY1998 and FY1999. The financial&#13;
projections are also based on the current practice which requires KPLC to finance the&#13;
local currency costs of KPC and TRDC investment programs. These contributions,&#13;
called development surcharges are treated as part of the generation companies revenues&#13;
(tariff) and are therefore reflected in the self-financing ratios. On the basis of these&#13;
assumptions:&#13;
(i)    KPC, the main participant in the investment program would generate&#13;
modest levels of self-financing, averaging about 20% in the first three&#13;
years and declining thereafter. KPC's financial performance would&#13;
require an early review of its bulk tariff especially with the phasing out of&#13;
the development surcharge system as part of the reorganization. This&#13;
would be upon completion of the tariff study in November 1997.&#13;
(Similarly KPLC's tariffs to final consumers would require further&#13;
adjustments to enable it to achieve the target self financing levels of 25%&#13;
in FYl997/98 and FYl998/99 and 30% in each fiscal year thereafter).&#13;
TRDC has been merged with KPC as part of the restructuring of the sub-&#13;
sector. The process of merging operations is ongoing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
(ii)   The companies' debt service capacity would remain healthy: the result of&#13;
the March 1994 tariff increase as well as the increase to about 73% which&#13;
is built in the projections.&#13;
(iii)  The overall financial health of the companies would be greatly influenced&#13;
by the automatic adjustment of tariffs to recover fuel price increases.&#13;
During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on the date for&#13;
completion of the tariff study (November 30, 1997) andfor implementation of agreed&#13;
tariff adjustments during FY1997/98. In addition, KPC would generate adequate funds&#13;
from internal operations to finance at least 20% of its individual investment program for&#13;
FY1997/98 and 25% thereafter. KPLC would generate adequate funds from internal&#13;
operations to finance at least 25% of its individual investment program for FY1997/98&#13;
and FY1998/1999 and 30% thereafter (paras.8.1 vii and viii). KPLC would also be&#13;
required to maintain their accounts receivable at levels not exceeding 60 days sales&#13;
revenue at all times (para. 8.1 (ix). During negotiations, it was agreed to revise the self-&#13;
financing targets downwards for FY1997/98 and FY1998/99 to take into account the&#13;
heavy investment requirements and the proportion offunding already indicated by&#13;
donors.&#13;
D.    AN ACTION PLAN FOR FINANCIAL REFORM IN THE ELECTRICITY SUB-SECTOR&#13;
5.15  What emerges from the analysis of the historical financial results of the three&#13;
power companies is significantly weak performance both in terms of failure to meet the&#13;
agreed financial covenants with lenders and in terms of failure to meet the sub-sectors&#13;
financing requirements. The financial performance of the power industry suffered&#13;
because tariffs were not adjusted to meet increasing operational costs and to meet&#13;
increases in debt service obligations arising from exchange rate changes.&#13;
5.16  The Action Plan for financial reform therefore includes: (i) establishment of a&#13;
regulatory process to set bulk tariffs for the public sector generation company and retail&#13;
tariffs to final consumers on the basis of LRMC and financial criteria; (ii) the recent GOK&#13;
authorization for KPC to adjust tariffs for changes in price of fuel and in the exchange&#13;
rate without reference to ERB; (iii) determination of tariffs from IPPs on the basis of&#13;
competitive bidding; and (iv) implementation of efficiency improvements through line&#13;
loss reduction; staff reduction; contracting out ancillary services to the private sector and&#13;
institution of performance contracts for parastatal companies. As a package of measures,&#13;
this action plan should help the power sub-sector to improve its operational and financial&#13;
performance and achieve the targets proposed under the Credit. The status of the action&#13;
plan is summarized as follows:&#13;
(i)    Reorganization of the Sub-sector. (para. 5.3).&#13;
(ii)   Autonomy to Adjust Tariffs for Fuel and Exchange Rate Changes. In&#13;
1994, the Electricity Bye-laws were amended to provide KPLC, with the&#13;
autonomy to adjust electricity tariffs for changes-in-fuel prices. GoK has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
also allowed KPLC to adjust tariffs for changes in the cost of debt service&#13;
arising from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Ksh with effect from&#13;
October 1, 1996.&#13;
(iii) Bulk Tariffs. A newly revised Electric Power Act providing for&#13;
establishment of an autonomous electricity regulatory board is expected to&#13;
be submitted to Parliament by Credit effectiveness (para. 8.2 (i)).&#13;
(iv)   Efficiency Improvements. A line-loss reduction component to be&#13;
implemented under the project is expected to reduce T&amp;D losses from&#13;
about 16% to about 13.5% of net generation in the next five years, thereby&#13;
reducing the amount and cost of generation needed to meet demand. A&#13;
staff reduction plan implemented by KPLC since 1994 had increased of&#13;
KPLC's customer/staff ratio from about 28:1 to 49:1 by the end of 1995.&#13;
KPLC has contracted out some ancillary services such as line construction,&#13;
cleaning, security and janitorial services. Further options for contracting&#13;
vehicle maintenance works, etc., are being considered.&#13;
5.17  Implementation of the sub-sector reorganization plan and the financial action plan&#13;
would be reviewed during IDA implementation support missions and a major review&#13;
would be carried out during project's mid-term review with cofinanciers by June 30,&#13;
2000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

6. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A.   OVERALL&#13;
6.1    MOE has prepared a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) containing a description&#13;
of the main features of the project; implementation arrangements; implementation plan;&#13;
and a monitoring and evaluation plan. The PIP would serve as a Handbook to assist&#13;
project implementation agencies in the execution of the project. Annex 6.1 shows the&#13;
table of contents for the PIP. During project implementation, the PIP would be updated&#13;
annually by MOE and reviewed by IDA's implementation support missions. The&#13;
implementation arrangements, implementation plan and monitoring and evaluation plan&#13;
are summarized below.&#13;
B. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
6.2   The Government of Kenya would have overall responsibility for implementation&#13;
of the project through MOE, KPLC and KPC. KPC which would become the sole public&#13;
sector generation company would implement the generation projects and geothermal&#13;
resource development components. KPLC would be responsible for implementation of&#13;
distribution systems and some aspects of the efficiency component. A GoK task force&#13;
established in early 1997 is allocating staffing among the two companies. The&#13;
reorganization is not likely to disrupt implementation of the project. An Implementation&#13;
Support Group (ISG) has been established within MOE to oversee the implementation of&#13;
the project. The ISG would comprise experts with experience in procurement,&#13;
contracting and construction of major projects, and financial management. Selection of&#13;
consultants (engineer andfinancial management expert) to complement MOE's own staff&#13;
would be completedprior to credit effectiveness (para. 8.2 (iii)). KPC would also, prior&#13;
to credit effectiveness, select consultants for its Project Management Teams which would&#13;
be responsible for management of the contracting process andfinancial management of&#13;
the project (para. 8.2 (iii)).&#13;
6.3   The specific responsibilities for project implementation would be as follows:&#13;
(a)   Sector Restructuring and Reform Component. MOE would have the&#13;
overall responsibility for implementation of the Sector Restructuring&#13;
Reform Component. The component would be implemented in&#13;
accordance with the timetable shown in Annex 2.1.&#13;
(b)   Efficiency Improvements. The loss reduction and demand management&#13;
subcomponents would be implemented by KPLC. MOE would implement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
the information programs studies and training. Action planning&#13;
workshops would be implemented by MOE in cooperation with KPLC.&#13;
(c)   Power System Expansion and Rehabilitation. KPC would be&#13;
responsible for construction of the power stations to be financed from&#13;
traditional public financing sources (Kipevu I Plant, Olkaria Power Plant&#13;
and the third unit at Gitaru Hydropower Station). Kipevu II and Olkaria&#13;
III would be implemented by project companies to be set up by private&#13;
sector investors.&#13;
(i)   Kipevu I would be constructed as a turnkey project. The&#13;
contractor's responsibility would include construction of the power house&#13;
building and all civil works as well as the supply and installation of&#13;
engines, generators, substation equipment; etc. KPC has already selected&#13;
the supervision consultants and received bids from construction firms.&#13;
KPC would have overall responsibility for project management and&#13;
control, while providing the required facilities at the construction site.&#13;
(ii)   Olkaria North-East Geothermal Power Station (Olkaria II).&#13;
KPC would engage consultants to assist with the contract process and with&#13;
project management during the construction of this plant. Contractors&#13;
would be required for the following six contract packages: civil works;&#13;
turbine-generator and auxiliaries; erection of substations; construction of&#13;
transmission; steam field development; and relocation of the existing X-2&#13;
camp. KPC has prepared bidding documents for all the contract packages,&#13;
however, the documents have to be updated.&#13;
(iii)  Transmission and Distribution lines would be erected by KPLC&#13;
except those required to link the above generation plants to the grid.&#13;
Consultants services would be retained to assist with the contracting and&#13;
supervision of works.&#13;
(d)   Geothermal Assessment and Resource Development. MOE would&#13;
carry out geothermal exploration and pre-feasibility studies as part of the&#13;
geothermal resource assessment and development program with the&#13;
assistance of an Advisory Board of Experts. Consultant firms would be&#13;
contracted to execute the geothermal feasibility studies included in the&#13;
program. The Advisory Board of Experts would also assist in carrying out&#13;
the feasibility studies.&#13;
C.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
6.4   The project would be implemented in accordance with the implementation and&#13;
procurement schedules in the PIP. The PIP contains the following information:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
(i)   detailed descriptions of the project components, budget and&#13;
implementation timetable;&#13;
(ii)  schedule of procurement actions including target dates for each step,&#13;
including standard procurement documents;&#13;
(iii)  schedule of disbursements for each component, including financial&#13;
reporting and audit requirements;&#13;
(iv)   detailed description of the roles and responsibilities of the implementing&#13;
agencies;&#13;
(v)   key monitoring and performance indicators for each component; and&#13;
(vi)  schedule of progress reporting and format of quarterly reports.&#13;
D. PROCUREMENT&#13;
6.5   Table 6.1 summarizes the project elements, their estimated costs and the proposed&#13;
procurement methods. The total value of civil works to be financed under the project is&#13;
estimated at US$135.6 million of which US$27.6 million would be financed by IDA.&#13;
Annex 6.3 provides a list of goods, studies and consultants services to be financed by IDA.&#13;
The goods would include the supply and installation of turbine generator equipment, under&#13;
ICB procedures, for Olkaria II Power Plant for which IDA would finance the foreign&#13;
exchange costs of about US$41.6 million. Procurement of goods and works in packages&#13;
estimated to cost more than US$200,000 would be subject to ICB procedures. Goods&#13;
estimated to cost between US$50,000 and US$200,000 up to an aggregate of US$200,000&#13;
would be subject to national competitive bidding procedures (NCB), while shopping&#13;
procedures would apply to those estimated to cost less than US$50,000 up to an aggregate&#13;
of US$200,000. Consultant services of US$25.6 million would be financed by the Credit&#13;
out of total consultants services of US$73.1 million. IDA would also finance studies&#13;
(US$8.5 million), training (US$1.2 million) and about US$200,000 of incremental&#13;
recurrent expenditures. Of the US$27.6 million in civil works to be financed by IDA,&#13;
about US$26.79 million would be subject to ICB procedures and the balance of about&#13;
US$807,000 would be procured through NCB procedures, such packages being less than&#13;
US$200,000 each. For works contracts to be procured under NCB procedures, advertising&#13;
including explicit bid evaluation criteria and public bid opening would be followed.&#13;
Interested foreign contractors would not be precluded from bidding for contracts let out&#13;
under NCB procedures.&#13;
6.6   Consulting Services, Training and Studies. Consulting Services, training and&#13;
studies to be financed by IDA are estimated to cost a total of US$35.3 million.&#13;
Consultants would be recruited in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency,&#13;
August 1981.&#13;
6.7   Review of Procurement Documentation. During project implementation, IDA-&#13;
financed contracts for goods and works above a threshold of US$200,000 would be&#13;
subject to IDA's prior review procedures. Contracts for goods and works subject to prior&#13;
review are estimated to account for more than 90% of the total value of the contracts. All&#13;
contracts for consultants services estimated to cost more than US$100,000 for firms and&#13;
US$50,000 for individuals and all training proposals would be subject to prior review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
However, all sole source contracts and extensions within these limits would be subject to&#13;
mandatory review. The terms of reference would require IDA's clearance. The IDA&#13;
supervision missions would selectively review contracts not subject to prior review. In&#13;
all cases, the GoK would submit signed copies of the contracts to IDA before requesting&#13;
disbursement.&#13;
6.8    KPLC's procurement unit which is attached to the Office of the Chief Project&#13;
Development Manager (CPDM) would process contracts for the power generation and&#13;
upgrading component and would be supported by consultants to be attached to the&#13;
CPDM. Bidding documents have already been prepared by consultants for two of the&#13;
four power stations to be constructed and operated by KPC, but would need to be revised&#13;
on the basis of the Bank's new standard bidding documents. Pre-qualification would be&#13;
required for the civil works and the supply and erect contracts for the turbine-generator&#13;
packages to be procured on the basis of ICB procedures and to be financed by IDA. The&#13;
ISG would provide overall coordination support, ensuring that accurate progress reports&#13;
are prepared and forwarded to IDA and participating donors, updating the PIP and&#13;
ensuring the use of the Bank's standard procurement documents.&#13;
6.9    Standard procurement processing times have been discussed with the borrower&#13;
and the project implementation plan has been prepared on this basis. The borrower&#13;
would update the procurement plan annually.&#13;

6.11  Disbursements for procurement of goods and works estimated to cost up to&#13;
U$200,000 would be made against statement of expenditures (SOE). Other&#13;
disbursements would be made against standard documentation. To facilitate payments&#13;
from the Credit, the borrower would establish a Special Account and would operate and&#13;
maintain it on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The account would have an&#13;
initial authorized allocation of US$5 million, approximately equal to three months of&#13;
expenditures under the project. The Special Account would be replenished following&#13;
application for reimbursement by MOE, together with appropriate supporting&#13;
documentation. The amount of IDA replenishment would not exceed the authorized&#13;
allocation. The Credit closing date would be June 30, 2004, with physical completion of&#13;
works expected by December 31, 2003. Since MOE would process payments under the&#13;
credit it would engage a financial management expert (consultant) to work with ISG to,&#13;
amongst other functions, facilitate the accounting and the payment process.&#13;
6.12  Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) - Disbursements for contracts of goods and&#13;
works estimated to cost up to US$200,000 and consulting contracts with firms costing up&#13;
to US$100,000 equivalent and up to US$50,000 equivalent with individuals would be&#13;
made against statement of expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
F. ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING&#13;
6.13  During negotiations, it was agreed that MOE, KPC and KPLC would maintain&#13;
appropriate records and accounts for expenditures under the project, including SOEs, as&#13;
well as the Special Account, in accordance with internationally acceptable accounting&#13;
standards, that such records and accounts would be audited by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA, and that the borrower would provide a certified copy of the auditor 's&#13;
report, including a separate opinion on the SOEs, and the Special Account to IDA within&#13;
six months of the end of each fiscal year (para. 5.12 and 8.1 (iv)).&#13;
G. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
6.14  MOE and IDA would carry out Project monitoring to ensure that the project is&#13;
implemented in accordance with the project implementation plan. It would be based on&#13;
monthly and quarterly progress reports to be produced by the implementing agencies and&#13;
consolidated and verified by the ISG. The contents and format of the reports were&#13;
discussed with the implementing agencies during negotiations, it would include: (i)&#13;
updated project costs for individual contracts and the total project, including the estimates&#13;
of physical and price contingencies; (ii) revised timing of procurement actions including&#13;
advertising, bidding, contract award and completion time for individual contracts; (iii)&#13;
status of progress for physical works as well as for the institutional and policy reform&#13;
components; (iv) implementation of environment mitigation plans for the main&#13;
components; and (v) an implementation completion report within six months of the&#13;
Credit's closing date.&#13;
6.15  IDA would monitor project implementation through field visits, implementation&#13;
support missions, reviews of progress reports and consultations with the borrower,&#13;
implementing agencies and participating donors. Principal performance indicators&#13;
(Annex 7.6), were discussed and agreed with implementing agencies during negotiations,&#13;
and will form the basis for performance evaluation. Estimates of the timing of IDA&#13;
missions, areas of focus, skills requirements and inputs are provided in Annex 6.5. By&#13;
June 30, 2000, the Government would convene a mid-term review meeting to be attended&#13;
by cofinanciers and implementing agencies. The objectives of the meeting would be to&#13;
review the overall status of project implementation, adherence to the project&#13;
implementation plan, and determine any required changes in design or implementation&#13;
arrangements needed to ensure achievement of the project's developmental objectives.&#13;
Specifically, the review meeting would focus on the status of progress in: (i) adjustment&#13;
of tariffs towards satisfying the power sub-sector's financial objectives and LRMC; (ii)&#13;
attracting private sector participation in power generation and management of operations;&#13;
and (iii) restructuring the organization of the power subsector to improve operating&#13;
efficiency and transparency in financial relations between operating entities.&#13;

7. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
AND RISKS&#13;
A.    OVERALL&#13;
7.1   This project is an integral part of the Kenya CAS, presented to the Board in&#13;
January 1996. The CAS focuses on reducing poverty through improved economic&#13;
growth. It identified the proposed project as a priority in terms that it would contribute to&#13;
poverty reduction by stimulating economic growth through: (i) the improvement and&#13;
expansion of basic infrastructure, which is critical to both improving the efficiency of&#13;
existing private sector investment and attracting new private investment; (ii)&#13;
improvement of public sector efficiency; and (iii) promotion of private participation in&#13;
power supply.&#13;
7.2   In line with the objectives of the CAS, the proposed project aims to: (i) eliminate&#13;
electricity shortages which are a key bottleneck to economic growth by assisting in&#13;
financing high priority least-cost investments in generation, transmission and distribution&#13;
facilities; (ii) support the implementation of parastatal reforms through the restructuring&#13;
of the power sub-sector and commercialization of existing corporations; (iii) create an&#13;
enabling policy and regulatory environment for private sector investment and&#13;
management; (iv) raise tariffs to cost recovery levels and restrict cross-subsidies to only&#13;
the basic needs of the poor consumers; and (v) promote greater efficiency in energy&#13;
supply and end-use.&#13;
7.3   The proposed project is part of Kenya's FY95 - FY2013 least-cost generation&#13;
expansion plan required to meet the demand up to FY2004 l. The project is technically,&#13;
financially and economically sound and is thus justified for financing. Its technical&#13;
design has been carried out by experienced international consultants and reviewed by the&#13;
Bank. The discounted present value of the project's net economic benefits is US $344&#13;
million, and the internal economic rate of return (ERR) is 17.3 percent, which is higher&#13;
that the opportunity cost of capital (12%). In addition, the project has a positive fiscal&#13;
impact (para 7.20). The salient features of the economic analysis for the power sub-&#13;
sector investments are discussed below.&#13;
IThe least-cost generation plan was prepared by KPLC, confirmed by independent consultants, and&#13;
reviewed and found acceptable by the Bank (available in project files).&#13;

B.    NEED FOR THE PROJECT, ITS SIZE AND TIMING&#13;
7.4    Need. The forecasts of electricity demand indicate that there will be sufficient&#13;
demand to absorb the output from the project facilities. The reference forecast (Table&#13;
7.1), which -- in line with the base case macro economic scenario in the CAS -- is based&#13;
on a 5.5 percent average annual economic growth, translates into an average increase in&#13;
electricity sales of about 5.6 percent per year, and an average annual growth in system&#13;
peak of about 6 percent. This is reasonable in light of the historical growth rates of the&#13;
same magnitude, and considering that there is currently significant suppressed consumer&#13;
demand waiting to be served. The forecast takes account of the growth moderating&#13;
impact of energy efficiency and demand management measures to be implemented under&#13;
the project, and tariff increases. A detailed forecast is available in the Project Files.&#13;

Source: KPLC&#13;
7.5    As Table 7.1 shows, the required generation is expected to rise slightly slower&#13;
than sales, owing to a reduction in transmission and distribution losses from about 16&#13;
percent of net generation in the interconnected system in FY96 to around 14 percent of&#13;
net generation by FY2002. This would be the result of the installation of two diesel units&#13;
at Kipevu, Mombasa -- to reduce longhaul transmission -, network reinforcement and loss&#13;
reduction investments under the proposed project.&#13;
7.6    Size. The project facilities - five generating plants - will provide a total of 338&#13;
MW of new capacity and upto 2,200 GWh of electric energy annually. In addition, the&#13;
60 MW Sondu Miriu hydro plant, to be constructed in parallel with the project, will&#13;
provide, on average, some 310 GWh of annual energy. The new facilities will replace&#13;
about 70 MW of old, inefficient thermal plant at Kipevu and Nairobi. With the net&#13;
addition of 328 MW, Kenya's power system will, under average hydrological conditions,&#13;
be sufficient to meet consumer demand through the year 2004, whereafter new capacity&#13;
has to be installed (paras 3.10 &amp; 3. 11).&#13;
7.7    Timing. The project is critically needed. All the investments are required as&#13;
soon as possible to prevent continued load shedding (para 1.7 &amp; 3.11).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C.    ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&#13;
7.8   Project economic rate of return (ERR) is calculated at about 17.3 %. The ERR&#13;
was calculated for the incremental net benefits after identifying the project's economic&#13;
costs and benefits as the difference between inputs and outputs with and without the&#13;
project. In the "without the project" case, system demand is not met even at the current&#13;
level, whereas "with the project", the forecast system peak and energy demand are met&#13;
through the year 2004 (Annex 7.2). In addition to new generation capacity, the energy&#13;
available for sale under the proposed project is augmented by the investments in loss&#13;
reduction measures. The distribution network rehabilitation and loss reduction&#13;
components of the project are justified also on a stand-alone basis. According to the&#13;
ESMAP report "Kenya Power Loss Reduction Study" (No. 186/96), the proposed&#13;
investments in the Nairobi and the Coastal areas have benefit/cost ratios of 21 and 27&#13;
respectively.&#13;
7.9   Economic Benefits. The measurable economic benefits of the proposed project&#13;
are two fold: (i) increased electricity sales made possible by the planned investments; and&#13;
(ii) fuel cost savings resulting from the replacement of the old and inefficient steam plants&#13;
and gas turbines by modern diesel plants burning lower value fuel. The benefits from&#13;
incremental sales are calculated as the difference between the forecast sales with and&#13;
without the project. The value of the benefits from incremental sales includes an estimate&#13;
of consumer surplus, i.e the benefit of increased consumption because of the availability&#13;
of lower cost electricity, indicated by consumers' willingness to pay for electricity service&#13;
over and above what they actually pay to KPLC. The analysis uses an average&#13;
willingness to pay for all consumer categories equivalent to about US cents 14 per kWh&#13;
in mid-1995 prices. With KPLC's current average tariff of about US cents 9.1 per kWh,&#13;
the consumer surplus is estimated at about 4.9 US cents/kWh (Annex 7.3 ). The fuel cost&#13;
savings are similarly calculated as the difference in fuel costs with and without the project&#13;
and valued at border parity prices. These savings are the result of the greater efficiency&#13;
of the new plants, and the substitution of the presently used gas oil and jet fuel by lower&#13;
value fuel oil, that will cut the average fuel cost per kWh.&#13;
7.10  Economic Costs. The economic costs of the proposed project comprise: (i)&#13;
investment in generation plant, transmission, and distribution required to meet&#13;
incremental demand and replace output from retired units. These costs include not only&#13;
the investments under the proposed Project, but also the Sondu Miriu hydro power plant&#13;
to be financed outside of the project as well as additional transmission and distribution&#13;
investments required for which KPLC will seek financing outside of the project; (ii)&#13;
incremental operation and maintenance costs; and (iii) incremental fuel costs. Economic&#13;
costs are expressed in mid 1995 prices net of taxes and duties (Annex 7.2).&#13;
7.11  Switching Values and Sensitivity Analysis. The switching values were&#13;
calculated for four critical parameters as noted in Table 7.2. The results indicate that&#13;
project economics are robust with respect to increases in investment, operation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
maintenance cost, and fuel costs, but that they show sensitivity to the demand forecast&#13;
and the value of benefits. Given that currently the demand is suppressed because of&#13;
supply constraints, the risk of overestimated sales is small. Regarding the value of&#13;
benefits, the estimated value is between KPLC's current tariff and the cost of alternatives&#13;
to grid electricity. It is, therefore, considered to reflect the consumer surplus adequately&#13;
(Annex 7.3).&#13;

7.13    With regard to the impact of possible delays in project implementation, the&#13;
sensitivity analysis indicated that project economics are relatively insensitive to moderate&#13;
delays. Given, however, that the Kenyan economy is already suffering from power&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
shortages, a delay in the commissioning of the generating plants would mean continued&#13;
electricity rationing and subsequently lowered prospects for economic growth.&#13;
Minimizing delays for the diesel and geothermal plants, especially Kipevu I and Olkaria&#13;
II - planned to be commissioned in 1999 and 2000 respectively - is particularly important&#13;
because these plants are in the forefront of the investment program. In contrast, a one&#13;
year delay in the commissioning of the hydro plants would have a less critical impact on&#13;
the economy, because part of the lost output could be compensated for by the diesels if&#13;
they are installed according to plan, however, at a higher cost.&#13;
7.14  The likelihood for delays is largest for plants for which financing has not yet been&#13;
identified, i.e., Kipevu II, and Olkaria III. Although negotiations with successful bidders&#13;
are expected to start shortly, negotiations may be protracted or rebidding may be required&#13;
in one case. To mitigate the risk of delays, the project preparation facility has financed&#13;
consultants to prepare the bidding documents and assist the Government in the&#13;
negotiations with the successful bidder (para. 7. 1 8).&#13;
7.15  Quantitative Risk Analysis. The quantitative risk analysis produces a&#13;
probability distribution for the ERR and the NPV based on the interaction among key&#13;
variables and the shape of the probability distribution of the variables. The main risks&#13;
affecting the project's economic outcome include: (i) deterioration in Kenya's economic&#13;
situation which would reduce the demand for electricity making the investments&#13;
premature; (ii) the value of benefits; (iii) delays in the commissioning of generation&#13;
facilities; and (iv) investment cost. The analysis used probabilistic risk analysis software&#13;
using Monte Carlo simulation to determine the probability distributions for the ERR and&#13;
the NPV. The results of the analysis implied an 80 percent probability of a positive NPV.&#13;
The probability of a negative return for the project is thus an acceptable 20 percent.&#13;
Lower than expected electricity sales growth rates, significant delays in the&#13;
commissioning of the facilities and lower than expected willingness to pay would&#13;
contribute to the negative NPV (Annex 7.4).&#13;
7.16   Other Benefits of the Project. In addition to the benefits discussed above, the&#13;
power restructuring and reform component will contribute to improving the efficiency of&#13;
the sector so as to increase its contribution to the country's overall economic&#13;
development. The project will help develop sound energy sector policies and regulatory&#13;
frameworks, which will create an enabling environment for private investment and&#13;
management. The project will assist Kenya to restructure the energy sector for increased&#13;
operational efficiency and establish economic pricing of energy. It will also assist in&#13;
establishing two privately owned and operated power generating plants, and to build&#13;
investor confidence in Kenya's energy sector. Training and technical assistance provided&#13;
under the project will help improve the human capabilities in the energy sector.&#13;
D.    RISK MITIGATION&#13;
7.17   Although the risk analysis indicated that the probability of a negative NPV is not&#13;
significant, project design and implementation were formulated to mitigate the risks of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
unfavorable outcomes. With respect to the deteriorating economic performance which&#13;
could result in lower than forecast demand for electricity - the Bank's continued broad&#13;
policy dialogue on the macroeconomic reform program, will help focusing the&#13;
Government's macroeconomic reforms on maintaining stability. Project design allows a&#13;
limited possibility to delay construction of plants for which contracts have not been&#13;
signed, in case of drastically lower than expected demand growth - an unlikely scenario.&#13;
7.18  The risk associated with delays in the commissioning of facilities has been&#13;
reduced for the publicly financed projects by preparing the bidding documents before&#13;
Board presentation. In addition, KPC's track record in project implementation is fairly&#13;
good. Nevertheless, given the large size of the Project, it will provide consultant and&#13;
advisory services for project implementation, engineering and financial management. For&#13;
the privately financed, IPP projects, the risk of delays has been partially reduced, through&#13;
financing under the Project Preparation Facility for consultant services for the preparation&#13;
of bidding documents. They were issued in July 1996, and several bids were received at&#13;
the bid closing date in November 1996. In addition, the agreed changes in the legal and&#13;
regulatory framework should contribute to increased investor confidence. Another risk is&#13;
delay in mobilizing the corresponding local financing requirements, that could lead to&#13;
implementation delays. The agreement on annual reviews of the investment program and&#13;
related financing plans is designed to minimize this risk. The agreed power sector&#13;
restructuring will also assist in improving the operational efficiency and financial&#13;
situation of the implementing agencies. Finally, IDA's continued macroeconomic&#13;
dialogue will help in keeping retail and bulk tariff adjustments on track to insure adequate&#13;
counterpart funding. The agreement on an action plan for the implementation of&#13;
adequate adjustments based on a Tariff Study - to be completed by November 1997 - is a&#13;
condition for the second tranche release of the SAC (para 3.21).&#13;
7.19  The capital equipment of the project comprise mainly of standard equipment and&#13;
the civil works are not significant, indicating a moderate risk for cost over-runs. To&#13;
mitigate these risks, the cost estimates include adequate contingencies&#13;
E.   FISCAL IMPACT AND SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
7.20  The proposed project has a positive fiscal impact (Annex 7.5). The net present&#13;
value of the project's contribution to Government budget is estimated at about US$ 160&#13;
million over a twenty year period. On average, the annual net revenue to the Government&#13;
is about US $30 million (about 0.5% of GDP). The main source of the revenue to the&#13;
Government from the proposed project is the margin between the interest rates KPLC and&#13;
KPC pay the Government on the relend proceeds and the concessional interest rates the&#13;
Government pays IDA, EIB and KfW. In addition, the Government would receive&#13;
increased revenue from corporate taxes and VAT on the incremental electricity sales.&#13;
The project will not crowd out public expenditures on other development programs, such&#13;
as health and education, because no counterpart funding is provided from the&#13;
Government budget (it is provided by the implementing agencies from their internal cash&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
generation). The proposed project would not affect domestic interest rates, neither would&#13;
it crowd out domestic borrowing: It is roughly estimated that US $50 million of the&#13;
about US $260 million in private equity and commercial debt for the financing of the&#13;
IPPs, would be raised within Kenya. This is a small share of the about US $3 billion in&#13;
outstanding credit to the private sector from the financial sector as a whole in mid-1996.&#13;
Furthermore, on an annual basis, the project's domestic borrowing would be only about&#13;
1/2 percent of the outstanding stock.&#13;
7.21   The structure of the proposed project is favorable for sustainability, because all&#13;
key stakeholders have an incentive to see that it succeeds. For instance: (i) the project's&#13;
positive fiscal impact should provide an incentive for the Government to solidly support&#13;
it; (ii) the project would provide both KPLC and KPC urgently needed financing for&#13;
priority investments, thus enabling them to reduce the cost of supply and sell more&#13;
electricity; and (iii) the electricity end-users would gain because of increased and more&#13;
reliable power supply. Finally, the project would create 3,000 - 4,000 temporary&#13;
construction jobs.&#13;

Dear Mr. Wolfensohn,&#13;
Kenya: Energy Sector Reform and Power Development Project&#13;
Letter of Power Sub-Sector Policy&#13;
Introduction&#13;
The energy sector plays an important role in the country's economy, in cerms of its&#13;
impact on the balance of payments, concribution to the govermnent's revenues, and share of&#13;
investment and employment.  The Goverrnent. therefore, accords a high priority to the&#13;
development of the sector in a cost-efficient and environmentally sustainable manncr. The&#13;
purpose of this lerter is to highlight the Government's sector development objectives, and the&#13;
policy and institutional reforms being pursued to achieve the objectives. These reforms are an&#13;
integral part of the design of the Energy Sector Reform and Power Development Project and&#13;
underpin che invesanenrs proposed under the Project.&#13;
The Government has undertaken several studies to provide a basis for formulation of&#13;
sector policies and strategies. A broad sector stracegy was developed and agreed with the World&#13;
Bank and che IMF and this is reflected in the Policy Framework Pacers (PFP) covering the&#13;
periods 1993-95 and 1996-98. In the PFP for the period 1996-98, energy seccor reform policies&#13;
have been articulated in paragraphs 35, :52, 53 and 54.&#13;
Policy Objectives&#13;
The sector's stracegic objectives are to improve investment and operational efficiency by:&#13;
- (i) separating commercial funccions from policy setting, regulatory and coordinaEing functions:&#13;
- (ii) implementation of power projects on the basis of improved leasc cost-investment planning;&#13;
(iii) creating more competitive market conditions in electricity generation and in rhe petroleum&#13;
sub-secror; (iv) restructuring power companies and requiring them to operate on a commercial&#13;
basis supoorted by a system of perfornance contracts and wich transparent financial&#13;
relationships; (v) adjusting the struccure of electricity prices to ultimarely reflect long run&#13;
&#13;

discouraging cartetizaLion; and (vi) carrytng outdcmand and supply-side efficiency improvements&#13;
in the power sub-sector and in industry.&#13;
Role of Government - Sector Restrucruring&#13;
The Government's principal role in a restructured energy sector will be t-hat of a&#13;
facilitator of development by providing a stimulus to invescment and growth through provision&#13;
of an enabling environment, policy formulation, regulation, monitoring and coordination. In this&#13;
respect, the Government will strengthen its capaciEy for regulating any market segments&#13;
characterized by limited competition and will improve the legal framework for che sector so as&#13;
.co effectively protect the interests of consumers, facilitatc private sector participation and&#13;
enhance the efficiency of operating companies.&#13;
In the power sub-sector, the Government's role will focus on;&#13;
i)    reviewing bulk and the end-user tariffs and approving adjustments in order to&#13;
meet thc financial requirements of thc power-sub-sector;&#13;
ii)    reviewing  power purchasing  arrangements to ensure that they meec the&#13;
requircments of the relevant laws of Kenya;&#13;
iii)   ensuring system reliabiliry and security;&#13;
iv)   licensing of power operacions on conditions intended to promote efficiency of the&#13;
industry and institution of concrols against non-competitive behaviour,&#13;

Restructuring and Commercializing Power Companies&#13;
Thc existing limiced liability companies (KPLC, KPC and TRDC) will be reorganized&#13;
by end of October. 1997, to place all the generation assets under one company and all the&#13;
transmission and distribution assets in another. The generation assets owned by che multi-&#13;
purpose authorities will be transferred to the new electric powcr generation company on&#13;
historical cost basis. by end October, 1997.  Assers rransfer between the new generation&#13;
company and the transmission. and distribution company will be Rffected on the basis of&#13;
replacement costs, taking inco account the residual life spans of the assets involved.&#13;
Liabilities relating to the generation and transmission assets will be transferred betwecn&#13;
and among the oarganizations on the basis of the current outstanding debts, save for the Turkwel&#13;
project.  The liabilities for the Turkwel project will be transferred on the basis of the&#13;
replacement cosr of the electro-mechanLical components. However, the new generation company&#13;
and the Treasury will work out the project's debt service arrangemenc over a period of twenty&#13;
years. Debt service for Kiarnbere will be transferred to the new generation company when ir&#13;
becomes fully operational.&#13;
The power comoanies will be required to operate on sound commercial principles. To&#13;
improve the companies' operating and financial performance, a system of performanc_ contracts&#13;
will be institured by June 30, 1997 for the two new electric powcr companies. Strcamlining of&#13;
sraffing levels in KPLC (the only company with staff) has been initiated and the customcr/staff&#13;
racio improved from about 36: t ac the end of 1994 to 49:1 by the end of 1995. KPLC has also&#13;
made subscancial progress in contracting our non-core services: both the security and janitorial&#13;
services are now 100% contracted out; and construction of Kilifi-Malindi 33kV line which was&#13;
contracted out in August 1995 was completed in January 1996. KPLC plans to contract out&#13;
more line construction work including 66kV lines in Nairobi area. Contracting out of transport&#13;
workshops and repair workshops is also planned.&#13;
Private Sector Participation&#13;
The Government Ehas decided to intoduce competition in the generation segment of the&#13;
electricity supply markec, so as to improve efficiency and expand che scope of resourc-s&#13;
mobilization by encouraging private sector participation. In this regard, invitations for private&#13;
sector bids for developmenc and operation of two power plants (Kipevu 11 Diesel and Olkaria&#13;
IIL Geothermal) were issued in July 1996. with November 29, 1996 being the closing date for&#13;
receipt of duly completed-bids. In addition co chese two power plants, all future power projects.&#13;
except multipurpose hydro schemes, will be offered for development, on a competitive bidding&#13;
basis, by both che privare and publiv sector companies  Private companies, together with the&#13;
proposed generation parastacal will supply electricity to che proposed cransmissicn and&#13;
distribucion company under long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).&#13;
As an interinm measure to redress the current power supply shortfalls, while projects&#13;
programmed for devclopmcen under the rolling five year least cost development plan are being&#13;
constructed, the Government has decided to have in place a 44-.5 MW oil fired plant developed&#13;
by an IPP, on a fast track basis. An IPP has already been selected through a competicive&#13;

The IPP will scll power to KPLC under a PPA.  On its part, KPLC has finalized similar&#13;
arrangemenns for an IPP to develop a 43 MW  oil fired plant to replace generation by retired&#13;
uneconomic thermal capacity at Kipevu.&#13;
In the petroleum sub-sector, the procurcmenc, marketing and distribution and pricing of&#13;
crude oil and petroleum products is already being carried our by the private sector. On Ocxober&#13;
27. 1994 the Government deregulated the petroleum  markets and removed the National Oil&#13;
Corporation of Kenya's monopoly rights to procure 30%  of the  country's crude oil&#13;
requirements, and allowed consumer prices to be market-deternined.&#13;
Least Cost Investment Planning&#13;
The Government will ensure that a rolling five-year energy sector inves;ment program,&#13;
including a least-cost power system expansion plan is updated annually and rolled over by onc&#13;
year. These documents will be submitted to IDA for comments prior to finalization and&#13;
subsequent implementation. All investments will bc ranked in tcerms of their imoact on the&#13;
environment and cnvironmental assessments will be carried out in line with the World&#13;
BanJk's/any other donor's guidelines for all planned projects. Mitigation plans will be prepared&#13;
anrd implemented for all projects with adverse environmental impacts.&#13;
Capacity Building&#13;
The Gcvernmenc will continue to build its personnel capacicy through training in&#13;
institutions of higher learning, middle level colleges and polyrechnics. and through participation&#13;
in seminars and workshops including overseas attachments in appropriate institutions to ensure&#13;
effective management and development of the energy secror.&#13;
Ener,y Pr:icing&#13;
The Government's energy pricing policies are aimed at encouraging efficient utilization&#13;
of electricity and other commercial fuels, prudent management of resourc:s dedicated to supply&#13;
and delivery of energy to consumers, ensuring the financial viability of energy enterprises and&#13;
generation of fiscal revenue.&#13;
In the power sub-sector, the government is commitred co adjusting generation tariff and&#13;
end-user cariff structure so as to ultimately reflecr long run marginal cost (LRMC) of electricity&#13;
supply to enable the sub-sector co achieve an operational profit and thus raise adequate capital&#13;
to sustain its investment programs and attract IPP invescmcnts in the gcncration segment.&#13;
As part of thc tariff adjustments process, in March, 1994 the Government increased the&#13;
average tariff level by 60%, which together with subsequent appreciation d2 the Kenya shilling&#13;
against the US dollar had raised che tariff level from about 54.5% to 67.5% of LRMC.&#13;
currently.                 71 4&#13;
Tariffs were raised to 75% of LRIMC wich effecc from October 1, 1996.  An update ot 7&#13;

basis for che Government to determine the magnitude and phasing of  Further adjustments&#13;
required to achieve LRMC, after t'aking due consideration of the cost of power from independent&#13;
power producers and the sector's overall financing requirements.  Scarting in 1994, the&#13;
Government has authorized KPLC to automatically adjust the level of ics tariffs so as co reflect&#13;
changes in the cost of petroleum fuels used in thermal generation of electricity. EFfective Ist&#13;
October, 1996, KPLC has been authorized to automatically adjust its tariffs to reflect changes&#13;
in the cost of external debts service arising from fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Kenya&#13;
Shilling.&#13;
The bulk tariff for sales of electricity by the public sector generation company will be&#13;
based on tie tariffs established through the LRMC pricing principle, as determined through the&#13;
regulatory proc-ss. In addition, the bulk tariff for sales of electricity by independent power&#13;
producers will be based on prices escablished through international tendering proc-ss.&#13;
Eaergy EtTciency&#13;
It is the Governmenc's policy to promote che efficient supply and use of energy. On the&#13;
supplv side, the policies and institutional reforrns to improve efficient provision of energy&#13;
include the reorganization of the power sub-sector, the planned introduction of private sector&#13;
participation in power generation, the contracting out of services to the private scctor, the&#13;
inrroduction of performance contracts for energy enterprises and screamlining of smTffing levels.&#13;
More specific measures to improve the efficiency of power supply include reduction of losses,&#13;
particularly in the discribution systems and installation of efficient generation facilities.&#13;
On che demand side manacement. the Government will encourage large consumers of&#13;
electricicy to even out demand, time of use and inrerruptible electricity tariffs will soon be&#13;
introduced. The Government will also promote energy audirs for commercial and industrial&#13;
consumers, develop a demand side management programme, make available information to the&#13;
public on efficient usC of energy and cost-effective technologies and encourage private sector&#13;
participacion in the delivery of energy efficiency improvemenc measures. Efficiency standards&#13;
for electric equipment will also be developed.&#13;
Renewable Energy&#13;
On new, renewable and rural energy, the Government will together with the private&#13;
secror promote the economic developmenr of new and renewable energy sources such as wind,&#13;
solar and biomass, particularly to complement energy supplies in areas not served by the grid.&#13;
The Government will regularly review its policy on import duties and taxes levied on solar and&#13;
wind- power equipment in order to ensure that these arc not higher chan those levied on&#13;
convencional electrical equipment and will also establish quality standards for phocovoltaic (PV)&#13;
and wind power equipment.&#13;
The Government attaches great importance to rural electrification and in chis respect a&#13;
rural clectrification master-plan is currently under preparation with technical assistance from che&#13;
African IDevelopment Bank (ADB) to among other things examine alternative options for the&#13;
provision of energy in che rural areas in a cost-effective manner, taking account of GoK's&#13;

Energy Efficiency and Demand Management Component&#13;
Background and Context&#13;
I.     The Government's overall strategy for energy efficiency, as expressed in its Letter of Sector&#13;
Policy, addresses opportunities at four levels. First, the introduction of macro-economic measures relating&#13;
to energy pricing and increased reliance on market forces, will foster an enabling environment for energy&#13;
efficiency improvements. Second, to increase the efficiency on the supply side, the power utilities will&#13;
implement a distribution system loss reduction program and install efficient generation facilities. Third.&#13;
KPLC and the Manufacturers' Association will develop electricity demand management and energy&#13;
efficiency programs. Fourth, recognizing that an appropriate institutional capacity is required to sustain&#13;
energy efficiency programs, the strategy emphasizes local capacity building and technology transfer.&#13;
2.     As a result of past energy efficiency initiatives, Kenya is probably on a better footing than many&#13;
sub-Saharan African countries. However, many initiatives have been dependent on donor and Government&#13;
financing, so their sustainability has not been granted. The history of low power tariffs has also impeded&#13;
progress. The situation today is more promising, the new tariff policy, the power sub-sector&#13;
reorganization, including greater commercial orientation and private sector participation will provide sound&#13;
incentives for increased efficiency.&#13;
Objectives and Components&#13;
3.     The objective of the energy efficiency component is to seek to develop and implement market&#13;
based strategies and programs to promote more efficient energy supply and use.&#13;
4.     The project has five components: (i) the KPLC efficiency improvement and demand management.&#13;
program; (ii) a study to investigate how the availability, affordability and attractiveness of efficient&#13;
electrical technologies could be improved through policy interventions at manufacturing, importing and&#13;
marketing levels, for instance through the introduction of efficiency standards and an appliance labeling&#13;
program; (iii) the Kenya Energy Management Program (KEMP), which is ongoing with the help of&#13;
technical assistance by ESMAP (will not be described here); (iv) an energy efficiency workshop; and (v)&#13;
program evaluation.&#13;
1. KPLC Energy Efficiency Improvement Program&#13;
IA. Supply-Side Efficiency Improvements (Distribution Loss Reduction)&#13;
5.     Although KPLC's aggregate system losses (16% of net generation) are not excessive, they are&#13;
quite high in some parts of the transmission and distribution system, and without improvements, would&#13;
increase to unacceptable levels. With the assistance of ESMAP, KPLC established an in-house capacity --&#13;
an Efficiency Improvement Unit -- which has established the level of system losses in Nairobi City and the&#13;
Coastal Area, which collectively account for 70 percent of total system load, as follows:&#13;
6.     Nairobi. As a result of a well configured 11 kV system supplied by seven 66/11 kV sub-stations,&#13;
the peak power and energy losses in Nairobi's medium voltage distribution networks that contain the&#13;
highest load concentration appear reasonable at present -- 2.6% for power and 1.8% for energy at present&#13;
loading levels. But, in the absence of system improvements, the power and energy losses would increase&#13;
to some 6.4% and 4.6% respectively over the next ten years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.3&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
7.     Coastal Area. In the Coastal area, where KPLC rely on long 33 kV feeders to supply load&#13;
concentrations in and around the Mombasa Island, the level of peak power and energy losses in the&#13;
medium voltage distribution networks are some 6.4% for power and 4.4% for energy. In the absence of&#13;
system improvements the power and energy losses would increase to 11.2% and 8.2%. respectively, in ten&#13;
years.&#13;
8.     Based on the above findings, KPLC has developed a loss reduction program for the Nairobi and&#13;
Coastal Area systems to be implemented as part of the proposed Project:&#13;
(a)    Nairobi: (i) upgrading of II kV feeders, and installation of new feeders: (ii) replacement&#13;
of capacitors on feeders; (iii) new 66/1 I kV substation at Kiambu plus new feeders to&#13;
link Kiambu to the LV network; and (iv) reinforcements in the LV networks&#13;
(b)    Coastal Area: (i) new 33/11 kV sub-stations at three locations -- Rabai, Tiwi. and Galu;&#13;
(ii) II kV feeders to link the above sub-stations to the existing LV network; and (iii)&#13;
reinforcements in the LV networks&#13;
IB. Demand-Side Efficiency Improvements (Demand Management)&#13;
9.     The economic viability of loss reduction programs, such as the installation of capacitors to&#13;
improve power factor in the MV and LV feeders, usually can be enhanced with the introduction of&#13;
electricity demand management (EDM) measures. To that end, and in order to alleviate the effects of load&#13;
shedding, KPLC's Efficiency Improvement Unit are working towards integrating cost effective and&#13;
complementary EDM measures into their operations. The Unit is presently focusing on EDM measures that&#13;
would target industrial and commercial customers to improve power factor, and shift demand away from&#13;
the peak load periods.&#13;
10.    To enhance the level of KPLC's customer service in energy efficiency, the proposed Project&#13;
would provide technical assistance to KPLC's Efficiency Improvement Unit to: (i) build an in-house&#13;
capacity on EDM to complement that for loss reduction; (ii) apply their skills on-the-job, drawing on the&#13;
extensive information already gathered from the loss reduction work to plan complementary activities on&#13;
EDM; (iii) design EDM projects; and (iv) implement EDM projects and strategy. The proposed project will&#13;
finance consultancy services and training for this purpose. In addition, key energy efficiency personnel at&#13;
the MOE would participate in major training events, while ESMAP would finance training to other&#13;
organizations and local consultants under the KEMP program.&#13;
11.    Training and Capacity Building in EDM. KPLC proposes to build its in-house capacity for&#13;
EDM work through a "twinning" arrangement with another power utility with an established track record&#13;
in designing and implementing EDM programs. The training that KPLC staff would receive under such&#13;
arrangement would be supplemented by their participation in seminars and workshops and by visiting&#13;
research and other institutions.&#13;
12.    On-the-Job Training on EDM Planning and Load Profile Surveys. In order to develop&#13;
comprehensive EDM actions, KPLC needs to build up a disaggregate demand management database. To&#13;
this end, KPLC needs to complement its feeder level load data with additional information on demand&#13;
profiles and end-use practices within the premises of key customers. Therefore, using a similar on-the-job&#13;
training approach that was successfully applied by ESMAP to build in-house capacity for loss reduction&#13;
work, KPLC will to engage EDM experts to assist in designing and carrying out customer load surveys and&#13;
data collection activities to yield information on: (i) daily load curves; (ii) load duration curves; (iii) power&#13;
factor at peak periods; (iv) load density; (v) load factors in key markets and customer groups; (vi) market&#13;
penetration rates of electric equipment and appliances; and (vii) impact of power outages. KPLC would&#13;
carry out most of the required surveys using its own staff so as to enhance its EDM capacity. A number of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.3&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
the surveys will also be contracted out to the private sector, including local energy firms, and the ESMAP&#13;
trained KAM professionals in order to create business opportunities for increased private enterprise&#13;
delivery of energy efficiency services in line with the Government's policy.&#13;
13.    EDM Program Evaluation and Development. The next step is to develop, evaluate and rank&#13;
different EDM options according to electricity savings potential and cost-effectiveness to achieve KPLC's&#13;
system requirements. The options include but are not limited to (i) power-factor improvement, (ii) load&#13;
management; and (iii) end-use efficiency.&#13;
14.    Power-Factor Improvement. The evaluation will identify the customers where power factor&#13;
improvement would reduce demand and develop a program to install power factor correction capacitors&#13;
either at the customers premises or on KPLC's transmission and distribution system.&#13;
15.    Load Management. Primary load management techniques include tariff rates (e.g. special tariffs&#13;
for "interruptible" or "curtailable" supply) which discourage use at times of system peak; and direct control&#13;
of customers' load. The technical and economic viability of re-structuring KPLC's time-of-use tariffs and&#13;
direct load control to create incentives for customers to use electricity in a way that minimizes KPLC's&#13;
supply costs will be evaluated.&#13;
16.    End-Use Efficiency. Depending on the survey results, the investigation would focus on programs&#13;
to improve the efficiency of lighting, cooling, heating, water pumping, and electric motors. These&#13;
measures would generally be implemented and financed by the customers themselves, but to reduce&#13;
transaction costs, KPLC will design and field test a number of services that it would offer to assist key&#13;
customer groups. Such customer services include: (i) collaboration with local energy efficiency programs,&#13;
such as the KEMP, to provide diagnostic services of electricity end-use practices; (ii) advice to efficiency&#13;
improving housekeeping measures, and to introduce energy monitoring and targeting systems; (iii) design&#13;
and implementation of action plans to assist customers eliminate in-plant power losses; and (iv) preparation&#13;
of specifications for bidding documents that would be applied by customers to procure technical services&#13;
from third parties to upgrade end-use efficiency.&#13;
17.    Study on Financing Mechanisms. Some of the efficiency improvement measures would require&#13;
consumers to invest in retrofit measures or equipment. The low implementation rate of the&#13;
recommendations of the past energy audits suggest the existence of funding problems and lack of&#13;
incentives. As the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency will improve with the increased tariff levels, the&#13;
issue of adequate financing mechanisms remains. Therefore, MOE in conjunction with KPLC, will carry&#13;
out a study to map out sustainable mechanism for third party financing of efficiency improving measures,&#13;
which may involve, for instance, leasing arrangements with industrial and commercial consumers.&#13;
18.    EDM Program Implementation. KPLC would initially implement the following EDM&#13;
programs that would primarily target the Nairobi and Mombasa areas to integrate them to the program on&#13;
distribution loss reduction.&#13;
*  Nairobi EDM Pilot Demonstration Project. This pilot project would target industrial and&#13;
commercial customers in a well defined area, for example those that are supplied from the&#13;
existing 66/11 kV sub-stations located at Industrial Area and Nairobi South. The primary aim&#13;
is to encourage the customers to improve power factor levels, shift operations away from&#13;
evening peak periods, and replace obsolete and inefficient end-use equipment.&#13;
* Mombasa EDM Pilot Demonstration Project. This pilot project would target mainly&#13;
commercial but also industrial customers in the area supplied primarily from the Kipevu sub-&#13;
station and its network of 33 kV feeders. These include hotels and other commercial loads&#13;
that are supplied from the existing LV network; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.3&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
* Western Kenva. KPLC would study the viability of extending the coverage of EDM&#13;
measures to the Western Distribution areas, where the principal targets would include&#13;
industries that also may have significant potential to contribute energy to the grid through co-&#13;
generation.&#13;
*  EDM Promotional Activities in the Commercial Sector. In order to demonstrate the cost&#13;
effectiveness and economic benefits of energy efficiency improvements in commercial and&#13;
institutional buildings, KPLC's demonstration activities would include: (i) the retrofit of&#13;
KPLC's headquarters building, especially the banking hall in Nairobi with energy efficient&#13;
lighting and promotional exhibits; and (ii) the retrofit of at least two other buildings which&#13;
would be selected to reflect the KPLC customer mix in the Nairobi and Mombasa load&#13;
centers. KPLC would also in collaboration with professional bodies to provide advisory to&#13;
building owners, management companies and designers.&#13;
* EDM Promotional Activities for the Residential Sector. For the residential sector, KPLC's&#13;
initial thrust would be to promote "good practice" in end-use energy efficiency through the&#13;
activities of the existing KPLC Demonstration Center in Nairobi, which caters especially to&#13;
women and students. The Center would be modernized and equipped with efficient lights and&#13;
appliances, etc. It would set-up exhibits on efficient lights and other energy saving household&#13;
devices.&#13;
2. Energy Efficiency Standards and Labeling Program for Electric Appliances and Motors&#13;
19.    Objectives. This activity will support and expand on activities at the end-use level, in particular&#13;
to address the question of how the availability, affordability and attractiveness of efficient electrical&#13;
technologies could be improved through policy interventions at manufacturing, importing and marketing&#13;
levels, for instance through manufacturing incentives, efficiency standards, and labeling and information&#13;
programs. The objectives are to:&#13;
i   Analyze the potential energy savings that could be achieved through improving the&#13;
efficiency of appliances and motors;&#13;
-   Identify the technical and policy measures needed to improve the efficiency of appliances&#13;
and electric motors in Kenya;&#13;
*   Analyze the implications of implementing such improvements in terms of the production&#13;
changes needed, the effects on prices, impacts on import/export of appliances and motors,&#13;
and institutional requirements;&#13;
*   Analyze the cost effectiveness of implementing efficiency standards and a labeling program;&#13;
*   If implementation of efficiency standards and labeling program is shown to be cost-effective,&#13;
then select the most promising technologies and strategies (addressing issues such as&#13;
financing and institutional responsibilities) for further action, and develop preliminary&#13;
implementation documents, such as a draft set of appliance/motor efficiency standards and a&#13;
proposal for a labeling program.&#13;
*   Propose an effective legal/regulatory framework for implementing the proposed program.&#13;
20.    Implementation. The activity will be implemented by MOE in collaboration with the Ministry of&#13;
Trade and Industries (MOTI). A detailed project implementation plan will be produced following a Project&#13;
Planning Workshop that will gather the major stakeholders including the Kenya Bureau of standards,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.3&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
MOE, KPLC, MOTI, and organizations such as the Kenya Association of Manufacturers. The workplan&#13;
will include components to:&#13;
*    Review international experience with standards implementation;&#13;
*    Review current manufacturing and import activities, and market status; and&#13;
*    Review the national legislative and regulatory context (import tariffs, etc.);&#13;
21.      Following the completion of the above activities and the production of the draft report, an Action&#13;
Planning Workshop wi]l be held to present and review project outputs and discuss the further curse of&#13;
action with all stakeholders.&#13;
3. Energy Efficiency Workshop&#13;
22.     Once the survey data is available from the KPLC and KEMP energy surveys and audits, and the&#13;
preliminary results has been obtained from the Efficiency Standards Study, a workshop will be held to&#13;
discuss and disseminate the results and explore further options to improving efficiency. The workshop will&#13;
target major energy users in the industrial and commercial sectors.&#13;
4. Program Evaluation&#13;
23.      At the end of the third year of implementation, an independent audit and evaluation will be carried&#13;
out to investigate the programs' effectiveness, customer satisfaction and propose a further course of action.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements and Estimated Costs&#13;

KENYA&#13;
ENERGY SECTOR REFORM AND POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Description of the Power System Expansion and Rehabilitation Component&#13;
A.     Power Generation&#13;
Kipevu Diesel-Electric Plant&#13;
1.     Background. The desirability of constructing a large oil fired thermal generating plant on the&#13;
coast of Kenya has featured in electric sector planning for a number of years. However, it was not until the&#13;
1 990s that electricity supply/demand forecasts indicated a need to proceed with this new power project&#13;
within a definite timetable. Currently loss of load expectation in the Kenyan interconnected system in an&#13;
average hydrological year is such that shedding can be expected every day of the year. The design&#13;
criterion is for load shedding to be expected in no more than ten days in a dry year. Consequently the&#13;
system is now considerably less reliable than intended and in the event of a dry period occurring, or major&#13;
failure of units, as has been the case at Gitaru hydropower plant, extensive load shedding will be required&#13;
with the resulting adverse economic impact. New capacity in the range of 150 MW is therefore urgently&#13;
needed to return the power system to somewhere near its design level of reliability. Screening analysis&#13;
demonstrated that from among the potential candidate generation options considered (oil and coal fired&#13;
steam plant; gas turbines in combined and open cycle; medium and low-speed diesel engines; geothermal;&#13;
and hydro projects) the diesel options are least cost for supporting the power system demand. The&#13;
appropriate site for installing this diesel-electric power station is Mombassa given the fuel supply&#13;
requirements.&#13;
2.     The rationale for the Kipevu diesel-electric project are therefore threefold:&#13;
*   to add further installed generation capacity in response to the country's projected increase in&#13;
demand over the short-medium term;&#13;
*   to help achieve greater reliability, security and stability of power supply within the&#13;
interconnected grid; and&#13;
*   to help produce a more satisfactory balance between energy sources for electricity&#13;
generation.&#13;
3.     General Characteristics of the Power Plant. The Plant would be developed in two stages of 75&#13;
MW net each. It is planned that the first stage would be implemented by the public sector (KPC), while the&#13;
second phase would be built, owned, maintained and operated by an Independent Power Producer (IPP).&#13;
Electric power produced at this second stage would be purchased by KPLC through a Power Purchase&#13;
Agreement (PPA).&#13;
4.     The proposed power station would be located at Kipevu near the existing thermal power station.&#13;
The area is restricted and hilly. Leveling will be done for both stages of the power station simultaneously.&#13;
Site investigations, including appropriate borehole drilling, were carried out by a reputable engineering&#13;
firm, and concluded that the hilltop area next to the existing power station has competent foundation&#13;
condition for the new power plant.&#13;
5.     Feasibility studies for the Kipevu Diesel-Electric Power Scheme were carried out by a reputable&#13;
engineering firm. The feasibility-level design calls for two adjacent power stations each with 12.5 MW&#13;
medium-speed diesel-electric sets burning heavy fuel oil (No. 6 HFO). Net capacity of each station would&#13;
be 75 MW. Fuel oil would be supplied via pipeline, either directly from the Mombassa Port nearby (less&#13;
than 1.0 km) or from Mombassa Refinery (7 km). This provides dual sourcing and gives an enhanced level&#13;
of security. Nevertheless, a strategic reserve of 30 days will be kept on site. The confines of the available&#13;
site requires that a central fuel storage area be provided for both stages of the power station, with provision&#13;
for separation within this area. It is proposed therefore that two bulk tanks be provided, each 900 cubic&#13;
meters capacity, surrounded by a common bond and with individual designated unloading and forwarding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.4&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
facilities. An emergency transfer line interconnecting the two tanks would be provided to enable cross&#13;
supply of fuel and to permit tanks to be emptied for maintenance. From the bulk storage tanks, fuel would&#13;
be supplied to two large service tanks adjacent to the engine room of each stage, to await treatment. These&#13;
tanks would be sized to hold 250 cubic meters. Similar tanks would be provided post-treatment, giving&#13;
each stage 1.000 cubic meters on-site storage. Total strategic reserve would amount therefore for both&#13;
stages together to 3,800 cubic meters.&#13;
6.     Each stage of the power station would be self-contained, with separate engine rooms, auxiliaries&#13;
and step up substations. The diesel engine will be driving directly coupled synchronous generators. A&#13;
main supplying water from Mombassa runs near the project site. The quality and quantity of water is&#13;
considered adequate to meet the need of a closed-circuit non-evaporative cooling water system and&#13;
therefore it will not be necessary to provide a major water supply, nor a water treatment plant. The cooling&#13;
system would be provided with air blast radiators.&#13;
7.     Combustion air would be drawn from outside the engines powerhouse building, via intake filters&#13;
to minimize intake of airborne dust particles and insects. An exhaust gas system would be provided for&#13;
each diesel-electric set, which will include an exhaust heat-recovery boiler to provide steam or pressurized&#13;
hot water to supply all fuel heating requirements. After crossing the heat-recovery boiler, the exhaust&#13;
gases will be conducted to a common chimney stack for each stage of the power station.&#13;
8.     Fuel oil and lubricating oil sludge would be piped to a station collecting tank (one for each stage).&#13;
From there it would be treated in a dedicated treatment system. Separated concentrated sludge would be&#13;
discharged into an incinerator, while oily water would go to a separator. From this separator clean water&#13;
would pass to the drain system and oil would be returned to the sludge tank for further treatment.&#13;
9.     The fuel treatnent plant would draw fuel from the two heavy fuel pretreatment tanks. The fuel&#13;
treatment will comprise two 100% duty fuel treatment modules in parallel. Each module would include&#13;
fuel heaters and automatic fuel centrifuges.&#13;
10.    Power generated in each stage of the power station will be stepped up to 132 kV. Generators will&#13;
be connected in pairs via two-winding transformers to the gas-insulated 132 kV switchgear.&#13;
Within these parameters, specification of the exact unit size will be a matter for the tenderers, so&#13;
long as the net capacity of each state is achieved. The general plant design must aim for: (i) high operating&#13;
efficiency and low generating cost; and (ii) high reliability and long useful life.&#13;
II.    Concerning the second stage of the power station, the terms and conditions of tender document&#13;
will contain a Minimum Functional Specifications (MFS) for the plant, which will act as guide for bidders.&#13;
Subject to complying with the MFS parameters, bidders will be free to propose the plant configuration,&#13;
capacity and design which they wish, subject to space limitations.&#13;
12.    Environmental Aspects. A comprehensive environmental impact assessment has been carried&#13;
out by competent consultants. From this assessment it appears that the project would have the following&#13;
adverse environmental effects that would need to be mitigated: (i) emission of contaminants from fuel&#13;
combustion; (ii) noise from engines operation and from air-cooled radiators; (iii) oil spill accidents; and&#13;
(iv) sludge from fuel and lube oil&#13;
13.    The measures that would need to be taken to mitigate these environmentally undesirable effects,&#13;
are the following:&#13;
* contaminants emissions would have to meet World Bank guidelines; in addition, the exhaust&#13;
gases after cooling in heat-recovery boilers would be dispersed by means of high stacks&#13;
(minimum 60 m high); contaminants dispersion would be aided by the fact that the power&#13;
station would be sighted on a high bluff receiving sea breeze;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.4&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
*   engines air intakes and exhaust would be equipped with silencers adequate to meet noise&#13;
level requirements around the power station building. Control room would be sound-&#13;
proofed, and sound proof booths would have to be provided in the machine halls. Silencers&#13;
would be adapted to air-cooled radiators. In addition, the power plant would be screened by&#13;
rows of trees;&#13;
*   oil spills would be contained by appropriate bunds around tanks; and&#13;
*  sludge from fuel and lubricant would be treated and after separation burned in incinerators.&#13;
Third Unit at Gitaru Hydropower Plant&#13;
14.    The existing powerhouse at Gitaru Hydropower Plant is underground with two 72.5 MW&#13;
generating units. Provision was left in the original design for the future addition of a third unit. Penstock&#13;
with bolting flange for turbine intake and draft turbine connections including gates have already being&#13;
installed. The work to be done in order to commission the third unit consists of: (i) Turbine; (ii) Main&#13;
inlet value; (iii) Generator and exciter; (iv) Concrete for embedded; (v) Low voltage switchgear; (vi) Bus&#13;
duct to main transformer; (vii) Main generator transformer; (viii) Auxiliaries, pumps, etc.; (ix) Control&#13;
panels and relays; and (x) B2kV switchgear with breaker and isolators.&#13;
15.    January 1995, a fault develop in one of the generators forcing shutdown of the unit. The fault,&#13;
apparently due to aging of the varnish covering the stator core steel sheets at core joints, thus causing the&#13;
development of hot spots due to the eddy currents generated. The stator windings suffered consequent&#13;
damage from these hot spots, until failure of the insulation resulted. Repair work took about a year and&#13;
was completed in March 1996. The units at Gitaru are the largest in KPLC power system and the&#13;
prolonged outage of one of the units has adverse effects on the power system ability to meet peak demand&#13;
and has forced load shedding measures. Moreover, recent tests on the faulty generator have detected flaws&#13;
in the generators stator core joints. Therefore, on recommissioning, the unit could not be restored to its full&#13;
rated output of 72.5 MW without risking further faults. The other generator will also require inspection to&#13;
ascertain the state of the generator stator core. Indications at the moment are that the faulty unit would&#13;
have to be limited to a maximum load of 60 MW, the KPLC power system would have serious constraints.&#13;
The installation of the third unit, therefore, becomes an unavoidable necessity. On average, Gitaru Power&#13;
Station produces 840 GWh per year with both units in operation. With only one unit, as has been the&#13;
situation in 1995, the power station will generate about 500 GWh per year. The loss in energy production&#13;
from a fault in one unit is a minimum of 340 GWh a year while the defect is corrected.&#13;
16.    Commissioning of the third unit for Gitaru Hydropower Plant would result in the following&#13;
effective capacity of: (i) 2 x 60 MW plus I x 70 MW= 190 MW; and (ii) 763 GWh from original units plus&#13;
112 GWh from the third unit for a total of 875 GWh per year.&#13;
17.    The addition of a third unit at Gitaru would have no detrimental environmental impact.&#13;
Procurement of the unit would be by ICB. A span of 3 years is foreseen for design, tendering&#13;
manufacturing, transport and installation.&#13;
Olkaria II Geothermal Power Plant (2x32 MW)&#13;
18.    The Olkaria If power plant - with an installed capacity of 64 MW in two units of 32 MW - will be&#13;
located at the northeast part of the Olkaria geothermal field. Steam will be collected from the steamfield -&#13;
already developed with 29 wells (out of which 20 are capable of providing steam for 78 MW - an average&#13;
of 3.4 MW/well). Reservoir engineering studies indicate that the geothermal field can support the electric&#13;
power generation of 64 MW during the life of plant i.e., 30 years, with pressure and temperature within&#13;
the required values for power generation and without detrimental impact upon the production of the&#13;
existing Olkaria I power plant. The non-productive wells will be utilized for the reinjection of the residual&#13;
waters. Steam separation will be carried-out at a number of sites around the geothermal field and steam&#13;
transmitted through the gathering system to the steam turbines at the power plant. The non-condensable&#13;
gases will be dispersed through the cooling towers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.4&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
19.    The plant will be of a modified modular type. In a modular geothermal power plant, the upward&#13;
exhaust turbine, gets to the site tested and assembled in a module, the generator is modularized separatelv&#13;
with the rotor assembled in the stator, and the direct contact condenser mounted outdoors, everything&#13;
installed on a concrete floor using a low level arrangement. The idea is to avoid as much as possible the&#13;
excavations and civil works required by the conventional arrangement. KPC and its consultants, as a&#13;
transition from the conventional design to the modular concept, accepted most of the modularization&#13;
except in two aspects: (i) all equipment, except the condenser is placed indoors in several buildings&#13;
carefully designed to blend with the environment of the Hell's Gate National Park, and (ii) the commonly&#13;
used direct contact condenser was changed to a condenser with a barometric leg requiring a seal pit.&#13;
20.    The designs of the civil works specify a power house superstructure with reinforced concrete&#13;
columns and concrete beams for a traveling crane. Deep piled foundations for all major structures are&#13;
required and thus specified. In addition, the project civil works include the provision of 65 staff houses,&#13;
comprising 36 junior staff and 29 senior staff.&#13;
21.     The steam transmission or gathering system designs were based on the prediction of the 20 wells&#13;
selected for production. The current design proposes the use of separators with integral water drums. The&#13;
separators have been standardized for three steam flow capacities 25, 50, and 100 tones/hour. The design&#13;
specifies three separator stations of 25 t/h, seven of 50 t/h, and three of 100 t/h. Using these dispersed&#13;
number of separator stations minimizes the amount of two phase flow and corresponding losses. Motorized&#13;
wellhead flow control valves will be installed. Discharge silencers will be provided at each separation&#13;
station.&#13;
22.    The design of the reinjection sy'stem comtemplates only cold reinjection of the waters from the&#13;
separator stations. The residual waters will be conveyed by steel gravity pipes to two main conditioning&#13;
and cooling ponds. From these ponds the fluids flow to the main overflow pond and a reinjection sump&#13;
from which they will be pumped to the reinjection wells. The reinjection system will be refined to included&#13;
a hot reinjection system - which will become the primary reinjection system. In the hot reinjection system,&#13;
the hot waters from the separators will be conveyed directly by steel pipes to the reinjection wells (wells&#13;
R2 and R3 are already available), without passing through the silencers and the cooling ponds. With the&#13;
hot reinjection system, the well head pressures are improved thereby prolonging the life time of the system.&#13;
A system with both hot and cold reinjection improves the management of the reservoir and provides&#13;
greater flexibility of field operations.&#13;
23.    The designs of the electro-mechanical works include: (a) a single flashed steam condensing&#13;
turbine cycle; (b) two 32 MW single shaft, single flow turbines, mounted at ground level with the&#13;
condenser located adjacently; (c) a barometricalily drained condenser into a seal pit, where vertical shaft&#13;
pumps will pump the condensate water to the cooling towers; the condenser will incorporate an integral gas&#13;
cooler; (c) a steam ejector or gas extraction system which will disperse the non-condensable gases through&#13;
the cooling tower plume; (d) mechanical induced draught cooling towers aligned parallel to the prevailing&#13;
wind direction will be provided as well as (e) two electric generators with an output capacity of 32 MW at&#13;
a power factor of 0.8, that will generate electricity at II KV.&#13;
24.    The power plant will be connected to the national grid at 220 KV through a 220 KV substation&#13;
located adjacent to the plant. A double circuit 220 KV line will feed power to a new substation in Nairobi&#13;
(Nairobi North) and the existing Dandora 220/132 KV substation that will be extended with additional&#13;
bays. A 132 KV line will interconnect the existing Olkaria I plant through a 220/132 KV, 80 MVA&#13;
autotransformer with the substation at Olkaria I. Both 132 and 220 KV lines will be strung with Canary&#13;
ACSR conductors with one conductor per phase giving a rating of 282 MVA per phase at 220 KV. Steel&#13;
lettice towers will be used with vertical configuration for the double circuit 220 KV lines and with&#13;
triangular configuration for the single circuit 132 KV lines. The substations will be constructed as double&#13;
busbar with one-and-a-third circuit-breaker configuration. Circuit Breakers will be of the SF6 or minimum&#13;
oil type.&#13;

Olkaria III Geothermal Power Plant&#13;
25.    The Olkaria III Geothermal Power Plant, to be implemented in the Olkaria Southwest sector of the&#13;
Olkaria Geothermal Field (an area of approximately 7 square kilometers), is expected to be similar to the&#13;
Olkaria 11 Geothermal Project described above'. As indicated before there are 4 productive wells and two&#13;
additional wells (wells OW-308 and OW-102) being drilled by KPC. The electrical connection to the&#13;
national grid of Olkaria III will be a simple line interconnection between the Olkaria Ill step-up substation&#13;
to the 132 KV side of the Olkaria 11 power substation.&#13;
26.    This project is being offered to independent power producers (IPP's) for development. The project&#13;
scope that would be carried out by the successful IPP include: drilling and testing of the production field&#13;
(includes reservoir engineering studies); design and construction of the power plant and the design of the&#13;
electrical interconnection to the Olkaria II substation; and finally the operation of both the well field and&#13;
the power plant to comply with the terms of a purchase power agreement that would be entered between&#13;
the IPP and KPLC.&#13;
Support for Olkaria I Geothermal Power Plant&#13;
27.    The East production field, as indicated before, supports an installed capacity of 45 MW (Olkaria&#13;
1). As is normal in all geothermal fields there is a decline of pressure and steam rate as a consequence of&#13;
exploitation of the resource; the rate of such decline depends on the specific characteristic of the field&#13;
being exploited. In the case of the Olkaria Field, the experienced decline is about 4% per year. The&#13;
production of Olkaria I, as a consequence of the indicated phenomena, decreased to 29 MW some few&#13;
years ago. Now with the connection of several make-up wells, the power output of the power station has&#13;
been restored to full capacity.&#13;
28.    The proposed "Support for Olkaria I Geothermal Power Plant Project" consists of: (a) the&#13;
connection of two additional wells (already drilled), plus (b) the drilling of four new wells, to be later&#13;
connected by KPC, using its own resources, to the gathering system of Olkaria 1, with an independent&#13;
contractor.&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
29.     The Environmental Assessment and related environmental analysis following the Bank policies&#13;
and procedures regarding EA's was carried-out by a specialized consulting firm in 1992 to provide&#13;
information on the following matters: (a) the existing environmental baseline conditions; (b) the potential&#13;
Environmental impacts, both direct and indirect; (c) the identification of preventing, mitigating and&#13;
compensating measures; (d) environmental management and training; and (e) monitoring.&#13;
30.    The environmental impacts of using geothermal energy for power generation are generally related&#13;
to impacts on: (a) air quality; (b) water pollution; (c) land disturbance; (d) aesthetics or visual impacts; (e)&#13;
noise; and (f) socio-economic aspects. The main findings of the EIA study on these aspects are summarized&#13;
as follows:&#13;
31.    Air Quality. The gaseous elements carried out by the geothermal steam are discharged to the air,&#13;
depending on the characteristics of the particular resource, problems may arise. In the case of the Olkaria&#13;
NE resource the non-condensable gases consist mainly of carbon dioxide (up to 96% of volume) and small&#13;
amounts of hydrogen sulfide (up to 5%), plus very small amounts of hydrogen, methane, and nitrogen. In&#13;
In the area assigned to Olkaria III, the field still has to be explored with additional geoscientific work&#13;
and exploratory/production drilling. The additional wells will have to be strategically located in the&#13;
field in accordance to the conceptual geothermal model. After drilling a sufficient number of wells, a&#13;
detailed reservoir engineering analysis will have to be executed to determine the generating capacity&#13;
that the reservoir in that area can support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.4&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
the Olkaria 11 power plant, these gases will be dispersed through the cooling tower plume. Modeling&#13;
calculations indicate that the dispersion obtained is good and the concentrations will be much less than&#13;
those registered with the existing Olkaria I power station.&#13;
32.    The modeling calculations also indicated that concentrations of H1S in most settlements will reach&#13;
the same levels of the current situation, except in the existing X-2 camp in which the threshold for odor&#13;
detection will be increased by 40%. For this reason it was recommended that the X-2 camp be relocated&#13;
outside the Hell's Gate National Park. This recommendation has been accepted and the cost of the&#13;
relocation has been included in the cost of the project. Moreover, it is important to note, that ground level&#13;
concentrations were found below those levels that could adversely affect the health of workers and local&#13;
population. Another minor recommendation on air quality relates to the need for continual monitoring of&#13;
the local flower growing areas.&#13;
,3.     Water Pollution. The main problem that could be derived from geothermal power stations is&#13;
related to the handling of the geothermal residual fluids. High temperature reservoirs, greater than 2300 C -&#13;
the case of Olkaria - produce waste water containing an extensive menu of dissolved minerals. The&#13;
elements of most concern are fluoride, arsenic, and lead. Although by world standards the Olkaria&#13;
geothermal brines are not particularly toxic, it does exceed health-based water quality goals and needs to be&#13;
disposed of in a safe manner. The current method of disposing of the geothermal brines into gullies and&#13;
natural drainage lines, currently practiced in the existing Olkaria I station are inappropriate since serious&#13;
erosion has been caused in some areas.&#13;
34.    In the Olkaria 11 geothermal project, as explained before, all residual waters will be reinjected into&#13;
the geothermal reservoir, using several non-productive or specially drilled reinjection wells. Reinjection&#13;
not only is an environmental sound way of disposing of the waste water but also has a positive impact on&#13;
the maintenance of reservoir pressure and steam rates over a longer period of time.&#13;
35.     Since the whole geothermal operation depends from abstraction of fresh water from neighboring&#13;
Naivasha lake, and although the amount taken by KPC is only around 3% of total abstraction, it was&#13;
however recommended that KPC monitors the lake level variation (long term).&#13;
36.    Land Disturbance. As indicated before, the geothermal development is within the Hell's Gate&#13;
National Park which present a host of animal life. In order to minimize the disturbance of the habitat there&#13;
will not be a perimeter fence around the whole complex. Only individual well heads will be fenced, and the&#13;
power house and substation will have their own perimeter fences.&#13;
37.    Where drilling operations have been completed the larger area required to accommodate the&#13;
equipment will be restored to its original state.&#13;
38.    No impacts have been experienced with the current operations of Olkaria I on the local flora. The&#13;
situation with Olkaria 11 is further improved since all waste waters will be piped instead of ditched. This&#13;
will prevent new vegetation to occur in the neighboring areas.&#13;
39.    Aesthetics or Visual Impacts. The choice of the Site A versus an alternative Site B, for the power&#13;
station was taken despite its greater visual impact. This impact will be mitigated by the construction of&#13;
embankments around the station, the planting of trees and appropriate architectural designs of the buildings&#13;
that make up the power complex.&#13;
40.    Noise. Noise measurements indicate that present drilling operations have a very low noise level in&#13;
the range of 24 to 34 DB(A). The power station operation, test drilling, and well head operations will&#13;
generate noise levels above this type of background noise detectable specially at night. The only major&#13;
impact on any residential area is in the existing X-2 camp where noise levels will be increased to about 43-&#13;
50 dB(A), during the well testing phase, but as mentioned before, the camp will be relocated. There will&#13;
also be a noise impact during the construction phase of the power station but it will be a temporary&#13;
problem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.4&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
41.    Socio-EconomicAspects. The Environmental Assessment concluded that the project would have&#13;
a significant impact on the socio economic of the surroundings. It was considered necessary that KPC&#13;
provides all necessary accommodation and infrastructure because the local towns would not be able to&#13;
accommodate the workforce during construction and later during the operation of the station.&#13;
42.    The long term impact on tourism was not considered a major problem. Indeed many tourist&#13;
considered such a development and attraction rather than a detraction.&#13;
43.    The recommendations of the Environmental Impact Assessment were incorporated in the&#13;
..Agreement on Geothermal Development in Hell's Gate and Longonot National Parks" entered between&#13;
the Kenya Wildlife Service and The Kenya Power Company LTD on September 20, 1994. All activities are&#13;
now executed under the terms of the Agreement. However, still pending is the relocation of the existing&#13;
camp X-2 outside the boundaries of the park.2 The cost of this relocation are included to be financed&#13;
within the Energy Sector Investment Project. The architectural and civil engineering designs for the&#13;
Olkaria 1I residences have been adopted for the new X-2 camp.&#13;
Implementation of the Geothermal Components&#13;
44.    Organization. The geothermal components will be implemented by KPC (generation); the&#13;
transmission and substations financed with Olkaria II will be implemented under the supervision of KPLC&#13;
(transmission and distribution). For Olkaria [I a project management team will established under the&#13;
Geothermal Development Coordinator, who reports to the Chief Project Development Manager. The&#13;
project management team will use the services of the existing units of the Office of the Geothermal&#13;
Coordinator, namely, the Procurement Unit and the Project Procurement, Monitoring and Control Unit.&#13;
Through the Office of the Chief Project Development Manager, the project management team obtains the&#13;
services of the Finance Department for matters relating to disbursement and payments to contractors and&#13;
consultants&#13;
45.    For the implementation of the Olkaria 11 project, a Consultant Firm will be contracted. This firm&#13;
selected among a short list firms, previously approved by IDA, will assist KPC during the bidding process&#13;
as well as for supervision of construction which includes factory inspection, as-built designs and the testing&#13;
and commissioning of the power plant. The Operation Division of KPC will assigned three engineers to&#13;
work with the consulting firm in field supervision of construction and assembly of power plant equipment&#13;
46.    The Implementation Schedule of Olkaria 1I shows that the project requires 39 months or 3 114&#13;
years of execution after the eligibility of the loan and/or the tendering process are initiated. The critical&#13;
path of execution is conformed principally by the contracting and manufacturing of the electromechanical&#13;
equipment, interrelated with the civil works. Because of this fact, project management and engineering is&#13;
critical in assuring that the contractors for the civil works contract and the electromechanical equipment&#13;
contractor do not interfere with the schedule of the other.&#13;
47.    The Implementation Schedule of Olkaria 111, if negotiation with the private sector are successful,&#13;
considers that it will be executed in parallel and during the same period of time as Olkaria 11.&#13;
48.    The relocation of the X-2 camp will required three years and half. One year for contracting and&#13;
engineer/Architect firm to prepare the studies and designs, and the remaining two and half in the&#13;
contracting and construction of the works.&#13;
B.     Distribution Systems Reinforcement&#13;
2   Another important requirement is the reinjection of the residual waters from both the field and the&#13;
cooling system. This however will be implemented during the construction of the power plant and the&#13;
gathering system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

49.    KPLC intends to carry out a program to reinforce primary distribution (subtransmission) in&#13;
Nairobi and in the Coastal Area, particularly around Mombassa. The program in Nairobi would essentially&#13;
complete the 66 kV ring around the city and expand the 66/11 kV substation capacity feeding into the II&#13;
kV feeders network.&#13;
50.    Nairobi. The Nairobi System receives power at 132 kV and 220 kV from Juja Road, Ruaraka and&#13;
Embakasi substations all located on the outskirts of the city. Transfornation to the primary distribution&#13;
voltage of 66 kV is done presently at these three substation. Fifteen 66/11 kV primary distribution&#13;
substations are located in and around Nairobi.&#13;
51.    The method used to forecast demand was developed by KPLC consultants and used in the&#13;
National Power Development Plan. This method relates energy sales for various categories of consumers&#13;
to the related sectorial GDPs, historical sales and projected tariff increases. By imputing the Nairobi area&#13;
sales figures and the national economic data up to 1994, and the projected GDP growth rates for future&#13;
years, the area total sales and peak demand were forecasted. From peak demands forecast, the annual&#13;
growth rate for the total area load is obtained. The calculated growth rate is then applied to all the&#13;
individual substation loads with appropriate adjustments.&#13;
52.    Reinforcement required for each of the existing substations was determined on the basis of having&#13;
a firm transformer capacity available at each substation, i.e. transformer capacity sufficient minus one&#13;
transformer to accommodate the expected load. Location and capacity of new substations was also&#13;
determined, as well as reinforcement or new 66 kV lines. A number of arrangements for the 66 kV grid&#13;
were then compared on the basis of their benefit/cost ratio. The increase in grid capacity is costed at the&#13;
Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) attributable to HV and MV reinforcements. The LRMC in this case has&#13;
been calculated by KPLC's consultants at USSO.O18 per kWh.&#13;
53.    Within the selected option for reinforcement of the Nairobi Grid, the program for the period&#13;
1996/97-2000/01 consist of the following works:&#13;
*   Limuru 66/11 kV Substation, install 2 x 15 MVA transformers;&#13;
*   Kikuyu 66/11 kV Substation; install second 10 MVA transformer;&#13;
*   Parkland 66/11 kV Substation; install 2 x 45 transformers;&#13;
*   Juja-Parkland 66/kV line; reconductor of 2x6.5 km;&#13;
*   Embakasi - Nairobi West 66 kV line; reconductor of 2x3 km;&#13;
*   Juja - Jeevanjee/Bahati 66/kV line, construct 1.0 km of double circuit line;&#13;
-   Parklands-Catedral 66 kV cable, install 2.5 km of cable;&#13;
*   Nairobi West - Karen - Kileleshwa 66 kV line, construct 5.5 km of line;&#13;
*   Bahati 66/11 kV Substation; establish new substation with 2x23 MVA transformers; and&#13;
*   Kileshwa 66/11 kV Substation; establish new substations with 2x23 MVA transformers.&#13;
54.    Coastal Area. The study for the reinforcement of the 33 kV and 132 kV primary distribution grid&#13;
in the Coastal Area, was carried out by KPLC using the same approach as for Nairobi. The reinforcement&#13;
program thus established for the period 1996/97-2000/01 comprises the following works:&#13;
*   Nyali 33/11 kV Substation, install 23 MVA transformer;&#13;
*   Gede 33/11 kV Substation, install second 7.5 MVA transformer;&#13;
*   Miritini 33/11 kV Substation, install second 7.5 MVA transformer;&#13;
*   KPR 33/11 kV Substation; install second 7.5 MVA transformer;&#13;
*   Kipevu 132/33/11 kV Substation; install 23 MVA transformer;&#13;
*   Diani 33/11 kV Substation; install 23 MVA transformer;&#13;
*   Rabai-Diani 132 kV line; construct 45 km and install 45 MVA Substation;&#13;
*   Likoni 33/11 kV Substation; install 2.5 MVA transformer;&#13;
*   Kipevu 132/33/11 kV Substation; install second 23 MVA transformer; and&#13;
*  Shanzu 33/11 kV Substation; install 23 MVA transformer.&#13;
55.    Equipment already in stock, mainly transformers, represents about US$12 million. Some shifting&#13;
of transformers between substations would also be done.&#13;

KENYA&#13;
Description of the Resource Assessment Component&#13;
I.     The 1992 updated National Power Development Plan prepared by Acres International recommends the&#13;
addition of about 493 MW of geothermal power capacity up to the year 2011'. The corresponding least-cost&#13;
Development Plan requires that two units of 32 MW (units # 6 &amp; 7) come in line by the year 2001, and another two&#13;
units (units # 8 &amp; 9). of the same capacity, by year 20032. To achieve these ambitious long and short term&#13;
objectives, requires a continuous program of surface investigations, drilling and well field development, along with&#13;
the design, financing, tendering and construction of power plants. The Geothermal Resource Assessment Program&#13;
included in the "Energy Sector Investment Project" can be subdivided in two sub-components, as follows: (a) Field&#13;
Development and Feasibility/Detailed Design for Olkaria IV or Olkaria III &amp; IV, and (b) Advanced Pre-feasibility&#13;
Studies at Olkaria Domes and Suswa, and Pre-feasibility Studies at Longonot and a New Area. The descriptions of&#13;
these components follow:&#13;
A.     Field Development and Feasibility/Detail Designs for Olkaria IV or Olkaria III &amp; IV&#13;
2.     The Field Development Activities proposed, within the Geothermal Resource Assessment Program, were&#13;
established to comply with the stated objectives of the National Power Development Plan and the "normal&#13;
geothermal development criteria " followed by the geothermal industry in other developing countries.3&#13;
3.     The proposed Base Field Development Program considers the drilling of 26 wells. This does not comply&#13;
strictly with the described "normal development criteria", since under normal circumstances only 11 wells would&#13;
have been required to prove the feasibility of the Olkaria IV geothermal project. The departure from the normal&#13;
practice is justified with the following considerations: (a) the need to develop the field of the next geothermal power&#13;
plant (Olkaria IV) to ensure its implementation by year 2003; and, more importantly, (b) the need to establish an&#13;
Alternative Program - with the same cost as the Base Program - as a back-up, in case that negotiations with the&#13;
private sector for Olkaria III are not successful; in this instance, the Govemment of Kenya will be confronted with&#13;
the need to prove feasibility for the two projects to secure their financing and implementation.&#13;
4.     With the proposed Altemative Program, 11 wells will be drilled in each of the two areas assigned for the&#13;
Olkaria Ill and IV geothermal projects - a total of 22 wells - plus the preparation of the feasibility level studies and&#13;
designs of the corresponding power plants. The Alternative Program thus established follows strictly the described&#13;
"normal geothermal development criteria" followed by other geothermal developing countries.&#13;
B.      Advanced Pre-Feasibility Studies at Olkaria Domes and Suswa, and Pre-Feasibility Studies at&#13;
Longonot and a New Area&#13;
I The probable generating capacity that can be supported by the geothermal resources of the country still has to be&#13;
demonstrated.&#13;
2 Due to the delays incurred in funding the current Program it is doubtful that these additional units can be&#13;
commissioned by the indicated years.&#13;
3 Following common practice or "Normal Process" ,the geothermal fields are developed to a level of 30% of the&#13;
steam required for full production of a given generating capacity, and, utilizing the geoscientific data of the&#13;
drilling campaign, the surface geoscientific studies are upgraded, thus obtaining an improved geothermal&#13;
conceptual model and a detail synthesis map of the geoscientific anomalies. The studies related to the&#13;
geothermal field, complemented with reservoir engineering studies and power plant and gathering systems&#13;
feasibility level designs - including cost estimates - constitute a feasibility report adequate for seeking the&#13;
financing for the implementation of the project. The detail designs (tender level designs) are prepared during&#13;
the year in which the financing is sought and negotiated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.5&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
5.      Surface exploration will be concluded in Olkaria Domes and Suswa and in the areas of Longonot and in&#13;
some new area in the north (probably Menengai) with KPC own resources. A slim-hole drilling Program will be&#13;
carried out in Olkaria Domes and Suswa. It includes the drilling, in each of the indicated areas of six temperature&#13;
gradient holes (500 meters depth), and 3 deep (2,500 meters) slim holes. These drilling activities will be done with a&#13;
drilling contractor.&#13;
6.      To support KPC scientific geothermal activities, it was agreed to include as part of this component, the&#13;
financing of an Advisory Board integrated by six recognized international geothermal experts. The respective&#13;
specialization of the six experts will be as follows: (i ) geothermal exploration in the discipline of geology&#13;
volcanology: (ii) geothermal exploration in the discipline of geochemistry and geophysics, (iii) geothermal field&#13;
development. which includes drilling engineering, well test and reservoir engineering; (iv) geothermal plant design&#13;
and installation, which includes mechanical, chemical, electrical and construction engineering; (v) management and&#13;
operations of geothermal projects, which includes project planning, production engineering, financing and financial&#13;
control, and (vi ) environmental science, which includes hydrology, meteorology, biology and sustainable&#13;
development&#13;
7.      To support KPC drilling operations, the project would include the financing of the purchase of equipment&#13;
(vehicles, tractors, scientific instruments, drilling equipment spare parts, excavation equipment, well testing&#13;
equipment). drilling services and repairs, training and the preparation of feasibility and other geothermal studies,&#13;
and the contracting of drilling services.&#13;
8.      KPC with its own resources will purchase local materials and services as spares, environmental materials&#13;
(trees, plants. etc.), water supply system maintenance (spare and services), water pipeline for drilling operations,&#13;
and land acquisitions.&#13;
Implementation&#13;
9.      Organization. The Advance Pre-feasibility level studies, and Field Development Program for additional&#13;
units in the Olkaria Geothermal Field, included in the Resource Geothermal Assessment Program, will be carried&#13;
out by the Geothermal Development Manager's Office at Olkaria. This Office has under its supervision the Team of&#13;
Geoscientists and the Drilling Crew Operations, who will supervise the slim drilling operations that will be&#13;
contracted with a private drilling company. The Geothermal Development Manager reports to the Geothermal&#13;
Development Coordinator. As support for the indicated studies, an Advisory Board integrated by six recognized&#13;
geothermal experts in the different disciplines that enter into the studies of a Geothermal Project, will assist KPC in&#13;
all areas of the Geothermal Program of the Project, but especially in the Resource Assessment and Field&#13;
Development Areas. The Advisory Board will review the studies and reports prepared by KPC Geoscientists. The&#13;
recommendations of the Advisory Board agreed during the Advisory Board meetings will be mandatory&#13;
10.    A geothermal consultant firm or firms, following IDA's procedures, will be contracted for carrying out the&#13;
feasibility level studies that will be completed, after a pre-approved number of commercial diameter wells have&#13;
been drilled4. The supervision of feasibility level studies fall under the leadership of the Office of the Corporate&#13;
Planning Manager. This Office will have the support on geothermal matters of the Offices of the Coordinator of&#13;
Geothermal Development and the Staff of Scientists of the Geothermal Development Manager, and of the Advisory&#13;
Board of international experts. All described arrangements are considered satisfactory for the implementation of the&#13;
geothermal components of the Energy Sector Investment Project.&#13;
I1.    Implementation Schedules. In accordance to the Implementation Schedules the Geothermal Program&#13;
requires four year years for its execution and four and half year for loan disbursements, after the loans are declare&#13;
effective. The most important aspects of the Implementation Schedules are summarized as follows:&#13;
4These wells will be drilled by KPC 's drilling crew, utilizing an existing drilling rig which will be overhauled with&#13;
resources of the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.5&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
12.    The Implementation for "Support of Olkaria I" and the "Geothermal Resource Assessment" can be&#13;
grouped as a single program of procurement of services, materials and equipment/instruments. The procurement&#13;
activities of this group have been divided in two round of activities, the first round covers the needs of&#13;
materials/equipment and services for approximately II wells for 2 years. The second round for the remaining two&#13;
years. Under this group the development drilling for Olkaria IV or III and IV and the feasibility studies of these&#13;
projects will be concluded in the indicated four years: the Pre-feasibility level studies of the other geothermal areas&#13;
are also concluded during the fourth year of activities.&#13;

ENERGY SECTOR REFORM AND POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
RURAL &amp; HOUSEHOLD ENERGY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY&#13;
Introduction&#13;
Woodfuel and agricultural residues are estimated to account for about 75 percent of the total primary&#13;
energy use. According to the most recent bousehold energy use survey, which was carried out in 1980. about&#13;
95 percent of the domestic sector's energy demand was met bv firewood, charcoal and residues. During the&#13;
1980's a number of bilaterally funded household energy activities have been implemented, including the&#13;
development of efficient cooking stoves, agroforestry, and biogas and wind energy development. Currently,&#13;
however, no reliable data exists of the woodfuel demand and supply situation, or of the impact of the activities&#13;
in the sub-sector. The Government, therefore, has decided to develop a Rural and Household Energy Strategy&#13;
to accelerate the access to sustainable and affordable energy by lower income rural and urban households.&#13;
Objective&#13;
The objective of this activity is to develop a Rural and Household Energy Strategy, including a&#13;
priority investment and technical assistance program to efficiently address the energy related problems of&#13;
medium and low income households.&#13;
Activity Description&#13;
Tbe project comprises the following three sb- o . (i) Housebold Energy Use Survey; (ii)&#13;
Energy Supply and Marketing Study; and (iii) Policy, Institutional and Pricing Study.&#13;
Household Fnergy Use Survey&#13;
Objective. TMe objective of the Household Energ Use Survey is to obtain data of energy use in&#13;
households. The survey will target medium and low imcome households in rural and urban areas.&#13;
Specifically, the survey will estabih te types of energy used (firewood, charcoal, agricultural residues,&#13;
kerosene, LPG, electicity, solar, etc.), quandties used, type of end-use by fuel, sasonal variatios in fuel&#13;
use and fuel availability, equmet used, houehold's ener  expenditure, whether fuel is purchased or&#13;
collected free of charge, where uel is purcsed ad collected, supply constains and other problems&#13;
encountered by the households relaed to tei enerV use (health, envirounme). The uv  will also seek to&#13;
obtain information of households enery cosrvation awazeu, use of energU efficiet equipment, and&#13;
reasons for not usig energy effint equipmt. In addition, the survey will obtain informaton of household&#13;
attitudes toward fuel swihing and how the hoseolds perceive the availability of alternative fuels and their&#13;
possibilities to switch to alternative fuels.&#13;
Saple and Survey Mehod. About 100 bouseholds will be interviewed in 10-15 districts and 3-5&#13;
urban centers in order to identify differences between urban and rural households and between different&#13;
ecological areas.&#13;
Energ F S=p, and Makting Sr&#13;
Objecnve. The objective of the Energy Supply and Marketing Survey is to establish the seasonal&#13;
availability of fuelwood and modern fuels in the areas of the household surveys, the origin of firewood and&#13;
charcoal supplies, the fuel supply chai, nd prices. The survey also aims to establish changes in fuel&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

consumption and availability over the past years. The study will build on the existing data, for instance the&#13;
Kenya Forestry Master Plan.&#13;
Survex Method. Interviews with fuelwood vendors, petroleum products distributors, forestry&#13;
officials, NGOs, and others. The interviews will be conducted in parallel with the Household Energy Use&#13;
Survey. A sample of the areas will be selected for a second survey to caprure seasonal availabiliny of fuel&#13;
more accurately.&#13;
Policy. Istitutignal and Pricing Stidy&#13;
Objective. The objecti-ve of the Policy, Institutional and Pricing Study is to: (i) identify and evaluate&#13;
the policies that influence the household energy sub-sector today; (ii) identify barriers to energy conservation&#13;
and fuel switching; (iii) evaluate the impact of the policy reforms in the petroleum and power sub-sectors on&#13;
the household energy sub-sector; (iv) how can markets be tapped in such a way to encourage a shift from&#13;
non-sustainable, mostly land clearance operations to sustainable tree growing or forest/woodland management&#13;
initiatives; (v) propose changes in the policy, and pricing frameworks to promote sustainable and affordable&#13;
energy supplies to medium and low income households (including energy conservation and fuel substitution),&#13;
and (vi) assess the capacity of the various institutions (GOK, NGOs, private sector) to address household&#13;
energy issues effectively and propose improvements as required. The study will also evaluate the impact of&#13;
the past activities in the household energy sub-sector (both supply and demand side).&#13;
The study will result in the development of a strategy for implementing the proposed policy reforms,&#13;
and in outlining investment and technical assistance programs.&#13;
Implementation Armngements&#13;
The Ministry of Energy will have the implemenation responsibility. The samplng, interviews,&#13;
coding of responses, quality control of responses, computerization of responses, and production of results will&#13;
be carried out by consultantts and the Central Bure;..i of Stistics. An international household energy&#13;
expert(s) will be engaged to asist MOE and CBS m project design, questonnaire design, sampling;&#13;
enumerator training; repordng; and to cary out the Policy, Instiuonal &amp;ad Pricing Study.&#13;

Implementation Support Plan and Staff Input&#13;
1.     The Borrower's supervision activities would be carried out by the Ministry of Energy (MOE), Kenya Power and Lighting&#13;
Company (KPLC), and Kenya Power Company (KPC). Their supervisory functions would involve the following:&#13;
(a)    initial review, recording and forwarding of:&#13;
(i)    all procurement orders&#13;
(ii)    all disbursement requests&#13;
(iii)   special accounts expenditures/reimbursements&#13;
(b)    preparation of an annual project implementation budget&#13;
(c)    preparation of bidding and other project contract documents&#13;
(d)    preparation of monthly financial statements&#13;
(e)    preparation of semi-annual progress reports to IDA in December and June of each year on all aspects of project&#13;
implementation&#13;
(f)    preparation of annual project accounts&#13;
(g)    monitor key performance indicators and environmental mitigation plans&#13;
(h)    arranging for the annual audits of project accounts and SOEs&#13;
(i)    liaising with all Bank supervision missions&#13;
2.     In addition to the regular implementation support missions to be carried out by IDA in accordance with the schedule set out&#13;
below, IDA staff would spend time on dealing with correspondence, reviewing and commenting on procurement documents,&#13;
disbursement requests, half-yearly reports and audited accounts. The amount of time estimated is as follows:&#13;
HQ Time        Field Time     Total Time&#13;
Project Year 1         8 sws          36 sws         44 sws&#13;
Project Year 2         8 sws          36 sws         44 sws&#13;
Project Year 3         7 sws          39 sws         39 sws&#13;

3.     Mid-term Review by the Borrower and IDA would be held not later than June 30, 2000. The terms of reference and&#13;
background papers for the review would be prepared by the Ministry of Energy and the implementing agencies with IDA staff&#13;
assistance as may be necessary. The principal objective of the implementation review would be to examine the status of&#13;
implementation of the project, determine any required changes in design and implementation arrangements needed to ensure&#13;
achievement of the project's development objectives. Specifically, the review meetings will focus on the status of progress in: (i)&#13;
adjustment of tariffs towards LRMC; (ii) attracting private sector participation; (iii) restructuring of organization of the power&#13;
subsector; and (iv) the operation of the Electricity Regulatory Board.&#13;

Energy Sector Reform and Power Development Project&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
Assumptions&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
Incremental Electricity Sales The benefits from incremental electricity sales are defined as the difference&#13;
between the demand which the system can satisfy with the proposed investments and that it can satisfy&#13;
without the proposed investments. It is assumed that these benefits will increase as demand rises, until&#13;
2013 when they will reach a plateau at the maximum generation capability of the new generation facilities.&#13;
Thereafter, the benefits will remain constant through 2020, the remaining economic life of the diesel and&#13;
geothermal facilities. The analysis has taken account of the longer economic life of the hydro plant and the&#13;
transmission and distribution facilities through residual values. For the valuation of incremental sales in&#13;
GWh, the analysis used a rate of US 14 cents per kWh, which is the estimated average consumers'&#13;
willingness to pay for electricity.&#13;
Estimation of Consumer Surplus and Consumers' Willingness-to-Pay for Electricity The analysis&#13;
estimated the consumer's willingness-to-pay (WTP) for electricity using estimated demand functions for&#13;
different consumer categories. The demand functions are defined by two points: The "lower" end of the&#13;
demand functions is represented the price-quantity pair denoting the quantity of electricity consumed at&#13;
KPLC's marginal tariff rates for different consumers. The "upper" end of the demand functions is defined&#13;
as the upper end of the function representing consumers willingness to pay for higher valued uses of&#13;
electricity (such as lighting); this point is represented by the price-quantity pair of alternative energy&#13;
sources to KPLC provided electricity, in kWh equivalents. For households and small commercial&#13;
consumers the alternative is generally kerosene for lighting. Survey data on households' kerosene&#13;
consumption and fuel price data were used to establish the kWh consumption that would yield the&#13;
equivalent amount of lighting prior to the availability of electricity; and to convert the cost of kerosene&#13;
lighting to an equivalent cost per kWh. For industries the alternative is captive diesel generators and data&#13;
on equipment, maintenance and fuel costs were used to estimate the kWh equivalent costs. The average&#13;
willingness to pay by consumer category is calculated as the average of the costs associated with the lower&#13;
and upper ends of the estimated demand function. The detailed calculations in Annex 7.3 show that the&#13;
average WTP, in mid- 1995, ranged from US cents 13 per kWh to US cents 18 per kWh. As of October&#13;
1996, KPLC's marginal tariff rates vary from 2.5 to 10.5 US cents per kWh. KPLC's average tariff is US&#13;
cents 9.1 per kWh. This implies an average consumer surplus of about 4.9 US cents per kWh.&#13;
Fuel Cost Savings These savings accrue from the improved efficiency of the new diesel plants, and the&#13;
substitution of gas oil and kerosene for lower cost fuel oil, that will cut the average cost of fuel per kWh.&#13;
B. Economic Costs&#13;
General All costs are incremental as compared to the "without the project" case, in which none of the&#13;
investments would have been made. They are expressed in mid-1995 prices net of taxes and duties.&#13;
Investment costs include on average about 6 percent physical contingencies. The local currency&#13;
component, which is wages to skilled and semi-skilled labor and materials, is about 24 percent of total&#13;
investment cost. The analysis used a general conversion factor 0.9 used to convert the local costs from&#13;
market prices to economic prices.&#13;
Capital Costs of New Electricity Generating Units The unit cost for thermal generating facilities per kW&#13;
of installed capacity are as follows: Hydro: US$ 2,240; medium-speed diesel units: US$ 1,100; and&#13;
geothermal plants: $2,200-2,300.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7.2&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
Fuel Costs The analysis uses border parity prices to define the economic cost of fuel used in power&#13;
generation. The forecast border parity prices are derived from the World Bank's forecast of crude oil&#13;
prices, as of August 1996, taking account of refining margins, freight, insurance, handling, and transport&#13;
to project site. The World Bank forecasts a declining trend in real crude oil prices.&#13;
Annual Operating and Maintenance Costs&#13;
Hydro plant:                  1.5% of investment cost Existing Geothermal plant:158 per kWh&#13;
New diesel plant fixed:       $20 per kW             New Geothermal plant:  $57 per kWh&#13;
New diesel plant variable:    $0.0105 per kWh        Existing steam plant fixed: $37-44 per kW&#13;
Existing steam plant variable:  $0.0038-0.0044/kWh    Existing gas turbine fixed: $17-25 per kW&#13;
Existing gas turbine variable:  $0.0081-0.0088/kWh&#13;
Transmission:                 2% of cumulative investment cost&#13;
Distribution:                 3.5% of cumulative investment cost&#13;
Incremental consumer cost (billing etc.):   $0.003 per kWh&#13;

generate a self financing of 22 percent. Further increases to&#13;
cover full LRMC will be based on a Tariff Study to be&#13;
completed by November 1997.&#13;
Nature of benefits:                   Supply of forecast electricity demand, fuel cost savings,&#13;

Quantitative Risk Analysis&#13;
1.     The main risks of this Project relate to three factors: (i) the uncertainties associated with the&#13;
macroeconomic environment, which could affect consumer demand for electricity, and consequently,&#13;
output from the project facilities; (ii) possible delays in the commissioning of the generation facilities; and&#13;
(iii) the value of benefits. In addition, uncertainties related to the costs of equipment and installation could&#13;
also affect the project's net benefits, though not in the same extent as those associated with the demand&#13;
forecast or the value of benefits. The project is also subject to risks which cannot be hedged in project&#13;
design. These include risks associated with hydrology which will affect the output quantity from the&#13;
project facilities. They also include the impact of international petroleum prices.&#13;
2.     A quantitative risk analysis was carried out to asses the impact on the project's economic returns&#13;
of uncertainty in underlying assumptions and predictions. The primary risks affecting the project's&#13;
economic outcome and the probability distribution to be assigned to each of them were defined based on&#13;
the project team's estimates. The stochastic nature of the project implementation was subsequently&#13;
modeled using a commercially available risk analysis program. The expected rate of return and NPV -&#13;
with their probability distributions - were determined using a Monte Carlo process with a Latin Hybercube&#13;
sampling technique in the simulation of the model. The major project risks and the probability&#13;
distributions assigned to each of the risk variables are discussed below.&#13;
*      Electricity demandforecast. The electricity demand forecast has a major impact on the project's&#13;
economic viability. A triangular distribution with minimum, most likely and maximum values was&#13;
assigned to the average annual demand growth rates. The forecast prepared by KPLC and confirmed by&#13;
Acres International Ltd. was used as the most likely outcome. It predicts an average annual growth of&#13;
some 5.6 percent based on the expected GDP growth rate of 5.5 percent. The Bank's economic forecast&#13;
provides three development scenarios: the low growth scenario assumes an average annual GDP growth&#13;
rate of about 3.2 percent, the high scenario about 7 percent, while the average growth rate is estimated at&#13;
about 5.5 percent. To represent the uncertainty in the economic growth rates in the electricity demand&#13;
forecast, the GDP growth rates were translated into average demand growth rates using the GDP to&#13;
electricity demand elasticity. The observed average elasticity for the period 1988-1992 was about 2.&#13;
Given, however, that the tariffs have (and will) go up and tnat efficiency measures will be introduced, the&#13;
elasticity is assumed at I in this analysis in line with that used in the demand forecast. This gives the&#13;
minimum and maximum annual growth rates of 3.2 percent, and 7 percent respectively. The resulting&#13;
distribution is skewed towards the low side, that is, the probability for low demand growth exceeds the&#13;
probability for high growth.&#13;
*      Consumers' Willingness to Pay. The value assigned to consumers willingness to pay will&#13;
determine the value of the benefits. A triangular distribution was selected with the average value being the&#13;
estimated US$ 0.14 per kWh and the maximum and minimum values defined as US$0.16 and US$0.08,&#13;
respectively. The minimum value coincides with KPLC's current average tariff. The resulting distribution&#13;
is negatively skewed, i.e., the probability for low values is greater than the probability for high values.&#13;
*      Commissioning dates for project facilities. The commissioning of the generation facilities is&#13;
expected to follow the least-cost investment schedule, where the first facility, Kipevu 1, would be&#13;
commissioned in 1999, and the two final plants, Sondu Miriu and the Olkaria II in 2001. In case the&#13;
construction of some or all of the facilities is delayed, project benefits would decline and the economy&#13;
would have to bear an additional cost of not having electricity available. Since the Project includes both&#13;
publicly and privately fnanced facilities and they are at different levels of preparedness, it is expected that&#13;
the probability of delay varies from plant to plant. For the publicly financed projects, bidding documents&#13;
have already been prepared so the bidding process could start as soon as the project becomes effective. In&#13;
this case, the main cause of delay in commissioning would be delays in the construction process. However,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7.4&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
KPC's track record in project implementation is fairly good, so the risk of delay in Kipevu I and Olkaria II&#13;
are considered relatively low. For Sondu Miriu, the risk is higher because of the civil works involved.&#13;
With respect to Gitaru, the risk of delay is related to the ability of KPC to generate the required financing&#13;
internally. For the privately financed facilities, bidding document were issued in July 1996, however, there&#13;
is the possibility that the selection process and negotiations could drag. An additional cause of delays&#13;
could be the lapse in implementing tariff increases, resulting in insufficient counterpart funding. The&#13;
following probabilities were assigned for delays in the six generation facilities:&#13;
Kipevu 1:             one year delay            10 %&#13;
Kipevu II (IPP):      one year delay            80 %&#13;
two year delay           70 %&#13;
three year delay         50 %&#13;
Olkaria II:           one year delay            20 %&#13;
Olkaria III (IPP):    one year delay            80%&#13;
two year delay           70%&#13;
three year delay         50%&#13;
Sondu Miriu           one year delay            40%&#13;
Gitaru 3rd unit:      one year delay            50%&#13;
*      Hydrology. The annual hydrology determines the output from the hydroelectric plants. As the&#13;
project would finance both hydro and thermal plants, dry hydrological conditions would mean lower output&#13;
from Sondu Miriu and Gitaru and increased use of thermal generation resulting in higher generation cost.&#13;
Wet hydrological conditions would mean less need for the thermal plants and maximum output Sondu&#13;
Miriu and Gitaru. A triangular distribution representing minimum, most likely and maximum values was&#13;
assigned to the annual hydro output based on results from system simulations.&#13;
*      Project investment cosL The capital equipment of the project comprise, to a large extent, standard&#13;
equipment and the required civil works are not excessive indicating a moderate risk of cost variations. The&#13;
civil works include tunneling work for Sondu Miriu, erection of power houses for the Geothermal plants,&#13;
installation of the modular geothermal plants, steam gathering and transmission systems, and the erection&#13;
of a new power house for the Kipevu plants, and installation of the Kipevu and Gitaru units. Poor&#13;
procurement and supervision performance by the implementing agencies or certain Government actions&#13;
could, however, cause cost increases. Cost savings are also possible owing to favorable conditions and&#13;
strict cost-control from the side of the private investors. To represent the risk associated with the cost&#13;
estimates, the analysis assigned a triangular distribution to this variable with the minimum and maximum&#13;
values established at, minus 25 percent and plus 25 percent respectively of the estimated value, i.e., total&#13;
investment costs would vary in the range of US$695 - US$1,160 million&#13;
*      Petroleum products prices. The analysis assigned a triangular distribution to the petroleum price&#13;
forecast. The likeliest annual prices were derived from the Bank's crude oil price forecast of August 1996,&#13;
which predicts a decrease in real crude oil prices: from about US$ 18 per barrel in 1996 to US$ 15 per&#13;
barrel in 2005 (in 1995 prices). The minimum and maximum values were established on either side of the&#13;
likeliest values as plus or minus 1.96 times the standard deviations provided in the Bank's forecast. The&#13;
international prices were adjusted for border parity prices adding the economic cost of transportation and&#13;
handling to the FOB prices. Based on historical data, oil prices do not to vary fully randomly from one&#13;
year to another, rather, they tend to be sticky, except for major events such as the Gulf War that caused a&#13;
temporary, steep increase. A rank-order correlation coefficient of 0.8 reflects the positive correlation&#13;
between the annual prices.&#13;

probability for an ERR of 15.5 percent or more. The expected ERR from the risk analysis is less than that&#13;
from the deterministic evaluation because the probability distribution for the main variables affecting&#13;
project benefits - electricity demand forecast and willingness to pay - are negatively skewed.&#13;

4.          Figure 2. below, displays the project's expected NPV (at 12%) and shows that the probability of a&#13;
positive NPV is about 80%. There is, therefore, a 20% probability that the project would have a negative&#13;
NPV. Lower than expected electricity sales, significant delay in the commissioning of the facilities and&#13;
lower than expected willingness to pay would contribute to the negative NPV.&#13;

Risk Management&#13;
5.     The risk analysis indicated that the probability of a negative NPV is not significant. However,&#13;
project design and implementation were formulated to mitigate the risks leading to unfavorable outcomes.&#13;
With respect to deteriorating economic performance which could lead to lower than forecast demand for&#13;
electricity - the Bank's continued broad policy dialogue on the macroeconomic reform program, will help&#13;
focusing the Government's macroeconomic reforms on maintaining stability. This includes the tightening&#13;
of fiscal policies to attract inflows of external assistance to spur economic activity.&#13;
6.     The risk associated with delays in the commissioning of facilities has been reduced for the&#13;
publicly financed projects by preparing the bidding documents well in advance, so that the bidding process&#13;
can start as soon as the project becomes effective. Previous experience suggests that KPC is fairly good in&#13;
implementing publicly financed generation projects. Nevertheless, given the large size of the Project, the&#13;
Project will provide consultant and advisory services for project implementation, engineering and financial&#13;
management to complement KPC's capacity. For the privately financed, IPP, projects, the risk of delays&#13;
has been partially reduced, through financing under the Project Preparation Facility for consultant services&#13;
for the preparation of the bidding documents, which is currently ongoing. The ultimate success will&#13;
depend on how attractive Kenya's energy sector is for private investors. The agreed changes in the legal&#13;
and regulatory framework should contribute to increasing investor confidence. Another risk is delay in&#13;
mobilizing the corresponding local financing requirements, which could lead to implementation delays.&#13;
The agreement on annual reviews of the investment program and related financing plans, as well as the&#13;
requirement to meet at least 30% of investment needs is designed to minimize this risk. Regarding the&#13;
potential lack of counterpart funding as a result of delays in implementing tariff adjustments, the agreement&#13;
on adequate tariff adjustments based on a tariff study, is designed to mitigate lapses. The tariff policy will&#13;
also be monitored in the context of IDA's continued macroeconomic dialogue.&#13;
7.     The capital equipment of the project comprise mainly of standard equipment and the civil works&#13;
are not significant, indicating a moderate risk of cost increases. These risks are counterbalanced by&#13;
including adequate contingencies in the cost estimates.&#13;

            Kenya - Energy Sector Reform and Power
            Development Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Energy Sector Reform and Power
            Development Project's objectives are to assist the
            Government of Kenya (GoK) in formulating and implementing
            major policy and institutional reforms aimed at creating an
            efficient and environmentally sustainable energy sector and
            to support investments needed to meet power demand and
            increase operational efficiency. The project's specific
            objectives are to: 1) finance investments needed to meet
            power demand and improve the operational efficiency in the
            sub-sector; 2) reform the organizational structure of the
            power sub-sector to enable the operating entities to
            function efficiently and on a commercially sustainable
            basis; 3) create a legal and regulatory environment
            necessary for private sector participation in the supply of
            electricity; 4) support GoK's adoption of economic
            pricing of both electricity and petroleum products and
            implementation of demand and supply-side efficiency
            improvement measures; and 5) develop indigenous geothermal
            energy resources and a strategy for sustainable household
            and rural energy development. The project will consist of
            the following six components: (a) sector restructuring and
            reform; (b) other institutional support; (c) efficiency
            improvements; (d) power system expansion and upgrading; (e)
            geothermal resource development; and (f) future project preparation.
