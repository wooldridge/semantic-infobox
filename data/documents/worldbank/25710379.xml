total of funds from the Trust Fund committed under all Grant Agreements that have been fully countersigned&#13;

net of the related fee.&#13;

8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿ANNEX 3&#13;
Governance&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements between the&#13;
Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
1.     Donor Committee&#13;
(a)    A Donor Committee ("DC") shall be established for the purposes of the Trust Fund, composed&#13;
of representatives of the Bank and the Donors which have committed the minimum amount of contribution to&#13;
the Trust Fund that may be required for membership on the DC as specified in the Operating Manual referred&#13;
to in Section 3 of this Annex. However, any Donor who has signed an Administration Agreement and made&#13;
its initial contribution payment, irrespective of the minimum amount of contribution to the Trust Fund, before&#13;
December 31, 2015, shall be represented on the DC.&#13;
(b)    The DC shall meet four times a year or more often as required for the purposes of: (i) providing&#13;
strategic direction and general oversight of the progress of activities supported or proposed to be supported&#13;
under the Trust Fund; (ii) deciding on the conditions for joining and the acceptance of new donors to the Trust&#13;
Fund and/or the addition or modification of any Trust Fund windows; (iii) selecting activities to be financed&#13;
from the Trust Fund, through endorsement of the six monthly rolling work plan to be prepared by the Bank,&#13;
and providing recommendations to be incorporated into subsequent work plans; and (iv) periodically reviewing&#13;
and providing feedback on reports on the progress of preparation or implementation of projects supported or&#13;
proposed to be supported under the Trust Fund in accordance with mutually agreed results frameworks, and&#13;
subject to the Bank's applicable policies and procedures on project supervision.&#13;
2.     Decision-making&#13;
(a)    Each member of the DC as specified in Section 1 of this Annex shall have equal voting rights&#13;
on the DC; provided however that Donors which have committed less than the minimum amount of&#13;
contribution to the Trust Fund that may be required for voting rights on the DC as specified in the Operating&#13;
Manual referred to in Section 3 of this Annex, may be accorded a non-voting observer status on the DC in&#13;
accordance with the Operating Manual.&#13;
(b)    Decisions of the DC shall be made by consensus of the voting members of the DC. A&#13;
consensus decision takes into account all of the proper concerns raised by each member of the DC. However,&#13;
no voting member of the DC has a veto power. When the members of the DC do not reach agreement,&#13;
discussion on the associated issue(s) continues to take the process toward consensus. If no agreement is&#13;
reached, the Bank makes the decision taking into account the views of the voting members of the DC.&#13;
3.     Operating Manual&#13;
The DC shall approve an additional manual for the operations of the DC, which shall be developed in&#13;
close consultation and by consensus among all members of the DC, and adopted by the first meeting of the&#13;
DC.&#13;
Such manual may be amended from time to time in close consultation and by consensus among all&#13;
members of the DC; provided however that in the event of any inconsistency between such manual and the&#13;
provisions of the Trust Fund Administration Agreements, the latter shall prevail.&#13;
