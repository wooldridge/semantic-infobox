&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the&#13;
World Bank's fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh&#13;
Kapur, The World Bank: Its First Hal/Century, Washington, DC: Brookings&#13;
Institution Press, 1997. It is not a formal oral history, alld it is not a systematic&#13;
overview of the work of the person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the&#13;
planned publication itself and the sources that should be consulted; at other times they&#13;
talked about persolls and publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes&#13;
and transcripts begin and end abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Ballk Group&#13;
Archives believes that this trallscript may be of interest to researchers alld makes it&#13;
available for public use.&#13;

{Begin Tape 1, Side Ai&#13;
&#13;
KING: .. seeing a taped thing is one of the most painful experiences. You say,&#13;
"What kind of thing did I actually say?" And sometimes, "Did I really say that?&#13;
There's no way." ;.10, fine.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Do you have a scenario in mind, Richard?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No, just a number of obvious kind of areas. But why don't you. , .&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, one thing perhaps I should say at the beginning. You know Nick&#13;
fNicholasj Stern came, saw me, and he's doing this chapter on the intellectual history&#13;
ofthe Bank, and what we talked about most was, I would say, the sort of period up to&#13;
the arrival of [Robert S.] Mc;.lamara and Hollis [Cheneryj. ;.low, do you want me to.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, of course, we will see what Nick writes, and he, r think, is probably&#13;
going to get to it faster than we do, so that it would be too bad to use your time for&#13;
very much duplication.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, do you want me to say whether that's, ..&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, I think it might be a good idea. Good. I would--you had such a long&#13;
run in this organization that first of all I'd just like to know what you-what sort ofa&#13;
story do you think we should wind up telling. I mean, what are the kind of the peaks&#13;
and valleys, and are there phases any different than anybody would imagine, just&#13;
going by presidencies?&#13;
&#13;
KING: I think it's been very presidential, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We had--in one meeting of our advisory committee John Williamson, I&#13;
guess it was, said there are only three areas you can talk about: pre-McNamara,&#13;
Mcl'\amara, and post-McNamara. Do you see it that way?&#13;
&#13;
KING: I'd make some, a bit of distinction between [Eugene} Black and George&#13;
Woods.&#13;
&#13;
I.EWIS: Yeah, We've had a chance to go over some of the stuff with Robert Oliver.&#13;
In fact, he interviewed you, I think, in this, and he's been working on the Woods&#13;
period and kind of almost. , .&#13;
&#13;
KL"IG: That's it.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                         3&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's it, huh? Do you share pretty much this kind of accent he places on&#13;
Woods as an innovator?&#13;
&#13;
KING: He was somewhat of an innovator, yeah. I mean, I think he was ready to&#13;
break from tradition, but I wouldn't call him an innovator for the sake of innovation.&#13;
mean, I think he was the sort of person-he was a rather independent-minded person,&#13;
to say the least and he--when he thought something was, didn't make sense, he&#13;
decided to change it. I mean of all people \ think he was the one who made a change&#13;
in lending to government-owned industries.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Government-owned? You mean public sector?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Public-sector industries.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You mean initiating it or pushing it?&#13;
&#13;
KING: \ don 't-\ think, to the best of my recollection, which may not be very good&#13;
in this case, the Bank had for quite a time a sort of a ban on lending to publicly-owned&#13;
industry.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That was identitled with Black very much, wasn't it, that ban?&#13;
&#13;
KING: \ think it was sort of a-yeah. And I think that Woods broke it, particularly&#13;
in the case of the Indian steel industry.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But that was private sector.&#13;
&#13;
KI:&gt;JG: It was private sector, but didn't--wasn't there lending to the public sector&#13;
there, too?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I didn't know.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Maybe I'm wrong about that.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Bhilai was. you know, Soviet, and Rourkela was German. and Durgapur&#13;
was British.&#13;
&#13;
KI~G:   That's right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And then Bokaro, of course, was going to be American but it was too big to&#13;
swallow as public sector and became Soviet.&#13;
&#13;
But you probably--the U.S. went through somewhat the same kind ofchange at that&#13;
point, I think. We stopped being so up-tight about public sector and were prepared to&#13;
lend to public sector fertilizer production if they would also let some private sector go&#13;
forward. And I guess the Bank was at least sympathetic with that kind ofthing.&#13;
&#13;
What about Woods-owe get the impression-owe were both outsiders at that time;&#13;
Richard was later an insider--that somehow the temper ofthe house changed a 101&#13;
with Woods. that he--I guess Black was a terribly warm and friendly fellow who&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
people liked sort of instinctively. But we have a sense of a lot of sort of turbulence&#13;
about Woods' relations with staff. Is that right?&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's absolutely right. As a matter of fact, there arc a couple of pages about&#13;
in here. I reread this. There is quite a dichotomy between my personal relations with&#13;
Woods and the Bank's relations with Woods, other people in the Bank, although&#13;
perhaps not as great as I thought. I never had any trouble with him. I was involved&#13;
with him in a sort of personal sense really on two occasions. One was when he came&#13;
to India before the [Bernard R.} Bell mission, and the other was over the initiation of&#13;
this report on IDA [International Development Associationj policies which he wanted&#13;
prepared for Black and told me to do it. It was a Machiavellian scheme engineered by&#13;
Peter Cargill.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Let me get this. This was when Woods was president and you say it was for&#13;
Black?&#13;
&#13;
KING: For McNamara, I'm sorry.&#13;
&#13;
What--when he came to India it started about as well as possible. He was on a&#13;
Quantas flight which was an hour early and I wasn't at the airport. And his comment&#13;
on that was that it was barbaric to meet people at airports. And I won't repeat the&#13;
story at any great length, but I never had the slightest trouble with him. I found him&#13;
agreeable.&#13;
&#13;
                                 .&#13;
He asked me to come . to Bombav with him, which I did. And before he left he said,&#13;
"Is there anything else you want to say before I go to bed?" He had an early flight the&#13;
next morning.&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Yes, there is." And what I did was to--he was terribly concerned about&#13;
the Bank not saying anything which would tread on the IMF's flnternational&#13;
Monetary Fund] toes, mainly the exchange rates, or questions, not specific exchange&#13;
rates, but any question about devaluation, and I said I thought that was wrong. I said I&#13;
didn't see how in god's name the rate of exchange could--on a big mission like this-Â­&#13;
could possibly not be an issue.&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "You're right about my opinion, but," he said. "1 listen." And he did.&#13;
And he gave a bit. He didn't open the door, but he gave. And I gather Bernie Bell&#13;
talked to him after that as well. And you know what happened after.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Indeed. I've been writing about it.&#13;
&#13;
KING: And that was one occasion.&#13;
&#13;
The other one was when he asked me to write this report, which got a rather,&#13;
somewhat frosty reception from McNamara for reasons that are still not clear to me.&#13;
And he said-and this, I think, is an illustrative story about his attitudes--hc said, "I&#13;
want you to do this report and deliver it to McNamara" by sllch and such a date.&#13;
&#13;
I said, "That's impossible. I can make it by that date."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             Benjamin B. King&#13;
             August 14 and October 16 and 21,1991 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "All right, if that's the way you feel." And he said, "I don't want-I&#13;
want you to pick a young team. I don't want you to listen to any of the vice&#13;
presidents." His attitude was, clearly was, that he thought that the, his top staff were&#13;
too conservative, too--didn't have enough ideas for changing things. And he gave me&#13;
some specifications about it and said, "Come back in a week and tell me who you've&#13;
picked."&#13;
&#13;
And I came back in a week and I said, "Well, this is who I've picked." I said, "In one&#13;
respect it deviates from your specifications and this is why." [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
But he was bloody-minded as hell to a lot ofpeople, and my only conceivable&#13;
interpretation of this is that he didn't like it if people didn't stand up to him or didn't&#13;
seem straightforward. But he was--I don't know what Burke Knapp says about him; I&#13;
gather that was one of the most-that was a very disagreeable relationship. And he&#13;
was very unpleasant to a lot of people, Andrew Stephenson for one. And possibly&#13;
John Wi II iams--or was that McNamara; that may have been McNamara. But Bob&#13;
Oliver told me, when I told him what my experience was, I said, ':1 may be the only&#13;
one who feels this way," but he said, "No, no. There are others." But I don't know&#13;
who they are.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That seems to be part of Oliver's motivation, almost, to rescue the&#13;
reputation of Woods.&#13;
&#13;
This question, of course, of the role of the president is a dominant issue of the whole&#13;
history, and one thing that occurs to me--there are lots of things to be said about that,&#13;
that there should ever have been an appointment from inside and, of course, there is&#13;
the question of the U.S. dominance--but I was just thinking as you were talking that&#13;
one issue is whether, as you had a change of presidency, there is almost automatically&#13;
or tended to be a shifting around of who was in and who was out within the&#13;
organization, these people on the inside track and not. One senses in the case ofthe&#13;
change from Woods to McNamara that that may have been the case, I mean, that&#13;
people who were sort of in the middle of things during the '60s up until '68 may have&#13;
had a probability of being unfavored by the new president, and he looks around for a&#13;
new set of stars. If there's anything to that, how about from Black to Woods? I, so&#13;
far, haven't sensed any of that kind of shifting as the presidents changed. Same&#13;
people stayed in place?&#13;
&#13;
KING: I think so. In Woods' case I think it was--but it would have been much better&#13;
to consult the man himself, that he just--he didn't move Burke Knapp; he just&#13;
humiliated him.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Ah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Now, why that happened, I don't know. Burke Knapp was the dominant&#13;
figure under Woods before that, but he didn't move him.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Of course, Burke--both Knapp and McNamara seem to argue or testify that&#13;
the relations between them were quite positive. At least they say very good things&#13;
about each other. There are people, though ...&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                           6&#13;
&#13;
KING: The Board [ofExecutive Directors} didn't like Woods, either.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: ThaI's right. We picked that up. How did he provoke them?&#13;
&#13;
KING: I think il would be hard to say, for me to say, because, you know, I'd have&#13;
to--you'd have 10 have fairly continuous experience, whereas mine was very&#13;
spasmodic. I think he was just rather rude to them, ignored them.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Did that lead 10 some difficulties for the Bank, specific things that ought to&#13;
have been done?&#13;
&#13;
KING: I don't think so, no. I don't think they were obstructionist on that account,&#13;
that we would have to work with somebody [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Just a lot of smoke and noise.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, the rumor had it that ifhe hadn't quit, they wouldn't have reconfinned&#13;
him. That was a very strong rumor around. I don't know whether it waS true or not.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: There's a lot to be pursued here, but another quite different subject that&#13;
occurred to me as I looked at some ofthis~and very possibly you have talked about&#13;
with Nick--you emphasize the role that the ED! [Economic Development Institute}&#13;
plays in really instructing the Bank about ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: So you've read this thing!&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah! About project analysis, that you really dido-benefit/cost analytics&#13;
had not been used in the operation of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's true, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Did you talk to Nick about this at some length?&#13;
&#13;
KING: I think I did, but not at length, no. I certainly talked to him about it, and I've&#13;
given him a document or two, but it certainly--! certainly talked to him about it but&#13;
not at ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's a pretty interesting subject, don't you think so?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I might almost start with-oj guess that Oliver asked you what the hell did&#13;
they do before they had rate of return calculations. How did they make choices?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, I can remember~I can only remember; I mean, my answers are going&#13;
to have to be anecdotal--! remember when this, the way this cropped up in a big way&#13;
in the Bank was over the choice between hydro and thermal power where you have a&#13;
very straight comparison in which you incur capital costs and you save current costs,&#13;
and the only way of comparing that is with a discount rate.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes,&#13;
&#13;
KING: And there was one very pleasant, and I'm sure he was quite competent,&#13;
engineer whom [ talked to about this or other people talked to, and his answer was, "I&#13;
know a good hydro project when I see one," That's number one, His name was Neil&#13;
Bass; 1 remember it And the other comment, which I can't attribute to him was,&#13;
"Well, there's all that water tlowing down to the sea," And 1 think it was more or less&#13;
on that kind ofleveL ! think you-in, of course, if it was--the other mechanism, of&#13;
course, was financial. I mean, did the thing, was the thing going to make a profit?&#13;
Again, you should have some criterion about the level of profitability and also&#13;
whether the-I mean, forget shadow rates, I mean, that was nowhere near in, But,&#13;
and really if it seemed like a well-designed project, physically the kind of thing you'd&#13;
build in Germany or the U.K. or the C nited States, had a good source for raw&#13;
materials, it was a good project. I don't know that there was really much else to it.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: These lectures that you, , ,&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I mean, just to pin that down, can you place that roughly?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Place what?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That anecdote?&#13;
&#13;
KING: The hydro?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yes, roughly when was it?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Shall I do it afterwards? Make a note,&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, do it afterward.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Because I've got some notes in here and instead of wasting time looking&#13;
through it, I can, ..&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Fine, In these lectures you were giving-oj was in, at ED! right at the end of&#13;
the '50s and into the early '60s, did you get into stuff like shadow pricing?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes,&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You did, huh, And you were kind of cooking this stuff up yourself'?&#13;
mean, Ian Little wasn't there yet, doing his manuaL&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, no, This was pre-Little, I mean, it wasn't invented from thin air. People&#13;
were talking about shadow rates, I don't know what, . ,&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And it was you and who else? I mean, were there several of you in the EDI&#13;
group doing this kind of stuff'?&#13;
&#13;
KING: You know how big the ED! was then?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: No.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Four people.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Four people, huh.&#13;
&#13;
KING: So you couldn't have had more than one person doing it. I mean, I had&#13;
colleagues who sort of encouraged me to. K.S. Krishnaswamy was there, and we&#13;
used to talk about these things. I mean, it was a very small group, those two and Bill&#13;
[William1 Diamond, I think.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You were developing these ideas for better, more economic evaluation.&#13;
teaching them to people coming in from outside the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Right.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Were people inside the Bank getting the benefit of this at all at that time?&#13;
&#13;
KING: No. Not--only by my sort of extracurricular activity, I mean, by bringing it&#13;
up inside the Bank and talking to people, but not--there were occasional people who&#13;
came. Occasionally the Bank sent one of its own stafI' members to the EDI, but this&#13;
was a very rare occurrence.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Did you sense there was a huge gap between the things that you were talking&#13;
about and the way people were choosing projects?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah. In tact, see, what happened was that I brought it up at an economic&#13;
staff--or whatever it was called at the time--meeting, and I still have the document.&#13;
gave a copy to Nick. And I can very well remember that Sam [Samuel1 Lipkowitz,&#13;
who was at the time the sort of resident economist in the project staff, brought it up&#13;
there, and in a sense he was a moving spirit in proselytizing, but he said it was a hell&#13;
of a difficult job.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: How would you trace that sort of development of the methodology within&#13;
the operations ofthe Bank that when, say, Little-[James A. ] Mirrlees comes out&#13;
there's an interested audience, I presume, in the Bank for that.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, you talk to Herman van der Tak. Herman, you see, was the person&#13;
who ran with this particular balL He published, he and Jan de Weille, I think it was.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: [Lyn1 Squire?&#13;
&#13;
KING: :-';0, no, no, long before Squire. He and Jan de Weille published one of the&#13;
early occasional papers, a short-lived series, if not the first, which was called-which&#13;
wa~ about hydro and thermal, the choice between hydro and thermal projects. And he&#13;
was in the mainstream thereafter of project analysis. He and Lyn Squire, [ think,&#13;
developed the methodology for use in projects over time, and he's around. I mean,&#13;
he's a great traveler, so he's probably in the Gobi Desert at the moment, but he is&#13;
around in Washington, and he would be the person to tell you how, what happened&#13;
afterward. All I was really saying was that ...&#13;

LEW1S: Helped to get it injected, introduced into the operations.&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
LE WlS: Very interesting.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But was it actually used, even in Herman van der Tak's--just like you were&#13;
saying that there was a gap between what EDI was telling others and what the Bank&#13;
was doing inside, did that sort of gap basically continue, even in the '70s?&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, [ mean ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Doing what van der Tak was saying ought to be done, methodology and ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, I don't--I think that it-I don't think that it, that lasted when ED] got&#13;
bigger, and] don't think that necessarily it continued, that gap, because the Bank got a&#13;
lot more sophisticated once the ..&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I think there are two ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: .. particularly after. you know, when McNamara came.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: There are kind oftwo hypotheses that Devesh may be invoking. One would&#13;
be that. although the methodology was introduced by you and others and fully&#13;
adopted and became the conventional wisdom, is that's this how you choose projects,&#13;
that it was a kind of cosmetic adoption and in fact a lot ofjudgmental stuff goes on at&#13;
the same time and that there--people just weren't--there's a small literature at least&#13;
saying that benefit/costs really isn't practiced, hasn't been practiced very much.&#13;
There's one guy at Columbia writes ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well, Little and Mirrlees themselves.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's right and they're ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, Ian Little, I talked to recently, and he says the same thing, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And the other hypothesis is that the use of this methodology, particularly&#13;
OED {Operations Evaluation Department]. has become excessively confident and&#13;
that the analytics are not supported by very good data, that the numbers underneath it&#13;
are not very reliable and so there is a kind of a false confidence in rate of return&#13;
estimates that you get, that are used by the evaluators ex-post.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well. I think, if! can remember what both were, I think both are true. 1 think&#13;
the use of rates of return became a sort of fundamentalist religion under McNamara. I&#13;
mean, the ayatollah wanted a rate of return, and the ayatollah was bloody well going&#13;
to get one. And a lot of it was garbage.&#13;

&#13;
And what was sad was, you see, that McNamara--it was perverted by McNamara&#13;
because he would say in his speeches, "Our rates of return, average rate of return on&#13;
our projects is 13.76 percent or more than that, and we have some projects where the&#13;
rate ofreturn is 27 percent." Now, the obvious question is if the rate ofreturn on a&#13;
particular project is 27 percent, the question is rcally have you've done enough&#13;
because if it's so good, why not do more? Or else you're filling an excruciating&#13;
bottleneck, I mean, you've put in a washer and the machine runs, and you can get a&#13;
huge ratc of return from that.&#13;
&#13;
The secondo-so there was tremendous pressure to produce rates of return, and all sorts&#13;
of amazing gimmicks were used, There was the justification for telecommunications&#13;
in Nepal, I think, for, that it would enable, it would benefit the tourist industry&#13;
because people could book flights much bettcr and there wouldn't be a lot of empty&#13;
planes, The reason there were empty planes is that half ofthe seats were reserved for&#13;
the royal family and the ministers, and it wasn't anything to do with the telephones,&#13;
The other thing was, they suggested was, that the merchants down in the Terai could&#13;
get prices, better prices, knowledge of prices and so on, Well, merchants in the Terai&#13;
and on the other side ofthe Indian border have been getting prices without the&#13;
slightest trouble for several centuries and were accused all the time of making a&#13;
killing at the expense of the peasants and the poor consumers, so I mean any benefitÂ­&#13;
I mean, that is an actual case! I'm not--this is not a fabricated example.&#13;
&#13;
And then, as I learned recently--l did a study for the OED because there has always&#13;
been a suspicion (and shared by Dennis DeTray, who was then research advisor)--that&#13;
you could use this mass of OED data for some sort of research project. And there has&#13;
been a certain amount, There have been several studies by Gerbard Pohl and a fellow&#13;
from one ofthe North Carolina universities&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
KING: I haven't seen his latest one. Ofthese rates of return, and my, what I got out&#13;
of my investigation was a very frank statement that rates of return were cooked, It&#13;
was not bad data, but if you've got--and this is another of McNamara's sins, in my&#13;
opinion; I mean, I think there were many good things that he did, but his, this&#13;
excessive programmatic approach was, I think, his greatest sino-and that was that if&#13;
you bave a program and you've got Railways II in January and Hydroelectric IV in&#13;
April and Rural Development VI in September and your paycheck and your&#13;
promotion depend on fulfilling those projects, you're going to put on your roseÂ­&#13;
colored glasses. And you're going to, if you think that the price of cotton or the flow&#13;
of water iso-everything is going to be optimistic: the cost of digging the rock out or&#13;
the speed with which farmers take up a new practice. Everything is kind ofroseÂ­&#13;
colored, and you can, , ,&#13;
&#13;
McNamara was not a person for ranges, He was a point man, The shadow rate of&#13;
exchange or the number of beds per, hospital beds per inhabitant was 2379, It wasn't&#13;
in Afghanistan somewhere between two and nine, I mean, you know, he wouldn't,&#13;
And people would not say, "Here is a confidence belt. My best guess is this If the&#13;
conditions are so and so, but it could be as high as so and so, and it could be as low as&#13;
so and so." That was taboo. So I think that this insistence on precision--and, coupled&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
with the programmatic approach, which meant there was a need to be optimistic--was&#13;
responsible for a good deal of skepticism on the part of, you know, cynicism,&#13;
&#13;
There was a very interesting--I have a parallel case of, I think it was the New York&#13;
telephone system or New York electricity system where they had, they instituted a&#13;
new reporting system for work underground. And rates of whatever it was shot up as&#13;
soon as this system went into effect, and it was a sort of "what-the-boss-wants effect."&#13;
&#13;
There was no doubt that that cast a lot of--and then there were people who had what I&#13;
think were legitimate doubts, not about the intrinsic merits of costlbenefit analysis&#13;
with whatever Little-Mirrlees ramifications you might want to put on it, but their&#13;
doubts lay in the fact that if you did not have parallel policies which were changing&#13;
the shadow rates to actual rates, your project wouldn't go. And, of course, this was&#13;
true. I mean, if the shadow rate for the farmer for cotton was 30 cents but he was only&#13;
getting 15 cents, it still wouldn't be [inaudible] I mean, it might theoretically from a&#13;
national point of view be a great project, but if people wouldn't do it, that really didn't&#13;
help. That was a sort of a, in a sense, a side issue, but it was an issue.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It's an important issue.&#13;
&#13;
KING: It's an important issue.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's a dominant issue now [inaudible] the elimination of these price supports&#13;
is the [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: .. seen as--that's what it boils down to, isn't it? In other words, you can't&#13;
carry these shadow rates for long because they need ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: Some you can and some you can't. I mean, I suppose that if it's something&#13;
the government owns and it chooses to subsidize, it doesn't-it may make less&#13;
difference. But I mean if you're talking about farmer incentives, clearly it is not very&#13;
viable.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: If you're talking about shadow wage rates, which are lower than the&#13;
nominal, then somebody has to pick up that tab. That's when you have a public&#13;
finance effect.&#13;
&#13;
I'd like to press just a little but further in this McNamara sort of analysis because I&#13;
think you've given me, at least, one handle we didn't have before. We have heard all&#13;
of the sort of bashing of McNamara in terms of over-targeting, that he was pressing,&#13;
demanding answers and then forcing loans to be made when they weren't ripe yet and&#13;
so on. And I think it's very easy, particularly for academics, to sort of share that&#13;
critique rather wisely. On the other hand, I at least have had second thoughts about&#13;
that, which I gather Stan [Stanley] Fisher had while he was here and working in the&#13;
institution, namely that--I put it in the McNamara case this way--that if you came into&#13;
an institution and if you had suddenly gotten religion about the need for promoting&#13;
development by transferring resources and you thought this was sort of the central&#13;
player in that game, you might in 1968 have been convinced that just the rate of flow&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                       12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
was altogether too small, that there needed really a quantum sort of increase in&#13;
activity, that this was in the direction of good things. Then if you want too-and the&#13;
institution is kind of bureaucratic; they have good people, but they've got their own&#13;
modes of operation and so on and you've got to move them. Somehow or another&#13;
you've got to start setting goals for them too-so you could see a kind of almost a priori&#13;
case for targeting. Now, what you've come up with to me is even if one accepted that&#13;
defense, this kind of manic precision, this attempt to be precise about the rate of&#13;
return, can inject a sort of element of phoniness into the whole operation that wouldn't&#13;
have been there if you just were having a sort of intentionally sort of warlike drive.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, welL I think to get to the first point, you see the point--I think the issue&#13;
is this: you're quite right. If you don't--and this is true in many circumstances--ifyou&#13;
don't aim high, you won't get anywhere. On the other hand, [ think that what you&#13;
need to do is to say, "This is our objective." Now I in my right mind don't think I'm&#13;
going to get it, and I'm not going to be too bothered about not getting it, and also I am&#13;
going to accept what I think are genuine reasons not to do something. But I don't&#13;
think McNamara had these reservations. I can't go into his head, but he--I think that&#13;
people who carried out his--or ifhe did have reservations; I take it back; to some&#13;
extent he did. But he favored people who would, you know, were gung-ho on these&#13;
things.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I think the--a good example is the program, the poverty program, the poverty&#13;
program which in essence started a kind of another numbers game--you know. I&#13;
mean, it happened in Vietnam, too, so we're not talking about just the Bank--another&#13;
numbers game in which projects were identified which benefited the poor. whoever&#13;
they were, and however done. Now, this isn't an easy exercise, to say how. But I&#13;
mean he employed, I think it was, Kim [Edward v'K.] Jaycox as a sort of commissar&#13;
for poverty, and the result was, among other things, that you would take the project to&#13;
the poor instead of the poor to the project. And there were examples of--in Africa&#13;
particularly--where, because a region was poverty-stricken, you built a bad project&#13;
there. It reminds me of Arthur Lewis's famous remark about, I think it was, British&#13;
subsidies for hilltop farming. He said that if people are fatheaded enough to try and&#13;
tlmn on top of a hill, there's no reason to subsidize them. And I think it was this sort&#13;
of almost lack of humor in a sense that, you know, he was such a driven man! And&#13;
he--but ifyou--I think he could be argued with. But he put in layers between him and&#13;
other people. I mean, there were some people who would argue with him but not so&#13;
many, and the rank and file of people in the Bank would say, "Well, we need to keep&#13;
our poverty programs." And any gimmick would do. And furthermore ...&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B[&#13;
&#13;
KING: .. and be for Africa, which meant a big target for African agriculture.&#13;
Nobody knew anything about African agriculture, and I remember somebody, Bob&#13;
[Robert] Picciotto, I'm pretty sure it was, saying, telling me at the time, he said, "I&#13;
have a good 1 million dollar pilot project, but Thave to make it into a 10 million&#13;
dollar project." And, you know, African development has. been gone over--what's her&#13;
name?&#13;

&#13;
KING: Lma Lele, you know, the MADIA [Managing Agricultural Development in&#13;
Africa] project, and the results are there. The results also show up even in the OED&#13;
rates of return, rates of return studies done for OED.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: What do you make ofthe--you said that he sort oflayered himself, but I'm&#13;
just thinking that you begin to get this vision or image of McNamara of sort of driven&#13;
and lacking humor. And I've known him for a long time, and I must say that in a&#13;
sense he does lack a sense of humor. He'll laugh heartily, but ...&#13;
&#13;
What do you make of Ernie [Ernest] Stern? I mean, Ernie is-I mean, he was&#13;
certainly a-he was made by Me""amara within the Bank, picked up on a very fast&#13;
track. He's a very hard-nosed guy. Would he. would McNamara have sought-of&#13;
course, Burke was quite different in terms of personality. My sense is that there was&#13;
not the same closeness between Knapp and MeN amara that there was between Stern&#13;
and McNamara. {inaudible] I don't,&#13;
&#13;
KING: I remember when Stem was brought in. He was brought in to work by&#13;
Hollis,&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
KING: I mean, what went on between Hollis and Mc""amara I don't know, but ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Do you have any perception of--I don't want to stick with these personality&#13;
things--but does Mahbub [ul-Haq] fit into your sort of sense of personal dynamics of&#13;
the McNamara operation? Did he figure large?&#13;
&#13;
KING: He made a lot of noise, but I don't really think he--l doubt that he made a&#13;
tremendous difference. Mahbub was a smooth operator and personally very&#13;
agreeable, and he ran this division which reviewed country programs, and he wrote&#13;
and produced policy papers. I mean, to that extent--policy papers. I suppose, had&#13;
some influence on the Bank, I mean, they were a form of dissemination of what the&#13;
sort of leading ideas were. But I have a sense that if Mahbub hadn't done it,&#13;
somebody else would. I--Mahbub was-he w8sn't--1 don't really know what his ideas&#13;
are, I mean, and he was very social, conscious of ideas, But I don't think he had an&#13;
enormous effect on the Bank, no. More in Pakistan, at least for a time.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: From time to time, yes.&#13;
&#13;
KING: De temps en temps.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Richard?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, just more generally, we talked to a number of people--it surprises me&#13;
how many, especially younger but not only younger people in the Bank, who will&#13;
make, who will at the end maybe of a conversation, getting up after lunch, will say,&#13;
"Well, I just hope you don't-I just hope this history isn't another whitewash."&#13;
Remarks of that kind. What would you make of that? What's your reaction?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
KING: Irs a very interesting thing, what you've just said. I mean, are you talking&#13;
about people who've been in the Bank five years, ten years?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's very interesting. See, I know--I left the Bank in 1981, in February--a&#13;
rather remarkable six-month interregnum in which [--it happened after Anne Krueger&#13;
left.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, you--I see.&#13;
&#13;
KING: You know, when Anne Krueger left and [Barber B.] Conable's&#13;
reorganization, they--she left because she had a disagreement with Conable at the&#13;
time--and they knew they couldn't offer somebody her job beeause the Bank was&#13;
going to be reorganized. You don't go around asking Stan Fisher if he wants a job&#13;
which won't be there tomorrow. So they had the idea of asking me to take the job for&#13;
an interim six months, which I did. And, well, so I had a sort of vignette of the Bank&#13;
for those six months.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS; What were the dates, those six months?&#13;
&#13;
KING: January I, 1987, to June 30, 1987.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And the great reorganization?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Right in the middle! Absolutely! Saw the whole bit. And I finally wTOte a&#13;
note which made great publicity, even in the Washington Post, to Conable about it.&#13;
&#13;
But so I left. My leaving was more or less coincidental with McNamara's. It was&#13;
three months of {Alden w.j Clausen; I didn't even know he was there. So you had&#13;
five years with Clausen and five years with Conable. So, that's ten years; well, it's&#13;
nearly five years. No, it is five years.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
KING: It's my impression, and I don't know how much of it happened under&#13;
Clausen, but it's my impression from talking to people that many people in the Bank-Â­&#13;
I go there every so often; I run into people and [ ask them--that the morale has sunk a&#13;
great deal. I mean, when McNamara was there, at least he was a figure. You might&#13;
say, "This bastard is doing a lot of stupid things," but at least he was, you had a&#13;
feeling there was somebody to shoot at, but not you--it's more difficult to shoot at a&#13;
jellyfish. And I have the impression that the leadership has deteriorated-I mean, at&#13;
the top--and also that the influence of the U.S. government and the more ludicrous&#13;
ideas from the U.S. government receive much more credence than they used to. I&#13;
mean, McNamara ..&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, he buffered it quite well.&#13;
&#13;
KING: .. resisted quite a lot. So one qualification which I WOUld, well. one&#13;
observation I would make on this remark is there may be a lot of people in the Bank&#13;

&#13;
who think that a lot of things are wrong, and I wouldn't--it would be diflicult for me&#13;
to be specific on saying what they are--and would not like it covered up, would not&#13;
like it whitewashed.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I don't think that what has been written about the Bank, if you take the whole&#13;
totality of--I mean, from [Edward} Mason and [Robert} Asher and other things about&#13;
the Bank--I don't think much has been left out. Even Teresa Hayter said ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: There is that perspective, yes.&#13;
&#13;
KING: So I suspect that there's-I don't know if-I mean, I don't know if the sort of&#13;
pros and cons of what McNamara did (because there were pros, I think, definite pros)&#13;
have been sort of cohesively written up, but I don't think that-I mean. there is&#13;
enough public material that it would be diflicult to whitewash and get away with it.&#13;
Now, what they may be worried about is that the current problems at the Bank,&#13;
whatever they may be--l mean, I can say what I think is, the result of them is, but I&#13;
can't go into the specifics of the reasons. The--that may be what they're referring to&#13;
because when you said the younger people, that struck me that that ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's not the really young people.&#13;
&#13;
KIN(;: Well, I mean people who've been there a couple of years, no. But I mean,&#13;
people who've been there maybe ten years, ten, fifteen. well, tifteen's still ten out of&#13;
the fifteen, and I think that's ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, and people go back. A lot of people are no longer in the Bank, but I&#13;
don't know ifthere's any real correlation between the people who left the Bank or&#13;
were dropped and attitudes. Or at least, let's say, their degree of cynicism.&#13;
&#13;
KING: You don't know whether they ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah, [wonder whether there i5--[ doubt that there is ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Much of a c&lt;.)rrelation?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Ycah. In other words. I think people just live with their cynicism. If they&#13;
had any1hing to say they would have been saying it. Maybe that's wrong.&#13;
&#13;
KIN(;: You mean morally wrong or ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No, empirically, empirically.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: What you say about the McNamara right or wrong as a leader, that I think&#13;
has resonated quite a bit in the conversations I remember. The shift from McNamara&#13;
to post-McNamara meant that, for all his faults. you'd had somebody who was clearly&#13;
a leader and then had a program, and it was a well-intentioned program, by and large.&#13;
It was on the side ofthe angels. sort of.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, he had good intentions, but you know where those lead.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, I know. I know. Bul anyway, when you take away that kind ofa&#13;
sense of mission and then you also have a lot more kind of pressure coming from the&#13;
biggest donor and this sort ofjellyfish kind of phenomenon at the top for awhile, it's&#13;
easy to kind of expect a change in morale, I think, in the institution. If you hate the&#13;
son of a bitch, you're sort of in stride somehow or another in the '70s. Of course,&#13;
another thing is that he was in charge for 13 years. We've found ourselves wondering&#13;
about these five-year terms that ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: Hobart Rowan talks about it--not my favorite columnist, but he does.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, I guess he did.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: You mentioned one subject in the oral history on ED!, and it's sort of&#13;
striking that at the beginning EDI was, seems to have been relatively speaking an&#13;
important part of the institution.&#13;
&#13;
KI:'IIG: It is important.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I mean in the sense that good people went to EDI right when it was&#13;
established.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, Alex [Alexander K.) Caimcross started it. I mean, you know, he's not&#13;
an inconsiderable figure.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right, But then after that one sort of sees in the relative sort of power&#13;
within the institution of sort of who goes to EDI and so on.&#13;
&#13;
KING: It was considered kind of a back--it was a place where you put people who ..&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Who were sort of dumped.&#13;
&#13;
KING: .. out to grass.&#13;
&#13;
KAP13R: Right, right.&#13;
&#13;
KING: I think that has 10 some extent happened. Of course, like many other things,&#13;
when you start something there's necessarily an innovative spirit because you can't do&#13;
anything but innovate if you're starting something new. The words are the same. And&#13;
so it is attractive. And also, I referred to it in here, I think. as having a country club&#13;
atmosphere. And indeed it did. We had a very nice house on Belmont Street, which&#13;
has been tom down, and I went to look at it not long ago. And there were these four&#13;
people, a couple or two or three secretaries and a young man who was the manager,&#13;
the sort of house manager, and we had one--{me--six-month course. So it was---it&#13;
out-academiaed academia, because we had six months on and six months off.&#13;
&#13;
The question is what do you do in the six months off? Well, it meant that you could&#13;
do a lot of preparation for the next course. Now, what of course in fact happened was&#13;
people said, "Who are we going to get to send on this mission to Ireland, which we&#13;
don't quite know what the hell it's for? Well, there's Ben King up at the EDt He's&#13;

&#13;
doing damn all, sitting on his rear end. We'll send him!" And so it meant that you&#13;
occasionally-you got--it wasn't completely gravy.&#13;
&#13;
And there was an institution that after the day's work there was a little bar and any&#13;
participant who wanted to could stay and chat and have a drink. And one member of&#13;
the statfwas designated every day (or every week or whatever it was) to stay on duty.&#13;
I mean, he was the host for the evening. He got a few drinks, I guess, as a result, and&#13;
this is why it was called the country club. And the atmosphere was not what it is now,&#13;
which is a factory. I mean, you know, there's this course and this course and this&#13;
course, like everything else. It was a very leisurely--l think in the best sense--I mean I&#13;
don't think we just did damn all. but it was a process which was not-was sort of&#13;
conducive to sort of getting to know participants, and that was important because they&#13;
contributed a great deal to the courses. Some of them did, made an enonnous&#13;
difference.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Was Michael Hoffmann there when you were?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, yes, Mike Hoffmann was, I think, did a good job. I mean, he let you&#13;
alone to do your thing. He was very good externally. You know he'd come from&#13;
,New York Times. He would get good people in from outside, all sorts of people, from&#13;
academia, from non-academia. We had excellent people coming in, and he arranged&#13;
very good field trips, I remember being terribly impressed at the Federal Reserve in&#13;
New York at the extraordinary efficiency with which banks were regulated in the&#13;
United States. {Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I can go one better than that. I remember the first time I met the BCCI&#13;
{Bank ofCommerce and Credit International] people, how impressed I was by their&#13;
spirituality! Going on about god {inaudible] and the poor.&#13;
&#13;
But also, going back to a very general level, have you ever sort of done a mental&#13;
exercise trying to imagine what a particular LDC [less developed country] would look&#13;
like if the Bank had never existed? How much difference might the Bank have made?&#13;
&#13;
KING: I have not done the exercise in the way you've suggested. It's a sort of, you&#13;
know, counterfactual sort of exercise: what would happen if there was no Bank? I&#13;
think that--what I have begun to say, after a drink or two, these days is that I think the&#13;
Bank has become irrelevant. Obviously, it's not completely irrelevant, but I don't&#13;
think it has the sort of relevance that it did have. I think that a lot of things have&#13;
happened in the period, 40-odd years, that it's been in existence. There is a much&#13;
greater sophistication in many countries. And I suppose that there would be some&#13;
countries which--where it might have made a lot of difference. I can't pick them out&#13;
offhand. In some cases they might have been better off without the Bank on the--I&#13;
suppose on the rather cynical grounds that if you don't, if you are enabled not to put&#13;
your house in order by the Bank's actions, you put off putting your house in order and&#13;
that just puts offthe evil day.&#13;
&#13;
I have a feeling that the Bank's long involvement with India may have given India&#13;
much less, may have contributed to India's welfare a lot less than it should have. I&#13;
mean, you're dealing with a sophisticated government--too damned sophisticated&#13;
sometimes!--and world-class economists and good, excellent administrators, and yet a&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
lot of the things which needed doing were not done. Now, maybe this is a political&#13;
problem as much as anything else.&#13;
&#13;
I'm not going to say anything about Latin America. I mean, I defer to you about that.&#13;
Did the Bank make a difference in Mexico?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I don't think so. I mean, I have a-I find it hard to convince myselfthat it's&#13;
made a difference in any country that I know 01: but my problem is that I find it very&#13;
hard to know how to answer the question.&#13;
&#13;
KING: It is difficult. I'll tell you, there's one country I did a certain amount of work&#13;
on quite recently for the Bank, and that's Zambia. The reason I did it was they wanted&#13;
a kind of retrospective of why the structural adjustment loan fell apart rather&#13;
catastrophically over the--and they said, "Well, you go back over the past five years."&#13;
&#13;
r said, "No, I'm going back 50 years because that's the only way to do it in Zambia,"&#13;
because I had--it was one ofthe first places I went to in the Bank, and I had read the&#13;
Colonial Office reports of30 years earlier than that.&#13;
&#13;
And my guess would be that the Bank probably had a negative influence in Zambia&#13;
because there was a case par excellence where--but when you talk about the Bank,&#13;
you really have to talk about the Bank and the sort of international aid effort. You&#13;
can't separate the two.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Okay. That's not cheating?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, then you have to make up a scenario: without the Bank, what would&#13;
the Scandinavians and the AID [US. Agencyfor International DevelopmentJ--how&#13;
would they, would they have existed in the same form? Would they, or would the&#13;
Scandinavians just been out there running clinics or ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: If you look at the volume of net Bank transfers to LDCs, I think it might&#13;
amount to 2 or 3 percent, as an estimate, of LDC investment.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, that's--ofinvestment?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Investment.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Ah, yes. But I mean ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But it currently is running more like under I percent.&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, it's going down, but it's a bit like the Fund, that at the real point of real&#13;
crisis the net flow is zero.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KING: But I think that the Bank had a great deal to do with the way aid flowed into&#13;
countries, and it's hard to say what-to take it out and leave a residual flow. But my&#13;
guess is that this, that in Zambia it really made a negative contribution because it, the&#13;

&#13;
Bank was entranced by the copper prospects. Here was a country with riches, one of&#13;
the richer countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. It had copper, a very well-functioning,&#13;
well-run--reasonably well-run--copper industry. And exports--even when prices went&#13;
down, it was doing all right. Very creditworthy. And here was an excellent example&#13;
to pour money in, not only into hydroelectric projects and things ofthat sort and&#13;
roads, but agricultural projects. And that certainly postponed the evil day, and the&#13;
evil day is extremely evil now because the copper industry is suffering like that and&#13;
absolutely nothing to replace it.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This is a very interesting line of discussion, and it strikes me that ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: You can trust Richard to ask questions like that!&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: In your whole experience here, you don't quickly think of any country&#13;
where you do feel that Bank has had a positive impact? I mean, it's sort of a striking,&#13;
significant experience ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's not quite what Richard asked, which was, "Do you think it would have&#13;
made a material difference if the Bank ... " I think there are positive things that the&#13;
Bank did. Now, the man who was Executive Director for Brazil for many years-Â­&#13;
what's his name?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Here in the Bank or in the Fund?&#13;
&#13;
KING: In the Bank. You know.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: [Pedro S} Malan?&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, no, no, before Malan. Has a daughter who works at the Bank. You&#13;
know him very well. Anyway, he was an economist, sophisticated character, and he&#13;
said, "The biggest contribution the Bank ever made to Brazil was it taught us how to&#13;
prepare projects."&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: How to prepare?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Projects. In other words--and I think that one should never lose sight of thisÂ­&#13;
-from way back that even without the costlbenefit analysis being there or being&#13;
particularly good or bad, the fact that you really should sit down and get a bunch of&#13;
engineers to do a, you know, feasibility study and to bore into the rock or test the soil&#13;
and really do a proper study of a major project was a novelty! It was a novelty almost&#13;
everywhere. I mean, the story--I mean, you know [John Maynard} Keynes made&#13;
speeches at Bretton Woods about the kinds of projects that were financed in the '30s,&#13;
and those were brought to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
And even the Bank got caught occasionally. I mean, I remember one project in Orissa&#13;
where they didn't have enough water for the--there was less water than they thought.&#13;
And I think that this, this contribution probably the Bank advanced as a capability, as&#13;
an understanding, ten years, twenty years later. And I think that was a major&#13;
contribution.&#13;

&#13;
WEBB: Do you think, just intuitively ..&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, go on.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: .. that that's what the main story is about in the Bank, its influence, the&#13;
extent to which it's improved, let's say, the quality of development management in&#13;
one way or another?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah. I think that maybe-l think that is a much underplayed thesis because&#13;
it's easy to forget how primitive, totally primitive, this was back when the Bank&#13;
started in developing countries--and some developed ones, too,&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Would you link that or separate it from the more recent emphasis on&#13;
policy?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, I link policy, even the structural adjustment policy ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, yes. Because as you know there was a bit of that in India way back&#13;
when, sort of an antecedent of the structural adjustment loan.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, that was the intended-I mean, the [Bernard R.] Bell--what happened&#13;
after the Bell mission was intended as a sort of structural adjustment&#13;
&#13;
I~EWIS:   That's right.&#13;
&#13;
KING: It didn't work. The, well, the present policy emphasis is something which I&#13;
think is--and I said this as far back as when I was still in the Bank; I remember saying&#13;
it to Hollis in the latc '70s--that another effect of the programmatic approach was that&#13;
you had a project stream which was the, on which the main emphasis was. And then&#13;
there was, you know, you write an economic report and had a kind of policy&#13;
discussion with the government. And I think I should mention here, too, that this&#13;
meant that you wouldn't have policy discussions with the government linked to your&#13;
project program. And this is where I have a major disagreement with Stanley Please,&#13;
who was a great advocate of the structural adjustment.&#13;
&#13;
KAPVR: In your oral history ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: What?       ,&#13;
&#13;
KAPL'R: In your oral history, you and Stanley Please are absolutely at odds.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Absolutely, absolutely. And I have memos to Stanley which I can give you a&#13;
copy of if you like. You see, I don't, can't remember when Stanley got involved in&#13;
this, but the notion that a program of projects cannot be linked-I don't mean to say&#13;
that you send out an education advisor to discuss macroeconomic policy in connection&#13;
with these projects or that you necessarily hold up the projects because, you know,&#13;
they've hired too many people for the sports ministry. But what you do is to say,&#13;
"Look, we're perfectly willing to continue lending for these projects and so on and so&#13;
forth for awhile, but we need to have a program of policy change going along with it,&#13;
and let's discuss that." But what happened was that you might be discussing with the&#13;

&#13;
minister in Brazil or the Ivory Coast or whatever, things, policy changes which might&#13;
be considered necessary. and they would laugh at you, not necessarily--they were&#13;
polite people to your face-but I mean it would, because they knew that these fellows&#13;
who were coming out to do their piggyback education projects were going to go ahead&#13;
and that. irrespective.&#13;
&#13;
So the policy changes which might have been made as part of a general pressure&#13;
about the volume of lending were not made. And when I said, "Why can't you raise&#13;
questions about policy in connection with loans?" Stanley Please and people who&#13;
thought the same way laughed. They said, "The idea is ridiculous. You can't have ..&#13;
." But the fact is that this wasn't truc. I mean, you don't necessarily link it to that&#13;
specific loan and say, "A condition ofIcnding is the following." But you talk to the&#13;
minister of finance or the minister of planning and say, "Well. look we have this loan&#13;
signing coming up and we just would like to remind you that when we last met you&#13;
said that you would do something about" whatever it was; electricity rates or&#13;
whatever, "and how is it going?" And get the idea across that you were interested.&#13;
And every time there was a loan, there is no reason why you shouldn't do that. And&#13;
this would be a sort of structural adjustment or policy ...&#13;
&#13;
"Structural adjustment" is a very bad term. It has meant something quite different in&#13;
relation to the oil shock, and it has been abused since then. But policy changes could&#13;
be done by inches and probably much more diplomatically, without ministers being&#13;
publicly tarred with the brush of yielding to the neo-imperialists, people from the&#13;
Bank. But it could be a matter of discussion in which you could say, "We understand&#13;
you have problems. We understand that there are these political difficulties, but&#13;
something needs to be done on these fronts, and you tell us that--let's keep a dialogue&#13;
and a discussion going on what's to be done." These new sort of-the structural&#13;
adjustment loans, the post-oil shock ones, which are really sort of macroeconomic&#13;
policy changes, those loans were catch-up loans, "catch-up" because it hadn't been&#13;
done before. This is my thesis. Stanley Please ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: [both talking at once] No, I'm with Stanley on this one, but I'm not going to&#13;
argue with you. I wouldn't-l agree with you completely about the malmers of the&#13;
discussion. It's very ham-handed, this preconditioning kind of mode that they got&#13;
into. But you described, though, how you would have this sort of on-going chat with&#13;
the minister, this leads me to the ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, there were also annual meetings.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, I know, what you, but in my mind, in terms of my experience,&#13;
describing as the experience of a resident who is sort of in constant, on-going&#13;
conversation with his counterparts.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Not necessarily. Not necessarily. But that, too, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I mean, I was going to ask you. You were resident in DeIhL but you were&#13;
in an organization that--India's a partial exception; Indonesia's a much greater&#13;
exception--but most a f these operated very headquarters-centered operations, and do&#13;
you think that ...&#13;

&#13;
KING: It could have been done from headquarters? Yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It could have been done from headquarters.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, I--my, you see, early operational experience--of course, it's a long way&#13;
back now--was that these were automatically the sort of things that one would talk&#13;
about and that-oJ mean, at places as far apart as Norway and Zambia, two ofthe&#13;
countries I visited early in my Bank life. And ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Are you talking about the '50s, also the '60s?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, I mean, Spain. ! mean, it wasn't until about the late '60s that this--no,&#13;
it was the '70s, I suppose--that this [inaudible] what I call the catch-up period. I left&#13;
the Bank in 1981, and [ must have--I remember! still have a couple of things. I wrote&#13;
to Hollis about it. I'll be glad to send you a copy of it.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I'd like to see it. Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KING: I think--in which I definitely remember the discussions about it. And there&#13;
would be a lot of work put into a briefing for the annual meeting apart from any1hing&#13;
else, but normally you would be expected on a mission to go out.&#13;
&#13;
But then I think the other thing which, one of the additional things which may have&#13;
induced the change is that there were fewer-omissions became more professionalized.&#13;
You would have, you know, maybe [inaudible] mission in which you had people in&#13;
educational and agricultural departments, whereas earlier I think there were more&#13;
general missions. You know, that you would have somebody who would be dealing-Â­&#13;
I mean, my first mission to Zam bia, which was way, way back, we had an engineer,&#13;
myself, and the leader of the mission who was an operational analyst. That was about&#13;
the loan to the railways, but these things changed. But I don't think that you could not&#13;
devise a way where somebody from ...&#13;
&#13;
{End Tape 1, Side BI&#13;
{Begin Tape 2, Side Al&#13;
&#13;
KING: ... what's the operations department for except to carry out programs?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I think your point about the scale of the mission is important, but my&#13;
impression was that if you were trying to do a fertilizer loan, you damned well had to&#13;
put all your energy into working with the ministries of agriculture and petrochemicals&#13;
and fertilizers to get that thing right.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And there wasn't much carrying capacity left over for talking about general&#13;
policy.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But even in that sort of--now, there was also the point, I think, that, at least&#13;
in the case of the Indian government, they wanted this quick flowing program stuff&#13;
very much. It's an attractive kind of foreign exchange to get and therefore you could&#13;
buy more attention to policy issues if you had that kind of a commodity offer than if&#13;
you were coming out with a kind of a routine project. And so it had both sort of a bait&#13;
effect and a focus effect, that you could talk about-the sort of the instrument kind of&#13;
fitted the target in tenns ofthe--and I know, at least on the bilateral side in India at the&#13;
time, we had a very strong sense of that. I think probably that carried over to Ernie&#13;
Stern. And at any rate that--I hear your argument.&#13;
&#13;
KING: It didn't make much difference to the Indian government policy.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, we won't go into that right now because I think we did make a&#13;
difference. Certainly in agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
KING: In agriculture it's possible.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I think so. But that is for another day. I think we did even more; I think&#13;
you did more on the liberalization side than--well, I'll step back a half step. We&#13;
almost did more if we hadn't mucked up on the delivering the 900 million for a series&#13;
of years. We did with the Indians, it turned out in fact, and that I. G. Patel never got&#13;
over, and the whole ministry really [inaudible] a long story&#13;
&#13;
KING: I would sayan obfuscated story. It does reflect little credit on either side.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right. Right.&#13;
&#13;
KING: But I do think that-but I would make one final point on this issue, was that&#13;
it got to the point where people did not think there was an alternative. I don't&#13;
necessarily say that, you know, some animals are good, some animals have two feet,&#13;
four feet, good and bad, but the mindset of people was this was the only way to&#13;
change policy, and that I think has to be wrong. Now, which is better in which case&#13;
and how you do it in any given case is, may be an arguable case, but to say that this is&#13;
the only way, that has to be wrong.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I'll buy that.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I'm embarrassed to go on now. We've kept you a long time.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Time with me is a very cheap commodity.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Devesh would like to know ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [inaudible] Richard on this question, the last one, who in your mind, I&#13;
mean, who is the Bank really responsible to? I mean, how do you sort of-well, you&#13;
know, other people say it's owned by its shareholders and like any sort of entity, you&#13;
know, it's really responsible to countries, to the shareholders and so on and so forth.&#13;
But in many ways that's a little bit of a figment.&#13;
&#13;
KING: It's a very good question. You keep asking good questions.&#13;
&#13;
                             Benjamin B. King&#13;
             August 14 and October 16 and 21,1991 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I think that's changed, too, you sec. Again, when the Bank was new it was a bit like&#13;
what you were saying, or one of you was saying, about the EDJ, that it had very highÂ­&#13;
caliber directors, and Black would talk to these guys and was, I think, much&#13;
inlluenced by them. And, you know, people like {J. William] Fulbright got very&#13;
interested in the Bank. And it was conceived of as something to which a government&#13;
would give a good deal of attention. And I don't mean, you know, that Mr. [David}&#13;
Mulford would bring his current pet idea in to shop it around. And consequently the&#13;
shareholders really took an interest, I think, in what was going on. And I don't think&#13;
they're doing it now.&#13;
&#13;
I-when I had (during this reorganization experience in 1987) resurrection, a lot of-Â­&#13;
there was consternation, fear, and everything else, and a lot of people in the Bank&#13;
went to their Executive Directors and said, "I'm being screwed royally. Do something&#13;
about it." One of the Executive Directors--l think he's still there, [Jacques} de&#13;
Groote--wrote the memo to Conable, complaining about the way things were being&#13;
done, and that was done from what I would call the level of "I-am-interested-in-theÂ­&#13;
welfare-of-the-Bank-I'm-also-intcrested-in-Belgians-too," but that comes down there&#13;
compared with the way things have been going on, Not so, most of them. The Italian&#13;
director wanted to take care of the Italians, The Germans were worried what the&#13;
percentage of Germans who were getting kicked out was. The French were. , .&#13;
&#13;
I personally went to see the British ED and told him, I said, "Look, you know, this is&#13;
not a very proper way of doing things." .&#13;
&#13;
He said, "No, I know." And he said, "I've tried to do something but I can't get up&#13;
much enthusiasm."&#13;
&#13;
And my general impression at the lime was that the European governments, if they&#13;
want to have a quarrel with the United States, they're going to have it over something&#13;
else and not over the World Bank. I don't-I can't document that. I can only give&#13;
that as a hypothesis to be tested, but that would be my--I would bet that European&#13;
governments have rather small interest in the Bank. The Japanese probably even less.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Even less Japanese.&#13;
&#13;
KING: And I think they're to the place where the Japanese formally make nice&#13;
gestures when a gesture is called for, but apart from promoting the likes of&#13;
Matsushita, I ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You don't think there's going to be a Japanese president soon?&#13;
&#13;
KING: They have their Asian Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, yeah, but that's not enough.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They want the Fund or the Bank as well.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                               25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                       KING: Well, maybe the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
                       But I don't think that the U.S.-I don't really think that the U.S. government is&#13;
                       particularly interested in the Bank apart from, really, I mean, in a high-level sense. It&#13;
                       is interested in it as a sort of thing to monkey around for some other purpose. But you&#13;
                       know better than me whether that's true or not.&#13;
&#13;
                       So, who is it responsible to now? Good question. I don't know. It's a bit like, you&#13;
                       know, companies which have shareholders who are happy as long as their dividends&#13;
                       are increasing.&#13;
&#13;
                       WEBB: Yeah, sure. There are a lot of other examples. It's more the rule than the&#13;
                       exception, this sort of not responsible to anyone in particular in a large organization.&#13;
&#13;
                       KAPUR: But in a sense it's a governance issue also in international organizations.&#13;
                       It's supposedly, at least, impervious. If you are a politician in a democratic set-up. if&#13;
                       you screw up you are thrown out.&#13;
&#13;
                       KING: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
                       KAPUR: Supposedly. In a company, if the company does badly, you are thrown&#13;
                       out. You know, in the Bank, I think the number of cases where, you know, you really,&#13;
                       somebody screwed up a project or a program or anything, there isn't much that really&#13;
                       happens [inaudible]. Well, you know, it may not go up that high.&#13;
&#13;
                       KING: Within it? No, I don't think ...&#13;
&#13;
                       KAPUR: Because by the time you get the effects, eight years have gone, you know.&#13;
                       By the time you really see the consequences of a poorly designed or a project which&#13;
                       was, if you ...&#13;
&#13;
                       KING! It's difficult to compare it with other organizations, I suppose, but [ always&#13;
                       got the feeling that (with always obvious exceptions, you know) that merit had a&#13;

          -~           edging somebody out        is no damned good at all was slow, but I would say it was&#13;
""::!&#13;
i~&#13;
          C.D          reasonably sure. The process of edging somebody out decently and saying, "Well,&#13;

          ::::I&#13;

                       be a good idea if you looked around," that didn't, that didn't happen. I don't think it&#13;
                       happens very well anywhere.&#13;
&#13;
                       LEWIS: You must have thought about this, I mean, the point really is compared with&#13;
                       what?&#13;
&#13;
                       KING: Yeah.&#13;

&#13;
 KING: r don't-I wouldn't put it in the worst category with a lot of private&#13;
 organizations.&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: That's right. And certainly you compare it with governments, other&#13;
 multilaterals, you probably had the sense that it wasn't too bad, huh?&#13;
&#13;
 KIJIIG: I felt it was always, even in its worst conditions, a fairly exhilarating place to&#13;
 work because of the people in it. And I don't think--of course, we were fairly well&#13;
 paid, so there should have been some [inaudible] but I didn't think it lacked for good&#13;
 people, stimulating people of all kinds, at any time. I don't think that was the&#13;
 problem. I think the first thing I mentioned [inaudible] is that sort of--that may have&#13;
 changed. I don't know to what extent that has changed in the past ten years. But there&#13;
 ate a lot of good people there. Now [inaudible] they may have been.&#13;
&#13;
 WEBB: I guess Devesh means that "good" by what standards.&#13;
&#13;
 KAPUR: No, it's more a question of.-you know, I mean development is a sort of,&#13;
 it's a game where you think about alternatives by definition and in fact much more,&#13;
 simply given the ditliculties of the alternatives and everything else. But given that as&#13;
 it may, I mean, I've been always struck by the fact that, you know, if a government&#13;
 program goes wrong, literally, you know, some guys might lose their necks in&#13;
 [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
 KING: WeJl, take the Kenneth Kuanda case. That was really an instant disaster.&#13;
 There were riots, and they immediately stopped everything. And the minister, whose&#13;
 name I've forgotten, who was really the sole person, who was sort of almost by&#13;
 himself in advocating it within Zambia, was fired and so on.&#13;
&#13;
  Now, who was responsible? Was it the fellows who were actually doing the&#13;
  negotiating, whether in the Bank or in the Fund? Was it the director of the&#13;
  department? Was it the vice president? Was it the president? Or Ernie Stern in&#13;
  between? I don't think there was much ofa chance of getting a whole range of&#13;
  policies adopted in a country which was used to subsidizing the, you know, doing&#13;
  nothing for the rural areas and subsidizing cities, or a few ofthem, Lusaka and a few&#13;
  others. Tiltn that around with a sort of--and then reduce the exchange and free the 
&#13;
  exchange rate when the mindset of the country was just simply not, had really not 
&#13;
, been changed. I think you might say these people were being asked to do something 
&#13;
  which was intrinsically probably impossible in the way they were doing it, might have&#13;
  been impossible in any way. So who's to blame? Who are you going to fire?&#13;
  Conable? Clausen? Ernie Stern? And if the shareholders thought this was a dumb&#13;
  policy, why didn't they say so from the start? I mean, you know, this was the wayÂ­&#13;
  this was the way things were being practiced at the time, and they thought they could&#13;
  get away with it. I read, you know, almost all the reports issued anhe time ...&#13;
&#13;
 KAPUR: Even now in Match, when they sort of basically led from the right hand&#13;
 into the left hand, the Bank declared Zambia to be IDA eligible and then gave it IDA&#13;
 funds which were repaid back to !BRD. You know, if you see the story, I mean ...&#13;
&#13;
 KING: I haven't the slightest idea. There's no other way they're going to get their&#13;
 money back.&#13;

something. I may even still have it in my computer, actually-I'm not sure--but it&#13;
may be easier to Xerox it, page after page after page.&#13;

[Begin Tape 1, Side Al&#13;
&#13;
KING: ... really in recent times comes from the-made by this OED-you have it, I&#13;
think.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The one on ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: On the OED reset.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But that was done in '79, I thought.&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, no, no. It was done in something like '87, '88, '89--1 don't know. It was&#13;
done ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It was when you were acting vice president?&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, after that.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: After. I see.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah. I'm pretty sure. I could check it very easily. See, I interviewed a&#13;
number of the people in OED, and who, since they came from the rest of the Bank&#13;
were old project people, and they indicated, if I remember correctly, caveat&#13;
[inaudible] that there was first of all a domestic review by the project people&#13;
themselves, and then the OED reviewed that. And I got the impression rather strongly&#13;
that they didn't start trying to second-guess. It would have been very, very difficult to&#13;
second-guess the--what I would call the domestic-there is a technical term for it&#13;
which I have forgotten, which is in there--the initial review. And the OED review&#13;
was a review of a review.&#13;
&#13;
I asked for one oftne initial reviews, and--or one for a sample, a minimum sample of&#13;
one. And J think it was of a Korean power project or something like that, and myÂ­&#13;
excuse me; I'll just shut this door; the day of our cleaning lady, every Wednesday--I&#13;
would have had a lot of questions about it. They're not necessarily, though, earthÂ­&#13;
shaking methodological questions that I can sort of [inaudible] but Ijust said to&#13;
myself, "Well, what does this mean and what does that mean?" And I can't believe&#13;
that the OED has lime on a regular basis-maybe they do from time to time--to go&#13;
back and say, "Well, how did you do this?" If indeed the person who did it, the first&#13;
review, was still there or remembered and if he went back and really checked what&#13;
went on. So I find it difficult to believe that this process is anything but a rather sort&#13;
of impressionistic process, and the OED-I mean, I think that the OED people are&#13;
serious in what they do but they simply can't physically go back and check every iota&#13;
of what is in these initial reviews, much less the original project which is probably&#13;
where all tne notes are handwritten and when you move your office you throw them&#13;
out. So I agree with you.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
And that's why I came to the conclusion, much as Dennis DeTray has written, that the&#13;
notion of research on what the OED does is probably fairly limited, And as far as I&#13;
can see what can be got out of it is probably already being got out of it. perhaps the&#13;
orange has been squeezed a bit too dry. Many ofthese various studies of initial rates&#13;
ofreturn and final rates of return and transfer and econometric analysis ofthe&#13;
independent variables on this, that, and the other ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Let me-I'm finding it hard to get a handle on this, how in fact decisions are&#13;
made. I mean, {inaudible] what is needed is almost something equivocal ofwhen we&#13;
send an anthropologist to a rural village to observe ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah. Or it's a time and motion study.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KING: It might be interesting to take this, to do a case study, a particular project&#13;
where--and, of course, it goes back because with the programming process you decide&#13;
on Education IX or Railways IV about five years before. You don't decide what the&#13;
project's going to be, but you decide that you're going to do it. And presumably even&#13;
at that time there must be a vague idea of what you're going to do, and if you decided&#13;
to do Railways IV in 1993. it must be based on some conception of what is needed.&#13;
So the sort of reproductive process is a very, very long one. Paternity is going to be&#13;
very hard to ascribe. I don't know, it's ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: There's lots of issues, even in, you know, the donor group, if you go back&#13;
{inaudible] as of now almost 40 percent of {inaudible] lending is in social sector&#13;
lending and adjustment-type lending. And for both of these there is no theoretical&#13;
framework, even ofthe type or one that you can at least question and ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's a different question. This is not a project in a nonnal sense.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right, no, but say social sector ones are now, a project like education,&#13;
population, there are, you know, the rates of return or something like that are--the&#13;
rules of the game are very different.&#13;
&#13;
KING: The OED doesn't find, they don't find [inaudible] for those social sectors.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But even the people who actually do the projects, the initial ones, you&#13;
know, then you are not using Mirrlees to speak of like that at all.&#13;
&#13;
KING: I don't know how well that the Mirrlees ..&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well, he was even ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: .. how well it's been adapted.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Exactly.&#13;

KAPlTR: The average was disputed pretty strongly by [John B.] Knight and 
&#13;
[Richard H.] Sabot. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, Sabot is an ... 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I used to work with him. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah? Big shot. He's where? At Dartmouth? 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I met him a few years ago wandering around Washington. He was working 
&#13;
at a center; I've forgotten which one. 
&#13;
&#13;
But coming back to the projects, I wonder [inaudible1 what rates of return, what 
&#13;
they're actually used for? How did they come into the decision-making? 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: In a negative way. 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Just in a negative way? 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, the famous 10 percent cutoff. 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But I mean, for instance, [inaudible] I have the impression that it must cost 
&#13;
an awful lot it: knowing enough about a project, you estimate a rate of return 
&#13;
[inaudible] You have to have gone through an engineering exercise. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, you do anyway.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But you do for how many. for what horizon of projects, for one or two or 
&#13;
basically for the one you've already chosen. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, you mean for comparative strategies? 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And presumably what you're supposed to do is look at a hundred projects, 
&#13;
calculate the rate of return for each and look at the numbers. Now, I can see that one&#13;
could do back of the envelope ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, that I'm sure never happened. 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But any expert on irrigation projects or whatever has to be able to do that in 
&#13;
his mind even unconsciously. I guess what they do is look around, they'd have a 
&#13;
good sense but still it's only a sense. I can see that the rate of return is a sort of 
&#13;
discipline [inaudible] but how does it really work? I mean, there's so much leeway 
&#13;
here for things like you were saying, a decision made ten years ago to do [inaudible] 
&#13;
and what the minister wants. There are so many different things. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, I suppose a lot is influenced by the--when you say a hundred 
&#13;
alternatives ... 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Or eight.

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: There may be eight alternatives. But on the other hand the real alternatives&#13;
are those where some preparation work has been done in the country itself. and it may&#13;
be a limited number of alternatives. 1 don't know how the choice is made, even&#13;
among those limited ones. The choice may be that, you know, German aid has picked&#13;
up A, and French aid has picked up B, and C is for the Bank. But what-of course,&#13;
it's very difficult to say anything when one talks about this as a general question, you&#13;
see, which time, at which time?&#13;
&#13;
I think that~and I don't know to what extent how historically you're into this or not.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Very.&#13;
&#13;
KING: .. but I'd say the clearest recollection I have of this is probably when I was&#13;
Resident Rep [resident representative} in India when they did have--I remember a&#13;
team of two people from the project department of the day, whatever it was then&#13;
called, going out and going around India looking at irrigation projects and com ing&#13;
back and--with conclusions about which ones were quote "bankable" unquote (that&#13;
was the jargon ofthe day). And, as you say, it was based on a rough and ready&#13;
impression by two reasonably intelligent people and experienced people of what they&#13;
considered to be the best projects. Now, they hadn't done admittedly any very&#13;
detailed analysis ofthem, but sometimes you don't have to do that to exclude a lot of&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
J mean, J remember on the mission to Spain that J went on, we had somebody who&#13;
went around and picked up a lot of detai I about all the irrigation projects. That was a&#13;
three-month effort, and I doubt there was much-that's a,lot of--and we did in fact&#13;
calculate crude rates of return on them, I think. But this was not the run of the mill&#13;
project analyses.&#13;
&#13;
Whether the, in the actual Bank operational work, people were able to afford the time&#13;
to make these detailed comparisons is very doubtful. What I think is much more&#13;
attention is paid probably to sort of design once a project is picked. I mean, large&#13;
irrigation projects in countries, Thailand or whatever, tended to be the main focus of&#13;
the Bank's projects, and areas which are sort of one of a kind, and especially with&#13;
power, hydro dam, where it should be constructed and so on and so forth. And this is,&#13;
I suppose, how the issue of hydro versus thermal came into some prominence.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But I guess there are two other questions, and one is how are choices made&#13;
on projects between sectors and the other is within sectors. In a sense one can see that&#13;
it's not that one does a rate of return sort of on the universe of projects across all the&#13;
sectors.&#13;
&#13;
KI:-'G: No, it wouldn't have much meaning anyway.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And so you sort of say, well, you know, country X, Zambia, say in&#13;
agriculture, "Lending is minimal; that's the sector where most of the population is and&#13;
so on and so forth and we should stress that; so let's look for some bankable projects&#13;
in agriculture." However, the government of Zambia only gives, is, has its biases&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
against agriculture, so people will say to the Bank, "One is agriculture but two are&#13;
industry," or whatever. How are the dynamics of that negotiated? Tmean, because&#13;
there's a selection bias because every country has its own agenda which might not be .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I don't think that the country's biases control. It obviously had some, but it's&#13;
easier to discuss something that somebody proposes than something that they don't&#13;
propose.&#13;
&#13;
Again, I think that there's a difference in time. My recollection of the process when&#13;
there was kind of independent projects, as opposed to a projects department or&#13;
whatever linked to a region, was that there may have been much more tendency on the&#13;
part of the operational departrnents--and I speak to some extcnt from personal&#13;
experienceÂ·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·to, in the economic missions, to say, "Well, here are sectors where the&#13;
Bank ought to go in because it's a mess." Or this needs doing, or that needs doing.&#13;
And from the point of view of the economy as a whole, not on questions, not on the&#13;
basis of rates of return or whatever but on the basis--well, in a sense on the basis of&#13;
rate of return because in the long run you can introduce performance, do tbis, do that,&#13;
do the other. You could have more beneficial effects if you do it right than others.&#13;
&#13;
And the classic case that I know of in this instance was after I came back from the&#13;
Spanish mission, finished that report, and the Bank started to make loans to Spain.&#13;
The man who was in charge of this came in to me in a rather casual way and said,&#13;
"Where do you think we ought to start lending in Spain?"&#13;
&#13;
And without a great deal of thought to the matter I said, "We should start with the&#13;
railways."&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "Why?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Because this is the sector that needs it most." I said, "One thing you have to&#13;
know before you start is that you'll get [inaudible] because the railways lose money&#13;
like water over the dam, and people are going to say, 'Well, this is an entity which is&#13;
losing money, and why does the Bank lend for that?'''&#13;
&#13;
And to my surprise this is exactly what he did, and exactly what happened. And they&#13;
did make the loans. It did result in an enormous improvement in the running of the&#13;
railways, which were a mess under [Francisco] Franco. And probably in an&#13;
impressionistic way there was a high rate of return in terms ofthe improvements.&#13;
&#13;
But a lot then depended on the fact that there was an element of choice. [n other&#13;
words, if you were working on Peru, Thailand, Zambia, whatever, and you said,&#13;
"These are the sorts of projects we want to do," you could then kind offit it in with&#13;
the projects. My guess is--and it is a guess--that with projects departments coming to&#13;
a, under a regional or now country aegis, they all have to have something to do; and&#13;
ergo, the balance that they're talking about is predetermined by the size of the project&#13;
division.&#13;
&#13;
I--there was an OED report, one of their country reports, one on Sri Lanka. There's&#13;
an interesting small section about the Bank and agriculture in whicb they criticized&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
the Bank--rightly or wrongly--for trying to go and do projects there when a lot of&#13;
other people were doing them anyway. And you-or got the very strong impression&#13;
from this that it was-that what they said was the tip of the iceberg, that there was an&#13;
agriculture division which felt they ought to go and do something in Sri Lanka&#13;
because they were the agriculture division which was responsible for Sri Lanka and&#13;
some other countries, and they ought to go. But the more you decentralize projects, I&#13;
think, the more it seems reasonable to suppose that the more you pre-allocate the&#13;
sectoral division. But this would be something to check.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: This is the Bank [inaudible} a country focus even [inaudible J that we are&#13;
applying to the country and becoming more and more organized or reorganized or rcÂ­&#13;
reorganized to have a country focus, but Ii'om what you seem to be saying, are you&#13;
saying that entai Is the possibi lity of a danger?&#13;
&#13;
KING: WelL I remember David Knox, who was in charge ofthe Latin American&#13;
region before the reorganization. I don't know what happened between him and&#13;
ConabJe, but there are many stories about that. But I remember him saying about the&#13;
country focus that as vice president in charge of the Latin American region ifhe had&#13;
had railway engineers in a railway transportation group, if he needed them in Brazil&#13;
for three months he could use them and then switch them to Costa Rica and back to&#13;
Uruguay and that meant there was a great deal more flexibility. But he was saying&#13;
this from a flexibility point of view. What I'm saying--and it's reaIly a hypothesis, and&#13;
it's not a statement of facto-is that the more you decentralize and set up a bureaucracy,&#13;
the more the bureaucracy, the way you set it up, determines what you're going to do.&#13;
I mean, it would be very difficult for a country department to say. "We don't need&#13;
anybody on agriculture for the next two years. Why don't you send them over there?"&#13;
I mean, can you imagine this? It makes no sense bureaucratically. It might make&#13;
sense de facto, but it doesn't make sense bureaucratically. Well, J think the decisionÂ­&#13;
making process has changed with the organization. It must have.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It has changed coming [inaudible} there are cycles here within the regional!&#13;
country emphasis.&#13;
&#13;
KL"lG: I don't think that's a cycle. I mean, it's gone more and more and more to&#13;
countries ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You see it as a longer trend.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, I mean. it's gone from being purely project oriented to, a purely project&#13;
department, which was ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That was up to '72?&#13;
&#13;
KLlIOG: Yeah, whenever that was [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
'WEBB: There was no regional breakdown whatsoever in projects?&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, I would hesitate to go quite that far. There must have been--even if&#13;
there was no formal one, there may have been an informal one in the sense that if two&#13;
people had been working on India before, it would make sense, and it did happen, that&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
they would go to India the next time. I mean, that did happen. That certainly&#13;
happened but not necessarily a formal breakdown. And the--then you went to&#13;
regional with projects under regions; then you go to country departments with project&#13;
people under them and with a sort oftechnical department as a sort of pool-runner of&#13;
that work.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I mean, I'm curious. If you had very small country departments and large&#13;
technical departments in the region, then you could always draw upon that whenever&#13;
you needed it. But if the technical departments are small and the country departments&#13;
are large, then you get the sort of [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
KING: I prophesized, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
And then I think another thing which must have come into play also--it certainly came&#13;
into play in one major respect--were policy decisions of a very general character, like&#13;
McNamara and agriculture in Africa which was going to double or triple or whatever&#13;
in so many years. The effect of that, of course, does come out in the rate of return,&#13;
both if you take Africa and agriculture as independent variables, the difference&#13;
between the original rate of return and final rate of return or the semi-final rate of&#13;
return is that they come out as being rather important independent variables. And&#13;
there you definitely had a top-down influence on the distribution of projects. Now,&#13;
whether this has happened in the case of the environment ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Or social sector lending.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Social sector lending. I'm sure, I mean, that has to do with influence in the&#13;
Bank. If you're drawing up your program and the policy pronouncements from the&#13;
top that Conable or Mrs. Conable wants to have a good showing in X sector, by god&#13;
you make your program accordingly! Otherwise, you're fired!&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: So at least, say in the sense, the more general direction affects the&#13;
allocation of resources between sectors.&#13;
&#13;
KING: They must, they must. They must. And you-I mean, it might not-and&#13;
there's no reason to suppose this is the best allocation. These generalized statements-Â­&#13;
and I remember an article by Amartya Sen, of all people, about whether irrigation&#13;
projects were better, if irrigation was preferable to fertilizer or fertilizer to irrigation.&#13;
I mean, the notion that we can say one or the other is sort of crazy. I think this has&#13;
definitely had an impact.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Actually, we looked, I mean, in irrigation, large irrigation [inaUdible} is&#13;
extremely-trunk roads ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: In irrigation they're very, they're limited-large irrigations are obviously&#13;
limited by site, but the variations within the site may be considerable.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Maybe that's the case in general more than projects, the specific design of&#13;
projects, where you have a bit of options.&#13;

&#13;
KI~G:     Well, you have staging options, and I'm not talking about sort of engineering&#13;
questions as to whether you--how you build it, naturally, but those are fairly&#13;
[inaudible}, too. But I should think that things which do incorporate risk elements,&#13;
such as the height of the dam and whether you, if it's a site, when you build which of&#13;
successive dams along a river. And of course the major decisions usually get the&#13;
wrong answer, I mean, i"s how many do you start at once because there is no country&#13;
that I know ofwhere the sin is not committed of starting a large number of irrigation&#13;
projects in such a way that money is available, financial resources are available only&#13;
to complete them very slowly, and of course that produces a rate of return that's very&#13;
substantial. That was true in India. I mean, you know. it was Nagarjuna Sagar, which&#13;
took, I don't know, maybe it isn't finished yet: I don't know. Including the--it's not&#13;
just the dams.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Especially the canals and the distribution systems.&#13;
&#13;
KI~G: The canals. What happened, you see, you'd allocate money for staffing a&#13;
new dam and not give it tor finishing the canals on the one you already got. I don't-Â­&#13;
it was true in Spain, very much so, where they have a large number of ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But there--have you seen any evidence of the fact that the Bank's-again,&#13;
sort of going back to prqject analysis, in a sense--there seems to be implicit in this aÂ­&#13;
I'm not sure about this--offavoring new projects as opposed to financing projects&#13;
which are unfinished but which if you'd give it a nudge would ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: I don't know how true that is today, but I do remember very strongly having&#13;
arguments in--I mean, I don't know how long ago this was, not that long ago--with the&#13;
project people about the rates of return on projects and whether you included some&#13;
costs. And, you know, I was, others and myself were arguing, "Okay, they've spent&#13;
all this money." I mean, the reductio ad absurdum is if you need one dollar to finish&#13;
it, and it cost two billion dollars. it really doesn't matter that the rate is. It took quite a&#13;
struggle to get that across.&#13;
&#13;
The trouble with the independent projects organization--I think r commented on&#13;
decentralization, but in centralization you may get preconceptions which are hard to&#13;
move. But maybe that's changed now that people have come to know about&#13;
[inaudible} That was true in the early days of the Bank. that you would have an&#13;
engineering bias which--engineering and finance were biases as opposed to an&#13;
economic bias in the projects situation.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Now, wouldn't there be a lot more biases pushing in the same direction? In&#13;
a country you always have a big political bias that's more interested in creating&#13;
something new than in finishing the last president's projects.&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's true, and it's also true that there may be two reasons for this. One is&#13;
clearly provincial. If Orissa has one--but that's true of everything; fertilizer plants,&#13;
cement plants, steel plants, you name it--regional things, quite irrespective of-you&#13;
know. r remember going to Kerala where they had all the power resources ..&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Especially hydro.&#13;

&#13;
KING: .. hydropower resources you could think of, but couldn't get money to sell it&#13;
to Madras. I mean, to build it and sell it to Madras which would have been a logical&#13;
thing. They were probably building steel plants in Madras.&#13;
&#13;
But the--and the other thing is maybe in a bureaucratic incentive in, again, that there&#13;
are people whose job it is to design and job it is to go and look at--the extreme&#13;
example of that was in Spain where people's salaries depended on it. If you want me&#13;
to. I can dig out the reference in our Spanish report. We found that the system of&#13;
payments--there were bonuses for people within a certain department which were&#13;
based on the amount of new projects. I mean, this of course was crazy. I mean, that&#13;
must be an extreme example, but there may well have been other examples.&#13;
&#13;
"''EBB: You mean within the Bank? Or was this in the Spanish government?&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, no, the Spanish government.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: In the Spanish government.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, the salary business. They got miserable little salaries, and bonuses&#13;
were depending on ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Bringing in new projects.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, in some form. I can't--the formula I've forgotten but I can look it up.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And it's built into the Bank, too, [inaudible] projects to push lending even&#13;
before ...&#13;
&#13;
 KING: No, I think the Bank has been reasonably conscious of the need for&#13;
completion. I mean, I think that that has been a-I think what has often been hard to&#13;
do is to persuade governments that, because the pressures within governments are&#13;
totally different. I mean, the pressures, they come from the regional thing or it's a&#13;
political battle. That happens in every government--here in the United States it's&#13;
pretty obvious--that the political bias to do something in one part of the country or do&#13;
a particular type of project. You have a very gung-ho minister of railways, and he's&#13;
going to be saying, "I've got a roadbed to complete. These ministers, they're getting&#13;
contracts with the Bank." It's much more likely that they will be listened to, whoever&#13;
they are, than some people who are more passive.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah. In Peru in the '80s, early "80s, the Bank pushed, did a lot of pushing,&#13;
on the government accepting an irrigation rehabilitation project, bonds to improve&#13;
drainage, et cetera, in a number of areas. I don't know why, but it never worked very&#13;
well. Even so a second [inaudible] for a project was again really pushed. And I&#13;
thought that made all the sense in the world, and it was a perfect example of what you&#13;
saying. Here is the Bank pushing the government in that direction. Of course, for&#13;
twenty years before the Bank hadn't been-and how many of these rehabilitation&#13;
projects are there in proportion to new projects by the Bank. And I can't imagine&#13;
there is a country where [inaudible] by far the highest rates of return would come&#13;
from-in other words, there is a lot of room for that sort oftbing.&#13;

&#13;
KING: Yeah, welL I remember in Pakistan, I think, there was quite a bit of that sort&#13;
ofthing. But it tends to happen, doesn't it, when you start having salinization&#13;
problems with irrigation? I mean, that was certainly true in Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. And also because the dam had developed a crack, largest dam in the&#13;
world.&#13;
&#13;
KI::&gt;JG: Tarbela?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, that's an obvious kind of rehabilitation. That's the sort of punishment&#13;
type of rehabilitation.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That's practically a new dam, though, isn't it? A lot of money.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well, the thing is that here in the rush to get the concrete started before the&#13;
new monsoon or whatever ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: They didn't mix it properly?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Or the setting time. The concrete didn't-and this is by far the largest&#13;
scandal and I mcan--and so it did not set, and then for the next two or three years it&#13;
[inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I find that really interesting what you say because I'm just thinking a priori I&#13;
would have expected that a bureaucracy would--by its own logic--would push to&#13;
preferring new projects.&#13;
&#13;
KING: In the Bank or ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: In the Bank. It's appealing to do new projects, there's a lot of money&#13;
[inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side AJ&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side BJ&#13;
&#13;
KI::&gt;JG: The only way you could face it would be very difficult--not difficult, tediousÂ­&#13;
-to document this. And one would have to do it, I suppose, by going back over brief&#13;
descriptions of what projects were done, in annual reports or something, short of&#13;
going back and reading every project report [inaudible] But I do have the impression&#13;
there was always a very-a consciousness of the need to fix up as well as to do new&#13;
projects. The pressure for new projects came largely from the country's side. This&#13;
was true of the railways in Spain. I mean, Franco wanted to have a railway.&#13;
[inaudible] made no sense. The traffic was going over with trucks anyway. But the&#13;
idea of having a project, particularly a project that you couldn't open, you know, have&#13;
a headline in a paper--you can't have headlines saying we've replaced the turntable in&#13;
Zaragossa's yard and [inaudible] You must have seen that in Peru.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Under [Fernando] Belaunde.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: [inaudible] Belaunde.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Belaunde was an extreme example. I mean, he was building bits of roads in&#13;
the Amazon. Finally, I mean, when you had a hundred miles to connect two of them&#13;
you probably did have a high rate of return, but you had to have spent an awful lot&#13;
first.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: By the way, Belaunde--l often [inaudible] incredible case of unexpected&#13;
consequences, because he insisted on pushing the highway through the mountains, up&#13;
and dovm the mountains rather than ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's right. What was it called?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Marginal.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Marginal, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Marginal. And everyone [inaudible] nine months but in the end everything&#13;
came to a stop. I mean, mostly American, I think.&#13;
&#13;
KING: The U.S. government, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And he thought he got away doing this pilot. And in fact it opened up a&#13;
huge area for settlement, and so today now we're (A) destroying the jungle but (B)&#13;
it's all coca area.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Coca?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's where all the cocaine of the world comes from, 80% of the world's&#13;
cocaine.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And the Americans financed this.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah. But no one, no one was concerned with what today are the main&#13;
problems. But this is-what are you--I'm really interested in what you're saying. I&#13;
wonder ifthis recollection is principally, up through the end of the '60s, of using, if&#13;
you think this carried through the '70s and maybe the '80s.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, lthink it did.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Do you think this was a product, to some extent. of the sheer, say,&#13;
professionalism of these project people that are engaged in irrigation work? You send&#13;
these guys who are expert on railways, and they just, my god, they never see it&#13;
functioning well as a system.&#13;
&#13;
KING: I don't think. it was just the professional projects people. There was much&#13;
more interaction and decision-making on the part of the country, those people who&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
were in the country divisions. I mean, when I said the person responsible in the&#13;
Spanish case that [ mentioned, the person responsible, he was the head or at least the&#13;
chief economist, senior economist in working on Spain. He was not a project person.&#13;
[ mean, ifit had been left up to the projects, I don't know how it would have been&#13;
determined because I mean you're talking about inter-sector. I mean. you don't have a&#13;
railway man and an agriculture man going out together. But originally when they did&#13;
these sort ofeconomic reports, big or small, the bigger ones you'd have a few project&#13;
people along with you. I'm not talking about the massive studies that were done, that&#13;
were very popular at one time. Spain was one. Iraq was another. [was on the Iraq&#13;
one, too.&#13;
&#13;
And in the sort of discussion, as [ recall it, you would talk to people on a mission, and&#13;
talking to people on a mission is in many ways more profitable than talking to people&#13;
at the Bank, which was a wcll-known thing because they're honest, they're more&#13;
honest when they're out of the Bank; they're not influenced by the biases ofthe people&#13;
about them, you know. And they'd say, "Well, you know, what they really need in&#13;
this country is a better desalinization program," And you say, "Well, why don't we&#13;
say so?" Now, if you've sent them out to do projects and say you've got to do&#13;
Irrigation Proje&lt;"1 XIV, it's possible that they may recognize it, but for some&#13;
mysterious bureaucratic reason not emphasize it quite so much. This again, of course,&#13;
is my speculation. But if you have interaction with people on the spot. there would be&#13;
more tendency for doing these rehabilitation improvement projects and that sort of&#13;
thing. [mean, in Zambia, where they wanted to do a-again there was, the first&#13;
project I ever went on in Zambia, and that was way, way, way back--they had ideas&#13;
for {inaudible] We had an engineer {inaudible] and so on, and what he said made&#13;
sense.&#13;
&#13;
I think the-I think there was always, and I suspect it continues, this notion of&#13;
improvement has always been there. :\ow what would be interesting as a study by&#13;
itself-which I don't know you have time to do--would be the sociology of this. [&#13;
mean, maybe the projects in Peru didn't do much, didn't do very welL because the&#13;
bureaucracy there said, "Well, you know. this is just the Bank. If they want to give us&#13;
money for this, well, we'll do it." But they--you have to have some sort of enthusiasm&#13;
somewhere in the country for carrying projects out. If you don't, then it's going to be&#13;
a failure, and then they say, "Well, we told you so."&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: [also remember the Bank produced--one of the standard talking points for&#13;
Bank missions, it was always expenditure and maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
KroIG: Absolutely. I'd forgotten that. That has been--J can't remember when that&#13;
didn't occur.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And I think that this whole issue of government, government costÂ­&#13;
financing which is sort of somewhat related but not exactly to local financing ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: Very much related; there mllst be a high correlation.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. Is that--that used to be ...&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: A stumbling block.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, but people would find ways of getting around it. You'd finance&#13;
something wbich-you finance some imports which they were going to import&#13;
anyway and have a clause in a contract, a loan contract, which says that they set up a&#13;
highway with a maintenance department and--you wouldn't necessarily--I mean, the&#13;
fungibility for things also comes in here, too. I mean, you could get around that--not&#13;
always, but, you know, there were ways of getting around it.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Is it your impression on, say, highways, for example, education projects&#13;
where maybe the counterpart was [inaudible] for successful education projects, much&#13;
of the expenditure, overall expenditure ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, well, the local co-financing was a big obstacle at the beginning, but I&#13;
think the obstacle has been eroded very substantially. I don't know what the situation&#13;
is now with structural adjustments. After all, it is a total fungibility. And if you-Â­&#13;
well, you're right about the road maintenance,&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah, I've been curious about that.&#13;
&#13;
KING: That is probably the best example, I'm glad you mentioned that. That has&#13;
been going on for a long time, and it seems to be another chronic instance of the&#13;
political preference function for new projects. I mean, you could probably draw sort&#13;
of graphs or some ingenious fellow could do graphs and show whether [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: You said you--ofthe infrastructure, irrigation, hard-line transportation, I&#13;
mean, many of them involve these, even these infra~tructure projects were not really&#13;
new. I mean, like in India you have Railways, I guess, XIV now. But a lot ofit is&#13;
really taking the existing infrastructure left after the fact.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Indian railways is a big-,-a good place to--that was a very good example of&#13;
the disguise oflocal cost-financing. I mean, what the Indian railways project said was&#13;
we're financing imports of copper and--I don't know-&lt;iifterent pieces of minor&#13;
equipment which was the railway program of imports for the next five years. when in&#13;
fact the project was, the purpose of the project after agreement was reached, initiative&#13;
of the railways, was to make this, that, and the other improvement, to change the way&#13;
in which you arrange for trains to pass each other, you know, signal equipment,&#13;
because all the locomotives were built in India.&#13;
&#13;
KAPL"R: But, I mean, that's an example of [inaudible} worked well.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, well, it worked moderately well. I remember arguing that the Bank&#13;
didn't-lacked the beginning of [inaudible] with the railways, probably that may have&#13;
been diplomatically the right way to do it, {inaudible] we'll give you a couple to do&#13;
what you like and then you start [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's interesting. I hadn't even thought of this, but now I wonder--! guess&#13;
these "sons oP' projects must become vehicles for a lot of fixing up, conditions,&#13;
maintenance, and [inaudible] very important. You can see this to some example as a&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
kind of-they become vehicles for fixing up what you didn't do right the first time, but&#13;
it's-but more probably it is, it also means all kind of internalizing, building in part of&#13;
it. Proportionately a lot of it-maintenance, issues that wouldn't come up would be&#13;
harder.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Pricing. pricing, very important.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Pricing policies.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Pricing policies, which is a whole area where you always meet resistance.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Backsliding ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, that's right. Because the negative side of the piggyback projects is that&#13;
obviously the incentive to do a piggyback project is that the input/output--input by the&#13;
Bank of resources is so much lower. I mean, if you go and appraise the project and&#13;
you discuss the next phase at the same time, there's a--in an atmosphere which it&#13;
certainly was under McNamara--where the input/output [inaudible} this month and&#13;
this month and the input/output processes. And which werc--and these were not&#13;
figments; I mean, these were realities. There were all sorts of figures that 3.5 manÂ­&#13;
years was spent by this region and 3.2 by the other. The norms would be 3.0, and that&#13;
one was 2.7, so they were the golden-haired boys. Anything which helped to reduce&#13;
your input [inaudible] output coefficient was obviously to be encouraged in that kind&#13;
of atmosphere, which was also of course meant for the difficult projects. Small&#13;
projects were at a disadvantage, and that of course was the bad thing about it. As I&#13;
think I may have said previously, I mean, there was [inaudible} a million on a project,&#13;
but I had to do a 10 million project. But that's a different issue, really.&#13;
&#13;
'WEBB: In the end, I guess, I find it-I repeat that I find it very interesting, but&#13;
simple-minded deductions, logic, that you often hear, are not to share it--the&#13;
bureaucratic sense that particularly was getting started under McNamara. would push&#13;
the Bank in the direction of new projects. In other words, ifsomeone's share,&#13;
political bias on projects, what you're saying is that there was always, I think there&#13;
was more purist at the Bank. Maybe it was a mix of kind of engineering project area&#13;
professionalism plus the economic analysis.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, well, I think it--my guess is that this was probably the point at which&#13;
these sort of people who looked at things from an economic point of view, people&#13;
who looked at it from an engineering point of view, began to have a kind of contact,&#13;
you know. You'd say, well, the tendency--I may be doing them an injustice, but I feel&#13;
the tendency of the engineers was to be given, to feel that they were given a job to do.&#13;
You know, should we build this dam or not, is th is--and how to build it, and what are&#13;
the financial results going to be, and what crops are going to be grown, and so on,&#13;
railways, whatever. And the economists would talk to them and say--and would sort&#13;
of kind ofelieit what their real feelings were, "Well, I shouldn't be doing this at all. I&#13;
should be doing something else," And we said, "Well, then, we should do something&#13;
else." And I think this kind of interaction was probably one of the--may have been&#13;
one of the unexpected strengths ofthe Bank, that there was at least the opportunity to&#13;
look at the alternatives in the light of whatever you found out about a country.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Jt's the way in which economists actually make contributions by asking&#13;
these questions. You probably had very little of that going on in the country itself.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Virtually zero.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah. Probably because you never had economists involved.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, you did, but you see, I mean, in fact, I recall. in Peru you had all these&#13;
technical ministries and then you had a planning group. And the planning group was&#13;
totally dwarfed, even in India. When I was there I remember having--this was not in&#13;
connection with any particular project assistance--I was always pressing the people I&#13;
knew in the government and knew well, and I didn't have to tell them. I mean, it&#13;
wasn't that I was saying anything new to them, but I was sort of applying a kind of&#13;
personal pressure to people in the ministry of finance or wherever and saying, "Look,&#13;
why in the hell don't you get some--you've got bright economists coming out of your&#13;
ears in India and you don't know where to employ them. Why don't you put a few of&#13;
them in this ministry and that ministry and the other?"&#13;
&#13;
And whether my pressure had anything to do with it--and, of course, it's not&#13;
something I'll ever know--but they did. And I remember whoever it was-{K.S.]&#13;
Krishnaswamy, LG. Patel or whoever--coming and saying, "Well, now we've got&#13;
somebody in this ministry. See, we've done it." Now, I mean, but that was rare, and,&#13;
of course, there were not that many countries which had-who were churning out&#13;
economists the way they were in India.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Did you sense, or how do you see this change in ...&#13;
&#13;

Bank.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The interaction between the technical and the projects ...&#13;
&#13;
KL"IG: It's hard for me to say. I mean, I wasn't there. I couldn't tell.&#13;
&#13;
KAPt:R: At least, the technical people r talked to---l mean, they have a strong or r&#13;
don't think just a very strong feeling ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: What do they have?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In the sense of. you know, abilities to sort ofinteract or that they will lose&#13;
out. you know, in a bureaucratic part ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: [don't know.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: With the number ofthe, relations have also changed from--in the Bank in&#13;
the '80s and '90s, say '90s, means economists and financial analysts in the Bank&#13;
whereas the technical people, agronomists, you know, and it's-it's a change.&#13;

             August 14 and October 16 and 21,1991- Final Edited 
&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I don't really know. My impression is that the country people pay less&#13;
attention to projects than they used to. When I was working in an operational&#13;
capacity I always-I remember personally being very interested in projects. And&#13;
when I was in India, when project people came through, I mean I talked to them at&#13;
length, at length, and I went out even to look at projects, if there was a tube well&#13;
project in UP [Uttar Pradesh], and you'd learn a lot. And there was interaction.&#13;
Now, sometimes it was purely administrative, and the fact was, you know, because it&#13;
was idiotic the way the Bank behaved.&#13;
&#13;
They went to--l remember very well a very nice man who went to the port of&#13;
Calcutta. The Bank was very interested in the port of Calcutta--which incidentally&#13;
was very much more a rehabilitation project than anything else. And I'd say, "Well,&#13;
when you've been to Calcutta, you're coming back through, let's talk."&#13;
&#13;
And he found that the port of Calcutta had all sorts of problems with the central&#13;
government in India. Well, that's not unusual anywhere; everybody has problems&#13;
with central governments. And I said, "What are you going to do?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, I shall go back to the Bank and write a report saying that no progress&#13;
has been made because of red tape." That is almost literally true.&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "What do you mean? Why don't we straighten this out here? I'll call up&#13;
the ministry of finance and see my friend Krishnamurti [ph], and we can talk about it,&#13;
and maybe he can help." And we did.&#13;
&#13;
But the point of this story is not really:-this sort of thing, I think, happened a great&#13;
deal more. I think there has come a point in the Bank where oddly enough by&#13;
decentralizing the project activity you've in a sense isolated it. I don't know. This is-Â­&#13;
you'd have to talk to the people. I mean, I have a very definite recollection that the&#13;
project process was one in which country economists were vitally interested because&#13;
how else do you get to know, really understand, the economy. Not by reading, you&#13;
know, budgets and making models only; it's by understanding the way things are&#13;
working or not working.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In a sense, could one say that since country economists are so much or&#13;
more increasingly focusing on macroeconomic issues?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, yes. Well, the structural adjustment thing means, I get the impression,&#13;
that the emphasis on adjustment lending has meant that the country division is another&#13;
project division. It's a project division for structural adjustment loans, and you say&#13;
you have structural adjustment divisions or whatever version there are, you know,&#13;
technical adjustments, and then you have transport, social sectors and agriculture and&#13;
whatever.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Very interesting. I sensed that just recently. I was in Lima during the last&#13;
Bank mission, it's reopening up, at least Peru coming back into the world. And all&#13;
these macroeconomists were on the mission. There wasn't just one macro--I guess the&#13;
macro, but then there was somebody called the trade who had a macro [inaudible]&#13;
focusing on industrial, trade and such issues, but anyway there was financial sector&#13;
mission. There were at least three macro missions, and I'd never seen [inaudible] in&#13;

that way because I saw them functioning in a different way. These were all thinking&#13;
in terms of the project development and they were going to private issues for design&#13;
options and wanting to discuss the macro [inaudible] in terms of certain issues that&#13;
were important for them in actual projects. There were at least three people. They&#13;
weren't really the macroeconomists before of the Bank. They had a kind of more or&#13;
less-I don't know--[inaudible] overall perspective. But I guess this is very&#13;
[inaudible] Or maybe just in Peru it's-that it's five pieces of writing.&#13;
&#13;
KING: What?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: This kind of a macroeconomic exercise, a sort of new macro economist. As&#13;
you say, a project one. [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: One more list of, , .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Honestly, I think what you have to look for is certain features ofdesign,&#13;
standards of form [inaudible] absorbing an awful lot of attention.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Poverty impact and all that.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Oh, yes, we'll corne to that.&#13;
&#13;
KING: I wish I hadn't said it.&#13;
&#13;
\VEBB: It was on the list. Did I tell you my experience on this on Bank operations?&#13;
&#13;
KING:     No,&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: In '74 I was working at Princeton University. I had just finished this thesis,&#13;
which was about income distribution and governments, And I had done one mission&#13;
for the Bank in Guatemala. [Pedro-Pablo] Kuczynski, who was then succeeded by&#13;
[John A.] Holsen in Central America, hired me to go to Guatemala and spend a month&#13;
looking at everything that the government did and think about it from the point of&#13;
view of policy, So I wrote, I did that report. And then in '74 the Bank had asked me&#13;
to be part of an agricultural mission to [inaudiblel It was a weird mission because it&#13;
was three institutions, an experiment at cooperation between the Inter-American&#13;
Bank and the OAS [Organization ofAmerican States], so it was a large-ish mission.&#13;
It was agriculture, headed by an old-time, I thought very good, down-to-earth ag man,&#13;
a Canadian called Lome Sonley,&#13;
&#13;
KING: Lome Sonley! Oh, I know him very well--I knew him very well because he&#13;
was on the Spanish mission with me, and I invited him to come to India, and we&#13;
produced a report which was never published; it never got anywhere because it was so&#13;
scurrilous, called "Farmers and Indians."&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Do you have still have it?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Unfortunately, for some reason, I've lost it. I don't know. It was called&#13;
"Farmers and Indians," I wrote about a third of it, and he wrote the other two-thirds,&#13;
Yes, I know him very welL I knew him very well. I don't know if he's still around,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No. He left the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh. no, no. He's left the Bank, but he retired to, I think, a farm down in 50,&#13;
80 miles from here in Virginia, but I've lost ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Because he was Canadian.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, Lome was in charge of this mission, and when I arrived, you know,&#13;
[inaudible] terms of reference. And he didn't say this, but it was [inaudible] poverty&#13;
expert on these issues. Of course, they're on irrigation, new exports, et cetera&#13;
[inaudible] I had an idea and [inaudible] somehow a poverty map and then interact&#13;
with project people to discuss with them how their project design could alleviate the&#13;
poverty level. But I realized pretty soon that Lome hadn't a clue of what to do with&#13;
me or what I could do or how I could help. Absolutely no clue. He was a very nice&#13;
guy and we got along, but he was quite lost as to how I could be useful.&#13;
&#13;
KING: And very skeptical, if I know him.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Extremely! And I just didn't know how to handle myself with these&#13;
incredibly professional and [inaudible] totally, absolutely narrowly focused British&#13;
engineering specialists and so on, I mean, irrigation. These kinds of people, they were&#13;
so--they must have been on a hundred missions--that practically they'd had their&#13;
report written before they landed.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, they had a standard format, and they just have to fill in the numbers or&#13;
the name of the city.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: They knew-they worked-right away, they'd already, I don't know how&#13;
they decided or it was pre-decided. Somehow when they arrived they knew what&#13;
projects and how. And I just couldn't talk to them. I just didn't have the personality&#13;
to be aggressive. I realized afterwards that it was probably worse that I was pushed&#13;
into the mission and asked questions, really innocent [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
But I'll just throw in one more anecdote about Lome. He was totally frustrated on&#13;
that mission because of the environment in Washington [inaudible] and he was&#13;
caught in a [inaudible] He was very frustrated to make a commitment to some&#13;
[inaudible] And one day when we were having a snack, he told us, he said, "It's so&#13;
much easier working in Nicaragua because if something doesn't work, you call up&#13;
Somoza and tell him and he snaps his fingers, gives an order, done." That was one&#13;
year before he was overthrown.&#13;
&#13;
But I think this is just a preamble how-I think it somewhat fixed my view of the&#13;
Bank and poverty. I had a sense that at the project level-this is close to the midÂ­&#13;
'70s--the sense that trickle-down of all the learning must have been very slow and&#13;
very partial so that ...&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
KING: Except in one respect, I'd say, and that is that I think the trickle-down may&#13;
have been very, very partial, ending in a real trickle at the bottom in the context of a&#13;
particular project, but it led to projects being undertaken a priori because they were&#13;
poverty projects which means that you put the water on the worst soil. I mean, at its&#13;
extreme, you have the alternative to direct the water to the worst soil or the best soil;&#13;
but by definition the people who are on the worst soil already are the poorest, so you&#13;
therefore direct the water to the worst soil. Now, that is a simplistic example of what&#13;
happens in the process.&#13;
&#13;
There was, I think, that tendency, and of course it's extreme if you put a project in an&#13;
area where people are poor when in fact what they should do is justo-as a matter of&#13;
fact, this issue came up in Spain. And I remember Lome Son ley and I discussing it at&#13;
the time, because this poorest agricultural area of Spain is the so-called Meseta, which&#13;
is a sort of rather rocky and somewhat upland area in the center of Spain. And people&#13;
were being paid subsidies to grow wheat there because, you know, sowed the wheat&#13;
and people [inaudible} but it wasn't really the ideal place. The argument that we&#13;
produced was that there were plenty of places to grow wheat in Spain, and of course&#13;
the self-sufficiency problem because Franco was nervous about being isolated, and&#13;
that people were just eventually going too-there was no use trying to subsidize&#13;
agriculture on the Meseta because people were going to go to Barcelona anywayÂ­&#13;
which, of course, they did. That particular prediction, fortunately, which was a&#13;
difficult one, came out right. And, you know, ifyou'd--and they had this colonization&#13;
institution which poured money into a particular area and, largely because it was&#13;
showplace, and the poverty issue there arose independently of the Bank. It was before&#13;
the poverty kick, McNamara's poverty kick, began. So--but the distortions which&#13;
occur because you direct money at poor people because it's a policy matter on the&#13;
counsel of, you. know, what distortion the Bank prefers, either in countries or in the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
The issue of poverty is much more complicated and difficult than just throwing out&#13;
the statistics of how many poor people you've helped, which again raises the way the&#13;
books can easily be cooked and probably were. Zambia is a very good example, you&#13;
know, that there the issue of poverty arises if you have any kind of restructuring in the&#13;
Zambian economy. The initial effect is to create a lot of poverty in the big cities, in&#13;
the urban areas. But, I mean, that is not the fault of the restructuring; it's the fault of&#13;
the previous structuring, I mean, but it doesn't look good, you know, social adjustment&#13;
costs and all that jazz.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What you say about the Meseta, that's exactly the issue in Honduras. I guess&#13;
everyone finds there is some highlands where you have the smallest farms which you&#13;
can say are the most backward.&#13;
&#13;
KING: The hill farms in Italy.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The hill farms in Italy.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: West Virginia.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: All the Andes. All the time we're speaking, "Well, this is where we've got&#13;
to put money." That mission in Cabo [inaudible} experiment, the project officers&#13;

&#13;
talked about [inaudible} doing anything there. It was obviously totally out of their&#13;
minds. It's just as Son ley said in Spain, "Why put anything there? The people have to&#13;
move out of there. Nothing will work there." This must be very strong [inaudible}&#13;
hierarchy, but the programming .. ,&#13;
&#13;
KING: But I think that, ,&#13;
&#13;
{End Tape 1, Side BI&#13;
{Begin Tape 2, Side AI&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: .. how much of it was really translated into a [inaudible} and I can see the&#13;
programming and creating new boxes that have to be filled and you could see some of&#13;
this [inaudible} in areas of Africa, but you could have that going on. The question is&#13;
whether the other, the part that isn't being moved by these reprogramming, changed,&#13;
is getting there in project design, all kinds of smaller choices that will really only&#13;
come about if the division chiefs, the project officers are very much re-motivating.&#13;
Hard to get any broad sense of that.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Have you talked to van der Tak?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No. He's around?&#13;
&#13;
KING: He's probably the best person to do that. First of all, he's retired. He's been&#13;
concerned with projects for a long time, I mean. even when I was in India J&#13;
remember he and somebody else came out and wrote a paper about irrigation projects&#13;
in India and choice on that. I don't have the paper any longer, but J remember having&#13;
a letterthat I wrote back to Washington saying that I went for a meeting with project&#13;
people--I mean, J can dig the letter out if you are interested--saying that these project&#13;
people seemed to be, have a closed view of what Herman and the other fellow&#13;
([inaudible), I think it was) were saying. He probably has the longest knowledge of&#13;
what went on in the project business of anybody I know, and he's in Washington-I&#13;
mean, he's in Washington when he's in Washington, He travels a lot, but I would say&#13;
that this was an absolute must ifyou're interested in projects.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: He wrote this paper, I guess it was one ofthc first formal ones on the&#13;
economic analysis of agricultural projects in 1965.&#13;
&#13;
KING: He did, did he? I didn't remember that.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I just, in fact, saw it last evening.&#13;
&#13;
KIl'\G: Now, that may have been the one I'm talking about.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That might be, I seem to remember that it was '65&#13;

&#13;
KING: Yes, because I left India in '65, and I think that probably was based on his&#13;
visit to India. 
&#13;
&#13;
Who else do I know that could shed light on it? Somebody who might, might be 
&#13;
helpful--I don't know if he's in Washington or he's in one ofthese overseas posts--is 
&#13;
not nearly so long, but is Tariq Husain. 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yes, he's back here. He used to be the Res Rep in Nigeria?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah. I've always regarded him as being an intelligent guy. How much 
&#13;
project work, but he's been in these overseas reps. He was in Nigeria, I think.

&#13;
WEBB: Oh, that's right. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: He and I worked together for about a year when the new urban projects 
&#13;
department was started. It was my only time I was ever in a project, when there was a&#13;
big, big project department.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Was the urban projects sort of really started by Richard Westebbe?&#13;
&#13;
KING: No. No. Richard Westebbe was a sort of peripheral writer on the subject,&#13;
but J don't-I think he was a sort of--I don't think he-oJ wouldn't expect to rank with&#13;
people talking about that. If you want to talk about ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In his oral history he says that he started in ... 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: In urban? 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, he wasn't even in the urban projects department. He may have been-he 
&#13;
was one of the first people--when interest in urban projects. urban things. was started 
&#13;
in the Bank, he was certainly, he certainly was active in that. 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: This is the urban projects department before the central    proje~'ls   urban? 
&#13;
Wasn't Jaycox the ... 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, no. This was long before that. 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Long before it.

&#13;
&#13;
I left there, the projects place because, over an argument with--a friendly argument,&#13;
but a philosophical argument-with [BernardI Chadene! and [Warren C.I Baum, who&#13;
were running il.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Really?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah. It was an interesting one. Maybe 1 should mention it because we had&#13;
a--it was called a special projects department--not urban--and it had two functions.&#13;
One was urban, and the other one-no, there were three. The second one was to deal&#13;
with the floods and irrigation (floods, I guess) problems of what is now Bangladesh,&#13;
and the third one was the Mekong Delta. I had nothing really much to do with the&#13;
other two--something, but not too much--althougb my job was, really covered the&#13;
whole three. I had more interest in the urban side.&#13;
&#13;
We had three people in the urban division, and the head of it was a Frenchman, who&#13;
by his name was obviously of North African descent, and a very volatile Englishman&#13;
named Gabriel Roth, who is still in Washington as a consultant and who wrote a book&#13;
on paying for roads. published by Penguin, and an American engineer named Don&#13;
[Donald AJ Strombom. who is probably still around. And the Frenchman, whose&#13;
name will come back to me one of these days. and Roth were at loggerheads from the&#13;
start because Roth was an economist who had written frequently and had very strong&#13;
feelings about paying for roads for people and doing--he analyzed things from an&#13;
economic point of view, anything that you were doing. 1be Frenchman was an&#13;
engineer from the Paris municipality or something and his qualifications were really&#13;
quite good, but when you asked him how you would justify from the economic point&#13;
of view a peripherique around Paris, he said, "Well, it's obvious you need it."&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Substantial economic analysis.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes. "It's like," you know, he said, "you know when we decided to introduce&#13;
the new rubber-tired trains," or whatever it was that they have in the subway there,&#13;
which are very nice.&#13;
&#13;
I said, "What kind of analysis?"'&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, we decided this was a good thing to do." I mean, you know, that was&#13;
his attitude.&#13;
&#13;
And obviously these two didn't mix at aiL And we had a tremendous controversy.&#13;
really erupted over a Sao Paulo peripherique. and the Frenchman said, "Well. of&#13;
course it's necessary." And Roth produced all sorts of arguments as to why it was a&#13;
tremendous waste of money, that really what you wanted to do was to find some way&#13;
so the trucks could go round Sao Paulo instead of going through the middle of it. In&#13;
other words, you didn't have to build a peripherique to do that. You could do a-Â­&#13;
whatever.&#13;
&#13;
So there was this big argument, and one would come and talk to me for an hour, and&#13;
the other one would come and talk to me for an hour. And I said finally--well, they&#13;
wanted to build a metro in Sao Paulo and god knows what. So I said. "Well, instead&#13;
of going back and forth like this, let's have a meeting with the people working on this&#13;
&#13;
                             Benjamin B. King

&amp;#12;                                                                                        50&#13;
&#13;
Brazil." It's myoId nature that's, you know, you get as many people as you know&#13;
about the country and put them together and see what you find out. So we had the&#13;
meeting. And it turned out that-I said, "Well, you know, I have view A and I have&#13;
view B, and we'd Iike to hear what you think about these things."&#13;
&#13;
In the meantime I'd asked for some consultant reports which was, like many&#13;
consultants' reports, justified the beltway because they thought that was what W'llS&#13;
needed, and they, you know, valued the time savings of truck drivers on the Sao Paulo&#13;
beltway at about the same salary as the head ofthe Brazilian national bank.&#13;
&#13;
And so we had this meeting, and it was not very flattering to the Frenchman's point of&#13;
view. And he evidently complained, and I had a discussion with Warren Baum and&#13;
Chadenet. They said, "Well, you know we don't really like to wash our dirty linen in&#13;
public. We have to settle these things within the department before and reach a&#13;
position before you can talk to the people in the country." I'm not exaggerating at all.&#13;
&#13;
I said, "I'm sorry. I don't think that's the way it ought to work." And I said, "If you&#13;
insist on this, that's not what I'm going to do. I'd rather find another job in the Bank."&#13;
I said, "It seems to me that if you want to come to a decision, you bring--instead of&#13;
reaching a mini-decision and then presenting it as a fait accompli or at least your&#13;
initial negotiating position with somebody else, you discuss it."&#13;
&#13;
I couldn't believe it. I was naive. I should have believed it. I knew enough about the&#13;
place too-that I should have known this was possible, but I couldn't, I couldn't~what&#13;
[ found difficult to understand was the seriousness with which this view was&#13;
presented, you know.&#13;
&#13;
And I don't think this isn't an irrelevant story because it does illustrate some ofthe--it&#13;
has an interesting bureaucratic connotation that when you create a fiefdom, a sort of&#13;
little empire, it is possible for this to happen. [still find it very peculiar that if you&#13;
have an intellectual disagreement among people, you don't share it instead of&#13;
"resolving it," in quotation marks, and the only way of resolving it is to come down&#13;
on one side or the other, and when you hadn't got the facts, what facts were relevant&#13;
from other people. And many of the things that the people from the Brazilian country&#13;
division had to say were relevant.&#13;
&#13;
So after they offered me another job in projects as a sort of senior economist in&#13;
projects, I said, "What do you want me to do?" So that is the story. I turned that&#13;
down, too.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Have you found that continually in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Y cab. I don't think it's peculiar to the Bank; I'm afraid not. ['m sure that even&#13;
when I was there in 1987, I went to meetings, I had the sense, a bit of a sixth sense,&#13;
that, you know, people were coming to meetings as representatives and, you know,&#13;
[inaudibleJ would say one thing and Shahid Husain say another, and you had a&#13;
feeling they were playing roles.&#13;
&#13;

was--my reaction when this happened was, "Well, that's nice, That's a breath of fresh&#13;
air in this stuffY room," But I would not say it was the [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [inaudible} Yesterday John and Richard addressed the 1818 [SOCiety/.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, I didn't go because this was the day my wife was leaving, Otherwise I&#13;
would have gone in,&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And so you call into question, I mean, I'm asking was the [inaudible} of&#13;
the planning and budgeting, Richard's role, so much ofthe Bank is, if you were going&#13;
to look at that But if you remember originally someone raised this thing up, how you&#13;
are going to look into this phenomenon of empire-building, the fact that over time sort&#13;
of the fiefdoms and empire-buildings had become more pronounced in the Bank, He&#13;
did not state it as a hypothesis but as a fact or as a statement.&#13;
&#13;
KL~G: I don't know whether empire-building is more-it's fierce, of course. When&#13;
[MoeenA} Qureshi started after the reorganization, his front office was going to have&#13;
two people, but then-and that was one of the purposes of the reorganization. But,&#13;
you know, it immediately got a large sort of policy division, and then it got something&#13;
else, and so on,&#13;
&#13;
No, I think what may be even more serious than the empire-building--because after all&#13;
that is in a sense theoreticaHy controllable by persons who can say, "No, you can't&#13;
have those positions; you don't need those two"--is protectionism. The kind of&#13;
protectionism I'm talking about, that you--and that is why it was, I suppose. it was&#13;
much easier to talk to people of a different, quote, "nationality," unquote, I mean in&#13;
terms of the empire, on a mission because, you know, you were having a beer before&#13;
dinner and maybe something with dinner and conversation would tlow and people&#13;
would tell you about the awful way people behaved back home. their bosses. They&#13;
wouldn't have come to you about it back in Washington, You know, "I write my&#13;
report, I say this, my supervisor changes it, and what can r do," or "He sits on it for&#13;
three months," or "He spends hours editing it and changing it" But this protectionism&#13;
and the sort of, the imperatives that would come down from the top of the empire to-Â­&#13;
not so much to protect the turf, I think, but to protect his reputation in the eyes of his&#13;
bosses, you know, sort of-that's not peculiar to projects.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right r mean, I was really wondering earlier that if you had that sense&#13;
when you create or review these minutes, that the debates, at least--well, I don't&#13;
know--in the sense of it seems to be about scoring points with the others, especially&#13;
with the four, five, or sixes than sort of leading to what this new schema for the&#13;
country ought to be.&#13;
&#13;
KING: It's a bit like some performance theories.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. It's noi {inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yes, you-that waS a very much {inaudible} certain words are thrown in.&#13;
You get away with certain terms used to characterize something, then you achieve&#13;
what you undoubtedly, or get advantage, even without attacking it frontally. It can be&#13;
something totally unfair and not really that relevant, the characterization. There's a&#13;
lot of that. But this anecdote suggests to me that maybe some ofthe cultural&#13;
nationalities in this process. Have you ever sensed that at all in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, [mean every nationality--no, [don't think it's-this type of thing has&#13;
very little to do with nationalities. I mean, I mentioned Tariq Husain, who's a&#13;
Pakistani, who I have a high regard for, and there arc some Pakistanis [ have no&#13;
regard for at all. And, you know, there's the range. Of course, people do have-I&#13;
mean, nationalities have their cultural characteristics, I mean, that's for sure, but I&#13;
think that ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: There's so much filtering.&#13;
&#13;
KING: I don'I-J think that nationalities differences had very little to do with this.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: How is the sort of, more than quality of technical work, enormous amount&#13;
of, the breadth of how people do their work--how is that being changed in the relative&#13;
increase in the number ofYPs or do you think it's changed? Do you think it's had any&#13;
effect, or not really?&#13;
&#13;
KING: I don't know. The YPs have always struck me as being a much greater force&#13;
for good when they were YPs than when they became vice presidents. Do you think&#13;
that's unfair?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well, I guess--I'm rather in support of Richard against this [inaudible} I&#13;
think it's systematic, the YP program {inaudible} perspective.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, did it?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yes. In a sort of--a little bit smug and in fact, you know, in a survey of&#13;
managers, you know, 80% of managers felt the YPs had excellent writing skills, 78%&#13;
had accelerated in their first ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, with very few exceptions, most YPs that came into the Bank were very&#13;
bright.&#13;
&#13;
K.4.PUR: Right. And then it had, it went down, and then it had a footnote that said,&#13;
"However, only 31 percent of the managers felt the YP /inaudible} about&#13;
deve lopment."&#13;
&#13;
KING: As a YP?&#13;

                  KING: When he came in?&#13;
&#13;
                  KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
                  KING: Oh, yeah. That I think was also true. I mean, there are the continual&#13;
                  complaints that you can hear from people who, ahaut the YP mafia, you know, old&#13;
                  hands versus YPs. Old hands know a great deal. They know what makes things tick,&#13;
                  they know this, they know that. The YP is very, very smart. He comes and he thinks&#13;
                  he knows it all. This is the classic kind of dichotomy. I think that it may well be true&#13;
                  that YPs when they have come in and get sent out on small missions, they write&#13;
                  something and it probably doesn't-,but then who's to blame them? I mean, they've&#13;
                  come in. They've never been to--they may have had no experience with developing&#13;
                  countries at all.&#13;
&#13;
                  But I, my experience with YPs when they were arriving was pretty good. But then&#13;
                  you have to kind of keep them under control. I mean, you know, people who can't&#13;
                  deal with it because they're not familiar with what the YP is trying to say and are able&#13;
                  to say, "Well, you know, what you say may look sensible to you, but ... " But if they&#13;
                  can't sort of argue with the YP, people who are not able to argue on the same field or&#13;
                  level as the YP, obviously would find difficulty with it and there would be a nonÂ­&#13;
                  communication and, you know, "He's just a stick in the mud," from the YP, and "He's&#13;
                  just a smart-assed little brat," or she.&#13;
&#13;
                  And that, I've heard people make that complaint, sometimes, from people who&#13;
                  justifiably feel inferior to the YPs. I mean, the person really is inferior, and therefore&#13;
                  it can't really be blamed on the YP mafia, but ifsjust the fact that he or she doesn't&#13;
                  quite measure up.&#13;

place, was it?

&#13;
KING: I know the case extremely well because I was-you see, when I came in back&#13;
in 1987 it was right after Anne Kreuger, and Deepak was still there. and there were a&#13;
lot of controversies still hanging over. Deepak Lal and I didn't see eye to eye.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well. I must say I was {inaudible] sent me to this conference in Mexico.&#13;
And Anne Kreuger had started these four projects, and Deepak Lal said his-he was&#13;
in charge ofthe welfare. and he said that ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: On poverty.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. And he had some framework of looking at the whole thing. which&#13;
had to do with labor, with countries which are labor surplus and not labor shortage.&#13;
And according to this classification only Singapore and Hong Kong are labor surplus.&#13;
India and Bangladesh {inaudible}. !Iiterally gave up.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Counterintuitive.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I literally gave up after that. I mean, you can then basically. call anything&#13;
anything.&#13;
&#13;
KING: I gather.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I was a part of that project as related to Peru.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
WEBB: It was called growth and ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The political economy of growth and ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The whole idea was to {inaudible] rather more thoughtful. to be some&#13;
compilation, the long view, start thinking about what we called an umbrella picture of&#13;
a country' s development. After that amount of time {inaudible] country studies&#13;
{inaudible] After a good two years or more of it, we were all supposed to be merging&#13;
{inaudible] we had accomplished. but Dcepak provided the summary.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Was this in Morocco?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: 'lo. Maybe it was there. There was a meeting in Morocco, yeah. I can't&#13;
remember which ofthese meetings-oj think it was later in Washington that came out&#13;
with this--no, it started before-it came out with this-he'd seen an article&#13;
somewhere. maybe it was in the Wall 5,'treet Journal, and he sent me a clipping of&#13;
this, that this was the paradigm for the whole project. And it was clearly felt. I&#13;
couldn't even begin to understand the article, the paradigm, and how anyone could&#13;
make anything on the basis of that statistical exercise, so crude, so rough. Well, I&#13;
mean, it's fun to play around {inaudible], but I couldn't see how you could throw out&#13;
two or three years' worth of thought and so many countries. It was sad, you know, the&#13;
fact that ...&#13;

KING: Did I think the Bank has made a difference in any country if the Bank had&#13;
never been there, and, if so, what country? Well, I don't think it makes any sense to&#13;
say what country because you really-Â·Â·-this is a comparative matter, and J certainly&#13;
don't know what the Bank has done in all countries. But I think I have a different&#13;
answer, which is I think the Bank makes, has made a difference in most of the&#13;
countries where it is, in its initial contact with them. J don't mean the very first one; I&#13;
mean in the interchange which takes place between the Bank and the country, the&#13;
country learns things which are--like the maintenance question, you know. I mean,&#13;
things which--not everything it's learned may be good, but I think much of it is good,&#13;
and that I would have thought would ma'ke a difference. And somebody-oj was&#13;
talking about this at a party we went to recently with Jack {John D.] Schilling. Do&#13;
you know Jack Schilling?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: If you have a chance, he's a thoughtful guy, And I told him of this question,&#13;
and he made an interesting comment. He says, yes, he thought my answer--thc&#13;
answer I'm giving you now-was correct, but he said, "You must remember that there&#13;
may be more than one beginning." In other words, weI!, let's take Turkey, There was&#13;
a long interval--or Indonesia or whatever, Ifthere's a sort of interval in which a&#13;
country sort of regards the market-Burma is the best case now, maybe after the&#13;
Nobel Peace Prize--there may be a new beginning in which things happen within the&#13;
government as a result of the Bank, I mean, Bernie Bell you mayo-about Indonesia,&#13;
Now, I mean there was the "Berkeley Mafia" which came in there, but it's probable&#13;
that the Berkeley Mafia on their own wou Id not have sufficed, that you had to have an&#13;
interaction between the Berkeley Mafia and the outsiders and so on and so forth. And&#13;
I think that's--apart from the--Ilhink thai's probably where the Bank makes its&#13;
principal contribution, and that is not to say il doesn't make some contribution&#13;
afterward, It depends on the-it very much depends on the condition of the country.&#13;
It must make--it may always make some difference but not sufficient that you can&#13;
point to some [inaudible} Bul I think that is the most important difference, the place&#13;
and time when it's [inaudible} rate makes a difference,&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I'm not sure--when you say in a country, rather than a single regime or a&#13;
particular historic opportunity?&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, what I'm saying is that, well, take Bunna as an example--thc extreme&#13;
example, Bunna has more or less sort of cut itself off. Well, there was a time when&#13;
the Bank was acting in Bunna. I mean that's all gone; it's all forgotten, I mean, if&#13;
there were a new regime, if Aung San Suu Kyi did come back and come into power,&#13;
then she would need help in [inaudible] and I think the Bank would probably play an&#13;
important role at the beginning,&#13;
&#13;
Now, as the government becomes more sophisticated and more used to this, it needs&#13;
the Bank less, I remember going to Nepal at the--not absolutely at the outset of the&#13;
Bank's activity in Nepal, but close to it, And it was once when 1 was in India and I&#13;
went up there and a couple of limes subsequently. And [inaudible} and so on. And I&#13;
talked to the minister in charge of irrigation, and they were all very nice [inaUdible}&#13;
Even jfthey disagree with you, they hate to say it and you have to sort of encourage&#13;
them to disagree with you. I was there one year, and we talked about something. I'm&#13;
not sure what it was--this big problem of the canals and the Indian government and so&#13;
on and so forth--and I came back a year later and we talked to them again. And I said,&#13;
"How about that problem?" whatever it was.         '&#13;
&#13;
"Oh, yes," they said, "We really need you to come back every year to remind us" or&#13;
something.&#13;
&#13;
I said, "I should be very glad to come back every year in the fall." Katmandu in those&#13;
days-I don't know what it's like now--was a rather agreeable place, with a yak and&#13;
yeti bar or whatever. Have you been to Katmandu?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yes, I've been. I did some work for the ADB !Asian Development Bank],&#13;
I was-it was one place that was even more corrupt ...&#13;

KL~G:    .. Africa. Have you read Tropical Gangsters?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, I mean, it's a-I mean, how do you do something in that kind of an&#13;
atmosphere? You have to have some modicum of willingness to cooperate, if you&#13;
like, and I think what the Bank is able to do at best is to, is probably just to sort of&#13;
bring people into the same room, either physically or mentally, in countries.&#13;
&#13;
I remember on an early mission to Ghana-unfortunately, the report got lost--but at&#13;
the time there was a very serious belief, that is probably still there, called [inaudible]&#13;
in the cocoa industry. The cocoa industry was the main, was the principal export&#13;
from Ghana, and one of the things we looked at was we went--there were only three&#13;
of us; in those days they didn't have a projects section--but we tried to investigate&#13;
what was happening in cocoa. And what we discovered was nobody knew. But we&#13;
also discovered that there were sufficient people in Ghana to put together a picture of&#13;
what was happening. There were these people working here, these people working&#13;
there, those people working there. And we did bring them together into the same&#13;
room, and in the report, which is now lost, we had a map showing what was going on&#13;
in every area, what was likely to happen.&#13;
&#13;
And it's a bit like the economists in the ministries in India. I mean, India can hardly&#13;
be called an unsophisticated country, I mean, in, you know, it had K. N. [Kakkadan&#13;
Nandanath] Raj and god knows who in all these universities, but somebow or other&#13;
the impact wasn't there, although he did a wonderful report on the steel marketing&#13;
business, as I recall. And I think the Bank may often have and certainly could have&#13;
this sort of influence, but it goes to finding something--I don't mean, you know, what&#13;
are the latest statistics on revenue collections from tourist visas, from liquor licenses&#13;
or something, but in a sense making the government aware of what it knows.&#13;
&#13;
I think--my favorite example of this is something which I initiated myself. It&#13;
bappened once in the history of the Bank. After the Bank had had a number of&#13;
meetings when I was working on India, before I went to India, meeting with the&#13;
Indian consortium, I said, "Why do we do reports on India? Why doesn't the Indian&#13;
government do it? They're perfectly capable of doing it." And it happened once.&#13;
They presented the report.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Do you remember the year?&#13;
&#13;
KING: It was in the '60s, I think. I honestly don't remember.&#13;

&#13;
KAPUR: You left in '65,&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, but it was--I don't think it was when I was--well, it might have been, it&#13;
might have been. It was one ofthe years--it could have been just before I went; it&#13;
could have been just after but more likely when I was there or just after because I&#13;
went back to the department of South Asia after that. I think it was, I think it was-J&#13;
suspect it was after because I continued working on India through about '67, '68,&#13;
something like that.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I think there's no question that there's a lot ofthat--it could be interesting to&#13;
try to capture some of the sociology that go along with missions in the Bank. There's&#13;
a bit of a doctrine there, that calling by the Nepalese, "You should come back every&#13;
year."&#13;
&#13;
KING: Just to remind me. I mean, it was a ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: [inaudible] It's a shambles on the ground. and day to day the Bank imposed&#13;
a certain external system or schedule.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Or self-examination.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Self-examination or whatever you're surrounded with.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And also you forced a decision to get together and talk generally by being in&#13;
the Bank's. the offices in the Bank in Washington. They don't talk to each other. But&#13;
the same government here [inaudible] plus the frictions, little frictions ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: Sometimes not so little. either.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That's true. The Bank comes and it's, as you say. it creates a forum,&#13;
everything--it's a unique exercise. The Fund does something along that line, but it's&#13;
much more ..&#13;
&#13;
KING: Formal.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: .. formal and private and limiting in scope.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Very limited, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I hadn't thought ofthat, but I'm sure that's a big part of the problem.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Particularly with what the Bank does [inaudible] Bank's sort of increased&#13;
role, especially when they seem to sort of do diplomacy. And they sort of--everything&#13;
and more regarding the Bank and, you know. between the country and the other&#13;
donors, eo-financing and all this stuff, environment, so you have to be a diplomat.&#13;
But what you're saying is that that sort of action ofdiplomacy was always there, and&#13;
in fact, within a country the Bank was ...&#13;

&#13;
KING: Yes, the other donor part of it came in considerably later, I would say, and I&#13;
don't know whether that was sort of diplomacy-I mean, it's like the dual role of a&#13;
university president, part of the job is fund-raising. And you have to he a--to be a&#13;
university president doesn't just require academic prowess so much as it does a&#13;
combination of, preferably a combination ofthat with fund-raising skills, And not to&#13;
raise quite too much, as we found out at Stanford! /Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yes, that's a very good analogy to raise too much for Europe, particularly&#13;
when they can run away with it.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: They're very cautious in the Bank now,&#13;
&#13;
KING: The Bank could--whether it would be able to-I mean, theoretically the Bank&#13;
could playa fantastic role in Eastern Europe, but whether conditions will permit it ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The IMF seems to be invited very directly to playa big role.&#13;
&#13;
KING: I think the IMF should. I think that ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And there is also EBRD [European Bankfor Reconstruction and&#13;
Development] that is expecting to playa big role.&#13;

[Begin Tape 1, Side All&#13;
&#13;
KING: .. to what we think there were and so on. And the first item on that list was a&#13;
talk given to the professional staft: of whom there were not very many at the time, by&#13;
the Vice President ofthe Bank [Robert L. Gamer] on the reorganization in 1962.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Would you have that?&#13;
&#13;
KlI'iG: Yeah. I have--everything which is there I have ..&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Okay. Great.&#13;
&#13;
KING: .. there, unless I have made an awful error. And in that reorganization he-Â­&#13;
which, you know, established three area departments or you would now call them&#13;
regions, in which Europe, Africa, and Australasia were all in one department--he&#13;
propounded the philosophy that the Bank could be excused to make a loan which&#13;
wasn't repaidÂ·~ifyou want to; in case you need one [referring to food]--but it couldn't&#13;
be excused for financing a bad project, which is an interesting thing that ...&#13;
&#13;
The--technology was something the Bank should be able to cope with. Now, of&#13;
course. this leaves out of account a lot of things like market questions and questions&#13;
of whether farmers are going to respond in the way expected and things like that. But&#13;
basically it was a sort of the view that, the financing view, that one should be able to&#13;
build, that one should damn well be able to build a power plant properly, and the&#13;
Bank could not be excused for not doing that, whereas, you know, there might be a&#13;
revolution in a country or some disaster of some kind, and you might, the loan might&#13;
go into default, and that was not something that the Bank necessarily would. could be&#13;
blamed for. So this was--I mean, it was very clearly stated.&#13;
&#13;
The--there was another paper, which you might not find in the pile. It was a paper&#13;
done on the Bank by a man called John Williams (who is now dead) in 1967. which-Â­&#13;
he was very good--and it's a pretty fair description and it has, you know, organization,&#13;
loans, that sort of thing. But he more or less repeats this thesis--Iet me see what he&#13;
says. But he does--and this is 13 years later. "Responsibility for judgments about the&#13;
merits of individual projects was deliberately divoreed from the responsibility for&#13;
judgments about the desirability of lending to particular countries or borrowers. The&#13;
responsibility for economic work was brought together with all other elements in&#13;
arriving at lending policies'" And what he says, which is interesting. is, "Divorcing&#13;
project responsibility from country and borrower responsibility built into the&#13;
organization of the Bank a limitation on the possibility that a defective or&#13;
inadequately prepared project would be pushed through because there were felt to be&#13;
overriding considerations arising out of the Bank's relations with a particular&#13;
country." Now that point I don't think was in the original piece by Gamer.&#13;
"'Conversely a project could not be passed through merely because it was fascinating.&#13;

&#13;
The Bank thus protected itself simultaneously against the technocrats and the&#13;
diplomats,"&#13;
&#13;
He had a good turn of phrase, And, hut he does--il's interesting that he says, "While&#13;
the benefit, of this division have a hidden cost in accentuating problems of&#13;
coordination at the working level and securing consistency, each subsequent review of&#13;
tbe organization has concluded, on balance, that the costs were worth bearing," That&#13;
is ajudgment which clearly, since this was written in 1967 just before McNamara's&#13;
reorganization, a few years before it--was it 1972, [ think?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
KING: That view was obviously not accepted, My own--I have a lot of these&#13;
references, refer to the problems of so-called coordination, and I think that, on&#13;
balance, they probably outweigh, I don't agree with this judgment. I think that was-Â­&#13;
--it was--I think there was a--looking back and rcading the sort ofthings that I wrote&#13;
when I was in India and a few other things, there were constant complaints, constant&#13;
complaints that, about problems with the role because of this division. And also, at&#13;
the same time, while I was in India, I came back to the Bank and gave evidence&#13;
before a committee set up called the End L'se Committee, which was about end use&#13;
missions on projects, and spelled out a number of the problems that arose, which we&#13;
can go into, if you want to.&#13;
&#13;
So then McNamara's reorganization came, and it was the Central Projects Staff and&#13;
the project people in the regions. My own--my guess is that this was probably the&#13;
best organization, I think I last, when we last talked, ..&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, you mean before the--before McNamara?&#13;
&#13;
KING: No.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: After '72?&#13;
&#13;
KING: '72.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KING: And the last onc is probably--both the extreme versions, the current version&#13;
and the earlier version, had their faults. I was talking--I happened to call somebody&#13;
who is now in the Bank, the man who now heads the Staff Association, , .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Chris Pare!.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Chris Parel. I asked him about the hypothesis that I put forward last time that&#13;
jf you have a very small unit with project people in the division, And, oh. yes, he says&#13;
it's true, because we talk about supply-driven programs, meaning you have a supply of&#13;
people to work within a country department or-and that becomes the content of the&#13;
program,&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I suppose their expertise [inaudible1&#13;
&#13;
                             Benjamin B. King&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, I'm not talking about whether they have the expertise or don't have the&#13;
expertise, but I'm talking about ifthere are eight men, people in an agricultural&#13;
division, they find work. And ifthey find work, they look for projects. So it looks to&#13;
me as though the intermediate position was probably the best.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the last reorganization, Conable's reorganization, was, you know, sort ofbuHt&#13;
on a shibboleth. And, you know, country--it was the great word at the time, the&#13;
buzzword, was "country-focused." But it doesn't seem to me--you need--you can't&#13;
have a country focus and still have a grouping of sector people within a region which&#13;
is fungible. And this was the point that I mentioned that David Knox apparently is&#13;
said to have made.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah. Vh-huh.&#13;
&#13;
KING: All right. You don't-you could have a number of project type people,&#13;
certainly project economists or something in the country departments, but this notion&#13;
that you have to have groups in each department, it seems to me to be false.&#13;
&#13;
One ofthe problems with the old, earliest division between the technical staff and the&#13;
regional or area departments, as they were called. was--and this comes up time and&#13;
time again, this kind comes up, I mean--was that the people who did the work, the,&#13;
you know. the front-line soldiers, first of all, they would write things and they would&#13;
tell the truth-l mean, not all of them, but to a large extent--and then what they said&#13;
would get emasculated, and the word "emasculated" appears several times here. And&#13;
there were all sorts of delays where what they wrote got changed and went up the line.&#13;
Now why this happened and in what way it happened, I don't know. ] was not privy&#13;
to the process. And I never, while in the short time I was working in the projects, I&#13;
didn't know of any clear-cut case, except the one I mentioned to you last time about&#13;
reaching a departmental consensus before you talk to anybody from outside, which&#13;
seems to me a rather pathologica] reaction to the ...&#13;
&#13;
But what people were trying to achieve in this and why they differed ITom--why they&#13;
wouldn't let the people from the field say what they had to say, I don't know. I mean,&#13;
obviously they had a--they had some kind of preconceptions Or they had some kind of&#13;
defense mechanism. Who knows? It's some sort of organizational problem. I just&#13;
don't know.&#13;
&#13;
Because I knew, when I was in India, about this--it becomes very clear that! met&#13;
these people and got to be reasonably friendly with them. And [ got-I was able to&#13;
sort of get a view of whether they were making, what they said made sense or not--!&#13;
could have been wrong--and they used to tell me what went on because [ was in the&#13;
field and they were away from the center and they talked to me about it And I--it's&#13;
interesting that when I gave this evidence in 1964 to this so-called End Use&#13;
Committee--and I have a copy ofthat--they asked me twice to name the sources of my&#13;
information, which I refused to do on the grounds that it was given me in confidence,&#13;
you're not supposed to--they didn't say that this was in confidence, but it obviously&#13;
was. And if it came--if it got back to somebody that Mr. Mitchell, or whatever it was,&#13;
is out there shooting his mouth off to this subversive character, he'd be in trouble. I&#13;
was quite certain of it.&#13;
&#13;
                             Benjamin B. King&#13;
             AugU$t I4 and October 16 and 21,1991 -- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      64&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So you had this bad situation of people who were actually looking at the project being&#13;
overruled in their reports. I don't know what--certainly toning it down or making-Â­&#13;
and also big delays. 1bere was one occasion where [inaudible] a three months delay&#13;
after the man had produced his report. And this didn't make--this was not a very good&#13;
situation as between the two sides in the Bank, the regions and the projects side. And&#13;
I don't think I'm exaggerating, because I have a letter from somebody else when I was&#13;
in India.&#13;
&#13;
The reason I have so much on India is because, of course. I was writing. If one is in&#13;
one's head office one doesn't write. One just goes in and says, "Right, do [inaudible1&#13;
bunch ofjerks." And whoever you are talking to says, "Yes, they are, but what can&#13;
we do about it?" And that's all that happens. But if you're in Delhi and you're all&#13;
steamed up, you write a letter.&#13;
&#13;
And the other thing which was wrong also was they very often had no idea, had no&#13;
training and no attempt at sort of informal training about how the economic situation&#13;
of the country affected what they were doing. And, of course, and the onc way this&#13;
cropped up in India, where most of these examples come from, because the rupee was&#13;
clearly overvalued at the time I was there, and there were issues of procurement of&#13;
things within India or outside. And they just went by the book. And, as I point out,&#13;
you know, thc rupee must have been overvalued by 50 percent or something or in that&#13;
sort of order of magnitude. And the--i f they wanted to, the things they'd procuredÂ­&#13;
this was an issue between procurement outside and procurement inside. It obviously&#13;
went--you don't use a one-to-one--you don't use the ordinary exchange rate.&#13;
&#13;
That was another problem. But that was not--it was not unique in the sense--that sort&#13;
of, that example of the problem was not unique. I mean, what was also a problem was&#13;
that they simply went to the project authority, they tended to, the staff would, and talk&#13;
to the project authority and went back and in many cases never went to the central&#13;
government, even that part of the central government which was concerned with their&#13;
sector, for example, I mean, irrigation. And I know one case where somebody did&#13;
because, I mean, I kept saying to all these peop1e--1 went to the CWPC--that's the&#13;
Central Water and Power Commission. And I said, "And tell them, you know, what's&#13;
going on and see what they say." And CWPC was very interested, and on the one&#13;
occasion when this happened, said, "Well, we'll do something about that:'&#13;
&#13;
And I was a great advocate, rightly or wrongly, of delegating to some extent the&#13;
overseeing of projects to big outfits like CWPC where they could, you could say,&#13;
"Well, let them do some of the work for you. You can pop in from lime to lime and&#13;
go around with them." But the logical thing, I thought, was to take somebody from&#13;
the C\VPC with you and see what, and go together and get them to do a lot of the&#13;
work.&#13;
&#13;
There was a very curious--and I've completely forgotten this until I read this, re-read&#13;
this--therc was a very curious philosophy in the Bank to start with, which somehow&#13;
reflected the banker/client relationship. And one ofthe people on this so-called End&#13;
Use Committee kept saying to me that the Bank must not get mixed up in&#13;
management. Management--a banker lends money, but he doesn't try and manage.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Well, of course, this is in retrospect rather ludicrous because, I mean, what is&#13;
management? If you discover that things are going very badly, you're bound to get&#13;
mixed up in management. And the Bank has been mixed up in management-Â­&#13;
certainly was mixed up in the management of economies, and it has subsequently&#13;
certainly gotten mixed up in management of projects, and with good reason in many&#13;
cases.&#13;
&#13;
In other words, there was an old philosophy which has hung over and it was still&#13;
existing in 1964, I mean, it was being trotted out as a--exactly what it meant in&#13;
retrospect is not at all clear. But, [ mean, it certainly was there. And how it related to&#13;
the sort of suggestions J was making, I don't know. I [inaudible] about it, but he&#13;
obviously felt rather strongly about it. because he kept mentioning it.&#13;
&#13;
The other thing which comes up from time to time, also, is the emphasis on projects,&#13;
and not only in projects department, is that people--to take an example--williook for&#13;
good, quote, "good projects," unquote, in a particular sector, irrigation was one oftheÂ­&#13;
-is the best documented example, I mean, even if it's not the best one. [think it&#13;
probably is. You go--ifyou're a project person, you go to India, and you go and you&#13;
see--you're concerned with irrigation. You go around to all the projects. You go to&#13;
Sam. You go to Parambikulum. You go to Salandi. You go to Nagarjuna Sagar, the&#13;
whole bit. And you decide that if you have-they show you eight projects, that four of&#13;
them are quite bankabJe--or five. And you think that there's no justification for three&#13;
of them at al1, that the way they're being undertaken doesn't make sense and so on.&#13;
So what do you do? You go back and say, "Well, we have five irrigation projects that&#13;
we can finance," But you don't write a report on the other three other than to say&#13;
briefly they're no good. And you don't, as I think you would in a region, the&#13;
discussion of the irrigation sector and how it's run and how it's--how such--what it is&#13;
that means that they do, that some ofthe projects are no good, and whether you&#13;
should say something to the government, express your views on the, on this, that was&#13;
not what they were supposed to do.&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, you'd have the regional plan, would write economic reports and&#13;
might comment on this in a general way--and I have even a quotation from an&#13;
economic report where this observation is made, again. by this region. And--but there&#13;
was no marriage. There wasn't sort of--because there wasn't the material. I mean&#13;
there wasn't sort of chapter and verse on why Parambikulum or whatever was, should&#13;
have been, was a bad project, why they were going over, what was going on and why&#13;
it was going on and what one might have to say about scetor policy.&#13;
&#13;
So I think that tended to fall between the stools because of this division, and it was&#13;
just not foreseen that there was such thing as a sector policy because you go and IookÂ­&#13;
-you have a project department that's concerned with projects and a regional&#13;
department which is concerned with--it may look at irrigation policy in a general way,&#13;
but if you can do it in a general and specific way by getting, by using the experience&#13;
of people--now I think it probably did. But, I mean, the--because of, you know, there&#13;
were dotted lines. Personal relationships were good. You would certainly have that&#13;
sort of thing going on. But the mechanism didn't encourage it. It meant--it was a bit&#13;
like samizdat in Russia, I mean. it depended--or the [inaudible] in China. It was&#13;
connections, you know, and deals--and sort of--but the organization didn't encourage&#13;

&#13;
it. And I think that must have changed quite radically with the 1972 reorganization.&#13;
That was the good thing about the reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Do you know-I have two questions, and one is that at least for recent&#13;
[inaudible] in the late '70s or early '80s, the Bank in a sector began to finance rather&#13;
than projects--for example, irrigation in India--began to tinance time slices of&#13;
investments. So the state ofGujarat has for the next five years in its plans to invest X&#13;
amount of money in the irrigation sector. And the Bank says, "We'll finance sort of a&#13;
fraction of that."&#13;
&#13;
KING: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Was that--do you sort of, can you recall anything from that sense because&#13;
that might force an analysis of the sectors?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, yes. I think it was a logical development, but there's one big proviso:&#13;
you would have to separate out those cases--and this is difficult to do--where this was&#13;
a genuine attempt to review the sector policy and in a sense to have some negotiation&#13;
with the government concerned about sector policy and on, from those, on the other&#13;
hand--and these are stereotypes of both sides of the question--where a sector slice was&#13;
a quota quickie. It was just a way of doling out the money and fulfilling the program&#13;
without going through the agony ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Of a kind of program loan?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah. Pseudo program loan. And how you make a distinction between&#13;
those, because it would require sort of rather ad hoc examination ..&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
KING: .. or else talking to somebody who was extremely familiar and (A) with it&#13;
and (B) prepared to tell the truth.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Sort of--a second thing, which is do you, I mean, if the goals of the 1972&#13;
reorganization [inaudible1..&#13;
&#13;
KING: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: .. done by McKinsey [McKinsey and Company] but really McNamara had&#13;
the whole, more or less, at the time. And they did what essentially what they were&#13;
told to do.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, that's the--that's all in the process.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But the '87 one, who had it, both the image or the sort of image ofwhat it&#13;
should look--as well as the process of how it should be executed. Was it Conable or&#13;
was it the consulting firm or did the task force?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, the consulting firm, by repute, was a crummy consulting firm. I have a&#13;
document or two they produced and they're not--they're not what would encourage&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
me to employ them, They had the reputation of being specialists in staff reductions,&#13;
you know, choppers and procrustean types.&#13;
&#13;
The task forces came up with this country process business.&#13;
&#13;
I would say I don't think Conable had a clue. I don't think he had a clue of much of&#13;
anything, but based on my [inaudible]. And I had--and the reason I say that is&#13;
because I had several, not many, but a few, one-on-one conversations with him, Once&#13;
he invited me to lunch with him [inaudibleJ And we had lunch, and I came out with a&#13;
very positive impression. The only time he showed real concern was if you&#13;
mentioned a name or if you mentioned somebody without mentioning the name, he&#13;
would ask the name. And that stirred his interest. And he would ask about people.&#13;
He was a Congressman, And he was--but organizational questions, I think he was--in&#13;
the abstract, shorn of names, he didn't-Â·he wasn't interested, So I don't think anything&#13;
like that came from him,&#13;
&#13;
I don't think the consultants had much ofa clue of the sort ofthe questions we're&#13;
talking about.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Okay,&#13;
&#13;
KING: And I think the impetus came largely from the task forces. You have to&#13;
remember--I think to what extent this, and how it influenced them, is not very clear,&#13;
but they wereÂ·-one ofthe dominant features of these task forces was that they didn't&#13;
like Ernie Stern. And Ernie Stern had been the sort of super region man and had a&#13;
very--a very--exercised very centralized control. I mean, he's a very intelligent man,&#13;
but there were times when he obviously went too far. And there were also times-Â­&#13;
there also was--the typical organization ofthings--where, again, people would have&#13;
ideas turned down, I can't remember-you told me. you gave me a good instance of&#13;
this--because somebody would say, "Yes, but Ernie Stern wouldn't like it," without&#13;
necessarily knowing whether he would like it or not, because I know Ernie reasonably&#13;
well, and I think he has a much more open mind than people think. But when he&#13;
disagrees. he disagrees very strongly and makes people feel that, like that.&#13;
&#13;
So this is one of the dominant features of the task forces, but exactly why it led them&#13;
to the country focus I don't know. It's possible that they thought that by doing this&#13;
you would eliminate some of the control of whoever was running this and--J don't&#13;
know.&#13;
&#13;
\VEBB: Kind of popular revolt'?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, I would think there are people whom you might ask who were on the&#13;
task forces. There are several people you can ask, talk to, One person who was&#13;
definitely angry with Ernie Stern probably was Jaycox, and another who was&#13;
definitely angry with Stern was Armeane Choksi.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
KING: A more dispassionate observer, and I think this is an honest one, would be&#13;
Johannes Linn,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Oh, he was a member? 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: He was member of one of the task forces, The same one as Choksi, and it 
&#13;
might be interesting to get the two separate views. r would--I'm quite sure Armeane 
&#13;
really many times said it to me, but Armeane's views were very much colored by this 
&#13;
antagonism. A lot of people resented the way Ernie ran the thing in what they 
&#13;
considered a very dictatorial way. And it was not without justification by any means, 
&#13;
but it certainly must have colored people's ideas. 
&#13;
&#13;
And they took this decentralization idea to the most, to great extremes, including the 
&#13;
decentralization of personnel, which was a terrible move. And this was a subject of&#13;
my conversation with Chris Parel beeause he's been writing an article about that. But&#13;
it's symptomatic of the personnel office and sort of being somebody who can go and&#13;
talk to an independent [inaudible). Now whcther he's any good or not or whether he&#13;
can do anything or not, you could, if he was in the personnel department, consider&#13;
him as a disinterested person, reasonably, with any luck. But ifhe's under the, your&#13;
vice president, and you think the vice president is screwing you, r mean, you know,&#13;
are you going to get a sympathetic hearing, if you're very lucky?&#13;
&#13;
But I think there wa~ this-but I'm sure it was the task forces that ... 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That came up with the structure. And on that, let me ask you .. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Huh? 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: .. whose idea was the process of this?      r mean, you had this memo on the 
&#13;
reorganization. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: The process? You mean the process of how it was done? 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: What about it? I mean, I've said it all. 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: No, but who was the source? Whose idea was that? Was it again, .. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I think it was again the task force. 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Even the process? 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Even the process. 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The task force seems to have had several prongs.

&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Right.&#13;
&#13;
KING: And there were some things on which--McNamara was on this. And there&#13;
were some things on which he had--I can't remember what it was, but I could look it&#13;
up--he had a very strong dissent on one of their proposals, but you can look that up,&#13;
you know, in their report. And I think he was right about it, but I can't remember&#13;
what it was. I remember thinking he was right at the time.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Mm-hmm.&#13;

lining canals when it wasn't really necessary.&#13;

WEBB: This-yeah--and we got into this question of standards and this suspicion&#13;
that the Bank has over ...&#13;

KING: Over. Over?&#13;

produce that result, inadvertently, of course?                     .&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah. This is pure speculation. My guess is it may have done it. It may&#13;
have. I think the Bank may have been better than--may have been somewhat bettcr&#13;
than other donors. I think that the U.S. government was probably worse.&#13;
&#13;
I remember going through the plants, the three stecl mills in India. Rourkela, Bhilai,&#13;
and Durgapur-isn't that what they were called?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
KING: And there was a German, a British, and a Russian. By far, the simplest ofthc&#13;
lot was the Russian. You know, it worked much the best. The Americans came in&#13;
with another one which was called Bokaro, which never got built or at least--it may&#13;
have gotten built.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: No. [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KING: And that was probably the most technologically advanced of them all at the&#13;
time. It was probably quite the wrong thing. But I think that people in the Bank--it's&#13;
a bit like malpractice with doctors, you know. If you didn't put in the canal lining and&#13;
something happened, you were to blame.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KING: But if you did put it in, and it wasn't necessary you weren't to blame.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KING: I mean, if you carried out this test, nobody could say you didn't do it or--but&#13;
it was not, you know, the cost of a test, which costs $10,000, was hardly worth it in&#13;
your case. I mean, you know, the chances are one in 10,000 that you-that this test&#13;
was going to be positive. Why do it? But then it turns out that had you had it, you&#13;
would have been positive, you could sue the doctor and get a million dollar judgment.&#13;
So the doctors do the test. And there is always that. But, I mean, in a sense, that is a&#13;
sort of, you know--and it excuses it to some extent.&#13;
&#13;
Whether this was consistently the case, I don't know. And it is entirely possible that&#13;
the project man might say, "We don't need to line this canal." And then he was&#13;
overruled because the man at the top was damn well not going to just have a project&#13;
without the canal lining. But I--but this is the product ofa dirty mind. I don't know.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 KING: Who did you talk to?&#13;
&#13;
 WEBB: No, I just remember it from the time I was here. But what strikes me is--l&#13;
 have this impression that the Bank--and this is an exeeption--that the Bank has had&#13;
 extraordinarily little intcrest in itselt; in researching and studying itself.&#13;
&#13;
 KING: Tell me. Not only that, there was-and this came up a number of times, to&#13;
 my recollection, when I was in the projects because I did raise it-that information (of&#13;
 course this was before the days of computers, because the Bank's first computer was&#13;
 about in the latc '60s, the first mainframe computer) but the information about rather&#13;
 simple elements of projects were not in any way tabulated. And the only way you&#13;
 could ever get information would be by the infinitely laborious process of going back&#13;
 through the project reports. And it's never, never done a very good job on that. I&#13;
 don't think it does today.&#13;
&#13;
 KAPUR: I guess the sense that one had from this person we talked to, said,&#13;
 especially when you were the division chief at the regional or one of the large country&#13;
 desks, to really execute that region you always need, you know, where you need large&#13;
 consu ltant~ [inaudible] or whatever and that these consultants have had strong&#13;
 influences on the way the Bank has actually executed these different projects.&#13;
&#13;
 KING: Oh. yeah. I mean, how else would you expect it ...&#13;
&#13;
 KAPUR: Sure. But that would inevitably, perhaps, lead to greater gold-plating,&#13;
 standards which are sort of a different ...&#13;
&#13;
 KING: What I don't know to what extent the Bank would argue with consulting&#13;
 engineers. I think it did. I think there waÂ£-I don't think the Bank necessarily&#13;
 accepted consulting engineer's reports and said, "Oh, yes, you know, the Madison&#13;
 case, you know, this is a good project and I don't need to write a report." I don't&#13;
 think it simply-Â·Â·Â·youÂ·d read. one would read the consulting engineer's reports, and I&#13;
 think they probably discussed it, but what this process of consultation and how well it&#13;
 was done is very hard to say.&#13;
&#13;
 "''EBB: As you say, it's the only way to go, a lot of nitty-gritty ...&#13;
&#13;
  KING: Yeah. I mean, if you have to, if you build a dam, you know, you have to have 
&#13;
. quite elaborate concern with what the rock is, what tiase it is. what shape it should be. 
&#13;
  And I remember when the Bank financed the Kariba dam, which was the dam on the 
&#13;
  Zambezi, I mean there was a French engineer who was, you know, sort of god&#13;
  almighty [inaudible1on arched dams, and the Bank insisted that he be hired because it&#13;
  was a big dam and a huge capacity and there we wanted to get it right. I think the&#13;
  Bank does try to use consulting engineers intelligently, but one always makes&#13;
  mistakes.&#13;
&#13;
 KAPUR: How do you see~~1 guess it's the bigger side--how do you see that story&#13;
 what happened with the Bank, the sub-contract, the [inaudible1contract, the thirtyÂ­&#13;
 year contract, I mean, between Alcan or Alcoa [inaudible] the Zambezi dam?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, no, there's nothing to do with th~no Alcan--the dam which was built&#13;
to supply power for aluminum was in Ghana. Volta River. Yeah, 1 happen to have&#13;
been involved in that, too. Both of them.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: 1 mean, this role of the Bank in sort ofhclping the LDCs negotiate such&#13;
contracts. Was there any role?&#13;
&#13;
KING: 1think so, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: There was.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah. There certainly was-I mean, I remember writing about the Volta&#13;
River project and to what extent, what the costs and benefits to the country were in a&#13;
crude way.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I seem to recollect that there was a fixed rate contract for thirty years&#13;
[inaudible1industries.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, that I didn't know whether it was a fixed rate.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That caused enonnous-you know, the energy prices shot up.&#13;
&#13;
KING: I don't know about that one. I don't know about-the fmal project was done&#13;
after my time, but I went there when the project was being discussed and promoted by&#13;
Mrs. Barbara Ward, Sir Robert Jackson's ...&#13;
&#13;
It was a very interesting project. There were a lot of issues, and I don't think the&#13;
Bank-but whether it had anything-I do have a--I remember writing a memo about&#13;
it, but I don't think, I don't remember the issue of fixed price. Thirty years? That is&#13;
very extraordinary.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: There was a report released by [inaudible] dam from the highlands of&#13;
India. It had some figures, which we haven't quite checked. The Bank has financed&#13;
10 percent of all lands.&#13;
&#13;
KING: In where?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: India (inaudible] one-sixth of the portfolio, excluding the figures for water&#13;
and sewage.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It wasn't clear, though (inaudible] versus numbers of projects or all those&#13;
numbers.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: All ofthem. Right. Exactly.&#13;
&#13;
KING: It's much more likely to be the volume of lending because a dam's--dams are&#13;
very expensive.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Maybe the small dam is [inaudible] percent oflending. I didn't realize&#13;
how much-it's become a more intriguing and more controversial aspect.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: What? Dams? Oh, well, that's-this is because ofthe environmental&#13;
question, Nobody had heard of environment questions in those days.&#13;
&#13;
But I remember back, we financed a dam in Norway, in which I was involved, way&#13;
back then. The Bank didn't make loans to Norway for very long. And the&#13;
Norwegians had a, oftheir own accord, without any prodding from the Bank, kind of&#13;
as part of their own legal system, had in a sense an environmental impact ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, it was more concerned with people than muskrats and, you know,&#13;
dolphins or things like that or owls, but there was an elaborate process Jed by people&#13;
with the [inaudible] and very-obviously with a very keen regard for the equities.&#13;
But then most Scandinavians [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: As opposed to a lot of other Bank countries.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The--going back also to the reorganization, how things used to work under&#13;
the '52-you referred to the way [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Do you think this was perhaps because--the diplomats would tend to be the&#13;
senior officials ofthe Bank in contrast to the soldiers so as things went up ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: I don't think they were diplomats. I doubt whether they were diplomats visÂ­&#13;
a-vis the countries themselves. They were diplomats vis-a-vis the president of the&#13;
Bank and the Board ofthe Bank and therefore put their own coloration on what&#13;
should be said in light of whether they would be accused of this, that or the other.&#13;
That's a mean interpretation, but I think it's probably a more correct one.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: 1 wonder if [inaudible] I mean, say, people sort of my age who are coming&#13;
to the Bank now. On~-and this is very constant, in fact--that the work of rewriting&#13;
papers, they have to revise it again and again and again and again.&#13;
&#13;
KING: That still goes on?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yeah, in fact, my sense--no more than that-is it has in fact very much&#13;
increased ..&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's terrible.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [inaudible1of editing and re-editing and re-re-editing. And then it goes up&#13;
and again gets edited. It sort of struck me as curious when you said that because the&#13;
soldiers then must be the generals now who ...&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
KING: Not necessarily.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Not really, but I think to some extent.&#13;
&#13;
KING: I remember one ludicrous example was when I was in the projects&#13;
department. There was this American engineer who wrote a report. And IÂ· was the&#13;
intermediary, the blue pencil intermediary. And I suggested three or four changes for&#13;
clarity, for the sake of clarity. The report was not in any way, I would say, what I&#13;
would have written, even if I had been saying the same thing, I wouldn't have written&#13;
it that way, I would have said--but I didn't. I thought it was a waste of time. It was&#13;
reasonable, but it wasn't my type of English. So I had these changes made and sent it&#13;
up.&#13;
&#13;
And I went to meeting with the head of the projects department, a man named&#13;
Chadenet, French, he spoke English quite well, but he proceeded, at the meeting&#13;
where we discussed this report, to suggest innumerable editorial changes. And I said,&#13;
"Bernard, I think this is all right the way it is. I didn't change it. I wouldn't have&#13;
written it like that" I said, "It is my mother tongue, you know." [Laughter] And he&#13;
didn't stop it. I mean, this seems to me to be the sort of acme of idiotic behavior. He&#13;
was clearly obsessed. I didn't think his changes were much of an improvement either,&#13;
as I recalL So, I mean, sort of occasionally he shortened a sentence or maybe madeÂ­&#13;
I mean, by and large, the net effect might have been a small improvement. But here&#13;
was the man in charge of all the projects department, himself personally spending&#13;
time--and having other people sit around while he did it-editing this bloody report.&#13;
mean, it's crazy. And 1 don't-they were not mainly matters of substance.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: At the same time, the quality of writing is very important in the Bank, is that&#13;
fair to say?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Or writing itself.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's an institution where ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: I happen to think it's important, period.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, I know, of course. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
KING: You probably remember that.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You speak of, I don't know, Morgan Guaranty Bank or the IBM Corporation&#13;
or the Indian Government, I don't know, the comparison is that in this institution&#13;
[inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KING: I think so, on the whole.   r think it is.   I think it is important, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: In the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KING: It may be more ...&#13;

&#13;
WEBB: It's a rather verbal institution.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, but I-I mean, I remember when J was, you know, directing the DED&#13;
[Development Economics Department] concern, but then I,Â·and of course I think I&#13;
was right ..but I remember having these long arguments with Doug [Douglas H.]&#13;
Keare. I said, "You've said what you have to say and it seems to me to make sense&#13;
hut," I said. "you have used twice as many words to say it as is necessary to say it:'&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I remember his writing. He was really longÂ·winded.&#13;
&#13;
KING: He took it in very good part, and over time I think he improved. But my&#13;
feeling about good writing is that I Iike-I am quite fond of reading histories, but I&#13;
will not read a book that's boring. I like to read books which are wellÂ·written and are&#13;
interesting. And I think that it is important, if you are circulating something, that it's&#13;
something which people will in a sense want to read not which they feel they're&#13;
forced to read. And I just think I now, to what extent this is fair is an interesting&#13;
question. I just-I know what I've said, but it maybe institutionally this is some sort&#13;
of ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In the oral history by Dick Demuth ..&#13;
&#13;
KING: Dick Demuth?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yes. And he makes this fairly interesting comment that the Bank:, before&#13;
Woods, Black's Bank, you really-it was said, was more verbaL and then when&#13;
Woods comes in, the process of policy papers to the Board begins, agriculture,&#13;
education, you know ..&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, Black was par excellence a personÂ·toÂ·person ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. And then he sort of sees [inaudible] in a sense a sort of explosion in&#13;
that sheer volume of paper.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, yes, not all of them, by the way.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Someone gave me this statistic, which I have to check, that last year in the&#13;
Bank, the number ofcopies, the Xeroxes done, was 400 million, more than 2 million&#13;
over the next [inaudible] Now I don't know [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KING: You have to sort of factor into that how many Xerox copies ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Xeroxes aren't printing.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, I think-you mean the grey cover are not included, that's clear.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But then [inaudible] the whole process actually been formalizing&#13;
everything. [inaudible1 Demuth was clearly unhappy with what happened.&#13;
&#13;
KING: I don't question the facts; 1 question the interpretation. I think the larger an&#13;
organization gets, the interÂ·communication by paper must increase exponentially.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
And whether it is a square ofthc number of people or a cube or a fourth part, who&#13;
knows. But the notion was to have-if you only have to tell one person, you don't&#13;
have to write it, perhaps. If you have to tell four people, you must write it. Now,&#13;
nowadays I would have thought that they have these-you do it by computer, the AllÂ­&#13;
In-One system. But of course, that takes paper, also. It takes a different kind of&#13;
paper; it takes computer paper.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: ~o, that's also laser jet printing, so now you have both, you have it in hard&#13;
copy and on electronic. All it has done is to increase, rather.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, yeah. The paperless office.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And paper consumption has increased after it, People don't read it, but&#13;
they ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: I don't know how does [inaudible] is. Is it sort of his personal, his oral&#13;
history?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: No, this is a bit like the one you interviewed with Robert Oliver.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, that's an oral history.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: He has not agreed to allow it to be read by others. It's a little bit, I guess,&#13;
critical or rigid ..&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, really?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: .. perhaps, not as far as I can see, but it might be construed.&#13;
&#13;
KING: I worked for Dick Demuth for about a year and a half. He was sort of an&#13;
assistant to the President and I worked for him. [inaudible] I was working writing&#13;
speeches, things like that.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I haven't read that piece.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In the oral histories he emerges as a--not as an empire builder.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Demuth? No, no.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Whereas, ..&#13;
&#13;
KING: He was-he liked-on the other hand he--J don't say that he was necessarily&#13;
innovative himself, he may have been or he may not have been, but he liked&#13;
innovation. He liked--he liked to carry out new problems. He became responsible for&#13;
the so-called general survey mission, technical assistance [inaudible], things like that.&#13;
If it was something new going on, he liked to sort of push it forward. He was not an&#13;
empire builder, no,&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: He didn't really last under McNamara.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
KING: No. And he was a decent man, a decent man. He--I remember there was a&#13;
big investigation about materials found in what is now, years later [inaudible J&#13;
international [inaudible1&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: MIGA [Multilateral Investment Guarantee Corporation), for example.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, but an earlier version which didn't go through. I spent a lot oftime on&#13;
that. And I remember when he sent a report forward. I mean, he paid, he paid me a&#13;
rather undue amount of credit. I mean, he was a decent man. He wasn't one ofthese&#13;
people who sort of walks on the back of his staff. I disagreed with him about all sorts&#13;
ofthings, but I never-it never had any effect, I mean any personal effect, except&#13;
occasionally now, you know. at 1818 H Street. Now I would, I would-if he said&#13;
something which was an impression or a fact, I would give it a certain amount of&#13;
credit.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: You think he's got credibility.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, I think it's worth thinking about. His views on how things should be&#13;
done, his views on policy, are his views, and I would often disagree with him.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: He was one of the biggest influences on the Mason and Asher history.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Was he?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KING: No kidding. I didn't know that.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I mean, proportionately, I mean not absolutely. Proportionately [inaudible]&#13;
somehow I can't remember now what conversation we had; maybe from Asher.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In the sense of giving them, arranging a lot of staff input for them.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: He was probably in charge ofthe DA's office [Development Services&#13;
Department J then.&#13;
&#13;
KING: He may have been, yes.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That sounds right.&#13;
&#13;
KING: I don't remember seeing either Mason-I knew Ed Mason quite well for&#13;
various extraneous reasons. I mean, he wrote the report on [inaudible J came to India&#13;
on occasion. rve met Asher. But I don't remember being asked anything by Mason&#13;
and Asher. Maybe theirs was not that kind of a book. It was rather factual. Not sort&#13;
of--it didn't deal in these fuzzy areas that you're dealing in, which are probably the&#13;
more important ones.&#13;
&#13;
KAP1.:R: It was perhaps a more clearer world or other's perception of[inaudibleJ.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: The one where this, this. there was this famous ... 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It was leaked out. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: It was leaked out and it was--I've forgotten what it was, but I remember the 
&#13;
occasion, yes. 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Were you at all involved in that? 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I had no involvement except to read it and laugh. 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Why was that? 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: WelL it was--my reaction was it was rather-it had its funny side. I've 
&#13;
forgotten what it was. What was the leak?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well, this was after the crackdown. I was looking at McNamara's files. on&#13;
an interesting episode in which the Bank was a caught between two of its largest&#13;
borrowers who were also donors and at the same time the friends ofthe largest&#13;
shareholders. It was a crackdown in East Pakistan before it became Bangladesh at the 
&#13;
end of May 0[,71. What was the stance that McNamara took. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: What was he responding to? 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: He was-he called it genocide. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh. 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And that led to [inaudible1     
&#13;
KING: And that was leaked. 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yes. To the New York Times. [inaudible] And then of course got back. 
&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption] 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: .. thai come to terms about Vietnam, I mean, everybody said this was kind of 
&#13;
to exorcise Vietnam. But they're still behaving [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: There's a very, actually, intensity of feeling in the Board around some of 
&#13;
these issues. A very, very sharp [inaudible] 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Which issues? 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: You know, around the Soviet assistance that the Bank did, the fact that for 
&#13;
a non-member, the Bank is willing for-well, in this case, not the Bank, the G-5&#13;
[inaudible] profits ofthe institution which come essentially from us, our largesse&#13;
[inaudible1 if you are so willing to lend to a country which is not, a nonmember, while&#13;
refusing to Jend to a country which is a member, like Vietnam.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, that's because the Bank is to some extent [inaudible] IDA.&#13;
&#13;
K-\PCR: That's a-you know, I was wondering while Richard was talking with you,&#13;
might sort of see that, if IDA was a separate institution, this might stop. It seems to&#13;
be the tail that wags the dog.&#13;
&#13;
KLl'I/G: Yeah, I think so. It was foreseen when it started.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It was.&#13;
&#13;
KING: By quite a number of people, and it was a common topic of conversation that&#13;
this would mean politicization.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Do you have any sense of whether it increased or perhaps continued to&#13;
increase or ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: rt~I'm sure it increased, but whether, to what extent you can attribute the&#13;
increase to IDA, that will require a correlation exercise of the highest order, ififs&#13;
possible at all. There's no doubt that IDA had the potential for increasing it, because&#13;
it introduced a whole range of new issues, one of which obviously was, you know,&#13;
how much should India and Pakistan get--the perennial issue. And how much should&#13;
they get between them, because, r mean, the subcontinent versus the rest, that was&#13;
always an issue. And r think jf it had been a lending institution, people would have&#13;
had to defer much more to the views that the Bank put fOf\vard, whether they were&#13;
right or wrong, as to how much they could lend. On credit loan that's not [inaudible]&#13;
But there's no defense, The Bank can't say that, in some abstract way, that India&#13;
needs X hundred million dollars and Afghanistan needs Y mill ion dollars. I mean, in&#13;
IDA terms, you know, this is a value judgment pure and simple. And it's not only a&#13;
value judgment, but most members of the Board have political reasons for their&#13;
distribution. The French would like to give it all to Chad, and ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I thought the equation went the other way, that because it would require,&#13;
supposedly would require a poverty of populations, which, of course, by that&#13;
criteria-China on the side--the subcontinent would just sort of run away with it&#13;
&#13;
KING: I can relate to that. That's the report that--the IDA report. There is one which&#13;
was written ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In '827 Twenty-five years of IDA?&#13;
&#13;
KLl'I/G: No, there was one--I was asked by Woods to head a committee, a group to&#13;
write an IDA report for McNamara. And it was delivered when he arrived. And that&#13;
was the poverty popUlations, and the criteria was already established then,&#13;
&#13;
KAPI.JR: I see, rather--notjust when the [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KING: That was, that was. It was a very rough-and-ready paper, This was more or&#13;
less much more formalized.&#13;

&#13;
KAPUR: Do you have it? 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I have a copy of the report. [t was not at all what went to the Board, but ... 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: There's another question that kept floating through my mind about-l guess 
&#13;
when we, it takes off on a point we touched on earlier on, on the question of Bank&#13;
[inaudible1experience, study everything else--I was thinking the other day that there&#13;
probably isn't a village anywhere in the world that hasn't been studied more than the&#13;
Bank studies itself, but then ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: How many organizations do study themselves? 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, yeah, but the thing is the Bank is so self-consciously intellectual. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, it's a terrible lack, and keeping statistics about and whatnot. about the 
&#13;
things which go on in the Bank ... 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Now, that made me think of your [inaudible] I have kind ofa difficult view 
&#13;
of the organization, because more and more I think the Bank--in more and more I see 
&#13;
an institution that's about more than the transfer of money. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, yes, very much more. From the beginning, and increasingly so. 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Increasingly. Does the OED work in a sense thatthe--not entirely true, but 
&#13;
very largely it was true-the evaluation of these investments qua investments ... 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I think that was kind of its mandate when it was founded. And it has--I think 
&#13;
it has gone much further than that. I think-I think you somewhat underestimate the 
&#13;
extent to which it's done all sorts of cross-I mean, it's done studies on the Bank's 
&#13;
relations with countries, which is a long, long way from projects. 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Sectors. 
&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
KING: Adjustments. 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Your own study is an example. on Zambia? 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, that had nothing to do with OED. No, the only one I did for OED was 
&#13;
the one on ...

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's what they were supposed to do. I mean, it's very difficult t&lt;r-you&#13;
see, you're responsible to the Board and you have to get the Board to change that&#13;
mandate. And I think if you kind of-it's been kind of skating ever so delicately on&#13;
ever thinner and thinner ice 'away from that. You'd have to ask [YvesJ Rovani or&#13;
somebody like that. That is--or you could talk to Mervyn Weiner, who is the first&#13;
one, who is pretty good, I think. But that was definitely what they had to do. It's a&#13;
terrible proposition to have to do all those things. I mean, you can only incrementally&#13;
afford enough staff to do more. It isn't that they can chuck it out. Legally I think&#13;
they have to do it.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: These reports, that it seems to be increasingly asking more questions.&#13;
don't know if that's right. ! get a sense that it's kind of cautiously taking an initiative&#13;
of its own.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, I think that's right.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: According to a lot of people from the other parts ofthe organization, the&#13;
structural adjustment lending reports were really tom apart by, sort of, you know.&#13;
have people game the author [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KIN G: Yeah, not everything they produce-but I think they make a good effort.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Of course, this, I mean equally you've condemned this thing because you&#13;
sort of read your paper and you realize what a whale ofa huge problem, which it is.&#13;
How do you begin to evaluate a sector? Sort of the main impression I got from the&#13;
economists on the ground is that it is so difficult to know what stance to take when&#13;
you're faced with the problem of major policy reforms. From what judgment, you&#13;
know ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: I'm sure that in the case of Zambia, that this was definitely a case of the&#13;
Bank, people in the Bank, being influenced by the prevailing winds of McNamara that&#13;
Africa and agriculture-there wasn't that much agriculture done in Zambia; almost all&#13;
of it was in funds-and because it was made clear that the Bank was aware of Ken&#13;
Kaunda's policies, you know, Ken Kaunda's policy footing because they drafted&#13;
them, almost from the beginning. And of course some of the folks had a [inaudible]&#13;
before then.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That was lovely, putting that perspective that you applied. It helps&#13;
enormously.&#13;
&#13;
KING: But I think the Bank, when faced with the problems, does have a habit of&#13;
saying, or in a sense not really pretending they're not there-we used to do that-but&#13;
feeling that, that staying, "Look, we really can't-well, we really can't, we don't&#13;
really subscribe to what you're doing, and there'S no way we can help you unless you&#13;
make a radical change." It's sort of-it's partly an unwillingness to admit that we&#13;
can'tdo something, this old American, partly the old American sort of thing that, you&#13;
know, that there's nothing that can't be fixed. And. you see, before McNamara, there&#13;
were countries where the Bank said, "Well, no. We're not operating." Or it happened&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: This--and maybe not therefore--that might have meant not lending at aiL 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: It might, yes. And one in [inaudible] 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Mm-hmm. And the other thing you suggest is that the Bank could he more 
&#13;
flexible, the political means. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: In small ways. 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: In small ways. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah. 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Remember that phrase of [Albert 0.) Hirschman's "reform mongering"? 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, I don't. 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You never saw that? 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No. 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: He has this article on land reform in Colombia. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah. 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Talks about how oligarchs manage this problem. It's rather--in other words, 
&#13;
they did it with a lot of political savoir faire. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah. 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Partial concessions and so on, timing, what you say, what you don't say. 
&#13;
Hirschman would call that "reform mongering." He was at [inaudible] and was really&#13;
achieving the modern [inaudible] refonns. I think now, if you look back, it didn't do&#13;
much.&#13;
&#13;
But in a sense that opens up a whole area, it's difficult for the Bank. If you were&#13;
going to begin to make judgments of that kind, it's very subjective. The chance to ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, I also think that the more of this that is done in public, the worse it is,&#13;
too.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah. Sure.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I mean, this is my argument with the Spanish leadership and, apparently,&#13;
John Lewis. 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: You said that in your oral history, that if you say it in public and so on that 
&#13;
people are [inaudible] This thing which was their roundtable, which you mentioned 
&#13;
[inaudible] and what it meant. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Right.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And another thing that you alluded to right now, the sense that, I mean. 
&#13;
there's nothing that can't be fixed. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah. 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But in other words what you find is this expression in-you know, that 
&#13;
you'vo got to keep the doors open. You have to have a seat at the ... 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Table. 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Table. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: That expression was used quite often. Yeah. 
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: In the '60s? 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, yeah, McNamara. 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In the '60s, but much more .. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, yeah. 
&#13;
&#13;
KAI'UR: .. later on. What sort of ... 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I remember a paper written by Stanley Please, actually, about Zambia. He 
&#13;
must have been working--he was one of the senior people in that Africa Department at&#13;
the time working on Zambia. He talks about--in tenns--I don't know if you remember&#13;
ifhe used the phrase "keeping the seat at the table." It's better to be in so that you&#13;
have some influence on what's going than to be out of view. I don't believe that&#13;
because I think that this so-called influence was often illusory.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I think part ofthe ... 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: You have to, in some sense, not only--not--either convince people to do 
&#13;
something or convince people--perhaps even better--convince people to think about it&#13;
and to convince themselves they have to do something. Otherwise, it doesn't work.&#13;
&#13;
There's a long history of rice subsidies in Sri Lanka. And the Bank went on and on&#13;
and on and on, but the Sri Lankans never took any notice. And then one day they&#13;

&#13;
tigured out a way, their own way, of eliminating rice subsidies, which was [inaudible]&#13;
on tbe country.&#13;
&#13;
It's not easy. And I tbink that sort of--any pressure to do something has its&#13;
counterpart in fact tbat-if clearly you must do sometbing, the chances are you're&#13;
going to do it wrong. If you are not under pressure to do something, you may do it&#13;
right or do nothing, but tbat also may be right.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's part of the power ofthe Fund tbat tbey're more ready to drop off.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Or maybe they used to be.&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, the Fund is a different story. As I think I've said a number oftimes-Â­&#13;
and I'm not tbe only one to have pointed it out--that the Fund comes in invariably at&#13;
pre-crisis in such a way that they are the ones who have to be repaid when the crisis&#13;
occurs. They are--tbey become part of the problem in a crisis because they bave&#13;
always just come in several years before the crisis, so that the issue oftbeir&#13;
repayment, however, is always. .. And I think some of tbe economists bave~Â·I&#13;
haven't read it all, I mean there's no problem--so recently, last [inaudible], I tbink&#13;
E.P.A. Baines [ph] caught that one.                            .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: This seems to be something which should be heard at either, within the&#13;
projects unit, focused on some of the involvement ofthe Bank with certain problems&#13;
that arise. But it is this content that you're praying about--well, it would have been 
&#13;
worse if [inaudible] 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: That was the road in Brazil. 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. Exactly. But it's not just at the level of projects. It's also the level 
&#13;
of country models. 
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: You know, and I'm saying one gets perhaps a little bit ofthat sense in 
&#13;
Zambia, sort oftbe need for constant justification. One needs to, because if you drop&#13;
out now, it'll be even worse. And I don't know if I'm ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: That argument doesn't hold water in Zambia, 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. But when you hear that fairly much across the board in the 
&#13;
institution ...&#13;
&#13;
KING: [inaudible] I'm not [inaudible] 
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And I wonder how you see that? I mean, the almost the inability to say, 
&#13;
"No, we do not have the spare resources at this time at this place to do something."

&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yeah, I think that is right. But it was--this. I think, does date from&#13;
McNamara's arrival.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Is it a sense of cockiness, confidence, over confidence, or is it sort of so&#13;
deeply embedded in that temper or is it something much more mundane and&#13;
bureaucratic?&#13;
&#13;
KING: 'So, I think in-l think it comes from the sort ot; you know, sort of general&#13;
aggrandizement ofthe institution. Ifyou--and particularly in McNamara's case, he&#13;
was somebody who genuinely, I mean, wanted to make a difference and thought the&#13;
Bank--he was President of the Bank and thought that the Bank should make a&#13;
difference in the world. r mean he made a lot of very sort of high-level speeches, you&#13;
know, humanity, very high. He was always a sensitive person who was wonderful&#13;
about his views of humanity but had no conception of human beings. But--and he&#13;
genuinely felt that--I think he genuinely felt that this was an institution who could and&#13;
it should do more and more good and it should have all sorts of resources, push&#13;
money out and so on. And Africa was in terrible shape, and African agriculture was&#13;
in terrible shape, and the Bank should throw on the resources, And it's like saying,&#13;
you know, there's nothing we can do about people who take drugs, which might just&#13;
conceivably also be the right way to do it..&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
KING: 1 don't know. You know, ifthey want to stick the needles in their arms, what&#13;
can you do about it? You take them in, give them methadone treatment and discharge&#13;
them. And they come--they're back again, I mean, sure, it can run on special&#13;
programs. There are some [inaudible] every so often approach a special program run&#13;
by an unusual person or even a more [inaudible J But the ability to say, "Well, the&#13;
resources we have are just not equal to the task. It's too much, We can'l," lfwe can't&#13;
persuade people to look after themselves, there's not much we can do. This is not--as&#13;
you say, it's not up to [inaudible] the Bank [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Do you think it's a lack of humility?&#13;
&#13;
KING: Not--l'd--it's not a lack of humility. I think it's a lack of--it's a fear of failure,&#13;
which is quite a different thing. But we ought to try, Ifwe say no, people will say&#13;
well, you know--the Scandinavians will say to you--the Scandinavians will go into&#13;
anywhere, you see, and the most ...&#13;
