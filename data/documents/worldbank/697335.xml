WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
EDUCATION AND HEALTH REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1      The Agreement on the Gaza Strip and Jericho Area signed in May 1994, and the&#13;
Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities, signed in August 1994 gave full&#13;
responsibility to the Palestinian Authorities (PA) for all public services in Gaza and the Jericho Area,&#13;
and for selected services, including education and health, in the West Bank. Since August 1994,&#13;
programs have been developed by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE) and the&#13;
Ministry of Health (MOH) to deliver priority services in the education and health sectors in Gaza and&#13;
the West Bank and plan for future needs. Both Ministries are demonstrating commitment to the&#13;
development of leadership and technical skills in their respective sectors.&#13;
A. WBG Background&#13;
1.2      The combined area of the West Bank and Gaza (WBG) is approximately 6,000 square&#13;
kilometers. The 1993 estimated combined population was about 2.3 million, of which 65 percent&#13;
resides in the West Bank. More than 50 percent of the combined populations are 15 years old or&#13;
younger. High birth rates, relatively low mortality rates and changing population migration patterns&#13;
are contributing to a rapid rise in population in both areas.&#13;
1.3      Re ional Differences. The West Bank and Gaza differ in demographics, infrastructure and&#13;
economic status. Most of the West Bank is highly urbanized, with a rural population dispersed&#13;
among 422 towns and villages at a population density of 267 persons per square kilometer. The Gaza&#13;
Strip, with its dense population of 2,225 persons per square kilometer, has only 16 towns and&#13;
villages. Registered refugees represent 32 percent of the West Bank population, of which slightly&#13;
more than one-quarter live in refugee camps. In Gaza, 72 percent of the population are registered&#13;
refugees, of which about 55 percent live in camps. GNP per capita is significantly lower in Gaza.&#13;
Gaza was previously administered by Egypt, while the West Bank was unified with Jordan. This&#13;
resulted in differences in service provision, such as the use of different school curricula.&#13;
B. Sectoral Background and Issues&#13;
The Education Sector&#13;
1.4      Background. MEHE has proved motivated and efficient in its initial operations. Although&#13;
it inherited the school system only three days before the schools were scheduled to open for the 1994-&#13;
95 academic year, it opened them on time; rapidly arranged for textbooks publication and distribution;,&#13;
filled top positions with competent individuals; fulfilled complex arrangements for paying their&#13;
salaries; and located suitable office premises. Immediate priorities for the MEHE are to continue&#13;
operations and repair and maintain the system's physical and human capital. MEHE also has to begin&#13;
to redesign the system so that it becomes financially sustainable, supports the development of a&#13;
Palestinian identity among WBG children and youth, and promotes the high standards of knowledge&#13;
and skill required for the economic development of WBG.&#13;
1.5      Size and Structure. Education in WBG is divided into preschool (ages 3-5); primary (ages&#13;
6-11); preparatory (ages 12-14); secondary (ages 15-17); and post-secondary (ages 18 +). Only&#13;
primary and preparatory schooling are compulsory. There are no separate preparatory schools;&#13;
primary schools covering either grades 1-6 or 1-9 and secondary schools cover grades 7-12 or 10-12.&#13;
The secondary level includes academic and vocational education, the latter sometimes being offered in&#13;
separate schools and sometimes incorporated into academic schools. Annex 1 shows the structure of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
the MEHE and the division of management responsibility for the education sector. Annex 2 shows&#13;
school statistics.&#13;
1.6      In 1993 there were reported to be a total of 1,282 primary and secondary schools in WBG,&#13;
accommodating close to 590,000 students in grades 1-12. About 80 percent of these schools (1,044)&#13;
are located in the West Bank, and the rest are in the Gaza Strip. Around 25 percent (321 schools)&#13;
offer secondary education; most of these secondary schools also provide accommodation for basic&#13;
students.&#13;
1.7      Management and Financing. Operating responsibilities for WBG schools fall under (i) the&#13;
PA (73 percent of all schools); (ii) UNRWA (14 percent); and (iii) the private sector (13 percent).&#13;
Current operating responsibilities are based on a combination of pre- and post-autonomy structures.&#13;
The new education authority (MEHE) has two regional divisions; one for Gaza and one for the West&#13;
Bank. Within the regional divisions, there are district offices which essentially ran the schools under&#13;
the Israeli Civil Administration--they admitted students, appointed/transferred teachers, trained&#13;
teachers, built and maintained schools, collected data for management purposes, provided textbooks&#13;
and school furniture, supervised the educational process, supervised and licensed private schools.&#13;
Allocation of responsibility between administrative levels has not yet been fully developed by the&#13;
MEHE. District offices collect student fees ($20.00 for basic education and $27.00 for senior&#13;
secondary students) and apportion them among the schools, MEHE, and the district itself. Additional&#13;
revenues are generated from the proceeds of school canteens, community contributions to school&#13;
building and maintenance, and through municipal taxes. The MOH has made substantial progress in&#13;
initial steps towards cost recovery, including a health insurance scheme and the collection of local&#13;
taxes. Both sectors are actively seeking ways to become financially viable.&#13;
1.8       Education Sector Issues. The sector faces five inunediate issues, with long-term&#13;
implications: (a) rapidly increasing enrollments; (b) inadequate and poorly maintained facilities; (c)&#13;
shortage of teaching materials and inadequately trained teachers; (d) unmet needs of disadvantaged&#13;
groups; and (e) lack of experience in sector policy and management.&#13;
(a)  Enrollments. Given the very young demographic profile of the WBG population, each year&#13;
an estimated 18,000 new student places' need to be created. The existing facilities cannot&#13;
accommodate these large numbers and budgetary constraints severely limit the number of&#13;
new schools that can be constructed. To keep expenditures at a manageable level, the&#13;
Ministry would in the near future need to consider policy changes that would optimize the&#13;
use of its school facilities. At present the majority of schools in Gaza operate on a double&#13;
shift system, whereas most of the West Bank schools operate on single shift basis.&#13;
(b)  Inadeguate Facilities and Maintenance. UNRWA and the Israeli Civil Administration&#13;
rationalized school locations relative to their jurisdictions, but not relative to WBG as a&#13;
single service area. As a result, locations of schools do not always match the residential&#13;
catchment area of school children, causing some students to walk as far as six kilometers&#13;
each way to attend classes. Many schools built in the 1950s-1960s were poorly designed&#13;
and constructed. About 1,400 classrooms (17 percent) of 8,200 classrooms in West Bank&#13;
are using rented houses, resulting in uneconomically small classes, wasting teacher&#13;
resources. Finally, many schools are dilapidated because of lack of preventive&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
(c) Shortage of Teaching Materials and Inadequate Teacher Training. The West Bank is using&#13;
a revised Jordanian curriculum while Gaza is at present using an Egyptian curriculum. It&#13;
1/  This translates roughly into 450 classes and 450 teachers assuming a teacher/student ratio of 1:40.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
has been decided that this arrangement will continue until a unified Palestinian curriculum&#13;
is developed. Teachers will need to be trained in the use of this curriculum. Around 30&#13;
percent of teachers are teaching in fields for which they are not trained. In particular,&#13;
some 37 percent of those teaching science have no formal or major training in this field.&#13;
Results of the 1991 International Assessment of Education Progress (IAEP II) student&#13;
assessment pointed to overall poor pedagogical skills in science and mathematics teaching.&#13;
Schools also lack supplementary reading materials, libraries, science equipment and&#13;
laboratories and basic equipment such as globes, maps and other teaching aids. Annex 3&#13;
describes supplementary reading needs.&#13;
(d) Unmet Needs for Disadvantaged Groups. There are several educationally disadvantaged&#13;
groups with differing needs: (a) high school students who could not sit for their&#13;
baccalaureate exam because of the Intifada; (b) students still in the school system whose&#13;
education was interrupted during the Intifada, facing educational and emotional&#13;
difficulties2; and (c) the developmentally disabled. There are few trained staff and no&#13;
programs designed to meet the needs of these groups.&#13;
(e) Sector Policy and Management. Reliable data on which to base policy decisions are&#13;
lacking, and few staff have experience in education system management. In the long-term,&#13;
the Ministry would need to prepare for merger with the UNRWA system, and address&#13;
related issues, including the variation between MEHE and UNRWA teacher salaries.&#13;
The Health Sector&#13;
1.9      Background. In 1991 while still under the Israeli Civil Administration, health expenditures&#13;
for Gaza and the West Bank represented approximately $US200 million3. Compared to other&#13;
countries in the region, health care expenditures in WBG were relatively high per capita. Life&#13;
expectancy was 65 years; infant mortality rate was estimated at 40-60 per 1,000 births. Health care&#13;
facility and personnel ratios were barely adequate: 1. 1 physicians, 0.9 nurses and midwives, and 1. 1&#13;
beds per 1,000 population. Resources were unevenly distributed and quality varied greatly. Gaza&#13;
and the most remote areas of the West Bank were and continue to be disadvantaged in terms of health&#13;
facilities and personnel.&#13;
1.10     Size and Structure. UNRWA (restricted to registered refugees), NGOs, and the private&#13;
sector also provide health care services. These agencies provide primary care as well as hospital&#13;
care, directly through their own facilities or through contracts. The public sector operates 205&#13;
primary health care facilities, UNRWA operates 41, and NGOs, 192. The West Bank has 15&#13;
hospitals of which 9 are public, 6 are run by NGOs, and I by UNRWA. There are five hospitals in&#13;
Gaza, 4 public and one NGO. A new UNRWA hospital is under construction in Gaza. There is also&#13;
a sizeable private health care sector. There are two public sector psychiatric hospitals, one in the&#13;
West Bank and one in Gaza which provide some community based outpatient services. Mental health&#13;
services are also provided by a range of NGOs.&#13;
2/ An internal UNRWA assessment of Gazan schools for 1989/90 found significant losses of school time&#13;
during the Intifada. The surprisingly poor performance of West Bank eighth graders on the 1993 IAEP,&#13;
even relative to Jordanian children who had the same curriculum, seems at least partly attributable to the&#13;
cumulative effects of lost educational time.&#13;
3/  This represented about 7 percent of Gross National Product, or about 9 percent of Gross Domestic&#13;
Product, a per capita expenditure of about $USI 10.0 per year. This is high for countries of comparable&#13;
income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.11     Management and Financing. Following the assumption of complete responsibility for all&#13;
public sector health services in WBG, MOH has rapidly begun to operationalize essential policies&#13;
outlined in the Palestinian Health Plan. MOH maintains its primary office in Gaza City while the&#13;
Deputy Minister's office is located in Nablus in the West Bank. Annex 4 shows the organizational&#13;
structure of the MOH. The existing PA health insurance scheme is compulsory for PA employees&#13;
and voluntary for others. Employees pay 5% of basic salary up to a maximum of NIS 73.00 per&#13;
month. In 1994, about 45 % of the population in Gaza was insured and it is expected that estimated&#13;
health insurance revenue will cover 41 % of the anticipated public sector health expenditures for Gaza&#13;
in 1995.4 Efforts are being made to extend coverage. Registered refugees have access to UNRWA&#13;
clinics and hospitals and also have access to public sector facilities if living outside refugee camps.&#13;
There is a growing private sector providing a wide range of services including maternity and&#13;
specialist diagnostic services. About US$25.0 million was spent in 1991 on health through private-&#13;
for-profit or private MDs, and clinics. There are two main private insurance companies providing&#13;
health insurance to about 10,000 households.&#13;
1.12     Health Sector Issues. There are five principal issues: (a) inadequate infrastructure; (b)&#13;
variability in quality of and access to services; (c) weak sector management; (d) unmet needs of&#13;
special populations and (e) lack of sector policy development.&#13;
(a)  Inadeguate Infrastructure. The 14 hospitals and 205 primary health care clinics&#13;
administered by the MOH in the WB and Gaza have suffered from two decades of serious&#13;
under investment. Facilities have become increasingly inadequate to serve the rising&#13;
population dependent on them - particularly in Gaza. Physical facilities, which in many&#13;
cases date from the British mandate and, in some, from the years of Turkish&#13;
administrators, have deteriorated from neglect of necessary maintenance. In many - if not&#13;
most - locations: electrical installations are outdated, unreliable and sometimes hazardous&#13;
(providing for poor lighting, inoperable elevators etc); sanitary facilities are substandard;&#13;
and heating is inadequate or non-existent.&#13;
(b)  Variation in Quality and Availability of Health Care Services. The quality of health care,&#13;
measured by staffing, service volume ratios, as well as the condition of facilities varies&#13;
substantially by geographic location and sponsor. In the West Bank, each primary clinic&#13;
serves approximately 3,000 persons, contrasted with the average clinic in Gaza that serves&#13;
11,000; on a comparative basis, an UNRWA clinic might perform two to eleven times the&#13;
volume of visits as a similarly staffed NGO clinic. In addition, there is no standardization&#13;
of services; supervision and management quality vary significantly, and MOH services&#13;
suffer from limited training opportunities for staff. There are shortages of para-&#13;
professionals and nurses.&#13;
(c)  Sector Management. There are few experienced health system administrators and little&#13;
accurate data. Management is made more difficult by the different priorities of the West&#13;
Bank and Gaza. Gaza needs to increase services to meet the needs of an extremely dense&#13;
population, while the West Bank needs to rationalize and improve existing services. The&#13;
geographical separation of MOH in Gaza City and the Deputy Minister's office in Nablus&#13;
(West Bank) complicates matters further as regular contact between the two areas is&#13;
difficult due to obstacles in border crossing and unpredictable telephone services. In&#13;
addition, MOH is eventually to assume the added responsibility of providing health services&#13;
to the refugee population (1.1 million) that is currently served by UNRWA. In&#13;
preparation, steps are being taken to foster compatibility between the two systems.&#13;
4/ Annual Report, 1990-94. Palestinian Health Authority, Ministry of Health. April, 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(d)  Special Populations. A cross-cutting issue for the health sector is the further development&#13;
and provision of community mental health services to identify and treat those of all ages&#13;
who have been adversely affected by the recent upheavals, as well as provide appropriate&#13;
long-term services to the general population.&#13;
(e)  Sector Policy. Investments strategies should be more consistent with health needs and&#13;
expected outcomes. Causes for low sectoral efficiency include: (i) proliferation of very&#13;
small hospitals (70 percent of hospitals have under 100 beds); (ii) provision of highly&#13;
specialized medical procedures in uneconomical units; (iii) insufficient attention to&#13;
preventive activities particularly for women and children. Therefore, not enough attention&#13;
has been given to the balance between individual care and public health programs, and to&#13;
improving the efficiency of hospital care, the most expensive part of the health system.&#13;
The development of effective health investment and financing strategies are priorities for&#13;
the sector.&#13;
C. Development Strategies&#13;
1.13     Ministrv of Education Development Strategv. MEHE strategy has emphasized the&#13;
immediate needs of the school system including: curriculum unification; improvement of school&#13;
infrastructure; provision of special support to disadvantaged groups; provision of improved learning&#13;
materials and textbooks; and improvement of education administration. Longer-term policy&#13;
development is being undertaken through initial sector work and technical assistance provided through&#13;
cooperative efforts by the Bank, UNESCO and other donors.&#13;
1.14     Establishing a financing framework for the system is a high priority. Currently the PA is&#13;
highly dependent on donors for recurrent budget support for 1995, a financing gap of US$228 million&#13;
has been identified and donors will attempt to finance this deficit. As elsewhere, education&#13;
expenditures, particularly wages, consume a large proportion of central budgets. The education&#13;
sector lacks senior administrative staff with experience in sector analysis, policy making, and resource&#13;
allocation. Reliable baseline data for allocation decisions are often not available. MEHE plans to put&#13;
an Education Management Information System (EMIS) in place to collect data and monitor and&#13;
evaluate programs. It also plans to improve its budgeting, planning, financial analysis, and policy&#13;
development capacities.&#13;
1.15      Ministry of Health Development Strategy. The Palestinian Health Plan sets out five&#13;
objectives: (a) improve health sector management; (b) develop primary health care including disease&#13;
prevention, health promotion and health protection, as well improve basic secondary care; (c) improve&#13;
the professional skills of health personnel; (d) emphasize quality of care at all levels; and (e) focus&#13;
attention on the special needs of women, children, the poor, and groups disadvantaged by the political&#13;
disturbances. As part of the strategy to improve the quality of services, MOH plans to support the&#13;
development and use of communication systems, including information collection and transfer, and&#13;
human interaction capabilities, such as tele-conferencing.&#13;
1.16     Health has taken as its policy centerpiece a commitment to accessible, high quality primary&#13;
health care for the Palestinian people, delivered principally through a network of Comprehensive&#13;
Health Centers (CHC)5. The strategic location and service capabilities of these centers would allow&#13;
them to receive referrals from local health centers, clinics and health posts, and make appropriate&#13;
5/   CHCs are a more cost-effective hub for preventive, primary rapid-response services, including normal&#13;
deliveries and emergencies not requiring hospitalization, in contrast to hospital-based outpatient services.&#13;
Rapid response services would be staffed by a physician-led team and would be available 24 hours, seven&#13;
days a week. All other services for children and adults, including preventive, curative, rehabilitative and&#13;
chronic care, would be available, for patient convenience, during day-time as well as evening hours.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
referrals to hospital-based specialists. The CHCs function as regional centers for staff development&#13;
and for public health monitoring and program implementation.&#13;
1.17     CHCs can potentially reduce total system expenditures directly, by delivering medical care&#13;
with substantially lower unit costs (currently US$4-6 per visit). In contrast, the average expenditure&#13;
per patient day for all hospital patients in 1992, was US$94. 17. If well implemented, the MOH&#13;
design would successfully constrain capital investments for the expansion of acute hospital beds. It is&#13;
envisaged that upgraded CHCs would lessen the need for uneconomical hospital investments. Future&#13;
hospital capital investments and development of services would be based on cost effectiveness criteria.&#13;
1.18     Bank Group Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement. Present Bank policy for the&#13;
WBG has four main themes which were identified in close collaboration with the Palestinian&#13;
counterpart team in December, 1993 and form the foundation of the "Emergency Assistance Program&#13;
for the Occupied Territories": (a) restoring and further developing basic and social infrastructures; (b)&#13;
building policy-making and institutional capabilities; (c) supporting the emergence of the private&#13;
sector; and (d) sustaining the financial viability of the PA. The Bank has been in the forefront of&#13;
institutional efforts to help the PA define a feasible rehabilitation and development strategy. It has&#13;
played a prominent role in setting a policy and investment framework with the six-volume study&#13;
"Developing the Occupied Territories: An Investment in Peace;" the establishment of the Trust Fund&#13;
for Gaza (TFG) in 1993; and its administrator role in the operation of the Technical Assistance Trust&#13;
Fund and the Holst Fund (the latter for recurrent cost financing). As the Secretariat for the Ad Hoc&#13;
Liaison Committee, the Bank supplies regular information and analysis on aid flows and requirements&#13;
to all parties. To participate in the financing of the reconstruction effort, the Bank has set up the&#13;
TFG (US$50 million) from its own surplus of which US$30.0 million was allocated to the Emergency&#13;
Rehabilitation Project (ERP) and the balance of US$20.0 million is being allocated to this project.&#13;
1.19     The Bank has been providing the technical underpinning and framework for the effective&#13;
use of emergency relief funds since September 1993. The proposed project supports the objectives of&#13;
the Bank's strategy (para. 1.18). The project would also build on the ERP which focused on&#13;
rehabilitation and improvement of existing school plant and equipment, provision of textbooks, and&#13;
some capacity building. The available level of financing ($20.5 million), was inadequate to address&#13;
urgent education sector needs. Furthermore, ERP did not address the needs of the health sector.&#13;
Bank involvement in the appraisal of the WBG Education and Health Rehabilitation Program, and in&#13;
the financing of this project would be expected to mobilize donor financing for the unfunded portions&#13;
of the Program described below.&#13;
II. PROGRAM AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
A. Program Objectives&#13;
2.1      The short-term objective of the proposed program is to ensure that essential health and&#13;
education services run without interruption. The longer-term objective is to assist both MEHE and&#13;
MOH develop sustainable sector strategies and establish themselves as effective institutions. To reach&#13;
these objectives, support is needed in three areas: (a) rehabilitation and essential expansion of selected&#13;
education and health facilities; (b) improvement in service provision; and (c) capacity building and&#13;
institutional development of the education and health ministries. Program investments and activities&#13;
have been estimated for a 3-year period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

selected hospitals in the West Bank.&#13;
2.6      Improve Quality of Service (US$3.7 million): (a) initiate a quality service improvement&#13;
program in primary and secondary services; (b) implement a health education program for schools;&#13;
(c) support training for community-based mental health and further rationalization of mental health&#13;
services; (d) provide training for primary and health care staff in management and modern technical&#13;
skills; and (e) conduct a feasibility study on how to improve communication links between Gaza and&#13;
the West Bank to maximize medical expertise and enhance the referral system.&#13;
2.7      Develop Institutional Capacity (US$1.8 million): (a) provide technical assistance and staff&#13;
training for the Project Coordination Unit (PCU); (b) conduct special studies to address financial&#13;
sustainability, managed care, and cost containment; and (c) provide technical assistance to develop a&#13;
five-year plan for the health sector.&#13;
C. The Project&#13;
2.8      The Bank has appraised the Program at an estimated total cost of $126.8 million (or&#13;
US$151.0 including the value of land donated by communities in the West Bank (US$3.6 million),&#13;
and provided by the PA in Gaza (US$12.0 million for seven new schools under the TFG and US$8.6&#13;
6/  This and subsequent statements of outlays represent total cost estimates including contingencies.&#13;
7/  For the second and third years of the project. Textbook supply in the first year is being financed under&#13;
the ERP.&#13;
8/  Equipment for Gaza hospitals is being provided by the Japanese government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
million for six new schools expected to be financed by donors). However, the financial requirements&#13;
of the Program exceed the currently available financing ($20.0 million from TFG). Therefore, the&#13;
PA and the Bank have agreed to proceed with a core project (the Project) funded by the TFG, within&#13;
the framework of the larger Program. The Project would cover those priority activities of the&#13;
Program for which financing is available under the TFG. This means that the Project would be&#13;
limited to activities located in Gaza. As additional financing is obtained prior to or during project&#13;
implementation, additional components would be undertaken. Annex 5 provide a brief description of&#13;
selected health components. Annex 8 shows all program components (funded by the TFG and&#13;
unfunded). This is intended to assist donors identify areas of the Program they wish to support.&#13;
Selection of additional components would be based on cofinanciers' preferences and agreement of the&#13;
PA. Extensive efforts have been made to contact potential co-financiers and a number have expressed&#13;
interest. Discussions are under way with the Arab Fund, ODA, EU, Italy, and Japan for an amount&#13;
of about US$45.0 million.&#13;
D. Project Components and Description&#13;
2.9      The Project would concentrate on upgrading the neglected physical infrastructure in both&#13;
sectors, and addressing quality of service and institutional development issues in health9. Institutional&#13;
development and some quality aspects in the education sector would be funded by donors'". The&#13;
Project would consist of the following components:&#13;
The Education Sector (US$12.0 million)&#13;
Upgrade Physical Infrastructure (US$12.0 million equivalent):&#13;
(a)  rehabilitate facilities, replace dangerous structures and substandard or undersized&#13;
classrooms at 24 basic education schools, and replace or repair broken furniture; and&#13;
(b) construct and furnish seven new basic education schools in under-served areas.&#13;
The Health Sector (US$8.0 million)&#13;
Upgrade Physical Infrastructure (US$4.5 million):&#13;
(a) upgrade, expand, and furnish two CHCs;&#13;
(b) replace, and furnish four CHCs; and&#13;
(c) replace, and furnish four HCs.&#13;
Improve Quality of Service (US$2.0 million):&#13;
(a) initiate a quality service improvement program in primary and secondary services through&#13;
technical assistance and training; and&#13;
(b) support a health education program for schools.&#13;
Develop Institutional Capacitv (US$1.5 million):&#13;
(a) provide technical assistance to develop a five-year plan for the health sector;&#13;
(b) conduct a feasibility study on communication links between Gaza and West Bank health&#13;
facilities to enable exchange of medical expertise and enhance the referral system; and&#13;
(c) provide technical assistance, training and operational support for the health PCU.&#13;
9/  The MOH is located in Gaza and therefore can be covered by the TFG.&#13;
10/ Since the main offices of MEHE are located in the West Bank, it cannot be assisted through the TFG.&#13;
However the Bank is working with UNESCO to coordinate the considerable TA currently being offered&#13;
by donors, and it is envisaged that program TA for institutional and policy development will have an aid&#13;
coordination function.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
E. Experience with Past Lending&#13;
2.10     To date there have been no Bank Group-assisted education and training projects in West&#13;
Bank and Gaza. The ERP includes an education component which addressed some needs&#13;
(rehabilitation of schools and provision of textbooks). Due to political and institutional issues,&#13;
implementation of the WBG donor assistance program has incurred delays. Border closures,&#13;
fluctuations in the numbers of Palestinians working in Israel, as well as the slow pace of capacity&#13;
building in general, has led to difficulties in absorbing donor assistance. PECDAR, as the&#13;
implementing agency of ERP, has gained experience in project management, international competitive&#13;
bidding, and has familiarized itself with IDA procedures. Therefore, it was agreed, that during the&#13;
initial twelve months of implementation of this project, PECDAR would jointly manage with MEHE&#13;
and MOH all contracts exceeding US$250,000 equivalent. Recognizing that successful project&#13;
activities required close and intensive implementation assistance, the IBRD has established a&#13;
representative office which is currently delegated with the authority to manage all on-going IBRD and&#13;
IDA activities. Also, as experience has shown that frequent field supervision is essential for&#13;
successful implementation especially when dealing with new borrowers, resources for intensive&#13;
supervision efforts are being requested from management, in conjunction with close follow-up by the&#13;
representative office.&#13;
mI. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
A. Cost Estimates&#13;
3.1      Project costs are estimated at about US$20.0 million equivalent" with a foreign exchange&#13;
component of about US$6.6 million equivalent (or 33% of total project costs). The estimated total&#13;
cost is net of taxes. Annex 6 summarizes project costs by component and by expenditure category.&#13;
The remaining cost tables are presented in Annex 7.&#13;
3.2      Unit Costs for civil works are based on construction of schools in West Bank and Gaza&#13;
during 1994. The average unit cost for new construction, has been estimated at about US$300 per&#13;
square meter. Estimates for rehabilitation maintenance were based on detailed surveys at each site'2.&#13;
An amount equivalent to about 10% of civil works costs has been provided for furniture for each&#13;
classroom rehabilitated, new, or replaced under the project. Related design costs (where applicable)&#13;
were estimated at about 3% of civil works and for supervision services at about 4% of civil works.&#13;
3.3      Estimated costs of teaching aids, equipment, and vehicles are based on contracts for similar&#13;
purchases made recently by other agencies (UNRWA, UNICEF and IAPSO). The standard package&#13;
of teaching aids to be provided to every primary school has been estimated at US$15,000. Costs for&#13;
internationally-recruited technical specialists were be based on the cost of salaries, allowances, and&#13;
airfares. Many are expected to be recruited from nearby countries. Fellowships abroad for short-&#13;
term study trips were based on a 1-2 month visits to other countries. Textbook production costs have&#13;
been based on current prices of books in use averaging about US$0.98 per textbook and about&#13;
US$0.92 per teacher guide.&#13;
3.4      Incremental Recurrent Cost Implications. As the project is oriented toward rehabilitating&#13;
the present system--rather than significantly expanding it--the recurrent cost burden of project inputs&#13;
should not be a major problem for the PA. Many new schools and clinics are actually replacements&#13;
11/ US$32.0 million equivalent including the value of land provided by the PA in Gaza (US$12.0 million&#13;
equivalent).&#13;
12/ Specifications and estimates have been prepared for each project school.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
of existing unsuitable facilities (some rented) and are not considered as expansion. Improvements to&#13;
education and health facilities are expected to lead to increased internal efficiency and decreased unit&#13;
costs; improvements to the administration of both sectors are expected to have a similar impact.&#13;
3.5     Incremental recurrent costs associated with the construction component should be minimal.&#13;
Most civil works would be the repair or replacement of existing classrooms, which should be cheaper&#13;
to maintain than the existing highly dilapidated classrooms. Many new schools identified would&#13;
replace existing buildings, although some would expand capacity to relieve overcrowding. The&#13;
recurrent cost implications on the human resource side are relatively small. Where classrooms are&#13;
rebuilt or replaced, or where new classrooms are built to relieve triple-shifting, no new teachers&#13;
would be hired, since the stock of teachers is sufficient. New teachers would be hired only where&#13;
entirely new classrooms are to be built, and most of these would be teachers starting at the bottom&#13;
end of the salary scale. The situation would be similar for the health sector except where new (but&#13;
very modest) PHC facilities are being created. Provision of staffing and operating budgets for these&#13;
facilities would be relatively modest and is therefore not expected to be a major burden for MOH.&#13;
B. Financing&#13;
3.6      The financing plan is given in Table 3.1. The Credit of US$20 million represents about&#13;
100 % of the total Project costs. This reflects the inability of the PA to provide counterpart funding&#13;
at this point. However, land representing a value of US$12.0 for the six new schools in Gaza is&#13;
being provided by the PA. Co-financing of US$106.8 million equivalent is expected to be pledged by&#13;
donors. The project has been designed and packaged to permit parallel cofinancing for donors after&#13;
Board approval. It is hoped that this project would assist in raising and coordinating further donor&#13;
financing. Annex 8 shows TFG &amp; Donor cofinancing by component. To permit MEHE and MOH&#13;
to proceed with advanced procurement associated with rehabilitation of schools in Gaza, the health&#13;
education program, and equipment for the PCUs, retroactive financing of up to US$1.65 million&#13;
equivalent would be provided for payments made for expenditures prior to the date of signature of the&#13;
Trust Fund Credit Agreement but after March 1, 1995. The financing plan is detailed in Table 3.1 as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Table 3.1 FINANCING PLAN&#13;

C. Procurement&#13;
3.7      Procurement arrangements for works, goods and services to be financed under the&#13;
proposed credit are shown in the Table in Annex 9 together with detailed description of arrangements.&#13;
It was agreed that all procurement under the project would be coordinated and monitored by the&#13;
MEHE and MOH. However, during the initial 12 months of implementation contracts exceeding&#13;
US$250,000 equivalent, would be jointly managed by PECDAR, MEHE and MOH. Annex 10&#13;
describes the management framework, staffing and functions of the Project Coordinating Units&#13;
131 Representing the value of land (40,000 M2) provided by the PA for seven new schools in Gaza.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
(PCUs) under each Ministry and the share of responsibilities between the two Ministries and&#13;
PECDAR with respect to the various procurement activities. The PCUs would be assisted by&#13;
PECDAR's Project Management and Procurement Consultant, whose contract is fmanced by TATF&#13;
would be amended for this purpose. Because of the need to implement the project as quickly as&#13;
possible, part of the procurement, particularly for rehabilitation contracts below US$50,000, would be&#13;
undertaken through shopping procedures. All equipment, materials, and works to be financed under&#13;
the project by the TFG would be procured in accordance with IDA's Guidelines (January 1995).&#13;
Consultants and training services would be procured according to IDA's Consultant Guidelines&#13;
(August 1981).&#13;
3.8      Procurement review. The following procurement review procedures would apply:&#13;
(a) by September 30, 1995, IDA would complete a prior review of (i) standard bid documents&#13;
for civil works and goods contracts to be awarded under ICB and NCB procedures; (ii)&#13;
letters of invitation for consultant services, to determine their conformity with IDA&#13;
guidelines. These approved documents would be used as master documents for all future&#13;
bidding;&#13;
(b) all works and goods contracts valued at or over US$250,000 would be subject to prior&#13;
review by IDA;&#13;
(c) all consultant contracts above US$100,000 equivalent with firms and US$50,000 equivalent&#13;
with individuals, and all TORs for contracts and studies would be subject to prior review&#13;
by IDA; and&#13;
(d) all other contracts would be subject to ex-post review by visiting IDA missions.&#13;
These review arrangements would result in a prior review ratio of 70% of TFG financed&#13;
procurement. Taking into account the large number of small contracts, the use of master documents,&#13;
and the assistance of the Procurement Consultant, this ratio is acceptable.&#13;
D. Disbursements&#13;
3.9      The implementation period would be three years, but the credit would be disbursed over a&#13;
four-year period. The proceeds would be disbursed at the rate of 100%14 of all expenditures as&#13;
indicated in Annex 11.&#13;
3.10     Required Documentation. Withdrawal applications for all categories with a contract value&#13;
of US$250,000 or more would be supported by full documentation. Disbursements against all&#13;
categories with a contract value below US$250,000 would be made against Statements of Expenditure&#13;
(SOEs), for which supporting documents would be retained by the PCUs in MEHE and MOH for&#13;
review by IDA supervision missions.&#13;
3.11     Special Accounts. Two Special Accounts (SA) (one for education and one for health),&#13;
would be established and maintained to facilitate implementation. These SAs would be established in&#13;
a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. Initial deposits of US$1.0 million and US$0.7 million&#13;
representing a four-month expenditure, would be made for education and health respectively. These&#13;
SAs would be maintained in US Dollars as separate identifiable accounts to be used exclusively for&#13;
project expenditures and all supporting documentation would be retained for ex-post review by IDA&#13;
supervision missions. MEHE and MOH would provide IDA with a monthly statement of the special&#13;
14/ Reflecting PA's inability to bear a share of project costs at this stage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
accounts. Applications for replenishment would be submitted on a monthly basis, or when the&#13;
amounts withdrawn are equal to 30% of the initial deposit, whichever occurs first. The minimum&#13;
size of withdrawal applications from the credit account or for issuance of special commitments would&#13;
be US$0.2 million equivalent.&#13;
3.12     Implementation Schedule. The Project would be implemented over a three-year period&#13;
(Annex 12). Project completion is expected around June 30, 1998 and the Credit Closing Date has&#13;
been established as June 30, 1999, 12 months after completion of civil works so payments withheld&#13;
against defects liability, which are released after 12 months, can be covered. Most technical&#13;
assistance inputs (i.e., for institutional development, textbook production, and various education and&#13;
health management activities) would be provided during the three-year implementation period and&#13;
would be completed in advance of the closing date.&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Project Management Arrangements&#13;
4.1      PECDAR would be the Borrower while the responsibility for the implementation of specific&#13;
sectoral components would rest with the MEHE and the MOH. To expedite project implementation&#13;
during the first twelve months, PECDAR will assist both Ministries in the procurement of major civil&#13;
works and goods contracts. In this respect, for contracts exceeding US$250,000, PECDAR will assist&#13;
both Ministries through joint committees to: (i) review technical aspects; (ii) prepare designs,&#13;
specifications and bidding documents; (iii) invite bids; (iv) evaluate and award contracts; and (v)&#13;
monitor progress and supervise contract execution. After a period of twelve months, PECDAR and&#13;
the two Ministries will review implementation arrangements in consultation with IDA with the aim of&#13;
devolving full responsibility for project implementation to the two Ministries. A matrix of functions&#13;
and responsibilities (Annex 10) has been prepared in consultation with all three agencies.&#13;
4.2      Available resources from the TATF have been used to start building the capacity of the&#13;
Education and Health Ministries. Each Ministry has identified members of their staff to form the&#13;
nucleus of the Project Coordination Units (PCUs). Under the project, technical assistance would be&#13;
provided to relevant MEHE and MOH service units on: (a) planning (sectoral); (b) physical planning;&#13;
(c) monitoring and supervision of ongoing projects; (d) procurement planning and contracting (civil&#13;
works, furniture and equipment); (e) training; and (f) coordination and administration of technical&#13;
assistance activities.&#13;
4.3      Due to political and institutional issues, implementation of the ERP and WBG donor&#13;
assistance program have incurred delays. Border closures, fluctuations in the numbers of Palestinians&#13;
working in Israel, as well as the slow pace of capacity building in general, has led to difficulties in&#13;
absorbing assistance. Lessons from ongoing operations in the WBG were used to ensure that this&#13;
project is sufficiently flexible, particularly with respect to cofinancing. Components under the TFG&#13;
are designed to be self-contained. The project is simple in design, most civil works would use labor-&#13;
intensive construction techniques. Detailed working papers have been prepared for each aspect of the&#13;
project, in order to give the implementing agencies a blueprint for implementation. Papers not&#13;
annexed to this document are available in the project files and an Implementation Volume has been&#13;
prepared for the guidance of the Implementing Agencies. In addition, the Supervision Plan (Annex&#13;
13) programs intensive supervision throughout the three years of implementation and particular&#13;
attention during the first year. The Bank Group is also providing technical assistance in disbursement&#13;
and special account management procedures under the Holst Fund. A Bank disbursement specialist&#13;
conducted a disbursement workshop for non-governmental organizations and municipalities benefiting&#13;
from the Fund, and provided technical assistance to PECDAR on maintaining, controlling and&#13;
monitoring accounts and disbursements. The Ministry of Finance is also being assisted to train&#13;
appropriate staff (through the Agent employed to monitor procurement and disbursement under the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Holst Fund) and the TATF is providing technical assistance for this Ministry on the establishment of&#13;
centralized accounts and internal audit functions"5.&#13;
4.4      PECDAR, MEHE and MOH have agreed during negotiations to maintain adequately&#13;
staffed Project Coordination Units in the MEHE and MOH, with funding, and functions and&#13;
responsibilities satisfactory to the Association. The minimum staffing of the respective PCUs in each&#13;
Ministry was agreed as follows: (a) Project Coordinator's Office--a Project Coordinator and a&#13;
Secretary; (b) Deputy Coordinator's Office--a Deputy Coordinator and an Administrative Officer&#13;
(with an education or health orientation for MEHE and MOH respectively); (c) Procurement Section--&#13;
a Procurement Officer and Assistant; (d) Accounting Section--an Accounting Officer, Computer&#13;
Operator and a Clerk; and (e) Civil Works Section--an Architect, an Engineer, and two Assistants.&#13;
These sections would liaise with PECDAR and IDA and would also have access to their respective&#13;
Special Accounts (SA). Hiring of staff that would be required only for special project implementation&#13;
services or functions would be on fixed-term contract basis and services would be contracted out as&#13;
far as possible to avoid overloading PECDAR and ministerial staff.&#13;
The Education Sector&#13;
4.5      Where appropriate, District level activities would be coordinated by a District Coordinator&#13;
attached to the District Education Offices to: (a) ensure delivery of locally procured equipment to&#13;
districts; (b) supervise construction activities in the district; and (c) monitor progress. Annex 14&#13;
provides some background on planned civil works for the education facilities and MEHE's strategy&#13;
for their implementation.&#13;
4.6      At the school level, each school would have a Coordinator who would be either the&#13;
principal or head teacher, to coordinate activities and to: (a) minimize the impact of construction on&#13;
the learning environment; (b) receive, inspect, and accept shipments of books, materials, and furniture&#13;
on behalf of the school; (c) schedule staff training; (d) interact with district, and local authorities to&#13;
maximize impact of inputs on education activities; and (e) collect school-level data for use by the&#13;
education authorities.&#13;
The Health Sector&#13;
4.7      The MOH has identified the implementation team members and is developing a training&#13;
program to strengthen their project management skills. Health sector civil works components would&#13;
be contracted out to private sector firms and would be managed by experienced engineering staff of&#13;
the MOH. Site engineers at the district level would also assist in supervision. Engineering and&#13;
maintenance staff are available at most hospital and health centers. Annex 15 provides some&#13;
background on the planned civil works for the health facilities and MOH's strategy for their&#13;
implementation.&#13;
B. Accounting, and Auditing&#13;
4.8      The Ministries of Education and Health would withdraw the proceeds of the Credit, and&#13;
would maintain consolidated accounts satisfactory to IDA for their respective components.&#13;
Appropriate accounts for the project would be kept, and all project related expenditures should be&#13;
fully documented and aggregated quarterly. Records for the accounts will be kept by the Ministries&#13;
and duplicate originals may be forwarded to PECDAR upon request. Copies of supporting&#13;
documentation would be consolidated at the PCU offices in West Bank and Gaza to facilitate auditing.&#13;
At the level of the PA, accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to&#13;
15/ Not part of the design of this project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
IDA. During negotiations, assurances were given that: (a) project accounts would be audited on a&#13;
yearly basis by auditors acceptable to IDA; and (b) certified audit reports would be furnished to IDA&#13;
no later than six months after the close of the fiscal year.&#13;
C. Supervision Requirements and Monitoring&#13;
4.9      The project would be supervised intensively by IDA according to an agreed plan&#13;
(Annex 13). Particular attention would be paid to supervision of activities leading to the procurement&#13;
of the major facilities (comprehensive health clinics and new schools) to ensure that procurement&#13;
starts as soon as possible. In addition, since supervision missions would be expected to provide&#13;
substantial technical assistance, mission members would be carefully selected with the requisite skills&#13;
needed to respond to issues relating to project activities under implementation.&#13;
4.10     Annual and Final Reviews. Implementation progress would be monitored on the basis of&#13;
work plans formulated annually, and reports submitted quarterly by the PCUs. During negotiations,&#13;
it was agreed that the PA would: (a) by September of every year, commencing September 1995 would&#13;
prepare and furnish to IDA an annual work program for the following calendar year; (b) by&#13;
December every year, commencing in December 1995 review that program with IDA; and (c)&#13;
thereafter, taking into account the Association's comments, implement the program in a manner&#13;
satisfactory to the Association. The Annual Review would discuss progress of project implementation&#13;
over the preceding twelve months, propose the work plan for the next twelve months, and resolve&#13;
project issues.&#13;
4.11     Staff of the PCUs in MEHE and MOH would coordinate the preparation of the Annual&#13;
Work Program and organize the annual reviews. The Line Ministries would be responsible for all&#13;
evaluation-related activities under the project, including: (a) monitoring key project indicators; (b)&#13;
collecting information on project achievements; (c) consolidating information received from the&#13;
District Offices and from other sources; and (d) summarizing information quarterly for presentation to&#13;
the MEHE and MOH, PECDAR, IDA and donors.&#13;
4.12     The MEHE and MOH would prepare a plan by not later than September 30, 1995, which&#13;
would include proposals for: (a) standardizing data collection according to key monitoring indicators&#13;
(to be designed by MEHE and MOH with assistance from IDA); (b) computerizing project statistics;&#13;
and (c) undertaking statistical analyses. The information and analyses prepared would be reviewed&#13;
with IDA during the Annual Reviews.&#13;
V. SUSTAINABILITY, ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, AND GENDER ISSUES&#13;
5.1      Proiect Sustainabilitv. The project aims to support and maintain existing services, while&#13;
assisting the PA in developing longer-term strategies for economic sustainability. Technical assistance&#13;
would help both MEHE and MOH review and rationalize their finances in the immediate future.&#13;
Education in the WBG is not free. Fees of US$20.00 and US$27.00 are paid by students in Grades&#13;
1-10 and 11-12 respectively. Although there are some exemptions, revenue from fees is estimated at&#13;
about US$8.0 million. The immediate recurrent costs generated by project-financed inputs would be&#13;
modest. In the case of education, new classrooms and schools built (40-student capacity) would help&#13;
reduce teacher requirements. Many existing schools currently operating in rented facilities (old&#13;
houses) where the classrooms are small, are wasting teacher resources. Palestinian society places&#13;
very high value on education and the communities have over the years, particularly during the&#13;
intifada, built and maintained many schools. Funds are frequently raised by the communities to&#13;
upgrade schools. These initiatives would be maximized by the PA through a "matching fund"&#13;
program that would build schools in communities that provide contributions (in cash, in kind and&#13;
land) ranging from 20% to 80% of the investment. Communities have already donated land for the&#13;
construction of new schools representing a value of about US$3.6 million in West Bank. In the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
health sector, rationalization and concentration of services at the primary level would reduce&#13;
investments and future higher running costs associated with hospitals. Moreover, the rehabilitated&#13;
and new facilities would be of a more permanent nature and would require less mainteprance.&#13;
Rationalization of facilities and personnel is a major concern for both sectors and technical assistance&#13;
to help focus on related issues and cost containment would be provided under the project.&#13;
5.2      Environmental Impact. The impact of the proposed project on the environment would be&#13;
limited and should be positive. The project has been given an environmental rating of "B".&#13;
Construction debris generated, as well as medical and solid wastes from upgraded clinics and&#13;
hospitals, would be properly disposed, and waste management procedures would be introduced to&#13;
mitigate any negative environmental impact of the proposed project. Controlled landfills are being&#13;
developed in Gaza with funding from the European Union and Germany.&#13;
5.3        An environmental analysis, carried out at pre-appraisal, recommended a comprehensive&#13;
medical waste management study (Annex 16). This study is being financed through the Technical&#13;
Assistance Trust Fund (TATF) and contains a survey of medical wastes, recommendations for&#13;
awareness and training programs, and management alternatives, including private sector participation&#13;
in medical waste management. Schools and medical facilities under the project would receive training&#13;
in facility maintenance which is expected to have a positive impact on both the environmental and&#13;
public health areas. Health education would directly address environmental issues.&#13;
5.4      Resettlement. No resettlement activities are anticipated, as construction would be carried&#13;
out at existing sites. New schools would be constructed at vacant sites owned by the PA or donated&#13;
to the PA by local communities.&#13;
5.5      Gender Issues. The education component of the project would benefit girls in that: (a) it&#13;
would provide appropriate and adequate sanitary facilities at school sites (frequently noted as&#13;
beneficial to keeping girls in school); (b) develop teaching materials free of gender bias; and (c)&#13;
increase appropriate access to schools through the targeting of girls' and co-educational schools. The&#13;
health component would ensure equitable allocation of resources to addressing the needs of women&#13;
and girls including; (a) strengthening maternal/child health care as part of primary health care&#13;
services; (b) training and recruitment of women in professional positions; and (c) health education&#13;
targeted to the needs of women and girls. Gender disaggregated data would be collected during&#13;
project monitoring.&#13;
VI. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
6.1       Benefits. Overall, the project is expected to improve the efficiency and equity of&#13;
educational and health services for a population of about one million people in Gaza. Specific&#13;
potential project benefits are: (a) improved education facilities to reduce overcrowding and its adverse&#13;
effects on teaching and learning; (b) improved health services through more appropriate facilities and&#13;
trained health personnel; (c) more efficient mental health services; (d) improved sectoral capacity to&#13;
administer and develop education and health programs essential for sustainable development in WBG;&#13;
(e) increased employment in the construction industry through the construction activities generated by&#13;
the project; and (f) increased economic activity in the local architectural and engineering firms who&#13;
would be contracted to provide design and supervision services. The project is also expected to&#13;
increase the efficiency of health and education expenditures through more rational resource allocations&#13;
and better cost recovery mechanisms. In addition, the project would serve as a catalyst to attract&#13;
cofinancing for implementation of the comprehensive Program. Finally, project activities would&#13;
contribute to stabilizing the social environment and creating a positive atmosphere for future growth&#13;
in the region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
6.2      Risks. All projects in WBG face political risk. Project specific risks are also anticipated&#13;
due to: (a) the physical separation between the West Bank and Gaza and border closures; (b) the&#13;
significant variations in capacity and needs between the West Bank and Gaza, which are being&#13;
addressed through flexibility in project design, and the developrment of unified policies; (c)&#13;
institutional weaknesses in MEHE and MOH, which are being addressed through technical assistance&#13;
from multiple donors and international agencies as well as under this project; (d) possible lack of&#13;
coordination between PECDAR (the Borrower) and the Ministries (the implementing agencies),&#13;
which would be minimized by clarifying their respective roles and responsibilities. PECDAR, which&#13;
has gained considerable experience and expertise through ERP, would take the lead during the first 12&#13;
months of implementation to assist the MEHE and MOH build their project management capabilities&#13;
and familiarize themselves with Bank procedures.&#13;
VIl. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1      During negotiations. agreement of PECDAR was reached on:&#13;
(a) distribution of responsibility among PECDAR, and the MEHE and MOH with respect to&#13;
functions relating to procurement, withdrawals, accounting and reporting requirements, and&#13;
operation of the special accounts (paras. 4.1 and 6.2);&#13;
(b) the creation of core Coordinating Units, one in MEHE and one in MOH, and the&#13;
recruitment and appointment of key staff (para. 4.4);&#13;
(c) submission to IDA of annual work programs for project activities, joint IDA/Borrower&#13;
review of such programs and plans, and their implementation in a manner satisfactory to&#13;
IDA (para. 4.10); and&#13;
7.2      During negotiations, understanding with PECDAR was reached on:&#13;
(a)  implementation plans for the first year of the project as follows: (i) MEHE would&#13;
undertake rehabilitation work in basic education schools, and the construction of seven new&#13;
schools in Gaza; and (ii) MOH would undertake the replacement of four comprehensive&#13;
health centers. In both sectors, training for PCU staff will be initiated, and studies&#13;
contracted.&#13;
(b) project impact indicators to be developed in tandem with new monitoring and evaluation&#13;
systems for the respective sectors, by September 30, 1995. The delegations confirmed&#13;
their joint understanding that the progress indicators referred to under Section B (i) of&#13;
Schedule 4 of the Trust Fund Credit Agreement are those contained in the Annex to the&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report entitled "Implementation Schedule of Key Activities".&#13;
7.3      Subject to the above agreements and conditions, the proposed project would constitute a&#13;
suitable basis for a Trust Fund Credit of US$20.0 million out of the Trust Fund for Gaza to the&#13;
Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR).&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
EDUCATION AND HEALTH REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Supplementary Readers and Libraries for Basic Education&#13;
1.    Objectives. The component aims to: (a) to assist children in learning language&#13;
and (b) to motivate children to develop reading habits and resourcefulness for creative&#13;
work.&#13;
2.    Rationale. School libraries in the West Bank and Gaza have suffered from&#13;
under funding over the past twenty five years. Where school libraries still operate,&#13;
they have antiquated stock. The teachers have had no specialized training in the&#13;
running of school libraries, and no provision has been made in the school timetable&#13;
for library use. Many schools have the vestiges of a library which has usually long&#13;
since ceased to be an integrated part of the education process.&#13;
3.    Components. Project components comprise: (a) a survey of existing library&#13;
and supplementary reading materials to be carried out by teachers in conjunction with&#13;
a local NGO to cover: classification and cataloguing; reference books, SRMs, Science&#13;
and technical books as well as graded reading materials; the physical location and&#13;
condition of books; staff trained in library and supplementary reading materials use;&#13;
record keeping, timetable provision for library use and furniture requirements; and&#13;
appropriateness of stock for age range; (b) teacher training in library management to&#13;
be organized at District level through NGO mechanisms; and (c) book selection from&#13;
a wide number of sources for supplementary reading materials in Arabic from nearby&#13;
countries. The Cairo Book Fair and the Bologna Book Fair (the latter exclusively for&#13;
children's books) could be visited by a suitable library supplier at his own expense in&#13;
order to draw up a list of candidates. A committee appointed by the Minister for&#13;
Education could then approve the titles to be purchased. Bulk buying should allow&#13;
considerable discounts. For this reason the unit cost per book has been estimated at&#13;
the modest sum of US$5.00&#13;
4.    Implementing Agency. The project will be implemented under the auspices of&#13;
the MEHE through educational NGOs or universities.&#13;
5.    Cost Estimates. The expenditure on books and furniture in the first year is in&#13;
the order of US$7.3 million, but the capital costs for the subsequent years would be&#13;
modest at approximately US$300,000 per annum. Training and technical assistance&#13;
costs are minimal at US$150,000 in the first year reducing to US$5,500 in subsequent&#13;
years as training will only be necessary at the rate of one teacher for each new&#13;
school. The total cost of the component should be approximately US$8.2 million and&#13;
should be able to attract a donor to finance it as a single component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
6.    Risks. Risks attached to the component relate to poor training of teachers in&#13;
the use of reading materials, loss of books and lack of use of facilities. These depend&#13;
on creating an atmosphere whereby quality inputs to the system are utilized&#13;
appropriately and enthusiastically.&#13;
7.    Sustainability. Teacher training on the use of supplementary reading materials&#13;
should eventually be integrated into pre-service training. Training in school&#13;
librarianship should also become a specialty in the appropriate faculty. Such training&#13;
would ensure that materials were used and cared for. It is possible that this&#13;
component, along with that for school equipment, could become of interest to&#13;
communities to finance.&#13;

EDUCATION AND HEALTH REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Special Studies: Managed Care. Cost Containment and Financial Sustainability&#13;
1.    Objective. The project aims to support the analysis, identification and adoption of&#13;
short-term measures that contribute to the fiscal solvency of the MOH. Among the most&#13;
critical cost issues faced by the MOH are: (a) the high cost of treatments abroad, including&#13;
services from Israeli hospitals, (b) cost of pharmaceuticals as a proportion of total health&#13;
expenditures, and (b) unexplored revenue generating targets.&#13;
2.    Rationale. As a complement to the Technical Assistance Trust Fund, the EHRP&#13;
special studies are intended to address more immediate solutions to pressing issues of&#13;
sustainability. A select set of high cost budget line items are the focus of these studies. An&#13;
objective review of current operating activities, in light of potential managed care&#13;
application, would guide the rapid adoption of cost containment measure. Application in the&#13;
management, as well as patient service arenas is anticipated.&#13;
3.    Components. This component would consist of two special studies. One would&#13;
address managed care practices and their potential application and adoption. The other&#13;
would address data identification and collection to monitor financial sustainability and&#13;
monitoring triggers for fiscal corrective actions.&#13;
4.    Implementing Agency. In collaboration with the Finance Unit of the MOH, the&#13;
special studies would be conducted by local or foreign consultants with expertise int he&#13;
subject matter.&#13;
5.    Cost Estimates. Each study would cost approximately US$80,000 and would be&#13;
conducted during a 6 month timeframe.&#13;
6.    Risks. The possibility that the TAFT project addresses and solves either of these&#13;
issues during its early work would preclude the necessity of these studies.&#13;
7.    Sustainability. As special studies to be conducted in the specified time frame, this&#13;
component would not generate recurrent costs for the MOH.&#13;

Quality Improvement of Health Services&#13;
1.    Objective. The project aims to improve the efficiency and quality of health services&#13;
provided in all public sector facilities by responding to consumer preferences and demands.&#13;
2.    Rationale. New physical health system infrastructure, specifically in the form of&#13;
district-base Comprehensive Health Centers, is substantially more relevant when created as&#13;
part of a larger program for system reform, including a new emphasis on quality and&#13;
efficiency of resource use. Not only the new facilities, but all public sector facilities, should&#13;
incorporate activities of problem identification, team problem solving and solution&#13;
implementation in order to advance the operational functioning and management of health&#13;
services.&#13;
3.    Components. The quality improvement project would be initiated with hospital and&#13;
PHC teams though a combination of: (a) training workshops aimed at improving the work&#13;
environment of Palestinian health facilities; (b) applied exercises in a variety of field settings&#13;
and documentation of results; (c) methods developed for measuring and evaluating&#13;
comparative improvement exercises; and (d) dissemination of improvement strategies to&#13;
enhance professional communication and stimulate experimentation with corrective measures.&#13;
Two important subjects are targeted initially: services--general level of cleanliness, patient&#13;
reception, admission procedures, visiting habits, patient satisfaction, waiting times, staff&#13;
overwork/underwork, renovation and maintenance problems, overcrowding, poor compliance&#13;
with schedules; and information--medical records, appointment systems, sign posing, defining&#13;
services provided, regulation and procedures, job description/responsibility/authority,&#13;
channels of communication and patient follow-up.&#13;
4.    Implementing Agency. The initial workshops would be conducted as a joint project&#13;
between the Ministry of Health, the Planning and Research Center, the Quality of Health&#13;
Care Unit of the Palestine Council of Health and the Al-Najah University. The Quality of&#13;
Health Care Unit would be responsible for the development of the Quality Improvement&#13;
project throughout the Palestinian health system.&#13;
5.    Cost Estimates. Base cost estimates were based on: (a) thirty man-months of&#13;
international specialist services at US$450,000; (b) sixty man-months of local specialist&#13;
services at US$120,000; (c) training costs at US$500,000; (d) materials and supplies at&#13;
US$179,000; and (e) equipment at US$37,000.&#13;

Comrnunication Links for Health System Development&#13;
1.    Objective. The project focus is the development of staff and management structures&#13;
by improving information transfer, easing communication within and between the medical&#13;
communities of Gaza and the West Bank, and using communication technology to provide&#13;
more widespread access to training for all levels and types of PHC and hospital staff with&#13;
maximum flexibility for use throughout operating hours.&#13;
2.    Rationale. Information transfer, and thus communication between Gaza and the West&#13;
Bank, is conducted infrequently, constrained as it is by undeveloped communication&#13;
infrastructure and travel restrictions. Communication technologies are increasingly serving&#13;
as the bridge between distant communities, for example the use of telemedicine for medical&#13;
diagnostic conferencing and referral, and accounting and record keeping. Benefits from the&#13;
use of communication technologies include: cost recovery potential, re-usable in-service&#13;
training and new-staff orientation modules, reduced costs and time of travel for physicians&#13;
and patients, an integrated referral system linking all levels of care, selective cost-effective&#13;
contracting with specialist physicians, standardizing and unifying medical practice patterns&#13;
and a unified records system, for accounting and medical information.&#13;
3.    Components. The project would support a feasibility study to document and cost the&#13;
potential applications and feasibility of establishing multiple communication links within and&#13;
between Gaza and the West Bank. A pilot project to be funded by donors would establish&#13;
demonstration sites to test the cost-effectiveness of communication link centers, between&#13;
Comprehensive Health Centers, select referral hospitals and relevant public sector offices, for&#13;
example the MOH Finance Unit.&#13;
4.    Implementing Agencv. In part, the project would extend activities already underway&#13;
in the MOH's Health Management Information System Unit with initial donor support and&#13;
collaboration.&#13;
5.    Cost Estimates. The initial study, estimated at about US$80,000 and to be conducted&#13;
in a six-month period, would be funded by the TFG. Infrastructure development costs&#13;
(including local communication loop, and building site requirements) are the most complex to&#13;
design and estimate. Preliminary base costs for a pilot project are estimated at US$827,000&#13;
including, equipment, training and operational costs are expected to be funded by a donor.&#13;
6.    Risks. Given the phased nature of the program components, potential risks are&#13;
minimized. However, there are two potential problems envisaged: (a) the MOH's ability to&#13;
assume recurrent costs related with such a system, particularly its servicing requirements;&#13;
and (b) practical limitations of telephone lines and other requirements for communications&#13;
which are not in place at present. The latter would be mitigated by improvements in the&#13;
telecommunications systems, a process that has started already.&#13;
7.    Sustainability. The availability of private sector services, already being piloted, may&#13;
reduce the associated capital and operating costs to the MOH, and the services provided&#13;
would positively impact the efficient operation of public sector health services.&#13;

Annex 9&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
1.       Civil Works totaling about US$13.57 million equivalent would be procured with IDA&#13;
funds under the following procedures:&#13;
(a)  International competitive Bidding (ICB) would be used for contracts exceeding US$3.0&#13;
million. The only contract envisaged under this category is the one for 7 new schools in&#13;
Gaza estimated at about US$6.14 million, if packaged together;&#13;
(b)  National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures would be used for other smaller&#13;
contracts (rehabilitation and extensions to schools and clinics), ranging from US$50,000&#13;
to US$500,000. These contracts are not expected to attract foreign bidders. However, if&#13;
any express interest they would be allowed to compete. A copy of the bid evaluation and&#13;
the contract for these smaller works would be kept by the Project Coordination Units in&#13;
the MEHE and MOH for review and would be retained for random sampling review by&#13;
IDA supervision missions. In procurement involving NCB, the relevant sections&#13;
(Buildings and Projects) in the MEHE and MOH would be responsible for establishing&#13;
bid evaluation and award committees in consultation with PECDAR and thereby&#13;
administering the procurement of civil works contracts. The aggregate amount for NCB&#13;
would be about US$6.71 million; and&#13;
(c)   National Shopping acceptable to IDA would be used for minor works with a contract&#13;
value below US$50,000. These contracts would generally be for minor works at schools&#13;
and clinics ranging from US$5,000-50,000 equivalent. The aggregate amount for&#13;
National Shopping for such works would be about US$0.72 million.&#13;
2.       Furniture. Equipment and Materials/Supplies. Furniture totalling about US$1.32 million&#13;
equivalent, equipment totalling about US$ 0.24 million equivalent, and materials/supplies totalling&#13;
about US$0.32 million equivalent would be procured with IDA funds under the following&#13;
procedures:&#13;
(a)  NCB would be used for all contracts estimated to exceed US$50,000. Furniture for&#13;
schools and health facilities to be procured would be simple and will probably be&#13;
manufactured locally as quality is good and prices well below international rates.&#13;
Although the type of furniture and the overall scale of procurement make it unlikely that&#13;
foreign bidders would be interested in bidding, they would be allowed to compete. In&#13;
procurement involving NCB, the Building and Project Units in MEHE and MOH would&#13;
be responsible for establishing bid evaluation and award committees and overseeing&#13;
procurement; and&#13;
(b)  National Shopping procedures would be used for contracts estimated to cost US$50,000&#13;
or less. Where local shopping procedures are being employed, furniture may be&#13;
purchased by each School Committee. The aggregate amount for local shopping for such&#13;
goods would be about US$1.17 million.&#13;
(c) Direct Contracting (DC) would be allowed for the procurement of intellectual property&#13;
items such as computer software totalling about US$0.05 million.&#13;
3.       Consultant Services totalling about US$3.51 million equivalent would be procured with&#13;
IDA funds. These services would consist mainly of professional fees for design and supervision of&#13;
buildings (architects/engineers) and for the preparation of studies. Their selection and employment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
by MEHE and MOH would be carried out in accordance with the Consultant Guidelines of the Bank.&#13;
All consultant contracts above US$100,000 equivalent with firms and US$50,000 equivalent with&#13;
individuals, and all TORs for contracts and studies would be subject to prior review by IDA.&#13;
4.       Overseas and In-country Training totalling about US$0.75 million would consist of in-&#13;
country workshops and placement of candidates in short-term courses in-country and overseas.&#13;
Placement in specific institutions would be made on the basis of relevance and quality of the&#13;
programs or opportunities offered, costs, and prior experience. In-country training would be&#13;
organized by the respective training sections of MEHE and MOH. Overseas training would be&#13;
arranged by the training sections of MEHE and MOH and would be cleared with IDA.&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
EDUCATION AND HEALTH REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Physical Facilities - Education Component&#13;
1.         Of the approximately 1,031 schools in the WBG administered by the MEHE (888&#13;
in the 8 districts of the WB and 143 in Gaza), 669 (65%) have been identified for upgrading and&#13;
are represented in the request for financing their rehabilitation, and expansion of educational&#13;
facilities (628 on the WB and 41 in Gaza). Of these, some 72% are basic schools 18% are&#13;
secondary schools and 10% are combined basic and secondary schools.&#13;
2.          None of the schools for which financial assistance is sought are among the&#13;
substantial number of MEHE administered schools being housed in rented premises with all the&#13;
disadvantages of such acconmmodation constructed for other than educational purposes (e.g.&#13;
rooms often too small for 40 student classes). Most of the "owned" schools for which&#13;
rehabilitation or expansion is required have been planned and constructed for use as schools, but&#13;
such planning has been undertaken over many years, under different circumstances, different&#13;
administrative authorities and even by local communities on a "self help" basis, and are far from&#13;
uniform.&#13;
3.          Physical facilities for many of these schools have deteriorated as a result of years&#13;
of neglect and inadequate funding for routine maintenance. By the time they were inherited by&#13;
the MEHE in mid 1994, they were generally in poor, and in places dangerous, condition. The&#13;
paucity of financial support over the last two decades has also prevented necessary expansion of&#13;
the facilities and led to current overcrowding at many schools (which would only become worse&#13;
with continuing enrollment increases), and to inadequate provisions of sanitary facilities and&#13;
specialized teaching premises.&#13;
4.          Since the establishment of the MEHE, the Director General of Buildings and&#13;
Projects (DGBP) has been developing appropriate space norms and building standards for the&#13;
necessary expansions and replacements of existing facilities.&#13;
5.          The Ministry's program for maintaining, upgrading and developing its education&#13;
facilities, in the order of its perceived priority of needs is:&#13;
(a)  increasing the capacity of physical facilities to accommodate projected enrollment&#13;
increases either (i) by expansion of existing facilities or, where existing sites and&#13;
structures do not permit, adequate horizontal or vertical expansion, (ii) by&#13;
construction of new schools;&#13;
(b)  replacing existing facilities where they are either (i) dangerous or (ii) too&#13;
dilapidated for rehabilitation to be economically feasible;&#13;
(c)  alleviating current overcrowding by extension of existing facilities or by vertical or&#13;
horizontal completion of partially constructed community financed schools;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
(d)   extending existing facilities to incorporate such specialized premises as&#13;
laboratories, where required to meet curricular needs, and such essential ancillary&#13;
facilities as toilet blocks, where not available; and&#13;
(e)   preserving existing facilities by rectifying the legacy of neglected maintenance&#13;
through rehabilitation and repair of defects.&#13;
However, in the implementation process, some or all of these activities would often be&#13;
accomplished simultaneously under unified contracts, as many schools feature several or all of&#13;
the deficiencies and needs noted.&#13;
6.          Consultant architects, selected from the merged PECDAR/UNRWA/UNDP lists of&#13;
approved firms, would be engaged in accordance with IDA guidelines for the design of new&#13;
buildings at project schools and for the supervision of their construction. The consultants would&#13;
be issued by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) with "architects briefs" incorporating&#13;
schedules of required accommodation, construction areas and cost limitations for works at the&#13;
schools concerned. For schools requiring only minor construction works (e.g. toilet blocks),&#13;
minor non-structural completion of existing structures or comprehensive maintenance, the&#13;
construction documents, (specifications and drawings) would be prepared by the Construction&#13;
Section of the PCU and site engineers would be hired on a temporary basis to supervise&#13;
construction. For schools requiring only comprehensive maintenance work, the construction&#13;
documents would be prepared either by (a) the PCU staff or (b) the site engineer hired for&#13;
construction supervision at the schools concerned.&#13;
7.          Procurement of construction works (as also procurement of equipment, furniture&#13;
and textbook needs) would be carried out in accordance with procedures described under Annex&#13;
13.&#13;
8.          Construction operations would be supervised at several levels. The Construction&#13;
Section of the PCU would provide overall control and supervision of all construction operations.&#13;
The engineer at each District Education Office would assist in supervising construction works at&#13;
schools in his district, by means of periodic visits and the submission of monthly reports to the&#13;
PCU. Where the remote locations of a number of construction sites may deter visits by the&#13;
district engineer, a supervision manager may be hired on a temporary basis for the periodic&#13;
supervision of the group of sites and the provision of interim reports to the district engineer.&#13;
Continuous on-site supervision would be provided at each construction site by a site engineer&#13;
hired on a temporary basis.&#13;

EDUCATION AND HEALTH REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Physical Facilities - Health Component&#13;
1.          The 14 hospitals and 205 primary health care centers administered by the&#13;
MOH in the West bank and Gaza have generally been developed in an apparently piecemeal,&#13;
unsystematic manner, without any discernable indication of any standard approach or&#13;
adherence to any long-range planning objectives: Hospital infrastructure complexes have, in&#13;
the main, evolved over many years: the earliest component buildings dating in some cases&#13;
from the years of Turkish administration; others from the British mandate period and some&#13;
from post second world war years, the 1940s/50s. Premises for the more recently initiated&#13;
primary health care programs are largely ad hoc provisions, many of them makeshift&#13;
conversions of, often rented, buildings constructed for other uses from sometimes as long&#13;
ago as Turkish times.&#13;
2.          These physical facilities have suffered from two decades of serious under&#13;
investment. With only minor extensions for capacity increase having been financed, the&#13;
institutions have become increasingly inadequate to serve the burgeoning populations&#13;
dependant on them. They have also deteriorated as a result of years of neglect through&#13;
inadequate funding for routine maintenance: electrical installations are outdated, unreliable&#13;
and , in some cases, hazardous (lighting being poor, elevators sometimes inoperable, etc),&#13;
sanitary facilities sub-standard and provisions for heating premises inadequate or non-&#13;
existent.&#13;
3.          Construction proposals for upgrading and expanding West Bank hospitals,&#13;
which were partially prepared by Israeli architects during the 1980s, have been handed over&#13;
to the MOH by the Israeli civil authorities. They are to be reviewed by qualified consultants&#13;
and, if necessary, modified during completion as appropriate for changing Palestinian needs&#13;
and limited resources. A technical consultant to the Minister and MOH staff engineers have&#13;
developed a prototype implementation schedule, space norms and building standards for the&#13;
primary health care centers which are the top priority of the Ministry's program.&#13;
4.          The Ministry's program for rehabilitating, upgrading and expanding its health&#13;
facilities, in the order of its perceived priority of needs is:&#13;
(a)   rehabilitating and expanding existing comprehensive, district-based, primary&#13;
health care centers;&#13;
(b)   replacing existing comprehensive, district-based, comprehensive health care&#13;
centers and existing local community primary health care centers (health posts)&#13;
which are too dilapidated for rehabilitation to be economically feasible;&#13;
(c)   rehabilitating and furnishing selected hospitals in Gaza;&#13;

5.          Consultant architects, selected from the merged PECDAR/UNRWA/UNDP&#13;
lists of approved firms, would be engaged in accordance with IDA guidelines for the design&#13;
of all expanded and new facilities at project institutions and for the supervision of their&#13;
construction. The consultants would base their designs on "architects briefs" (incorporating&#13;
schedules of required accommodation, areas and cost limitations) issued by the Construction&#13;
Section of the MOH Project Coordination Unit (PCU).&#13;
6.          Procurement of construction works (as also procurement of equipment and&#13;
furniture needs) would be carried out in accordance with procedures described under Annex&#13;
13.&#13;
7.          Construction operations would be supervised at two levels. The Construction&#13;
Section of the PCU would exercise overall administration and control of all construction&#13;
operations. The consultant architects engaged for the design of all expanded and new&#13;
facilities would supervise their construction on a continuous basis and would submit monthly&#13;
reports to the PCU.&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
EDUCATION AND HEALTH REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Analysis&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The activities to be supported under the proposed project, including rehabilitation and&#13;
construction of schools, primary health care centers and hospitals, have been placed in environmental&#13;
screening category "B" due to their limited scope and the restricted nature of their potential impacts.&#13;
2.    Debris generated from the construction activities, as well as medical and solid wastes from&#13;
rehabilitated clinics and hospitals, would be properly disposed, and waste management procedures&#13;
would be introduced to mitigate any negative environmental impact of the proposed project. Any&#13;
new facilities would require the environmental review by the Bank, Palestinian environmental&#13;
authorities and Palestinian archeological authorities. Mitigation and monitoring measures, outlined in&#13;
Table 1, are proposed during the implementation and operation of the investment activities.&#13;
Existing Situation&#13;
Institutions&#13;
3.    The leading Palestinian institution involved in the preparation of environmental protection&#13;
policies and regulations is the Environmental Planning Directorate of the Ministry of Planning and&#13;
International Cooperation (MOPIC). The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Palestine Council of&#13;
Health are responsible for the environmental health issues, including hospital waste handling&#13;
procedures.&#13;
4.    At the municipal level public health and environment departrnents are involved in the&#13;
environmnent related activities. Delivery of solid waste, as well as sanitation services, are the&#13;
responsibility of municipalities.&#13;
Legal and Regulatory Framework&#13;
5.    Environmental legislation is still under development in the West Bank and Gaza. Currently&#13;
there are no specific environmental standards regulating solid and medical waste disposal. However,&#13;
the MOPIC with the support of the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) is being prepared specific&#13;
guidelines for solid and hazardous waste management, including medical waste.&#13;
6.    With regard to rehabilitation and construction of new educational facilities, under ongoing&#13;
Emergency Rehabilitation Project (ERP), environmental guidelines are being prepared for educational&#13;
support actions.&#13;
Waste Disposal&#13;
7.    In the absence of explicit environmental standards and procedures, the undisinfected medical&#13;
wastes in the West Bank and Gaza are presently collected and co-disposed with household wastes at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 16&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
uncontrolled dumping sites, creating conditions that may lead to the proliferation of diseases and&#13;
groundwater contamination.&#13;
8.    Some of medical wastes are burnt on site, contributing to air and soil pollution. Incompletely&#13;
incinerated wastes could also present health hazards.&#13;
9.    Construction debris are simply dumped on vacant lots and coastline, destroying natural&#13;
landscapes, and living and green areas.&#13;
10.   Wastewater from hospitals are discharged into municipal sewers or directly into the sea with&#13;
no prior treatment. Some of municipalities have wastewater collection sewage systems and the few&#13;
wastewater treatment plants that have been constructed have generally failed to operate as designed.&#13;
Recent Environmental Activities&#13;
11.   Two controlled landfills are being developed in the Gaza Strip with funding from the&#13;
European Union and Germany, and the completion of works is scheduled for the end of 1995. The&#13;
Gaza sanitary landfill will contain special cells for the disposal of medical and hazardous wastes.&#13;
12.   The Spanish Governrment recently donated three medical waste incinerators which will be&#13;
installed soon at Shifta and Al-Nasr hospitals in Gaza, and at Nasser hospital in Khan Younes.&#13;
13.   Several sewerage and drainage works, and wastewater treatment studies are under way in the&#13;
context of the Bank's ERP and other bilateral, and multilateral activities.&#13;
Project Related Environmental Issues and Actions&#13;
Construction Works&#13;
14.   During construction period, several operations could result in locally significant air pollution&#13;
from dust, water pollution from improper disposal of lubricants from heavy equipment, and localized&#13;
flooding during storms due to the transport of poorly controlled sediment from excavation sites into&#13;
drainage system.&#13;
15.   Temporary inconvenience due to construction works would be minimized through planning&#13;
and coordination with local authorities and contractors. In densely populated areas, noisy or&#13;
vibration generating activities would be strictly confided in the day-time.&#13;
Construction sites would be fenced off in order to prevent entry of public, and general&#13;
construction safety measures would be imposed.&#13;
16.   Construction debris would be disposed at selected sites and eventually recycled. Used&#13;
concrete blocks could be crushed and used as gravel substitute in the road and construction projects.&#13;
17.   Environmental monitoring would be carried out by local authorities in order to ensure that&#13;
measures are enforced to minimize construction impacts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 16&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
Medical Waste Collection and Disposal&#13;
18.   Inadequate handling and disposal of medical wastes from rehabilitated health centers and&#13;
hospitals may lead to the transmission of HIV, hepatitis, meningitis and other infectious diseases&#13;
through injuries caused by syringe needles contaminated by human blood. The group most at risk&#13;
are medical care workers, waste management operators and scavengers.&#13;
19.   In order to coordinate ongoing activities related to medical waste, and review and recommend&#13;
the optimal collection and disposal arrangement, a comprehensive medical waste management study&#13;
would be carried out under the Technical Assistance Trust Fund financing. This study would contain&#13;
a survey of medical wastes in the West Bank and Gaza, develop guidelines, awareness and training&#13;
programs, investigate technical alternatives, assess environmental impacts and determine management&#13;
options, including private sector participation in medical waste management.&#13;
20.   Due to an emergency character of the project, the study would, in the first place, develop the&#13;
pragmatic, short-term solutions, and then address the medium and long-term strategic plan for the&#13;
medical waste management.&#13;
Environmental Education and Public Awareness&#13;
21.   The management of medical waste requires diligence and care from a chain people, starting&#13;
with medical car staff, continuing through collection workers, and finishing with disposal operators.&#13;
If any of these are lacking of knowledge and careless in their work, or allow scavengers or children&#13;
access to the waste, the chain is broken and dangers of infection follow.&#13;
22.   The project would provide training courses for all of hospitals and clinics' staff to make them&#13;
aware of hazards from medical waste, especially from infected sharps, and to educate patients and&#13;
visitors in hospital hygiene and cleanliness with reference to waste.&#13;
23.   Training of personnel would not be solely to explain routine procedures, but would also cover&#13;
emergency procedures, such as what action should be taken as a result of a spillage of particular&#13;
types of waste, or an injury involving a needle.&#13;
24.   The segregation of waste would be introduced in all of rehabilitated hospitals and&#13;
clinics, and monitoring procedures would be developed.&#13;
25.   Public awareness campaigns would be held at the community level in the West Bank and&#13;
Gaza. Both children and adults would be aware of the risks posed by medical waste, so that they&#13;
keep away from risks themselves and warn the authorities if they see unacceptable practices.&#13;
26.   Environment sensitization courses would be introduced into school's curriculum and&#13;
textbooks. The environmental guidelines and training programs, prepared for educational support&#13;
actions under ongoing ERP, would be also applied.&#13;

            The Education and Health Rehabilitation
            Project will concentrate on upgrading the neglected physical
            infrastructure in both sectors, and addressing quality of
            service and institutional development issues in health.
            Institutional development and some quality aspects in the
            education sector will be funded by donors. The Project will
            consist of the following two components: (i) the education
            sector; and (ii) the health sector.
