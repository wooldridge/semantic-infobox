This case study contributes to the learning process on scaling up poverty reduction by describing and&#13;
analysing three programmes in rural water and sanitation in Africa.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  The main current challenges are to increase the pace of sanitation, to&#13;
  ensure the poorest people are served and to improve the capacity of local&#13;
  government to manage the work.&#13;

                                               others about them. It relates closely to the exercise of people's&#13;
&#13;
The status of water supply and                 rights and responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
sanitation in rural areas in Africa in the&#13;
early 1980s was very poor. Coverage            The recognition of water as a human right, rather than only a technical&#13;
&#13;
rates were typically 20 to 40 percent          or economic issue, is increasingly enshrined in declarations and&#13;
for water and 10 to 30 percent for             conventions on human rights. Most recently, the U.N. Committee on&#13;
sanitation. Most African societies were        Economic, Cultural and Social Rights stated that `The human right to&#13;
agrarian in character, yet rural services      water entitles everyone to sufficient, affordable, physically accessible,&#13;
of all sorts were underdeveloped.              safe and acceptable water for personal and domestic uses.' 2&#13;
Their political leaders tended to see the&#13;
provision of basic services, such as           Empowerment of the poorest people enables them to make social,&#13;
water and sanitation, as the duty of the       political and economic decisions. This is achieved through listening to the&#13;
government. So they had established            people and respecting their existing knowledge, social structures,&#13;
large, centrally managed water supply          institutions and leadership; paying special attention to the needs of&#13;
programmes. These programmes used              women and of marginalised, indigenous and the poorest people; and&#13;

    Box 7: Coverage Figures and Targets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The relevant Millennium Development and WSSD Goals are to halve the proportion of people who lack water and&#13;
    sanitation from the base year of 1990 to the target year of 2015. All three governments have signed up to these goals,&#13;
    and the South African government has gone further and set its own more ambitious goals to provide water for all by&#13;
    2008 and sanitation for all by 2010.&#13;
&#13;
    It is difficult to confirm what the coverage figures actually were in 1990, because some countries have changed their&#13;
    criteria for measurement while others used different baseline years. Current best estimates, collated from various sources&#13;
    in-country and the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program, are:&#13;

Health and social impact                        sanitation on human development is by                diarrhoeal diseases by as much as&#13;
&#13;
of the programmes                               improving health. For example, studies               25 percent.4 Better sanitation also&#13;

Water-related diseases are the single           provision of safe water and basic                    safety and dignity; these aspects are&#13;
largest cause of human sickness                 sanitation accompanied by hygiene                    particularly important for women.&#13;
and death in the world, and                     promotion can reduce the incidence of&#13;

So the main impact of water and                                                                      Report pillar on social inclusion, rural&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
  These economic factors make a strong case for governments to intervene&#13;
  in water and sanitation, either by regulation or investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
water and sanitation promote access to&#13;
assets and services. They also advance&#13;
social development through their&#13;
community management systems,&#13;
which enable people to work together&#13;
equitably for their own development.&#13;
The water sector contains many&#13;
examples of innovative and successful&#13;
community management.&#13;
&#13;
All these general health and social&#13;
impacts of water and sanitation should&#13;
apply in Ghana, South Africa and&#13;
Lesotho, although only a few specific&#13;
studies have been made there. For&#13;
example, research in Lesotho suggested&#13;
a significant reduction in the incidence of&#13;
sanitation-related diseases in areas&#13;
where water and sanitation projects had&#13;
been implemented. These findings are&#13;
                                              Gender-sensitive community involvement can have a powerful positive impact on health; community&#13;
typical of those from around the world,       health club members celebrate the production of home-made soap in Zimbabwe.&#13;
indicating that health impact derives&#13;
from the combination of improved&#13;
hygiene, sanitation and water supply.        So accountability must then be                       day of their lives. Being ill with a water-&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Water, sanitation and hygiene are
            essential for achieving all the Millennium Development Goals
            (MDGs) and hence for contributing to poverty eradication
            globally. This case study contributes to the learning
            process on scaling up poverty reduction by describing and
            analyzing three programmes in rural water and sanitation in
            Africa: the national rural water sector reform in Ghana, the
            national water and sanitation programme in South Africa and
            the national sanitation programme in Lesotho. These three
            programmes have achieved, or have the potential to achieve,
            development results at a national scale exceeding the
            average rates of progress for Sub-Saharan Africa. The
            lessons from these programmes, and from other national
            programmes in Africa that are not described in detail in
            this case study, are useful for other people around the
            world. None of them is perfect, but they all demonstrate
            good work at a large scale.
