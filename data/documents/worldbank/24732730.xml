COLLABODRATION ARRANGEMENT&#13;
relating to&#13;
Global Intrastructure Facility Partnership Program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
This Collaboration Arrangement is entered into on October 9, 2014 between:&#13;
(1)   CITIBANK, N.A., a National E;anking Association, with offices at 388 Greenwich Street, NE tA 'I rk,&#13;
NY 10013, USA ("Citibank"); and&#13;
(2)   THE WORLD BANK GROUP, comprising the INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION AND DHVELOPMENT ("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPIV EIl&#13;
ASSOCIATION ("IDA"), head juartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433 US\, ie&#13;
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION, ("IFC") headquartered at 2121 Pennsylvan E&#13;
Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20433, USA, and the MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT&#13;
GUARANTEE AGENCY, ("M GA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC : C 33,&#13;
USA (the "World Bank Group")&#13;
(each a "Party" and together, the "Parties").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad international recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Interr Elti: lal&#13;
Organizations (lOs), the G77 and the private sector represented by the B20 that investin I r "he&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed, to :::p nd&#13;
access to basic services and raise living standards for all, and to meet global economic crc vth&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need presents a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on ! i,; ng&#13;
sources of infrastructure finance-particularly in the public sector-a redoubled and coor:fii: ed&#13;
effort is needed to mobilize pr vate sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of robu ;t pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects anc hi is&#13;
understood to be the greatest barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investme r t.&#13;
(D) Governments, development fiiance institutions, donors, and private investors share an int lie  in&#13;
developing the market for priiate infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand i:l: in&#13;
the numbers of structurally scind and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual emer;E ice&#13;
of EMDE infrastructure as a ecognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range of pri ate&#13;
investors that actively particiate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals will te efit&#13;
from collective action betwe n this range of entities-to leverage resources and knowl( clgI to&#13;
find solutions to complex irfrastructure financing challenges that no single institutior c: uld&#13;
achieve alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, the Parties propose the establishment of a Global Infrastructure 1= I: lity&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF"). The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at leverac ir g the&#13;
efforts of the wide range of ir stitutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastructh r:! ,ith&#13;
the participation of private infrastructure investors, coalescing around project prep nala :n,&#13;
structuring, and  risk mitigatic n for individual infrastructure  investments. In this regard, I  :  IF&#13;
aims to complement existing and proposed services and initiatives currently supported t y the&#13;
Parties and other prospective GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prepa E ' ell-&#13;
structured, infrastructure pro.ects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for access rig the&#13;
expertise of the Parties and Dther GIF partners, in combination with guidance from proE  ive&#13;
private sector financiers into Iiroject structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater IE v ige&#13;
of official resources in the faie of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particular fi r I -ge&#13;
and complex projects with the potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;
(F) The Parties are now interes ed in collaborating in developing the Global Infrastructure 1=:a lity&#13;
Partnership Program, together with other partners.&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
Accordingly, the Parties have com( to the following understanding:&#13;
1     Global Infrastructure FacilitI Partnership Program Framework&#13;

they are of an indicative nature and will continue to be developed amongst the Parties and A it&#13;
other potential partners until tie GIF is formally established. The final version of these obje :ii s&#13;
and principles will be agreed upon by the GIF Partners and be reflected in the agreement&#13;
establishing the GIF.&#13;
1.2   The Parties intend to Nork together with any additional participants who may be&#13;
collaborating on the GIF to further enhance their coordination, in particular by developing tl ( IF,&#13;
with a view to formally establi;hing the program by December 2014.&#13;

Annex I&#13;
Prelin inary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the (IF is to promote private sector investment in infrastructure pi : e ts&#13;
in emerging markets and devoloping economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparatilr ,&#13;
provision of appropriate risk mitigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commercial zn&#13;
institutional investor engagerr ent in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex publi,-private partnerships and projects with potential for commer:i&#13;
viability which require project )reparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastrut ii&#13;
financing solutions that no single institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF a ims to create a global platform to provide financial and coord ra )n&#13;
resources in collaboration with the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of thi i le&#13;
range of donor and developm ant finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMDI&#13;
infrastructure, with the input aid ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engagemer t :ld&#13;
stretch from upstream suppor: on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to down stream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and risk&#13;
mitigation/credit enhancemen:.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer term, by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structure I&#13;
infrastructure projects, the GIF can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset clas s attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking long. 1:0r i&#13;
assets in faster growing econrmies, but which until now have been presented only limited&#13;
infrastructure investment opportunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profile:,.&#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to or erate according to the following core principles, to be finalize :1 u on&#13;
agreement among GIF partners:&#13;
(i) Leveraging the private sector-specializing in project financing modalities th - ill&#13;
draw together comparative advantages of public and private sectors;&#13;
(ii) Addressing pub ic goods-focusing on core infrastructure; particularly those&#13;
infrastructure pro ects that are climate friendly or trade enabling;&#13;
(iii) Promoting susti inability and inclusiveness-ensuring projects adhere to b ?t&#13;
practice standard s for social and environmental responsibility; and&#13;
(iv) Collaborating, c &gt;mplementing and partnering for solutions-mobilizing te:: in :al&#13;
and financial resc urces of all partner entities-World Bank Group entities, mul 1:1i ral&#13;
development inst tutions, other public institutions, and private investors-in an&#13;
innovative and flexible way, to complement existing capacities, achieve greate&#13;
leverage and adcress the complex infrastructure financing challenges that are&#13;
beyond the resoL rces of any individual partner.&#13;
3     Institutional Arrangements and Governance&#13;
3.1   The GIF is expected o involve a wide range of stakeholders who are involved in tI1=&#13;
development and implementation of infrastructure projects, both public and private. GIF pa ti, s&#13;
are expected to fall into one cr more of the following categories:&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(i) Funding Partner s-Partners that provide financial contributions to the GIF wil n&#13;
considered Fundi ig Partners.&#13;
(ii) Technical Partners-Partners that can and who will agree to provide specific&#13;
technical advice a nd support to GIF activities including execution of GIF-funde:&#13;
activities and/or provision of GIF-backed credit enhancement or liquidity suppc 1&#13;
instruments.&#13;
(iii) Advisory Partne m-Private investors or entities that represent the voice of&#13;
commercial and/c r institutional investment, whether pension funds, insurance&#13;
companies, soveieign wealth funds, banks or other financial institutions, as wE I&#13;
other multilateral )r bilateral agencies engaged in supporting private sector&#13;
infrastructure pro ects, to be invited into discussions related to project preparal c n.&#13;
optimal approach as to financial structuring, and the design and use of risk&#13;
instruments, with a view to ensure suitability of projects for commercial and/or&#13;
institutional inves ment.&#13;
3.2   A GIF Governing Council is proposed to oversee the GIF's strategic programmin,&#13;
management and use of fund ;, and development of operational policies and procedures; a I1&#13;
hold the GIF Management Urit (see section 4.1) accountable for delivering on the facility's&#13;
objectives and principles, wit[ advice and support from the Advisory Partners. The compoE it cl of&#13;
the Governing Council will be agreed between IBRD and prospective partners, but is propc sa to&#13;
comprise representatives of Funding and Technical Partners.&#13;
3.3   An Advisory Counci comprised of all GIF partners, chaired by the Managing DirE:oc&#13;
and Chief Financial Officer of the World Bank Group, will be periodically convened to facilit v e&#13;
coordination of GIF activities and support GIF operations. This Advisory Council will serve In&#13;
sounding board, providing guidance and support for GIF Management, and in particular wili E&#13;
view to ensuring suitability of )rojects for private sector investment.&#13;
4     Management&#13;
4.1   The GIF will be admir istered by the World Bank Group, through a small, dedicatec ti ,:n&#13;
established for this purpose (tie GIF Management Unit). The GIF Management Unit will fu lcti n&#13;
as a coordinating body as prclects are identified for inclusion in the pipeline, and then mov:&#13;
toward technical support and inancing phases. The GIF Management Unit will not lead inc i id ial&#13;
projects.&#13;
4.2   GIF activity implemertation teams will be led by selected staff of Technical Partnei&#13;
institutions, coordinated by th a GIF Management Unit in consultation with client goverrimei t;,&#13;
according to specific project r equirements and the project origination processes. Composi icr )f&#13;
the implementation teams may vary according to the need of individual projects and gover in nts.&#13;
5     Activities and Projects&#13;
5.1   Project selection criteria and processes could be developed to reflect the follow ir g&#13;
principles:&#13;
(i) Development Impact-projects that support the development goals of the Gil&#13;
partner institution s;&#13;
(ii) Alignment-proj )cts that are aligned with recipient/sponsor country priorities ic&#13;
strategies;&#13;
(iii) Complexity-prc jects that require multiple parties to come together to providE&#13;
structuring, arran 3ing and financial support, and/or projects which require a bl r d &gt;f&#13;
financial instrumE nts; and&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(iv) Catalytic Impact-projects that have significant potential to achieve financial ia. lity,&#13;
leverage public ft nds, and attract private sector and/or institutional investors- s.i 1&#13;
as through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-while still meeting&#13;
government's serice delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrastri cture investments that have global public good characteristic s! ich&#13;
as climate friendly-projects that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provisior f&#13;
infrastructure services; and tr ade enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconnei tv &#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of suppo t provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, with vi w&#13;
to complementing the resources and support already available from partner entities and ot ler&#13;
funding mechanisms. During he GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following ac i-i' is,&#13;
corresponding to major project development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; proj act definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility scr! r  ig;&#13;
and legal, regulatbry, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii) Project preparati(n and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and PF P structuring;&#13;
(iii) Transaction support and financial structuring - preparing and implementing&#13;
transactions, and design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; and&#13;
(iv) Financial arrangii ig and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing financi -iI&#13;
packages from a -ange of sources and partners.&#13;
6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies-i icluding in particular the management of environmental and ;e- i1&#13;
impacts and risks, and transparency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastrt c ti e&#13;
projects in supporting sustain able, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial, eputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supported operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements i:)&#13;
external implementing entities under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an ap Droach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards and c : !r&#13;
standards and policies, and d avelop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for GI&#13;
Technical Partners who are e(pected to function as implementing entities for GIF activities&#13;
