    EMERGENCY RECOVERY AND DISASTERMANAGEMENT PROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This project i s the fourth phase o fthe Organization of Eastern Caribbean States Emergency&#13;
Recoveryand Disaster Management Program. Pursuant to the approval policy established&#13;
for Adaptable ProgramLoans, the project hasbeenapproved by the RegionalVice&#13;
President. This phase was designed to provide access to emergency financing to a&#13;
participatingcountry incase it i s hitby anatural disaster and as such has beenprocessed&#13;
under emergency procedure (OPIBP8:50).&#13;
&#13;
Thisprojectproposes to make US$lO millionavailable to Grenada for use inthe&#13;
reconstruction o fthe island affected by the passage o fHurricane Ivanon September 7,&#13;
2004. These funds are to be offered inthe form o f IBRDloans and IDA credits available&#13;
underthe fourth phase o fthe Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Adaptable&#13;
ProgramLoan (APL) to which Grenada i s a participant. The majority o fthese hnds will&#13;
complement ongoing recovery activities financed throughthe reallocationo f funds from&#13;
ongoing Bank projects inthe education andhealth sectors, which have been definedas&#13;
keypriorities for the govemment.&#13;
&#13;
Damage to Grenada as a result o fHurricane Ivanwas extensive. A comprehensive&#13;
damage assessmentprepared bythe Organization o fEastern Caribbean States (OECS) in&#13;
collaboration with UNEconomic Commissionfor LatinAmerica andthe Caribbean&#13;
(ECLAC) putsthe total damages at US$900 million, more than twice the country's GDP.&#13;
Some 90 percent o f the island's housingstock was damaged with about 40 percent o f the&#13;
island's housingdestroyed. Most o f the electrical infrastructure was destroyed with the&#13;
exception o f its generating capacity. Health and education infrastructure was particularly&#13;
impacted with the secondbiggesthospital andmost schools on the islandrendered&#13;
unusable.&#13;
&#13;
The Government has expressedinterest inreceiving assistancefrom the Bank and the&#13;
Association to support its reconstruction program and, inparticular, health and education&#13;
sectors. A comprehensive programhasbeendesignedalong those lines including the&#13;
reallocation o f funds from ongoingprojects. The project proposed below would provide&#13;
an additional US$lO million available to support the overall recoveryprogramthrough&#13;
the financingofcritical imports (US$2.0 million), the rehabilitationo fschools and&#13;
education infrastructure (US$5.0 million), recovery activities inthe health sector (US$2.5&#13;
million) and the support o fproject management and supervision (US$0.5 million).&#13;

COUNTRY BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
Grenada i s one of the southem most islands o fthe Eastern Caribbean chain and lies north&#13;
o f Trinidad and Tobago. Ithas apopulation o f approximately 100,000 people and&#13;
contains a landarea o f approximately 133 sq. miles includingthe islands o f Caniacou&#13;
andPetit Martinique. The mainisland, Grenada, i s dividedinto 6 parishes with St.&#13;
George's located at the southem end o fthe island and St. Patrick to the north.&#13;
&#13;
Economic Development&#13;
&#13;
With a GDP o fUS$440million, Grenada's economy is basedprimarilyon the service&#13;
sector which accounts for 67 percent o f GDP, and comprises mainly tourism activities.&#13;
However, agriculture still accounts for just under 10percent of GDP and a significant&#13;
portion o f employment. During 1997-2000, Grenada was the best performing economy&#13;
inthe OECS with growthrates averaging 7 percentperyear, albeit basedpartlyon an&#13;
extensive public investment programwhich ledto a deterioration o f fiscal balances.&#13;
Then, during2001, the economy contracted by4 percent owingto the impact on tourism&#13;
from the events o f September 11,2001, and the global economic slowdown. Despite the&#13;
situation, inlate 2002, the authorities successfully floated a US$lOO millionbond on the&#13;
international capital marketsto refinance onmore favorable terms the earlier public&#13;
investments. This raisedthe debt to GDP ratio to around 113 percent o f GDP. In2003,&#13;
the economy experienced a significant rebound with growth of 5.7 percent andwas&#13;
expected to grow bynearly 4 percent in2004, prior to Hurricane Ivan, driven&#13;
predominantly by a strong recovery intourism.&#13;
&#13;
EducationSector&#13;
&#13;
The education sector hasreceived strong political and social support over the last three&#13;
decades. Inthe earlynineties, the Government initiated efforts to reform the education&#13;
system with an emphasis placed on strengthening the institutionalcapacity o fthe&#13;
education systemby improvingquality and expanding access. The Government o f&#13;
Grenada (GOG) has maintained a continuous commitment to education over the past 30&#13;
years that has led to nearlyuniversalcoverage inprimary education. The GOGhas&#13;
agreedto maintain significant and consistent public investmentineducation, as indicated&#13;
bythe levels o feducation expenditureas apercentage o f GDP andplacedemphasis on:&#13;
(i)providing greater access by increasing the numbero f spaces available insecondary&#13;
school, targeting overcrowded schools and areas with low income student populations;&#13;
and (ii) refurbishingexistingfacilities, especially inschools with fewer resources, to&#13;
provide equitable access to secondary education.&#13;
&#13;
Health Sector&#13;
&#13;
The Ministryo fHealth (MOH) o f Grenada i s responsible for policy-making, planning,&#13;
programming and regulation. Within the ministry, there are five key functional areas: (i)&#13;
administration; (ii) care (hospitals); (iii)&#13;
                    acute                       mentalhealth; (iv) community services;&#13;
and (v) environmental health. These areas are functionally divided into divisions, units&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            - 4 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 or departments inorder to administer the development o f programs and manage&#13;
 operations. Health services are provided bybothpublic facilities and a growingprivate&#13;
 sector. Public ambulatory health care services are delivered through a network o f thirty&#13;
 medical stations and six district health centers. These are distributed over seven&#13;
 administrative health districts. Public hospital services (up to secondary hospital care)&#13;
 are provided bythe 240-bed general hospital inSt. George's, Princess Alice Hospital (60&#13;
 beds) inGrenville, and a 40-bed hospital inCarriacou. Other public inpatient services&#13;
 include an 80-bed psychiatric hospital, a 120-bed geriatric hospital, andtwo 16-bed&#13;
 facilities, one for substance abuse patients and another for the treatment o f disabled&#13;
 children.&#13;
&#13;
 GRENADA'S VULNERABILITYTO NATURALDISASTERS&#13;
&#13;
 Grenada's geographical location, inthe southern end o f the hurricane belt, makes it&#13;
 highlyvulnerable to naturaldisasters. The most frequent ones are those relatedto&#13;
 hurricanes and flooding, but Grenada may also be affected by occasional volcanic and&#13;
 earthquake activities. These natural disasters can produce severe impacts to the&#13;
 economy, property, humanhealth andwelfare, and the island's natural resources.&#13;
&#13;
Duringthe last century, Grenada was struck bythree hurricanes and experienced one&#13;
major flood. The country is subjected annually to storm surges that batter the coastline&#13;
andinNovember, 1999, sufferedmajor damage from storm surge flooding caused by&#13;
Hurricane Lenny.&#13;
&#13;
DISASTERMITIGATIONEFFORTS&#13;
&#13;
Grenada and its neighbors have sought to reduce their vulnerability through a program o f&#13;
disaster prevention and mitigationcoupled with recoverylrelief planning. These activities&#13;
have been conducted through a Bank sponsored APL entitled "Emergency Recovery and&#13;
Disaster Management Program," or ERDMP. Inaddition, Grenada, like other OECS&#13;
countries, has partnered with many international organizations such as the Organization&#13;
o fAmerican States (OAS) and the PanAmerican HealthOrganization (PAHO) to reduce&#13;
its vulnerability to natural disasters.&#13;
&#13;
Inresponse to the lessons learnedfrom hurricanes Luis (Category 4) andMarilyn&#13;
(Category 3) in 1995, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA)&#13;
adopted a regional approach for dealing with natural disasters. Consequently, CDERA is&#13;
prepared to offer a full range o f assistance activities depending on the severity o f the&#13;
disaster and the requests ofthe host country. A level I11(maximum) response is defined&#13;
by CDERA as:&#13;
&#13;
"Disasters which overwhelm the capacity of the affected state@)to respond. I n such&#13;
instances the Regional ResponseMechanism is activated. This includes the activation of&#13;
the Caribbean Disaster Relief Unit (CDRU) which is the operational arm of the Regional&#13;
ResponseMechanism. The CDRUcomprises representatives from the militaryforces&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 5 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
within CARTCOMand its main responsibility is logistical supportfor the receipt and&#13;
dispatch of relief supplies."&#13;
&#13;
This facility was triggered after the passage o fthe Hurricane Ivanon September 7,2004&#13;
and Grenadabenefited from extensive assistance from CDERA and other relief agencies.&#13;
&#13;
Performance on ERDMP&#13;
&#13;
A satisfactory rating onthe implementationo fERDMPis a condition to accessthe&#13;
contingent financing available under Phase 4 o f the program. At the time that Hurricane&#13;
Ivanstruck Grenada, the ERDMPwas beingimplemented at a satisfactory level'. Key&#13;
components included:&#13;
&#13;
    (i)      Strengthening institutional disaster management capacity&#13;
    (ii)     Development o f an early warning system&#13;
    (iii)    Construction and retrofitting o f shelters&#13;
    (iv)     Strengthening o f national emergency response capacity&#13;
    (v)      Construction o fpreventative physical mitigationworks&#13;
    (vi)     Commissioning o f several vulnerability andprotection planning studies&#13;
&#13;
As part o fthe project, Grenadanamed aNational Disaster Coordinator. The coordinator&#13;
is responsible for implementing the elements o f ERDMP and for bringingthe national&#13;
andlocalagencies and groups together to promote disaster mitigation, stimulate&#13;
preparedness, and coordinate relief operations.&#13;
&#13;
Much o f the retrofitting o f shelters and schools had already taken place and the&#13;
strengthened buildings were virtually the only structures left unharmed inthe aftermath&#13;
o fthe hurricane. The retrofitted shelters operated effectively andthe two schools&#13;
retrofitted by the Bank Education Program not only survived without significant damage,&#13;
butwere also being used as shelters at the time the Bank team performedtheir disaster&#13;
assessment.&#13;
&#13;
The national response to the disaster was mixed, partlybecause the disaster overwhelmed&#13;
the national capacity to respond andpartlybecause the new National Emergency Relief&#13;
Organization (NERO) hadnot yet moved inthe newlybuild Emergency Operation&#13;
Center, and hadnot completed the plannedpreparations under ERDMP.Inaddition,&#13;
communication equipment purchasedunder the program had not yet been installed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'Though  serious concerns had been raised by the Bank regarding the institutional capacity ofthe country to&#13;
prepareanddeal with adverse natural events.&#13;

 ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGE FROM HURRICANE IVAN~&#13;
&#13;
 Description o f Hurricane Ivan&#13;
&#13;
 Hurricane Ivanstruck Grenada with full force on September 7,2004 between 14:OO hrs&#13;
 and 19:OO hrs. At that time, the stormwas classified as category 3 onthe Safford-&#13;
 Simpson scale with sustained winds o f 120mphand gusts recorded o f up to 135 mph.&#13;
 The storm moved through Grenada fairly rapidly and did not produce a large volume o f&#13;
 rainfall, therefore causing little damage to roads and bridges on the island.&#13;
&#13;
 Based on the pattern o f downed trees and distribution o f damages, microburst downdrafts&#13;
 appear to have been a major source o f the damages experienced. No evidence was noted&#13;
 byteam members o ftornado touchdown, however, giventhe type o fdamage observed&#13;
 including cars andtrucks blown over, telephone poles snapped, structures completely&#13;
 destroyed, wind bursts o f 135 to 145 mphseem to have affected most o f the southern&#13;
 region. Duringthe course o f the storm, the area o f St. George's appears to have been&#13;
 exposed to the eye-wall section o f the storm for the majority o f the event.&#13;
&#13;
 General Overview o f the Damages&#13;
&#13;
 Hurricane Ivanaffected the entire island o f Grenada. The vast majority o f the severe&#13;
 damage was experienced inthe southernportion o f the islandbelow a line drawn roughly&#13;
 from Grenvilleto just north o f St. George's. Visible damages included the partial or total&#13;
 loss o fbuildingstructures, broken and uprootedtrees, broken utility poles and damaged&#13;
vehicles.&#13;
&#13;
As Ivanwas a relatively dry hurricane, damage from flooding and mudslide was not&#13;
 extensive. Streams did flood andwhere debris piled up to block water flow, inareas such&#13;
 as bridges and culverts, flooding was more pronounced. Roadways were blocked by&#13;
debris and fallen trees, but generally remained intact with little evidence o f landslides or&#13;
washouts. The storm surge associated with Ivanwas apparently not a major factor and&#13;
Bankfinanced sea defenses appear to have resistedthe wave action forces without major&#13;
damage.&#13;
&#13;
The electrical distribution network and communications gridwere the public utilities&#13;
most affected by the storm. Telephone access was damaged but mobile communication&#13;
was back inoperation within a matter o f a few days after the storm. The water&#13;
distribution system was only partially affected, largely due to loss o f electrical power.&#13;
Airport andport facilities suffered damages but were receiving traffic and are presently&#13;
nearly 100percent functional. Boththe port and airport lost lighting systems and are&#13;
currently restricted to daylight operations only. Warehouses inbothfacilities lost roofs&#13;
andcladding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  This sectionhas been summarized from the World Bank `Preliminary Damage Assessment Report' and&#13;
the OECS/ECLAC report `Grenada: Macro-Socio-Economic Assessment of the damages caused by&#13;
Hurricane Ivan,' both o fwhich canbe found inthe project files.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 7 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Watershed loss i s extensive with large numbers o f trees down or damaged. Agricultural&#13;
 resources are severely affected however, for the present, water sources and agricultural&#13;
 lands are inrelatively good condition. Crop damage isnearly 100percent for banana and&#13;
 sugar cane. Nutmeg and other spice production infrastructure is seriously affected.&#13;
Nutmegplantations inSt. Andrew parish were devastated.&#13;
&#13;
Public infrastructure suffered major losses. St. George's Hospital experienced major&#13;
 damage incertain sections but has remained functional. Princess Alice Hospital(the&#13;
island's second biggest) was more than 70 percent destroyed. Only 2 o f the island's 75&#13;
primary and secondary schools survived with minimal damage. Other government&#13;
buildings, including the government complex have suffered significant damage.&#13;
&#13;
As a result o f the hurricane, the capacity o f the Government o f Grenada to manage the&#13;
disaster was quickly overwhelmed. This was due inpart to the extensive damage&#13;
suffered inthe area o f the seat o f government and to the extensive personal losses&#13;
sufferedby the public service workforce. Inregional terms, the disaster was a level I11&#13;
event under CDER4's guidelines prompting the activation o f the CDRU.&#13;
&#13;
Macroeconomic Impact&#13;
&#13;
Preliminary estimates o f the damages from Hurricane Ivanby the OECS Secretariat and&#13;
ECLAC are on the order o fjust over US$900 million, or more than double the Grenadian&#13;
GDP for 2003. Because tourism andagriculture, the two main foreign exchange earning&#13;
sectors were very hard hit-most tourism facilities will not reopen until after the high&#13;
season, and the nutmeg, banana and sugar crops for 2004 were largely destroyed -the&#13;
external current account deficit i s expected to widen from 35 percent o f GDP in2003 to&#13;
just nearly 40 percent ofGDP in2004. After two years o fimprovingfiscal balances with&#13;
primary surpluses, the fiscal situation has become extremely difficult with the increase in&#13;
unanticipated expenditures andmuch o f the tax base destroyed- the fiscal deficit i s&#13;
expected to at least double from the 5 percent in2004. Preliminary estimates suggest&#13;
that the fiscal gap through end 2004 is on the order o f US$40 millionor 9 percent o f&#13;
GDP.&#13;
&#13;
While the extent o f the short term impact on economic growth in2004 and2005 is not&#13;
yet clear - giventhe increasedreconstruction activity which will replace some of the lost&#13;
production inkey sectors - Grenada stands to lose significant momentum interms o f long&#13;
term development, because it must now replace, rather than extend, a significant portion&#13;
o f its capital stock and forego a period o f continuous productivity improvements&#13;
&#13;
Sectoral Impact&#13;
&#13;
According to official estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin&#13;
America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) andthe OECS `Macro-Socio-Economic&#13;
Assessment o fthe Damages Caused by Hurricane Ivan,' the total cost o f the damages&#13;
resulting from Hurricane Ivanis estimated to be roughly US$900 million. This sum&#13;
amounts to slightly more than twice the current value o f GDP o f US$440 million. Direct&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 8 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
damages are responsible for about 89 percent o f this estimate. Indirect damages account&#13;
for the remaining 11percent o fthe damage.&#13;
&#13;
Housingwas hardhitwith approximately 89 percent o f the housing stock registering&#13;
some type o f damage causedbythe hurricane. This i s roughly equivalent to 1.4 times&#13;
GDP.&#13;
&#13;
The agricultural sector suffered damages equivalent to about 10percent o f GDP. The&#13;
direct damagewas o f about the same magnitude o f the indirect damages. Traditional&#13;
crops were virtually wiped out and this source o f incomewill not be easily substituted.&#13;
&#13;
Inthe case oftourism, direct damagesare estimatedat about 41percent ofGDP. This&#13;
reflects not only the damage to tourist accommodations but also to yachts and&#13;
recreational boating facilities.&#13;
&#13;
Damages to the electrical sector were largely focused on the transmission and distribution&#13;
system. Estimates from USAIDteams suggestedthat over 80 percent ofthe transmission&#13;
infrastructure was lost inthe form o f damaged and uprootedpoles and lost and damaged&#13;
wiring. Generation capacity was left largely intact. Damages to buildings, structures and&#13;
collocated telecommunications facilities (wires etc.) are also significant.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, damage to the education sector i s estimated at approximately 20 percent o f GDP.&#13;
The impacts o fHurricane Ivanto the education sector were nothing short o f devastating.&#13;
The resulting secondary impacts associatedwith this loss will transcend the disaster&#13;
recovery phase and cross over to the longer-term social objectives o fthe nation. Ifnot&#13;
properlymanaged, these impacts could have generational consequences.&#13;
&#13;
Detailedinformation can be obtained from both the OECS/ECLAC andBank damage&#13;
assessmentswhich are available inthe project files.&#13;
&#13;
Project Priority Sectors - Specific Damage Assessments&#13;
&#13;
Education Sector&#13;
&#13;
Damage to the education sector was secondonly to the housing sector inits severity.&#13;
Schools inall Parishes and at all levels were affected including 74 pre-primary, 57&#13;
primaryand 19 secondary schools for atotal 150 schools. Some schools also suffered&#13;
damages resulting from their subsequentuse as shelters. Over 40,000 students are&#13;
presentlyout o f school. This includes about 30,481 primary schoolchildren and, at the&#13;
secondary level, 4,032 boys and 5,486 girls who are unable to attend classes.&#13;
&#13;
Typical losses, presentedinTable 1, includepartial or total collapse o froofstructures,&#13;
collapse o fwalls inolder structures and rainwater damage to classrooms, offices and&#13;
other structures. Aside from the structural losses, books, lab equipment, teaching aids,&#13;
and teaching tools have been damaged beyondrepair. In some cases, lootinghas further&#13;
exacerbatedthe losses realized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
 The estimatedloss attributed to this sector is US$72.5 milliondollars. A more correct&#13;
 figure, however, would be approximately US$SOmillion3.This figure would more&#13;
 accurately reflect the damage to the entire network of schools and skills training&#13;
 institutionsinthe country.&#13;
&#13;
 Finally, it i s worthy o fnote that the two surviving schools were the object o f a recent&#13;
 World Bank retrofitting program. These schools, inparticular, the school at Westerhall,&#13;
 survivedwith only minor damages, and are currently servingas temporary housing for&#13;
 those made homeless by the hurricane.&#13;

&#13;
Health Sector&#13;
&#13;
According to the OECWECLAC report, damage to the major public hospitals, health&#13;
centers and other healthcare institutions has been estimated at US$4 million. An&#13;
assessmento fPAHO estimates the damage as US$5.3 million. Both assessments exclude&#13;
damage to some o fthe health centers and medical stations. The destruction and damage&#13;
has severely degraded the level and quality o f services currently available to the&#13;
population.&#13;
&#13;
The medical laboratory o f St. George's Hospital, the central secondary care facility with&#13;
200 beds, sustained severe damage and remains out o f service. The laboratory lost&#13;
approximately 40 percent o f its roof, 25 percent o f windows, andmost o fthe equipment&#13;
&#13;
  Ths information was based on discussions with govemment officials and verified by the independent&#13;
information collected.&#13;

&#13;
                                                -10-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 and chemical testing reagents were destroyed. A complete assessment is pending. As&#13;
 laboratory facility at St. George's Hospital i s the only provider for many key laboratory&#13;
 services, there is an urgentneed to construct and equip a new laboratory as soon as&#13;
 possible.&#13;
&#13;
 Other damage to the St. George's hospital includes the destruction o f the roofs o f several&#13;
 ancillary buildings within the hospital complex. Damages to St. George's Hospital total&#13;
 approximately US$1.6 million.&#13;
&#13;
 The 60 bedPrincess Alice HospitalinSt. Andrew was virtually destroyed. More than 90&#13;
percent o f the roofwas lost and most o f the equipment, fumiture, and supplies were&#13;
 either destroyedby water damage or looted. Within the hospital complex, the roofs o f&#13;
 the nurse hostel and o f a doctors' quarter were completely detached; another doctors'&#13;
residence was completely destroyed. The cost for reconstruction o f the hospital complex&#13;
 are estimated at US$1.3 million.&#13;
&#13;
The remaining two hospitals inGrenada, the psychiatric hospital and Carriacou's&#13;
Princess Royal Hospital, were largely spared. Princess Royal, a 35 bedhospital,&#13;
 sustained damage to its roof and suffered contamination o f its cistern water supply.&#13;
&#13;
Other damages included:&#13;
&#13;
     (i)     the loss o f roofat the Central Medical Stores (CMS) complex and damage to&#13;
             medical supplies;&#13;
     (ii)    the loss o f the roof at the Richmondhome for the elderly and the Carlton Drug&#13;
             Rehabilitation Center; and o f&#13;
     (iii)   the 36 medical stations, eight completely lost their roofs andremain out o f&#13;
             service.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, there was varying damage to the remaining peripheral clinics, ranging from&#13;
partially destroyed roofs, broken doors and windows, and disrupted electricity lines.&#13;
&#13;
Environmental Damage and WatershedIntegrity&#13;
&#13;
Damage to the natural features o f Grenada was widespread. Inthe parish o f St. Andrew,&#13;
the Grand EtangForest Reserve suffered extensive and severe damage. On inspection, an&#13;
estimated 50 percent o f the canopy trees are on the ground. The remaining 50 percent&#13;
have been stripped o f virtually all their leaves and suffered significant bark limb damage.&#13;
The ability o f the forest to maintain its microclimate, particularly on the west or wet side&#13;
o f the central mountains, has been severely impaired. The ecological recovery of the&#13;
westem (wet) slopes o f the GrandEtang will likely occur with difficulty. The dry side&#13;
(east) will likely recover more quickly.&#13;
&#13;
The watershed damage is o f particular concem due to the potential for increased erosion&#13;
andflooding. Damageto the central andsouth-eastem mountains is extensive andwill&#13;
take years to recover. Ground cover will likely retum quickly, but the ability o f the&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
watershed to provide flood and erosion control services i s limited. Watershed damages&#13;
will likelyaffect the water supply, agriculturalandhealthsectors. Additionally, the&#13;
tourism value o fmany o f the natural habitats o fthe regionhasbeengreatly diminishedas&#13;
coastal zone damages appear limited.&#13;

PROJECTOBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
Linkagewith the Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
&#13;
The ERDMP Programdirectly supports the principal goals ofthe previous OECS&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) dated May 4, 1995 (whenthe ERDMP Programwas&#13;
started) and o f the latest CAS discussedon June 28,2001 which seeks to support poverty&#13;
reductionbyhelpingmitigateincome insecurity and vulnerability.&#13;
&#13;
Objectives&#13;
&#13;
Theproject will support the recovery efforts o fthe Government of Grenada throughthe&#13;
financing o f critical imports andrehabilitation activities inkey social sectors. Financing&#13;
i s provided on an emergency basis to avoid the usual time lag between the end o f the&#13;
reliefperiod andreconstruction. Dueto the catastrophic lossesinthe education and&#13;
health sectors, andtheir core importance to Grenadian society, the focus o f this project&#13;
will beto rehabilitate infrastructure inthese areas. Specific objectives include:&#13;
&#13;
     (1)    Supporting the Government's overall reconstruction programthrough the&#13;
            financing o fcritical imports;&#13;
     (2)    Restoringschool infrastructure to an operational level and ensure a prompt&#13;
            returnofchildrento schools;&#13;
     (3)    Supporting the rehabilitationo f the healthcare infrastructure to ensure&#13;
            adequate access to quality health services throughout the island.&#13;
&#13;
Proiect Description&#13;
&#13;
This project will consist o f four components including:&#13;
&#13;
    (I) Financingofcriticalimports;&#13;
    (11)   Assistance to the recovery o fthe education sector;&#13;
    (111)  Assistance to the recovery o fthe health sector;&#13;
    (IV)    Support to Project Management and Supervision.&#13;
&#13;
I. Financingofcriticalimports(US2.0million). Thiscomponentwillfinancethe&#13;
        import o f low-sulfur diesel fuel necessary for electricity generation and&#13;
        transportation neededto maintaineconomic activity, as well as other critical&#13;
        imports. Other imports covered include constructionmaterials and equipment in&#13;
        addition to medical supplies and equipment for the overallreconstruction effort.&#13;
        The inclusiono fthese imports i s based on an assessment o f Grenada's monthly&#13;
        import bill and a review o f satisfactory procurement practices.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
 11.    Rehabilitation and reconstruction of schools (US$5.0 million). One o fthe most&#13;
        urgent reconstructionpriorities o f the govemment is the rebuilding o f damaged or&#13;
        destroyed schools. Only 2 o f the 75 primary and secondary schools on the island&#13;
        are currently inan operational condition. Reconstructionwill be implemented in&#13;
        two phases: an initial rehabilitation phase to make facilities operationally&#13;
        functional where students will be able to attend school on a shift system; and a&#13;
        fullreconstructionphase to complete repairs andbringaffected schools inline&#13;
        with appropriate standards. This component will finance the technical assistance&#13;
        for the design and supervision o f the reconstruction, the actual rehabilitation&#13;
        works, as well as the purchase o f school supplies whenthese have been destroyed&#13;
        or damaged.&#13;
&#13;
 111.   Restoration of St. George's Hospital and regional healthfacilities (US$2.5&#13;
        million). The principal hospital on the island suffered roofdamage resulting in&#13;
        the loss o f its laboratory facility. As this facility is essential to the islandhealth&#13;
        care system, it must be restored as soon as possible. Inthe vicinity o f Grenville,&#13;
        on the eastern side o f the island, Princess Alice Hospital has beenvirtually&#13;
        destroyed. Other health care facilities around the island have been damaged and&#13;
        are inneed o frepairs. This component wilI finance the technical assistance&#13;
        necessary to develop a strategy for addressing rehabilitation works, the physical&#13;
        rehabilitation o f health infrastructure, and the purchase o f medical supplies and&#13;
        equipment when these have been damagedby the Humcane.&#13;
&#13;
IV.     Support to Project Management and Supervision (US$0.5 million). While the&#13;
       project will be implementedby the same PCU currently implementing the&#13;
        ERDMP, ERP, HIV/AIDS and OECS Educationprojects, additional resources&#13;
       will be needed to face the current emergency and increased workload in&#13;
       processing and supervising contracts. This component will finance limited office&#13;
        equipment and technical assistance to support implementation duringthe first year&#13;
        o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT FINANCING&#13;
&#13;
Overall Bank Support to the Recovery Program&#13;
&#13;
The Government o f Grenadahas set up a reconstruction agency andis preparing a&#13;
recovery plan for the country. The proposed project is part o f a US$20 millionrecovery&#13;
packageprepared by the Bank to support this recovery program. Inaddition to the&#13;
US$lO millionreleased under the Phase 4 o f the ERDMP-APL, four Bankprojects under&#13;
implementation inGrenadawill provide funding for the recovery efforts through existing&#13;
components or through amendments.&#13;
&#13;
This includes, (i) reallocationo fUS$450,000 from the EmergencyRecovery Project&#13;
                   the&#13;
(Em)tofinancecriticalimports; (ii) useofUS$3.0millionunderPhase2ofERMDP&#13;

         the&#13;
   US$1.3 millionto respondto additional challenges inthe prevention o f the disease post&#13;
   hurricane Ivan, to provide technical assistance inthe reconstruction efforts andto&#13;
   reconstruct and rehabilitate priority facilities; and (iv) the shifting o f approximately&#13;
   US$5.0 millionunder the OECS EducationDevelopment Program to the reconstruction&#13;
   o f schools.&#13;
&#13;
   Inrecognition ofthe devastation causedbythe hurricane, the donor community quickly&#13;
   mobilized relief efforts inGrenada to assist inthe recovery. Less than one month after&#13;
   Ivanstruck the island, the Government o f Grenada, with the assistance o fthe Bank,&#13;
   organized a donors meeting, on October 4,2004, which coincided with the IMF/World&#13;
   Bank annual meetings. The meeting, which acknowledged the severity o f the emergency,&#13;
   i s expected to generate additional funds for Grenada which will be pledged at a follow-up&#13;
   meeting to take place inthe middle of November. These funds are expectedto support&#13;
   the Government's reconstructionprogram by contributing to these and other&#13;
   rehabilitation efforts.&#13;

  the ERDMPAPL. Under the APL,US$lO million incontingent credit was earmarked&#13;
  for use by a participating country for emergency recovery activities inthe event o f a&#13;
  natural disaster. To access these funds, participating countries must meet three eligibility&#13;
  criteria: (1) the project implementation must be rated as satisfactory at the time o f the&#13;
  disaster; (2) the country must declare a State o f Emergency; and (3) the recognition by&#13;
  the international community o f the emergency nature o f the disaster. Since ERDMP&#13;
  project implementation was rated satisfactory, the Prime Minister declared a State o f&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
  Emergency, andthe international community has respondedwith vigor through an&#13;
  organized reliefeffort andthe successful donors' meeting, Grenada has satisfied all&#13;
  conditions necessaryto access the contingency financing.&#13;
&#13;
  The financing consists o f 50 percent IBRDfunding, and 50 percent IDA credit. Given&#13;
  Grenada's current fiscal constraints, it i s proposed that the Bank finance 100percent o f&#13;
  the project's expenditures. Upto 20% oftotalproject hndsmaybe allocated towards&#13;
  retroactive financing for activities procured after September 7,2004.&#13;
&#13;
  Grenada's current outstanding debt to the Bank i s approximately US$24.9 millionat end&#13;
  September 2004 o fwhich US$6.8 millionrepresent IBRD obligation^.^ This represented&#13;
  for 7 percent o fthe country's external public sector debt of about US$341 million(at the&#13;
  endof2003). Estimated annual debt service obligationsto the Bank (assuming timely&#13;
  full disbursementofthe current portfolio) average US$1.3 millionthrough2040, of&#13;
  which IBRDobligations representUS$1 millionper year through 2018. With the&#13;
  proposed new commitments, annual obligations wouldrise to approximately US$1.6&#13;
  million5through 2040, with the IBRDobligations increasing to around US$1.5 million&#13;
  through 2019. Currently debt obligations to the Bank are being serviced ina timely&#13;
  manner, including arecent post-Ivanpayment ofUS$310,000, although arrearshave&#13;
  emergedonpayments to other creditors and Grenada's external bonds have recently been&#13;
  downgraded from BB-to B-.The Government has recently announced its intention to&#13;
  seek the cooperation o f its creditors duringthe critical reconstruction period. Multilateral&#13;
  debt accounts for 27 percent o fGrenada's external debt and21percent ofits total debt.&#13;
&#13;
  During1997-2000, Grenadawas the bestperforming economy inthe OECS with annual&#13;
  growth rates averaging 7 percent. Although the economy contracted during2001-02&#13;
  owing to the post September 11,2001 contraction intourism and general slowdown in&#13;
  the global economy, prior to HurricaneIvanGrenada hadexperienced asignificant&#13;
  rebound with growth o f 5.7 percent in2003 andwas expected to grow by nearly 4&#13;
  percent in2004. However, the public sector debt-to-GDP ratio reached 113 percent o f&#13;
  GDP on account ofpublic borrowingto finance large investmentprograms. Prior to&#13;
  Hurricane Ivan, the Government has respondedby increasing efforts at fiscal&#13;
  consolidation, including the approval o f a mediumterm programto regain debt&#13;
  sustainability through inter alia re-establishment o f a VAT, significant reductions intax&#13;
  concessions and inpublic expenditure. A primary surplus was achieved for the first time&#13;
  in10years in2003, andthe fiscal deficit improved sharply in2003 from-19 percent of&#13;
  GDP in2002, andwas expected to fall to -5 percent in2004.&#13;
&#13;
 Despite the enormous reconstruction needs, Grenada's mediumterm growth prospects&#13;
remainpositive. The country has achieved a higher level o fdiversification inagricultural&#13;
 exports than its neighbors, and was makinggood progress indiversifying services exports&#13;
 from tourism to ICT-related services. Moreover, a major constraint to growth inthe&#13;
OECS -a shortage o fskilledlabor-i s beingaddressedbythe growth inprivate tertiary&#13;

which US$15.7million would be IBRDlending.&#13;

 education inGrenada. Notably, St. George's Universityhas already resumed classes&#13;
 since the hurricane. It should also be noted that reconstruction can accelerate some o f the&#13;
 necessary structural adjustments, e.g. the replanting o f nutmeg trees will provide an&#13;
 opportunity to use more varieties andrebuilding o f hotels can lead to an upgrading o f the&#13;
physical plant needed to better face new external competition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
 This project will use the same implementation arrangements that are inplace for the&#13;
 current ERDMP, ERP and HIV/AIDS projects with one small modification. The Project&#13;
 Coordinating Unit (PCU) under the purview o f the Ministryo f Finance's will be&#13;
 strengthened andwill work inclose collaboration with the relevant line ministries. The&#13;
P C U(under the Ministry of Finance) will be responsible for the overall coordination o f&#13;
the project. While line agencies will remainresponsible for project implementation, the&#13;
P C Uwill act as a service center, assistingthem with all fiduciary aspects (e.g.&#13;
procurement, contracting, financial reporting and audits) required duringthe execution o f&#13;
the project. The Bank underscored the needto swiftly appoint new staff to the PCU,&#13;
which will be a disbursement condition on the loan.&#13;
&#13;
An actionplan for the strengthening o fthe PCUwas developed duringproject&#13;
preparation, and the Government is takingmeasures to address some o f the deficiencies&#13;
that hadrecently emerged inthe P C Uby appointing an experienced Procurement Officer.&#13;
An additional staffmember is to be appointed and arrangements are beingmade with the&#13;
Government o f Dominica to provide an experienced Procurement Officer to assist in&#13;
project implementation. Additionally, since a qualified accountant must be added to the&#13;
P C Uinorder to implement report based disbursements, the Government is currently&#13;
considering the appointment o f an experienced accountant .&#13;
&#13;
Implementation will also focus on outside donor coordination. The Bank organized an&#13;
initial donor meeting inWashington, D C on October 4 andparticipated inan additional&#13;
donor conference which focused solely on the rehabilitation of the education sector. A&#13;
consultant has beenhiredto assist the Borrower with the organization o f the upcoming&#13;
donor meeting inGrenada to help facilitate successful coordination.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Methods and Special Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
Modifications to the standard procurement methods employed under Bank financing are&#13;
beingproposed to accommodate the emergency nature o fthe project inorder to allow&#13;
rapid sourcing and procurement o f goods and services required for reconstruction, but&#13;
remain within the framework provided under "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD&#13;
Loans and IDA Credits," M a y 2004 and"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of&#13;
Consultants by WorldBank Borrowers,'' M a y 2004.&#13;
&#13;
Inparticular, procurement thresholdsrequiringBankreview andapproval havebeen&#13;
raised and procedures have been slightly relaxedto allow increaseduse o f single source,&#13;

Bank Review andProcurement RiskAssessment&#13;
&#13;
Supervision o f the project will be regular and frequent during the initial 6 month&#13;
implementation period. This will be required due to the emergency nature o f the project&#13;
and the need to assist the P C Uwith its procurement requirements. As the Coordinating&#13;
P C Ucompletes its reorganization and develops its procurement capacity, Bank&#13;
supervision will become less intense. Bank supervision missions are recommended every&#13;
6 months for the first 2 years and annually for the remaining life o fthe project. The&#13;
project i s expected to reach completion by end FY08.&#13;
&#13;
While the procurement procedures have been modifiedto accommodate the disaster, the&#13;
modifications to the P C Uandprocurement centralization provides adequate security for&#13;
the process. This, coupled with frequent Bankreview duringthe initial 6 monthperiod,&#13;
places the overall procurement risk assessment for this project at Average.&#13;
&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
&#13;
The flow o f funds for this project calls for Loadcredit funds to be channeled to the&#13;
project through a Special Account denominated inU S Dollars. This account is to be&#13;
established by the P C Uina commercial bank satisfactory to the Bank. The P C Uwill&#13;
also operate a local currency Special Account to finance project expenditures inlocal&#13;
currency. The account will be managed inaccordance with the procedures and guidelines&#13;
set forth inthe Bank's Disbursement Handbook.&#13;
&#13;
Once a qualified accountant i s appointed to the PCU, disbursements will be made based&#13;
on FMRs. These reports will be submitted to the Bank quarterly, along with a&#13;
withdrawal application allowing for Bank fimds to be periodically transferred to this&#13;
account inan amount to cover no more than 180 days o f projected expenditures.&#13;

auditors and following TOR acceptable to the Bank. The preparation o f a satisfactory&#13;
TOR and o f a letter o f appointment o fthe external auditor for Bankreview and approval&#13;
will be a conditionofdisbursement ofthe loan. The audit report will include supporting&#13;
schedules providing sufficient information on the project ( i.e. Sources and Uses o f&#13;
Funds, Statement o fExpenditures (SOE), andthe Special Account). The amounts in&#13;
these financial statementswould be requiredto be reconciledwith the amounts inthe&#13;
Bank's and IDA'Sdisbursement records. The project's annual audit report i s to be&#13;
submittedto the Bank no later than4 months following the endof the fiscal year (January&#13;
1-December 31).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
 Detailed supporting documentation, including certification, for expenditures will be kept&#13;
 bythe PCUfor at least one fiscal year, after the Bankhas receivedthe audit report for the&#13;
 year inwhich the last withdrawal from the Loan and Credit accounts was made and&#13;
 submittedto the Bank. For all contracts requiring the Bank'sprior review, full&#13;
 documentation will accompany no-objection requests. Detailed documentation will be&#13;
 retainedby the PCU for inspection during supervision missions and for audit by external&#13;
 auditors acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
 Proiect Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
 The initial assessment o f damages inGrenada shows that buildingstructures (housing,&#13;
 schools, government buildings, etc.) were particularly affected. At the same time,&#13;
 structures built or retrofitted inrecent years under World Bank projects survived the&#13;
 storm with little or no damage. This demonstrates the benefits o f applying hurricane&#13;
 resistant standards to vulnerable construction. Strong emphasis will be placed inthe&#13;
 project implementation to ensure that vulnerabilities are not rebuilt. Hurricane resistant&#13;
 standards similar to those used inprevious rehabilitation projects will be applied to the&#13;
 reconstruction of schools and health facilities. In addition to the incorporation o f these&#13;
 standards inBank sponsored construction, it is hopedthe concept will be extended, by&#13;
 example, to non-Bank financed recovery efforts.&#13;
&#13;
 Further strengthening o f disaster management capacity inGrenada will carry onunder the&#13;
 ongoing Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management project to promote additional&#13;
 vulnerability mapping, protection andresponse planning, andthe continued construction&#13;
 o f physical mitigationworks.&#13;
&#13;
 Monitoring Indicators&#13;
&#13;
 A progress report, including aprocurementplanand actionmatrix will beproduced and&#13;
 sent to the Bank every 6 months. Reporting needs will be reviewed at the beginning o f&#13;
 each fiscal year. Outcome indicators will include: (i)  the successful importation o f low-&#13;
 sulfur diesel fuel for energy production and transport, as well as other critical goods such&#13;
 as construction materials and equipment needed for the overall reconstruction effort; (ii)&#13;
the number o f students who have retumed to school, on a quarterly basis; and (iii)    the&#13;
number ofhospital beds that have beenrehabilitated to an operational level, on a&#13;
quarterly basis.&#13;
&#13;
Safeguards&#13;
&#13;
The project is classified as Category B. No adverse environmental or social issues have&#13;
been identified. However, it isjudged prudent to keep some environmental oversight in&#13;
view o f the potential impacts o fthe rehabilitation or reconstruction of community&#13;
infrastructure. Because o f the emergency nature of this project, it is proposed that,&#13;
pursuant to OP 8.50, the project be relieved from OP 4.01 requirements, with adequate&#13;
justifications included inthe loan document. Appropriate Environmental Assessments&#13;

            Grenada - Hurricane Ivan Emergency Recovery
            - Phase IV - Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Hurricane Ivan Emergency Recovery
            Project will make US$10 million available to Grenada, for
            use in the reconstruction, available under the fourth phase
            of the Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Adaptable
            Program Loan (APL), to which Grenada is a participant.
            Damage to Grenada as a result of Hurricane Ivan was
            extensive. A comprehensive damage assessment prepared by the
            Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), in
            collaboration with the United Nations Economic Commission
            for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), puts the total
            damages at US$900 million, more than twice the
            country's GDP. Health and education infrastructure was
            particularly impacted, with the second biggest hospital, and
            most schools on the island rendered unusable. The project
            will provide the additional funds, available to support the
            overall recovery program, through the financing of critical
            imports, the rehabilitation of schools and education
            infrastructure, and recovery activities in the health
            sector. The focus of this project will therefore be to
            rehabilitate infrastructure in these areas. The project
            components include: I) Financing of critical imports; II)
            Assistance to the recovery of the education sector; III)
            Assistance to the recovery of the health sector; and, IV)
            Support to Project Management and Supervision.
