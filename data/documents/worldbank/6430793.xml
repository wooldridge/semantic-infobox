The Little Green Data Book 2005 is based on World Development Indicators&#13;
&#13;
2005 and its accompanying CD-ROM. Defining, gathering, and disseminating&#13;
&#13;
international statistics is a collective effort of many people and organizations.&#13;
&#13;
The indicators presented in World Development Indicators are the fruit of&#13;
&#13;
decades of work at many levels, from the field workers who administer&#13;
&#13;
censuses and household surveys to the committees and working parties of&#13;
&#13;
the national and international statistical agencies that develop the nomen-&#13;
&#13;
clature, classifications, and standards fundamental to the international sta-&#13;
&#13;
tistical system. Nongovernmental organizations have also made important&#13;
&#13;
contributions. We are indebted to the World Development Indicators network&#13;
&#13;
of partners, as detailed in World Development Indicators 2005. The financial&#13;
&#13;
assistance of the Government of Sweden is gratefully acknowledged.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Little Green Data Book is the result of close collaboration between the&#13;
&#13;
staff of the Environment Department and the Development Economics Data&#13;
&#13;
Group. Mehdi Akhlaghi, Mahyar Eshragh-Tabary, Richard Fix, Kirk Hamilton,&#13;
&#13;
Saeed Ordoubadi, Giovanni Ruta, and Alexandra Sears contributed to its&#13;
&#13;
preparation. Jim Cantrell designed the cover. Cover photographs are from Kirk&#13;
&#13;
Hamilton and the World Bank photo archives. The book was edited, designed,&#13;
&#13;
and laid out by Meta de Coquereaumont, Christopher Trott, and Elaine Wilson&#13;
&#13;
of Communications Development Incorporated in Washington, D.C.&#13;

&#13;
The 2005 edition of The Little Green Data Book coincides with important trans-&#13;
&#13;
formations linked to sustainable development. This year will be remembered&#13;
&#13;
for the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol. It also marked a renewed com-&#13;
&#13;
mitment by the G-8 countries to foster development in Africa. Finally, this year&#13;
&#13;
will witness the reconstruction efforts following the tsunami disaster in South&#13;
&#13;
and East Asia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Development and poverty alleviation--the World Bank's mission--call for a&#13;
&#13;
long-term vision. Enhancing environmental quality, improving natural resource&#13;
&#13;
management, and maintaining global ecosystems are all important steps&#13;
&#13;
toward this goal. Better environmental management can improve people's&#13;
&#13;
livelihoods, health, and security today and in the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To achieve these lasting results we need to start from a sound base of infor-&#13;
&#13;
mation that helps us set priorities and measure progress toward environ-&#13;
&#13;
mental sustainability goals. The Little Green Data Book is a step in this&#13;
&#13;
direction, with key indicators of the environment and its relationship to peo-&#13;
&#13;
ple for more than 200 countries. This year's edition includes new indicators&#13;
&#13;
for fish catch, in the agriculture and fisheries section, and biomass fuel use,&#13;
&#13;
in the energy section. While there are gaps and shortcomings in the data, we&#13;
&#13;
hope this book will inspire decisionmakers at all levels to use this informa-&#13;
&#13;
tion and to seek to fill the gaps for their own countries. We welcome your sug-&#13;
&#13;
gestions on how future editions can be improved and made more useful.&#13;

Data notes&#13;
&#13;
The data in this book are for the most recent year for which data are available&#13;
&#13;
between 1999 and 2003, unless otherwise noted in the glossary. Regional&#13;
&#13;
aggregates include data for low- and middle-income economies only. Aggregates&#13;
&#13;
for regions and income groups are shown only if data are available for 66 per-&#13;
&#13;
cent of the economies in that group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Symbols used:&#13;
&#13;
          ..   means that data are not available or that aggregates cannot be&#13;
&#13;
               calculated because of missing data.&#13;
&#13;
   0 or 0.0    means zero or less than half the unit shown.&#13;
&#13;
          $    means current U.S. dollars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data are shown for economies with populations greater than 30,000 and for&#13;
&#13;
smaller economies if they are members of the World Bank. The term country&#13;
&#13;
(used interchangeably with economy) does not imply political independence&#13;
&#13;
or official recognition by the World Bank but refers to any economy for which&#13;
&#13;
the authorities report separate social or economic statistics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In keeping with World Development Indicators 2005, The Little Green Data Book&#13;
&#13;
2005 uses terminology in line with the 1993 System of National Accounts&#13;
&#13;
(SNA). In particular, gross national income (GNI) is used in place of gross&#13;
&#13;
national product (GNP).&#13;

                    Income group tables&#13;
&#13;
For operational and analytical purposes the World Bank's main criterion for&#13;
&#13;
classifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita. Every econ-&#13;
&#13;
omy is classified as low income, middle income (subdivided into lower middle&#13;
&#13;
and upper middle), or high income. Low- and middle-income economies are&#13;
&#13;
sometimes referred to as developing economies. The use of the term is con-&#13;
&#13;
venient; it is not intended to imply that all economies in the group are expe-&#13;
&#13;
riencing similar development or that other economies have reached a&#13;
&#13;
preferred or final stage of development. Note that classification by income&#13;
&#13;
does not necessarily reflect development status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Low-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $765 or less in 2003.&#13;
&#13;
Middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of more than $765&#13;
&#13;
but less than $9,386.&#13;
&#13;
Lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income economies are separated at&#13;
&#13;
a GNI per capita of $3,035.&#13;
&#13;
High-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $9,386 or more.&#13;

Glossary&#13;
Access to an improved water source refers to the share of the population with&#13;
   reasonable access to an adequate amount of water from an improved&#13;
   source, such as a household connection, public standpipe, borehole, pro-&#13;
   tected well or spring, or rainwater collection. Unimproved sources include&#13;
   vendors, tanker trucks, and unprotected wells and springs. Reasonable&#13;
   access to an adequate amount is defined as the availability of at least 20&#13;
   liters a person a day from a source within one kilometer of the dwelling.&#13;
   (World Health Organization; the data are for 2002)&#13;
&#13;
Access to sanitation is the share of population with access to at least ade-&#13;
   quate excreta disposal facilities (private or shared, but not public) that can&#13;
   effectively prevent human, animal, and insect contact with excreta.&#13;
   Improved facilities range from simple but protected pit latrines to flush toi-&#13;
   lets with a sewerage connection. To be effective, facilities must be cor-&#13;
   rectly constructed and properly maintained. (World Health Organization;&#13;
   the data are for 2002)&#13;
&#13;
Adjusted net savings are equal to gross national savings minus consumption of&#13;
   fixed capital, plus education expenditures and minus energy depletion, min-&#13;
   eral depletion, net forest depletion, and particulate matter and carbon diox-&#13;
   ide damage. In cases where data are not available, adjusted net savings do&#13;
   not include particulate emission damage. (World Bank; the data are for 2003)&#13;
&#13;
Agricultural land refers to the share of land area that is arable, under per-&#13;

   mowing or for pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land&#13;
   temporarily fallow. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is&#13;
   excluded. Land under permanent crops is land cultivated with crops that&#13;
   occupy the land for long periods and need not be replanted after each har-&#13;
   vest, such as cocoa, coffee, and rubber. This category includes land under&#13;
   flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, but excludes land under&#13;
   trees grown for wood or timber. Permanent pasture is land used for five&#13;

   toral analysis of conservation and resource management issues to help&#13;
   integrate environmental concerns into the development process. They&#13;
   include national conservation strategies, national environmental action&#13;
   plans, national environmental management strategies, and national sus-&#13;
   tainable development strategies. The year shown for a country refers to the&#13;
   year in which a strategy or action plan was adopted. (World Resources&#13;
   Institute, International Institute for Environment and Development, World&#13;
   Conservation Monitoring CenterÂ­IUCN, and World Bank)&#13;
&#13;

   of arable land. Fertilizer products cover nitrogenous, potash, and phos-&#13;
   phate fertilizers (including ground rock phosphate). The time reference for&#13;
   fertilizer consumption is the crop year (July through June). (Food and&#13;
   Agriculture Organization; the data are for 2002)&#13;
&#13;

Freshwater withdrawals, total, refer to total water withdrawal, not counting&#13;
    evaporation losses from storage basins. Withdrawals also include water&#13;
    from desalination plants in countries where they are a significant source.&#13;
    Withdrawals can exceed 100 percent of internal renewable resources where&#13;
    extraction from nonrenewable aquifers or desalination plants is consider-&#13;
    able, where there is significant water reuse, or where there are significant&#13;

    try, regardless of the allocation to domestic and foreign claims. GDP at pur-&#13;
    chaser values (market prices) is the sum of gross value added by all resident&#13;
    and nonresident producers in the economy plus any taxes and minus any&#13;
    subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without&#13;
    making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and&#13;
    degradation of natural resources. (World Bank, Organisation for Economic&#13;
    Co-operation and Development, United Nations; the data are for 2003)&#13;
&#13;
GNI per capita is gross national income (formerly called gross national prod-&#13;
    uct or GNP) divided by midyear population. GNI is the sum of gross value&#13;
    added by all resident producers plus any taxes (less subsidies) that are&#13;
    not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income&#13;
    (employee compensation and property income) from nonresident&#13;
    sources. GNI per capita is in current U.S. dollars, converted using the&#13;
    World Bank Atlas method; see Statistical Methods in World Development&#13;

   nickel, phosphate, tin, gold, silver, and zinc. (A wide range of data sources&#13;
   and estimation methods used to arrive at resource depletion estimates&#13;
   are described in a 1998 World Bank working paper entitled "Estimating&#13;
   National Wealth;" the data are for 2003)&#13;
&#13;
Nationally protected areas are totally or partially protected areas of at least&#13;
   1,000 hectares that are designated as national parks, natural monu-&#13;
   ments, nature reserves or wildlife sanctuaries, protected landscapes and&#13;
   seascapes, or scientific reserves. (World Conservation Monitoring&#13;
   CenterÂ­IUCN; the data are preliminary, and they are for most recent year&#13;
   reported in 2003)&#13;
&#13;
Net forest depletion is calculated as the product of unit resource rents and&#13;
   the excess of roundwood harvest over natural growth. If growth exceeds&#13;
   harvest, this figure is zero. (Food and Agriculture Organization, World Bank&#13;
   estimates of natural growth; the data are for 2003)&#13;
&#13;
Particulate matter refers to fine suspended particulates less than 10 microns&#13;
   in diameter that are capable of penetrating deep into the respiratory tract&#13;
   and causing damage. It is the population weighted average of all cities in&#13;
   the country with a population in excess of 100,000. (World Bank esti-&#13;
   mates; the data are for 1999)&#13;

&#13;
Population includes all residents who are present regardless of legal status&#13;
   or citizenship--except for refugees not permanently settled in the coun-&#13;
   try of asylum, who are generally considered part of the population of their&#13;
   country of origin. The values shown are midyear estimates. (World Bank,&#13;
   United Nations; the data are for 2003)&#13;
&#13;
Population density, rural, is the rural population divided by the arable land area.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Little Green Data Book 2005 is based
            on the World Development Indicators 2005, and represents an
            abbreviated collection of information. Its production is a
            collaboration between the Development Economics Data
            Development Group, and the Environment Department of the
            World Bank. Development and poverty alleviation-the World
            Bank's mission-call for a long-term vision. Enhancing
            environmental quality, improving natural resource
            management, and maintaining global ecosystems are all
            important steps toward this goal. To achieve these lasting
            results we need to start from a sound base of information
            that helps us set priorities and measure progress toward
            environmental sustainability goals. The Little Green Data
            Book is a step in this direction, with key indicators of the
            environment and its relationship to people for more than 200
            countries. This year's edition includes new indicators
            for fish catch, in the agriculture and fisheries section,
            and biomass fuel use, in the energy section. While there are
            gaps and shortcomings in the data, we hope this book will
            inspire decision makers at all levels to use this
            information and to seek to fill the gaps for their own
            countries. This year will be remembered for the entry into
            force of the Kyoto Protocol. It also marked a renewed
            commitment by the G-8 countries to foster development in
            Africa. Finally, this year will witness the reconstruction
            efforts following the tsunami disaster in South and East Asia.
