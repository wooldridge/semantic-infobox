Abstract&#13;
Exchange rate policies of nine countries in Africa during the post-&#13;
independence period are examined.      Governments in these countries&#13;
did not look upon the exchange rate as a major policy instrument and&#13;
the paper reviews the impact of this neglect on worsening economic&#13;
growth and the balance of payments towards the end of the 1970s and&#13;
the early 1980s.    Even today many African governments believe that&#13;
devaluation will accentuate inflation, exacerbate budget deficits&#13;
and yield few benefits in terms of increased exports or lower im-&#13;
ports.   It is argued that such general scepticism is misplaced and&#13;
that the effectiveness of exchange rate policy depends on how well&#13;
it is designed and implemented.    The paper concludes by pointing out&#13;
that the pursuit of a dynamic exchange rate policy is an essential&#13;
component in a policy package aimed at structural adjustment.&#13;

Cette etude examine les politiques de taux de change de neuf pays d'Afrique&#13;
depuis leur accession a l'ind6pendance. Les gouvernements de ces pays&#13;
n'ont pas considere le taux de change comme un important instrument de&#13;
politique, et cette etude analyse comment cette negligence a ralenti leur&#13;
croissance 6conomique et aggrav6 le desequilibre de leur balance des paie-&#13;
ments vers la fin des annees 70 et le debut des annees 80. Aujourd'hui&#13;
encore, de nombreux gouvernements africains croient qu'une d6valuation ne&#13;
peut que precipiter l'inflation et creuser leur d6ficit budgetaire, en ne&#13;
leur permettant que moderement d'accroitre leurs exportations et de reduire&#13;
leurs importations0 Les auteurs font observer qu'un tel scepticisme n'est&#13;
pas de mise et que l'efficacit6 de la politique de taux de change depend&#13;
de la fagon dont elle est conque et appliqu6e. Ils concluent en souli-&#13;
gnant que l'application d'une politique de taux de change dynamique est un&#13;
element essentiel de tout ensemble de mesures d'ajustement structurel.&#13;

Extracto&#13;
En este documento se analizan las politicas cambiarias de nueve paises de&#13;
Africa durante el periodo posterior a su independencia.      Los gobiernos de&#13;
esos paises no consideraron el tipo de cambio como un instrumento impor-&#13;
tante de politica, y en el documento se examina la influencia de esa&#13;
omisi6n en el deterioro de su crecimiento econ6mico y de su balanza de&#13;
pagos en los ultimos afios del decenio de 1970 y en los primeros del&#13;
actual. Incluso hoy en dia muchos gobiernos africanos creen que la deva-&#13;
luaci6n acentuaria la inflaci6n, exacerbaria los deficit presupuestarios y&#13;
rendiria pocos beneficios en terminos de aumento de las exportaciones o de&#13;
reducci6n de las importaciones.    En el documento se arguye que ese escep-&#13;
ticismo general no esta justificado y que la eficacia de la politica cam-&#13;
biaria depende de que 6sta se formule y aplique en forma satisfactoria.&#13;
Como conclusi6n, se seiiala que una politica cambiaria dinamica es un ele-&#13;
mento esencial de un conjunto integrado de politicas encaminadas a lograr&#13;
el ajuste estructural.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
1.        For much of the post-independence period, our nine sample&#13;
countries did not pursue an active exchange rate policy.         It was&#13;
only in the last three or four years that several governments began&#13;
to experiment with this policy instrument.       Our aim is to survey&#13;
this history and take stock of accumulated experience so far.      What&#13;
were the costs of neglecting the exchange rate in the late 1960s and&#13;
much of the 1970s?    What has been achieved so far during the brief&#13;
period of active exchange rate management that began at the very end&#13;
of the decade? What lessons can be drawn for future policy?&#13;
I. The Bretton Woods Period: 1965-1973&#13;
2.      By and large the late 1960s and early 1970s was a period of&#13;
domestic price and exchange rate stability.       Currencies of former&#13;
British colonies were pegged to the U.K. pound in the first instance&#13;
but many of them failed to devalue when sterling fell by 14% in 1967&#13;
(Table 1). Indeed, Malawi was the only country in our sample which&#13;
maintained its relative value to the U.K. pound at that time. Many&#13;
of these countries switched their peg to the U.S. dollar before the&#13;
end of the 1960s, while Malawi and Tanzania adhered to sterling and&#13;
later switched to the SDR.     When the U.S. dollar was devalued in&#13;
1971 and 1973, most of these countries followed suit; the exception&#13;
was Zambia which kept the kwacha pegged to the SDR and thereby&#13;
appreciated it against the dollar in 1973.&#13;

3.        The Ethiopian Birr and the Somali shilling were pegged to&#13;
the UOSO dollar from as early as 1965 but these currencies did not&#13;
follow the dollar's realignment in the early 1970s. Ethiopia appre-&#13;
ciated its currency by 20% vis-a-vis the dollar and Somalia by 14%o&#13;
Although the Sudan pound was pegged to the U.K. pound in the early&#13;
years, it followed the U.S. dollar throughout this period.&#13;
4.      The Malagasy franc was pegged to the French franc throughout&#13;
this period and followed its course.&#13;
5O      This brief history demonstrates that African governEents did&#13;
not look upon the exchange rate as a major instrument for economic&#13;
management during this period. Confronted with the U.K. devaluation&#13;
in 1967, the French one in 1969 or the dollar devaluation in the&#13;
early 1970s they made a choice as to whether or not to follow the&#13;
peg currency. But that was all.     To illustrate, let us exanine the&#13;
decision of Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and the Sudan to follow the&#13;
devaluation of the U.S. dollar in 1971 and to let their currencies&#13;
depreciate by 8% vis-a-vis     the SDRo    Did economic circuEntances&#13;
prevailing in these countries justify a uniform amount of deprecia-&#13;
tion? Some key indicators are summarized in Table 20&#13;
60        The economic situation in the four countries had tuo fea-&#13;
tures in commono     First, GDP in real terms was growing feÂ£ter on&#13;
average than the rate of population growtho         Secondly, external&#13;
reserves declined sharply in 1970 or 1971.       But in other respects&#13;
the economic situation was quite diverse0         GDP was  rising much&#13;
faster in Kenya than in the other three countrieso        Inflation was&#13;
low but rising in Kenya and high and rising in Ugandao      In Tanzania&#13;
and the Sudan, price increases had registered double-digit figures&#13;

in 1969 but the next two years had seen impressive progress towards&#13;
stabilization. The current account of the balance of payments show-&#13;
ed a rapidly rising deficit, fueled by large increases in imports,&#13;
in Kenya9 Tanzania, and Uganda. By contrast, in the Sudan, the same&#13;
deficit as a share of GDP was low and imports were falling behind&#13;
the growth of GDP. The USA's share in total trade was rather low,&#13;
except in Uganda. It was not easy to see the logic of the simulta-&#13;
neous 8% devaluation by all four governments in 1971; it can only be&#13;
interpreted as a mechanical response to the movement of the U.S.&#13;
dollar.&#13;
7.        Over the entire period 1965-73, the record of local price&#13;
movements and exchange rate changes is summarized in Table 3.        Both&#13;
these measurements   are subject    to some qualifications0     Consumer&#13;
price  indices  in sample   countries   are of varying quality0       The&#13;
basket of consumer goods has ceased to be representative in many&#13;
instances0 Quite often the index reflects price movements in one or&#13;
two cities rather than the country-wide situation0 The introduction&#13;
and spread of price controls, particularly in the post 1973 period,&#13;
have made CPIs even more treacherous0      As far as exchange rates are&#13;
concerned, they can be measured bilaterally (vis a vis the U.S.&#13;
dollar)  or on a multilateral     basis, taking account of all major&#13;
trading partners and their relative      shares   in total exports    and&#13;
imports of each sample country0     For the sake of simplicity we have&#13;
opted for the bilateral rate vis a vis the U.S. dollaro         For most&#13;
countries and for much of the period the two methods do not yield&#13;
contradictory results as far as the direction of change is concern-&#13;
ed, although the magnitudes of exchange rate changes are, of course,&#13;

affected.   Inflation was above 5% per annum in five cases, compared&#13;
to 3.4% per annum in the USA.1/     Nominal exchange rates (vis-a-vis&#13;
the dollar) appreciated significantly in Zambia and Madagascar and&#13;
less markedly in Uganda and Tanzania.        The appreciation in real&#13;
effective terms (i.e. after allowing for differential inflation) was&#13;
more than 20% in Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, the Sudan, and Malawi.&#13;
Since this paper was completed, weights in the U.S. CPI have been&#13;
revised.   The new index yields an average annual inflation rate&#13;
of 4.4% during 1965-73.&#13;

I., The High Inflation Period&#13;
80      The breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange&#13;
rates made economic management much more complex than before for&#13;
developing countries who now had to adapt to a world in which major&#13;
currencies were floating.2/ African countries in our sample took a&#13;
fairly long time to adjust to the new situation. For many years they&#13;
were content to tie down the value of their currencies to the SDRP&#13;
the dollar or the French franc and to let the realignment of major&#13;
currencies determine the price of foreign exchange in their econo-&#13;
mieso The Sudan followed this passive policy till 1977, Somalia and&#13;
Madagascar till 1981 and Ethiopia pursues this policy even in 19840&#13;
Malawi, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda made somE adjustments in the mid-&#13;
1970s and then adopted a passive posture for the rest of the&#13;
decade.   Zambia devalued in 1976 and 1978 but then became inactive&#13;
during 1979-1982.    Very few countries in our sample attempted to&#13;
actively manage their exchange rates till recently.&#13;
9.        The period after 1973 was one of escalating global infla-&#13;
tiono The U.S. consumer price index, for examples, rose at an&#13;
average annual rate of more than 11% during 1973-79 and of nearly&#13;
10% in 1979-19820    Correspondingly, most countries in our sample&#13;
experienced double digit inflation (see Table 4)o Indeed, the pace&#13;
of inflation was considerably higher than in the USA and sample&#13;
countries devalued substantially in nominal terms. In several cases&#13;

tradeables), exports and imports.      The rate of expansion of GDP&#13;
since the mid=1970s slowed down markedly ln Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda,&#13;
Zambia and Ethiopia0    By contrast, Sudan and Somalia achieved much&#13;
higher growth rates in the late 1970s and early 1980s, compared to&#13;
the earlier periodo    Madagascar stagnated and Malawi maintained a&#13;
pace of expansion above 5% poao throughout the period.&#13;
110        Many factors were responsible for the diverse economic&#13;
record.   Amongst them should be counted the two major oil price&#13;
increases, the fluctuations and trends in non-oil commodity prices,&#13;
the rapid expansion and recent setback in ODA, the droughts in the&#13;
mid-1970s and again in the early 1980s and the collapse of the East&#13;
African Common Market in 1977o In addition to such influences which&#13;
affected all or many sample countries , there w-ere country-specific&#13;
events such as exhaustion of land with high potential in Kenya, the&#13;
traumatic Amin period in Uganda, the Marxist-Leninist revolution in&#13;
Ethiopia, etc0    In the presence of such powerful socio-political1,&#13;
natural resource, climatic and economic factors we cannot expect to&#13;
deduce any strong relationships between growth trends and the real&#13;
exchange rate0 Nevertheless, this variable has been plotted in each&#13;
country graph together with the share of commodity production,&#13;
exports. and imports in GDPo&#13;
12.      We want to draw attention to the following points without&#13;
claiming much by way of causal relationships;&#13;
-    The country with the best growth records, le. Malawi did not&#13;
experience any serious appreciation in the real exchange&#13;
rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
The Kenyan real exchange rate did not appreciate till the&#13;
late 1970s, when its GDP growth also received a set back.&#13;
The ratio of exports to GDP started to decline in 1970 and&#13;
this fall has continued till recent years.&#13;
The Tanzanian real exchange rate started to appreciate in&#13;
the mid-sixties and this trend has continued throughout the&#13;
period under study. Ratios of commodity production, exports&#13;
and imports to GDP have declined sharply.&#13;
The  Ethiopian  exchange   rate  started  appreciating  in the&#13;
secondhalf of the 1970s; this coincided with a substantial&#13;
deceleration in the GDP growth rate and decline in the ratio&#13;
of exports to GDP.&#13;
Madagascar experienced real exchange rate appreciation and&#13;
economic stagnation throughout the 1970s.&#13;
Sudan's real exchange rate started to appreciate early in&#13;
the 1970s and this trend continued till 1978.         In later&#13;
years there was no further appreciation.     Meanwhile, avail-&#13;
able data show a marked      acceleration  in GDP and    import&#13;
growth   in  the  later  period   while  exports  declined   in&#13;
absolute terms. These divergent trends suggest that Sudan's&#13;
fast GDP growth was at the expense of a rapidly growing&#13;
external debt and very acute debt servicing difficulties.&#13;
Somali data is incomplete but the story is very much the&#13;
same as that of the Sudan.     The Somali shilling started to&#13;
appreciate in real terms in the later 1970s, accompanied by&#13;
faster GDP and import growth while exports declined precipi-&#13;
tously.&#13;
&#13;

130     Exporters of primary commodities in several sample countries&#13;
were confronted by a situation in which their receipts in home&#13;
currency, per unit of sale, failed to keep pace with local prices&#13;
they had to pay.     This worsening of the local terms of trade of&#13;
exporters was the result not only of a passive exchange rate policy&#13;
but also of trade regimes that raised local prices of import substi-&#13;
tutes (processed foods, textiles, other light consumer goods,&#13;
construction materials) far above their international level04/&#13;
Furthermore, a growing part of the export price in local currency&#13;
was diverted through government policy to meet the rising costs of&#13;
marketing parastatals.5/ All told, this combination of factors took&#13;
a heavy toll and incentives for cash crop production for exports&#13;
plungedo   The results were all too evident in the statistics Which&#13;
showed a major slowing down in growth or even an absolute decline in&#13;
the volume of exports during the 1970s and early 1980so&#13;
140      Export earnings were affected by fluctuations in interna-&#13;
tional prices as well as by a setback in quantities produced and&#13;
sold.    And commodity prices    in dollar   terms  fell substuantially&#13;
towards the end of the period under review0      Stagnation o: slowing&#13;
down of export earnings did not lead immediately to an equivalent&#13;
contraction in imports.    Export revenues financed a far lower share&#13;
of the import bill at the end of the period than at its beginning&#13;
(see Table 6).    Increasing official   development   assistance helped&#13;

sustain imports to some extent and for some time, particularly in&#13;
countries such as Somalia, Tanzania and the Sudan.      In other cases,&#13;
(Kenya, Zambia and Madagascar are examples), a significant part of&#13;
imports were financed by external borrowing on market terms.&#13;
15.      The failure to adjust exchange rates adequately meant that&#13;
there was a relative decline in local currency prices of imports&#13;

(except those competing with local production) compared to prices of&#13;
non-tradeables. These price movements encouraged the use of capital&#13;
equipment instead of labor, imported intermediate goods instead of&#13;
local materials and imported consumer goods instead of indigenous&#13;
substitutes. We could cite many examples of these trends, although&#13;
available data does not permit an econometric validation of this&#13;
statement.   Attention should be drawn, in this context, to the (i)&#13;
virtual absence of animal drawn^ transport and animal traction in&#13;
agriculture and the predominance of imported vehicles using imported&#13;
fuel, (ii) widespread use of imported materials in urban as well as&#13;
modern, rural construction; (iii) heavy dependence of manufacturing&#13;
production on imported inputs;6/ (iv) growing preference for import-&#13;
ed cereals as against maize, cassava and sorghum.&#13;
160     Imports into sample countries could not be sustained indefi-&#13;
nitely in the face of the setback in exports.      The expansion of ODA&#13;
lost its momentum and difficulties in honoring payments due discour-&#13;
aged commercial lenders.     The scarcity of foreign exchange and of&#13;
imported goods became an overwhelming fact of life0         Governments&#13;
recognized this not by raising adequately the price of foreign&#13;
exchange but by imposing surcharges on imports, imposing import&#13;
quotas, and multiplying payment restrictions. Even holders of valid&#13;
import licenses had to queue up for foreign exchange.        T'he acute&#13;
crisis was also reflected in the emergence in many countries of a&#13;
sizeable  parallel   market  for   foreign  exchange   (or for imported&#13;

Also, the impetus to smuggle exports or to under-invoice them and to&#13;
over-invoice imports or to smuggle them gathered strength.&#13;
III. Will an Active Exchange Rate Policy Work?&#13;
17.     Some policy makers in Africa argue that the emphasis on the&#13;
passivity of the exchange rate as an explanation of current diffi-&#13;
culties is quite misplaced. According to this view:&#13;
(i)  an attempt to change the real effective exchange rate will&#13;
not succeed owing to the inflationary consequences of a&#13;
nominal devaluation, futhermore, devaluation will exacerbate&#13;
budget deficits;&#13;
(ii)  production is not price elastic; and&#13;
(iii)  total imports are not sensitive to the exchange rate and&#13;
their detailed allocation should be governed by national&#13;
priorities rather than left to the market mechanism.&#13;
These assertions are not without some validity, under African cir-&#13;
cumstances.&#13;
The Link Between Devaluation, Inflation and the Budget&#13;
18.      Let us first examine the assertion that the real effective&#13;
exchange rate cannot be changed at all.        Kenen tells us that a&#13;
similar view was taken not too long ago by a Governor of the Bank of&#13;
England and indeed by many members of the Group of Thirty.7/        The&#13;
idea that devaluation can trtgger a vicious circle involving a rise&#13;
7/ Kenen, P.B., "Exchange Rates, Domestic Prices, and the Adjustment&#13;
Process," Group of Thirty, Occasional Paper No. 1, 1980.&#13;

22 -&#13;
in domestic prices, triggering off a wage-price spiral is all too&#13;
familiar.   Nevertheless, Kenen strikes an optimistic note when he&#13;
summarizes the results of econometric evidence for high-income&#13;
industrialized countries." 0 0 0 a change in the nominal exchange&#13;
rate does produce a change in the real exchange rate.        Tne latter&#13;
will be smaller than the former and may be very small for small open&#13;
economies, but it need not be trivial or transitory."         A similar&#13;
conclusion is reached by Graham Bird 8/ after reviewing a number of&#13;
studies of devaluation in developing countries0 Exchange rate&#13;
changes in nominal terms can spark off domestic cost inflation,&#13;
thereby preventing a real devaluation;      but, this is not Inevita-&#13;
ble0   Much depends on the content of the policy package o.f which&#13;
exchange rate changes are a parto       Appropriate fiscal, D  nnetary,&#13;
wage and price policies can reinforce the impact sought through&#13;
changes in exchange rates and bring about a devaluation in the real&#13;
exchange rate0&#13;
19o     Consider, for example the fiscal issueo    The sharp accelera-&#13;
tion in the pace of inflation reflected in Table 4 was partly the&#13;
result of higher international inflatlon in the wake of the first&#13;
oil price rise0     It also reflected a major expansion in budget&#13;
deficits0    Large  scale borrowing   by governments    from benks was&#13;
accomodated partly by restricting credit to the private sector and&#13;
partly by a higher rate of monetary expansion.      Attempts to stabi-&#13;
lize the economy, in this context, have to combine budget restraint&#13;

with devaluation. One view common in African policy circles is that&#13;
devaluation per se will exacerbate budgetary problems.&#13;
20.         One immediate impact    of devaluation will be to raise&#13;
governments receipts by expanding the local currency value of the&#13;
base   for  import  and   export  taxes.     These  taxes,   typically,&#13;
constitute a substantial portion of total government receipts in low&#13;
income countries.    The median share of import taxes in our sample&#13;
was 20% with some countries showing ratios in the 40-50% range&#13;
(Table 7).   The corresponding median share of export taxes was only&#13;
3% with Uganda and Ethiopia showing very high ratios. This positive&#13;
impact of devaluation on government revenues will be diluted to the&#13;
extent trade taxes are specific rather than ad valorem; and to the&#13;
extent that there exist exemptions from import duties.8/        Another&#13;
immediate impact of devaluation will be to raise the local currency&#13;
value of foreign capital inflows (loans &amp; grants).       These receipts&#13;
constituted a large share of the total in 5 of our 9 sample&#13;
countries.   To the extent that foreign aid finances local costs in&#13;
many African countries, its revaluation should yield a net benefit&#13;
for the budget.&#13;
21.     Devaluation also means a corresponding increase in the local&#13;
currency value of the import component of public expenditure.       The&#13;
item of public expenditure which is all in foreign exchange is debt&#13;
service  on   foreign  borrowing.    Such  outlays   have been  growing&#13;
8/ Exemptions have grown in the past decade and constitute a&#13;
substantial  revenue  loss.    On   this  point,  see  "Taxation  in&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa," Occasional Paper No. 8, IMF (October 1981)&#13;

rapidly and can be quite large (see Table 7), particulary if account&#13;
is taken not only of central government obligations but also of debt&#13;
guaranteed by government.     In addition, capital outlays have size-&#13;
able import components; the median share of this in our sample is&#13;
24%. While devaluation can be expected to raise the value of import&#13;
intensive public outlays substantially in the first instance, it&#13;
will also improve immediately the financial position of parastatals&#13;
in the export sector and thereby reduce the need for loans or&#13;
subsidies from governments.&#13;
22.       We can conclude that the common African perception that&#13;
devaluation will exacerbate the budgetary problem is not valid.&#13;
First, even the immediate and more or less mechanical impact on a&#13;
net basis is difficult to determine a priori.         Devaluation will&#13;
trigger a number of partly offsetting repercussions and the net&#13;
outcome will   depend on the country's specific situation.        Model&#13;
exercises along these lines in India yielded a net positive impact&#13;
while in Israel the opposite result was obtained.9/         Secondly,  a&#13;
distinction should be drawn between the immediate net impact and the&#13;
longer-run effect taking account of relevant elasticities and of&#13;
discretionary   changes  in  outlays  or  revenues.    Even where   the&#13;
immediate net impact is negative, the longer run effect can be to&#13;
strengthen the budget.   Thirdly, the exchange rate change per se can&#13;
be designed in such a way that the government financial position is&#13;

ment Budget," unpublished, IMF (July 7, 1972).&#13;

protected; for example, dual or multiple rates can be introduced&#13;
with this objective in mind010/&#13;
23.      No systematic evaluation of African experience is available&#13;
but there is some evidence to suggest that real exchange rates can&#13;
be depreciated.    Uganda has tried to reorder its foreign exchange&#13;
market after many years of neglect.    The official rate was devalued&#13;
very sharply in 1981 and more moderately in 1982 and 1983 (Table&#13;
1). Also, a second window was lntroduced as a transitional device&#13;
at which foreign exchange earned by exporters of goods and services&#13;
other than coffee and cotton as well as a part of the foreign&#13;
exchange borrowed from the IMF was auctioned to importers of good&#13;
and services other than petroleum0     The rate of inflation was very&#13;
high in 1980 and 1981, but it has fallen substantially since then0&#13;
The budget deficit financed from the banking system was at a very&#13;
high level of 71% of total government expenditures in 1981 but this&#13;
proportion fell to 37% in 1982,      The real effective exchange rate&#13;
was depreciated by 76% in 1981, by 42% in 1982, and by 20% in 19833&#13;
A black market persisted, but the differential between the market&#13;
rate and the rate at either of the two official windows was much&#13;
smaller than it was before the 1981 reform. Also, the black market&#13;
was  rather   small  compared  to  a few   years  ago0    In  1984  the&#13;
government unified the exchange rate.&#13;
240       Kenya too has pursued an active exchange rate policy in&#13;
recent years0 The nominal exchange rate was devalued by significant&#13;

margins in recent years, engineering a depreciation in the real rate&#13;
of 30% between 1978 and 1983.      The government budget deficit has&#13;
been brought under control. The Zambian reform initiated in 1983 is&#13;
far too new to evaluate but early signs are promising.       Experience&#13;
elsewhere is not as reassuring as in these cases.&#13;
25.       In Africa a well designed and effectively executed real&#13;
devaluation is likely to improve incentives for agricultural produc-&#13;
tion and for all exports.      It means a significant change in the&#13;
distribution of income in favour of farmers and exporters at the&#13;
expense of government workers and those engaged in production and&#13;
local trade of manufactured goods.      From both the efficiency and&#13;
equity standpoint there may be good reasons for trying to restrain&#13;
real wages in the small formal sector as well as scarcity rents and&#13;
monopolistic profits in manufacturing and trade. Frequently, earn-&#13;
ings of unskilled workers in this sector tend to be substantially&#13;
higher than their opportunity cost, thereby distorting resource&#13;
allocation and augmenting the rate of rural-urban migration.        The&#13;
level of formal wages is high because of a number of historical&#13;
circumstances: minimum wage legislation, the attempt to narrow the&#13;
differential between salaries of expatriates and indigenous workers&#13;
as well as rents accruing to urban activities as a result of protec-&#13;
tionist policies.&#13;
26.      Changing incentives and income distribution is much easier&#13;
to engineer if aggregate GDP is growing rapidly than during a period&#13;
of stagnation or absolute decline in living standards. Groups who&#13;
lose from policy changes during periods of overall buoyancy do not&#13;
generally encounter absolute reductions in welfare. Such reductions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
may be difficult to avoid9 however, when devaluation and associated&#13;
policy changes coincide with economy-wide recessions.        Under such&#13;
circumstances , the losing groups may retaliate by invoking their&#13;
collective bargaining strength;    both economic and political0    They&#13;
are more likely to retaliate9 the less they understand the justifi-&#13;
cation of the reform and the more they perceive their organized&#13;
strength to be. It follows that devaluation and related policy&#13;
reform under conditions of overall economic decline will Impose a&#13;
heavy strain on the political      leadership.    It is of the utmost&#13;
importance9 under these circumstances, to inject additional external&#13;
resources into the economy and thereby reduce the time-interval&#13;
between the introduction of the reform and the arrival of the social&#13;
dividend which all groups can share0 External resources iniected in&#13;
this manner can make less arduous the task of political leadership&#13;
and reinforce the credibility of policy reforms.&#13;
The Production Response to Devaluation&#13;
27o       Secondly9 let us take up the assertion that there will be&#13;
little production response to the realignment in prices9 follotwTing a&#13;
real depreciation   in the exchange    rate0   The realignment should&#13;
yield a relative rise in the prices of internationally traded goods&#13;
and services (exports and import substitutes) as against non-&#13;
tradeables (real estate9 trade in local goods and services, con-&#13;
struction,  utilities,   social  services9  etco).    The  response  in&#13;
Africa to higher prices and higher profitability in activities&#13;
geared to traded goods and services is not likely to be En mich as&#13;
can be expected in OECD countries where mature institutions, better&#13;
organization and a skilled labour force make for greater flexibility&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
and adaptability.   But this contrast need not be a source of unqual-&#13;
ified "elasticity pessimism" in Africa.     An analytical approach to&#13;
this issue would attempt to classify sub-sector, sector and country&#13;
situations along a spectrum which has at one end situations charac-&#13;
terized by extreme structural rigidities and at the other end&#13;
situations which hold promise of a substantial supply response to&#13;
improved  price  incentives.    In fact,   most situations will    fall&#13;
somewhere in between the two ends of the spectrum and will respond&#13;
to policy packages which combine "getting the prices right" (via&#13;
changes in the exchange rate, for example) with structural or&#13;
institutional reforms.    It is true, nevertheless, that the removal&#13;
of structural or institutional impediments takes time and the larger&#13;
their relative importance in any given economic situation, the&#13;
smaller will be the response to improved price incentives in the&#13;
short-term.   Furthermore, small realignments in incentives may not&#13;
be effective. For example, African businessmen engaged in specula-&#13;
tive and rent-seeking activities in real estate and domestic trade&#13;
may not switch to commodity production unless the increase in&#13;
incentives for the latter are perceived to be both substantial and&#13;
durable.    There may well be a threshold of stable profitability&#13;
below which the transition will not occur.       It follows that to be&#13;
successful the policy reform has to generate intra-marginal realign-&#13;
ment in incentives which are perceived by economic agents to be&#13;
irreversible.   Policy has to create strong signals for the present&#13;
and to bring about a turn-around in expectations for the future.&#13;
28.       An important source of flexibility in many of our sample&#13;
countries (and in Africa more broadly) is the fact that economies,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
today, are operating well below full capacity.    For example, recent&#13;
production and volume of exports in Uganda, Sudan, Tanzania, Zaire&#13;
and Madagascar were much less than in earlier years. Many different&#13;
factors were responsible for tnese shortfalls but two explanations&#13;
tended to cut across all of them. The first was the undermining of&#13;
producer incentives that came about as real exchange rates appreci-&#13;
ated during the 1970so     And secondly, imported production inputs&#13;
(fertilizer, pesticides, spare parts for tractors and trucks, etc.)&#13;
became increasingly difficult to obtain in recent years0         Under&#13;
these circumstances, a restructuring of incentives brought about by&#13;
the activation of exchange rate policy combined with an increase of&#13;
quick disbursing external aid to finance imported intermediate goods&#13;
can generate a sizeable pay-off in short order.        Yields of tree&#13;
crops can be increased substantially through better husbandry and&#13;
higher input use.     The area under annual crops (rainfed cotton,&#13;
tobacco, etc.) can be expanded quickly in certain circumstanceso&#13;
And the utilization of already established irrigation capacity (for&#13;
example the Geizera Scheme in the Sudan) can be raised substantially&#13;
in less than a year0&#13;
29.     Unutilized capacity is even more conspicuous in the manufac-&#13;
turing  sector   in  our  sample  countries0    Again,   low  capacity&#13;
utilization was the result of many causes but scarcity of imported&#13;
production inputs and a setback in demand for many items owing to&#13;
overall stagnation in incomes were two prominent factors0 As recov-&#13;
ery gets underway, and provided that the foreign exchange constraint&#13;
in the manufacturing sector can be relaxed (through external aid in&#13;
the first instance), it should be possible to secure a substantial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
increase in production very quickly. Exchange rate policy, in this&#13;
context, is relevant in two ways. First a realistic exchange rate&#13;
will assist greatly in securing a proper allocation of imported&#13;
intermediate goods within the manufacturing sector.      And secondly,&#13;
by raising incentives and incomes of farmers, the reformed exchange&#13;
rate will help assure markets for the additional production of manu-&#13;
factured goods.&#13;
30.     So much for potential flexibility.    On the other side of the&#13;
ledger we have to recognize that the outlook for world trade in&#13;
primary commodities which today dominate the exports of sample&#13;
countries (copper, coffee, cobalt, cotton, sugar, tobacco, tea,&#13;
hides and skins, livestock, cloves, groundnuts) is not favourable.&#13;
Lying behind this assessment are a number of structural and techno-&#13;
logical factors.   Copper continues to be displaced by other metals.&#13;
The demand for coffee and tea in OECD countries is saturated.     Subs-&#13;
titution by synthetics has affected cotton adversely.         Sugar has&#13;
been hit by protectionist policies. The health hazard has affected&#13;
the demand for tobacco.     The projected increase in the volume of&#13;
world exports in the next decade is as low as 1.3% per annum in the&#13;
case of cotton and, in no major African export commodity is growth&#13;
expected to exceed 3% per annum 11/.&#13;
31.     The implications of this global prospect is very serious. To&#13;
generate foreign exchange earnings commensurate with their import&#13;
needs, African countries have to displace other suppliers in markets&#13;
which in the aggregate are not likely to expand very much. Many of&#13;

these competing suppliers are within Africa, while others are&#13;
elsewhere.    A dynamic exchange rate policy will be an essential&#13;
prerequisite for countries wishing to exploit their comparative&#13;
advantage fully in these traditional export products. If many sample&#13;
countries engage in this battle of commodity shares simultaneously,&#13;
the world price may fall.      For example, Uganda's share in world&#13;
coffee exports was 4.5% in 19820        If it starts selling in the&#13;
non-quota coffee market, but other producers do not resort to this&#13;
policy, Uganda may be able to add to its export earnings without&#13;
affecting  the world   price.    However,   if  all African   countries&#13;
simultaneously begin to enter the non-quota market, the world price&#13;
may fall, considering that the total share of these countzies in&#13;
global exports is 27%o    This will lower returns in coffee but even&#13;
these may be attractive in several African countries relative to&#13;
what can be earned in alternative activities.         Beyond a certain&#13;
point,  of  course,   declining  world  coffee   prices  will  generate&#13;
signals for shifting resources at the margin from coffee to new&#13;
exports  or import   substitutes.    This  coffee  example  illustrates&#13;
general issues as they affect a number of traditional commodities&#13;
which now occupy a prominent position in African exports0&#13;
32.        Diversification of production and exports is almost as&#13;
important on the agenda of sample countries as the rehabilitation of&#13;
traditional export crops.    Unpublished studies by, World Bank staff&#13;
have identified a number of promising opportunities0 In Uganda, for&#13;
example, rehabilitation of coffee, cotton, tea and tobacco can yield&#13;
substantial expansion in foreign exchange earnings of traditional&#13;
exports.   These efforts need to be supplemented by the exploitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
of new opportunities in the development of livestock and horticul-&#13;
tural products as well as maize for exports. Similarly, in Malawi,&#13;
the intensification of traditional export crops (tobacco, cotton and&#13;
groundnuts) should go hand in hand with efforts to diversify into&#13;
wheat, macadamia and cashew nuts, rubber and coffee.      Zambia repre-&#13;
sents a special case in so far as the prospects for expanding the&#13;
traditional export, namely copper, are quite bleak.       Large outlays&#13;
will be required just in order to sustain existing tonnages till the&#13;
depletion of accessible, high-grade ores leads to a decline in&#13;
production.   However, studies show the possibility of diversifying&#13;
into the production of beef, coffee, tobacco and confectionary&#13;
groundnuts for exports and dairy, poultry, cassava, sorghum, maize&#13;
and sunflower for the home market.        in addition,   Zambia can be&#13;
competitive in the production of food manufactures, wood and wood&#13;
products, some textiles and some metal products. In Madagascar, the&#13;
rehabilitation of coffee, vanilla, pepper and cocoa should be&#13;
pursued alongside the development of butter beans, coconut, cashew,&#13;
cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and tropical fruits which do not figure&#13;
today as exports but which hold out promising opportunities.&#13;
33.      Circumstances exist in which the shift from traditional to&#13;
new activities   can occur fairly quickly.      For example,   improved&#13;
incentives for cereals can generate substantial increases in local&#13;
food output and thereby save foreign exchange.       There is scope in&#13;
several countries for bringing new areas under rain-fed cultivation&#13;
(Zambia, for example) or for increasing yields per hactare by simple&#13;
improvements in husbandry (Malawi, for example).     Such easy shifts,&#13;
however, will not be feasible, if organizational, institutional or&#13;

Free Markets and Government Controls&#13;
35.     Thirdly, let us examine the nerits and demerits of a market-&#13;
clearing exchange rate on the one hand and administrative controls&#13;
on the allocation of foreign exchange on the other hand.       A regime&#13;
in which there is no government intervention in the foreign exchange&#13;
market hardly exists anywhere.      The post Bretton Woods period of&#13;
floating exchange rates of major currencies has not meant the&#13;
absence of government intervention, although variations in rates&#13;
have contributed much more to balance of payment adjustments than&#13;
during  the pre-1973 system of adjustable pegs.        Experience with&#13;
floating has raised other problems however; the extreme volatility&#13;
of rates and their tendency to "overshoot" has become a matter of&#13;
concern.14/ As far as African currencies in our sample are concern-&#13;
ed, none can be said to be floating in     the same sense as the major&#13;
OECD currencies, and exchange controls remain on most capital and on&#13;
many current account transactions. The issue in this context is not&#13;
the free market versus controls in extreme form but rather the&#13;
manner in which price and non-price instruments of policy can be&#13;
combined into an effective exchange-cum-trade regime.        Demand for&#13;
total imports is a function of the level of economic activity, of&#13;
monetary and fiscal policy as well as of the price and availability&#13;
of foreign exchange. Capacity to import, in turn, depends on export&#13;

earnings, availability of ODA, resort to commercial borrowing and&#13;
scheduled debt service payments.    Clearly, the rate of exchange has&#13;
an important role to play on both the demand and supply side but it&#13;
is by no means an overriding role.&#13;
36,     The supply of foreign exchange for imports in several sample&#13;
countries in recent years has fallen far short of demand at the&#13;
current official exchange rate.    The problem has been most acute in&#13;
Uganda before 1981, Sudan, Somalia, Zambia and Tanzania. Governments&#13;
have attempted to ration foreign exchange in response to national&#13;
priorities015/    It has not been easy, however, to define well-&#13;
specified  allocation   criteria or to collect    timely and reliable&#13;
information with which to administer these criteria0 Predicting the&#13;
magnitude of foreign exchange availability has also been a major&#13;
problem0    Scarcity  of qualified   professional   and  administrative&#13;
staffs to manage the rationing process has added to the difficul-&#13;
ties0 Users of foreign exchange have had to do much paper work and&#13;
to suffer uncertainty and delayo They have retaliated by manlpulat-&#13;
ing the system through over- and under-invoicing of goods, bribes or&#13;
by going to the black market0       Foreign exchange has commanded a&#13;
large premium in the black market as well as in the normal market&#13;
for import-intensive goods0 Powerful incentives have been generated&#13;
for cornering as much imports as possible through the control system&#13;
and by illegal means.      Much more energy was devoted by economic&#13;
agents to the securing of import licenses or to playing the black&#13;

market  than to improving productivity and      competitiveness.    The&#13;
incidence of these problems has fluctuated over time and they are&#13;
not equally serious,    of course,  in all sample countries.      It is&#13;
quite likely, however, that attempts to manage foreign exchange&#13;
administratively have imposed heavy costs in terms of distortions in&#13;
resource allocation and unequal access by various socio-economic&#13;
groups.&#13;
37.        The scepticism of some African policy-makers       regarding&#13;
market allocation of foreign exchange for imports has to be re-&#13;
evaluated in the light of recent experience with rationing. Undoubt-&#13;
edly, the market solution will also fall short of the optimal in&#13;
significant ways. Monopolistic elements, the inequality in income&#13;
and asset distribution, the failure to give due weight to long-run&#13;
considerations and the presence of externalities will cause the&#13;
market allocation of foreign exchange to diverge from the socially&#13;
desirable solution. All these market failures are good reasons for&#13;
government intervention as long as the social benefits of such&#13;
intervention exceed the costs.     Recent experience in sample coun-&#13;
tries demonstrates that the costs of government intervention in the&#13;
foreign exchange market can become prohibitive.16!       Where this is&#13;
the case, a strong case can be made for relieving the pressure on&#13;
the control system by leaning more heavily on the exchange rate as&#13;
an allocator of foreign exchange.&#13;

IV. Role of Exchange Rate in an Adjustment Package&#13;
380      Williamson 17/ discusses three definitions of exchange rate&#13;
equilibrium:     market   equilibriums   fundamental   equilibrium  and&#13;
current equilibrium.     Although this   treatment is largely in the&#13;
context of rich, industrial countries and requires a great deal of&#13;
adaptation to make it relevant for our African sample, it is,&#13;
nonetheless, suggestive.     The old concept of fundamental disequi-&#13;
librium, which was the criterion for changing exchange rate parity&#13;
under the Bretton Woods system, remains the most useful point of&#13;
departure for our discussion.       Fundamental disequilibrium of an&#13;
exchange rate is signalled by the following,&#13;
(i) deficit on the current account of the balance of payments&#13;
which cannot be financed by the "autonomous" inflow of&#13;
external capital;&#13;
(ii)  high level of unemployment;&#13;
(iii)  the imposition of quantitative restrictions on imports for&#13;
payment purposes.&#13;
We have already discussed (iii) above; (i) and (ii) require special&#13;
interpretation in the context of economic conditions in our sampleo&#13;
39.     First, current deficits in our nine countries are typically&#13;
financed to a large extent by ofÂ£fcial development assistance (i.eo&#13;
grants and concessional loans) rather than by autonomou$ capital&#13;
(i.e., private direct investment and loans on commercial terms)O&#13;
The average share of ODA amounts in total external resource inflow&#13;
in a  sample   of  16 African   countries  was  82%   during  the  late&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
1970s.18/ The availability of ODA varies widely among countries and&#13;
over time in any single recipient. The average ratio of ODA/GDP&#13;
in our sample rose from 3.6% in 1970/72 to 4.8% in 1974/76 to 7.6%&#13;
in 1978/80. There were large variations around these averages. For&#13;
example, 1980 saw a ratio of 1% in one case, 5-8% in four cases,&#13;
10-14% in another three and one country had a ratio of more than&#13;
20%. How then should we interpret fundamental disequilibrium in the&#13;
exchange rate? It is only reasonable to assume that substantial ODA&#13;
will continue to flow to most Sub-Saharan African countries in the&#13;
foreseeable future. It is also probably true that ODA to GDP ratios&#13;
in many cases were extraordinary in recent years and cannot be sus-&#13;
tained at these levels. The value of ODA (in current prices) to all&#13;
Sub-Saharan countries rose by 32% in 1978, 23% in 1979 and 19% in&#13;
1980.  The next year 1981 saw a slight absolute decline.       Both be-&#13;
cause present ODA ratios are likely to be unsustainable and because&#13;
it ought to be the aim of economic management to move systematically&#13;
towards self reliance, Mrican governments should set their poli-&#13;
cies, including the exchange rate, so that the ratio of ODA to GDP&#13;
is reduced gradually over time.      There can be exceptions to this&#13;
rule but the broad generalization stands. Admittedly, the generali-&#13;
zation has normative elements embedded in it.      It will be possible&#13;
to raise the role of commercial borrowing from abroad as an offset&#13;
to ODA but existing constraints on creditworthiness will severely&#13;
limit the extent to which this would be feasible or desirable.&#13;

40.     The second criteria for judging the adequacy of the exchange&#13;
rate is unemployment0 In the context of largely agricultural econo-&#13;
mies with relatively small organized wage sectors, as in our sample,&#13;
the concern with unemployment is somewhat misplaced. But the basic&#13;
point underlying the concern is very lmportant. The current account&#13;
deficit can be reduced drastically and swiftly through very restric-&#13;
tive monetary and fiscal policies.    External balance can be secured&#13;
at the expense of growth and investment but such an outcome is not&#13;
"fundamental equilibrium".    Economic management has to aim at a&#13;
judicious combination of controlling aggregate demand as well as&#13;
eliciting a supply responseO     But how much real economic growth&#13;
should be aimed at? Our sample countries are at a very early stage&#13;
of economic development and foregoing growth opportunities for them&#13;
imply high welfare costso They are also undergoing rapid demograph-&#13;
ic expansion019/    Under these circumstances, African governments&#13;
ought to adopt policies, including the exchange rate, aimed at&#13;
maintaining a minimum real GDP growth of about 3.0O3.5% per annumo&#13;
Such a pace of expansion will help to maintain the level of per&#13;
capita consumption and to sustain a modicum of investment.      Again,&#13;
we can visualize exceptions but the general rule stands0&#13;
41.       The implications of 0declining ODA/GDP and current account&#13;
deficit/GDP ratios as well as the need to maintain a minimum real&#13;
GDP growth of 3.0O3.5% per annum are that exports miost increase&#13;
rapidly and that local production should replace imports as rapidly&#13;

as  efficiency   considerations  allow.     The  precise,  quantitative&#13;
requirements for exports and imports will, of course, vary but on&#13;
balance for sample countries it will be necessary to expand export-&#13;
based import capacity by at least 5 to 6% per annum.&#13;
42.       In our view, exchange rate policy should be considered in&#13;
this recovery and growth context and not simply from the stand-point&#13;
of short-term stabilization.    The importance of the exchange rate is&#13;
that it can influence the structure of incentives in the economy&#13;
and help to encourage the flow of resources (capital, skilled labor,&#13;
managerial know-how, foreign exchange) into the export and import&#13;
substitution sectors.    The more acute the scarcity of foreign ex-&#13;
change, the stronger should be the stimulus to profitability of&#13;
these  tradeable activities.     The magnitude of the exchange     rate&#13;
adjustment required to promote exports and import substitution at&#13;
the desired pace is not easy to estimate and policy-makers will have&#13;
to reach their aim through trial and error.&#13;
43.       The usual practice has been to approach the exchange rate&#13;
question in the framework of the Purchasing Power Parity Theory;20/&#13;
i.e, to realign domestic prices with those prevailing in the&#13;
country's trading partners through changes in the exchange rate.&#13;
This simple proposition has been a useful guidepost to policy in&#13;
countries (including many in our sample) with egregious distortions&#13;
in exchange   rates.    We  agree with Nashashibi,    however,   that  a&#13;
"supply" framework   for exchange   rate determination  would be   much&#13;

more useful in Africa021/ The focus of this approach is on analyz-&#13;
ing the domestic resource cost of earning or saving foreign exchange&#13;
through traditional and new exports as well as different import&#13;
substitution activities.    On this basis, traded goods and services&#13;
can be ranked according to their existing and potential competitive-&#13;
ness022/ Activities in which the country enjoys the most compara-&#13;
tive advantage (presumably, the traditional exports) would be ranked&#13;
the highest and these would be profitable even if foreign exchange&#13;
was priced at a relatively low level in terms of domestic currency0&#13;
As the price of foreign exchange is raised, additional activities&#13;
(new exports and import substitutes) would become profitable0       The&#13;
adjusted exchange rate should be set, in principle, at a level that&#13;
produces the required expansion in exports and/or displacement of&#13;
imports as discussed above in paragraph 41. In practice, difficul-&#13;
ties of assessing the magnitude of the supply response would rule&#13;
out any fine-tuning and make necessary a step-by-step approach&#13;
involving monitoring and evaluation of an initial exchange rate&#13;
adjustment followed by the design of the next move0&#13;
44.      Moving towards an equilibrium exchange rate is a necessary&#13;
but not a sufficient condition for stabilization and structural&#13;
adjustment. Exchange rate action has to be part of a larger policy-&#13;
package, each element of which reinforces the rest0      It is not our&#13;
intention to elaborate on these policies which support exchange rate&#13;

action and vice-versa, but we will briefly mention some of the link-&#13;
ages.   These supportive policies may be grouped according to their&#13;
purpose, as follows:&#13;
-    Policies which aim at transmitting the impact of the new&#13;
exchange rate to controlled prices, taxes and other elements&#13;
in the economy-wide incentive system. For example, devalua-&#13;
tion which is unaccompanied by a corresponding increase in&#13;
agricultural producer prices of export and import substitute&#13;
crops will not yield the expected results. The same applies&#13;
to government regulated sales prices of imported petroleum,&#13;
grain or fertilizer.&#13;
-    Policies which aim at rationalization of the trade regime on&#13;
the occasion of an exchange rate change or soon thereafter.&#13;
For example, governments may wish to reduce tariff rates&#13;
and/or export subsidies or to replace quantitative restric-&#13;
tions on imports by tariffs.&#13;
-    Policies (monetary, fiscal, wage) which aim at restraining&#13;
inflation and securing a devaluation in the real exchange&#13;
rate (see paras. 18-22).&#13;
-    Injection   of  external  assistance  and  the grant   of  debt&#13;
relief aimed at expanding imported inputs required for the&#13;
production of traded goods made more profitable by a devalu-&#13;
ation of the exchange rate. (See paras. 28, 29).&#13;
-    Organizational and institutional     reform aimed at removing&#13;
impediments to the production of exports and import substi-&#13;
tutes made more profitable by the new exchange rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

V. Conclusion&#13;
45.     Governments in sample countries in Africa did not look upon&#13;
the exchange rate as a major instrument of economic management till&#13;
recently.  During the Bretton Woods period 1965-1973, real exchange&#13;
rates appreciated significantly in five of the nine sample coun-&#13;
trieso Governments of these countries took a long time to acjust to&#13;
the situation created by escalating global inflation and the float-&#13;
ing exchange rate regime for major currencies in the pericd after&#13;
1973. Even today there persist three types of scepticism about the&#13;
effectiveness of pursuing an active exchange rate policy in Africa0&#13;
46.        First nominal devaluations can accentuate inflation and&#13;
thereby prevent real exchange rate changes from occuring.         This&#13;
outcome is not inevitable however, and much depends on the design of&#13;
the policy package of which a change in the exchange rate is a&#13;
part0   Secondly African economies are not flexible and changes in&#13;
real exchange rates may not produce much production responseo      Al-&#13;
though structural rigidities are present, there are no grounds for&#13;
unqualified elasticity pessimism0 Many African economies today are&#13;
operating well below capacity which can be used more fully through a&#13;
policy package combining restructuring of incentives and quick&#13;
disbursing external aido    What is required in sample countries is&#13;
not only rehabilitation and fuller exploitation of existing capacity&#13;
in traditional export crops but also diversification in the struc-&#13;
ture of productiono World demand for African traditional exports is&#13;
likely to be quite weak and this will necessitate shifting resources&#13;
at the margin into new primary and manufactured exports aS well as&#13;
import substitutes0   A dynamic exchange rate policy is an cssential&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
pre-requisite for African countries to recover their historical&#13;
share of traditional exports and for launching the diversification&#13;
drive.   It can influence the structure of incentives in the economy&#13;
and redirect   resources  into tradeable sectors.      Thirdly,  market&#13;
determined exchange rates allocate foreign exchange in less than a&#13;
socially optimal manner on account of many kinds of imperfections.&#13;
Attempts to ration foreign exchange administratively in several&#13;
sample countries have imposed prohibitive costs however and the case&#13;
for relieving the pressure on the control system has become persua-&#13;
sive.&#13;
47.       The magnitude of the adjustment required in the exchange&#13;
rate is not easy to calculate in any precise way.         It is clear,&#13;
nevertheless, that the exchange rate should reflect the scarcity&#13;
value of foreign exchange. This premium on foreign exchange will be&#13;
the greater,&#13;
-    the higher the GDP growth rate required to maintain per&#13;
capita consumption and a modicum of investment;&#13;
-    the smaller the prospect of sustaining the current ratios of&#13;
ODA/GDP;&#13;
-    the less favourable the prospect for the international terms&#13;
of trade for the economy;&#13;
-    the higher the present debt service ratio and the level of&#13;
accumulated arrears.&#13;
48.        Given the acute financial and economic crisis       in many&#13;
African countries and not very positive prospects for growth of&#13;
demand or increase in prices of their traditional exports, it is&#13;
important that governments use exchange rates very actively to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
expand exports and save on imports.      The right aim may well be to&#13;
bring about gradually a substantial real depreciation in the ex-&#13;
change rate in several instances.&#13;

Appendix 2&#13;
The Spread of Quantitative Restrictions on Imports in Eastern Africa&#13;
1.          We have conducted a historical review of the incidence and&#13;
severity of quantitative restrictions (QRs) on imports in nine&#13;
countries.    The period covered    is 1967-82 and the main source of&#13;
information is the IMF's Annual Report on Exchange Restrictions. The&#13;
main results are summarized in Table 1 and underscore the strong trend&#13;
towards the spread of import restrictions, particularly since 1975.&#13;
While no country maintained payment restrictions on imports in 1967,&#13;
all except Malawi and Somalia'/ resorted to such practices in 1982.&#13;
Increasing scarcity of foreign exchange and distrust of macro fiscal&#13;
and monetary policy instruments led most sample countries to super-&#13;
impose controls on payments on top of tariffs add QRs.&#13;
The Mid-Sixties Regime&#13;
2.          By and large the trade regime characteristic of the mid-&#13;
sixties can be described as a "liberal" one.      Ethiopia had virtually&#13;
no import restrictions.     A number of trade groupings and currency&#13;
areas permitted   free  trade to a varying degree.       Madagascar,   for&#13;
example, belonged to the franc zone and Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda,&#13;
Kenya and Zambia to the sterling area.&#13;
1/ Some restrictions are present in Somalia if a letter of credit is&#13;
used in payment.&#13;

3.          Despite its mmbership in GATT, Japan was singled out for&#13;
discrimination. Malawi and Kenya maintained restrictions on imports&#13;
from Japan while Tanzania stipulated their prohibition unless it could&#13;
be established that specific Japanese goods were of special value to&#13;
the Tanzanian development program.&#13;
4.        Commodity specific import restrictions were much more common&#13;
in the mid-sixties than restrictions based on country of origin.&#13;
Precise information was not available on the scope and intensity of&#13;
such restrictions. It was not possible, therefore, to make conclusive&#13;
assessments on a comparative basis regarding the extent of the depar-&#13;
ture from free trade in individual countries.     It was also clear that&#13;
import restrictions were prompted by a variety of considerations. The&#13;
following illustrations should serve to convey the nature of such&#13;
restrictions:&#13;
-    Restrictions aimed at providing infant industry protection,&#13;
generally processed foods, textile and clothing, shoes,&#13;
etc. In Kenya, Tanzania, Sudan and Zambia such restrictions&#13;
sometimes took the form of complete prohibitions.&#13;
-    Restrictions aimed at channelling imports through parastat-&#13;
als as in Uganda for rice and ghee, in the Sudan for sugar&#13;
and in Madagascar for alcoholic beverages, rice, wheat&#13;
flour, vegetable oil and cement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
Restrictions   aimed  at  safeguarding   health  or   security.&#13;
Examples are explosives and arms in Malawi0&#13;
Restrictions aimed at limiting the imports of luxury goods.&#13;
An example is the prohibition on the importation of&#13;
automobiles for private use in Tanzania since 19740&#13;
-    Madagascar made certain imports conditional on the purchase&#13;
by the exporting country of comparable domestic products or&#13;
similar products produced in fraternal countries such as&#13;
Senegal.&#13;
The 1982 Regime&#13;
5.          By 1982D  the trade and payment regime in our sample coun-&#13;
tries had moved very far away from the largely "liberal" model that&#13;
existed in the immediate post-independence period0      The East African&#13;
Common Market   collapsed in 19770     Madagascar   left the franc zone&#13;
around 19800 The sterling area ceased to be a cohesive trade or mone-&#13;
tary grouping0   In addition, there was a proliferation of commodity-&#13;
specific import restrictions in response to (i) pressures from local&#13;
producers; (ii) the trend towards the establishment of state agencies&#13;
to engage in imports, and; (iii) the rapid deterioration in the&#13;
balance of payments position following the oil price increase in 1973&#13;
and once again in 19790&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
6.          All imports were restricted by licensing in only Tanzania&#13;
and Zambia in 1967.     By contrast, five other countries (Madagascar,&#13;
Somalia, Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia) are listed under this heading in&#13;
1982 (Table 1)    Tanzania does not appear in this category in 1982&#13;
because a few items are exempted from licensing under the Import&#13;
Control Notice of April 1980.     Zambia is also not listed under this&#13;
category in 1982 because the requirements of the mining companies, the&#13;
Health Ministry and certain other narrowly defined items do not&#13;
require an import licence.      In Uganda, all imports are subject to&#13;
licensing except imports costing less than $2,000.        Notwithstanding&#13;
these exceptions, we can conclude that import restrictions were&#13;
virtually all pervasive in Tanzania, Zambia and Uganda as well as the&#13;
five countries mentioned in Table 1.     Malawi was the only country in&#13;
our sample where non-restrictive open general licensing existed to a&#13;
substantial extent in 1982.&#13;
7.           It was not easy to assess the relative strength of the&#13;
forces that have brought about the massive administrative control&#13;
system  that  typically   pertains  to  imports   today.    Protectionist&#13;
impulses undoubtedly account for a great many of the import restric-&#13;
tions in the field of consumer manufactures.     The drive for industri-&#13;
alization in the late 1960s and early 1970s was reflected in tax&#13;
concessions, tariff increases on competing imports as well as the&#13;
imposition  of QRs   in many countries.      It was argued   that tariff&#13;
protection was not sufficiently powerful to provide the required&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
incentives for local producers since they could be offset by promo-&#13;
tional pricing policies of foreign competitors and since local&#13;
consumers exhibited an "irrational" preference for foreign goods.&#13;
6.            Combined with protectionist pressures was the growing&#13;
tendency for governments to channel import priveleges to parastatals&#13;
at the expense of private partieso       For example the Soeali State&#13;
Trading Organization was given excluaive rights to import animal or&#13;
vegetable oils and fats, corn, rice1, wheat flour, coffee, tea, sugarD&#13;
paste, cement, soap, detergent, rubber or plastic footwear and cotton&#13;
cloth0    Somali Petroleum was the cole importer of fuel products,&#13;
bstteries and tireso    The Somali Pharmaceutical Agency was the sole&#13;
i2porter of medicineso    The Somali Construction Agency t,'as the sole&#13;
importer of construction materials.    Later on Somali parestatals were&#13;
made responsible for most imports other than those for which foreign&#13;
exchange was obtained privately via the Franco-valuta system, and&#13;
migrant's earnings0   This policy of canalizing imports to parastatals&#13;
was also pursued to varying degrees in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and&#13;
Zambia.&#13;
90          The protectionist and etatist forces ran their course but&#13;
the dominating factor in the current import policy regime was the&#13;
acute and widespread foreign exchange crisis that persistaS    According&#13;
to Table 1, seven countries imposed payment restrictIons in 1982,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
compared to 6 in 1979, 5 in 1975, 2 in 1971 and 0 in 1967. The manner&#13;
in which exchange control is exercised varies widely in our sample&#13;
countries; some details are presented in the matrix included in the&#13;
annex.   The attempt is made to assess      the likely availability    of&#13;
foreign exchange within a specified period and to assign priorities&#13;
for various   claimants  including   foreign  creditors.    The  task  is&#13;
complicated by the fact that different conditions apply to the use of&#13;
foreign aid and external loans from bilateral, multilateral and&#13;
private sources. As financial cost applicable to these resources also&#13;
varies greatly, the problem of management requires yet another dimen-&#13;
sion.    The need for data,    expertise and organization    required   to&#13;
formulate, administer, monitor and evaluate the foreign exchange&#13;
budget under these circumstances is a very heavy burden for most coun-&#13;
tries, let alone those in Africa struggling to establish effective&#13;
government machinery.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Exchange rate policies of nine countries
            in Africa during the post-independence period are examined.
            Governments in these countries did not look upon the
            exchange rate as a major policy instrument and the paper
            reviews the impact of this neglect on worsening economic
            growth and the balance of payments towards the end of the
            1970s and the early 1980s. Even today many African
            governments believe that devaluation will accentuate
            inflation, exacerbate budget deficits and yield few benefits
            in terms of increased exports or lower imports. It is argued
            that such general skepticism is misplaced and that the
            effectiveness of exchange rate policy depends on how well it
            is designed and implemented. The paper concludes by pointing
            out that the pursuit of a dynamic exchange rate policy is an
            essential component in a policy package aimed at structural adjustment.
