The increase in the number of Contracting States          compared to only nine that have ended in final&#13;

 accessions to ICSID membership may be even              well as an expansion in the informational and ad-&#13;
more significant. New Contracting States include         visory services offered by the Centre. Research&#13;

&#13;
ICSID 's Secretary-General. In doing so I recall the&#13;
aspirations that I had for ICSID at the outset of my&#13;
first term in office. One was for ICSID to assume&#13;
a more important role in improving the investment&#13;
climate at large, and in developing countries in&#13;
particular. I emphasized, however, in my first&#13;
Annual Report, thatiCSID couldplaythatrole only&#13;
to the extent that its potential clients, investors and&#13;
host countries, would consent to resort to ICSID 's&#13;
dispute settlement facilities. Over the past decade,&#13;
such consents have proliferated as ICSID clauses&#13;
have been included not only in individual invest-&#13;
ment contracts but also in laws and treaties cov-&#13;
ering most investment flows among large&#13;
numbers of countries. This and the continuing&#13;
expansion of ICSID's membership attest&#13;
to the important position that the Centre has&#13;
come to occupy in the promotion of international&#13;
investment.&#13;

     The Financial Statements of ICSID for the fis-&#13;
cal year 1993 are set forth in Annex 3.&#13;
     The administrative expenditures of ICSID&#13;
were, again, entirely covered by the World Bank&#13;
pursuant to the Memorandum of Administrative&#13;
Arrangements concluded between the World&#13;
BankandiCSIDinFebruary 1967, and by income&#13;
from the sale of publications.&#13;
     It was, therefore, not necessary to assess any&#13;
excess expenditures on Contracting States pur-&#13;
suant to Article l 7 of the Convention.&#13;
     ICSID expenditures relating to pending arbi-&#13;
tration proceedings are borne by the parties in&#13;
accordance with ICSID's Administrative and&#13;
Financial Regulations.&#13;

3 Until Mauritius attained its independence on March 12, 1968, it was covered by the ratification of the United&#13;
  Kingdom.&#13;
4 On depositing its instrument of ratification, the Netherlands restricted the application of the Convention to the&#13;
&#13;
  Kingdom in Europe; by a notification received on May 22, 1970, the Netherlands withdrew that restriction and thus&#13;
  extended the application of the Convention to Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles; Suriname having attained in-&#13;
  dependence on November 25, 1975, the Convention ceased to be applicable to Suriname as of that date.&#13;
s On depositing its instrument of ratification, New Zealand, pursuant to Article 70 of the Convention, excluded from&#13;
  its coverage the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau.&#13;

     The Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements between the Centre and the International Bank&#13;
for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) which became effective as of October 14, 1966, pro-&#13;
vides, that, except to the extent that the Centre may be reimbursed by the parties to proceedings for&#13;
fees and expenses of members of Conciliation Commissions, Arbitral Tribunals or ad hoc Committees,&#13;
the Bank shall provide the following services and facilities to the Centre:&#13;
&#13;
     ( 1) the services of staff members and consultants; and&#13;
     (2) other administrative services and facilities, such as travel, communications, office accommo-&#13;
          dations, furniture, equipment, supplies and printing.&#13;
&#13;
    The Centre does not have resources of its own. The reported expenditures on behalf of the Centre&#13;
represent the value of services provided by the Bank and include only those amounts identified by the&#13;
Bank as being directly related to the Centre; accordingly, reported expenditures do not include any&#13;
indirect or overhead costs of the Bank. The reported contributions of$670,898 and $618, 131 for the years&#13;
ended June 30, 1993 and June 30, 1992, respectively, are equal to the value of services provided by the&#13;
Bank, less reimbursements by the Centre from its sale of publications and registration fees. The expen-&#13;
ditures made on behalf of the Centre by the Bank are shown below:&#13;

     The Centre's expenses which are attributable to arbitration proceedings are borne by the parties&#13;
in accordance with the Centre's Administrative and Financial Regulations. In accordance with these&#13;
Regulations, the Secretary-General calls on the parties to make advance deposits with the Centre from&#13;
time to time to defray these expenses. The cash and investment balances included in the statement of&#13;
composition of fund balance represent advances from parties to arbitration proceedings, amounts due&#13;
to the Bank and investment income earned.&#13;

To International Centre for Settlement&#13;
  of Investment Disputes&#13;
&#13;
In our opinion, the accompanying statement of changes in fund balance and the related state-&#13;
ment of composition of fund balance present fairly, in all material respects, the changes in fund&#13;
balance of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for the years ended&#13;
June 30, 1993 and June 30, 1992, and the composition of fund balance at June 30, 1993 and 1992,&#13;
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and with&#13;
International Accounting Standards, and in accordance with the Administrative Arrangements&#13;
between the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International&#13;
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. These financial statements are the responsi-&#13;
bility of the Bank and the Centre's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion&#13;
on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these state-&#13;
ments in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, including International Au-&#13;
diting Guidelines, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable&#13;
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit&#13;
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the&#13;
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made&#13;
by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that&#13;
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.&#13;

            International Center for Settlement of
            Investment Disputes (ICSID) 1993 annual report
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            With the ratification of the ICSID
            convention by ten more countries, the center&#146;s membership
            grew to 109 during fiscal 1993. A further three countries
            signed the convention during the year, bringing the total
            number of signatories to 123. The increase in the number of
            contracting states during the past year surpassed that of
            any single year since the convention came into force 26
            years ago. However, looking beyond the mere numbers, the
            geographical diversity in the recent accessions to ICSID
            membership may be even more significant. New contracting
            states include China as well as Eastern European and Central
            Asian countries. Also joining in the past year was one
            further Latin American country, thereby continuing a trend
            that began only ten years ago when the convention was
            ratified by the first country from that part of the world.
            This year's Annual Report offers me an opportunity to
            look back on ten years of service as ICSID&#146;s
            Secretary-General. One was for ICSID to assume a more
            important role in improving the investment climate at large,
            and in developing countries in particular. Over the past
            decade, such consents have proliferated as ICSID clauses
            have been included not only in individual investment
            contracts but also in laws and treaties covering most
            investment flows among large numbers of countries. This and
            the continuing expansion of ICSID's membership attest
            to the important position that the center has come to occupy
            in the promotion of international investment.
