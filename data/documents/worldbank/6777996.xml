            Collateral can increase access to
            finance, especially for small firms, and lead to better
            terms for loan contracts. Many argue that firms are excluded
            from formal credit markets because they lack assets that can
            serve as collateral. In fact, firms generally have a wide
            array of productive assets that could secure a loan-but the
            legal framework prevents this. Reforming collateral laws can
            unlock dead capital, as seen in Albania and Romania.
