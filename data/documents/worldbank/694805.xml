1. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS&#13;
Energy Sector Overview&#13;
1.1   Indonesia is richly endowed with diverse and large energy resources including oil, natural gas,&#13;
coal, hydropower and geothermal. The oil and gas sectors continue to play a critical role in the&#13;
Indonesian economy, together accounting for over 85 percent of commercial net energy consumption and&#13;
for about 20 percent of the country's export receipts.&#13;
1.2   Indonesia's basic goals and policies for the future development of the energy sector are described&#13;
in the Outlines of State Policy (GBHN), promulgated by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) in&#13;
March 1993 to guide the formulation of the Sixth Medium-Term (five-year 1994/95-1998/99)&#13;
Development Plan (REPELITA VI); and the Second Stage Long-Term (twenty-five year) Development&#13;
Strategy (PJPT-II). The GBHN highlights the importance for Indonesia's sustained economic and social&#13;
development of meeting its rapidly growing energy needs efficiently -- including through conservation&#13;
and diversification of primary energy resources and their more efficient utilization -- and of minimizing&#13;
the adverse environmental and social impacts of energy use.&#13;
1.3   In the power sub-sector, the GBHN recognizes that an adequate, reliable and reasonably priced&#13;
electricity supply is essential for the country's continuing development, emphasizing its essential role in&#13;
serving the needs of the productive sectors and in contributing directly to improving the living standards&#13;
of the people in all regions of the country. Rural electrification (RE) is a key and integral part of the&#13;
Government's rural development strategy and the long-term goal is to electrify all villages and enable the&#13;
basic services provided by the modern energy form, electricity.&#13;
1.4   The Government of Indonesia (GOI) has also relied on the following policies in support of its&#13;
objectives for the energy sector:&#13;
(a) diversification: The Government's energy policy has long emphasized diversifying domestic&#13;
energy consumption away from oil towards alternative and more economic and indigenous&#13;
energy resources that either have a non-exportable surplus, such as coal and natural gas, or&#13;
are renewable and non-tradable (hydro, geothermal). Significant progress has been made in&#13;
the power sector, which is a major user of petroleum fuels, and plans call for a further&#13;
reduction of oil's share in power generation from about 15 percent in 1995/96, to about 5&#13;
percent by the end of this decade. Commitments have been recently concluded for numerous&#13;
and large geothermal power plants.&#13;
(b) energy pricing: On the demand side, the Government's policy has been to maintain average&#13;
petroleum product prices at or above international parity (efficiency pricing), while cross-&#13;
subsidizing the price of kerosene in order to ensure its affordability, with an implicit tax on&#13;
gasoline. Likewise with electricity, while periodic adjustments have generally maintained the&#13;
average retail price close to the long-run marginal cost of supply in Java, electricity prices&#13;
have been maintained below economic cost for small residential and industrial users who&#13;
account for about 40 percent of sales. The Government has also maintained a uniform price&#13;
structure for electricity and petroleum products in all parts of the country.&#13;
(c) private sector participation: The private sector operates significant amounts of captive&#13;
power capacity, and is expected to play an increasingly important role in the supply of oil,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
gas and electricity. In oil and gas, Pertamina forms joint ventures with private Production&#13;
Sharing Contractors (PSCs) for exploration and production.&#13;
Private sector participation is also being welcomed in the emerging gas transmission grid. In&#13;
power, 55% (11,600 MW) of the additional grid capacity planned for Indonesia between&#13;
1994/95 and 2003/04 (excluding captive power) is projected to come from independent&#13;
power producers (IPPs). To date, over 2,500 MW of IPP capacity is under construction and&#13;
expected to come on line by 1999-2000. In aggregate as of November 1996, Power Purchase&#13;
Agreements (PPAs) have been signed with IPPs for about 7,500 MW of capacity, of which&#13;
some 2,200 MW will be generated by geothermal, 800 MW by gas and about 4,500 MW by&#13;
coal. The Government is also considering private participation in the recently created&#13;
generating company subsidiaries of PLN, the national power utility.&#13;
The recently introduced small power purchase agreement (a tariff and offer to purchase on&#13;
the basis of a simple standard contract) is designed to encourage development of small scale&#13;
private generation plants&#13;
(d) regionally balanced development: The GOI maintains a uniform price for electricity and&#13;
petroleum products in all parts of the country; and has plans to extend the supply of&#13;
electricity in a balanced manner to all parts of the country. This policy entails the&#13;
subsidization of higher cost energy supply to outside Java and to the rural population.&#13;
(e) environmental protection: The GOI's environmental policies include support of greenhouse&#13;
gas reduction, and development of renewable energy resources. The Basic Environment&#13;
Law of 1982 provides the overall framework. The Government has established and utilizes&#13;
uniform procedures and guidelines for the preparation, and approval of environmental&#13;
impact analysis (AMDAL), for issuance of environmental clearances, as well as periodic&#13;
reporting requirements on environmental management and monitoring during project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Sector Institutions&#13;
1.5    The principal agency responsible for implementing Government policies in the energy sector is&#13;
the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME); which coordinates all activities in the energy sector and&#13;
supervises the state enterprises in the sector: PERTAMINA (oil, gas and geothermal), P.T. Bukit Asam&#13;
(coal), PGN (gas distribution) and PLN (electricity). Other ministries and agencies are also involved in&#13;
the sector, for example, the Ministry of Public Works is responsible for hydropower resource surveys&#13;
and the operation of multipurpose hydro plants, the National Atomic Energy commission is responsible&#13;
for nuclear development, and the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small Enterprises Development (MOC)&#13;
is responsible for enhancing the role of cooperatives in rural electrification. An inter-ministerial National&#13;
Energy Board (BAKOREN) coordinates energy policies and development with those of other sectors.&#13;
BAKOREN is supported by a Technical Committee (PTE) consisting of senior officials in different&#13;
departments, chaired by the Director General of Electricity and Energy Development (DGEED). The&#13;
electricity subsector is regulated by the MME through the DGEED. The organization chart of MME is&#13;
shown in Annex 1.1. Environmental policy development is led by the State Coordinating Minister for&#13;
Environment and implementation is led by the national (BAPEDAL) and newly enabled regional&#13;
(BAPEDALDA) Environmental Impact Management Agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
Electricity Subsector&#13;
1.6    The Electricity Act (Law No. 15 of 1985) defines the legal framework for electricity sector.&#13;
Under this Act, PLN, the State Electricity Corporation that was established by Government Regulation&#13;
No. 18/1972, has both the right and obligation to supply power in Indonesia. The provisions of the&#13;
Electricity Act are amplified in Government Regulation No. 17/1990 for PLN, the State Electricity&#13;
Corporation; and No. 10/1989 for others. The Electricity Act permits establishment of private power&#13;
producers, distributors and licensees. Presidential Decree No. 37/1992 specifically authorizes private&#13;
sector participation under BOO schemes, and permits cooperatives and other legal entities to generate,&#13;
transmit, and distribute power for public use.&#13;
1.7    The power sector has expanded rapidly during the 1980s and 1990s. Electricity sales of PLN&#13;
grew at an average annual rate in excess of 14% between 1981/82 and 1995/96. During the same period,&#13;
the number of customers grew nearly six-fold, from 3.2 million to about 21.5 million. In order to meet&#13;
this growth, PLN's installed capacity increased nearly five-fold from about 3,000 MW in 1981/82 to over&#13;
15,000 MW in 1995. Over the same period, PLN's implementation capacity has grown significantly,&#13;
whereby it is now connecting close to 2 million new customers a year, a pace unmatched by a single&#13;
utility, and PLN now carries out an investment program of about US$3.5 billion annually.&#13;
Sector Issues and Strategy&#13;
1.8    The task ahead Notwithstanding the impressive achievements highlighted above, only 40% of&#13;
rural households have electricity--well below reported levels in Thailand (about 75%) and Malaysia&#13;
(about 98%). Electricity consumption per capita is only around 260 kWh per year, less than in many&#13;
countries with lower GDP per capita. Many businesses depend on captive power for part or all of their&#13;
supply. Frequent outages and voltage and frequency fluctuations impose high costs for industrial and&#13;
commercial customers, while in some areas network bottlenecks delay and/or increase the costs of new&#13;
industrial ventures.1 To cope with this situation, businesses have to date installed some 10,500 MW of&#13;
captive power generators of which some 8,000 MW is in the form of relatively small, inefficient and&#13;
high cost diesel plants. Finally, the wide disparities in coverage -- urban-rural as well as across Indonesia&#13;
-- pose a direct challenge to the Government's objective of achieving a balanced spatial distribution of&#13;
development and to reduce the inequality in quality of life.&#13;
1.9    Challenges Organizing the power sector --industry structure, regulation, planning, balancing the&#13;
roles of PLN and the private sector --to bring about marked improvements in service delivery standards&#13;
and bring them in line with regional best practice, while maintaining competitive prices, and quickly and&#13;
efficiently expanding the access of electricity to households throughout the country, poses a formidable&#13;
challenge. Prospects for attracting the large sums of money required year-in-and-out to just one sector in&#13;
Indonesia -- US$ 5-6 billion per year -- must also be viewed against the backdrop that the Government is&#13;
hard pressed to maintain past levels of financial contributions to PLN, because of increasing demands on&#13;
its resources from priority social sectors. Further, the task of financing expansion of rural electrification&#13;
(RE) coverage and more generally service provision outside Java is daunting to say the least; due to the&#13;
geographic dispersion and low energy demand of much of the rural population, the unit costs of&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

conventional means of electrification by grid extension and diesel generation are extremely high&#13;
especially outside Java.&#13;
1.10   Strategy The Government, with Bank assistance, has formulated and initiated a major reform of&#13;
the sector. The four pillars of the ongoing reform are: (i) move the sector from monopoly and&#13;
government domination to a multi-operator mixed ownership environment in order to access additional&#13;
management and finance capacity; (ii) decentralize, corporatize and divest PLN, to enhance operating&#13;
performance and client service quality, and to prepare the company to directly access capital markets;&#13;
(iii) reform regulatory and sectoral functions to promote PLN's commercial autonomy and private sector&#13;
entry and thereby promote high quality service at least cost; and (iv) rationalize tariff levels to strengthen&#13;
sector finance, while providing incentives to PLN and the private sector to deliver performance more in&#13;
line with best practices.&#13;

1.11   Indonesia has ratified the FCCC on August 23, 1994, so that it is eligible to receive GEF funds&#13;
under this convention. In order to help fulfill its FCCC national commitments, Indonesia has initiated&#13;
two greenhouse gas mitigation strategy studies. The Asia Least-Cost Greenhouse Abatement Strategy&#13;
(ALGAS) project, financed by UNDP/GEF, examines Indonesia's GHG emission reduction options in an&#13;
Asia regional context. Indonesia is also a participant in the second round of study activities financed&#13;
under the U.S. Country Studies Program. Although both studies are still under preparation, the relevance&#13;
of renewable energy as a greenhouse emissions abatement option for Indonesia is clear. The country is&#13;
characterized by a large, growing and dispersed rural population, a substantial fraction of whom are not&#13;
electrified but who presently consume fossil fuel-based energy for lighting and radio and TV services.&#13;
Further, much of the electricity supply outside Java is generated by diesel fuel. As low or zero&#13;
greenhouse gas emitting technologies, renewables based power generation can meet these basic energy&#13;
demands while substituting for higher polluting kerosene, and diesel fuel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

2. RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT&#13;
Renewable Energy for Sustainable Development&#13;
2.1        Indonesia needs to deploy aggressively new and sustainable sources of energy for power&#13;
generation to complement conventional supply options, in order to maintain its economic momentum and&#13;
dynamism while advancing further the impressive gains already achieved in improving the well being of its&#13;
population. For almost two decades, Indonesia's electricity generation capacity has on average doubled&#13;
every five years. Yet, today, nearly 60 percent of the population -- about 115 million people -- does not have&#13;
access to electricity, and usage per capita is low and even below those for countries with lower income per&#13;
capita.&#13;
2.2        Continued and sole reliance on conventional energy sources and delivery modalities will&#13;
impose a massive financing burden on the Government and PLN's customers. Additionally, burning of&#13;
fossil fuels would also contribute to the "greenhouse effect", the primary contributor to global warming.&#13;
Increasing the use natural gas -- as Indonesia has been doing -- is a good idea since gas is a cleaner fuel than&#13;
coal or oil. However, Indonesia's non-exportable natural gas supplies, are ultimately limited. And burning&#13;
natural gas, while reducing local pollution will still contribute to global warming.&#13;
2.3        Another promising solution for Indonesia is increased use of renewable energy sources ---&#13;
"renewables" such as hydropower, biomass, geothermal, solar, and wind -- which are abundant and eco-&#13;
friendly. Until recently, many considered renewables to be expensive and impractical without the provision&#13;
of subsidies. However, electricity generated from renewable energy has been proven to be reliable in&#13;
commercial operations world wide and at a cost that in many cases is competitive with the conventional&#13;
alternatives. Even solar and wind power are now increasingly competitive on account of impressive gains&#13;
made in the last two decades in lowering of capital costs and in raising the conversion efficiency and&#13;
performance. Continued improvements in costs and performance will come as the overall market grows&#13;
and from technological change. Yet, relative to the vast economic potential of renewable energy, the share&#13;
of renewables in Indonesia's electricity generation is small at present. Development of small scale&#13;
renewable power generation in particular can help improve the lot of Indonesia's rural population, many of&#13;
whom will otherwise have to wait 30+ years to get electricity.&#13;
Role for Small Scale Renewable Power&#13;
2.4        Indonesia's efforts to provide electricity to all its citizens poses a technical and cost challenge&#13;
on account of its geography. Nearly 70 percent of Indonesia's population, of an estimated total of 195&#13;
million, lives in rural areas, comprising about 31 million households. The last census recorded 62,000 rural&#13;
villages, of which 39,000 villages outside Java and Bali are dispersed across an archipelago comprising of&#13;
over 13,600 islands and geographically spread over 5,100 kilometers from east to west and nearly 1,800&#13;
kilometers from north to south. Not only are the rural villages often scattered wide and far, so are the rural&#13;
households within a village.&#13;
2.5        Because of the dispersed geography, the cost of supplying power by conventional means is&#13;
very high, especially in islands other than Java-Bali. Outside Java-Bali, PLN's operations are sustained in&#13;
the following three modes: (i) Seven small regional grids operate at low transmission voltages (150 kV or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
lower) and, therefore, experience relatively high network losses. Further, these grids are supplied power by&#13;
smaller scale power plants that are unable to exploit the economies of scale associated with large&#13;
conventional power plants; (ii) Dozens of mini--grids are supplied by one or more interconnected diesel&#13;
power plants in the I to 12 MW unit size range; (iii) There are a large number of isolated small diesel plant&#13;
based operations -- in the 20 to 200 kW size range -- of which there are nearly 1,000 such isolated high cost&#13;
systems in operations, many supplying power only for a few hours in the evening and night time. In&#13;
aggregate, PLN owns and operates about 3,400 diesel plants scattered throughout Indonesia -- over 2,000&#13;
MW of diesel generating capacity -- as a primary means to supply power for rural electrification. Diesel is&#13;
also the marginal fuel -- the fuel that is used to generate power to meet the last increments of demand -- in&#13;
most of the seven regional grids outside Java-Bali.1&#13;
2.6         Renewable energy, a superior alternative for small power generation Whereas on Java-&#13;
Bali PLN can maintain a large interconnected, efficient and modem power system that is profitable, its&#13;
outside Java operations of necessity require numerous and small scale and isolated grids. In particular, the&#13;
conventional power plants outside Java do not offer the benefit of scale economies that their larger&#13;
counterparts on Java can provide. Renewable energy power generation, on the other hand, is well suited for&#13;
small power generation and in a decentralized mode; it offers a cost effective and environmentally superior&#13;
alternative. Further, since small renewable power generation can be situated close to the demand, the&#13;
investment required for transmission lines is reduced significantly or eliminated, as are transmission losses.&#13;
Overall, increased penetration of renewable energy power generation will help reduce the tremendous&#13;
pressures on the Government budget for financing the subsidy associated with government-mandated rural&#13;
electrification (RE) operations of PLN especially outside Java.&#13;
2.7          The renewable energy resources for electricity power generation that have potential for&#13;
development in Indonesia on a significant scale in the near-to mid-term are mini-hydro, biomass&#13;
cogeneration , and mini-geothermal, with typical sizes of 1-15 MW. An ESMAP study in Indonesia&#13;
estimates the market potential of generation from biomass residues to be about 1,800 MW, of which about&#13;
500 MW is in Sumatera, 800 MW in Kalimantan and 380 MW in Java. Whereas the supply potential from&#13;
such residues is far larger, these estimates also reflect the demand in proximity to the resource. The bulk of&#13;
this potential is in: (i) sugar mills, where bagasse is used extensively in sugar processing, for steam and in-&#13;
plant electricity production to meet the mill's process energy needs; (ii) in palm oil mills that use empty&#13;
fruit bunches, fiber and shells for steam and power generation; and (iii) in the rubber, forestry and timber&#13;
industry using waste products. In each case the amount of biomass residues far exceed the capacity of the&#13;
mills to utilize them, so that disposal can be expensive, while posing added environmental problems. The&#13;
utilization of Indonesia's substantial biomass residue resource potential in power generation will also help&#13;
further the Government's goal of fostering energy conservation. The geothermal technical potential in&#13;
Indonesia is estimated to be 16,000 MW, with about half in Java-Bali; the market potential, taking into&#13;
account proximity to demand centers is substantially lower but still large. Moreover, mini-geothermal plants&#13;
(under 10 MW) can be particularly viable for supplying small loads.&#13;
1 The cost of expanding coverage to a large fraction of rural households, using the conventional means of grid&#13;
extensions and scattered diesel generators, is high, especially outside Java (Annex 2.1). The marginal costs of&#13;
generation alone -- PLN's "avoided generation costs' -- for supply at medium voltage (MV), are estimated to be&#13;
about US ¢ 9.3/kWh for the seven regional grids outside Java, as high as US ¢ 20.0/kWh in case of some of the&#13;
diesel-based isolated units and mini-grids.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
2.8         A role for the private sector An attractive feature of small renewable power projects is that&#13;
they are within the capacity of small and medium sized private sector developers, i.e., non-utility&#13;
generators, which could be a variety of entities, such as private firms, state-owned non-utility firms,&#13;
NGOs, cooperatives, or even an independent joint utility-private enterprise. Therefore, they offer an&#13;
avenue for greatly increasing the number of suppliers in the regional power markets; thereby creating&#13;
competitive market-based pressures for more efficient utilization of energy resources and capital investment&#13;
on part of all the suppliers in the power generation market. Thus, the promotion of small power generation&#13;
projects utilizing renewable energy offers the Government a clear path to increasing private sector&#13;
participation in energy markets, a matter of high priority for GOI as well as a matter of priority on the&#13;
Bank's agenda.&#13;
2.9         For some time to come, private sector interest in renewables will be more forthcoming for the&#13;
relatively larger projects within the "small" project category. For example, in the case of mini-hydro,&#13;
indications are that private developers will gravitate more towards the lucrative projects in the 5+ MW size&#13;
range as a minimum size, and which can supply power to a regional grid in contrast to being connected to&#13;
the much smaller scattered diesel grids, or displace PLN's isolated diesel operations.&#13;
2.10        The private sector's interest in projects that serve regional grids outside Java-Bali makes it&#13;
necessary for PLN to take the lead in developing the smaller -- typically 1 to 5 MW -- power plants in the&#13;
more remote locations in Eastern Indonesia; these projects would displace some of PLN's highest cost diesel&#13;
generation that impose a high subsidy burden. The proposed Eastern Indonesia Renewable Energy&#13;
Development Project, under preparation, will finance several small mini-hydro and mini-geothermal PLN&#13;
projects in remote areas of Eastern Indonesia and also provide for technical assistance to help PLN&#13;
mainstream and sustain renewable energy development.&#13;
Government's Strategy&#13;
2.11        The Government of Indonesia (GOI) accords high priority to the participation of private&#13;
operators and investors in power generation. In the case of large power projects, it has been successful in&#13;
attracting world class independent power producers (IPP), with over 7,500 MW of power purchase&#13;
agreements (PPAs) signed and over 2,500 MW of IPP capacity under construction at present. The Bank is&#13;
assisting the Government to better define the rules for entry and competition within the market and define a&#13;
process of applying these rules in a transparent manner to promote orderly and efficient development of the&#13;
large power market.&#13;
2.12        A key element of the Government's strategy for encouraging participation in small power&#13;
generation by the private sector and cooperatives is the removal of a major stumbling block to the small&#13;
power market development; the recent implementation (December 1995), in response to a covenant under&#13;
the Bank-financed and ongoing Second Rural Electrification Project (Loan 3845-IND), of the published&#13;
Small Power Purchase Tariff and a standard simplified power purchase contract governing the sales of&#13;
electricity produced by small projects to PLN3. In this regard, Indonesia is a pioneer in promoting efficient&#13;
development of private sector led small power through an improved policy and regulatory environment, and&#13;
3 Ministry of Mines and Energy decree No. 1895.K/437/M.PE/1995, issued December 8, 1995, published in&#13;
"Business News", issue January 12, 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
during implementation. Whereas the small power purchase tariff applies to all small power projects selling&#13;
to PLN, the Government recognizes that development of the small private power market will be&#13;
predominantly led by small renewable power projects (para 2.8).&#13;
2.13        GOI also recognizes the need to substantially increase the rate and scale of penetration of cost&#13;
effective renewables as a means of ensuring high and environmentally sustainable rates of economic&#13;
growth. Increased penetration of power generation from renewables will have a significant and positive&#13;
impact on the environment by reducing local pollutants such as S02 as well as pollutants of global concern&#13;
such as emissions of green house gases (GHG). To the extent that this development displaces kerosene&#13;
consumption and diesel generation, it reduces the negative environmental impacts of transport, waste&#13;
disposal and burning of these fossil fuels.&#13;
2.14        Indonesia's experience to date with renewables power generation for decentralized rural&#13;
electrification has been mainly a demonstration effort. The role of small renewables as a cost effective&#13;
complement to power supply being fed to PLN's grids has been non-existent in the private sector and is&#13;
minuscule in the case of PLN. Numerous studies, by agencies such as DGEED, PLN, and BPPT have&#13;
demonstrated the significant potential of small renewable power. The time has now come for these projects&#13;
to be developed within the framework of a least-cost rural electrification strategy, rather than as a series of&#13;
individual projects undertaken on an ad hoc basis.&#13;
2.15        A first step in formulating a cohesive strategy and development plan for small renewables has&#13;
been taken with the completion of the Rural Electrification (RE) Master Plan. Financed under the Bank's&#13;
first Rural Electrification Project (Loan 31 80-IND), the RE Master Plan analyzed conventional options for&#13;
grid extensions and use of scattered diesel generation to support isolated mini-grid operations to electrify&#13;
the remaining unelectrified villages. Building upon this effort, under TA financed by the ongoing Second&#13;
Rural Electrification Project (Loan 3845-IND), a Renewable Energy Development Plan is now under&#13;
preparation. Specifically, readily available information on renewable energy resources -- mostly mini-&#13;
hydro, biomass and mini-geothermal -- is being mapped onto the geographical inforrnation system (GIS)&#13;
that was developed as part of the RE Master Plan effort, with a view to identifying spatial matches between&#13;
cost effective renewable power supply potential and electricity demand. A primary objective of this TA is to&#13;
prepare initial development plans for grid connected and decentralized small renewable energy generation&#13;
especially to displace high cost decentralized diesel generation in rural areas off-Java.&#13;
Barriers to the Development of Small Renewable Power Projects&#13;
2.16        Key barriers to the development of small renewable power projects by the private sector are:&#13;
(i) lack of accessibility to and high information costs about the resource as well as the technology; (i) large&#13;
pre-investment costs, relative to conventional energy projects; (iii) lack of medium-to-long-term debt&#13;
financing that is essential to achieve financial viability of such projects that are capital intensive; and (iv) a&#13;
playing field that is not level, especially the lack of fair and transparent rules for the pricing of power sales&#13;
to PLN's grid, lack of specific regulations to control and oversee market access and entry, and weak pricing&#13;
and contract enforcement mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
2.17         The proposed project design, in conjunction with the Bank's ongoing policy dialogue with the&#13;
Government of Indonesia and PLN, directly addresses the barriers to private sector participation that are&#13;
identified above:&#13;
Lack/high cost of resource information Technical information about the potential&#13;
sites -- such as streamflow records, geoscientific data on steam conditions, wind&#13;
speeds data, solar insolation -- are very expensive to collect and take years of effort,&#13;
and are generally the responsibility of one or more Government ministries. Without&#13;
such essential information being readily available to the private sector, they would not&#13;
be able to conduct even a pre-feasibility assessment for a potential project. A technical&#13;
assistance component of the proposed project has been designed to help GOI and PLN&#13;
prepare and make readily available resource information to the private sector. In case&#13;
of the projects pre-identified for the proposed project pipeline (para 3.6), Bank&#13;
managed grant-financed consultants worked closely with the prospective sugar and&#13;
palm oil mill management and staff in helping them better understand the biomass&#13;
resource potential and technical operating issues with deploying cogeneration systems&#13;
and selling power to PLN.&#13;
*     High pre-investment costs The pre-investment costs of conducting a pre-feasibility&#13;
study, detailed feasibility analysis and engineering design are generally a much higher&#13;
percentage of the installed cost of a small renewable power project than in the case of&#13;
larger renewables or fossil fuel generation plants. The Project provides a cost sharing&#13;
grant to the developers of the sub-projects to be financed under the proposed project, to&#13;
lower these high pre-investment costs. For some of the sub-projects identified for the&#13;
proposed project pipeline, Bank managed grant financed consultants have already&#13;
helped to carry out the pre-feasibility studies and feasibility analysis.&#13;
*     Lack of term debt financing Typically, the ratio of initial capital (equipment and civil&#13;
works) costs to operating (labor, fuel and other inputs) costs is higher for small&#13;
4&#13;
renewable projects compared to equivalent conventional thermal power plants . Hence,&#13;
the initial investment to be financed by debt or equity is far greater for small renewable&#13;
projects than for comparable conventional projects. As a result, small renewable&#13;
projects typically require debt financing to be amortized from 8 to 15 years in order for&#13;
the debt amortization payments to match the developer's revenue stream. While&#13;
successive financial sector reforms have removed most policy constraints on term&#13;
lending, due to institutional weakness, at present, medium-to-long-term debt financing&#13;
is available only to a select group of companies in Indonesia. In particular, small&#13;
entrepreneurs and non-traditional projects are crowded out by larger and well&#13;
established entrepreneurs and traditional projects.&#13;
*     Enabling regulatory environment Experience strongly indicates that for the small&#13;
power market to develop and flourish, an effective regulatory environment is needed to&#13;
4 For example, diesel-based projects have relatively low initial capital costs with high fuel costs, while biomass-&#13;
based cogeneration projects have relatively high initial capital costs with virtually no fuel costs since the biomass to&#13;
be used as fuel is a waste by-product that is readily available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
level the playing field against the monopoly power of the dominant utility to whom the&#13;
power would be sold. Small power producers invariably are unable or unwilling to&#13;
marshall the time and expense otherwise necessary to take on the utility in negotiating&#13;
5&#13;
such deals . Fortunately, with respect to this last barrier, Indonesia can be counted as a&#13;
pioneer in having significantly lowered it.&#13;
2.18         Published small power purchase tariff Over the preceding few years, the GOI has&#13;
undertaken significant energy pricing and market reforms. Introduction of the published small power&#13;
purchase tariff and establishing PLN's obligation to buy power from other suppliers, on a "no negotiations&#13;
basis", at a purchase price tied to PLN's "avoided cost" in various regional grids, and under a simple and&#13;
standardized long term contract, represents a big step forward in promoting efficient development of the&#13;
small power market for renewables. First, it opens up access to the power generation market to smaller&#13;
project developers. Second, this approach ensures that only cost effective renewables are developed. Third,&#13;
it facilitates the long-termn commercial debt financing of such projects which depends critically on the terms&#13;
of the long-term power purchase contract.&#13;
2.19        Over the period August through October 1996, PLN solicited applications from qualified&#13;
small power project developers by advertising the tariff and its major provisions in major regional&#13;
newspapers. PLN's published small power -- defined as under 30 MW in Java and under 15 MW outside&#13;
Java -- purchase tariff for renewable power is set at PLN's avoided cost in the respective regions (Annex&#13;
2.3). The initial responses of the private sector to this initiative -- referred to by GOI as the "PSKSK"&#13;
regulation-- are encouraging particularly in Sumatera, Java and Sulawesi.&#13;
2.20        The PSKSK initiative represents a major step in the removal of one of the single largest&#13;
stumbling blocks to small renewables power development by the private sector. However, the prospects for&#13;
this market -- size, scope, number of transactions, rate of growth, and efficiency -- and its sustainability over&#13;
the longer termn will depend upon PLN's ability and sustained commitment to implement this tariff driven by&#13;
the spirit of achieving this objective. Some revisions and refinements to the power purchase contract may be&#13;
required based upon an evaluation of the market experience, especially early-on. For this purpose PLN is&#13;
implementing a monitoring system that will also facilitate Bank supervision of market developments.&#13;
Successful implementation of the PSKSK regulation also requires close coordination, training and getting&#13;
field management staff in PLN's regional units "on board". An existing covenant (Loan 3845-IND) requires&#13;
that PLN shall by June 30, 1998 (or such other date as may be agreed by the Bank), revise and publish the&#13;
small power purchase tariff including the form of the small power purchase contract in accordance with the&#13;
methodology agreed to by the Bank This covenant was reaffirmed with GOI during negotiations for the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
5      Negotiations in the cases of small power contracts typically: (a) result in a protracted process; (b)&#13;
inherently impose a higher and generally crushing burden on the small developers because of the asymmetry in&#13;
information and expertise available to the two parties; and (c) introduce the risk of manipulation by both sides.&#13;
Negotiated prices lower than PLN's avoided cost result in sub-optimal levels of investment in renewable energy,&#13;
whereas prices higher than avoided cost would result in increasing the subsidy burden.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
Renewable Energy Without Subsidies&#13;
2.21        Notably absent from the list of the key barriers impeding renewable energy development&#13;
(para 2.17) is "high cost of renewable energy technologies", i.e., in selected niche areas, on a life-cycle&#13;
basis, the economic cost of electricity produced by renewable energy resources is not more than the cost&#13;
of the electricity from conventional power plants. As a result, in Indonesia and globally, there exists&#13;
today a large market potential for small renewable power, such as mini-hydro, biomass cogeneration,&#13;
mini-geothermal, and wind power, that can be sustained without any financial incentives, such as capital&#13;
6&#13;
subsidies, interest rate subsidies, or preferred tax treatment . While the development of these resources is&#13;
potentially financially attractive to private sector developers, the four barriers identified above (para&#13;
2.17) come in the way of such development. In this situation, what is needed is the Government's&#13;
commitment and presence in: (i) improving the enabling environment -- informational, regulatory,&#13;
financial; and (ii) for an initial period, providing assistance to reduce the pre-investment barriers. This&#13;
approach -- not providing financial incentives or subsidies for investment but providing limited&#13;
assistance for reducing and overcoming pre-investment barriers -- underlies the design of the proposed&#13;
RESPP project in which there are no subsidies provided for the capital investment. Specifically, the GEF&#13;
grant is utilized solely for capacity building, for future market development, lowering barriers related to&#13;
resource information preparation and dissemination, and lowering high pre-investment costs.&#13;
Past Bank Experience and Lessons Learned&#13;
2.22        Overview. The Bank has been active in Indonesia's power sector for twenty-five years during&#13;
which time the Government has borrowed more than US$ 4.7 billion in Bank loans and IDA credits to&#13;
undertake 25 power projects (Annex 2.2). Despite some problems with implementation, past Bank-financed&#13;
PLN projects have helped strengthen PLN's capabilities in almost every aspect of its operations. Over the&#13;
last twenty-five years, the Bank has also engaged the Government and PLN in a dialogue on sector issues.&#13;
In the 1970s and 1980s, this focused mainly on sector planning, tariff and organizational autonomy issues.&#13;
In recent years, beginning with the Sumatera-Kalimantan Project in 1994, the Bank and Government have&#13;
shifted their emphasis towards sector structure, private sector participation and regulation. The Bank is now&#13;
supporting specific interventions where private sector participation is not readily forthcoming: transmission&#13;
and distribution management and investment, sector expansion outside Java, renewable energy and demand&#13;
side management, and rural electrification.&#13;
2.23        Taken altogether, these projects have assisted in the expansion of generation, transmission&#13;
and distribution facilities and rural electrification and institutional development of PLN. The technical&#13;
assistance provided by the Bank has also strengthened PLN's technical and management capabilities in&#13;
engineering, project management capabilities, distribution and rural electrification planning and&#13;
management, and corporate and financial planning. As a result of these efforts, PLN's implementation&#13;
capacity and operational efficiency have increased significantly. The negative lessons largely concern&#13;
implementation. Most projects have suffered delays due to extended procurement cycles. Technical&#13;
6      In the past many governments have and today some still continue to offer attractive financial incentives --&#13;
such as accelerated depreciation, subsidized interest rates, payments for capacity purchased that exceed the utility's&#13;
avoided cost -- to private entrepreneurs and utilities to develop renewable energy resources. Frequently, such&#13;
subsidies have distorted efficient resource allocation and undermined the sustainability of small renewable power.&#13;
lead to over-investrnent in capital intensive technologies without necessarily maximizing energy (kWh), delivered to&#13;
the grid.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
assistance for institutional capacity building has in some cases fallen short of expectations due to limited&#13;
absorptive capacity and inadequate supervision and ownership. However, all power projects completed to&#13;
date have been rated satisfactory by OED.&#13;
2.24       Experience with renewable energy Given the Bank's limited involvement in renewable&#13;
energy projects, there are no relevant Bank reports on past projects. Experience is limited to the ongoing&#13;
IBRD/GEF-financed India Renewable Resources Development Project (Loan 3544-lN/Grant 2449-1N) and&#13;
the Indonesia Second Rural Electrification Project. Relevant lessons learned from the India project are: (i)&#13;
timely project implementation is facilitated by pipeline development, i.e., pre-identification and preparation&#13;
of sub-projects; and (ii) private sector interest in Bank financing fades if the procedures they are required to&#13;
use for procurement are not in line with normal commercial business practices and the process and&#13;
disbursement of funds is not streamlined and fast.&#13;
2.25       Experience with financial intermediation Some of the lessons learnt from  financial&#13;
intermediation loans in Indonesia (Indonesia Financial Sector Development Ln. 3526-IN) and other&#13;
countries are also relevant. This experience indicates that poor subloan recovery has been a problem, but&#13;
that this risk can be reduced by: (i) selecting only the strong and committed commercial banks to&#13;
participate in the Project; (ii) requiring that the private borrowers put in a significant amount of equity;&#13;
(iii) ensuring quality at entry; and (iv) close portfolio monitoring.  These principles have been&#13;
incorporated in the Project design.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
Project Concept&#13;
3.1    The Renewable Energy Small Power (RESP) Project aims to catalyze the creation of private&#13;
sector markets for small-scale renewable energy power projects and to reduce the costs of PLN's rural&#13;
electrification (RE) operations outside Java-Bali. The RESP Project is a pioneering initiative, whose&#13;
initial size is sufficiently large to establish a baseline penetration of such renewables while also&#13;
providing a demonstration effect that can support a critical mass of commercially sustainable projects,&#13;
developed by non-utility generators, which could be a variety of entities, such as private firms, state-&#13;
owned non-utility firms, NGOs, cooperatives, or even an independent joint utility-private enterprise. In&#13;
keeping with the project design concept, the project focus is on a few selected renewable resources. The&#13;
technologies utilized are well proven, and the implementation and delivery modalities would be&#13;
sustainable on a commercial basis. The Project would support the relatively larger projects within the&#13;
category of small renewable projects, with lower risk and in less remote areas, that have high market&#13;
potential, good renewable resource potential and are in proximity to demand centers/regional PLN grids&#13;
that have high "avoided cost" of supply; in general, private sector investment is not expected in Eastern&#13;
Indonesia at this stage (para 2.9). The Project has a strong institutional focus as well.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
3.2    The principal national objectives of the RESP Project are to: (i) facilitate private sectorI led&#13;
development of small renewable power projects selling electricity to a PLN grid on a commercially&#13;
sustainable basis, within the framework of a least cost rural electrification strategy; (ii) promote&#13;
environmentally sound energy resource development in Indonesia and reduce the energy sector's&#13;
dependence on fossil fuels; and (iii) strengthen Indonesia's institutional capacity to sustain renewable&#13;
energy development.&#13;
3.3    The global environmental objective of the RESP Project is to mitigate emissions of CO2 in&#13;
Indonesia. The development of renewable energy sources for power generation would mitigate diesel&#13;
consumption in power generation, and correspondingly mitigate CO2 emissions.&#13;
As clarified in para 3. 1, the term private sector in this context includes entities such as cooperatives and joint&#13;
utility-private enterprise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
Measuring Project Performance&#13;
3.4    Performance Indicators. The key performance indicators for monitoring achievement of the&#13;
Project objectives outlined above are: (i) the number and generation capacity (MW) of private renewable&#13;
energy small power projects financed, which are measures of the extent of the private sector led&#13;
development; (ii) subloan recovery rate, which is a measure of the extent to which the Project is&#13;
successful in establishing a sustainable financing mechanism; (iii) availability of basic resource&#13;
information about potential projects, which is an indication of the potential for future private sector led&#13;
projects; and (iv) diesel displaced, foreign exchange saved and CO2 emissions reduced, which are inter-&#13;
linked measures of the reduction of the dependence on fossil fuels as well as of the global environmental&#13;
objective. Baseline levels and future target levels for each are shown in of Annex 3.1. During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached on the indicators and the target levels.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
3.5    The Project consists of renewable energy based small power generation projects that are&#13;
organized into the (i) Investment component, and (ii) Technical Assistance.&#13;
3.6    Under the investment component, the projects will be owned and operated by private developers,&#13;
who would sell their electricity to PLN under the published Small Power Purchase Tariff (PSKSK), and&#13;
standardized power purchase contract (paras 2.18 and 2.19). While projects from all renewable resources&#13;
are eligible to participate, a pipeline of 15-20 prospective biomass and mini-hydro power projects -- with&#13;
about 60 percent of the installed generation capacity outside Java-Bali -- have been identified with the&#13;
assistance of consultants supported by Bank-managed trust funds (Annex 3.2). Overall, most of the&#13;
projects are in the 5-10 MW range (with an aggregate capacity of about 75 MW). For three of these&#13;
projects ("Group 1"), the bulk of the pre-investment activities will have been completed by loan&#13;
effectiveness, and they are expected to reach financial closure shortly after loan effectiveness; for about&#13;
ten projects ("Group 2"), preliminary screening indicates that they have good prospects, but significant&#13;
pre-investment activities will remain to be conducted after loan effectiveness. The remaining Group 2&#13;
projects would be identified in the first 18 months of the proposed Project.&#13;
3.7    Substantial resources have and continue to be devoted by the project developers as well as the&#13;
Bank to complete preparations for these fifteen projects. Therefore, it is essential for the Government to&#13;
ensure that for these pre-identified projects, PLN reserves the corresponding amounts of firm capacity&#13;
purchases in the respective regions under its "obligation to purchase" in those regions, as provided under&#13;
the PSKSK tariff (para 2.19). During negotiations, agreement was reached that the Government shall&#13;
cause PLN to commit to purchase capacity under its PSKSK initiative for the projects to be supported&#13;
under the proposed Project.&#13;
3.8    The key barriers to the development of renewable energy power by the private sector (paras&#13;
2.16-2.17) are being addressed by a combination of (i) GEF grants, which would finance part&#13;
(specifically, the incremental costs) of the information, transaction and pre-investment costs of the&#13;
private sector developers (paras 3.11, 3.13, 3.17), and (ii) IBRD credit.&#13;
3.9    The private sector developers will finance their investments with a combination of equity and&#13;
credit from commercial banks of their choosing -- the "Participating Banks (PBs)" -- for up to 15 years.&#13;
Four PBs have been identified to date, of which two -- Bank Niaga and Bank Bali -- are private&#13;
commercial banks; a third bank -- Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) -- has been partially divested by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
Government, and the fourth -- Bank Ekspor Impor Indonesia (Bank Exim) -- is State-owned. The PBs&#13;
view these projects as an entry into an attractive niche market. None of these PBs would be appraised by&#13;
the Bank, given that these commercial banks have been classified as financially sound (sehat) by BI&#13;
The loans from the PBs to the developers would be at the prevailing interest rates for similar transactions,&#13;
with the PBs taking responsibility for appraising developer requests for credit, and for bearing the&#13;
commercial risk on the credit extended to a developer (para 3.22). The PBs, in turn, would re-finance 70&#13;
percent of the credit extended to the developers from the IBRD credit made available to them at market&#13;
rates, under onlending arrangements through the Government of Indonesia (GOI). During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached that, except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, GOI will not provide to the private&#13;
developers, whether directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, any loan, subsidy, grant, credit enhancement&#13;
or financing of any kind other than the GEF grants and the credit extended by the PBs under the RESP&#13;
Project.&#13;
3.10   Technical Assistance The TA components of the proposed project are individually identified by&#13;
category and value in Table 3.1. Draft TORs for all components have been prepared in consultation with&#13;
DGEED, and are contained in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) report (para 3.39).&#13;

1/ Includes contingencies but excludes duties and PPN.&#13;
3.11   Out of a total value of US$4.0 million equivalent, 75 percent of TA is directed at project&#13;
implementation support services. A Project Support Group (PSG), reporting to the Director-General&#13;
(DG), DGEED, will be established to assist the private project developers with, inter alia,: (i)&#13;
environmental review of their projects to ensure compliance with World Bank requirements (para 3.42);&#13;
(ii) implementation support in the form of limited technical advice to the project developers in the&#13;
Project pipeline to facilitate the timely and proper implementation of the projects; and (iii) pre-&#13;
investment activities, including administering GEF grants of $100,000 per project for 15 projects to&#13;
potential project developers to assist them with their pre-investment activities, such as pre-feasibility and&#13;
feasibility studies . The developers would commit to undertake the approved activities and the grants&#13;
would be paid only after they had been undertaken, i.e., on a reimbursement basis; and (iv) provide&#13;
regular progress reports for monitoring this component.&#13;
2   Annex 3.3 outlines Bl's bank rating system for monitoring and classifying the financial health and overall&#13;
soundness of state as well as private commercial banks. Any new PBs would also not be appraised by the&#13;
Bank. All PBs would be required to maintain a sehat rating by Bl.&#13;
While the GEF grant of $100,000 is a significant part of the pre-investment cost, it is negligible compared to&#13;
the investment costs, which will typically be in the range of $ 5-10 million per project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
3.12   The remainder 25 percent of technical assistance is for institutional development, specifically&#13;
renewable energy resource information collection and dissemination to be undertaken by DGEED. This&#13;
technical assistance will provide for consultants who will assist the Directorate of Electric Power&#13;
Planning in the preparation of a strategy for renewable energy resource information collection and&#13;
dissemination, and in implementing this strategy. The work will involve gathering geothermal, hydro,&#13;
biomass resource data from available sources potential projects; evaluating their quality and adequacy;&#13;
developing information systems to facilitate disseminating this information; and in providing the&#13;
information to interested developers. During negotiations, agreement was reached that GOI would: (a)&#13;
mobilize by March 1, 1998, consultants acceptable to the Bank to undertake the gathering of available&#13;
information on renewable resources and evaluate their quality and adequacy, and to develop and&#13;
imnplement a simple information system to facilitate the dissemination of this information, in accordance&#13;
with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank; (b) by March 1, 2000, for about 35-50 projects, with an&#13;
emphasis on projects outside Java, upgrade resource information to a level that is sufficient to enable&#13;
the private sector undertake a pre-feasibility study that provides a reliable basis for making an&#13;
investment decision and make this information accessible to the private sector on an equal access basis,&#13;
and (c) prepare, by May 31, 2000, a plan, acceptable to the Bank, for an ongoing program of resource&#13;
information collection and dissemination that would continue after the completion of this TA.&#13;
Project Cost&#13;
3.13   The estimated project costs, inclusive of duties and taxes and physical and price contingencies is&#13;
about US$141.0 million equivalent.  The total financing requirement, including interest during&#13;
construction is about US$141.0 million equivalent; with US$78.5 million equivalent in foreign exchange&#13;
and US$62.5 million equivalent in local costs. Cost estimates are in September 1996 prices and utilizing&#13;
an exchange rate of Rp2,341/US$. Price contingencies for foreign costs are assumed to be 2.4 percent per&#13;
year during the project implementation period, and for local costs at 8.7 percent per year. A summary of the&#13;
project cost estimates is presented in Table 3.2.&#13;

Financing Plan&#13;
3.14   The financing plan is shown in Table 3.3. A proposed Bank loan of about US$ 66.4 million&#13;
equivalent, combined with a GEF grant of SDR3.0 million (US$ 4.0 million equivalent) would finance&#13;
about 50 percent of the project cost. The GEF grant would finance the "incremental costs" of the RESP&#13;
Project (para 3.16)&#13;

3.15   Investment in the project will be financed by a combination of IBRD ($66.4 million) and private&#13;
funds ($69.3 million). The pre-investment, project support (including strategic planning), and resource&#13;
assessment costs will be financed by a combination of GEF ($4 million) and private ($1 million) funds.&#13;
3.16   The GEF grant would finance all the incremental costs of the proposed project. There is an&#13;
incremental cost of $4.0 million associated with the TA component of the project. At present, there is no&#13;
private sector development of small renewable energy power projects in Indonesia. In the absence of the&#13;
RESP project, it is expected that private developers will begin to initiate small scale power projects,&#13;
based on relatively standard technologies such as diesel, under the standardized small power purchase&#13;
tariff; the costs associated with these activities form the baseline costs. The incremental cost ($4&#13;
million) is the difference between the costs associated with the RESP Project and the baseline costs.&#13;
Lending and Funds Allocation Arrangements&#13;
3.17   The proposed Bank loan and GEF grant would be made to the Republic of Indonesia. The Bank&#13;
loan would be provided to GOI, denominated as a single currency (US Dollar) fixed rate loan, with a&#13;
commitment fee of 0.75 percent per annum or such other percentage as established by the Bank on the&#13;
undisbursed amount under the Loan Agreement from time to time. The term would be 15 years,&#13;
including three years grace period.&#13;
3.18   The Government would channel and allocate the loan proceeds to the PBs as follows:&#13;
(i)    For the state-owned PBs,  loan funds would be lent by MOF through a Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreement (SLA), while for the private PBs, loan funds would go in the first instance from the&#13;
Government to BI, through a separate SLA between MOF and BI. BI would then re-lend the loan funds&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
to the private PBs through the respective Onlending Loan Agreements (OLAs) between BI and the&#13;
respective PBs. During negotiations, agreement was reached that signing of: (a) the SLA between MOF&#13;
and BI; (b) at least two SLA/OLAs between MOF/BI and the PBs, on terms and conditions acceptable to&#13;
the Bank, would be conditions of loan effectiveness. Further, signing of an SLA/OLA, acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, between MOF/BI and a PB would be a condition of disbursement of the IBRD loan for each PB.&#13;
(ii)    During negotiations, agreement was reached that in the event of a PB losing its "sehat" status.&#13;
(a) BI would require the concerned PB to take remedial measures within a prescribed period of time to&#13;
regain a '"ehat" status; (b) BI would notify the Government, and the Government would notify the Bank&#13;
that a situation has arisen that may require the reallocation of the uncommitted portion of funds&#13;
previously allocated to the PB; and (c) in the event the PB fails to regain "sehat" status after the&#13;
prescribed period, funds which have been allocated to the concerned PB but have not been committed,&#13;
would on request of GOI, be reallocated to those PBs which continue to be classified as "sehat" and&#13;
which have requests for subloans in excess of their allocations.&#13;
(iii)   The loan allocation to each PB will be part of its SLA/OLA, and will be based upon the PB's&#13;
estimates of its credit requirements for this Project. During negotiations, agreement was reached that.&#13;
(a) MOF/BI would amend, at the request of a PB and with the Bank's approval, the amount of such PB's&#13;
loan allocation once every calendar year: and (b) each PB would pay to the Government, at the same&#13;
rate as the Government would pay to the Bank, commitment fee on the portion of its loan allocation that&#13;
has not been disbursed to the PB.&#13;
(iv)   Loan reallocations During negotiations, agreement was reached that in order to provide&#13;
flexibility and to respond to unforeseen fluctuations in demand for credit, the Bank would approve, on&#13;
the request of GOI, reallocation offunds from PBs that would not be able to utilize their allocatedfunds.&#13;
This would happen for example, in the case of PBs that have: (a) fully committed, or are likely to fully&#13;
commit, their allocation to their subborrowers; (b) used up all the loan funds available on a "first-come,&#13;
first served basis"; and (c) have requests for additional subloans from their subborrowers. Further, upon&#13;
the Bank's request, GOI would be willing to review the need for such reallocations. From the date of a&#13;
reallocation, the PBs would be obligated to pay commitment fee on the undisbursed amount of their&#13;
respective new allocations.&#13;
Subproject Eligibility and Review&#13;
3.19   In the proposed Project, the eligibility criteria for being considered for participation is that the&#13;
subproject should qualify: (i) for sale of electricity to PLN under the PSKSK regulation, and (ii) as a&#13;
renewable energy project under the terms of this tariff. In order to participate in the proposed Project, the&#13;
developers of qualifying subprojects would prepare and submit credit applications to the PBs. After&#13;
assessing the credit application, when a PB is satisfied that it is willing to extend credit to a qualifying&#13;
developer, the PB would submit to the Bank for review the particular subproject, along with a copy of&#13;
the subborrower's project plan. Annex 3.5 provides details of the information required in a subborrower's&#13;
project plan.&#13;
3.20   During negotiations, agreement was reached that the Bank, after reviewing the PB's submission,&#13;
will approve a particular subproject to participate in the Project, with the maximum amount of the IBRD&#13;
loan to be extended to the particular subproject to be determined by the PB. The approval would be sent&#13;
by the Bank to the PB, MOF and DGEED.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
3.21   GEF grant authorization for pre-investment costs  During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached that DGEED, based on the PSG 's analvsis and recommendations, will recommend to the Bank&#13;
for review and clearance the projects, from those already pre-identified and any others subsequently&#13;
identified (para 3.6), that are suitable for pre-investment support (para 3.11). The Bank would send the&#13;
approval to MOF/BI and DGEED.&#13;
Onlending Terms&#13;
3.22   GOI to PBs Loan proceeds would be on-lent to the PBs in rupiahs for a term up to 15 years&#13;
including three years of grace. The onlending rate for the Bank loan to the PBs would reflect the market&#13;
rate for and the PBs' cost of domestic term funds in Indonesia, this rate will be a variable interest rate&#13;
equal to BI's domestic money market certificate (Sertifikate Bank Indonesia -- SBI). This rate would be&#13;
adjusted on January I and July I of each year, based on the average of the three-month SBI maturity&#13;
quotations, during the preceding six months. Further, on January I of each year, commencing January 1,&#13;
1998, the use of the three-month SBI rate as the onlending rate from GOI to the PBs would be reviewed&#13;
with the objective of either ensuring that the three-month SBI rate appropriately reflects the cost of&#13;
domestic term funds or agreeing on an alternative that does reflect this cost. In addition to interest&#13;
payments, the PBs will pay to GOI a commitment fee of 0.75 percent per annum or at such other&#13;
percentage rate as the Government shall pay to the Bank on the undisbursed amount of the Subsidiary&#13;
Loan from time to time.&#13;
3.23   While the Government would nominally bear the foreign exchange risk, in practice most of the&#13;
risk would be borne by the PBs; the Government would be compensated for the cost of bearing this risk&#13;
as the cost of funds from GOI to PBs includes an implicit premium reflecting market expectations&#13;
4&#13;
regarding exchange rate changes&#13;
3.24   PBs to subborrowers (small power producers) During negotiations, agreement was reached&#13;
that proceeds of the Bank loan, along with financing out of the PBs own resources, would be on-lent to&#13;
the subborrowers by the PBs, at market interest rates. The terms for sub-loans would be up to 15 years.&#13;
The terms and conditions of subloans would be freely negotiated between the PBs and subborrowers.&#13;
3.25   GEF Grant During negotiations, agreement was reached that no fees for administering the&#13;
GEF grant would be charged by GOI.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
3.26   Procurement arrangements for the proposed project are summarized in Table 3.4. Procurement&#13;
arrangements will follow the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits,&#13;
published in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996. For the investment component&#13;
where the project would provide funds to financial intermediaries for on-lending to the private sector,&#13;
procurement for equipment and services under $5 million equivalent would be undertaken by the project&#13;
developer in accordance with established commercial practices in Indonesia, and which are acceptable to&#13;
the Bank. Although the PBs do not have formal procurement requirements, they do require clients to justify&#13;
their procurement decisions, and often requiring them to provide comparative price quotations. Under the&#13;
In Indonesia deposit rates are market-determined and capital flows are generally unrestricted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
proposed project, the PBs would require sub-borrowers to demonstrate that the procedures they use to&#13;
procure goods and services are appropriate. The PBs would ensure that the goods and services are procured&#13;
at reasonable prices, taking account of efficiency, economy, reliability, and other relevant factors such as&#13;
terms of supplier credit, availability of spare parts, backup technical advice assistance, warranty&#13;
arrangements.&#13;

3.27    The biomass cogeneration projects will involve procurement of (i) equipment such as boilers or&#13;
turbo-generators, (ii) engineering and installation services, or alternately (iii) turnkey services for the&#13;
design, supply and erection of the boilers and turbo-generators. It is estimated that about two-thirds the&#13;
bid packages for equipment or services will be under $5 million. The prospective mini-hydro projects&#13;
typically consist of two procurement packages: (i) supply and installation of electro-mechanical&#13;
equipment and electrical works and (ii) civil works. For these sub-projects, each procurement package is&#13;
expected to be under $5 million.&#13;
3.28    It is proposed to make available the following options: (i) for individual procurement packages&#13;
to be re-financed by Bank credit, that are valued under US$ 5 million, established commercial practices&#13;
acceptable to the Bank can be used, and (ii) for contracts valued in excess of US$ 5 million, the Bank's&#13;
procedures for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) are to be followed, and utilizing the Bank's&#13;
Standard Bidding Documents in their organization, format and content.  Eligible local suppliers&#13;
competing for the supply of goods under ICB procedures would be eligible for a preference in bid&#13;
evaluation of 15 percent or the import duty, whichever is lower. For contracts estimated in excess of&#13;
US$ 10 million equivalent, a specific procurement notice would be required. The Bank would conduct&#13;
ex-post reviews to ensure that procurement is economic and efficient. For this purpose between 5 and 10&#13;
percent of the contracts would be sampled.&#13;
3.29    Technical assistance Consultants to be financed under the technical assistance component of the&#13;
proposed project -- Table 3.1 -- would be selected in accordance with the Guidelines for the Selection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997 and use the Bank's standard&#13;
contract for Consultant's Services. Specifically, the Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) process&#13;
and procedures described therein would be utilized. All consulting services above US$ 100,000&#13;
equivalent provided by firms, and above US$ 50,000 equivalent to be provided by individuals would be&#13;
subject to the Bank's prior review; further, for contracts below US$ 100,000 equivalent provided by&#13;
firms, and below US$ 50,000 equivalent to be provided by individuals, there would be prior review of:&#13;
(a) the terms of reference, (b) single-source selection of consulting firms, (c) assignments of a critical&#13;
nature, as reasonably determined by the Bank, (d) amendments to contracts for the employment of&#13;
consulting firms raising the contract value to US$ 100,000 equivalent or above; and (e) amendments to&#13;
contracts for the employment of individuals raising the contract value to US$ 50,000 equivalent or&#13;
above. This would result in prior review of 100 percent of the TA contracts. All consulting assignments&#13;
exceeding $200,000 equivalent in contract value will have to be advertised separately to obtain&#13;
expressions of interest. This would form the basis for the short list of qualified firms invited to bid.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
3.30   Table 3.5 shows the allocation of loan and grant proceeds to each Category and the percentage of&#13;
expenditures to be financed in each Category. For the investment component, the Bank loan would be&#13;
disbursed against 70 percent of the sub-loan amount extended from time-to-time by the PBs to the&#13;
project developers. This would cover about 75 percent of estimated foreign expenditures. For the&#13;
Technical Assistance component, disbursements would be against 100% of expenditures. Withdrawal&#13;
applications for consulting firm contracts above US$100,000 equivalent and individual consultant&#13;
contract cost above US$50,000 equivalent would be based on the Bank's full documentation&#13;
requirements; others would be on SOE procedures. Documents supporting SOE's would be retained by&#13;
the PBs, project developers and DG-Budget, and made available for review by the Bank supervision&#13;
missions.&#13;
3.31   In order to facilitate timely disbursement, two Special Accounts (SA) would be maintained by&#13;
MOF at BI, one for the IBRD loan and a second SA for the GEF grant, under terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank. These SAs will be maintained in the name of Director General of Budget,&#13;
Ministry of Finance, using established procedures as discussed in the following. After initial deposits by&#13;
the Bank into these accounts, further replenishment would take place upon the Bank receiving&#13;
applications for withdrawals from GOI/MOF. Replenishment to the SAs will be made on a monthly&#13;
basis, or when 20 percent of an SA's balance has been used, whichever comes first.&#13;
3.32    Under the investment component, disbursements from the SA for the IBRD loan would be&#13;
triggered by the actions of the subborrowers. The PBs would disburse subloan credit to the subborrowers,&#13;
based on a demonstration of their credit requirements, backed up by the documentation required by the&#13;
PBs. The PBs would periodically submit a request for re-financing 70 percent of the subloan credit&#13;
amounts to MOF, which would issue a payment authorization to BI. In turn, BI would transfer the loan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
funds from the SA to the PBs. MOF officials have indicated that the time from the receipt of the payment&#13;
request at MOF from a PB to the time of payment by BI would be under two weeks. During&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached on procedures and supporting documentation to be utilized by&#13;
MOFfor disbursement of the IBRD loan and GEF grant.&#13;
3.34   GEF Grant Disbursement of the GEF grant for consultancies below the prior review thresholds&#13;
and all sub-grants would be on SOE procedures, with the DG, DGEED to authorize the disbursement&#13;
based upon the PSG verifying the documentation submitted by the project developers.&#13;
3.35   Disbursement Schedule The estimated disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 3.6.&#13;
Disbursements are expected to be relatively small initially since only a limited number of developers will&#13;
be able to achieve financial closure soon after effectiveness, and are expected to accelerate later as more&#13;
developers begin to participate in the Project (para 3.6).&#13;

Implementation&#13;
3.36   A project implementation schedule depicting major milestone dates is contained in Annex 3.7.&#13;
The schedule assumes a loan effectiveness date of October 15, 1997, project completion date of April 30,&#13;
2001, and a loan closing date of October 31, 2001. A more detailed implementation schedule by&#13;
component of the proposed project is contained in the Project Implementation Plan (para 3.39). A&#13;
Procurement Plan which details individual time line for each procurement activity from advertisement to&#13;
contract signing is contained in Annex 3.8.&#13;
3.37   Individual project developers will have primary responsibility for executing their power projects,&#13;
including executing of the power purchase agreement with PLN, obtaining loans from commercial banks,&#13;
and tendering for power plant equipment and construction. The Project Support Group (PSG) will be&#13;
established at DGEED and will provide technical advise and assistance to developers on an as-needed&#13;
basis. It will also be responsible for assisting the developers to prepare the required environmental&#13;
analysis and plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
3.38   Accounting and Audit The project accounts of all PBs and DGEED would be audited by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. During negotiations, agreement was reached that DGEED&#13;
and the PBs would submit their project audit reports to the Bank no later than six months after the end of&#13;
their respective fiscal years. Specifically, the following audit reports would be required: (i) the SOE&#13;
documentation and the SAs maintained by MOF; and (ii) the SOE documentation maintained by the PBs.&#13;
All PBs would provide to the Bank, through BI, the relevant information on disbursements and balances&#13;
and debt-service by each sub-borrower.&#13;
Project Management and Monitoring&#13;
3.39   Project Implementation Plan (PIP) The project implementation and monitoring arrangements&#13;
are detailed in a separate document that is available in the Project files. For the investment component,&#13;
the PIP addresses the following principal elements: scope and objectives, critical success factors, strategy&#13;
and implementation plan, project management structure, milestones, monitoring and reporting&#13;
requirements, implementation schedule, and disbursement schedule. This report will serve as a key&#13;
reference document for the PSG at DGEED and as well as for Bank supervision missions to monitor&#13;
implementation progress and ensure achievement of the development objectives.&#13;
3.40   Project Management For the investment component project oversight will be provided by the&#13;
Director-General (DG), DGEED who would be responsible for ensuring the development impact of this&#13;
component. In undertaking this responsibility, the DG will largely rely on the Project Support Group&#13;
(PSG) that reports to him and that will provide regular progress monitoring reports and flag issues&#13;
requiring attention, and recommend corrective action (para 3.11). The PSG will have: (i) a Manager-&#13;
Team Leader -- a seasoned, senior business development professional acceptable to the Bank -- who will&#13;
have overall responsibility for facilitating the development and financial closure of the biomass&#13;
cogeneration and mini-hydro projects in the pipeline; (ii) a biomass cogeneration technical expert,&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, with demonstrated international power project development experience,&#13;
particularly in cogeneration projects in the sugar industry; (iii) an environmental specialist, acceptable to&#13;
the Bank, who has experience with Indonesian environmental regulations, and explicitly with those&#13;
regulations relevant for the sugar industry; and (iv) other local/foreign short-term technical experts as&#13;
necessary, including a specialist able to assist potential subborowers address the land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement issues as per the Bank's requirements (paras 3.43-3.44) and guiding the project developers&#13;
in reaching compliance. During negotiations, agreement was reached that (i) PSG would be established&#13;
in accordance with TOR, membership, staffing and resources acceptable to the Bank, and (ii) DGEED&#13;
will undertake contracting in a timely manner so that the PSG can be mobilized no later than November&#13;
15, 1997.&#13;
3.41   Project monitoring The Project's performance will be monitored by the PSG in DGEED, who&#13;
will prepare and submit monthly progress reports, and by the Bank's supervision missions and there will&#13;
be a mid-term review. Apart from monitoring and evaluating the progress towards meeting the&#13;
performance indicators, since this is one of the first projects in Indonesia that may involve private&#13;
purchase of land, any such purchases will also be closely monitored. The supervision schedule is shown&#13;
in Annex 3.9. For this purpose it is essential that in the investment component the PSG has easy and&#13;
timely access to the relevant Project information directly from the participating developers. During&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached that (i) DGEED would prepare an annual progress report; (ii)&#13;
furnish it to Bank by December 31 in each year; (iii) review it with the Bank in a timely manner; and (iv)&#13;
take the measures required to ensure the achievement of the Project's objectives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
Environment&#13;
3.42   During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that all sub-projects will&#13;
have to demonstrate environmental compliance of on-going operations with existing relevant national&#13;
environmental regulations. During project implementation a local environmental expert assigned to the&#13;
Project Support Group (PSG), well versed with the sugar industry and acceptable to the Bank, will&#13;
prepare an Environmental Compliance Report (ECR) for each and will guide the project developers in&#13;
reaching compliance.  The outline for the ECR is given in Annex 3.10. In the event that the&#13;
environmental mitigation measures required to achieve compliance, will need additional investments, the&#13;
Participating Bank will ensure that the developer makes the appropriate financial commitments to&#13;
implement these measures. The developer will also commit to obtaining all environmental permits&#13;
required by Indonesian law, for new boiler installations, as needed. The environmental guidelines for&#13;
mini-hydro projects are provided in Annex 3.11. Bank supervision missions will also review the&#13;
environmental compliance reports.&#13;
Land Acquisition and Resettlement&#13;
3.43   All the Group I projects involve increase in the existing capacity of the sugar mills; additional&#13;
land requirements are not envisaged at this stage. The status of the Group 2 sub-projects in regard to the&#13;
need for land acquisition will only be known once the specific projects and then designs are finalized.&#13;
During negotiations, agreement was reached on a policy framework governing land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement issues associated with investment component. Government would also be required to ensure&#13;
that the PBs require the subborrowers to adhere to the agreed policy framework. The draft policy&#13;
framework is contained in Annex 3.12.&#13;
3.44   Where a sub-project results in acquisition of land which is not free of squatters, tenants, or other&#13;
disputes, or where it is acquired by invoking eminent domain, Bank's OD 4.30 will apply. The Project&#13;
Support Group (PSG), assisted by a consultant (para 3.40), will be required to prepare appropriate reports&#13;
in compliance with the agreed policy framework governing land acquisition and resettlement and submit&#13;
to the Bank together with other details for sub-project review (Annex 3.5). An outline of a detailed&#13;
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is contained in Annex 3.13. Bank missions will also supervise the&#13;
implementation of the RAPs where necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
4. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
Rationale For World Bank Involvement&#13;
4.1    Links to Country Assistance Strategy The Bank is committed to supporting renewable energy&#13;
development in Indonesia, as stated in the Indonesia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) that was&#13;
presented to the Bank's Board on March 21, 1995, and the CAS Progress Report that was discussed on&#13;
June 4, 1996. The proposed project design and implementation strategy typify the defining&#13;
characteristics of the transition that is underway in the assistance strategy for Indonesia: (i) achieving&#13;
poverty reduction through increased funding for regional development, and a shift towards smaller and&#13;
regionally oriented projects targeted at reducing urban-rural disparities in the quality of life; (ii) striking&#13;
the appropriate balance between public and private roles in energy distribution; and (iii) increased&#13;
attention to the environment and sustainable management of resources.&#13;
4.2   Links to Economic and Sector Work The proposed project draws upon general economic and&#13;
sector work related to renewable energy as well as analyses undertaken specifically for this project. In&#13;
particular, the project design and strategy are consistent with the findings and recommendations in the&#13;
Bank's rural energy policy paper, the Bank's report on the challenges Indonesia faces in sustaining&#13;
development, and an ESMAP report on Indonesia's biomass potential .&#13;
4.3    Links to ongoing Bank activities in Indonesia The Bank continues to actively support&#13;
implementation of an efficient and sustainable Rural Electrification (RE) program, initiated in the RE I&#13;
Project (Loan 3180-IND) and now through the successor RE II Project (Loan 38450-IND), primarily by&#13;
financing extension of the various regional grids, and related institutional capacity building (para 2.15). The&#13;
RESP project will provide a means to continue the Bank's dialogue with the Government of Indonesia and&#13;
to influence the implementation of a sustainable and environmentally sound RE development program,&#13;
while encouraging private sector participation and the creation of commercial markets for alternative&#13;
energy, and continue the process of improving the policy and institutional environment, all matters of high&#13;
priority on the GOI's as well as the Bank's agenda.&#13;
4.4    Rationale for credit component. At present, in Indonesia, the commercial viability of lending for&#13;
renewable energy small power projects has not been established, and no long-term (10-15 years)&#13;
commercial bank financing is available for small entrepreneurs and non-traditional power project (para&#13;
2.17). Further, it is unlikely that the viability of this type of lending would be established on its own. The&#13;
commercial banks lack familiarity with these types of transactions. The published small power purchase&#13;
tariff and simple standard contract mechanism GOI has implemented (PSKSK regulation (paras 2.18 and&#13;
I   Rural Energy and Development: Improving Energy Supplies for 2 Billion People, A World Bank Best&#13;
Practice Paper, Report 15912-GLB, 1996; Indonesia: Sustaining Development, A World Bank Country Study, 1994;&#13;
Indonesia: Prospects for Biomass Power Generation, Report No. 167/94, ESMAP, World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
2.19) is new, under which no transactions have taken place so far. Furthermore, the maturity structure of&#13;
resources mobilized by commercial banks is relatively short and as much as such banks have to undertake&#13;
term transformation, using short- and medium term resources to lend long term, which again involves a&#13;
higher degree of risk for projects already perceived to be carrying a high degree of risk. Thus, the proposed&#13;
project by providing long term resources to the banks will eliminate one element of the risk. It is expected&#13;
that once our credit is utilized by banks for sound projects they would change their risk perception of&#13;
privately owned renewable energy projects and in future they would be more willing to use their own&#13;
resources.&#13;
Eligibility for GEF Support&#13;
4.5    The RESP project is fully consistent with the: (i) the guidance from the Convention of the Parties&#13;
(COP), and (ii) GEF Operational Strategy, in particular with Operational Program 6, which has the aim of&#13;
promoting the adoption of renewable energy by removing barriers and reducing implementation costs. The&#13;
barriers targeted by this project are: (i) high pre-investment costs, (ii) lack of term debt financing, (iii)&#13;
inadequate regulatory environment, and (iv) lack/high cost of resource information (paras 2.16 -2.17).&#13;
Alternatives To RESP Project&#13;
4.6    The baseline alternative to the RESP project is the business-as-usual scenario under which: private&#13;
sector development of small renewable energy power projects would be greatly inhibited. The costs of this&#13;
baseline alternative were used, inter alia, to develop the incremental costs (para 3.16). This baseline&#13;
scenario is also used in the least-cost analysis.&#13;
Fiscal Impact Analysis&#13;
4.7    Since the investment component of the proposed project is to be executed entirely by the private&#13;
sector, there are no public expenditures for this purpose. While there is a small element of subsidy in the&#13;
Project, this is exclusively for TA, and this is being funded entirely by GEF grants. Further, the commercial&#13;
risk of the subloans to the private producers is being borne entirely by the commercial banks. Thus, the only&#13;
possibility of any adverse fiscal consequences would arise from a default by a participating bank (PB) on its&#13;
loan obligation to the GOI, which is considered unlikely since the PBs have been classified as financially&#13;
sound by BI, and assessed to be among the well-managed banks in Indonesia. Hence, the proposed Project&#13;
would not have any adverse fiscal consequences for the Government.&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
4.8    Least-cost analysis The private developers will be selling electricity to PLN at a tariff that&#13;
reflects PLN's avoided economic costs. This establishes that the financial costs of the profit-making&#13;
private developers will be less than PLN's economic costs of power generation. By itself this result does&#13;
not establish that the private developers' economic costs are less than PLN's economic costs, given the&#13;
possibility of a divergence between the developers' financial costs and their economic costs of&#13;
production, arising from subsidies or other financial incentives. However, there are no such&#13;
subsidies/incentives being offered to the private developers to produce electricity from renewable&#13;
energy. Thus, the financial costs of the private developers are close to their economic costs. It follows&#13;
that the economic costs of the private developers are less than PLN's economic costs, i.e., the power&#13;
produced under this Project represents the least-cost option.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
4.9    Benefits The proposed Project will provide:&#13;
*      Direct economic benefits The direct economic benefit is the electricity produced and sold&#13;
by the facilities financed by this Project.&#13;
*      Local environmental benefits A condition for private developers to participate in the&#13;
proposed Project is that their facilities meet all existing national environmental standards,&#13;
and not just those related to the power generation aspect of their business (para 3.42). Since&#13;
many of the potential participants are not yet in compliance with these standards, the&#13;
proposed Project will lead to local environmental benefit associated with coming into&#13;
compliance with the standards.&#13;
*      Global environmental benefits There are global environmental benefits from  the&#13;
reduction in CO2 emissions (about 10.0 million tons) as a result of the switch from fossil&#13;
fuels to renewable energy 2 This mitigation in emissions is the rationale for the GEF grant.&#13;
*      Regional development benefits About 60 percent of the generation capacity installed by&#13;
the private developers will be located outside Java.&#13;
4.10   Cost-benefit analysis In the cost-benefit analysis, only the direct economic benefits have been&#13;
taken into account because there are no reliable estimates of the other three types of benefits. In particular,&#13;
3&#13;
while the value of the GEF grant could provide an estimate of the global environmental benefits , as&#13;
measured by the international community's willingness-to-pay (WTP), in the proposed Project, the GEF&#13;
grant is for TA only, not for any investment. The direct economic benefits are derived from the estimates&#13;
of the consumers' WTP for the electricity. Based on this analytical framework, the internal economic rates&#13;
of return (IERR) for the biomass projects are typically above 50% (Annex 4. 1).&#13;
4.11    The financial returns to the private developers are lower than the IERR because (i) the&#13;
developers have to pay duties and taxes that are excluded from the economic analysis, and (ii) the&#13;
developers' revenue streams reflect only PLN's avoided costs, which is significantly lower than the WTP&#13;
used in the cost-benefit analysis as the measure of benefits. The developers' nominal financial rates of&#13;
return are estimated to be above 25% while market interest rates are about 18%.&#13;
2      The estimates of the emissions avoided include both the emissions avoided as a result of the units directly&#13;
installed under the RESP project ("project effect") -- about 6.3 million tons of CO2 -- as well as the acceleration of&#13;
market penetration in Indonesia ("programmatic effect") as a result of the RESP project -- about 3.7 million tons of&#13;
CO2. With a total GEF grant of $4.0 million, the unit cost of abatement is about $0.40/ton CO2, including project&#13;
and programmatic benefits, and about $0.65/ton C02, when only project benefits are considered. The primary&#13;
reason for these low abatement costs in the proposed Project is that the GEF grant is for TA only, and not for&#13;
investmnent.&#13;
3      Bank guidelines (OP 10.04, Paragraph 8 (revised September, 1994)) specifically include global&#13;
environmental benefits as a component of a project's benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
Project Risks and Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
4.12   Risks and steps to mitigate risks The Project faces four implementation risks that could&#13;
potentially adversely affect the objective of private sector led development of small renewable power&#13;
projects (Objective A - Annex 3.1):&#13;
*  There are risks that, for a variety of reasons, such as lack of familiarity with the&#13;
technology/resource, perceived problems in dealing with PLN, or high transaction costs.&#13;
private sector developers are either not interested in participating in the Project or that there&#13;
will be some delays in their participation. These risks have been minimized during Project&#13;
preparation by pre-identifying a large number of potential participating developers (Annex&#13;
3.2). Further, PLN will reserve adequate capacity to purchase power from the participating&#13;
developers (para 3.7). In addition, during Project implementation, the developers will be&#13;
provided GEF-funded grants of $100,000 each to cover part of their pre-investment costs,&#13;
and thus increase their interest in undertaking the pre-investment activities. Nevertheless,&#13;
some of the potential participants will either drop out or delay their participation, and this is&#13;
reflected in the performance indicator related to participation (Annex 3.1) and the&#13;
disbursement schedule. Thus, these risks are not expected to have a significant adverse affect&#13;
on the Project's outcome.&#13;
*  There is a risk that commercial banks would not be interested in providing credit to the&#13;
private sector developers. This risk has been minimized during Project preparation by pre-&#13;
identifying four strong commercial banks that have expressed a strong interest in&#13;
participating in this Project (para 3.9) -- which they view as an attractive niche market -- and&#13;
have already begun initial discussion with the potential participating developers. Thus, this&#13;
risk is not expected to have a significant adverse affect on the Project's outcome.&#13;
*  There is a risk that the subloan recovery by the participating banks will be poor, which&#13;
would adversely affect the establishment of a sustainable system of financing renewable&#13;
energy small private power projects. This risk has been minimized during project preparation&#13;
by requiring that the participating banks be classified as sehat (financially sound) by BI, and&#13;
indeed the four participating banks identified to date are among the select group of the&#13;
strongest commercial banks in Indonesia with good credit discipline. During project&#13;
implementation, these strong banks will utilize their standard appraisal criteria in making&#13;
subloans, thus assuring quality at entry. A key factor -- specific to the context of the&#13;
proposed Project -- that would greatly help mitigate the risk of subloan recovery is that the&#13;
subprojects are characterized by a single source of revenue that is based on the off-take&#13;
arrangements spelled out in the power purchase contract between a subborrower and PLN.&#13;
This would allow the PB to attach the revenue stream early on in the event of a default by a&#13;
subborrower; there are ample precedents for such attachments in the much more complex&#13;
and large scale financings associated with the larger private power plants being developed&#13;
worldwide by independent power producers (IPPs). Finally, the actual subloan recovery rates&#13;
will be closely monitored (Annex 3.1).&#13;
*  There are potential technical, implementation and operational risks associated with the&#13;
renewable energy technologies utilized by the private sector. Steps have been taken during&#13;
Project preparation to minimize these risks by limiting technology choices to those that have&#13;
already been proven under actual operating experience in Indonesia or other developing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
countries. Further, during Project implementation, the PSG will be available to provide&#13;
technical and operational assistance on an as-needed basis. Thus, these risks are not expected&#13;
to have a significant adverse affect on the Project's outcome.&#13;
4.13   Sensitivity analysis While the risks identified do affect the number of projects undertaken by the&#13;
private developers during and after the Project, they do not affect the IERR of the projects undertaken.&#13;
Thus, there is no need to analyze the sensitivity of the IERR for these risks.&#13;
Post-project Sustainability and Participation&#13;
4.14   Post-Project Sustainability The proposed Project will lead to a long term sustainable renewable&#13;
energy small power sector. For the private developers, the demonstration effect of commercially viable&#13;
private projects included in the proposed Project will stimulate further private sector participation; some&#13;
international developers have already expressed an interest in undertaking small renewable power&#13;
projects in Indonesia. In addition, sustainability will be enhanced as a consequence of the strengthening&#13;
of the regulatory framework that is ongoing under the broader agenda of sectoral reform. Under the&#13;
Project, developments in the small power market will be monitored and, if necessary, the implementation&#13;
rules and regulations supporting the published small power purchase tariff would be revised as&#13;
appropriate. This supportive regulatory framework, coupled with resource assessments that would be&#13;
made available to the private sector are expected to lead to financial viability in the medium term. The&#13;
participating banks see a promising opportunity and growth market for their services, their interest&#13;
having been vetted by the broader ongoing developments associated with the much larger independent&#13;
power projects (IPPs) that are dominated by off-shore financing. This Project provides them with an&#13;
entry into a lucrative new line of business.&#13;
4.15   Participation The primary stakeholders in the project are: private sector small power project&#13;
developers, industry associations, PLN, Directorate General of Electricity and Energy Development, the&#13;
Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), and the Ministry of Finance. All stakeholders have been and continue to&#13;
be involved to varying degrees in project preparation. A well-attended public launch meeting, co-&#13;
sponsored by the Ministry of Energy and the Chamber of Commerce was held in March 1995 to&#13;
publicize and discuss the RESP project. Since then regular meetings have been held with industry&#13;
associations such as the Sugar Council and its members and the palm oil industry to stimulate the interest&#13;
of their members in biomass cogeneration projects and to help them prepare specific projects for the&#13;
pipeline. During project implementation, the PSG and the Bank's supervision missions will maintain&#13;
contacts with all the key stakeholders and seek their participation in resolving any implementation&#13;
difficulties that may arise.&#13;

RENEWABLE ENERGY SMALL POWER PROJECT&#13;
Performance Indicators&#13;
This annex consists of two tables. Table 1 provides the key performance indicators to be used to&#13;
monitor the progress of the project, while Table 2 provides additional information about inputs,&#13;
outcomes, risks and impact.&#13;
For the purposes of measuring the Project's performance, the national and global objectives (paras&#13;
3.2, 3.3 ) are expressed more concisely as:&#13;
e      Objective A: Facilitate private sector led development of small renewable power&#13;
projects selling electricity to a PLN grid on a commercially sustainable basis.&#13;
-      Objective B: Lower resource information barriers that block private sector investment in&#13;
small renewable power projects.&#13;
Approximate nature of targets Some of the value of the indicators in Table I have been&#13;
derived on the basis of the best possible estimates of the outcomes that depend either upon the future&#13;
behavior of private sector entrepreneurs who have yet to become fully established in this business or&#13;
upon resource information that is not yet available. For this reason, these targets have been stated as&#13;
approximate values rather than as precise numbers.&#13;
Relative weights for evaluation purposes The bulk of the resources under this Project will be&#13;
devoted to the primarily for Objective A (Table 2). While Objective B is important from the projection&#13;
of longer term market development, it is secondary in that the best stimulus for market development is&#13;
from the example set by actual projects on the ground (i.e., the outcome of Objective A).&#13;
*   For Objective A, a "satisfactory" rating would require that, as of the ICR year, (i) the actual&#13;
numerical values are within 80% of the targets, and delays in plan preparation not exceed&#13;
nine months, and (ii) a "highly satisfactory" rating would require that the actual values are&#13;
within 90% of the targets, and delays in plan preparation not exceed six months.&#13;
* For Objective B, A "satisfactory" rating would require that the actual values of the&#13;
indicators are within 80% of the targets, and a "highly satisfactory" rating would require that&#13;
the indicators be within 90% of the targets.&#13;
* The Overall rating for the project would be largely determined by the rating for Objective A.&#13;
The project outcome would be rated "satisfactory" if both objectives are rated "satisfactory".&#13;
For the project to be rated "highly satisfactory", Objective A would have to be rated as such,&#13;
with a "satisfactory" or better rating" on Objective B. By the same token for the project to&#13;
be rated unsatisfactory, Objective A would have to be rated "unsatisfactory".&#13;

The pipeline of prospective project participants consists of (i) about 85 MW of bagasse and other&#13;
biomass cogeneration projects and (ii) 15 MW of mini-hydro projects. Table 1 shows the regional&#13;
distribution of these projects. The projects are in listed two groups: Group I projects, which have had&#13;
feasibility studies completed and are expected to reach financial closure shortly after loan effectiveness, and&#13;
Group 2 projects, most of which have had pre-feasibility studies completed and financial closure is&#13;
expected to take place within one year of loan effectiveness.&#13;

1.2    A Brief Description of Cogeneration of Power in Sugar Mills&#13;
Sugar mills process cane stalks to produce sugar. Sugarcane bagasse is the fibrous residue of&#13;
sugarcane stalks which remain after the juice is removed. Cane sugar mills have traditionally burned their&#13;
bagasse in conventional steam boilers to produce steam, which can be used directly as steam in the sugar&#13;
making process or used to generate electricity for the mill's own use.&#13;
Historically, once the mill's own needs for steam were satisfied, any surplus bagasse was generally&#13;
considered a waste product requiring disposal. Consequently, there was no incentive to maximize the&#13;
efficiency of the energy production from bagasse. There are however, alternatives uses for bagasse such as&#13;
paper making feed-stock, fiber and pressed board feed-stock, furfural and other chemical feed-stock, and as&#13;
a fuel for surplus electricity generation for sale to the grid. As a result, increasing attention is being paid to&#13;
the efficiency of the energy production and use in sugar mills to maximize the bagasse availability for by-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
product revenue generation. Already, there are sugar mills in Central America, Hawaii. Florida, Pakistan,&#13;
Mauritius, and India where substantial amounts of grid supply electricity are profitably produced by the&#13;
sugar industry.&#13;
In Indonesia, the first option for using surplus bagasse to produce power for sale to the grid is to use&#13;
underutilized boiler capacity. A new condensing turbine generator is installed to allow full utilization of the&#13;
surplus bagasse during or after the season to produce electricity for sale to the grid. The majority of the&#13;
projects in Indonesia will fall into this category.&#13;
A second option is to install new boilers with higher temperatures and pressures than are currently&#13;
used by the mills. This results in a technically more efficient use of bagasse, and surplus bagasse can be&#13;
burned to produce more steam that can be utilized in new condensing or condensing/extraction steam&#13;
turbine generators in lieu of or as a supplement to existing back pressure units. As before, excess electricity&#13;
would be fed to a PLN grid.&#13;
A sector environmental assessment (SEA) report for the sugar industry was performed during&#13;
project preparation and is available in the project files.&#13;
1.3    A Brief Description of Participating Sugar Mills&#13;
There are 70 sugar mills in Indonesia producing over 2 million tons per year of sugar. The&#13;
domestic demand is greater than the industry can supply and at least 8 large new sugar mills (10,000 tpd&#13;
cane processing each) are in the planning stages for erection on Sumatera and Sulawesi, while a large&#13;
number of existing mills are also being expanded to the 5,000 - 7,000 tpd size range. Sugar mills in&#13;
Indonesia process from about 2,000 tpd to 12,000 tpd sugar cane for an average 180 day season (150 -&#13;
210 days).&#13;
Of the 70 mills, 58 are public sector mills while 12 are privately owned and operated. Over 50&#13;
of the mills are currently located on Java. About 20 of the public sector mills on Java (the smallest and&#13;
least efficient) are to be closed over the next several years because of land use conflicts and poor&#13;
financial returns. The ages of the mills varies from almost 100 years to less than 5 years. The&#13;
Government policy now encourages the sugar industry growth outside Java and to be heavily private&#13;
sector reliant. The public sector mills that will continue to operate are the ones running most efficiently&#13;
and profitably now. The public sector mills operate under State Corporations that are structured as&#13;
semi-autonomous profit centers that are held accountable for financial performance. RESP projects are&#13;
planned in those public and private sector mills that can provide credit worthy balance sheets.&#13;
The RESP pipeline projects tend to be in sugar mills that are at least 10 years in operation,&#13;
because the newer and larger mills tend to be too far from appropriate grid interconnect (more than 40&#13;
km) and/or are in regions with too low a local kW demand. Projects in the newer (and generally larger)&#13;
mills will take place as PLN grid extensions progress and off-Java population centers continue to grow.&#13;
The RESP pipeline is based on with sugar mills that can project viable sugar making operations&#13;
in the long term (10 - 15 years). The sugar mills tend to be clustered, especially on Java and parts of&#13;
Sumatera, with the clustered mills normally owned by the same company. The projects identified in the&#13;
pipeline will normally be year round (firm power) grid-supply projects where the supplementary fuel will&#13;
be surplus bagasse produced by the project mill, plus surplus bagasse transported from adjacent mills. In&#13;
some cases, this supplementary fuel supply would be transported from a nearby location (normally less&#13;
than 30 km).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
The RESP projects are strategically planned such that mills with existing surplus equipment,&#13;
with expansion plans, or with boiler or steam turbine-generator replacement requirements are priority&#13;
project sites. This approach allows low investment and/or dual cost recovery to be accounted against&#13;
some procurements, and tends to assure the reliability that produces 90+% availability factors in the&#13;
plants. This approach was developed in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture, Indonesia Sugar&#13;
Council, and has allowed the RESP Project to produce a pipeline of potential projects with high&#13;
probability of excellent reliability and good financial returns. As PLN considers the load flow&#13;
implications of all projects before approval and issuance of the PPA, the sugar industry grid supply&#13;
projects can be characterized as being an integral part of a sound power sector development strategy.&#13;

Bank Indonesia's Bank Rating System&#13;
The criteria used by Bank Indonesia (BI) to assess the financial soundness of banks is based on&#13;
an evaluation of five factors -- capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings, liquidity and management --&#13;
considered crucial to the soundness of a financial institution. Ratios, calculated from data provided in&#13;
monthly reports submitted by banks, are compared to the norms see below established by BI for each of&#13;
the five areas of evaluation. An overall rating is then computed and banks informed of their rating by BI&#13;
as appropriate.&#13;
The soundness of a bank is determined on the basis of a reward system for each of the above five&#13;
areas of evaluation. In order to compute the total reward points, the following rule is applied:&#13;
Capital (25 percent): capital adequacy based on a risk-weighted assets as defined under&#13;
the BIS guidelines for the G- 10 countries. All financial institutions are required to reach&#13;
a minimum 5 percent capital ratio by March 1992, increasing to 7 percent by March&#13;
1993 and 8 percent by December 1993. If a bank is below and/or up to the minimum&#13;
capital required, there are no (or zero) reward points. With every increase of 0.01&#13;
percent over the minimum capital requirement, a bank is awarded on reward point;&#13;
Asset quality (30 percent): classified assets as a proportion of total earnings assets of a&#13;
bank. If classified assets are 15.5 percent or above of total earnings assets, there are no&#13;
(or zero) reward points. With every decrease of 0.15 percent from the 15.5 percent&#13;
classified assets to total earning assets ratio, a bank is awarded one reward point;&#13;
Earnings (10 percent): consists of two factors: return on total assets and the ratio of&#13;
operational cost to operational income. If return on total assets is zero or negative, there&#13;
are no (or zero) reward points. With every increase of 0.015 percent in return on total&#13;
assets, a bank is awarded one reward point. If the ratio of operational cost to operational&#13;
income is one, there are no (or zero) reward points. With every decrease of 0.08 percent&#13;
in this ratio, a bank is awarded one reward point;&#13;
Liquidity (10 percent): ratio of total current liabilities to total current assets. If this ratio&#13;
is one, there are no (or zero) reward points. With every decrease of 1 percent in this&#13;
ratio, a bank is awarded one reward point; and&#13;
Management (25 percent): a qualitative factor, is reviewed from many aspects, including&#13;
a bank's internal control systems, MIS, capital position, asset quality, liquidity, lending&#13;
policy, compliance with Bank Indonesia regulations, reporting requirements, etc. Every&#13;
positive aspect of a bank's management is awarded with four-tenths of a reward point.&#13;

The soundness of a bank is rated on the basis of total reward points as follows:&#13;
a.     SEHAT (Sound) - if its reward points range from 81 to 100&#13;
b.     CUKUP SEHAT (Fairly Sound) - if its reward points range from 66 to 80&#13;
c.     KURANG SEHAT (Unsatisfactory) - if its reward points range from 51 to 65&#13;
d.     TIDAK SEHAT (Poor? - if its reward points range from 0 to 50.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
RENEWABLE ENERGY SMALL POWER PROJECT&#13;
Incremental Costs and Global Environmental Benefits&#13;
Broad Development Goals&#13;
1.    Indonesia's basic goals and policies for the development of the energy sector highlight the&#13;
importance of meeting Indonesia's rapidly growing energy needs in an efficient manner, including through&#13;
conservation and diversification of primary energy resources, and minimizing the adverse environmental&#13;
and social impacts of energy use. A key and continuing thrust of the Government's energy strategy is to&#13;
slow down Indonesia's transition to net oil importer status by diversifying energy supply for domestic&#13;
consumption towards alternative and economic indigenous resources that have a non-exportable surplus or&#13;
are non-tradable, such as renewable energy. Rural electrification (RE) is a key and integral part of the&#13;
Government's rural development strategy.&#13;
Baseline&#13;
2.     In Indonesia today, the supply of electricity to rural households depends heavily on diesel-based&#13;
generation. The national power utility (PLN) owns and operates over 5,000 diesel plants scattered&#13;
throughout Indonesia -- about 2,000 MW of diesel generating capacity -- as a primary means to supply&#13;
power for rural electrification. Further, in PLN's present rural electrification plans, the default option is to&#13;
add diesel-based generation capacity. Further, in Indonesia, at present, there are no private small renewable&#13;
energy power projects that sell their output to PLN.&#13;
3.    In these circumstances, the baseline course of action is that PLN will continue to rely on diesel-&#13;
based generation for rural electrification.&#13;
Global Environmental Objective&#13;
4.     The baseline course of action will lead to significant emissions of greenhouse gases (CO2). Thus,&#13;
the global environmental objective of the RESP project is the mitigation of GHG emissions.&#13;
GEF Alternatives&#13;
5.     The renewable energy power projects developed under the RESP project represent the least-cost&#13;
option. The private producers clearly have an incentive to minimize their costs, and these will be less than&#13;
PLN's avoided costs, since the private producers will sell their output to PLN on a tariff based on PLN's&#13;
avoided costs. From the global environmental perspective, the costs of GHG abatement are low since the&#13;
small renewable power projects developed under the RESP project do not need GEF support for investment;&#13;
the private producers need limited GEF support only in the initial phases of developing their projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
Annex 3.4&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
System Boundary&#13;
6.     The RESP project is expected to have programmatic benefits, in addition to the project benefits, by&#13;
demonstrating the financial viability and least-cost nature of renewable energy small power projects. In&#13;
other words, the RESP project will accelerate the penetration of renewable energy small power projects.&#13;
Additional Domestic Benefits&#13;
7.     There are no additional domestic benefits beyond progress towards least-cost provision of&#13;
electricity.&#13;
Costs&#13;
8.     The GEF incremental cost arises from two types of activities: (i) support for the pre-investment&#13;
activities of the private developers as well as guiding and coordinating the power projects through the&#13;
preparation/development phase in the first two years of the RESP project, and (ii) resource assessment and&#13;
management that would not be undertaken by any private individual developer.&#13;
9.     Pre-investment activities The Indonesian project developers will have to hire engineering and&#13;
environmental firms for pre-investment activities, as there is no precedent in Indonesia for the&#13;
implementation of small grid supply renewable energy based projects. It is estimated that the pre-&#13;
investment costs to the potential developers will be in the range $ 125,000 to $250,000, excluding internal&#13;
staff time contributed by the developers. It is expected that about 15 projects would need support for pre-&#13;
investment activities, for a total cost in the range of $2.5 to $3.0 million.&#13;
10.    Support activities There is also a need for a small Project Support Group (PSG) in Indonesia that&#13;
will serve as the guide, manager, coordinator, and trainer for moving the renewable energy projects through&#13;
the preparation/development/implementation process. A lean PSG is expected to have a budget of about&#13;
$1.5 million.&#13;
11.    The total cost of the pre-investment and support activities is $4.0 million. The counter-factual&#13;
expenditure of the private developers is based not on renewable energy development but on the business&#13;
activities that the developers would have otherwise undertaken; this amount is estimated to be $1 million.&#13;
On this basis, the GEF incremental costs are $3.0 million.&#13;
12.    Resource management and assessment Private developers of small hydro and geothermal resources&#13;
face an inhibiting factor that impedes the timely evaluation and implementation of viable power projects:&#13;
lack of information about potential sites. Over the years, PLN has assembled an inventory of hundreds of&#13;
potential small hydro and geothermal project sites, but the level and quality of the inventory information&#13;
assembled varies considerably, and it lacks the organizational structure needed for an efficient commercial&#13;
assessment, integration, and prioritization process that is mandatory, if such inventory is to be disseminated&#13;
to potential developers in a useful form. Under the RESP project, the available information will be&#13;
collected, collated and packaged so that it is usable by potential private developers. This database related to&#13;
hydro and geothermal resources is expected to lead a significant number of renewable energy small power&#13;
projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
Annex 3.4&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
13.    The estimated cost of this database activity is $1.0 million. Given that no private developer can&#13;
undertake this or some similar activity, the GEF incremental cost is also $1.0 million.&#13;
14.    Thus, the GEF incremental cost is $4 million.&#13;
Global Environmental Benefits&#13;
15.    The overall avoided emissions are about 10.0 million tons of CO2, with a total GEF grant of $4.0&#13;
million, leading to a GEF unit cost of about $0.43/ton CO2. The estimates of the emissions avoided include&#13;
both the emissions avoided from investments directly supported ("project effect") by the RESP project (6.3&#13;
million tons of CO2) as well as the investments indirectly accelerated ("programmatic effect") (3.7 million&#13;
tons of C02) as a result of the RESP project. In other words, the impact of the RESP project is measured as&#13;
the difference between the market penetration of the renewable energy technologies with and without the&#13;
RESP project.&#13;
16.    For all of the renewable energy technologies, the estimation of total emissions avoided starts with&#13;
an estimate of the unit emissions avoided factor. Given the likely location of the generation facilities, it is&#13;
assumed the renewable energy technologies will substitute for the regional grids and the Java-Bali grid.&#13;
Based on these substitutions, the avoided emissions are calculated in terms of CO2 tons/GWh. The&#13;
estimated value is biomass cogeneration: 650 tons C02/GWh.&#13;
17.    The unit avoided emissions factors are multiplied by the estimated penetration of the technology to&#13;
arrive at the total emissions avoided. The estimated penetration is based on the projects directly supported&#13;
by the GEF grants as well as the accelerated penetration induced by the GEF supported activities.&#13;

RENEWABLE ENERGY SMALL POWER PROJECT&#13;
GENERAL POLICY&#13;
FOR LAND ACQUISITION, COMPENSATION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
CONCERNING&#13;
MEDIUM AND SMALL-SCALE POWER GENERATION PROJECTS&#13;
1. GENERAL&#13;
Compensation and resettlement policy follows from the national regulations on land acquisition&#13;
(Keppres 55/93). The purpose of Keppres 55 and this policy is to ensure that persons whose&#13;
land, house or other assets, means of livelihood, business, jobs and environment are adversely&#13;
affected, are adequately compensated and do not experience any decline in their living&#13;
standards. The principles and objectives of this policy are stated in the following sections.&#13;
The project developer will also promote public understanding of the process adopted for&#13;
acquisition of land and other affected assets through community information campaign, public&#13;
awareness programs, community level assistance, and the establishment of grievance&#13;
procedures and local level field monitoring to help address any problem experienced by&#13;
communities affected by projects.&#13;
The Policy framework lays down the principles and objectives, eligibility criteria of Project&#13;
Affected Persons (PAPs), entitlements, legal and institutional framework, modes of&#13;
compensation and rehabilitation, peoples participation features and grievance procedures that&#13;
will guide the compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation of PAPs. This policy will be&#13;
followed by the sub-project developers concerned with the Renewable Energy Small Power&#13;
Projects. This policy would also apply to similar small and medium-scale power generation&#13;
projects.&#13;
2. DEFINITIONS&#13;
The terms used in this document are defined as follows:&#13;
(a) 'Project Affected Persons (PAPs)', includes any person or persons who, on account&#13;
of the execution of the project, or any of its component or sub-project or part thereof,&#13;
would have their (i) right, title, or interest in any house, land (including residential,&#13;
agricultural, and under Adat laws) or any other fixed or moveable asset acquired or&#13;
possessed, in full or in part, permanently or temporarily; or (ii) business, occupation,&#13;
work, place of residence or habitat adversely affected; or (iii) standard of living&#13;
adversely affected.&#13;
(b) 'PA' means Project Affected Family, and consists of all members of a household&#13;
residing under one roof and operating as a single economic unit, who are adversely&#13;
affected by the project, or any of its components. For resettlement purposes, project&#13;
affectees will be dealt with as members of Project Affected Families (PAFs).&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of 13&#13;
(c) RAP' means the detailed Resettlement Action Plan prepared for a project, or its&#13;
component, or sub-project where the number of PAPs exceeds 200.&#13;
(d) 'Clearance Space' means the space around the conductors formed by the Minimum&#13;
clearance to the objects as defined by the Regulation of the Minister of Mines and&#13;
Energy for loss and Damage) where no residence or any physical intrusion are&#13;
permitted.&#13;
(e)  'Easement Area' are the areas where the project developers may requires&#13;
temporary passage but no permanent acquisition of land or structure is required.&#13;
(f) 'NJOP (Nilai Jual Obyek Pajak)', is the assessed value of an asset for tax purposes.&#13;
(g) 'Replacement Cost', are the compensation amounts sufficient to replace affected&#13;
assets (land, building, other fixed assets) based on the local market prices at the time of&#13;
the acquisition.&#13;
3. PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
The principles outlined in the World Bank's Operational Directives 4.30 have been adopted in&#13;
preparing this Policy Framework. In this regard the following principles and objectives would&#13;
be applied:&#13;
(a) Acquisition of land and other assets, and resettlement of people will be minimized as&#13;
much as possible.&#13;
(b) Buffer zones, if required, will be delineated based on land ownership, safety and&#13;
environmental considerations. All the land in the buffer-zone will be acquired by the&#13;
project developers.&#13;
(c) All PAPs residing in, working, doing business, or cultivating land, or having rights&#13;
over resources within the project area as of the date of the baseline surveys are entitled to&#13;
compensation for their lost assets at replacement cost and for rehabilitation measures&#13;
sufficient to assist them to improve or at least maintain their pre-project living standards&#13;
and incomes. Lack of legal rights to the assets lost will not bar the PAP from entitlement&#13;
to such compensation and rehabilitation measures.&#13;

1.   In case the impact of the project is marginal to severe such that less than 200 persons&#13;
(about 40-50 families) are affected by the project, a Land Acquisition and Compensation Plan&#13;
(LAP) for each project, sub-project, or component will be prepared and submitted to the Bank&#13;
for review.&#13;
2.   In case the impact of the project is only marginal  i.e. only part assets (farmland,&#13;
residential land, house/structure) are affected, project does not result in any displacement of&#13;
affected families, and the remaining assets are viable for continued use without any adverse&#13;
impact on the living standards or incomes of affected families, the Land Acquisition and&#13;

defined in this policy. To ensure that this policy is carried out effectively, the Project&#13;
Support Group will designate a resettlement specialist to advise project developers&#13;
engaged in any activities requiring land acquisition. The resettlement specialist will&#13;
prepare reports to the project developers and to the Bank assessing the effectiveness of&#13;
resettlement activities. The Project Support Group will make special efforts to ensure&#13;
good community relationships and to promptly address compensation problems and&#13;
complaints. The Project Support Group also will ensure that PAPs are afforded&#13;
opportunities for active and effective participation in preparation and implementation of&#13;
any LAPs or RAPs.&#13;
5.2 Legal Framework&#13;
All land acquisition in Indonesia is regulated by Presidential Decree (Keppres) 55/93&#13;

Page 6 of 13&#13;
(a) The general mechanism for compensation of lost agricultural land will be through&#13;
provision of "land for land" arrangements of equal size, equivalent productivity and at&#13;
location acceptable to the PAP where significantly large or entire land holding is affected&#13;
by the project. In case suitable land is not available, cash compensation at current market&#13;
value will be provided. However, when the portion of the land to be lost represents 25 % or&#13;
less of the total area of the land-holding, cash compensation at full replacement value, will&#13;
be provided to the PAP. In cases where only partial land is affected but the remaining land&#13;
becomes economically unviable, the PAP will be entitled to surrender the entire holding&#13;
and to compensation for entire holding at full replacement value, or land-for-land option.&#13;
(b) The replacement agricultural land will be provided to the PAP free of any tax, transfer&#13;
costs, registration fee or charges.&#13;

holding, cash compensation at full replacement value for only the affected portion of the&#13;
holding will be provided to the PAP. However, where only partial land is affected but the&#13;
remaining land becomes either unviable or in area less than the minimum required under&#13;
the prevailing zoning laws, the PAP will be entitled to surrender the entire holding and to&#13;
compensation for entire holding at full replacement value, or land-for-land option.&#13;
(b) The replacement land for resettlement will be provided in fixed plot sizes according&#13;
to the prevailing zoning laws and planning practices. However, if the lost land of PAP is&#13;
in size larger than the plot sizes for relocation, a cash compensation to cover the difference&#13;
of the area will be given to the PAP.&#13;
(c) The replacement land will be provided to the PAP free of any tax, transfer costs,&#13;
registration fee or charges at the time of transfer.&#13;

replacement cost.&#13;
2.    The procedures adopted for land acquisition and compensation will be as follows:&#13;
-Guidance and Counseling : The Project Team, in co-operation with the head of&#13;
village and sub-district, will arrange a special public meeting with the PAPs&#13;
regarding the project and to elicit their views and concerns. 'Public Information&#13;
Booklet' will be distributed to PAFs.&#13;
-Public consultation with the PAPs will be conducted and will involve related&#13;
government agencies.  The project developers will provide all necessary&#13;
information about the project and related matters, including the timing and&#13;
procedures for compensation assessment and payment.&#13;
-The staking out the boundaries for the required land will be carried out.&#13;
-Detailed mapping of the existing and affected land-holding will be prepared.&#13;
-Following the preparation of maps, complete inventory of affected including land,&#13;
houses and other structures, trees, crops, fixed assets etc. will be prepared.&#13;
-Project developers will prepare a list of compensation for land and other assets&#13;
based on the principle of replacement cost in accordance with this policy&#13;
framework. Any transaction cost, as defined in this policy will be provided by the&#13;
project developers. All records of asset inventory and compensation assessment&#13;
will be kept and reported, and made available to the affected people.&#13;
-The final compensation amount will be negotiated between both parties to reach&#13;
final agreement so that the compensation will be at replacement cost.&#13;
-The final list of affected assets and compensation will be approved and signed by&#13;
both the parties. Grievances in regard to the compensation and other matters will&#13;
be resolved following the procedures outlined in this policy.&#13;
- The final step will be the payment of compensation directly to the land owners&#13;
and other affected persons as agreed between the project developers and the PAPs.&#13;

            Indonesia - Renewable Energy Small Power Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The principal objectives of the
            Renewable Energy Small Power Project are to: (1) facilitate
            private sector-led development of small renewable power
            projects, selling electricity to the state corporation (PLN)
            on a commercially sustainable basis; (2) promote
            environmentally sound energy resource development and reduce
            dependence on fossil fuels; and (3) strengthen
            Indonesia's institutional capacity to sustain renewable
            energy development. Developing renewable energy sources for
            power generation will reduce diesel consumption, and
            correspondingly lower carbon dioxide emissions, which is the
            global environmental objective. The project consists of two
            components:  (1) Investment -identifying prospective biomass
            and mini-hydro power projects, owned and operated by private
            developers, who will sell electricity; and financing
            information, transaction, and pre-investment costs; and (2)
            Technical assistance comprising project implementation
            support and institutional development- a project support
            group will be established to assist project developers with:
            (a) environmental review of their projects as required by
            the World Bank; (b) implementation support in the form of
            limited technical advice to the project developers: and (c)
            pre-investment activities, such as pre-feasibility and
            feasibility studies. This component will also finance
            consultants who will help prepare a strategy for renewable
            energy resource information collection and dissemination,
            and implement this strategy.
