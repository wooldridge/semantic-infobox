Expert&#13;
  Team&#13;
&amp;#12;&amp;#12;What is WET?&#13;
The Water Expert Team (WET) is a technical support&#13;
service that identifies and mobilizes on-demand high-&#13;
level expertise to address complex water challenges in&#13;
World Bank operations. World Bank operational teams&#13;
seek specialized WET support during project preparation&#13;
and implementation to tackle highly complex water&#13;
issues. This additional support informs decision-making,&#13;
promotes innovation and enhances project quality.&#13;

&amp;#12;How the WET Adds Value&#13;
to Projects&#13;
The WET supports World Bank water projects but can                 and emerging needs of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s water-related&#13;
also work cross-sectorally, providing assistance to water-         activities. The experts are engaged as short-term&#13;
related issues in projects in other sectors such as energy,        individual consultants on an as-needed basis. WET&#13;
agriculture, and the environment. The WET works closely            assistance is provided on-demand and is designed to&#13;
with World Bank operational teams to understand their              be fast, easy to use, flexible, and responsive â&#128;&#147; WET&#13;
emerging project needs and identify and mobilize the best          experts can be fielded two to four weeks after a request&#13;
expertise available globally. By facilitating project activities   for assistance has been approved â&#128;&#147; and the application&#13;
that could not be implemented without WET support, it              process is simple and quick.&#13;
adds value to current and future World Bank projects.&#13;
                                                                   The value-added to Bank projects is evidenced by the&#13;
The WET maintains a roster of highly-qualified water               continuous positive feedback received from the WETâ&#128;&#153;s clients&#13;
specialists with expertise not normally available to               and by the growing number of requests being received.&#13;
operational teams, and that corresponds to the current&#13;
&amp;#12;WET Structure&#13;
The WET was created in January 2011 by consolidating&#13;
three Expert Support Teams (ESTs) established to meet&#13;
increasing demand for expertise in water supply and&#13;
sanitation (SWAT), hydrology (HEF), and groundwater&#13;
management (GW-MATE). This merge resulted in a new&#13;
entity with an increasingly responsive structure, and a&#13;
more efficient and streamlined administration.&#13;
&#13;
WET is funded by the Water Partnership Program (WPP),          GW-MATE     HEF&#13;
a Multi-Donor Trust Fund created to enhance the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to reduce poverty through improved water&#13;
services and water resources management, as well as the&#13;
mainstreaming of these in climate-resilient, green growth.          SWAT&#13;
It is based in the Water Anchor (TWIWA) in the Sustainable&#13;
Development Network (SDN) of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
WET is managed by a senior TWIWA staff member&#13;
(the WET Task Team Leader (TTL)), aided by a Support&#13;
Group of technical specialists and a Program Officer. The&#13;
WET TTL and the Support Group ensure that activities&#13;
are in line with the WET objectives, are cost-effective,&#13;
respond to Bank and client needs, and add value to&#13;
Bank operations. A WET Advisory Committee â&#128;&#147; chaired&#13;
by the TWIWA Sector Manager and composed of senior&#13;
members of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s water community â&#128;&#147; advises&#13;
on WET priorities, policy, strategy, and operation, and also&#13;
                                                                    WET&#13;
plays a role in its evaluation.&#13;
&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Features of WET Support&#13;
WET support is normally of short duration and focused          support, and financing of consultant fees and expenses,&#13;
on specific issues, situations or problems. It includes the    as well as technical support. When full-support services&#13;
following activities, among others:                            are requested, the WET team, working closely with the&#13;
                                                               TTL and/or Project Team, participates in:&#13;

   Analytical and Advisory Assistance (AAA) and                   ensuring smooth operation, monitoring and reporting&#13;
   Economic and Sector Work (ESW), Country Assistance          â&#128;¢	Ensuring that consultant outputs are high-quality and&#13;
   Strategies and other strategy and policy documents             support Bank operations according to the ToR&#13;

&#13;
The Water Expert Team (WET) provides on-demand, just-in-time,&#13;
comprehensive technical support in the water sector to operational&#13;
World Bank teams, at the request of Task Team Leaders (TTLs).&#13;
&amp;#12;Progress and Achievements&#13;
Since its creation, the WET has supported activities in&#13;
more than 35 client countries across the six World Bank&#13;
regions. WET assignments have supported World Bank&#13;
projects across all thematic areas in the water sector.&#13;
With a quarter of projects having a main focus on climate&#13;
change adaptation, WET has actively supported new&#13;
pragmatic approaches aimed at incorporating climate&#13;
change in the project design.&#13;
&#13;
WET has also supported non-conventional initiatives&#13;
like the use of deep aquifers for urban water supply in&#13;
Africa and the design of workable solutions for on-site&#13;
sanitation in flood-prone areas. By combining results&#13;
of several activities and organizing knowledge-sharing&#13;
events, the WET actively seeks to stimulate global&#13;
dialogue in water and make innovative ideas available to&#13;
other World Bank teams.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;   The WET team did an outstanding&#13;
job. The team must be commended for&#13;
its efficiency and responsiveness and&#13;
understanding of the TTL needs.&#13;
&#13;
Using WET was a refreshing experience.&#13;
This is a very good example of what&#13;
â&#128;&#156;people in operationsâ&#128;&#157; would like to get&#13;
more often from programs such as the&#13;
WPP.&#13;
