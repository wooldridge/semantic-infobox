This work would not have been possible without the numerous contributions from all&#13;
the agricultural specialists who have participated in conducting Agricultural Risk&#13;
Assessments during the last four years, of whom there are too many to list. The team&#13;
would also like to extend its special appreciation to the stakeholders of agricultural&#13;
supply chains in Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe who actively engaged in&#13;
the development of sector risk assessments in those regions, bringing a great sense of&#13;
realism to this experience. Their active participation obliged the team to be realistic&#13;
and practical.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
In the agricultural sector, risks are inherent and ubiquitous, posing potentially serious&#13;
consequences for stakeholders and consumers. Risks disrupt supply chains, causing&#13;
extensive ï¬&#129;nancial and economic losses. Agricultural risks are also the principal cause&#13;
of transient food insecurity, creating a poverty trap for millions of households across&#13;
the developing world that enforces a vicious cycle of shock and recovery. Climate&#13;
change is exacerbating this cycle by shifting the frequency and intensity of weather-&#13;
related risks and increasing uncertainty.&#13;
&#13;
Eï¬&#128;ective agricultural risk management (ARM) is crucial to increasing economic&#13;
growth, improving food security, and reducing poverty. Although levels of risk vary&#13;
within and between countries, lower-income and highly agriculture-dependent coun-&#13;
tries are more vulnerable to agriculture-related risks. In these countries, there is an&#13;
urgent need to better assess risks, understand the interconnections between diï¬&#128;erent&#13;
types of risk, and improve agricultural risk management strategies.&#13;
&#13;
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR RISK ASSESSMENT:&#13;
AN INTEGRATED APPROACH&#13;
The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s conceptual framework for ARM looks at risk from an integrated&#13;
perspective. The framework views agricultural sector risk assessment (ASRA) as a tool&#13;
to help decision makers understand risk exposure and to provide the basis for develop-&#13;
ing appropriate risk management solutions. ASRA is a consultative, time-bound pro-&#13;
cess that provides an orderly way to analyze, identify, and prioritize risks. The process&#13;
facilitates risk management policy and program design by providing a framework and&#13;
tools for decision making. The ASRAâ&#128;&#153;s target audience includes country-level stake-&#13;
holders involved in selected agricultural commodity systems, development agency&#13;
decision makers, and developing country policy makers.&#13;
&#13;
This report provides methodological guidance for conducting an ASRA. The guid-&#13;
ance is based on the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Agriculture Risk Management Teamâ&#128;&#153;s experience&#13;
assisting governments in conducting sector and key commodity supply chain risk&#13;
assessments in more than 20 countries.&#13;

&#13;
OVERVIEW&#13;
This document provides methodological guidance for conducting an ASRA. It is pri-&#13;
marily designed for use by development practitioners working in the agricultural sec-&#13;
tor in developing countries. Besides presenting the conceptual underpinnings of&#13;
agricultural risk management, the document oï¬&#128;ers practical guidance on the com-&#13;
plexities of developing a holistic ASRA upon which an integrated risk management&#13;
strategy can be designed. Rather than presenting a methodological blueprint, this&#13;
document outlines a practical approach that can be adapted to the particular circum-&#13;
stances of developing economies.&#13;
&#13;
The conceptual framework and step-by-step illustrations presented in this methodo-&#13;
logical guidance are based on nearly a decade of experience of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Agriculture Risk Management Team in assisting developing economies in conducting&#13;
sector and key commodity supply chain risk assessments. Whereas other institutions&#13;
and academic reports oï¬&#128;er insights into the development of tools to assess agricultural&#13;
risks, the guidance herein provides a practical, stepwise approach to conducting&#13;
ASRAs, incorporating the lessons learned from assisting countries in incorporating&#13;
risk management practices into mid-term development strategies. This approach was&#13;
developed and reï¬&#129;ned over time based on experience, but each speciï¬&#129;c assessment&#13;
needs to be adapted to account for a countryâ&#128;&#153;s unique combination of risks, institu-&#13;
tional arrangements, and ï¬&#129;scal constraints.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s conceptual framework for ARM looks at risk from an integrated&#13;
perspective. The framework views risk assessment as a decision support tool for&#13;
designing strategies to manage risks in agriculture. The ASRAâ&#128;&#153;s primary objective is&#13;
to assist developing countries and stakeholders to better comprehend the complexity&#13;
of ARM and to develop appropriate solutions to mitigate, transfer, and cope with&#13;
agricultural risks.&#13;
&#13;
Despite notable progress in this ï¬&#129;eld, much remains to be done to mainstream ARM into&#13;
development planning and investment decisions. The mainstreaming of ARM and&#13;

AGRICULTURAL RISK MANAGEMENT&#13;
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
This conceptual framework for ARM looks at risk from a holistic perspective and&#13;
views the ASRA process as a decision support tool for designing integrated ARM strat-&#13;
egies. The primary objective is to help decision makers understand the risk exposure&#13;
of agricultural sector stakeholders and to provide the basis for developing appropriate&#13;
solutions to mitigate, transfer, and cope with agricultural risks.&#13;
&#13;
An expanding range of experience across several countries and agricultural commod-&#13;
ities has extended and reï¬&#129;ned the ARMTâ&#128;&#153;s understanding of agricultural risks, their&#13;
impacts, and their transmission across the sector as well as the eï¬&#131;cacy of diï¬&#128;erent&#13;
strategies to manage risks. Distilling the experience and lessons learned in more than&#13;
20 countries, the World Bank developed the conceptual framework presented herein&#13;
for assessing agricultural risks with an emphasis on practical application.&#13;
&#13;
This methodology for assessing agricultural risks is based on a decade of lessons&#13;
learned by the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s ARMT, which has conducted numerous sector risk assess-&#13;
ments in Niger, Honduras, Belize, Grenada, Paraguay, Ghana, Rwanda, Malawi,&#13;
Kenya, Senegal, Tanzania, and Mozambique. Likewise, valuable lessons were learned&#13;
from risk assessments for speciï¬&#129;c agricultural supply chains in Ghana (cocoa), Kenya&#13;
(horticulture), Mozambique (cotton), Vietnam (coï¬&#128;ee), Guyana (rice), Haiti (coï¬&#128;ee),&#13;
and Uganda (dairy and coï¬&#128;ee), among others. (See appendix B for a complete list of&#13;
risk assessments completed by the World Bank.)&#13;
&#13;
THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR ARM&#13;
A holistic perspective needs to (i) engage all stakeholders who are aï¬&#128;ected by agricul-&#13;
tural risks and who take actions to manage them; (ii) consider the full range of risks;&#13;
(iii) analyze diï¬&#128;erent strategies to manage risk; and (iv) understand the diï¬&#128;erent steps&#13;
in the risk management process (as summarized in ï¬&#129;gure 2.1). An ASRA typically&#13;
involves prioritizing the major risks aï¬&#128;ecting various stakeholders. The risk prioritiza-&#13;
tion subsequently informs identiï¬&#129;cation of speciï¬&#129;c risk management interventions and&#13;
strategies to be implemented in the short to medium term.&#13;

OPERATIONAL APPROACH:&#13;
HOW TO CONDUCT AN ASRA&#13;
Whereas the previous chapters explained the context, justiï¬&#129;cation, and conceptual&#13;
framework for conducting an ASRA, the remainder of the document focuses on the&#13;
operational steps to apply the framework in practice. As mentioned earlier, rather than&#13;
presenting a methodological blueprint, this document outlines a practical approach&#13;
that can be adapted to the particular circumstances of developing economies. The&#13;
ASRA may be tailored to take into account the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s structure and institutional&#13;
dynamics, including factors such as supply chains, institutions, ï¬&#129;scal constraints, and&#13;
individualsâ&#128;&#153; capacity to deal with the eï¬&#128;ects of realized risks. Likewise, risk manage-&#13;
ment solutions identiï¬&#129;ed in a particular country will not necessarily ï¬&#129;t the context of&#13;
another country, however similar they may appear.&#13;
&#13;
WHAT IS THE OPERATIONAL&#13;
APPROACH?&#13;
A great deal of literature exists on the subject of risk management. No less extensive&#13;
are variations in the understanding and use of terminology. For the purpose of these&#13;
guidelines, the ASRA is considered the process of identifying and prioritizing the&#13;
major risks that explain agricultural gross domestic product (GDP) volatility. Once&#13;
those risks are identiï¬&#129;ed and assessed, the following issue is determining how stake-&#13;
holders manage those risks. This process involves identifying optimal risk management&#13;
solutions to be incorporated into sector risk management strategies led by the public&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
Risk analysis using a holistic framework can be very complex and can involve sev-&#13;
eral stakeholder groups. Stakeholder participation is encouraged through a process&#13;
of facilitation. Given the complexities of agricultural production, processing, and&#13;
commercialization, there is no shortage of risks and potential solutions to manage&#13;
them. Moreover, eï¬&#128;ective risk management generally requires close cooperation&#13;

STEP 1: BACKGROUND RESEARCH&#13;
AND RISK IDENTIFICATION&#13;
The ï¬&#129;rst step of the ASRA process is to gather background information on the&#13;
agricultural sector, collect relevant data for risk analysis, and conduct a desk-level anal-&#13;
ysis before doing ï¬&#129;eldwork. The objectives of this step are the following:&#13;
     Â» Understand the context by analyzing current and past agricultural policies and&#13;
        strategies.&#13;
     Â» Understand the dynamics of the political economy, when possible.&#13;
     Â» Identify the structure of the agricultural sector and the role it plays within the&#13;
        broader economy (for example, size of sector, share in trade, labor in agricul-&#13;
        ture, rural poverty).&#13;
     Â» Analyze trends in time series data for the various commodities related to area,&#13;
        yield, and production.&#13;
     Â» Quantify and analyze variations in yield by commodity and region, noting years&#13;
        that show large drops in yields.&#13;
     Â» Analyze time series rainfall data to determine trends and years of extreme&#13;
        volatility.&#13;
     Â» Match historical drops in yield with realized risks, when possible.&#13;
     Â» Identify major risks by crop, region, and stakeholder group.&#13;
     Â» Analyze levels of vulnerability among various stakeholder groups.&#13;
     Â» Analyze trends and variations in time series data of prices for various agricul-&#13;
        tural commodities and inputs.&#13;
     Â» Analyze trends and levels of volatility in the foreign exchange rate and interest&#13;
        rates.&#13;
     Â» Identify and predict likely impacts from climate change related to projected&#13;
        changes in weather and temperature.&#13;
&#13;
By conducting this background analysis before the ï¬&#129;eldwork, the team can identify in&#13;
advance the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s risk landscape and its disaggregation by commodity and by region.&#13;
This exercise allows the team to become familiar with the country context, the broader&#13;
economy, and more particularly, the agricultural sector. The ï¬&#129;ndings of the background&#13;

STEP 2: RISK QUANTIFICATION&#13;
The task of quantifying losses caused by diï¬&#128;erent risk events is a key step in the ASRA&#13;
process, but it is not easy. Financial losses attributed to agricultural risks are caused by&#13;
a variety of shocks related to production, market, or enabling environment factors.&#13;
The impacts of some risks can be complicated to quantify in monetary terms, whereas&#13;
others cannot be quantiï¬&#129;ed at all. Assigning proxy values can provide an estimate of&#13;
the magnitude of ï¬&#129;nancial losses to allow comparison of risks, paving the way for the&#13;
prioritization of major risks.&#13;
&#13;
Various approaches exist to quantifying risk. The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s ARMT relies primar-&#13;
ily on time series analysis to assess production risks; variations from the historical mean&#13;
to assess market risks; and qualitative analysis to assess enabling environment risks.&#13;
Chapter 5 focuses on how to quantify ï¬&#129;nancial losses using time series analysis when a&#13;
complete set of time series data is available. The chapter also discusses methods for&#13;
quantifying losses under poor data scenarios.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RATIONALE&#13;
Quantifying losses associated with a risk event enables comparison or risk ranking as&#13;
an intermediate step in the risk prioritization process. Loss quantiï¬&#129;cation provides an&#13;
order of magnitude of the indicative losses in terms of agricultural GDP, which helps&#13;
to justify investment in risk management solutions that reduce the impact of external&#13;
shocks and strengthen resilience. In fact, losses are a key piece of information for any&#13;
cost-beneï¬&#129;t analysis for investing in agricultural resilience.&#13;
&#13;
Ideally, if data availability permits, the quantiï¬&#129;cation of losses for each commodity&#13;
under study should be done as part of the deskwork phase before the ï¬&#129;eld visits. The&#13;
ï¬&#129;ndings are very useful for determining the magnitude of loss, its causes, the stake-&#13;
holders aï¬&#128;ected, and stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; capacity to manage. Calculating loss estimates&#13;
before the ï¬&#129;eld visit makes the ï¬&#129;eldwork much more eï¬&#131;cient and helps facilitate dis-&#13;
cussions with stakeholders.&#13;

Several methods can be used to quantify risk, ranging            Alternatively, if time series data of yields cannot be&#13;
from calculating the simple variation from a mean value          obtained or are not reliable, the calculations can be made&#13;

STEP 3: FIELDWORK&#13;
For illustrative purposes, one can imagine deskwork as a â&#128;&#156;top-downâ&#128;&#157; approach, which&#13;
means that the starting points are the sector statistics, programs, and assessment of&#13;
value chains risks and commodities. The ï¬&#129;eldwork, by contrast, can be considered the&#13;
â&#128;&#156;bottom-upâ&#128;&#157; side of the exercise, where the team seeks to have direct one-to-one dis-&#13;
cussions about risks with key stakeholders of major agricultural supply chains.&#13;
&#13;
PURPOSE&#13;
The purpose of ï¬&#129;eldwork is not just to corroborate the ï¬&#129;ndings of the desk assessment,&#13;
but to help the team identify the story line. The team seeks to (i) corroborate the time&#13;
line of events; (ii) test the causality of risks identiï¬&#129;ed; (iii) test whether the losses can be&#13;
validated against what happened in reality; and (iv) assess stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; capacity to&#13;
manage risks. Box 6.1 shows an example of the line of enquiry that needs to be dis-&#13;
cussed by team members as part of the background research and prior to arriving in&#13;
country for the ASRA ï¬&#129;eldwork.&#13;
&#13;
FIELDWORK ACTIVITIES&#13;
Fieldwork consists of a limited number of activities, but these require remaining in the&#13;
ï¬&#129;eld for at least two weeks to conduct interviews with key stakeholders of main supply&#13;
chains. Organizing the timing and logistics of the visit is particularly important when&#13;
the assessment is done in a large country with diï¬&#131;cult access to remote areas and lim-&#13;
ited overnight accommodations. It is advised to plan the trip logistics well in advance,&#13;
including details of appointments, transportation, and interviews. Having a consultant&#13;
with local knowledge who can assist with making arrangements prior to the arrival of&#13;
the risk assessment team has proven to be an indispensable element.&#13;
&#13;
The main activities typically covered during the ï¬&#129;eldwork include the following:&#13;
   (i) Data mining. This is a valuable opportunity to ï¬&#129;ll gaps in the information needed.&#13;
       Some pieces of information exist only in hard copy and only by visiting institu-&#13;
       tions can the team access them. For example, commodity boardsâ&#128;&#153; annual reports&#13;
       have valuable information about supply chain dynamics reported on an annual&#13;
       basis, including causes for drops in volume and logistics and market issues.&#13;

discussed with team members prior to a ï¬&#129;eld assessment.                             FOR AN ASRA IN TANZANIA&#13;
Prior to starting the ï¬&#129;eldwork, the team leader should&#13;
assign responsibilities for speciï¬&#129;c commodities and regions&#13;
to each team member based on spatial considerations. A&#13;
team of four specialists can plan four diï¬&#128;erent routes to&#13;
meet the relevant stakeholders related to a commodity.&#13;
Supply chains are typically located in spatial clusters and&#13;
team members should be able to cover the interviews by&#13;
following a well-planed route. Other commodities, such as&#13;
many food crops (maize, cassava), are virtually every-&#13;
where. Depending on country circumstances, the team&#13;
will agree on how to share responsibilities to cover all&#13;
commodities and their stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
For instance, analyzing risk to livestock activities can take&#13;
three dimensions: (i) farmersâ&#128;&#153; focus groups can be used to&#13;
evaluate systems in which livestock (ruminants) are per-&#13;
manently a part of a rural householdâ&#128;&#153;s production system&#13;
and food security; (ii) for more extensive cattle production&#13;
systems, particularly common in Sub-Saharan Africa, the&#13;
team will need to secure appointments with groups of&#13;
pastoralists potentially gathering at cattle markets around&#13;
towns; and (iii) for more intensive cattle production sys-&#13;
                                                                        ï¬&#129;eld to assess their ï¬&#129;ndings, organize them into standard-&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;CHAPTER SEVEN&#13;
STEP 4: RISK PRIORITIZATION&#13;
As a result of the background research and ï¬&#129;eldwork, the team has already under-&#13;
taken a prioritization exercise for each commodity that shows the ranking of each&#13;
identiï¬&#129;ed risk in terms of (i) the frequency in which risk events occur; (ii) the severity&#13;
of the impact (intensity); and (iii) stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; capacity to manage the identiï¬&#129;ed risk&#13;
events.&#13;
&#13;
VARIABLES FOR RISK PRIORITIZATION&#13;
Categorizing risk in terms of frequency and intensity can be confusing without the use&#13;
of consistent deï¬&#129;nitions or guidelines shared with the team. Again, no magic recipes&#13;
or standardized procedures exist for establishing these categories, but prior discussion&#13;
with team members helps to harmonize an approach. As a general rule of thumb&#13;
based on experience, table 7.1 provides some guidance on how to categorize risks&#13;
based on probability of event (frequency) and severity of impact (intensity or capacity&#13;
to produce losses).&#13;
&#13;
Apart from the frequency of events and the severity of impact, a third variable will&#13;
ultimately determine the ranking of risk: stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; capacity to manage the identi-&#13;
ï¬&#129;ed risk (see ï¬&#129;gure 7.1). For example, if the team ï¬&#129;nds that stakeholders already have&#13;
high capacity to manage a particular identiï¬&#129;ed risk, this particular risk will not be&#13;
ranked among the most important. As mentioned earlier, the capacity to manage each&#13;
identiï¬&#129;ed risk is assessed mainly during stakeholder interviews, but also by using sec-&#13;
ondary information collected during the background work prior to the ï¬&#129;eld visit.&#13;
Chapter 9 addresses the concept of vulnerability and capacity to manage risk in&#13;
greater depth.&#13;
&#13;
PRIORITIZATION MATRIX&#13;
The use of a prioritization matrix helps enormously in categorizing risks in terms of&#13;
frequency and intensity. If team members use this table in a standardized manner,&#13;
results can be shared and discussed among stakeholders and team members in an easy-&#13;
to-understand fashion, and corrections can be made accordingly and quickly. (Recall&#13;

&amp;#12;CHAPTER EIGHT&#13;
STEP 5: PRIORITIZATION OF RISK&#13;
MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS&#13;
In this step the team and stakeholders identify a short list of solutions that they agree&#13;
will make up the optimal strategy for managing risk in the agricultural sector. As&#13;
deï¬&#129;ned in chapter 2, risk management strategies (solutions) fall into three categories:&#13;
risk mitigation, risk transfer, and risk coping. The long list of solutions, categorized&#13;
into these three types of strategies, provides the starting point for this step (ï¬&#129;gure 8.1).&#13;
&#13;
LONG LIST OF SOLUTIONS&#13;
If the line of enquiry was followed during the ï¬&#129;eld visit, the team has identiï¬&#129;ed a list&#13;
of potential solutions that are meant to contribute to the management of identiï¬&#129;ed&#13;
risk. Once the sector risk prioritization matrix is complete (recall table 7.3), the team&#13;
analyzes the long list of potential solutions for the prioritized risks in the matrix and&#13;
divides those potential solutions into the three categories of risk strategies. The initial&#13;
long list is often not exhaustive and might not provide concrete next steps, but it does&#13;
provide a menu of options from which to choose. Table 8.1 shows the long list pre-&#13;
pared for an ASRA in Tanzania.&#13;
&#13;
In conducting Paraguayâ&#128;&#153;s ASRA, the team came up with more detailed long list of solu-&#13;
tions organized by subsectors, because a huge gap exists between family agriculture and&#13;
commercial agriculture, such that Paraguay is considered to have a dual agricultural&#13;
system. The team adapted the methodology to devote special attention to family agri-&#13;
culture, the subsector with the vast majority of poor small producers, for whom the&#13;
government identiï¬&#129;ed separate policies, including separate risk management strategies.&#13;

&amp;#12;CHAPTER NINE&#13;
UNDERSTANDING VULNERABILITY TO RISK&#13;
As vulnerability is used to prioritize risks and to design and target risk management&#13;
interventions, assessing vulnerability is an important part of the ASRA. The concept&#13;
of vulnerability can be applied at diï¬&#128;erent levels (that is, farmer, household, commu-&#13;
nity) and over various areas (that is, farm, district, province, region), which can lead to&#13;
confusion. For the purpose of these guidelines, vulnerability is deï¬&#129;ned as the capac-&#13;
ity of stakeholders to manage agricultural risk and recover from exter-&#13;
nal shocks. The capacity to manage risk is assessed during the background work&#13;
prior to the ï¬&#129;eld visit and during the ï¬&#129;eld visit through stakeholder interviews.&#13;
&#13;
Using the methodology outlined in previous chapters provides the team with a good&#13;
overview of the risks with the biggest impacts on the agricultural sector and the overall&#13;
economy. Depending on the size of the sector, the magnitude of the impacts, and the&#13;
variability of their incidence across regions, however, the assessment of aggregate&#13;
losses can sometimes mask the distribution and scope of impacts on speciï¬&#129;c groups of&#13;
stakeholders. The vulnerability assessment is therefore an important tool for more fully&#13;
analyzing the distributional impacts of risks and developing more eï¬&#131;cient risk man-&#13;
agement mechanisms.&#13;

ASSESSMENT&#13;
Understanding risk proï¬&#129;les entails analyzing the roles of diï¬&#128;erent stakeholders across&#13;
the agricultural sector, including the three principal groups (producers, commercial&#13;
sector stakeholders, and the public sector) but also subgroups, and understanding their&#13;
risk management capacities. For example:&#13;
     Â» Who is involved in the value chain analyzed (diï¬&#128;erent stakeholders, segments of&#13;
       population, gender, and so on)?&#13;
     Â» How does the identiï¬&#129;ed risk aï¬&#128;ect diï¬&#128;erent stakeholders (for example, farm-&#13;
       ers vs. processors vs. traders and exporters; consumers vs. producers; regional&#13;

&#13;
Vulnerability variation between households can be seen as&#13;
the function of three factors: sensitivity, adaptive capacity,   TARGETING WOMEN&#13;
and exposure. Sensitivity is the degree of impact of the         In some cases, certain risks may have relatively low impacts&#13;

of household welfare (that is, consumption levels) in            impacts on a particularly vulnerable group of the popula-&#13;
response to a shock. Adaptive capacity is the ability of         tion. Targeting this group with risk management mecha-&#13;

TOWARD A RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY&#13;
Whereas the ASRA steps detailed in the preceding chapters can be standardized to&#13;
some extent, the incorporation of risk solutions into government policies and plans is&#13;
a highly country-speciï¬&#129;c process that cannot be standardized. Each country has its&#13;
own decision-making process that takes place in a unique political economy. Chapter&#13;
10 discusses diï¬&#128;erent approaches for how the risk solutions identiï¬&#129;ed in the ASRA can&#13;
be developed into action plans incorporated into stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; strategies to reduce&#13;
agricultural risks.&#13;
&#13;
ACTIONS AND STAKEHOLDERS&#13;
Eï¬&#128;ective risk management typically requires a combination of measures, some&#13;
designed to remove underlying constraints and others designed to address risk directly.&#13;
Resource availability will often determine what is possible. Whatever the case, inte-&#13;
grated risk management programs are more eï¬&#128;ective than stand-alone programs.&#13;
Translating the risk management strategy (whether mitigation, transfer, or coping) into&#13;
concrete action requires the use of several kinds of implementation instruments. These&#13;
instruments fall into three categories: agricultural investments, TA, and policy support.&#13;
Some examples of risk management measures are highlighted in table 10.1.&#13;
&#13;
Risk management activities involve action by either individual or multiple stakehold-&#13;
ers. Examples of activities that involve action by a single stakeholder include a farmer&#13;
adopting agricultural practices to manage weather, pest, or disease risk or a trader&#13;
using a back-to-back trading strategy or hedging to manage price risk. Other risk man-&#13;
agement strategies necessitate collaboration between two or more actors in the supply&#13;
chain. These include sharing market information to manage price risk or establishing&#13;
better contractual relationships and information sharing to manage counterparty risk.&#13;
&#13;
The private sector can play an important role in managing the types of risk that can be&#13;
handled through market tools such as insurance and futures markets. Futures contracts&#13;
can be used to hedge price risk, for example. Besides private sector stakeholders, actions&#13;
by public institutions, which potentially beneï¬&#129;t many private actors, may be critical for&#13;
successful risk management. These include strategies such as developing early warning&#13;

Agricultural Sector Risk Assessment: Methodological Guidance for Practitioners                                                  57&#13;
&amp;#12;&amp;#12;CHAPTER ELEVEN&#13;
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
Agricultural risk management is an issue of development eï¬&#128;ectiveness, not just a mat-&#13;
ter of kindness to farmers. The increasing presence of risk in the agricultural sector&#13;
may not just exacerbate volatility, but may also become a major impediment to devel-&#13;
opment, economic growth, and poverty reduction agendas. The nature and impor-&#13;
tance of risk issues aï¬&#128;ecting economic growth and poverty reduction vary from&#13;
country to country. So, too, do stark diï¬&#128;erences exist in a countryâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to manage&#13;
agricultural risks. Disparities in risk vulnerability in the agricultural sector tend to be&#13;
greater in lower-income countries, and, within countries, greater among poor than&#13;
more aï¬&#132;uent stakeholders along agricultural supply chains. Thus the need to tailor&#13;
each ASRA to suit the particular realities of developing countries, as one size does not&#13;
ï¬&#129;t all. These guidelines should be considered a practical approach rather than a rigid&#13;
â&#128;&#156;bulletproof â&#128;&#157; methodology.&#13;
&#13;
THE OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE&#13;
The World Bank has gained notable experience in integrating agricultural risk issues&#13;
into country work and lending over the last decade. Attention to agricultural risk issues&#13;
in Country Assistance Strategies (CAS) has also increased during the same period.&#13;
Likewise, ASRAsâ&#128;&#153; ï¬&#129;ndings have informed various lending operations at the project&#13;
level, either as stand-alone projects or as components of a larger intervention to&#13;
increase sector productivity and resilience (box 11.1).&#13;
&#13;
Much work still needs to be done to establish an enabling environment that will foster&#13;
country-led, country-speciï¬&#129;c strategies for mainstreaming agricultural management&#13;
risk measures into agricultural policies and investments. The opportunities for improv-&#13;
ing the development impact through risk mainstreaming include making development&#13;
interventions more responsive to country risk conditions and commitments; making&#13;
these interventions more strategic; and improving the alignment of policies, processes,&#13;
and resources to support such interventions.&#13;

GLOSSARY OF TERMS&#13;
Agricultural risk: Agricultural risk is a combination of the likelihood of the occur-&#13;
rence of a hazardous event or exposure(s) and the severity of losses that can be caused&#13;
by the event or exposure(s). The three main attributes of risk are event hazard, uncer-&#13;
tainty, and losses.&#13;
&#13;
Climate change: Climate change refers to a statistically signiï¬&#129;cant variation in&#13;
either the mean state of the climate or its variability, persisting for an extended period&#13;
(typically decades or longer). Climate change may be due to natural internal processes&#13;
or external forces or to persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the&#13;
atmosphere or in land use. In its Article 1, the Framework Convention on Climate&#13;
Change (UNFCCC) deï¬&#129;nes climate change as a change of climate which is attributed&#13;
directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmos-&#13;
phere and that is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable&#13;
time periods.&#13;
&#13;
Climate: Climate in a narrow sense is usually deï¬&#129;ned as the average weather, or more&#13;
rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant&#13;
quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of&#13;
years. The classic period is 30 years, as deï¬&#129;ned by the World Meteorological Organiza-&#13;
tion (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature,&#13;
precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical&#13;
description, of the climate system.&#13;
&#13;
Constraints: These are conditions that lead to suboptimal performance. For&#13;
example, low yields (symptom) might be caused by lack of access to inputs or poor&#13;
technology.&#13;
&#13;
Enabling environment risk: Sudden changes in the given scenarios where busi-&#13;
nesses take place that can lead to ï¬&#129;nancial losses among agricultural stakeholders&#13;
(for example, unexpected changes in government or business regulations, the mac-&#13;
roeconomic environment, political risks, conï¬&#130;ict, trade restrictions, logistics, and&#13;
corruption).&#13;

&amp;#12;APPENDIX D&#13;
GUIDELINES FOR FOCUS GROUP&#13;
DISCUSSIONS WITH FARMERS&#13;
Basics. A focus group comprises people who have attributes in common and who are&#13;
able to provide information and opinions about the topic or subject that is the focus of&#13;
discussion. Focus groups may be homogeneous or heterogeneous depending on the&#13;
purpose of the focus group meeting (for example, to identify a pattern, a homogeneous&#13;
group is more appropriate, whereas to ascertain perceptions of risks aï¬&#128;ecting a whole&#13;
supply chain, a heterogeneous group is more appropriate).&#13;
&#13;
Although the Ministry of Agriculture counterparts select the focus groups for an&#13;
ASRA, the assessment team should&#13;
    Â» Be careful that no signiï¬&#129;cant power diï¬&#128;erentials exist among group members,&#13;
      as this often results in inï¬&#130;uential people (often men, or better-oï¬&#128; individuals)&#13;
      dominating the discussion.&#13;
    Â» Aim to cover a mixed sample of representative farming entities covering&#13;
      (i) small and (ii) medium farmers.5 Within this continuum, considerable diï¬&#128;er-&#13;
      entiation may still exist within groups and should be accounted for. For example&#13;
      some small farmers (possibly in diï¬&#128;erent regions) may have low input use (for&#13;
      example, limited inputs, family labor) versus high input use (for example, higher&#13;
      input use, hired labor). The level of commercialization may also vary among&#13;
      medium and large enterprises and regions in the country.&#13;
    Â» Keep the size of the focus group manageable. A focus group is most eï¬&#128;ective&#13;
      with 10â&#128;&#147;15 participants.&#13;
&#13;
All three ï¬&#129;eld teams will conduct as many farmer focus group discussions as possible:&#13;
on the major cash crop, on all food crops, and one more cash crop at the discretion of&#13;
the ï¬&#129;eld team member.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5&#13;
    Large-scale farmers will be interviewed separately (key informant interviews).&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;APPENDIX E&#13;
EXAMPLE OF RAINFALL ANALYSIS AND&#13;
CROP PRODUCTION IN GHANA&#13;
Whenever data and time allow, it is useful to conduct an analysis of the relationship&#13;
between rainfall and agricultural yields for main crops and for various regions. An&#13;
example of such analysis is hereby shown for Ghana.&#13;
&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
An analysis of rainfall data provides useful information on the level and distribution&#13;
of rainfall by region and the impact of various rainfall characteristics on crop yields.&#13;
&#13;
Ghana has 99 weather stations located throughout the country, although some regions&#13;
have a higher density than do others. Analysis was based on daily rainfall data from&#13;
1981 to 2010. Figure E.1 shows the distribution of the weather stations (orange dots).&#13;
&#13;
As the weather stations do not have information on the region to which they belong,&#13;
distance from the centroid of each region (i) was calculated for each station (j) using the&#13;
Euclidean distance formula:&#13;
&#13;
                                         (x            ) +( y â&#136;&#146; y )&#13;
                                                       2             2&#13;
                                Dist =        i   xj        i    j&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Where:&#13;
&#13;
  Dist = Euclidean distance&#13;
    xi = longitude from region iâ&#128;&#153;s centroid&#13;
    xj = longitude from station j&#13;
    yi = latitude from region iâ&#128;&#153;s centroid&#13;
    yj = latitude from station j&#13;
&#13;
Each station was assigned to the region whose distance to the centroid was the small-&#13;
est. Reference marks for the centroids of each region are indicated by the blue dots in&#13;

PRIOR TO MISSION&#13;
In the ARMTâ&#128;&#153;s experience, team members on missions who are unprepared spend&#13;
time in stakeholder meetings trying to understand the structure of the sector and sup-&#13;
ply chains instead of focusing on the risks to the sector. This is not the purpose of the&#13;
mission! Consultants should therefore:&#13;
     Â» Read up on ARMTâ&#128;&#153;s previous work and the methodology applied in risk assess-&#13;
       ments.&#13;
     Â» Read the preparatory work already conducted by ARMT on the country (in&#13;
       Dropbox).&#13;
     Â» Prepare background notes on relevant crops of livestock (see table F.1).&#13;
&#13;
During mission: Make sure you take notes! ARMTâ&#128;&#153;s experience is that it is useful&#13;
to start writing during the mission while thoughts are still fresh and to get a better sense&#13;
of where the information gaps are before leaving the country. ARMT understands&#13;
that this is not always feasible given the workload during missions, but you are strongly&#13;
encouraged to think through what you have and what information you need to support&#13;
the risk story that emerges for your commodities. It is so much more diï¬&#131;cult to get the&#13;
information once out of the country, and in ARMTâ&#128;&#153;s experience, this signiï¬&#129;cantly&#13;
delays production of these reports. Additionally, you will need this information for&#13;
your stakeholder presentation.&#13;
&#13;
Post mission (approximately two staï¬&#128; weeks depending on the number of com-&#13;
modities): Please ensure timely submission of your inputs! The lead author depends on your&#13;
work to do his or her job, and the ARMT will spend additional time on the report once&#13;
it is received. After that, it is reviewed in the World Bank before it is sent to the client.&#13;
Hence, the process is long and it is important to avoid delays. Guidelines on writing&#13;
follow.&#13;
&#13;
Writing for ARMT: Because every country is diï¬&#128;erent, the risk story will vary&#13;
between countries and commodities, so no ï¬&#129;xed format exists for ARMTâ&#128;&#153;s reports.&#13;
Nevertheless, certain standards are needed to ensure quality work. Additionally, in&#13;
ARMTâ&#128;&#153;s experience, substandard deliverables from team members (including poor&#13;

SAMPLE TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;

&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
Risks are inherent, ubiquitous, and varied in agricultural systems, perhaps more so&#13;
than in any other area of economic endeavor. They enforce poverty traps and pose&#13;
serious consequences for all stakeholders. The apparent increase in the frequency of&#13;
commodity price spikes and crop failures, added to concerns over climate change and&#13;
food security, have increased global interest in ARM. The prevalence and complexity&#13;
of the multiple risks facing agricultural systems and the failure to address them on an&#13;
ex ante and integrated basis continue to leave countries and their agricultural supply&#13;
chains at risk. The realization of these risks leads to a perpetual cycle of â&#128;&#156;shock-&#13;
recovery-shock,â&#128;&#157; which endangers the sustainability of ongoing initiatives and remains&#13;
a major impediment to the development of most agricultural sectors.&#13;
&#13;
With the objective of mainstreaming agricultural risk management into national sec-&#13;
tor development strategic planning and promoting more resilient and sustainable agri-&#13;
cultural systems, the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Agriculture Risk Management Team provides TA&#13;
that helps clients evaluate agricultural risks and put in place requisite systems for&#13;
improved risk management. ARMTâ&#128;&#153;s ARM framework looks comprehensively at the&#13;
risks to the agricultural sector and comprises (i) risk assessment and prioritization; (ii)&#13;
stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; assessments; (iii) analysis of risk management strategies; and (iv) screen-&#13;
ing of potential risk management instruments.&#13;
&#13;
This activity has the potential to inform agricultural development strategies and invest-&#13;
ment plans as well as the agricultural development programs of development partners&#13;
or donors. By quantifying risk and providing an evidence-based prioritization of risk&#13;
management interventions, it can facilitate objective policy and programming dia-&#13;
logue and help focus design and delivery of TA activities. In the end, however, integra-&#13;
tion of risk management practices into development strategies will reduce the&#13;
short- and medium-term volatility in the agricultural sector and improve resilience in&#13;
the longer term, thus reducing vulnerabilities among agricultural sector stakeholders&#13;

PRIORITIZATION OF RISK&#13;
MANAGEMENT MEASURES IN&#13;
NIGERâ&#128;&#148;A FILTERING APPROACH&#13;
Many risk management measures are complementary in nature and will contribute to&#13;
improved risk management in the short, medium, and long term. In a resource-con-&#13;
strained environment, however, decision makers are compelled to ï¬&#129;nd the quickest,&#13;
cheapest, and most eï¬&#128;ective measures among a myriad of possibilities. Ideally, a&#13;
detailed, objective, and exhaustive cost-beneï¬&#129;t analysis will help in selecting the most&#13;
appropriate intervention options. But conducting a cost-beneï¬&#129;t analysis of a multitude&#13;
of options can be costly and time consuming. As such, using decision ï¬&#129;lters to evaluate&#13;
and prioritize among a list of potential interventions can help in making rational&#13;
resource allocation decisions in lieu of a detailed cost-beneï¬&#129;t analysis. The Agriculture&#13;
Risk Management Team conducted a ï¬&#129;ltering exercise in Niger to prioritize risk man-&#13;
agement interventions using some simple criteria as ï¬&#129;lters (see table K.2).&#13;
     Â» Relative beneï¬&#129;ts: The most beneï¬&#129;cial interventions were those that reduced&#13;
       the hazards, exposures, and losses associated with the various identiï¬&#129;ed risks.&#13;
       Further, if the intervention could lead to additional beneï¬&#129;ts (for example, yield&#13;
       or eï¬&#131;ciency improvements or cost reduction), it was rated highly. Table K.1,&#13;
       taken from the 2013 â&#128;&#156;Niger Agricultural Sector Risk Assessmentâ&#128;&#157; (World Bank&#13;
       2013c), shows the â&#128;&#156;relative beneï¬&#129;tsâ&#128;&#157; ï¬&#129;lter in actions.&#13;
     Â» Relative cost: Without detailed assessments, it may be diï¬&#131;cult to estimate&#13;
       the cost of some interventions. ARMTâ&#128;&#153;s experience is that the â&#128;&#156;relative costâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
       of interventions can be assessed more readily. For example, the cost involved in&#13;
       a large-scale irrigation project is usually much higher than the cost involved in&#13;
       setting up a system for seed distribution.&#13;
     Â» Scalability: Owing to a required prerequisite some interventions may ben-&#13;
       eï¬&#129;t a small group of stakeholders, but other interventions may have much&#13;
       greater potential to be scaled-up and beneï¬&#129;t a much larger group of stake-&#13;
       holders.&#13;

            Agricultural sector risk assessment :
            methodological guidance for practitioners
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In the agricultural sector, risks are
            inherent and ubiquitous, posing potentially serious
            consequences for stakeholders and consumers. Risks disrupt
            supply chains, causing extensive financial and economic
            losses. Agricultural risks are also the principal cause of
            transient food insecurity, creating a poverty trap for
            millions of households across the developing world that
            enforces a vicious cycle of shock and recovery. Climate
            change is exacerbating this cycle by shifting the frequency
            and intensity of weather related risks and increasing
            uncertainty. Effective agricultural risk management (ARM) is
            crucial to increasing economic growth, improving food
            security, and reducing poverty. Although levels of risk vary
            within and between countries, lower-income and highly
            agriculture-dependent countries are more vulnerable to
            agriculture-related risks. In these countries, there is an
            urgent need to better assess risks, understand the
            interconnections between different types of risk, and
            improve agricultural risk management strategies.
