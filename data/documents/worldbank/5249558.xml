    somewhat delayed in latter2003 through early 2004 due to increased political uncertainty&#13;
    in theperiodprecedingandimmediatelyfollowingpresidentialandparliamentary&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
 commendable effort to complete the implementation o f the program before the closing&#13;
 date o f December 31,2004.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                         11.     RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
&#13;
  6. The strong implementation o f stabilization and reform program was accompanied by&#13;
 solid economic recovery following the sharp contraction in 1999:SAM's GDP grew by 5.5&#13;
 percent and 4 percent in 2001 and in 2002, respectively. By 2003, however, the initially&#13;
 buoyant economy slowed down. Real GDP growth declined to 3 percent-lower            thanthe&#13;
 program target o f 3.5-4.5 percent -- due mainly to two reasons. First, the assassination o f&#13;
 the SerbianPrimeMinister Zoran Djindjic inMarch 2003 coupled with the decision to hold&#13;
 early Serbian Parliamentary elections in December 2003 led to political uncertainty,&#13;
 thereby adversely affecting both the implementation of key structural reforms and overall&#13;
 economic activity. Second, the drought in northern Serbia, coupled with insufficient&#13;
 investment and general lack o f competitiveness, led to the unsatisfactory performance in&#13;
 industryandagriculture, therebynegatively affecting growth.&#13;
&#13;
  7. S A M ' s GDP i s expected to grow by about 6 percent in 2004-1.5 percent higher&#13;
than previous projections-reflecting        a strong recovery in industry, due to accelerated&#13;
privatization in 2003, strong growth in services, and a rebound in agricultural output.&#13;
Available data seems to be inline with the noted growth projection. Against the backdrop&#13;
o f a strong recovery inmanufacturing, industrial production in S A M grew by 7.2 percent&#13;
year-on-year inthe first eight months o f 2004. Concurrently, retail sales inthe first seven&#13;
months increased by 13.0 percent year-on-year, reflecting apick up ineconomic activity.&#13;
&#13;
  8. Price developments during the first nine months o f 2004 suggest that the end-year&#13;
target may be breached. Twelve-month inflation stood at 11.1 percent in September,&#13;
drivenby strong wage growth, exchange rate depreciation, administrativeprice hikes, tax&#13;
increases and rising oil prices-all    o f which confirms that that the program's end-year&#13;
target o f 8-9 percent set at the time o f the Third Reviewwill be missed. The credibility o f&#13;
program implementation will determine whether the adverse impact o f the noted one-off&#13;
factors on inflation will bepermanent or temporary.&#13;
&#13;
 9. In response to the noted price developments, the National Bank o f Serbia (NBS)&#13;
tightened the monetarypolicy stance at mid-year.InJune, the N B S raised the interest rate&#13;
on its bills, draining liquidity by close to 0.2 percent o f GDP. In August, it increased the&#13;
required reserve ratio by 3 percentage points to tighten liquidity again after reversing a&#13;
large part o f the interest increase inJuly.&#13;
&#13;
 10.    These measures have been supported by further strong fiscal adjustment. On&#13;
October 19, 2004, the Serbian Parliament adopted the re-balanced budget for 2004,&#13;
which, relying mainly on expenditures cuts, envisages a reduction o f the budget deficit&#13;
from 45.3 billiondinars (3.3 percent o f GDP) to 32.7 billion dinars (2.4 percent o f GDP).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 11.    In early July, the government reached an agreement with the London Club of&#13;
commercial creditors settling Serbia's outstanding USD 2.7 billion debt, which will have&#13;
a favorable impact on the debt dynamics. The agreement provides for 62 percent&#13;
reduction inthe net present value o f such debt, reducingthe country's overall debt burden&#13;
by around 7 percentage points o f GDP.&#13;
&#13;
 12.    As a result o f the combination of higher oil prices, a surge in imports, and slow&#13;
growth o f exports during the first eight months o f 2004, the current account deficit in&#13;
2004 i s projected to increase to 13 percent o f GDP (against 11percent projected at the&#13;
time o fthe ThirdReview).&#13;
&#13;
 13.    Relations with the IMF. On October 25, 2004, the IMF mission and the&#13;
authorities reached an agreement ad referendum on an economic program for 2004-2005&#13;
supported by the IMF under the Extended Arrangement for 2002-05. The objective o f&#13;
the mission was to revise policy targets to ensure continued progress against the&#13;
background of, inter alia, a higher-than-projected current account deficit. The Executive&#13;
Board o f the IMF i s expected to discuss the Fourth Review o f the Arrangement in&#13;
December 2004.&#13;
&#13;
 14.    Macroeconomic Policy Framework. The country has made good progress in&#13;
reducing inflation, attracting foreign direct investment, and buildingup foreign reserves,&#13;
while macroeconomic policies are broadly on track. Placing Serbia on a sustainable&#13;
growth path and increasing the country's resilience to shocks, however, will entail&#13;
unwavering commitment and determined implementation o fpolicy measures aimed at: (i)&#13;
reducing the size of the public sector; (ii)&#13;
                                           altering the composition o f public expenditures;&#13;
and (iii)stepping up progress in those structural reforms that would enhance the&#13;
economy's supplyresponse.&#13;
&#13;
 15.   Consistent with the noted objectives, the authorities have updated the economic&#13;
objectives for 2004-05 and beyond to reflect robust growth in incomes as well as&#13;
employment and address higher inflation and safeguarding a sustainable external&#13;
position:&#13;
&#13;
   0   Real GDP i s projected to increase by 4% - 5 percent in2005, settling at 5 percent&#13;
       in subsequent years as restructuring-related output losses subside, privatization&#13;
       and enterprise restructuring continue, and cumulative FDI inflows reach higher&#13;
       levels,&#13;
   0   End-period inflation in Serbia i s expected to accelerate to 12-13 percent in 2004&#13;
       due inpart to one-off exogenous shocks, but is targeted to fall under 10percent in&#13;
       2005, and to gradually decline to low single digits over the medium term.&#13;
   0   The external current account deficit (before grants) i s projected to increase to 13&#13;
       percent o f GDP in 2004, but decline to 12 percent in 2005 as policies directed at&#13;
       containing domestic demand take effect. To ensure external sustainability and&#13;
       remain consistent with expected financing, the deficit i s projected to decline&#13;
       steadily thereafter based on a recovery o f exports as structural reforms elicit a&#13;
       supply response andprudentpolicies strengthen competitiveness.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      0   The re-balanced budget for 2004 will help lower public consumption, inflation&#13;
          and the current account deficit. Fiscal policy will continue to remain tight in&#13;
          2005. The shift to taxing consumption instead of income will be continued with&#13;
          the introduction o f the VAT inJanuary and the removal o f small taxes. Measures&#13;
          will be taken to improve compliance and tax payer services. The size o f the&#13;
          government will be reduced by lowering the level and improving efficiency o f&#13;
          current expenditures  .&#13;
&#13;
  16.    Against this backdrop and the recent agreement with the authorities inthe context&#13;
 o f the IMF's Fourth Review, IDA considers that the current macroeconomic framework&#13;
 inS A M is satisfactory. The proceeds ofthe second tranche, which are part ofthe revised&#13;
 2004 budget agreed with the IMF,will provide budgetary support to helpthe Government&#13;
 service external debt and implementits poverty reduction agenda.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   111.    PROGRESSAGAINST SECONDTRANCHERELEASECONDITIONS&#13;
&#13;
  17.    As described in the sections above, the Republic o f Serbia has demonstrated&#13;
 satisfactory progress in carrying out o f the reform program. The macroeconomic policy&#13;
 framework i s also deemed satisfactory by the Bank and the IMF. The ensuingparagraphs&#13;
document the status o f the twelve policy actions set forth in Schedule 2 o f the D C A as&#13;
core conditions for the 2"d tranche release.&#13;
&#13;
  18.    The Republic of Serbia has enacted a law on business registration and a law on&#13;
the agencyfor business services, satisfactory to the Association (paragraph 1in Schedule&#13;
2 o fthe DCA). This conditionhasbeenmet.&#13;
&#13;
  19.    Both laws were enacted by Parliament on May 21, 2004. The new legislation i s&#13;
consistent with good Europeanpractices and aims to: (i) a unified Serbian business&#13;
                                                          create&#13;
register that includes all business activities covered under the current Enterprise Law and&#13;
Law on Private Entrepreneurs; (ii)administer the new unified registry through an&#13;
independent administrative agency; (iii) businesses to start activities immediately&#13;
                                            allow&#13;
after registration; (iv) streamline data requirements for each class o f business according&#13;
to European Union benchmarks; (v) expand electronic registration and updating, and&#13;
ensure easy electronic accessibility to the database; and, (vi) create a single unique&#13;
identifying number for each enterprise that would serve all government needs. The&#13;
newly established Business Services Agency (BSA) i s in charge o f administering the&#13;
business registry, which is expected to become fully operational by March 2005. The&#13;
Bank i s currently administering a US$1.6 million grant from Swedish International&#13;
Development Agency, which aims to assist the authorities in financing the start-up&#13;
expenses o f the BSA, including the costs o f hardware and software for the new&#13;
registration system.&#13;
&#13;
 20.    The Government of the Republic of Serbia has prepared a draft enterprise law,&#13;
satisfactory to the Association, and had made it available to the public for public&#13;
discussion and commentary (paragraph 2 in Schedule 2 o f the DCA).          This condition&#13;
has beenmet.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  21.     The first draft o f new law has been prepared by the Working Group at the&#13;
 MinistryifEconomy andPrivatization(MOEP) inthe Fallof2003. This draft underwent&#13;
 some revisions, and was subject to intensive public consultation process, after the new&#13;
 Government came into office in March 2004. It i s expected the law will be enacted by&#13;
 the Serbian Parliament inNovember 2004 (core condition of SAC I1(Republic of Serbia)&#13;
 Board presentation). The new law will not only be closer to the company laws o f market&#13;
 economies, but also easier to use in business planning and in avoiding or settling&#13;
 disputes. This will, inturn, improve the business environment for enterprises and help to&#13;
 attract investment.&#13;
&#13;
  22.     The most important improvements inthe new law can be summarized as follows:&#13;
&#13;
        e                 The limited liability company provisions of the law are more&#13;
           flexible. The minimum capital requirement i s proposed to be reduced from&#13;
           5,000 Euros to 500 Euros per member and there is no longer a requirement o f&#13;
           capital maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
        e                 The law introduces two types of joint stock companies, namely&#13;
           closed and open. The new Serbian closed company will be free o f capital&#13;
           maintenance requirements and will be free to impose restrictions on the transfer&#13;
           o f its shares, but cannot offer its shares publicly and may not have more than&#13;
           100 shareholders unless it adopts and agrees to follow the rules and&#13;
           requirements for an open company.&#13;
&#13;
        e                 A large number of changes are made to encourage good corporate&#13;
           governance. The law expands and clarifies a director's legal duty o f care and&#13;
           duty of loyalty to the company, introduces the concept o f "personal interest",&#13;
           simplifies the structure of the board, makes the establishment o f a supervisory&#13;
           board optional and provides for directors to be elected only by the shareholders&#13;
           andto have only one-year terms.&#13;
&#13;
       e                  The new Law also has detailed provisions for merger, division, and&#13;
           conversion o f a company from one form to another; it imposes new disclosure&#13;
           andother requirements on companies andpersons who control a company andit&#13;
           provides new rules for the liquidation o f a company outside bankruptcy.&#13;
&#13;
       e                 Finally, the new law contains a number o f provisions designed to&#13;
           meet the requirements o f EUCompany Law Directives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 23.     The Republic of Serbia has enacted a bankruptcy law, satisfactory to the&#13;
Association (paragraph 3 inSchedule 2 o f the DCA). This conditionhasbeen met.&#13;
&#13;
 24.    The Law on Bankruptcy was enacted on July 24, 2004 and became effective on&#13;
July 31,2004. The provisions o f the new law are consistent with EUpractices and have&#13;
been designed to minimize the impact o f existing institutional deficiencies in the&#13;
judiciary and the trustee community.          In particular, the new law contains specific&#13;
provisions designed to expedite the opening o f bankruptcy proceedings, as well as a&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 comprehensive section on reorganization o f viable debtors. The Bankruptcy Supervisory&#13;
 Agency will be established under the auspices o f the MOEP by end-December 2004 to&#13;
 license, supervise, and regulate bankruptcy trustees. The MOEP, with United States&#13;
 Agency for Intemational Development (USAID) and Bank support, has developed a&#13;
 general trustee training course and a program to educate the judges on the concepts&#13;
 contained inthe new law. Also by the end o f 2004, a specialized Bankruptcy Unit will be&#13;
 established at the Privatization Agency (PA), and supported by the Bank's technical&#13;
 assistance credit, to act as the bankruptcy trustee for socially- or state-owned enterprises.&#13;
 The bankruptcy process for socially- and state-owned enterprises will continue to be&#13;
 carried out under the authority and supervision o f the courts, as will all other bankruptcy&#13;
 proceedings.     Since the implementation o f the law requires the establishment of two&#13;
 institutions and the certification o f trustees, the application o f the law will start six&#13;
 months from the day o f effectiveness. The Bank is fully satisfied with this arrangement.&#13;
&#13;
  25.     The NBS has reached satisfactory progress in the implementation of the&#13;
 Supervisory Development Plan in a manner satisfactory to the Association (paragraph 4&#13;
 inSchedule2 o fthe DCA). This conditionhasbeenmet.&#13;
&#13;
  26.    The multi-year Supervisory Development Plan (SDP) was designed to address the&#13;
 overall development and strengthening o f the banking supervision function. With the&#13;
 exception o f one o f the nine agreed `measures' (which is on track - see paragraph 27),&#13;
the N B S has satisfactorily progressed with respect to each measure, including: (1)&#13;
approval and communication to staff o f a supervisory operating procedure; (2) approval&#13;
o f lines o f delegated responsibility; (3) the N B S requirement that banks' boards receive,&#13;
review, respond to, and sign reports o f examination; (5) communication with bank boards&#13;
and management; (6) approval o f an examination manual; (7) adoption of bank rating&#13;
system; (8) plans for a documentary database; and (9) the negotiation o f two M O U s with&#13;
foreign supervisory authorities.&#13;
&#13;
 27.     The most far reaching amongst the nine agreed SDP measures (number 4)&#13;
requires that NBS' bank supervision conduct risk targeted supervisory activities in the&#13;
highest risk institutions, as established in the N B S Supervisory Review Committee&#13;
examination schedule. The NBS recently submitted a more robust analysis and support&#13;
for its planned supervisory activities, which better correlates the banks to their identified&#13;
risks.   As the risk identification protocol to stratify the most vulnerable banks was&#13;
adopted in mid-October, the specific supervisory actions to be taken towards these banks&#13;
are slated to be inplace by year-end.&#13;
&#13;
 28.     The FIU has begun to function in a manner satisfactory to the Association&#13;
(paragraph 5 in Schedule 2 o f the DCA). This conditionhasbeen met.&#13;
&#13;
 29.    The Ministry o f Finance (MOF) established and resourced a new division to&#13;
combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The Administration for the Prevention&#13;
o f Money Laundering (APML) division o f the MOF serves as the Financial Intelligence&#13;
Unit (FIU) or repository o f information from banks, insurance companies and others&#13;
regarding large cash and suspicious transactions.            The APML in tum provides&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 information to the appropriate Serbian and overseas authorities to assist inthe prevention&#13;
  and detection of money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The APML was&#13;
 recently independently evaluated in accordance with international best practice and&#13;
 accepted for membership by the Egmont Group, an international coalition dedicated to&#13;
 fostering the development o f FIUs and the exchange o f information.&#13;
&#13;
  30.    The BRA has appointed theprivatization adviser, satisfactory to the Association,&#13;
for the privatization of Niska Banka (paragraph 6 in Schedule 2 o f the DCA).           This&#13;
 condition hasbeenmet.&#13;
&#13;
  31.    The privatization advisory contract for Niska Banka was executed October 14th&#13;
 2004. Thus, it i s envisaged that Niska Banka may be publicly offered for sale shortly&#13;
 after the new year.&#13;
&#13;
  32.    The BRA has issued a tender, in a manner satisfactory to the Association, for the&#13;
 sale of the Government of the Republic of Serbia's ownership in three banks satisfactory&#13;
 to the Association (paragraph 7 in Schedule 2 o f the DCA).      This condition has been&#13;
 met.&#13;
&#13;
  33.    The BRA, as agent for the Government o f the Republic of Serbia, engaged a&#13;
 reputable investment bank to act as its financial advisor to privatize three majority state-&#13;
 owned banks: JuBanka, Continental and Novosadska banks. JuBanka was offered for&#13;
 sale through open tender in May 2004; eight bidders were short-listed and three&#13;
 indicative bids were received at end-August. Final bids are due in November. The&#13;
 advertisement for the sale o f Continental andNovosadkabanks was published September&#13;
24thinthe FinancialTimes.&#13;
&#13;
  34.    The Government of the Republic of Serbia has approved and begun to implement&#13;
a time-bound actionplan, satisfactory to the Association, for the resolution of the largest&#13;
bank remaining under the bank restructuring program (paragraph 8 in Schedule 2 o f the&#13;
DCA). This conditionhas beenmet.&#13;
&#13;
  35.   As part of its on-going efforts to strengthen governance and controls at this&#13;
systemically important bank, a restructuring advisor was placed on-site at Vojvodjanska&#13;
Banka (VB) and the management team replaced. Then, after extensive consultations, the&#13;
BRA Council, ledbythe Minister ofFinance, MinisterofEconomy andPrivatizationand&#13;
N B S Governor, formally adopted the VB restructuringplan in April 2004. The bank has&#13;
since met or exceeded the agreed restructuring targets. The Government i s committed to&#13;
the sale of VB, as the tender for the selection of a privatization advisor was launched&#13;
October 4th. The September mission re-affirmed with the authorities that the privatization&#13;
advisory contract would be executed by about end-2004. Thereafter, upon undertaking&#13;
its due diligence and upon receipt o f the end-ZOO4 external audit report, a majority stake&#13;
would be offered for sale to a strategic investor via international tender no later than May&#13;
2005. It i s envisaged the bank's sale would be concluded prior to end-2005.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  36.    The Republic of Serbia has enacted a law on insurance satisfactory to the&#13;
 Association (paragraph 9 inSchedule 2 o f the DCA). This conditionhasbeenmet.&#13;
&#13;
  37.    A new Insurance Law became effective May 2gth, 2004. Major reforms include&#13;
 substantially increased sustained minimum capital requirements, restrictions on&#13;
 reinsurance options for local direct insurers, strong controls over intermediaries and a&#13;
 requirement that life and non-life operations have separate licenses. Under the new&#13;
 insurance law, supervision o f insurershas beentransferred to the National Bank o f Serbia&#13;
 (NBS) whilst regulation remains with the MOF. Total supervisory staff now numbers 32,&#13;
 with another 30 or so persons still to be selected.&#13;
&#13;
  38.    The PA has sold through tender, initiated the restructuring proceedings, or&#13;
 initiated bankvuptcy proceedings with respect to at least 35percent of the socially-owned&#13;
 enterprises agreed upon by the Borrower and Association, such actions having been&#13;
conducted in a manner and on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association,&#13;
 including the provision in the offer of sale through tender of a legally binding&#13;
commitment tofinance the applicable severancepaymentsfor all redundant employees of&#13;
such enterprises (paragraph 10 in Schedule 2 o f the DCA).        This condition has been&#13;
met.&#13;
&#13;
  39.    Despite a difficult political environment, the PA has made good progress in the&#13;
tender privatization o f socially-owned enterprises (SOEs). Using technical assistance&#13;
provided by the Bank and bilateral donors, the PA had engaged expert privatization&#13;
advisors for 54 SOEs, organized intwelve pools. As o f October 1, 2004, 23 enterprises&#13;
have been successfully sold, which has more than fulfilled the relevant PFSAC I1&#13;
condition.    Tenders are still ongoing or planned for 14 more enterprises.         Eleven&#13;
enterprises are now undergoingrestructuring prior to beingoffered for sale, and six more&#13;
SOEs have beenmovedto auctions.&#13;
&#13;
 40.    Starting on April 1, 2003, the PA has: (a) offered for sale through auctions, in a&#13;
manner satisfactory to the Association, no less than 560 socially owned enterprises; and&#13;
(b) sold through auctions at least 250 socially-owned enterprises (paragraph 11 in&#13;
Schedule 2 o f the DCA). This conditionhasbeenmet.&#13;
&#13;
 41,    The PA kept up the momentum inthe auctionprivatizationprocess and the targets&#13;
envisioned in PFSAC I1conditionality were surpassed by the end o f December 2003.&#13;
Specifically, 595 enterprises were put for sale in auction between April 1 and December&#13;
31, 2003, and 463 o f them were successfully sold. This year (2004) the auction process&#13;
slowed somewhat from the rapid pace o f 2003, due largely to the declining number and&#13;
quality o f the companies available for auction. In2004, 372 companies were offered or&#13;
expect to be offered for sale, with 227 o f them sold or expected to be sold.&#13;
&#13;
 42.    The PA has offered for sale two socially owned conglomerate enterprises agreed&#13;
upon by the Borrower and Association, or has offered for sale viable parts of such&#13;
enterprises, all in a manner and on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association&#13;
(paragraph 12 in Schedule 2 o fthe DCA). This conditionhas been met.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 43.    Using the technical assistance finding provided by the Bank and other donors&#13;
(USAID, EAR, DFID), the PA engaged teams o f international and local advisors to lead&#13;
the preparation and implementation of privatization through restructuring programs for&#13;
about 30 companies. In particular, using the Bank's TA Credit, the PA has engaged&#13;
financial advisors to work on 12 large SOEs in its portfolio. After initial delays due to&#13;
the difficult Serbian legal and creditor environment, the PA adopted a strategy putting&#13;
more emphasis on conditional sales (subject to debt restructuring after a conditional bid&#13;
offer) and sales o f assets and subsidiaries. As a result o f this approach, a number of&#13;
companies and/or parts thereof have been offered for tender or auction since the start o f&#13;
2004, including three SOEs financed by the Bank (Matroz, Livnica and Sever).        While&#13;
the tender for Matroz failed to attract any bids and the company i s now scheduled for&#13;
bankruptcy, Livnica has been successfully sold in August 2004, and the negotiations are&#13;
currently underway with the winningbidder for Sever.&#13;
&#13;
                                    IV.    Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
 44.   Inview of the overall performance and progress with the implementation of the&#13;
program supported by the Credit, and incompliance with the specific conditions o f release&#13;
as described in Section 2.02 (d), the Bank has informed the Borrower of the availability o f&#13;
the second tranche o f SDR 29.35 million.&#13;
