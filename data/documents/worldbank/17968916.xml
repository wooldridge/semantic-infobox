&#13;
OLIVER:   Harold, let us begin by my asking you to say a bit about              correctly, and began a period of study and meditation and reading all&#13;
&#13;
yourself: How you came to the Bank in the first place: How you                  the things I could about the bank.     I wrote a speech which was not&#13;
&#13;
established the work in the Information Department; and Whatever you            received with cries of joy by the senior staff of the Bank but which&#13;
&#13;
care to say about the history of that operation.                                Gene Black liked.     He didn't give it because it was    thoroughly&#13;
&#13;
GRAVES:   I came to the Bank in 1950.    The immediate occasion for my          revised, but, at any rate, he liked the draft and ao that was fine.&#13;
&#13;
arrival was the tact that I bad gone to a Princeton Alumni Dinner with                  In September, the Bank bad its Annual Meeting in London.       (Just as&#13;
&#13;
Richard Demuth who then, as later, was in the inner circle of the               a footnote, this was a meeting which Bob Garner declined to attend,&#13;
&#13;
management of the Bank.   I had at that time written a    ~ouple    of pieces   because he felt the British at that time had a Communist Government,&#13;
&#13;
for The Reporter Magazine.    1 was a Washington correspondent for a            and be wasn't going to have any part of that.)     The people who went to&#13;
&#13;
Rhode Island newspaper. but I had written a couple of pieces for         Th~    this meeting went in various waysi but, at this time, air travel across&#13;
&#13;
Reporter Magazine which Dick had read and liked.                                the Atlantic was still fairly rare, and a lot of people went by ship.&#13;
&#13;
     I had known Dick since 1940. but at any rate at this dinner in                     Among the people who went by ship was my predecessor, a man named&#13;
&#13;
1950, which Dick and I attended together, he said,     Â·~ould   you be          Ayres, Bill Ayres.    And on his way to this meeting, Bill Ayres had a&#13;
&#13;
interested in coming to the Bank and writing speeches for the President         heart attack and was taken off the ship.    He was rushed to a hospital&#13;
&#13;
and working on the Annual Report1"      These were two things which Dick        of some kind on the south coast of England and stayed there for a time&#13;
&#13;
himselt had been doing very largely single-hsndedly -- certainly on the         until he was ready to be moved, and he came back to the United States&#13;
&#13;
speech side.   I said, "Yes, that it would interest me." He said, "Well,        only to die, 1 think in October of 1950.    Ayres had been brought into&#13;
&#13;
come down to the Bank and let us talk about it."      So I talked               the Bank out of the financial reporting community.       He understood the&#13;
&#13;
especially with Robert Garner. but I also met Black. and I met some of          financial market, had worked for financial publications, and had&#13;
&#13;
tlw department heads of the Bank. They decided that this was a good             brought something to the Bank which Black felt it needed. It needed&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
contact with the financial community.   It needed a publications effort&#13;
                                                                               character in the early history of the Bank, Walter Hill -- another&#13;
which would be directed very strongly at the financial community and at&#13;
                                                                               fellow that the Bank didn't know what to do with, so he was shipped off&#13;
the sale of the Bank's bonds.&#13;
                                                                               to the Paris office too.      One of the early things that I was told&#13;
     At any rate, after a period of mourning, shall we say, 1 vas&#13;
                                                                               specifically, was, "You'd better look at Dudley'' and, in effect, decide&#13;
appointed to succeed Bill Ayres late in November in 1950.   And my&#13;
                                                                               to get rid of him.     I went to Paris and discovered, quite to the&#13;
not my formal instruction so much as the obvious state of affairs made&#13;
                                                                               contrary of the impressions the management had, Drew was really doing a&#13;
it clear that my directive was to establish or to strengthen the Bank's&#13;
                                                                               terrific job for the Bank in Europe.      So I declined to fire him, and&#13;
acquaintance particularly in the financial community or in those&#13;
                                                                               that decision was reluctantly accepted -- especially by Garner who had&#13;
sections of the press which were read by people who were buying&#13;
                                                                               no particular use for Dudley. At any rate, what I am saying is that the&#13;
securities such as World Bank bonds.    Bill Ayres hiaaelf bad not been&#13;
                                                                               indicated line of activity for me was very much the financial realm.         I&#13;
in the Bank for a long time at that point.    I can't tell you how long&#13;
                                                                               obviously didn't know anything about finance either, but I had some&#13;
he had been in the Bank.&#13;
                                                                               facility for    writing, and 1 did, I think, take a big load off Demuth's&#13;
     His predecessor was a man called Drew Dudley, and Drew had been&#13;
                                                                               shoulders.&#13;
appointed the first Director of Information of the Bank by Eugene&#13;
                                                                                    I did have a very indispensable aid in the presence on the&#13;
Meyer.   Drew was a very charming, socially adroit, nice kind of person&#13;
                                                                               information staff of William Bennett, who had been a principal&#13;
who knew Meyer socially.   Drew was a sort of s proteg~ of Blanche&#13;
                                                                               financial reporter for the New York Herald Tribune. who knew the whole&#13;
Knopf, the wife of Alfred Knopf, the New York publisher.    I think he&#13;
                                                                               scene very well, and who patiently indoctrinated me in the whole&#13;
came into the Bank by that route.   When Drew protested that he didn't&#13;
                                                                               subject.     So the Bank 1 s public relations -- incidentally. the&#13;
know anything about financial matters, Eugene Heyer said, according to&#13;
                                                                               department at that time was known as the Public Relations Department.&#13;
Drew, "That's all right; if you can come to understand the Bank, then&#13;
                                                                               It had suffered or experienced several changes of names.       Later on it&#13;
anyone can be made to understand the Bank."    That was Drew'a way of&#13;
                                                                               became an Office instead of a Department and it became Information&#13;
putting it.&#13;
                                                                               instead of Public Relations.&#13;
   But, at any rate, Drew didn't know the financial aide of things,&#13;
                                                                                    At any rate. this was a fairly narrow assignment, except that it&#13;
and, for some reason or other, he didn't appeal very much to Black.       So&#13;
                                                                               extended outside of the United States and included Western Europe as&#13;
Drew wus posted off to the Paris Office along with another famous&#13;
                                                                               well as New York and Chicago.      It also. to my mind, meant that we had&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                                6&#13;

to have something more than financial public relations: we had to have.&#13;

to Williamsburg, we went to the Princeton Inn. and it was all very nice                frequently-- bringing some person to lunch with the upper staff of the&#13;

letting ideas circulate, clarifying what we thought about various                      and try to learn something from him.         Well. Gene went through one of&#13;

be really did have an interest in this. and I had better damn well do                  we had a very good piece in Fortune Magazine written by a fells. I&#13;

something about it.                                                                    think. named Richard Austin Smith.         But at any rate. this was part of a&#13;

&#13;
noted for their fierce independence or their unassailable editorial                    anguish.    We were shown this piece before it was published. and this&#13;
&#13;
integrity.        They were fish in a barrel. more or less.          All we needed     really became the biggest thing in my life -- to try to get this thing&#13;
&#13;
was to go after them and show them a little human kindness and treat                   out of the text.       Gene said. "This is terrible.     People were kind to&#13;
&#13;
them with some intelligence and respect.               Fortune and these other         me.   They asked me in. and here I said this terrible thing about them."&#13;

tbinr..s were another matter.            Anyway. we brought Drew back. and I armed     So I worked very hard on that and a number of other things in the&#13;

OLIVER:    What year was the article?                                          that made my peace with the management. and the problem of the public&#13;
&#13;
GRAVES:     I think it was 1956.   Anyway that happened. and then. not too     relations effort did not get to be a problem again. until about a half&#13;
long after that. Gene was on the cover of    !i!!   magazine and Newsweek      a dozen years later in the Woods administration.     Shall I go on and&#13;
magazine. as often happens in the same week.     And that was about as far     talk about that7 or do you want to cover that in the fullness of time?&#13;
as one could go with this line of endeavor. I should say; and I am             OLIVER:   Well. I'm fascinated by what you're telling me about your&#13;
taking a lot of time I think in the wrong era. but the management got          early years in the Bank.   You might say a bit about how the Information&#13;
so discouraged about public relations that they appointed a consultant.        Department expanded. and what effect. if any. there was on the&#13;
G. Edward Pendray. to come in and take a look at the public relations          Department with the change of administration fro. Eugene Black to&#13;
of the Bank.    This was useful. because Bob Garner was a man who bated        George Woods.&#13;
&#13;
to spend a nickel.     Basically Bob's view of public relation or              GRAVES:   It was a very small department to begin with:    three or four&#13;
&#13;
information or whatever was that. Well. you had to do this. but you            people.   As a result of this Pendray exercise. the management&#13;
&#13;
really shouldn't waste much time or spend any money on this. and Bob.          asked me to write my evaluation of the problem and so on. which I did;&#13;
&#13;
as you recall. controlled the budget of the Bank and decided how the           and at that time. we expanded the department. if you can use that term&#13;
&#13;
money was going to be spent on the administrative side.         So this is     for a pretty modest evolution.   I think we built the staff from four to&#13;
&#13;
part of the atmosphere in which the information effort was carried on.         seven. five to eight. something on that order.     And. for the first&#13;
        Well. bringing in this consultant was a useful thing. because it did   time. I had a Deputy Director of Information.&#13;
finally convey to Garner the idea that you really should do something               We got formal approval for some things that we wanted done with&#13;
in this realm. and you really should be willing to spend some money on         the grudging consent of Hr. Garner.   We had a speaking program which&#13;
this.     The Pendray report was. I thought. partly good and partly bad.       Garner thought. â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢   Some of it interested him.    If we could talk to&#13;
It pointed out that the Bank didn't really have an adequate publications       a group of the Investment Bankers Association of Phoenix Arizona. he&#13;
program in the sense that having a line of publications that were              was all for that.   He didn't see much point in talking to a local&#13;
building up faithful audiences. and so on.      In other respects. it was      committee of the Council on Foreign Relations in Augusta. Georgia.&#13;
&#13;
sort of dumb.     I'm sure the consultants had written this same report        Well. we were doing both of these things to the extent that we could&#13;
&#13;
for other clients. and they had just sort of put the Bank's name in the        partly because we wanted to reach some of these people. but partly&#13;
&#13;
proper paragraphs.     On the whole. it was a not unuseful exercise.     So    also. I must say. because we thought it wss good for the staff to get&#13;

they did know and thought about the Bank.               We were doing this in the U.&#13;

s.    We then proposed, and to a certain extent succeeded, to adopt a&#13;

program which would carry this kind of effort further in Europe. and so&#13;

        When Woods came in -- 1 had met Woods and be had met me, and I&#13;
                                                                                         and forth through the corridors of the Sheraton Hotel with new jumbo&#13;

furniture in the Bank.             I was important to   h~,   again in the speech&#13;

GRAVES:     Mr. Black tinkered almost not at all.      Gene bad an inferiority     scale; and then we wrote all this stuff down in a big policy manual,&#13;

he need have been, although he was not a great speaker.            But his whole   extemporaneously   as he must have been at this Fortune magazine lunch&#13;

&#13;
big audience.            Gene was very good at extemporaneous things.              Woods was         as long footnotes for the benefit of the people who were not in the&#13;

a much better speaker on formal occasions than Black was.                         He was very        room.     There were two versions of every McNamaraâ&#128;¢ s speech.     1'here was&#13;
&#13;
effective extemporaneously.                     He bsd a very colorful flow of speech.          It   the published version. and then there was the version that was read.&#13;
&#13;
was a New York color rather than an Atlanta color.                                                   There wasn 1 t enough time to give the whole text. so he only read&#13;

GRAVES:       Well. the accent. perhaps; but it was a very casual. jazzy                             OLIVER: Well. you referred in passing to William Clark and to changes&#13;
&#13;
kind of       monologue compared to what we 1 d been used to.                 He had these           in the Information Department that put you in Siberia.         I wonder if you&#13;

situation myself. and. in that last summer. I was interested in a&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER:     Be was a close friend of Barbara Ward already?                      that a person who was doing the 8peechea (who was McKitterick) ought to&#13;
&#13;
GRAVES:     Yea. ob yea.                                                        have the benefit of that experience.     So. for example, Hac went on a&#13;

OLIVER:     So Hr. Woods bad probably met Mr. Clark through â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢             long trip into Africa with Gene toward the end of Gene's period in the&#13;

GRAVES:     I'm not sure.     Ob yes. sure; he bad talked to Mr. Clark about    Bank.&#13;
&#13;
the Grand Assize. I'm sure.                                                             I did some very interesting things with Gene.   I went with Gene to&#13;

OLIVER:     Then Clark stayed on as Director of Information under Hr.           Southeast Aaia at a tt.e when the final negotiations leading up to the&#13;
&#13;
McNamara and, I guess. accompanied Mr. McH..ara on trips and that sort          INDUS aediatioo were in progress.     I watched that.   I went with Gene to&#13;

of~-.                                                                           Cairo when he went there to try to adjudicate the problema of the&#13;

GRAVES:     Oh yea.   Be was chosen by Woods in fact to be the Director of      claims against the Egyptian government arising out of the sequestration&#13;
&#13;
Information.     He got another and higher title, as it happened. to serve      by the Egyptian Government of British properties at the time of the&#13;
&#13;
under McNamara.       I don't think Woods felt that Clark was going to be       Suez Canal incident.&#13;
&#13;
his (Woods;} Director.        This was something be was going to hand to        OLIVER:    That was an incident in which Hr. Woods was involved, wasn't&#13;
&#13;
McNamara.                                                                       it?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     You have no idea if he checked with McNamara on that subject?       GRAVES:    Well, bia involvement was a bit later and came in the â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
GRAVES:     I really don;t.     Although, I do know, or I think I know, that    Well, to talk about Woods involvement in some things that happened&#13;
&#13;
McNamara, after a short time, was very happy with William Clark.           Be   during Black;&amp; presidency: the first thing (that I was aware of at any&#13;
&#13;
thought this was great, and he was especially grateful to Woods for             rate} waa the Bank;&amp; financing of the private manufacture of steel in&#13;
&#13;
having made this choice in his appointment.                                     India.    There were two private companies in India.    In fact, two of the&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Did you travel with Mr. Black, for example, or Mr. Woods to         private companies were Indian Iron and Steel Company and the Steel&#13;
&#13;
the same extent that Hr. Clark traveled with Mr. McNamara?                      Company of Bengal, and theae had adjacent facilities; they had&#13;
&#13;
GRAVES:     No. I travelled somewhat with Gene, very little with Wooda.         partially interlocking directorateâ&#128;¢, and so on.     From various points of&#13;
&#13;
McKitterick travelled with Woods at my behest.        In fact, be travelled     vie~. it . . de sense to merge these companies instead of continuing to&#13;
&#13;
with Black at my behest, because my experience with Black bad been that         operate the. as separate entities, and Black recruited Woods to&#13;
&#13;
you learned an awful lot travelling with the President of the World             accomplish this merger 1 which he did.    This involved not only&#13;
&#13;
Bank and watching him deal with tasks in the field; and it seemed to me         negotiations with management but especially with stockholders and so&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          23                                                                              24&#13;

on.     So George did this for Black.                                         OLIVER:    You liked them a lot.&#13;
&#13;
        The sequel to the Suez Canal incident was the expropriation of the    GBAVES: They were not without incident.      I will never forget:        One&#13;
&#13;
      well, the thing that started it all off was the expropriation of the    thing we did, which waa not known in British circles at the time, was&#13;
&#13;
Suez Canal Company.     Part of what Gene worked out with the Egyptian        to have cocktails before lunch.      The British Presâ&#128;¢ vas a very much&#13;
&#13;
government was to try to regularize relations between the Egyptian            leas respected institution than the American Preas and not pampered at&#13;
&#13;
Government and the     West, especially the financial community in the        all the way      the American Preas ia pampered.   This business of having&#13;
&#13;
West, to find something for the canal company to do and also some             cocktails before lunch was unknown but greatly appreciated by the City&#13;
&#13;
appropriate compensation for the company.     Well Woods handled that for     editors.     Well, some of the City editors liked the cocktails better&#13;
&#13;
Black.     There are other things no doubt that be did.   Those are the two   than they liked the lunch, I guess.&#13;
&#13;
that I remember.                                                                  At one of these lunches, the senior editor waa a dear little man&#13;

OLIVER:     I think I interrupted you when you were telling your own story    named Norman Crump, who was the City editor        of~~~.                      We&#13;
&#13;
about Suez and Egypt.     Were there other occasions when you were with       eat down at the table, and we ate a little, and Gene     ~de     a few&#13;

Black that you wanted.                                                        spontaneous remarks as be always did.      Then came time for questions,&#13;
&#13;
GRAVES:     I travelled with him.   I went to Hew York with him quite         and since Norman Crump was the senior editor present, be was recognized&#13;
&#13;
often. One thing that he predictably liked to do, aod which I must say        for the purpose of asking the first question.       Norman, who bad had a&#13;
&#13;
I particularly liked to do, be liked to lunch with the financial press        few. succeeded in uttering his question and then he put his face down&#13;
in London, when be happened to be in London-- called the City Preas:          in hia plate, which was not yet entirely empty of nourishment, and went&#13;
&#13;
The City in London. Gene enjoyed that enormously, because the City            aound asleep.     At any rate, this does lead --and I'll dignify this&#13;

editors were a very interesting and well informed group of people, aucb       story by â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
more so than any group that you could put together out uf the New York        OLIVER:    I just have to interrupt to say that it is not surprising that&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                          25                                                                         26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
vestiges of that when I came in, which eeemed to me to be tedious for        without having to explain them, even to members of the staff.     We used&#13;
everybody, because the President of the Bank didn't always have              to have inforaation conferences with the press, and Gene would not let&#13;
something to say and the press vas not always interested in what he bad      the transcripts of those conferences be circulated in the Bank.     That&#13;
to say. So we adopted the practice of scheduling press conferences when      was his buainess with the press, and that's where that rested.     Woods&#13;
&#13;
we thought there vas something to be said, and even more of having           was even more reticent about making policy decisions and explaining why&#13;
informal lunches with Black at tiaea when there wasn't any occasion at       he made them.   He talked a great deal, but there were subjects on which&#13;
all, just for the purpose of getting the press acquainted with Black         he was utterly silent or very reticent.   This vae one difficulty that&#13;
and getting him acquainted with them and letting them develop anything       the staff bad with Woods:   be did not really explain himself adequately&#13;
they had on their minds.                                                     on many occasions.   This vas it, and that vas that.&#13;
     Despite his later concern   wit~   his problema in the public opinion   OLIVER:   Well, thank you for this first aession of taping.   It's been a&#13;
field, Woods was nowhere near aa conscious of the press or concerned         fascinating story, and we will do one aore.&#13;
&#13;
with the press.   It was difficult to get him to do press conferences,&#13;
&#13;
and there were sooe subjects on which be absolutely refused to talk.&#13;
&#13;
When the Bank's relations with India became very strained and very&#13;
delicate, Woods absolutely refused to see the press at any time,&#13;
&#13;
because he didn't want to face the possible embarrassment of questions&#13;
&#13;
about India.   And he especially refused to see the members of the&#13;
&#13;
Indian Preas, who were individually very friendly with the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
might have been quite helpful in this situation.     Actually be refused&#13;
&#13;
to see them.   Gene, more and more, got to know the press and to value&#13;
&#13;
what the press could do for him.    Woods did not.    He liked reporters&#13;
&#13;
well enough, individually, but he didn't really care for the Preas, or&#13;
&#13;
The Preas Corps, as institutions.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   He was, perhaps, not as outgoing a personality as Hr. Black.&#13;
&#13;
GRAVES:   That's right.    Gene wanted to have the right to make decisions&#13;
