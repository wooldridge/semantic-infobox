        <abstracts>
            In response to the financial crisis in
            developed countries, the G-20, the financial stability
            board, the Basel committee on banking supervision, and other
            standard setters are pursuing an agenda of reforms aimed at
            improving laws, policies, and procedures for resolving
            troubled and failing financial institutions. These reforms
            offer concepts that deserve attention in the developing
            world, particularly for dealing with the systemically
            important banks and other financial firms that are a feature
            in nearly every country.
