the subsidy, and the budgetary requirements. However, the lack of consistent and reliable data sets&#13;
which combine socioeconomic and water consumption information may be an important obstacle to&#13;
making good decisions, undermining efforts to provide affordable water services for the poor. This&#13;

shortcomings in the data. To illustrate, the Note draws on data from World Bank work in Panama.&#13;

            In developing countries the provision of
            water and sanitation services is often subsidized. These
            subsidies take the form of a general underpricing of water,
            numerous cross-subsidies, and inefficient billing and
            collection. An essential part of infrastructure reform is
            the redesign of subsidies. In the design of an optimal
            subsidy scheme the key decisions are the choice of
            eligibility criteria, the level of the subsidy and the
            budgetary requirements. However, the lack of consistent and
            reliable data sets which combine socioeconomic and water
            consumption information may be an important obstacle to
            making good decisions, undermining efforts to provide
            affordable water services for the poor. This Note discusses
            the type of information required, where it can be found, and
            ways to deal with shortcomings in the data. To illustrate,
            the Note draws on data from World Bank work in Panama.
