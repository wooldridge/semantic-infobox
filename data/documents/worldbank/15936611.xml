        loan 	aspects.&#13;
                MR. DORR:   Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, this proposed loanl,&#13;
II                                                                         !&#13;

         is 	to finance one of the steel projects which were submitted&#13;
         to 	the Bank, one of a number of steel projects which were&#13;
:' 	 submitted to the Bank by Japan in August of 1954.         I might&#13;
         just say parenthetically that two of those projects have&#13;
         since been withdrawn, two others are under consideration, and        i&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         one is before you today.&#13;
              This one, as is indicated in the preSident's report, is&#13;
         for modernization of a plate mill and facilities at the&#13;
         Yawata Steel Company in the Island of Kyushu, Japan.&#13;
              I might just say a word about the economic setting and&#13;
ii&#13;
    I	&#13;
         background.   When you considered the three thermal power&#13;
         loans in October 1953, Japan was 1n a somewhat difficult&#13;
         position economically.     There was a considerable degree of&#13;
         inflation.    She was having balance of payments difficulties.&#13;
&#13;
!i&#13;
         It was recognized that there was a really serious problem.&#13;
;:&#13;
    ,&#13;
!! 	 On the other hand, it was felt that Japan would be able to&#13;
:i&#13;
i;&#13;
"	 improve her situation.&#13;
I:&#13;
                                    I am happy to say that in the two&#13;
ii&#13;
"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'I       years which have passed Since that time Japan has made a&#13;
Ii&#13;
"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I:&#13;
II rather remarkable sain on the economic side.           I think perhaps&#13;
II&#13;
Ii       one single point which has come up Since this report was made&#13;
Ii&#13;
i\ 	&#13;
I: emphasizes it more dramatically than anything else.          The&#13;
i~&#13;
I'&#13;
         Minister of Finance of Japan has recently reported that for&#13;
         the first six months of Japan's fiscal 1955, that is, from&#13;
         April 1955 through September, Japan had a balance of' payments&#13;
    , 	 surplus of' $233 million.    The particularly important part,&#13;
"&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        13&#13;
       however, is that she bad a surplus in her visible trade of&#13;
       $26 million.   Compare that with the situation in 1953, when&#13;
       she bad a deficit in her visible trade of nearly $1 billion.&#13;
            This improvement bas been achieved largely by a buildup&#13;
       in Japants exports.    There bas also been some reduction in&#13;
       her imports.   I wontt go into a long discussion of how this&#13;
       bas been achieved.     It is through a combination of factors.&#13;
       Internal monetary policy has been applied with considerable&#13;
       skill and considerable resolution, which I think has played&#13;
 i	    an important part.     Also important, ot course, has been the&#13;
       higb level of economic activity in the world at large, and&#13;
       the fact that a number of important trading nations have&#13;
ii 	   taken steps to make it more possible for Japan to trade at a&#13;
il&#13;
':&#13;
&#13;
       higher level and to have removed some of the discriminations&#13;
       a~inst   Japanese trade which formerly existed.&#13;
            Obviously, there are still many uncertainties as to&#13;
       Japan ts Position.    There is no getting away trom the tact&#13;
       that she is overcrowded, tbat the population problem is still&#13;
       a serious one, even though there has been some improvement&#13;
       in the rate ot increase in the population.     I mean there&#13;
       bas been some reduction in the rate.     Japan will continue to&#13;
;1     be extremely vulnerable to shirts and changes in economic&#13;
:; 	 activity in other countries, and it there were major changes&#13;
       that migbt change her position very seriously, very quickly.&#13;
            The question ot access to foreign markets will always be 
&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   14&#13;
&#13;
i a difficult one, I think, because Japan, as her population&#13;
     increases, obviously will have to keep expanding her foreign&#13;
     trade, and that in turn will put pressure upon other&#13;
     countries, and there will always be a matter of adjustmento&#13;
          Finally, there are still outstanding large unsettled&#13;
     reparation claims, and occupation expense claims by the U. S. I&#13;
     Government.   There has been some progress in settling repara-     I&#13;
     t10n claims and a settlement With Burma, but the lrgest cla1msi&#13;
                                                                    I&#13;
     are still outstanding and unsettled.                           I&#13;
          This particular project, the Yawata steel project, is to I&#13;
                                                                        I&#13;
     aid in the modernization of the Japanese steel industry.&#13;
                                                                        I&#13;
     I don.t think any extended dissertation on the importance&#13;
     of that industry is necessary.   Japan, as you know, is a&#13;
     highly industrialized nation, and the steel industry is&#13;
     therefore, by definition, basic and essential.    It has played    I&#13;
     and is playing an extremely important part in Japan's exte rna 11&#13;
 1   trade and her ability to earn her living abroad, as well as        I&#13;
                                                                        I&#13;
     in the domestic economy.   The material which is provided for      I&#13;
                                                                        1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'I&#13;
&#13;
 1   Japan's variOUS machinery and transportation equipment&#13;
     industries is, of course, vital to that trade, from which she&#13;
;' earned about 12-1/2 percent of her foreign earnings last yearol&#13;
          The Yawata Steel Company is the oldest and largest            I&#13;
 : steel enterprise in Japan.     The original company was the&#13;
ii&#13;
i;   first one to build the steel mill, and the organization today&#13;
:1&#13;
:1&#13;
:: employes about 35,000 people.      It has assets of over $280&#13;
!!&#13;
I'&#13;
&#13;
i:&#13;
!:&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                            15&#13;
        million.   The company has been carrying forward a very active&#13;
        modernization program since it was reconstituted under the&#13;
        occupation, and has spent about $73 million since 1951.           This&#13;
    I   project would carry forward that modernization.        It would&#13;
        specifically replace three outmoded plate rolling mills, one&#13;
        of which goes back to 1905 and the newest of which was&#13;
        installed in 1928.    The savings, assuming an operating rate&#13;
        of 83 percent, would be over $3 million a year.        I would&#13;
        emphasize that this is a replacement rather than an expansion&#13;
        of capacity.    There is   8   small expansion, but the main point&#13;
I       is replacement.&#13;
             In regard to the loan features, the basic outline is&#13;
        about the same as that of the three thermal power loans.           The&#13;
        Japanese Government has asked that the loan be made to The&#13;
I! 	    Japan Development Bank as its chosen instrument for long-term&#13;
        financing of priority industrial projects.        The loan, of&#13;
        course, would be guaranteed as to payment by the Japanese&#13;
        Government.    The funds would be reloaned by The Japan&#13;
    I   Development Bank to the Yawata Steel Company.        The Yawata&#13;
    I   Steel Company would enter into direct contractual relations&#13;
        with the bank through a project agreement.&#13;
             I think the main noteworthy feature in regard to&#13;
        relations between Yawata and the Bank is that Yawata would&#13;
        undertake to make certain improvements in its financial&#13;
        structure.     Necessarily, during and after the war there was a 
&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                          16&#13;
     great deal of wear and tear on Yawatals plant.         A lot of it&#13;
     became obsolete.     As I have mentioned, it was necessary to&#13;
     engage in a very large modernization program.        Due to the&#13;
     shortage of capital and the difficulties in rebuilding&#13;
     tmmediate1y after the war, a lot of this had to be financed&#13;
     through nominally short-term bank loans, and on the face of&#13;
     it Yawata has very heavy short-term liabilities and very&#13;
                                                                               I&#13;
     heavy responsibilities for continued refinancing.         The company \&#13;
     itself is well aware of the undesirability of this.           It          i&#13;
&#13;
     estimates that now    ~hat   the modernization   pro~    is               I&#13;
     practically completed that it will be sufficient so that in               I&#13;
     the years to come it will be able to get to a more liquid                 1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     position and get to a position where the equity bears a&#13;
     rather better relation to debt than it does now.         It would&#13;
     give satisfactory assurances to the Bank that it would pursue&#13;
     policies over the period of the next ten years calculated to&#13;
     produce a much sounder structure than exists today.&#13;
          I think those are the main features.         I believe that&#13;

          THE CHAIRMAN:     Thank you very much.      Mr. McDiarmid.&#13;
          MR. McDIARMID:     Mr. Cha1rman and gentlemen, the Economic&#13;
     Report accompanying this proposal outlines the economiC and&#13;
     financial developments in Japan in 1954 and the first half of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                          17&#13;
:: 1955.           It also summarized the conclusions of the previous&#13;
         economic report on Japan that was completed in June of 1953,&#13;
         and indicates certain reasons ror a more optimistic appraisal&#13;
         ot Japan's prospects than could be made at that time.&#13;
             The continuing baSic economic problems of Japan, such&#13;
         as distance from markets and sources or supp17, population,&#13;
         limited resources, et    cet~ra,   and uncertainties in respect to&#13;
         the continuance or the present favorable external economic&#13;
         trends and the extent ot eventual reparations and other&#13;
         postwar obligations, suggest the suspension ot judgment at&#13;
         this time as to whether Japan will come closer to sell-support&#13;
         without special toreign exchange receipts during the next&#13;
!	       tew 7ears than was previous17 estimated.       In the preVious&#13;
    :	&#13;
:j&#13;
.1&#13;
         reports 70U m87 recall a residual trade deticit ot about&#13;
j        $300 million to $400 million a 7ear was Visualized as&#13;
I: 	&#13;
"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         continuing in 1957, and it was telt that this would have to&#13;
         be covered either b7 special U. S. expenditures or b7 some&#13;
Ii       other means.    The trade deficit was actual17 reduced to about&#13;
         this level or near17 to this level in 1954, that is, slightl7&#13;
         over $400 million, and will apparent17 be well below it in&#13;
         1955.&#13;
                 In addition to action taken within Japan, some reduction&#13;
         in import restrictIons in Japanese goods abroad and in some&#13;
         cases increasing economic activit7 in her principal foreign&#13;
         markets have been of great assistance in enabling her to 
&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                           18&#13;
         expand her exports on a well diversified basis.       The&#13;
         continuance of favorable conditions outside Japan will be&#13;
         essential for her to consolidate and increase the      ~ins    which&#13;
         she has made in the last eighteen months.   The decline in&#13;
         special receipts from U. S. procurement and the forces&#13;
                                                           I&#13;
&#13;
         expenditures in Japan, and the uncertainty in respect to&#13;
         future amounts of these receipts, also make it difficult to&#13;
         predict the extent to which Japan will have extraordinary&#13;
         ba1anoe of payments assistance to sustain her eoonomy while&#13;
         she is still working towards a more self-supporting position.&#13;
              Developments over the last year and a half were&#13;
         generally favorable.   The features of greatest signifioance&#13;
         I think are, first, it has been demonstrated that output is&#13;
         now at a sufficient level in the economy so that, given&#13;
         reasonably favorable external oiroumstances and satisfactory&#13;
         harvest, the economy has adequate flexibility so that internal&#13;
         monetary measures can be effective in correcting large&#13;
    ,	&#13;
"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
;j       imbalances in foreign trade.   The heavy trade defioit of&#13;
         nearly $1 billion in 1953 was more than cut in half between&#13;
i! 	 1953 and 1954, and despite some probably inorease in imports&#13;
&#13;
         during the next few months a further reduction of about 50&#13;
         percent, in other words, to about not more than $200 million,&#13;
    I    may prObably be envisaged between 1954 and 1955.       These&#13;
I&#13;
I	&#13;
         improvements resulted mostly from increases in exports.&#13;
II&#13;
II&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Ii During the first six months of 1955, Japanese exports were&#13;

II&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 19 
&#13;
106 percent higher than in corresponding periods of 1954 and&#13;
1953.     Meanwhile 1 imports have been relatively stable.   During.&#13;
the six months just ended, that is, ending September 30&#13;
this includes material that we did not have when we prepared&#13;
the report -- there was an 1mprovement on trade account of&#13;
about $200 mil11on, as compared w1th the sim1lar per10d 1n&#13;
1954.     At the same time, however, there was a reduction in&#13;
inv1s1ble rece1pts of about $100 mil110n.      In other words,&#13;
on balance the Japanese trade pos1tion improved about&#13;
$100 m1llion between the first six months of the fiscal year&#13;
1955 as compared with the first six months of the prev10us&#13;
fiscal year.     A balance of payments surplus of $144 million&#13;
was realized dur1ng this s1x-month per10d from April to&#13;
September of this year.     This was made up of a trade deficit&#13;
of $63 m1ll1on and 1nvis1ble surplus of $207 million for that           1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
per1od.     Thus, Japan has been able in recent months at least&#13;
                                                                        I&#13;

though they bave been somewhat tightened, I th1nk have been&#13;
of considerable less importance than the 1nd1rect controls&#13;
through monetary means.     I think the use of monetary rather 
&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  20&#13;
&#13;
     than direct controls for the reduction of import surplus may&#13;
     indicate a greater permanence in stability in the improvement&#13;
&#13;
     achieved.&#13;
          In 1954, part of the improvement in the foreign balance&#13;
     had a counterpart in some reduction in the expansion of&#13;
                                                                       i&#13;
     consumption in Japan and a lower level of internal investment,:&#13;
     that is, the improvement in the foreign balance can be&#13;
;1&#13;
&#13;
j!&#13;
     attributed in substantial part to particularly reduced urban&#13;
     consumption and in a lower level of internal investment.&#13;
     The lower level of investment, of course, was principally&#13;
, in a draw-down of inventories, although to some extent there&#13;
:&#13;
i: was also a reduotion in the rate of physical capital formation&#13;
I&#13;
,: in plant and equipment.    That was true of 1954.   In 1955,&#13;
I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     however, the further improvement that has been achieved seems&#13;
I, to have been largely due to increased prOduction, resulting&#13;
&#13;
i: 	 of course in increased exports. This also, I think, augurs&#13;
     for a more permanent improvement than perhaps one could have&#13;

     principal retarding effects on economic activity appear to&#13;
     have been temporary.   At least the volume of unemployment&#13;
     has been reducing in recent months, and at the present time&#13;
     the indicators of industrial activity in Japan are some 80&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     21 
&#13;
    percent above the base, that is the 1934-36 period, and in&#13;
    fact are just about up to the peak wartime Production in 1944.&#13;
         The level of real income has been increasing, although&#13;
    more slowly than in 1953, for example, when a rather Phenomenai&#13;
                                                                            !&#13;

    increase in real income occurred.     At the present time the reai&#13;
    income in Japan is about 106 percent or a little more above&#13;
    the prewar level.&#13;
         I think that is all, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
         THE CllAIRMAN:   Thank you.   Mr. Lipkow1tz.&#13;
         MR. LIPKOWITZ:    Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, before I&#13;
    comment on the project I would like to call your attention to&#13;
    a minor typographical error in the project agreement, which&#13;
    says that the capaCity of the mill is 360 tons, when it                 I&#13;
    should have been 360,000 tons.     We caught that in the printed        I&#13;
                                                                            I&#13;
    copy, so that we won't have any trouble with that, I hope.              I&#13;
         The project before you is more fully described in tbe              I&#13;
    technical report.     It is for the replacement of three presentl&#13;
    operating but obsolete plate mills, with a single new plate&#13;
                                                                        lI&#13;
'mill.     This mill w111 be part of tbelll:wata steel works, whicb         I&#13;
    are the largest steel works in the Far East.        The Yawata          I&#13;
                                                                            !&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
!   company and its predecessors have been ensaged in the steel 
&#13;
    bUSiness for over fifty years.     It has a capable and 
&#13;
    experienced management and has in recent years entered into 
&#13;
    arrangements for technical assistance with a number of 
&#13;
    American steel producing firms, notably    A~co,     to overcome the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      22&#13;
&#13;
       technological lag arising out of the events of 1937 to 1950.&#13;
            During 1954, Yawata produced almost 2,000,000 tons of&#13;
       ingot steel, accounting for about 25 percent of Japanese&#13;
       production.   It had total sales of almost $200 million, and&#13;
       total assets ot almost $300 million equivalent.   Since Korea&#13;
L this company has had underway a vast modernization program.&#13;
,&#13;
&#13;
       In the last tour years it has made gross investments of about&#13;
i&#13;
i,&#13;
       $80 million equivalent, and expects to invest about $35 millio&#13;
       more in the next two years.   The largest single part of this&#13;
I; 	 $35 million program is an expend iture of slightly over&#13;
       $15 million for the plate mill, for which the Bank is being&#13;
       asked to proVide foreign exchange financing of $5.3 million.&#13;
Ij 	   Future investment expenditures after 1957 are expected to&#13;
       be more modest and financible by internal cash generation.&#13;
            In its modernization program to date, Yawata has improved&#13;
       and enlarged its facilities for producing coke, Pig iron,&#13;
       and steel ingots.   Some finishing facilities have also been&#13;
       added, for example, a new electrolytic tin plate mill and a&#13;
       new wire rod mill at a new location, whose constructiQn is&#13;
       close to completion, whereas the earlier emphasis by Yawata&#13;
       and most other Japanese steel companies has been on improVing&#13;
       facilities for baSic steel production.   The current emphasis&#13;
       is largely on modernization of finishing facilities, such as&#13;
       the plate mill.&#13;
            The plate mill project is essentially a replacement&#13;

&#13;
         project, as Mr. Dorr indicated.     The capacity of the new&#13;
         mill will be 360,000 tons per year, or only about 5 percent&#13;
         more than the capacity of the three existing obsolete mills.&#13;
         The new mill should make possible a higher and more unifor.m&#13;
         quality product, at a cost saving of about 10 percent, or&#13;
         approximately $10 per ton.   These savings are equal to about&#13;
         20 percent of the estimated total investment, which leaves&#13;
         some margin for price reductions.     Such reductions may occur&#13;
         because plate prices today are sharply higher than they were&#13;
,I 	     a year ago, not only in Japan but also in Europe, and to a&#13;
         somewhat lower extent in the USA.     Parenthetically, you may&#13;
         ha ve teen in the papers in the last few days that two of the        1\ 
&#13;
         smaller steel mills in the United States have raised plate&#13;
         prices above those charged by the large companies, and there&#13;
         is considerable talk of perhaps price increases by some of&#13;
         the larger steel companies later this year.     Our studies&#13;
    i	   indicate that Yawatats operations would be in the black at&#13;
Ii 	&#13;
II       prices 15 to 20 percent below present prices.&#13;
,I&#13;
J:&#13;
;~&#13;
Ii            Yawata and other Japanese steel companies have relied&#13;
j;&#13;
"&#13;
;'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    , 	 heavily on debt financing in recent years to effectuate&#13;
    ,&#13;
         these investment programs.   This year, however, Yawata has&#13;
         raised over $10 million equivalent in new equity capital,&#13;
         in addition to retained earnings, of course.&#13;
              The Yawata management is aware of the need for improveÂ­&#13;
         ment of its financial structure and has agreed to take steps&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   24&#13;
    to improve its financial position.&#13;
       \ From the standpoint of the Japanese economy as a whole,&#13;
    an increased supply of low-cost, high-quality plate should be&#13;
    of assistance in maintaining Japanese steel exports.      In&#13;
    addition, the ability of Japanese heavy industry to meet&#13;
    foreign competition should be strengthened, especially in&#13;
    those products such as ships and freight cars, where plates&#13;
    constitute a substantial cost element.&#13;
         In view of the size of the economies relative to the&#13;
[ proposed investment, the present ability of Japanese plate&#13;
    makers to meet foreign competition, the agreed measures to be&#13;
I   taken to improve Yawatals finances, and the probable benefits&#13;
    to Japan1s export earnings, I have no heSitation in&#13;
    recommending approval of this project for Bank financing.&#13;
         THE CHAIRMAN:     Thank you.   Any questions?&#13;
         MR. WARREN:     Mr. Chairman, in a project like this is&#13;
    there much value that attaches to the three mills that will&#13;
    be replaced? Will something be realized from these three&#13;
    mills?&#13;
         MR. LIPKOWITZ:     Relatively small.   Some of the auxiliary&#13;
    equipment will be used in the new mill, but it is mainly&#13;
    auxiliary equipment.     The rest will be primarily scrap.&#13;
         MR. WARREN:     No significant reduction in costs from the&#13;
    realization ot these assets?&#13;
         MR. LIPKOWITZ:     Nothing of importance.   As you may have 
&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         25&#13;
     not1ced, the deprec1at10n allowance currently 1s less than&#13;
     100 yen per ton.      If part of th1s 1s to be re-used, the&#13;
     deprec1at10n amount that would be w1ped out would be&#13;
     relat1vely small.&#13;
           THE CHAIRMAN:     Any other quest10ns?&#13;
           MR. KAMAT:    There 1s one po1nt wh1ch I am not sure&#13;
     whether you have missed 1n these papers.        The loan w111 be&#13;
     made to the Development Bank, and the Development Bank w111&#13;
1    re-loan the money to th.ts steel company.       What are the terms&#13;
     of relend1ng of th1s loan?      Do   we know?&#13;
           MR. DORR:    The spec1f1c terms of the relend1ng are&#13;
     spelled out 1n a subs1d1ary loan agreement, wh1ch of course&#13;
     would be between the Development Bank and Yawata, but wh1ch&#13;
     has been cons1dered 1n the course of the negot1at10ns, and&#13;
     1ndeed both part1es have agreed that they w1l1 not amend th1s&#13;
,I&#13;
q	&#13;
     agreement w1thout our consent.       The most 1mportant s1ngle&#13;
'i&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
i 	 term   1s perhaps the 1nterest rate.       It was agreed that The&#13;
     Japan Development Bank w111 not charge more than 1/2 of 1&#13;
     percent above the rate wh1ch we are charg1ng.        That was a&#13;
     matter of some d1scuss10n 1n the negot1at10ns.        Ord1nar11y,&#13;
Ii&#13;
Ii 	 The Japan Development Bank charges 1 percent. 'We felt that&#13;
     1t would not be proper to go beyond the 1/2 of 1 percent, 1n&#13;
     the absence of some clear show1ng that The Japan Development&#13;
     Bank could not handle the matter for that 1/2 of 1 percent,&#13;
     and that 1s what we f1nally agreed on.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       26&#13;
          The subs1d1ary loan agreement, of oourse, oonta1ns many&#13;
     prov1s10ns 1n regard to seour1ty, and I think 1f you would&#13;
     l1ke a full explanat10n of those 1t m1ght be most appropr1ate&#13;
     for oounsel to oomment upon them.      It is prov1ded 1n the loan      i&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     doouments that 1f Yawata should ant101pate 1ts payments under&#13;
     the subs1diary loan agreement, then The Japan Development&#13;
, Bank will make a oorrespond1ng aooelerat10n of 1ts payments&#13;
     to us.&#13;
          MR. KAMAT:     Who bears the exohange risk?&#13;
:	        MR. DORB:      The exohange r1sk 1s borne by Yawata Steel.&#13;
          THE CHAIRMAN:      Any further questions?&#13;
          MR. WARREN:      Mr. Cha1rman, I should just like to oomment&#13;
     br1efiy on the eoonom10 report.      There 1s a statement that&#13;
     Japan's abi11ty to 1mport from the dollar area w1ll oont1nue&#13;
     to depend, of oourse, on her dollar area exports and the&#13;
     soale of U.   s. speo1al reoe1pts. I would like to note in&#13;
     pass1ng that perhaps a fuller statement would 1nd1oate that&#13;
     1t would also depend on any surplus she may be able to earn&#13;
     with th1rd countries, and the extent to wh10h those surpluses&#13;
     are or may become available.&#13;
          THE CHAIRMAN:      Any other questions?&#13;
          MR. YUMOl'O:    Mr. Chairman" I want to make olear one&#13;
     point on the report and reoommendations.         At page 6,&#13;
, paragraph 28, on the external oredits, when you look at the&#13;
     report on the reoent eoonom10 and financ1al development 1n&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         27&#13;
     Japan, Annex 8 further explains       th1s~tter.     I just wanted to&#13;
     point out that the staff has made a very brief statement with&#13;
     re~rd   to external affairs that may give some misunderstanding&#13;
i    The point is that the total amount settled between Japan on&#13;
     one side and Burma and Thailand is here reported as $291&#13;
     million, but out of this $291 million, $76 million will be the&#13;
     amount which will be invested in these two countries.          ThereÂ­&#13;
                                                           ,&#13;
     fore, the net amount of the reparation and         th~ccupation 
&#13;
&#13;
     clatms will be $215 million.       So this total amount of 
&#13;
     $291 million also includes the investment of $76 million. 
&#13;
     I don't mean to change the statement, but I just draw 
&#13;
     attention that this total amount also includes investment. 
&#13;
          THE CHAIRMAN:     Any other questions?    If there are no&#13;
i&#13;
:(&#13;
     further questions and no discussion, I want to advise that&#13;
     the Manufacturers Trust Company Wishes to participate in this&#13;
     loan to the extent of $791,000.       They will be purchasing the&#13;
     first five maturities of this loan.       The rate on this will&#13;
     be 4 percent.&#13;
          If there is no further discussion, I would like to have&#13;
I: a motion to adopt the draft resolution and to approve the&#13;
I,&#13;
i&#13;
!i&#13;
     participation of the Manufacturers Trust Company. 
&#13;
          MR. OVERBY:     So moved. 
&#13;
          MR. HEURTEMATTE:     Second. 
&#13;
         (The motion was put to a voice vote and carried&#13;
     unanimously. )&#13;
          THE CHAIRMAN:     I hereby declare the loan of $5.3 million&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         28&#13;
         to The Japan Development Bank approved.&#13;
              MR. YUMCYrO:    Mr. Chairman" on behalf of the Japanese&#13;
,i . Government,      I wish f1rst of all to thank the Board for the&#13;
