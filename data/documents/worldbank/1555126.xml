WORLD TRADE AND OUTPUT OF MANUFACTURES: STRUCTURAL&#13;
TRENDS AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES' EXPORTS&#13;
This is a revised version of a paper originally completed in February 1978,&#13;
as a background study for the World Development Report 1978. Compared to the Report,&#13;
it uses somewhat narrower definitions of developing countries and of manufactures.&#13;
Developing countries' manufactured exports increased from 1960 through 1976&#13;
at rates around 15 percent per year. This paper is concerned with the changing&#13;
structural features of these exports and how they relate to world manufacturing output&#13;
and markets, which have expanded much more slowly. Numerous relationships are explored,&#13;
with speculative interpretations as well as tables. Here are examples of findings:&#13;
the share of manufacturing output traded internationally in market economies has risen&#13;
rapidly, but remains less than one sixth, and is lower in developing countries. The&#13;
share of LDC exports in manufactures in developed countries has recently passed one&#13;
percent, and ranges in individual countries from about 0.5 to 2 percent; but examples&#13;
are given of much higher penetration in narrow product lines. Even these exports come&#13;
mainly from a few countries and consist predominantly of labor-intensive goods such&#13;
as clothing and electronic assembly products; rapid export growth has also taken place&#13;
in a wide range of other products and in many other LDCs, and has extended to trade&#13;
in manufactures among developing countries themselves, which has quite a different&#13;
composition.&#13;
The author would like to thank Bela Balassa, Larry Westphal, Martin Wolf&#13;

WORLD TRADE AND OUTPUT OF MANUFACTURES: STRUCTURAL&#13;
TRENDS AND DEVELOPMENT COUNTRIES' EXPORTS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
This note examines some of the major trends in world trade and&#13;
output of manufactures in the 1960's and 1970's with special reference to&#13;
the growth of developing countries' exports. To spice up what might&#13;
otherwise be a mindless parade of tables, some attention is paid to what&#13;
the writer sees as likely reasons for (or implications of) some of the&#13;
relationships. These remarks will serve their purpose if they stimulate&#13;
thought and discussion.&#13;
The World Location of Manufacturing Output vs. GNP&#13;
Before looking at trade and trends it may be useful to look briefly&#13;
at the world location of manufacturing output in a recent year. In 1973-the&#13;
latest year for which suitable data are fully available--GNP originating in&#13;
manufacturing appears to have been close to $1,080 billion in the market&#13;
economies, or about 27% of their total GNP.   By regions the picture was&#13;
approximately as follows. No estimate is given for centrally-planned eco-&#13;
nomies (CPEs) because of the conceptual problems involved, but Chenery gives&#13;
an estimate of $308 billion for their manufacturing output in 1973, for&#13;
purposes of comparison with market economy figures. 1/&#13;

in Bertil Ohlin, Per-Ove Hesselborn and Per Magnus Wijkmans, editors,&#13;
The International Allocation of Economic Activity: Proceedings of a&#13;
Novel Symposium held at Stockholm,_ Macmillan Press, 1977. The World-&#13;
Bank's World Tables, 1976, gives a ratio .of 51.7% of GDP at factor --&#13;
prices coming from manufacturing in 1973. Combined with World Bank&#13;
Atlas' GNP figure of $996 billion, this might imply manufacturing costs&#13;
of S500 billion.&#13;

Sources:  GNP from World Bank Atlas 1976; GW? from aEufaetuxing estimated based&#13;
on shares of GDP from manufacturing at factor prices in 'World Tables&#13;
1976; real output growth from World Tables.&#13;
A striking feature of this cooparison ls thQ enormity of the con-&#13;
trasts in absolute and per capita manufacturing output a0ong different groups&#13;
oi countries, not least among the developing countries themsQlves. 1/    At the&#13;
extremes, GM?P per head from wanufacturing is in thc@ ordev of 100 tg@;s larger&#13;
in leading developed countries than in South AoiA or, for that mattigr, the&#13;
low@r-income countries as a group.&#13;
1/   GNP from manufacturing is in effect a net form of value added, not output&#13;
in the usual phase of gross output, but the ttwo are, of course, closely&#13;
related.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
Although not free of price distortions caused by protection, these&#13;
contrasts in GNP from manufacturing are more "real" than the corresponding&#13;
contrasts in total GNP. Contrasts in the dollar value of GNP are partly&#13;
caused by very different price levels among different countries, particularly&#13;
in regard to services and construction, and also in regard to the less trade-&#13;
able agricultural products, which are often very cheap in low-income areas.&#13;
What looks like a fifty-to-one difference in per capita income turns out&#13;
to be much less in the richer country's prices. Depending on how this is&#13;
done, the difference can be narrowed to much less than ten to one, or (as in&#13;
the Kravis, et al., international comparisons project) some in-between number&#13;
in the order of 20 to 1. In manufacturing, however, the contrast is not only&#13;
larger prior to adjustment, but if agricultural processing, repair and handi-&#13;
crafts are not counted, this difference is very real indeed, because prices of&#13;
manufacturers tend to be broadly similar in different countries as a result of&#13;
trade.&#13;
Contrasts in industrial output per head are partly caused by, but&#13;
also help to cause the more familiar contrasts in income. Manufacturing&#13;
produces a smaller proportion of GNP in the poorest and least developed&#13;
countries than in richer ones, partly because the structure of demand favors&#13;
food and other simple products for subsistence, and partly because industrial&#13;
capabilities tend to be especially backward. If this second obstacle can be&#13;
overcome, an impoverished country can begin to export manufactures as a way&#13;
out of both inadequate demand and poverty itself, as Hong Kong and later South&#13;
Korea did. But the route around the dilemma may be more difficult and the&#13;
road to industrialization may be a long one for a country with fairly ample&#13;
natural resources but underdeveloped human resources. Here it may be diffi-&#13;
cult to export and difficult to generate much domestic demand.&#13;
In any event, using Chenery's figure for the CPEs, the developing&#13;
countries' share of world GNP from manufacturing reached 8.8% in 1973. Three&#13;
fifths of this came from Latin America, Yugoslavia and Turkey. 1/ Only 1.3%&#13;
of world manufacturing value added came from South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
which together contained 27.8% of the world's population.&#13;
The total GNP from manufacturing in the developing countries in&#13;
1973 was about equal to that of Japan and smaller than that of West Germany.&#13;
Only six developing countries had GNP from manufacturing of more than $4 bil-&#13;
lion in 1973, according to the estimates underlying Table 3: in billions&#13;
of dollars the value of this GNP was 19.6 in Brazil, 13.9 in Mexico, 12.2 in&#13;
Argentina, 9.8 in India, 7.0 in Yugoslavia and 5.9 in Turkey. 2/ Nineteen&#13;
of the developed market economies (as defined in the table) were above this&#13;
level, together with the eight largest CPEs.&#13;
1/'  The definition of developing countries can-be seen from Table 1; it is&#13;
not the same as the one used in the World Bank's World Development Report&#13;
1978.&#13;
2,   These numbers are distorted in varying degrees by protection and un-&#13;
realistic exchange rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Table 1 also shows sharp dif erences    ong regions In output&#13;
grouth within manufacturing, as illustrated by "real'" growth rates for&#13;
1965-73. The fastest growth rates (12'13% per year) have been achieved&#13;
by Japan and the East Asian developing counuties, relying on exceptionally&#13;
export-oriented policies. The nezt highcst growth rates (8-9%) have&#13;
come in the transitional and developing countries of Southern Europe&#13;
and the Mediterranean, closely rivalled by Latin Awerica (defined here&#13;
to include the Caribbean)0 The slowest growth rates (under 5%) have&#13;
been recorded in the "older'" developed countrics, especially those of&#13;
North America (3.3%), and in South Asia and Sub5Saharan Africao&#13;
Taking into account population growth the industrial growth record in&#13;
these low-income regions has been disoal0&#13;
Trends in Output by Broad Product Grous&#13;
Manufacturing output has grown faster in developing countries&#13;
than in developed ones. Within manufacturing relatively high growth&#13;
rates of output have been achieved at a woeld level in machinery,&#13;
transport equipment, chemicals, and other industlies producing tech-&#13;
nically complex products. Reflecting trends in damand, the slowest&#13;
growth is found in the textile, clothing, foote-iar and leather product&#13;
industries0 Growth rates in developing coumtries have been especially&#13;
high relative to those in developed countries, in metal products&#13;
including machinery and equipment, basic aetals, and clothing and&#13;
foot-wear0 Advances in supply capability play a role along with&#13;
demand.&#13;

The faster overall growth of manufacturing output in the developing&#13;
countries is probably due in part to long-run influences, for example:&#13;
(1)  Starting from low incomes and a low base, developing&#13;
countries have greater needs to meet, and as "latecomers"&#13;
have much scope to expand output and generate demand&#13;
by imitating the techniques and tastes of the richest&#13;
countries; while developed countries have less guidance&#13;
on where to go next.&#13;
(2)  Population has grown faster in the poor countries, enlarging&#13;
the market while reducing the contrast in growth rates on&#13;
a per capita basis. 1/&#13;
(3)  Even though there have been wide differences among coun-&#13;
tries and regions, over the last 15 years, as a group,&#13;
developing countries have almost certainly made greater&#13;
strides than developed ones in improving economic manage-&#13;
ment and policies, and may have tried harder to foster&#13;
growth of output and industry.&#13;
These three influences do not begin to explain, however, why the&#13;
poorest and least industrialized of the developing countries have done worse&#13;
than the rest. The explanations here may lie in a combination of poorly&#13;
chosen policies and difficulties in expanding the market.&#13;
Exoort vs. Output Growth in Manufacturing&#13;
International trade in manufactured products has expanded in&#13;
the 1960's and 1970's at much higher real growth rates than manufactur-&#13;
ing output, especially in the market economies. As one result, the market&#13;
economies increased their exports of manufactures relative to their output of&#13;
manufactures by about 60 % in the nine-year period from 1965 through 1974 and&#13;
more since then. This trend appears to result from trade liberalization in&#13;
and among the industrial countries, improved long-distance communications,&#13;
increased export efforts in many countries, and increased international&#13;
operations by private business firms.&#13;
Meanwhile, especially in recent years since 1965, exports as well&#13;
as output of manufactures have grown faster in the developing countries&#13;
than in the developed countries. The next table shows some of the long-&#13;
term trends. Statistics refer to different definitions of manufactures&#13;
1/   The difference in population growth has been in the order of 1.5%&#13;
per year in recent years. Populations of developed countries have&#13;
been growing at 0.8% to 0.9%, those of developing counries at 2.3%&#13;
to 2.4% per year. Note, however, that the relationship between&#13;
population growth and industrial development can be complex, because&#13;
savings and the structure of demand are likely to be affected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
=6&#13;
because the output data include natugal resources processing industries, for&#13;
example, food9 peeroletm refining, and nonfeErous metals, in which exports&#13;
are countered as primary commodities. 1/&#13;

Reasons for especially rapid growth in           of manufactures&#13;
from developing countries appear to include above all the following:&#13;
(1) Export incentives and industrial politics have becn improved&#13;
in many developing countries, shifting awey from excessive&#13;
emphasis on import substituion and production only for the&#13;
domestic market;&#13;
(2)  Exporting of manufactures is so new that it has expanded from&#13;
a small base with much benefit from learning and cumulative&#13;
experience;&#13;
1/   Throughout this paper statistics on exports of manufactures refer to&#13;
Standard Incernational Trade Classification (SITC) 5-8 less 68, excluding&#13;
non-ferrous metals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
(3) Supply capabilities have leaped forward through transfer&#13;
of technology and borrowing of production methods from&#13;
developed countries, aided by rapid buildups of skilled&#13;
manpower, know-how, and investment in some developing&#13;
countries;&#13;
(4) Trade liberalization in developed countries has been&#13;
favorable to imports from developing countries;&#13;
(5)  Businesses in developed countries--retail chains, other&#13;
large buyers, trading firms, and multinational manu-&#13;
facturing corporations--have played an active and&#13;
crucial role while seeking low-cost sources of supply&#13;
based on low-cost labor. Their efforts, which have&#13;
greatly accelerated export growth, have been spurred&#13;
by slow labor force growth and rising real wages&#13;
in developed countries as well as by declining transport&#13;
costs, technological and organizational innovations, and&#13;
a favorable international policy environment.&#13;
Recent Vicissitudes and the Worldwide Recession&#13;
The growth performance of developing countries looks all the better&#13;
when compared to the depressed state of the developed countries in recent&#13;
years as a result of the recession that reached the bottom in 1975. Index,&#13;
numbers of manufacturing production and exports illustrate the pattern of&#13;
their recent fluctuations. Production in the developed countries was hardly&#13;
greater in 1977 than in 1973, while industrial output in developing countries&#13;
has continued to expand.&#13;

The reasons for the sevevity of the 1974675 recession and the&#13;
weakness of the recovery are obviously a metter of much concern and dispute.&#13;
?erhaos it would not be out of place to miention here a few of the e3Kplanaa&#13;
tions that are widely offered as hypotheses, together with postulated reasons&#13;
why these troubles have not equally afflicted the developing countriesO&#13;
(1)  The sharp rise in oil prices in 1973074 has had defla-&#13;
tionary effe@ts in developed counegis      d has shigted&#13;
the structure of relative prices xand dewsnd in direcc&#13;
tions that have made some of their production capacity&#13;
obsolete. Developing countries had feewe iavestmSnts&#13;
affected, while some-the oil eYporters_2gained frow&#13;
the price rise.&#13;
(2)  Deflationary policies, pursued in leading developed&#13;
countries following the 1972-73 `suparbooi" and the&#13;
rise in oil prices, aggravated tho deflationaU&#13;
effects. Most developing countries tried instead&#13;
to maintain the pace of development, by borrowing if&#13;
necessary .&#13;
(3)  A long downswing or down cycle in econoic stotimalation&#13;
from technological innovation may have aggravated thio&#13;
recession. Advances in technology havo led in the richer&#13;
countries to much displacemeat of unskMlled labor throough&#13;
automation and reorganization; this has not been ade°&#13;
quatel7 offset bv new "boom" industnios0    Heanwhile, the&#13;
developing countries still know where to go est=0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
(4) More than the usual overbuilding of capacity may have taken&#13;
place in the late 1960's and early 1970's while the world&#13;
economy was t"overheating" through excess creation of&#13;
liquidity (e.g., from the U.S. payments deficit caused by&#13;
inappropriate fixed exchange rates and the Vietnam War).&#13;
Some developing countries (especially oil exporters) may&#13;
now be overbuilding capacity in expensive projects, but as&#13;
a group, they could not afford much of this in the past.&#13;
(5) Developed countries have little capability as yet to grow&#13;
in the face of inflation because their tax systems are&#13;
poorly designed for this--not being indexed, they still&#13;
tax income earners, businesses, and investors as if nominal&#13;
gains were real gains, leaving them inadequate purchasing&#13;
power, capital investment and replacement funds, and in-&#13;
centives. Developing countries have this problem less&#13;
because their tax system are cruder or (in a few cases)&#13;
better indexed.&#13;
(6) Leading developed countries have not yet learned to manage&#13;
their economies jointly and cannot agree on the principles&#13;
in the face of recession combined with inflation. More&#13;
specifically, West German anti-inflationary preferences&#13;
combined with a high degree of interdependence have&#13;
induced Western Europe to adopt a slow-slowth response&#13;
which helps to hold back recovery everywhere. Developing&#13;
countries generally seek growth even at some cost in&#13;
inflation.&#13;
(7) Private businesses in the richer countries are said to&#13;
be dissuaded from investing by added uncertainty connected&#13;
with shifting exchange rates, and by policies emphasizing&#13;
social welfare, the environment, etc., at the expense of&#13;
business-profits: growth and other older goals have been&#13;
downgraded as priorities. In most developing countries&#13;
no such change has taken place:   policies aim squarely&#13;
at growth and development while uncertainty-springs&#13;
mainly from conditions at a local level.&#13;
Some of these explanations, if-correct, would imply that the de-&#13;
pressed condition of the developed countries can be expected to continue for&#13;
several more years until different policies or new technological stimuli'&#13;
appear. Thus, the developing countries might have to contend with a dis-&#13;
couraging-international econiomic environment for years to come. In these&#13;
circumstances it is fortunate that their growth has not proved highly&#13;
dependent on a buoyant world economy.&#13;
Trade as a Share bf OutDut&#13;
To derive a figure for manufacturing output that would be roughly-&#13;
comparable to exports, two main adjustments become necessary:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
° 10 °&#13;
(1)  The definition of manufactures taust be narrowd co match&#13;
the trade definition (SITC 5-8 minus 68)o This corresponds&#13;
to eliminating a small fraction of the ONP from manufacturing&#13;
(15-20% in most countries)0 I/ In addition, some further&#13;
deflation may be required to reflect the differences between&#13;
domestic and world priceso&#13;
(2)  A conversion must be made from GNP (or value addd) from&#13;
aanufactures to gross output or manufacturers' shipments&#13;
since exports correspond to shipments. In some cases gross&#13;
output data are directly available for a narrow definition&#13;
of manufactures, but even here there are questions of defini-&#13;
tion:  for example, some countries exclude intra-fixm shipments&#13;
that should probably be included0 On average for all manu-&#13;
factures, gross output is in the order of 2.5 to 3 times&#13;
GNP generated. 2/&#13;
Taking all available data into consideration, it appears that for a&#13;
narrow definition of manufacturing gross world manufacturing output (shipments)&#13;
in 1973, including CPEs, must have been around $3,000 billion in world prices,&#13;
give or take a few hundred billion. For the aarket economies alone they must&#13;
have been in the order of $2,200 billion, of which nearly S250 billion came&#13;
from developing countries and the rest from developed areas0&#13;
By comparison, world exports of manufactures narrowly defined&#13;
(SITC 5-8 ainus 68) in 1973 were equal to about $350 billion, or about 12% of&#13;
gross output. For the market economies, exports of manufactures comprised&#13;
about 14% of production0 The ratio between imports and constmption must have&#13;
been also about 14%oo In 1965 these last ratios must have been lower, in&#13;
the order of 9%; by 1976 they must have reached 15-16%o&#13;
A First Look at Trade in Manufactures&#13;
The table below provides a first look at the value of exports of&#13;
manufactures, by regions0 East Asia is the most export-oriented developing&#13;
1/   Industries that must be excluded are food, beverages, tobacco, petroleum,&#13;
products, basic nonferrous metals, and a part of wod products, pulp and&#13;
paper (since samn wood and pulp are in SITC 2),&#13;
2/   Based on available data in UN Yearbook of Industrial Statistics, 1975,&#13;
the ratio of gross output to value added in manufacturing in 1973 was&#13;
2.474 in developed countries and 2.675 in developing countries0 How-&#13;
ever, definitions of "gross output" vary among countries and are&#13;
sensitive to the treatment of intra-fim    transactions, while "value&#13;
added" in many countries includes purchases of services, power, etc.,&#13;
so that it is not as "net" as GNP originating in manufacturing0    The&#13;
ratio tends to be somewhat higher in naeural resource processing than&#13;
in other manufacturing narrowlv defined to match the trade definition0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
region, and has achieved the most rapid expansion of its exports of masu-&#13;
factured products, largely as a result of its exceptionally export-oriented&#13;
policies. There and elsewhere developing countries' exports come pre-&#13;
dominantly from a small number of countries, as will be shown later. 1/&#13;

In this table and in the previous computations, it is instructive&#13;
to observe how little of the world's manufacturing output is exported, even&#13;
in the most export-oriented economies, those of East Asia and Western Europe.&#13;
This share is generally no more than one third even in highly export-oriented&#13;
economies. For example, according to their input-output tables it was 24% in&#13;
Korea in 1973 and 28% in Taiwan in 1971. I/ In many other regions, as the&#13;
table shows, it is less than 10%. How much trade counts as internal is&#13;
strongly related, of course, to the size of the country.&#13;
The smallness of the share of world output that is traded inter-&#13;
nationally is due in part to the inherent obstacles to long-distance trade.&#13;
These consist principally of transport costs and information costs. As a&#13;
result of these costs, apart from some natural resource processing industries&#13;
that locate near to raw materials, a majority of industries tend to locate&#13;
near final markets. This tendency has doubtless been accentuated by past&#13;
efforts of each country to industrialize across a wide spectrum of indus-&#13;
tries using protection as required. Cost pressures to locate industries near&#13;
markets are undoubtedly a major reason for the small dimensions of industries&#13;
in developing countries. They also mean that protection is hardly needed to&#13;
generate industrial development if incomes can be sharply raised.&#13;
The limited share of exports in output also comes about, in Korea&#13;
or Taiwan, because successful exports (combined with agricultural output&#13;
growth) have led to a rapid growth of income and market demand. This demand--&#13;
interacting with the same industrial capabilities that have helped to cause&#13;
export growth--has permitted a very rapid expansion of output for the home&#13;
market parallel to the export growth. 2/&#13;
Whatever may be the reasons, however, it can tentatively be con-&#13;
cluded that in most developing countries of ordinary dimensions, even if&#13;
export promotion is pushed to the hilt, exports of manufacturers are not&#13;
-likely to become much-more than 20 or 30 percent of industrial output narrowly-&#13;
defined (as it is in Table 6) to exclude natural resource processing. These&#13;
exports of manufactures may be essential to pay for imports of capital&#13;
goods and intermediate inputs to develop fully the economy. They may con-&#13;
tribute to growth in other sectors and help to free key industries from the&#13;
rigid limitations of the domestic demand pattern. They will allow some&#13;

2/1 -This process of rapid industrialization seems to involve a whole host&#13;
of "virtous circles" along with learning sequences and favorable dynamic&#13;
effects involving scale and specialization as well as learning. However,&#13;
the benefits of exports and outward-looking policies in contributing to&#13;
industrialization are outside the scope of this paper.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14 &#13;
rationalization of the industrial structure to take advantage of economies&#13;
of scale and specialization. But the ratio still means that industrial&#13;
development must be built largely around the doaestic market0&#13;
In strategies of industrialization, too little attention has been&#13;
given to expansion of the domestic markget   This involves, among other&#13;
things, increasing agricultural output, widespread advances in productivity,&#13;
systematic government purchases and procurment, wonetiz-ation of the economy,&#13;
improvements in the system of finance and credit, improvemaents in transport&#13;
and communications, wide distribution of incoes gains, eDpanded and improved&#13;
distribution including increases in the range and quality of products avail-&#13;
able0&#13;
The table also illustrates some other important relationships0   The&#13;
real growth rate of manufactured goods exports from 195-74 appears to have&#13;
been in the order of 21% per year in developing East Asia and    la   America,&#13;
18% in the transitional countries of Southern Europe and the Hediterranean,&#13;
and 15% in Japan and in North Africa and the Middle Easto Thus, countries in&#13;
the upper middle reaches of the development spectru -those recently added to&#13;
the developed ranks, transitional countries and the more advanced developing&#13;
countries--generally expanded these exports faster than the richest developed&#13;
countries at one end and the poorer and least inductrialized countries at the&#13;
other. The table also shows that exports of manufactures remained less then&#13;
5% of total merchandise exports from Africa and the Middle East in 19739&#13;
compared to about 15% in Latin America, about 50% in East and South Asia, and&#13;
71% in the developed countries0&#13;
In 1973, the developing countries had 50.2% of the world's popu-&#13;
lation, about 13% of its GNP, 8.8% of its manufacturing output, and 6.9% of&#13;
its exports of manufactures.&#13;
The disproportionately large share of the developed countries&#13;
and especially Western Europe in world trade in manufactures can be further&#13;
illustrated by the following table.&#13;

This large share is evidently caused partly by the small geo-&#13;
graohical dimensions of many of the Western European countries, so that much&#13;
trade counts as international that would be internal in North America, and&#13;
partly by the removal of trade barriers and the high degree of economic&#13;
integration in the area.&#13;
Recent Increases in Developing Countries' Exports&#13;
Although worldwide export data are not yet available for 1976 with&#13;
manufactures d.saggregated, preliminary estimates for developing countries&#13;
have been made based on national statistics. The results, which would&#13;
probably change slightly with newly reported data, are as follows.    They are&#13;
shown together with regional shares illustrating the rising share of East&#13;
Asia and the declining shares of South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and others.&#13;

Total Exports from developing Countries," June 6, 1977, based oan&#13;

Here and in most other tables now available, developing countries'&#13;
exports of manufactures are slightly exaggerated by inclusion of re-exports&#13;
from Hong Kong, Singapore and some Middle Eastern countries and the inclusion&#13;
of uncut diamonds (in SITC 667) and a few oLher inappropriate natural resource&#13;
products, due to peculiarities of the UN trade classification0 1/&#13;
This table helps to show further the huge gains made in 1976 when&#13;
these exports of manufactures jmBped by more than $10 billion in one year,&#13;
even though international trade prices for developed countries' manufactures&#13;
rose by less than one percent in that year0 The strong grouth of these&#13;
exports in the recession and recovery bespeak a remarkable mowentmk and an&#13;
ability to remain highly competitive in a umak market0&#13;
Even more striking is the fact that three fifths of the 1976 exports&#13;
and a larger share of the growth have come from East Asia where they can be&#13;
traced mainly to Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kon80 2/    The relatively poor showing&#13;
by South Asia was, everyone seems to agree, caused largely by policies that&#13;
1/   The total effect as of 1975 was between 2.5 and 3 billion dollars, offset&#13;
slightly by underreporting of manufactured exports in a few countries0&#13;
(Only Mexico's exports have been corrected based on developed countries'&#13;
import data0)&#13;

discouraged exports, but this may not be the whole story even in India, and it&#13;
is almost certainly not the main story in some other South Asian countries,&#13;
the Middle East and Africa. Rather, apart from India these countries have&#13;
acquired little generalized industrial capability as yet; their exports of&#13;
manufactures have been based all along on a few products related to local&#13;
natural resources and/or simple specialties (e.g., Iranian hand-knotted&#13;
carpets, South Asian cotton textiles). Hence, their share would probably&#13;
have declined even with optimal policies.&#13;

This matrix illustrates the distribution of exports (and the&#13;
sources of imports) for each broad group of countries. About 35% of the&#13;
world's trade in manufactures takes place within Western Europe and 60%&#13;
among developed countries. Developing countries' imports of manufactures&#13;
are more than three times as large as their exports of manufactured goods.&#13;
Nearly 85% come from developed market economies.&#13;

Market Economies' Exports by Destinations&#13;
Over a long period up to 1973, the developed countries expanded&#13;
their imports of manufactures faster than the developing countries, liberal-&#13;
izing their imports very substantially in the process. 1/ As a result,&#13;
exports from both developed and developing countries have been increasingly&#13;
directed to the richer countries rather than the poor ones. This can be&#13;
illustrated by data from the UNCTAD Handbook. 2/&#13;

From 1973 to 1975, this trend reversed itself, and imports by&#13;
developing countries grew as a share of the total. The principal reasons&#13;
appear to have been 1) the oil price rise and consequent boom leading to a&#13;
rapisd-increase in imports in oil exporting countries, 2) a better economic&#13;
performance in the oil importing developing countries as a group than in&#13;
the developed countries, which were more affected by the recession, and,&#13;
closely related to this, 3) sizeable borrowing by the oil importing coun-&#13;
tries to maintain their import growth.   Whatever the reasons, the oil import-&#13;
ing developing countries accounted for 16.7% of world imports of manufactures&#13;
in both 1974 and 1975 compared to 15.22 in 1973. In 1976 their share must&#13;
have fallen once again as a result of the recovery in developed countries&#13;
and stringent economic management holding down imports in most developing&#13;
countries.&#13;

to developed countries. Elsewhere including South Asia, there are substantial&#13;
exports to both developed and developing countries. ECept in Yugoslavia&#13;

Trade in Manufactures Among Developina Countries&#13;
The matrix of trade among developing countries in 1976, by major&#13;
geographical regions, is shown below based on UN estimates. The principal&#13;
point to note is that trade among developing countries takes place mainly&#13;
within major regions. The numbers in the matrix are exaggerated by the&#13;
inclusion of over $2 billion in reexports from Singapore, Hong Kong, and&#13;
some of the smaller Middle Eastern countries. Excluding these reexports&#13;
would substantially reduce the trade within the Asian and Middle Eastern&#13;
regions.&#13;
Even if this trade is excluded, exports to other developing coun-&#13;
tries are considerably larger, relative to their GNP (and thus as a share of&#13;
their markets) than exports to developed countries. The main explanation&#13;
seems to be proximity: a large share of trade in manufactures takes place&#13;
within broad geographic regions than between them. This appears due primarily&#13;
to transport costs and information costs, reinforced by regional preferential&#13;
schemes such as comon markets.&#13;

Structural Change and Diversification in Davelo inS CountKrie2o ermOvts&#13;
Along with rapid grouth9 the devsloping countrien' eorts of&#13;
manufactured products have gone through a process of structural change and&#13;
diversification9 changing their product coWositiono This process has been&#13;
accelerated by increasingly appropriate policies but the uaxderlying ipetus&#13;
comes from development itself9 leading to a growiing ability to coWete&#13;
internationally in an ever-lengthening list of preoducts9 proceses aznd&#13;
act4 vities.&#13;
These changes are not confined to wm:aufactures-they oEtead to&#13;
numerous primary production and processing activities and serices-but&#13;
the overall effect has been to increase greatly the share of wnMufactures&#13;
in developing countries° exports, as the anet table illustrazeos&#13;

Within manufacturing the composition has also shifted because, while&#13;
practically all manufactured exports have expanded, some have increased much&#13;
faster than others. Rapid growth has occurred in exports of the more technic-&#13;
ally sophisticated products and in finished goods, particularly clothing and&#13;
shoes, where information and marketing barriers and long distances had to be&#13;
overcome. The effects on the structure of exports are shown at a very aggre-&#13;
gated level in the following table.&#13;

Within broad product groups as t1l, an enoraious amount of diver-&#13;
sification has taken place so that the number of products exported success-&#13;
fully has multiplied rapidly. 1/ This has been especially true in the&#13;
fast-growing product groups0&#13;
Developing Countres' Growing Share of World Ezports&#13;
Even though other countries' exports of manufactures also greu&#13;
rapidly, the developing countries succeeded in increasing their export&#13;
shares in most major products as the next table illustrates. Their strong&#13;
performance in manufactures contrasts with a declining share in other&#13;
nonfuel exports. Note that apart from fuel they had less than one third&#13;
of the world's exports in 1975 in each product group shown; in 1976 they&#13;
passed this level in clothing, for the first timeo&#13;

Differences in the Composition of Developing Countries' Exports by Destination&#13;
There are substantial differences in the composition of developing&#13;
countries' exports of manufactures by destination, as illustrated by the&#13;
table below.&#13;
Some products such as clothing and electronic equipment go mainly&#13;
to developed countries. Capital goods are sold mainly to other developing&#13;
countries (although the statistics here are distorted by reexports). Textiles&#13;
and chemicals are the other leading items in trade among developing countries.&#13;

Here some explanations may be in order. Reasons for these sub-&#13;
stantial diff-erences almost certainly include the following:&#13;
(1)  World markets for ready-made clothing and electronic equipment&#13;
are overwhelmingly located in the richer countries. In these&#13;
products and a few others (e.g., shoes, toys, sporting goods)&#13;
developing countries' industries are set up to supply these&#13;
markets, and sell mainly there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(2)  In bulky and/or standardised producer goods such as chem.cals,&#13;
steel, building mterials,, cotton yarn and heavy equiponnt,&#13;
developing couatries export to each other based on transport&#13;
cost advantages from proximAty, using output in esess of&#13;
their domsstic needs to mnet deficits in neighboring&#13;
countries.&#13;
(3)  In machinery, ukotor vehicles and cons uoar goods (ego , cotton&#13;
fabrics), the developing couatr-iez products tend to be&#13;
better suited to one another's factor supply conditions and&#13;
income levels than are products froim richer countries, so&#13;
that they my trade uith each othcr by preference0&#13;
(4) Interchanges of complex products (and some others) are often&#13;
facilitated by comwon arkret accords9, otably in Latin&#13;
America, involving exchanges of protection and preferential&#13;
treatment, and also by common languages and cultural ties&#13;
from shared colonial or ethuic heritageo0   Trade in machinery&#13;
is especially sensitive to these iufluences, whether it is&#13;
office machinery exchanged aaong branches of a multinational&#13;
corporation in Brazil, Argentina and !1Gexico or textile&#13;
machinery traded among people of Chinese origin from Hong&#13;
Kong or Taiwan to (e.g.) Indonesia.&#13;
Country Concentration of Exports&#13;
Exports of msnufactures come mainly from a sumll number of devalop-&#13;
ing economies9 and the degree of concentration has not diminished over time0&#13;
If anything it has increased recently due to rapid export growth from Korea,&#13;
Taiwan, and Hong Kong' between them they accounted for over1 48% of the&#13;
total in 1976 compared to 43% in 1974. But ovea in 1974, seven middle-income&#13;
economies supplied over 70% of the total.&#13;
The reasons for this concentration age probably to be founded in&#13;
1) the small number of developing countries that have practiced export-&#13;
prowoting policies and avoided a strong bias o£ incentives aSainst exports&#13;
of manufactures for a sustained period9 2) thts liited number of developing&#13;
couneries that nave the commrcial and industrial experience9 umnagerial&#13;
knownhow, skills, educational levels, politlical stability, institutional&#13;
infrastructure, transport and cougmnications facilities9 etc0, to become&#13;
successful exporters without mch help from foreign corporations (whether&#13;
manufacturers or buyers), and 3) a convergence of views among businesses&#13;
in developed countries based partly on follow-theQleader, risk-averse be-&#13;
havior and partly on low wages, regarding preferable sources and industrial&#13;
locations in developing countriesKoreae, Taizan, and Hong Kong generally&#13;
qualify on all counts0&#13;
In anv case, the leading exporters in 1965 and 1975 were as&#13;

Southern Europe and are not far fromA being devz.loped countries by many&#13;
indicators, while others such as Taiwan, Korea and Brazil are beginning to&#13;
achieve remarkably versatile and flezible industrial capabilities, so that&#13;
they9 too, can be expected to reach the ranks of the industrialized countries&#13;
in the not-too-distant future0  Obviously   zpaorts of 2snufactures come minly&#13;
from the most industrialized and versatile developing economies.&#13;
Similar concentration has exis ted all along:  three economies sup-&#13;
plied over half of the total in 1965. On the whole, statistics for leading&#13;
exporters attest to the powerful momsntum that can be achi@aved in exporting&#13;
manufactures if policies remain favorable and countries build on their&#13;

Domination in Many Product Groups by "Powerhouse" Middle-Income Exporters&#13;
Exports come mainly from a few experienced and relatively advanced&#13;
economies, especially in the more complex products and in finished manufactures&#13;
where product design and delivery must be closely tailored to customer demand,&#13;
as in clothing or shoes. By contrast, the less developed and smaller exporters&#13;
do relatively better in standardized semi-finished products, such as textiles,&#13;
chemicals, leather, and a wide range of (other) processed natural-resource&#13;
products.&#13;
These contrasts can be illustrated statistically by defining eight&#13;
"powerhouse" middle-income exporters with relatively great industrial and/or&#13;
exporting experience--Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Yugoslavia, Brazil, Mexico,&#13;
Singapore and Argentina (in approximate order of their 1976 exports excluding&#13;
reexports). The following table shows the shares of the top three and six&#13;
suppliers from among these eight, in selected product groups for which data&#13;
are convenient. The one other country that is often a significant exporter&#13;
even in the complex products in India; its share is also shown in the table&#13;
for comparison.&#13;

As these and other data shou   the  ost succesaful export diver-&#13;
sification has been achieved in a swall handful og developing countries&#13;
which are nou approaching transitional statuo. In this regard it uy be&#13;
imporrant to remember that the ranks of ths developed countries havz&#13;
broadened to take in seveeal new mewbers in the lavt 25 yavs. The "powaer&#13;
house" exporters are among the leadanRS candid-tc  to joint these ranks&#13;
next. Further analysis would show that structKral changos in     :'cji f have&#13;
also continued at an impressive pace in traVnnWtonal Countries and those&#13;

Another way to look at the situation is to define developing&#13;
countries narrowly to exclude 1) all markct ecconRieds with per capita GNP&#13;
above $19300 in 1975 and 2) four countries under that level with relatively&#13;
developed industrial sectors:   Brazil, Nerico, Taiauz and Koreza  I/ As a&#13;
minor point, to add further realism, uncut diamonds (orth nearly S0O25&#13;
billion9 practically all from Africa) can be excluded; they find their way&#13;
into the usual definition (SITC 5-8 less 68) through a quirk in the trade&#13;
statisticso  Some of the other "amnufactures" also counted up to nowb aeX&#13;
also simple natural resource products, particularly in chemicals9 but no&#13;
further adjustment is made for thema&#13;
Based on this more arrow definition of developinag countries,&#13;
exports of manufactures (without uncut diaymnds) totalled only abouat $ 703&#13;
billion in 1974 and $8o5 billion in 1976 as follows;&#13;

For this narrower definition (in which India is still the big&#13;
industrial exporter) the growth of these exports has been slower than for&#13;
the wider definition, about 9.3% per year from 1965-74, thanks to sluggish&#13;
growth in South Asia. In other regions the growth in real terms has been&#13;
remarkable, in'the order of 15.5% per year.&#13;
Exports from these countries are predominantly semi-finished and&#13;
simple products. Among the top twelve suppliers in this group, textiles&#13;
made up 36.3% of their exports of manufactures and clothing 9.7%. By way&#13;
of comparison, for the eight "powerhouse" middle-income countries discussed&#13;
earlier, clothing comprised 17.4% of exports and textiles only 11.1%.&#13;
Exoorts of Manufactures by Income Level&#13;
Further analysis shows a very strong relationship between per&#13;
capita exports of manufactures and income levels; as part of this relation-&#13;
ship, exports of manufactures are practically nonexistent in countries at&#13;
the lowest income levels.&#13;
To study this relationship systematically it has been found use-&#13;
ful to use OECD countries imports of manufactures from developing countries&#13;
as a measure of the latter's export performance, because national export&#13;
data tend to be unreliable, unavailable or out of date in the less industrial&#13;

The relationships illustrated in chis table raise tantalizing&#13;
questions. How much developmsnt is necessary befoore exports of ianufac-&#13;
tures begin to "take off" successfully?   Does experience provide a fair test&#13;
since the low-incoms countries have biased their policies against exports?&#13;
Would India (not to mention Sri Lanka) be already out of the ranks of the&#13;
lov-incom countries if it had pursued erport-promoting polciies? This seems&#13;
not at all unlikely, especially since export performance has much to do with&#13;
exchange rates which in turn help to set GNP levels In international compari-&#13;
sons. Where would Korea be in GNP per head if it had followed policies&#13;
similar to those in India or Sri Lanka?&#13;
Looking at the numbers country by country, Haiti appears the most&#13;
encouraging example of a low-income country doing well, with $93 million in&#13;
exports of manufactures to OECD countries in 1974. Its location doubtless&#13;
helps, but it is also almost the only very poov country that has strongly&#13;
promoted these exports. However, none of the Sub-Saharan African countries&#13;
has achieved much in the way of exports of manufactures to OECD countries,&#13;
not even those with middle-level incomeso&#13;
The relationship between GNP per head and exports of Lmnufactures&#13;
to OECD per head turns out to be very strongly significant in log-linear&#13;
regressions taking individual countries as the observations0 Interestingly,&#13;
for developing countries with $120 to $1,200 per capita GNP, a dummy variable&#13;
for population over 15 million is also 2osit±vel   related to exports of&#13;
manufactures per head despite the usual negative relationship between trade&#13;
dependence and country size0 1/ This fact amnng others suggests that large&#13;
economies of scale (and cumulative experience) of one kind or another in&#13;
production, exporting and related activities, are involved in successful&#13;
exports of manufactures0 2/ These econowies of scale and experience may&#13;
occur at least as much in managerial, marketing and related functions-&#13;
information gathering, technology acquisition and improvewmat, product design,&#13;
quality control, risk taking, financial operations, etc0     as in production0&#13;
I/   These regression findings will be reported at some point in the future0&#13;
As explanatory variables, population density (positive effect) and a&#13;
dummy for oil exports (negative effect) can also be added but improve-&#13;
ments ia results are mainor.&#13;
2/   The cases of Hong Kong, Singapore, etc., do not rule this out for three&#13;
reasons0 First, large multinational corporations have played a central&#13;
role in successful exports from economies smaller than Hong Kong's0&#13;
Second, Hong Kong and Singapore embody ;ech "hidden" experience from&#13;
the pre-revolutionary industrialization of China and from the entrepot&#13;
trade, which involved exporting of manufactures0 Third, Hong Kong's&#13;
success has been built in large part around the marketing and intermediary&#13;
efforts of some veryr large exzBritish colonial trading companies&#13;
(Jardine Miatheson, ecc0) and other large businesses, of European&#13;
and Chinese ownershipo  In this and perhaps other ways (e.g., overseas&#13;
and China connections, GNP of $705 billion in 1975), Hong Kong is not so&#13;
small 1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
Whether a developing economy can take advantage of these economies probably&#13;
depends on how its enterprises are organized as much as on its size.&#13;
Export Price Trends for Developing Countries' Manufactures&#13;
There are no reliable overall indexes of the prices received by&#13;
developing countries for their exports of manufactures. The UN has recently&#13;
produced a unit value index for their manufactured exports broadly defined&#13;
(SITC 5-8), but the series appears to be dominated by trends in nonferrous&#13;
metals and other standardized processed commodities. For what the numbers are&#13;
worth, the index for developing countries compares to that for developed&#13;
countries as follows, dropping sharply in 1975.&#13;

There are grounds for suspecting that textiles, clothing, elec-&#13;
tronics and other labor-intensive specialties of developing countries have&#13;
declined in price relative to other manufactures in both sets of countries, in&#13;
the 1960's and 1970's alike. This may come about not only because of ease of&#13;
entry, fierce price competition, and technological advances, but also because&#13;
there has been a shift over time toward locations with cheaper labor, first&#13;
in the developed countries and then in the developing ones. Another reason&#13;
may be that through learning, scale economies and "catch up" processes, costs&#13;
fall especially rapidly in developing economies at certain phases in the&#13;
development process particularly when exports from manufacturing industries&#13;
are expanding rapidly.&#13;
Evidence for declining relative prices in developing countries'&#13;
exports come in part from wholesale price indexes of the developed countries.&#13;
Textile prices have lagged behind other prices everywhere. 1/ In the United&#13;
States the wholesale price of apparel rose only 47.1% in nearly thirty years&#13;

equipment, for example, have declined absolutely through the 1970's.&#13;

The other main evidence comes from a few leading exporters of manu-&#13;
factures. Their unit value and terms of trade indexes have fluctuated quite&#13;
differently from those of leading developed country exporters of manufactures0&#13;
One reason for this is almost certainly the t&amp;orldwide price competition through&#13;
which prices are typically determined by demand and supply, and ultimately by&#13;
costs in low-cost sources of supply, 2mh as in priEary commodities0 Prices&#13;
become depressed in a recession as suppliers coapete to stay in business and&#13;
hold onto market shares even if this means operating without profits: U.S.&#13;
textile producers (among others) took large losses in 1975. 2/ These price&#13;
patterns contrast sharply with those in many other manufacturing industries&#13;
where administered prices prevail and are raised in the face of an inflation&#13;
and recession together. However, there have been significant differences&#13;
in the patterns of price increases in individual economies.&#13;

One other implication of these series is that the growth rates in&#13;
the volume of developing countriesD exports o0 mnu actures, other than non-&#13;
ferrous metals9 may have been even higher then Tables 3 and 6 above would&#13;
imply, to mske up for declining terms of trade relative to developed coun-&#13;
tries manufactures0&#13;
Developed Countries' Import Growth by Product Grou&#13;
Developed countries' rapid Import grozsh from the developing couna&#13;
tries9 and the latter's successful diversification of exports9 can be illus-&#13;
trated by the following table. In the svevn years from 1967 to 1974 the&#13;
developing countries made enormous strides in exporting to thae developed&#13;
countries. Clothing and electronic exports led the way but there were&#13;
strong gains in other products as well0   En real terws the volumE of these&#13;
trade flows must have nearly quadrupled withi2 this seveonyear period0&#13;
In electronics the growth mast have been roughly twenty-fold, in clothing&#13;
about seven-fold0  Nominal dollar values grew by ten tieso or more in foote&#13;
'eear, nonelectrical machinery, transport equipment, instruments and other&#13;
metal products0&#13;
This rapid growth of exports aimesd directly at the developed coun-&#13;
tries' markets would surely not have been possible without strenuous efforts&#13;
by businesses from these countries themselves, to overcome the supply&#13;
barriers .&#13;
Even if this and the other broad explanations already put forward&#13;
are correct9 much remains to be explained and better understood in regard&#13;
to 1) the timing of this growth9 i.e., special reasons for a "bunching' of&#13;
export expansion and industry shifting into a short period from 1966 or 1967&#13;
to 1973 or 19749 and 2) the particular selection of industrial processes&#13;
that moved0  This last is all the more intriguing because within the&#13;
engineering sectors a mjority of the export increase came from a narrow&#13;
selection of manual assembly processes0 Principal among these were the&#13;
assembly of sewiconductors and other electronic components and the assembly&#13;
stages of production in a swall number of electronic products headed by TV&#13;
sets and radios0 I/&#13;
In regard to the timing of this big expansion push9 several&#13;
points are worth noting0 They have to do ainly gith the timing of influ=-&#13;
ences that have already been mentioned0&#13;
(1) The process would hardly have gone so far without the&#13;
strong export-promotion efforts in Taiwan and Korea&#13;
throughout the 1960's and the creation of Nexican&#13;
border zones9 not to mention other e2port-oriented policy&#13;
shifts in developing countries in the mid and late 1960's0&#13;
/   Evidence is given in an unpublished study by Phi Anh Plesch on develop°&#13;
tng countrtes' exports of electronics and electrical machinery0&#13;

(2)  Trade liberalization in the developed countries received a&#13;
Emjor further impetus in the later 1960's and early 1970's,&#13;
with the Kennedy Round tariff cuts1, offshore assembly provisions&#13;
in UOSO and some European tariffs, and a generally very favorable&#13;
policy environments for imports from developing countries (pre-&#13;
ference schemes were enacted, etc.), solidifying and reakfirv=&#13;

(5)  It is difficult to avoid an imprescia- thliat developments&#13;
internal to the electronics industry caused that industry&#13;
to search feverishly for low-wage locations for assembly&#13;
processes, beginning about 1967=68. By that tiwes integrated&#13;
circuits and other semiconductor devices, though not exactly&#13;
'gmature" products, had becoun standardized and a vigorous&#13;
price competition had broken out amng the many firim trying&#13;
According to a private coumnication from Bela Balassa, "beEween 1971 and&#13;
1976 manufacturing wages increased 46 percent in the United States, 130&#13;
percent in Taiwan, and 116 percent in Korea in ter-ms of U.S. dollars."&#13;

to stay in this promising industry. A fierce price-cutting&#13;
competition also emerged in consumer electronics, especially&#13;
in mass-output items such as transistor radios and TV sets.&#13;
The fluidity of the situation and the narrowness of profit&#13;
margins forced procedures to take bold risks to stay in the race.&#13;
This situation was almost certainly aggravated by cutbacks in U.S.&#13;
defense spending, first on technically sophisticated research and&#13;
later on weaponry: electronics companies lost much of their&#13;
military market.&#13;
Further clarification of why these processes moved and, more&#13;
important, which ones are moving now and are likely to move in future,&#13;
will have to await further research. 1/ On the whole this list carries&#13;
an impression that such export growth is likely to be more subdued in coming&#13;
years.&#13;
market Penetration in Developed Countries&#13;
Imports of manufactures by developed countries are still very small&#13;
relative to the size of the market. Even in clothing the developed countries'&#13;
combined market was at least $60 billion in 1973 (in prices somewhat inflated&#13;
by protection). 2/ Here by then the developing countries' share must have&#13;
been 6 to 7 percent.&#13;
In the industrial countries' markets for all manufactures combined,&#13;
the developing countries' share must have reached one percent for the first&#13;
time very recently, probably in 1976. In 1973, at world prices, developed&#13;
countries' gross output of manufactures, narrowly defined to match the trade&#13;
classification, must have been at least $1,900 billion. 3/ Apparent con-&#13;
sumption (gross output plus imports minus exports) was a little less, but&#13;
still probably over 100 times imports from developing countries of $17.4&#13;
billion. However, data are insufficient to permit a reliable comparison.&#13;
An indirect indicator of this market penetration is a ratio shown&#13;
in the next table, imports from developing countries as a percent of GNP.&#13;
Although GNP from manufactures, narrowly defined, would be around one fourth&#13;
1/   Some interview research in this general area is planned under a new&#13;
World Bank Research project, RPO 67-68, "Key Institution and the Expan-&#13;
sion of Manufactured Exports," although this research is more heavily&#13;
concerned with marketing and related aspects of exports by indigenous&#13;
firms.&#13;
2/   Gross output of clothing in these countries was about $56 billion&#13;
based on the industry statistic definition which is not the same as&#13;
(and on balance covers less than) the trade definition. Imports net&#13;
of exports were over $3 billion. The industry figure is from U.N.&#13;
Yearbook of Industrial Statistics, 1975.&#13;
3/   The main uncertainty here is now much European gross output data should&#13;
be adjusted upward to achieve an appropriate estimate of shipments.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
of GNP in a '"typical" industrial onxknt ecmoiory groes output and apparent&#13;
consuption of manufactures (being perhapo 207 tiw-ee output) would be about&#13;
two thirds of GNP0  Therefore the rneht ohare would generally be about&#13;
50% greater than the ratio shoon:   for enEple9, if iLporKt  are 006% of GLNP&#13;
they are probably equal to roughly 009Z of thke  rket fog wBnufactures0&#13;

In many individual products, the developing countries have achieved&#13;
a very significant penetration of the market. Conversely, however, in a vast&#13;
majority of manufactured products their share of the market is still only a&#13;
small fraction of-one percent.&#13;
Here are some examples of high market penetration. In cotton&#13;
fabrics by 1973, judging by data in metric tons, outside the U.S. (where the&#13;
share was about 6.3%) the developing countries had captured 12.1% of the&#13;
market in the developed countries; the highest shares were reached in the&#13;
UK (27.3%) and Netherlands (25.272). 1/    In black-and-white television sets,&#13;
imports- from all sources supplied 78% of the U.S. market by number of sets,&#13;
while imported radios were 89% of the total sold in 1974 according to the&#13;
Electronics Industry Association. 2/ The developing countries seem to have&#13;
supplied slightly over half of the total imports in these products. 3/ In&#13;
West Germany already by 1971 imports from the Far East (including Japan)&#13;
supplied 99% of all pocket radios and 18% of all portable radios sold. 4/&#13;
A Case Study in Market Penetration: Clothing and Textiles in the U.S. Market&#13;
As an illustrative case study of market penetration, it may be&#13;
useful to look more closely at the biggest case of all, imports of clothing&#13;
and other textile products into the U.S. market.    These imports reached&#13;
over $3.6 billion in 1976. 5/&#13;
Before looking at the numbers it is essential to summarize the&#13;
history of U.S. quantitative import restrictions (quotas) in these products.&#13;
From 1961 to 1971, imports of cotton textile products from developing coun-&#13;
tries and Japan were subject to bilateral quotas, but imports of textile&#13;
products made from other fibers were not restricted. As a result, developing&#13;
countries concentrated on exports of clothing made from man-made fibers&#13;
and (to a minor extent) wool. The U.S. reacted in March 1972 by negotiating&#13;

2/   Electronics Industries Association, Electronic Data Book, 1977 edition;&#13;
this apparently includes radios and TV sets imported in unfinished&#13;
form, and finished in the U.S..&#13;
3/   Judging by seven-digit U.S. import data cited in Phi Anh Plesch's un-&#13;
published study. In radios and television receivers the share was 52%;&#13;
in other television apparatus it was 78%.&#13;

bilateral  greeesnczs retroactive to October 1D 197l, first with a minor&#13;
supplier (Malaycia) and then with Japan, Hong Kong Korea and Taiuan.&#13;
These agreements set up quotas for all three fibers together0 This system&#13;
has since been in force with minor changes and has been entended to several&#13;
other suppliers.&#13;
As the nest table shows9 before this   easure was taken, imports of&#13;
textiles and apparel froma all sources grew rapidly from about 6G of the U.S.&#13;
market (by fiber weight) in 1964 to more than 9%Z Most of the increase came&#13;
in man=made fibers where the grouth was relentlosso   then the new three-fiber&#13;
quotas were introduced9 two asjor things happened. Host impovtant9 the&#13;
quantitative growth of imports was halted and their Emrket shared declined.&#13;
At the saws time   importEs shifted froa onn-aide fiber to cottoa textile&#13;
products, evidently because as a group, the East Asian suppliers had a larger&#13;
cost advantage in these products0&#13;

U.S. data also reveal market penetration patterns in some of the&#13;
leading products, based once again on data in physical units-this time&#13;
numbers of each item imported and produced. Imports have enjoyed their&#13;
greatest success in sweaters, shirts, blouses, coats and jackets, and a few&#13;
other items. Here again, however, the penetration process has been largely&#13;
halted since 1971.&#13;
Meanwhile, imports from developing countries have trended upward&#13;
both in value and as a share of total imports. Displacement of other sup-&#13;
pliers has been particularly striking in clothing, where imports from develop-&#13;
ing countries roughly doubled their share from 41% of the market in 1967 to&#13;
over 80% in 1976 and 1977.&#13;

As this table shows, in the nine years after 1967 the value of&#13;
clothing imports from developing countries grew in current dollars to eleven&#13;
times its initia-l level.  Since the U.S. pri-ce index for clothing only rose--&#13;
by 40% (as shown previously in Table 25)-, in "real" terms these imports&#13;
may have increased as much as eight-fold. In textiles "real" growth was&#13;
much slower, to about 1.5 times the initial level. Presumably the exporters&#13;
concentrated on clothing partly because there is a higher value added to&#13;
each "square yard equivalent" in the quota. It is also very interesting to&#13;
note that despite multifiber quotas, from 1971 to 1976 the current value of&#13;
clothing imports more than tripled.&#13;
It seems clear that these years witnessed a systematic upgrading&#13;
of developing countrv exports of textile products to the U.S. market. This&#13;
upgrading presumably included improvements in quality and in the mix of&#13;
exports, and additions-to the functions performed by indigenous enterprises&#13;
in producing, marketing and distributing garments. In the five year span&#13;
1971-76, the value of these exports rose 2.8 times.    Meanwhile, U.S. wholesale&#13;
prices rose by 24%. in clothing and a little more in other textile products;&#13;
the developing countries' share of the U.S. import market rose by somewhat&#13;
over one third; and the fiber weight of U.S. imports from all sources&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

The depressed. employment situation has been caused partly by trends&#13;
within manufacturing, which employs about one fourth of the labor force. For&#13;
all the developed countries together, employment in manufacturing totalled&#13;
nearly 70 million in 1973 and 1974, of whom over 60 million worked in manu-&#13;
facturing narrowly defined to correspond to the trade definition. 1/ In the&#13;
period 1965-74 employment in all manufacturing grew at 0.9% per year, held&#13;
back (in a sense) by labor productivity growth at 3.8% per year. For leading&#13;
branches the employment and productivity trends were as follows.&#13;
1/   With South Africa and transitional countries excluded the larger total   t&#13;
would be roughly 65 million, based on data from UN Yearbook of Industrial&#13;

As this table helps to show, employment in textiles as distinct&#13;
from clothing declined throughout this period. 1/ This downtrend appears&#13;
to have been caused by sluggish demand and exceptionally high productivity&#13;
growth, due to technical changes involving automation, reorganization, new&#13;
equipment and new fibers and fabrics. Imports cannot be blamed for the&#13;
sluggish demand since throughout the period, the developed countries have&#13;
maintained a strong positive trade balance in textiles (SITC 65), despite&#13;
net imports in certain products and countries. 2/ Similarly in food products&#13;
and basic metals the effects of increased imports from developing countries&#13;
have been unimportant. However, increased imports from poorer countries have&#13;
seriously aggravated the situation in clothing, footwear and leather products,&#13;
where employment began to trend downward from 1970, despite exceptionally slow&#13;
labor productivicy growth, and then dropped sharply in 1975.&#13;
For an incomplete set of developing countries for which numbers are&#13;
available, manufacturing employment fell from 66.9 million in 1974 to 63.5&#13;
million in 1975 and 63.4 million in 1976. 3/ Employment in 1976 was above&#13;
the 1975 level in North America, but below it in Western Europe and slightly&#13;
below it in Japan and Australia. Branches suffering downtrends prior to 1974&#13;
appear to have been especially hard-hit. In Europe rapidly increasing&#13;
imports of clothing contributed significantly to-the job layoffs.&#13;
Employment Effects of Imports from Developing Countries&#13;
Although precise estimates are difficult to make, it is clear that&#13;
the number of jobs eliminated in developed countries, as a result of imports&#13;
from developing countries, has been small relative to the layoffs caused by&#13;
technical progress and faltering demand. For example, in West Germany about&#13;

This is at least 20 timzs gveater than the iWact og imports from developing&#13;
countries in any year up to now, judging by etizmte2 given below.&#13;
Indeed, the net coploymant imact of these imports is not neces-&#13;
sarily negative at all. In the first place, the developing countries gener'&#13;
ally spend the proceeds, adding to employweag in developed countriezs e%port&#13;
industries0 Secondly, under norml policy conditious, the Srowth of trade&#13;
leads to an increzse of real incowme, which in turn causes expanded demand in&#13;
both the public and the private nectors.   If this second 5mchanism is not&#13;
operating properly, however, the nGt job impact will generally be negative,&#13;
because iWorts displace low-uage jobs involving relative aore workers, while&#13;
an equivalent valge of enports creates higheK-uaGe jobs in sa9ller numbers0&#13;
Even so9 the net employment loss in considerably less than the gross displace-&#13;
ment.&#13;
As an order of magnitude, available inforvmtion suggests that&#13;
gross cumulative displacemsnt of jobs in developed countries9 as a result&#13;
of imports of manufactures from developing councries, must have been in the&#13;
order of one mdllion jobs through 19769 or perhaps slightly mare0 No one&#13;
has objected to a rough estiemted in an earlier szudy that in 1975 prices, at&#13;
least 520,000 worth of imports would be required to displace one worker0 I/&#13;
After all9 the value added equivalent would probably be $7-890009 of which&#13;
wages would constitute-at most $5-690009 which on average was no mre than one&#13;
year's unskilled wages in the major importing countries. Developed countries'&#13;
imports from developing countries mst have been somewhere in the range from&#13;
$27T30 billion in 19769 in 1975 prices (slightly more in currgent prices), so&#13;
that by this rule groso cumulative job displacevnnt could have been as hiigh as&#13;
105 million ($30 billion divided by $20,000)0   However, ir is likely that the&#13;
ratio of $20,9000 of imports for0 one job would only hold true in the most&#13;
low-skiled, labor-'intenive manufactures such as clothing, cotton textileo,&#13;
footwear and electronic assembly products. As an ovegall average teakin   other&#13;
types of imports into account, it probably requires at least $25,000 in&#13;
imports to displace one job. Thus the total displacement is probably not umch&#13;
over one million. 2/&#13;
Against this must be s(et soE estiwate of the jobs created in ezO&#13;
ports. Total enports of mqanufactures to developing countrree are several&#13;
tims larger than imports from them (see Asnex A) amd undoubtedly involve&#13;
1/   World Bah, Trade Li beration and Export PromoEtion, 1977.&#13;
2/   This estiwmte would appear roughly consisteut with the estimate cited&#13;
by Uolter for West Germany, and Tith an estifmte for the U.S. that&#13;
14,000 jobs per year were displaced direczly by rapid import growth&#13;

many more jobs than are lost to the imports. Even in their trade with&#13;
developing countries of Asia (other than the Middle East), the richer coun-&#13;
tries' exports of manufactures are over twice their imports. But, of course,&#13;
most exports to developing countries are made possible by developed country&#13;
imports of fuels and other primary commodities, rather than manufactures.    For&#13;
their imports of manufactures alone, if it is assumed that one job was created&#13;
directly through added exports for every two jobs lost through imports, the&#13;
cumulative effect of these imports over many years must have been to eliminate&#13;
in the order of half a million manufacturing jobs. This would be not quite 1X&#13;
of the total number of manufacturing jobs in developing countries as of 1974,&#13;
and would put the effect in the range of 3-4% of the total unemployment of&#13;
15-16 million since 1975. 1/ Viewed slightly differently, half a million&#13;
workers would be. less than 0.2% of the total labor force in developed countries.&#13;
This does not take into account more indirect employment effects,&#13;
which would probably be positive or neutral on balance. They would occur in&#13;
several ways. First, there would be employment changes in industries supply-&#13;
ing imports into the export and import-competing industries. Here it is&#13;
difficult to guess which inputs would be more labor-intensive. Second, there&#13;
would be multiplier effects around the shrinking and expanding industries.&#13;
Jobs would be created indirectly in the vicinity of the successful export&#13;
industries, and diminished in the vicinity of plants forced to close as a&#13;
result of imports. Again the next effect is unclear. 2/ Finally if "macro"&#13;
policy instruments are working properly, the higher income made possible&#13;
through efficient specialization would presumably lead to greater investment,&#13;
public expenditures, etc., offsetting any negative net effect at the "micro"&#13;
level. Even if policy instruments work badly there may be some net effect&#13;
in this direction. 3/&#13;
Whatever may have been the total effects, the negative effects have&#13;
been centered in a few industries. In clothing, total employment in develop-&#13;
ing countries was about 3.5 million in 1973-less if one excludes the Southern&#13;
European countries (Italy, Spain, etc.) where market penetration has been&#13;
1/   Counting France and other coutnries not included in Table 33 above.&#13;
2/   Possibly the high-wage machinery exports work spends less and saves&#13;
more of his income than the low-wage clothing worker left jobless, so&#13;
that fewer jobs are created until the savings are invested. But higher&#13;
incomes also lead at the margin to higher consumption of services,&#13;
which may be more labor-intensive that production of goods; and the&#13;
displaced worker may still spend out of (2.g.) unemployment compensa-&#13;
tion.&#13;
3/   This is admittedly an intuitive and fuzzy argument.   However, analyzing&#13;
the interaction of micro and macro-forces is not one of the areas in&#13;
which modern economics is crystal clear and operationally reliable,&#13;
so that the difficulty may not lie entirely with the author's analytical&#13;
deficiencies.&#13;

expanded rapidly, especially in Euvope, so thzt t.he cumulative number of jobs&#13;

industries, notably those producing mschinery and equipment0&#13;
An unprecedently large employment egfect mEust have occurred in the&#13;
year 1976. Imports from developing countgies jumped in constant 1975 prices&#13;
by somethina like $6 billion to $8 billionz, probably displacing 300,000 to&#13;
4001,000 workers in one year0  The net d plaeQment must have beea at least&#13;
150,,000 jobs0  This would mean that about 1% of the unemaployed yorkers were&#13;
unable to find jobs in the depressed labov mrket, of 1976, due to these&#13;
added imports. Another fractiou of 1% uould havc found jobs, if imports&#13;
from developing countries have stayed at their 1973 peegecession levels&#13;
instead of growing in both 1974 and 19750 Por the three years direct gross&#13;
labor displacement 9mst haw beea at least 3% of the peak uneWloyment, with&#13;
net displacement much smaller0&#13;
In political terms this groes eff:ect my be more important than the&#13;
net effect0  After all,, workers displaced may sell be aware of the role of&#13;
imports in eliminating their jobso   Other e'orhers Esy also blame imorts&#13;

other reasons (falling domestic degmand) after being under pressure from&#13;
imports , and where jobs were lost that appeared indirectly linked to in-&#13;
dustries closed by imports,9 for example, in towns hurt by factory closings.&#13;
By contrast, DorkemS whose jobs uere savzd by the vesulting exports uould&#13;

The direct plus indirect employment effects of export of manu-&#13;
factures from developing countries are larger and more generally positive than&#13;
the job displacement effects in the developed countries. Reasons include the&#13;
following:&#13;
(1)  In developing countries export demand tends to be a&#13;
positive addition to total aggregate demand. Thus,&#13;
the jobs created are additional to those needed to&#13;
meet domestic demand. Added jobs are created indirectly&#13;
by increased demand for inputs, and multiplier effects&#13;
are generated as workers spend their wages. The result-&#13;
ing foreign exchange earnings lead in many cases to&#13;
additional investment linked with imported equipment,&#13;
creating jobs in construction. As output comes on&#13;
stream from the investments, demand expands further.&#13;
Of course, there are also leakages: added imports&#13;
are required to provide inputs for the exports, and&#13;
consumer goods are purchased abroad along with investment&#13;
goods. But these merely help to limit the expansion.&#13;
(2)  The number of jobs created directly is larger than the&#13;
number displaced in developed countries, to the extent&#13;
that labor productivity is lower in developing countries&#13;
so that more workers are required to produce the same&#13;
output. Here the picture is mixed and varies from one&#13;
exporting region to another.' In some "offshore assembly"&#13;
plants multinational companies find productivity higher&#13;
than in their home countries, and in others it may&#13;
be about the same. Yet in many auxiliary tasks such as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ingapgant tr    sortationz  m Tg2eturers find it economical&#13;
to substitute labor for capital equipwnst, and frequently&#13;
local plants cannot match developed country standards of&#13;
efficiency.  In eztreme cases such as handlooma tentiles,&#13;
exports are produced using non-factory methods with very low&#13;
productivity.&#13;
(3)  In addition to exports to developed COUntrieS, one ca  perhaps&#13;
count employment generated by exKporto to other Emrkets, in-l&#13;
cluding other developing countries0&#13;
There have been attetes to estimate the eaployb3msnt effects in&#13;
individual economies such as Korea and Taiwan, suggesting that the effects&#13;
have been in the order of one million or unre jobs in each0 1/ All such&#13;
estimates are hedged with numerous qualificationSo&#13;
For the developing countries as a group, it seex2s likely that&#13;
direct additions to factory employmnnt have been in the order of 2 or at&#13;
most 3 million 2/==not a smsll number cowpared to about 25 million factory&#13;
workers in all developing countries0 This is roughly confirmed by recall-&#13;
ing by way of comparison an estimate earlier (in Table 6 above) that in&#13;
19739 10% of developing countries' manufactures were exported0   Since thea&#13;
the proportion has been rising0&#13;
The number of jobs created is clearly very smnll relative to the&#13;
total labor force in developing countries0 Even if one takes into account&#13;
all the multiplier effects and the handloom weavegs and construction workers9&#13;
1/   With the help of input-output tables9 Wan-=yong KuoD in "Sources of&#13;
Industrial Growth and Structural Change in Taiwan9 ROC,` NIay 1977D&#13;
Table 199 estimates Taiwan's ewploymant in all sectors due to all&#13;
types of exports at 3409000 in 1961, 714D000 in 1966 and 191389000 in&#13;
1971  For the kmnufacturing sector alone her estigmteS are 929000 in&#13;
1961, 208,000 in 1966 and 518,000 in 1971O Nanufactured exports have&#13;
increasingly predominated. David C0 Cole and Larry Eo Westphal, in&#13;
"The Contribution of Exports to Employm-ent in South Korpaa,` mimesoO,&#13;
January 1975, use an input-output table to estimasts employwent as a&#13;
result of Korea's anufactured expgots valued at $646 million in 1970o&#13;
They found direct employment of 2259000 plus indirect employment of&#13;
293,000 (including 67,000 manufacturing jobs) for a total of 518,000&#13;
including 292,000 in manufacturing0 Given the huge absolute increases&#13;
in exports in both economies (Koreas grew in value over ten times fromE&#13;
1970 through 1976) these estimates imply gach larger numbers today0&#13;
2/   Within industries output per worker is almost certainly above average&#13;
in export=oriented plancs9 at least when valued at wiorld prices, al°&#13;
though this may be offset by exports being concentrated in the most&#13;
labor-intensive branches. Labor productivity on average is probably&#13;
at least half that of developed country industries displaced0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
probably in the order of 5 to 10 million jobs have been created, adding&#13;
perhaps 1% to total employment in a labor force of several hundred million. 1/&#13;
These job-creating effects must have been concentrated in a few geographic&#13;
regions--East and South Asia, and few parts of Latin America and the Mediter-&#13;
ranean.&#13;
What Causes Protectionism Today?&#13;
The above analysis suggests a few possible reasons why mounting&#13;
pressures of protectionism are triggered in developed countries by imports&#13;
from developing countries, even though their shares in overall markets for&#13;
manufactures remain very small. The imports have been known to expand&#13;
rapidly in narrow product lines, and are felt to have significant employment&#13;
impact, more than they do in fact, particularly in a depressed labor market.&#13;
No doubt an extrapolation of their rapid growth can be quite frightening&#13;
for industrialists and employees in the threatened industries.&#13;
Other influences may also be at work. Of these the following&#13;
are particularly noteworthy.&#13;
(1) Unions and threatened manufacturing industries are&#13;
upset by the combined effects of technical progress&#13;
(particularly automation), slow demand growth, profit&#13;
squeezes, and increased imports from all sources.&#13;
Imports from developing countries are one of the few&#13;
irritants for which relief can be successfully sought,&#13;
under the rules of the game.&#13;
(2) Even where penetration rules are not high, the penetra-&#13;
tion normally comes in the most price-sensitive and&#13;
price-competitive manufacturing products where there&#13;
may be a strong price effect holding down wages and&#13;
profits. It is striking in this regard that textile&#13;
and apparel prices have declined strongly compared&#13;
to other prices, as have electronics prices. For the&#13;
economy as a whole, there may be significant wage and&#13;
price-depressing effects as a result of the links&#13;
among markets, especially for unskilled-labor.&#13;
1/   Confirming that this is no exaggeration of the order of magnitude,&#13;
William G. Tyler, in "Manufactured Exports and Employment Creation in&#13;
Developing Countries: Some Empirical Evidence," Economic Development&#13;
and Cultural Change, January 1976, presents estimates derived from&#13;
input-output tables of eight countries (India, Egypt, Taiwan, Yugoslavia,&#13;
Mexico, South Korea, Brazil, Philippines) totalling 5,141,000 for dates&#13;
ranging from 1960 to 1970, based on direct and indirect employment to&#13;
'produce exports of manufactAres. -His estimates -of 516,000 for Taiwan&#13;
(1969) and 309,000 for Koyea (1968) are conservative compared to those&#13;
cited above; but he finds much larger employment effects in India&#13;
(2,181,000 in 1964/65) /and Egypt (932,000 in 1969/70).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(3)  Labor displacement effects are greater thn panetration&#13;
rates because the sccessful peneration comes in the&#13;
most laborxineensive products and displaces the osiot labor-&#13;
intensive proceeses. Some of the 8fgted labor farce is&#13;
not only poor but poorly organized, hence not very effective&#13;
politically, but unionized plants are strongly affected&#13;
and can make their case besed on the social impact on people&#13;
who are unskilled and hve nowhere else to go.&#13;
(4)  Geographically the induztries affected are widely disbursed&#13;
and are important in the local econscalc   of lmany of the towns&#13;
in which they are found, hence they cam zeert pressrtwe through&#13;
ntuerous political Heprsetaties         aving started in the&#13;
cities (clozhing) or suburbs (electroiics) they have partly&#13;
moved out to small towas in loUwaae rUral areas0&#13;
(5)  The current unve of protectionisE   is directed mainly against&#13;
Japan and a handful of the most successful developing country&#13;
exporters headed by Korea, Taitan, and Hong Kong, followed by&#13;
Brazil. These economies are no longer viewed as waak and&#13;
backward0 The strength of the pressure is caused by the&#13;
recognition that the East Asian countries near Japan are&#13;
now emerging as formidable competitors. Except in textiles&#13;
there is 11-ttle thought of restricting the smaller developing&#13;
country exporters, unless they are used am bases for ezports&#13;
by Japan and the others.&#13;
(6) The rising protectionist wave is in large measture a reaction&#13;
against trade liberalization in devcloped countries, a process&#13;
that has gone surprisingly far since the 1950's.&#13;
Trends in Protection&#13;
From the 1950's up to the 1975 recession there has been a clear&#13;
trend toward reduced protection. Tariff cuts in the Dillon and (especially)&#13;
Kennedy Rounds bit quite deep, bringing waighted-average nominal tariffs&#13;
on finished and semi-finished industrial products doun to a range of 8 to 9&#13;
percent. 1/   The Tokyo Round might ell cut the level by 2 or 3 points more&#13;
over the next ten years0   KDst of the tariff cuts have been binding and&#13;
irreversible0 Meanwhile, the European Cowmunity has been extended, and&#13;
acquired several types of associate mmbersD, So that almost all of Wasterna&#13;
Europe has or will soon have tariff-free trea@ent along with a long list&#13;
of developing countries0 At the same tioe, the United States and West&#13;
Germany, among others, have created spccial off-shore assembly provisions&#13;

was 25b in clothing, based on GATT computations0&#13;

- 59 -&#13;
in their tariffs giving duty-free treatment to the value of components produced&#13;
in the importing country but assembled abroad. All the major industrial&#13;
countries have adopted Generalized System of Preference schemes, giving&#13;
duty-free treatment to many products from developing countries, though some of&#13;
these countries are usually excluded. Japan has undergone a major liberali-&#13;
zation of its imports, leading to a rapid rise in imports from developing&#13;
countries starting from a low base.&#13;
By 1975, not only tariff barriers but also nontariff barriers were&#13;
weak. In the developed countries as a group, outside textile products about&#13;
one and-half percent of all imports of manufactures (narrowly defined) from&#13;
developing countries were subiect to quantitative import restrictions. 1/&#13;
In leading industrial countries, protective'nontariff barriers were practic-&#13;
ally absent (with only minor products affected) except for a residual of&#13;
administrative and special obstacles which were most serious in Italy and&#13;
France. 2/  Ever since trade within Europe became liberalized, these special&#13;
obstacles have included bilateral quotas limiting a number of specific&#13;
imports from Japan. The Japanese are used to such discriminatory treatment&#13;
and export successfully despite it. In their country, the Japanese claim in&#13;
turn to have practically no quantitative restrictions in manufactures narrowly&#13;
defined except in footwear and leather products. 3/ Other developed countries&#13;
encounter difficulties in selling manufactures in Japan, but the problems&#13;
appear to center in marketing, customer preferences, financial arrangements&#13;
and links among firms more than in administrative barriers created by the&#13;
government.&#13;
Textille products up to 1976 presented a mixed picture. In most&#13;
developed countries other than the United States, up to'1976 or 1977 quanti-&#13;
tative restrictions-under the Multifiber Arrangement (MEA) remained quite&#13;
incomplete and not very effective except in narrow product categories. Most&#13;
European countries did not fully use their powers under MFA, but allowed a&#13;
rapid increase in imports. Even in the United States, as earlier tables show,&#13;
a considerable increase took place in the value of imports -of textiles and&#13;
clothing, despite serious quota regulations.&#13;
In addition to not being fully applied, the MFA in its early year&#13;
had a permissive side that helps to explain the agreement by developing&#13;

The New Wave of Protectionism&#13;
Recently9 since about 1975076, in the wsods of the World Bak's&#13;
World Development Rpoort 1978 (p. 15)9 'Thege has been a marked increase in&#13;
protectionism and pressures for further    asures age stron     .  The protec'&#13;
tionist measures have entailed the use of a wide vagiety of devices9 for&#13;
example, 'orderly marketing arrangemonts and new iRport quotas; price&#13;
floors on imports, as in the case of steel and agricultural products; new&#13;
'voluntary' export restraints; 'couutearvrilinx dugti,es-'  adEinDstrative&#13;
obstacles to imports; and subsidies to domestic industries to sustain levels&#13;
of production in excess of those justified by demand0   There have been&#13;
calls for the control of msrket shares on a reglimal or uorldwide basis and&#13;
for extending protection to a widgr arrny of productgs0"&#13;
This new wave of protectimism has been setrongest   n Europe9&#13;
but has been felt in almost all the developed countries0 Emcepe in a few&#13;
industries=oteiles, footwear9 and clothing in perticularKthese neu&#13;
barriers up to now have been aimed mors ag Japan than at developing coun-&#13;
tries.  However, all outside competition has been hurt by large subsidies in&#13;
several European countries to these industrias and to others such as steel&#13;
and shipbuilding, aimed at waintaining e   loyc&#142;   despite large losmes,&#13;
which have been charged to the taxpayers0 Kozazyhile9 in actuality og in&#13;
threat, a number of restrictive mzeures are bLuEi aimld at developing&#13;
countries9 mainly at taiwan, Korea9 HongS Kog   and/or Brazxil&#13;
Up to now the most serious of theso new reotrictions9 from the&#13;
point of view of the developing countries9 have c ome ia te2=tilss and clothing.&#13;
Here the European CoEaon Narket has imposed new quotas for the years 1978&#13;
through 1982 that "do not wsrely limit ggroth bUt actually reduce imWort&#13;
levels.  For three leading suppliers (the Republic og Chiain, Hong Kong, and&#13;
the Republic of Korea)9 quotas for 1970 are well below their actual 1976&#13;
trade levels in several major product eategories0 All the soiaificant and&#13;
potentially significant exzporters have seen their SCope fog eKpanding&#13;
exports severely restricted by quotas that grow only slowly froa past trade&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

levels, usually by between 0.5 percent and 4 percent a year, compared with&#13;
the previous norm of 6 percent per year. The new agreements also establish&#13;
low "trigger levels" for further quotas that limit the scope for diversifi-&#13;
cation of exports into new products. Restrictive new quotas have been&#13;
imposed by other importing countries such as Australia, Canada, Norway, and&#13;
Sweden, while the United States, in its new bilateral agreements, has held&#13;
the quotas of its largest suppliers at the same level in 1978 as in 1977." 1/&#13;
Already in 1977-78, as a result of the new protectionist measures, developing&#13;
country exports of textiles and clothing appear to be flat or down in real&#13;
terms, and are losing market shares, while prices of. import-competing&#13;
products have been boosted in developed countries. 2/ As a result, according&#13;
to field interviews, investments in these industries are being cancelled or&#13;
cut back in some of the poorer developing countries.&#13;
Meanwhile, in footwear new quantitative restrictions against&#13;
leading developing country suppliers have been imposed, among other places,&#13;
in Australia, Canada, France and the United Kingdom, and orderly marketing&#13;
agreements have been negotiated by the United States. In steel, the United&#13;
States has gone over to a system of minimum import prices, making it very&#13;
difficult for developing country exporters to break into the U.S. market.&#13;
The European Community is in transition from a temporary system of minimum&#13;
trigger prices to a quota system. There have been increases in European&#13;
restrictions on consumer electronic products, notably including quotas in&#13;
the U.S. on imports of monochrome TV sets, while the U.S. has introduced&#13;
"monitoring" of color television set imports from Taiwan. In addition to&#13;
these principal measures, there have been a variety of new nontariff mea-&#13;
sures--countervailing duties, emergency quotas, etc.--in a number of other&#13;
products, such as fabricated steel products, and much noise in favor of&#13;
protection, cartelization and/or "organized trade" in petrochemicals, syn-&#13;
thetic fibers, and an assortment of other products.   A few processed agri-&#13;
cultural products such as beef and sugar have also been affected.&#13;
In this political climate, threats of protection along with&#13;
protection and subsidies rank as major obstacles to trade. Meanwhile,&#13;
recently GATT estimated that 3 to 5 percent of world trade had been affected&#13;
by new nontariff measures in the last three years.&#13;
There may be more protection to come. And in addition to new overt&#13;
measures such as those noted, developing countries are being warned through&#13;
a host of signals: public pressures for protection, new French initiatives,&#13;
restrictions against Japanese exports, and (no doubt) behind-the-scenes&#13;
diplomacy. Nevertheles, the threatened actions are in most cases mild.&#13;

ANNEX A&#13;
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES'IMPORTS OF MANUFACTURES&#13;
Imports of manufactures by developing countries have trended upward&#13;
year by year in real terms, reaching $129 billion in 1975. 1/     Of this total,&#13;
86% or over $111 billion were supplied by developed countries. This was 5.8&#13;
times the trade flow in the opposite direction, which was $19 billion in&#13;
exporters' statistics. 2/ This represents an unusually high ratio due to&#13;
the recession on the one hand, and the oil boom on the other. In 1973 this&#13;
ratio was 3.7.&#13;
The share of machinery and transport equipment (SITC 7) in the total&#13;
is usually in the neighborhood of 50% or a little higher, reaching 55% in&#13;
1975. This is also roughly true for each developing region. In 1975 this&#13;
share was 56% in Latin America, 48% in East and South Asia, 58% in the Middle&#13;
East and 57% in Africa and Oceania.&#13;
Thanks to the oil boom, the latter two regions are now close to the&#13;
first two in the value of their imports of manufactures. Each of the four&#13;
regions imported over $300 billion worth of manufactures in 1975.&#13;
The developing countries' share of the developed countries' exports&#13;
has jumped from about one fifth in the early 1970's, and slightly less than&#13;
that in 1973, to over one fourth in 1975. In real terms developing countries'&#13;
imports of manufactures from our sources rose by 70% and their imports from&#13;
developed countries increased by 66% in the 1970-75 period; these numbers&#13;
imply real growth rates in the order of 11% per year. Judging by what has&#13;
happened to total imports, this growth must have slowed somewhat in 1976.&#13;
According to IMF figures, total imports by developing countries rose in value&#13;
about 10% from $191.6 billion in 1975 to $211.1 billion in 1976. 3/&#13;
The following table summarizes some of the relevant statistical&#13;
series, based on UN trade matrixes.&#13;
1/   Here and throughout this annex, Yugoslavia is counted as a developed&#13;
rather than a developing country: if it were counted as developing, the&#13;
numbers would be higher.&#13;
2/   These statistics understate the exports to developed countries, because&#13;
they exclude Mexico's border exports and understate some other flows.&#13;
3!   They have grown further in 1977.&#13;

            World trade and output of manufactures :
            structural trends and developing countries' exports
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Developing countries' manufactured
            exports increased from 1960 through 1976 at rates around 15
            percent per year. This paper is concerned with the changing
            structural features of these exports and how they relate to
            world manufacturing output and markets, which have expanded
            much more slowly. Numerous relationships are explored, with
            speculative interpretations as well as tables. Here are
            examples of findings: the share of manufacturing output
            traded internationally in market economies has risen
            rapidly, but remains less than one sixth, and is lower in
            developing countries. The share of LDC exports in
            manufactures in developed countries has recently passed one
            percent, and ranges in individual countries from about 0.5
            to 2 percent; but examples are given of much higher
            penetration in narrow product lines. Even these exports come
            mainly from a few countries and consist predominantly of
            labor-intensive goods such as clothing and electronic
            assembly products; rapid export growth has also taken place
            in a wide range of other products and in many other LDCs,
            and has extended to trade in manufactures among developing
            countries themselves, which has quite a different composition.
