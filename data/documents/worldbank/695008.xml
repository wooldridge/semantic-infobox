Project Description:       The project consists of: (i) extension of water supply facilities in Kesrouan&#13;
and Nabatiye sub-project areas and of wastewater collection and disposal&#13;
systems in Kesrouan, Saida, Sour and Nabatiye sub-project areas; (ii)&#13;
operation, maintenance and training services contract(s) nation-wide; (iii)&#13;
operation and maintenance equipment for five regional water authorities,&#13;
or successor regional water and sanitation companies, and for&#13;
environmental monitoring; (iv) consultant services, technical assistance&#13;
and management contracts for the establishment, development and&#13;
operation of sector institutions; and (v) consultant services for project&#13;
management, engineering, construction supervision, environmental&#13;
monitoring, and performance auditing.&#13;
Benefits:                  The project will reduce existing wastewater pollution and restore beaches&#13;
for recreational use; improve environmental and health conditions; and&#13;
help protect water resources and provide safe drinking water. It will assist&#13;
in restructuring the sector by combining the services of water supply with&#13;
wastewater collection and disposal into regional authorities, or successor&#13;
companies. These authorities/companies, to be operated on a commercial&#13;
basis, will ensure improved quality of services. The project will also&#13;
ensure satisfactory operation and maintenance of equipment installed or&#13;
rehabilitated under the ongoing NERP.&#13;
Risks:                     The project faces two major risks in addition to potential political&#13;
instability in the region. The establishment of regional companies, which&#13;
depends on legislative action, could be delayed and thus affect needed&#13;
improvements in operational performance. Political pressure regarding&#13;
tariff adjustments could impede regional authorities/companies from&#13;
becoming financially viable. However, taking into account that there is&#13;
an urgent need to reduce pollution and provide basic water supply and&#13;
sanitation services, and that the Government is fully committed to&#13;
restructure the sector to ensure service quality and financial viability, the&#13;
risks are considered acceptable. Furthermore, to reduce direct political&#13;
influence on tariffs, institutional reforms supported by the project include&#13;
the establishment of the FRC for tariff review and approval.&#13;
Poverty Category:          The project is not part of a core poverty program but will include areas&#13;
where poverty is acute.  It will have a beneficial impact on poor&#13;
households, which are sometimes forced to purchase water from vendors&#13;
at relatively high prices. Improved water quality and sanitation will have a&#13;
positive impact on reduction of water-related diseases, which mostly affect&#13;
the poor.&#13;
Economic Rate of Return:  Estimated for water supply components only. It is 15 percent for both&#13;
Kesrouan and Nabatiye sub-project areas.&#13;

LEBANESE REPUBLIC&#13;
COASTAL POLLUTION CONTROL AND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1    Lebanon, which had been a prosperous middle-income country in the mid 1970s, is only now&#13;
beginning to recover from the devastation caused by 15 years of violent civil strife and military&#13;
occupation. Extensive damage to physical assets occurred, both as a direct result of the war, as well as&#13;
through the accumulated effects of disruption in capital investment and maintenance.&#13;
1.2    The impact of the civil war on social conditions was equally grave. The loss of human resources&#13;
was considerable; apart from the tragic loss of life and the disabling of hundreds of thousands of people,&#13;
about 200,000 professional and skilled Lebanese sought employment in other countries. While this&#13;
resulted in major shortages of skilled workers in various sectors of the economy, unemployment&#13;
nevertheless is estimated to amount to 35 percent of the resident labor force, and is believed to be&#13;
particularly high among urban youth. Nearly one quarter of the population of 3.6 million was displaced&#13;
to live in unhealthy shanty towns and in semi-destroyed and vacated buildings in conditions of severe&#13;
overcrowding. Public and social services were either non-existent or of poor quality, with only about&#13;
one-third of power capacity operating, water treatment was inadequate as well as wastewater collection&#13;
and disposal systems and most schools and hospitals were damaged.&#13;
1.3   To redress this situation, the Government embarked upon a National Emergency Reconstruction&#13;
Program (NERP), which envisaged investments amounting to US$2.1 billion. Nearly three-quarters of&#13;
this program is in the infrastructure sectors. The Government accords these sectors a high priority in&#13;
order to provide a clean and healthy environment for Lebanon's inhabitants and to attract business and&#13;
tourism, which are essential to the country's economic growth.&#13;
II. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR&#13;
A. Sector Issues and Constraints&#13;
2.1    Despite the country's comparative richness in water resources in a region of great water scarcity,&#13;
the water supply and sanitation sector is in disarray and unable to provide adequate services to the&#13;
majority of the population. Approximately half of all water produced is unaccounted-for because of&#13;
losses and billing deficiencies, while leaking or overflowing wastewater collection systems contaminate&#13;
water sources and water distribution networks. The division of responsibilities between water supply and&#13;
wastewater affects operational efficiency and prevents joint planning and prioritization of investments.&#13;
There is a lack of financial resources at every level, resulting from inadequate cost recovery, and of clear&#13;
and transparent regulatory arrangements. The service deficiencies result both from the years of turmoil&#13;
and neglect of infrastructure operation and maintenance and from more fundamental structural problems&#13;
in the sector.&#13;
B. Institutional Structure&#13;
2.2    The current allocation of responsibilities for water supply and wastewater is fragmented. While&#13;
the Ministry of Hydraulics and Electric Resources (MHER) has primary responsibility for water&#13;
resources and potable water supply, the Ministry of Agriculture is involved in the construction of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                             Coastal Pollution Control and Water Supply Project&#13;
irrigation systems, and the Litani River Authority is responsible for the planning, implementation and&#13;
operation of all water uses in the Litani River water basin. There are 20 regional water boards and 200&#13;
local water committees responsible for irrigation and/or water supply operation and maintenance.&#13;
Recently, MHER started the consolidation of the water boards and local committees into larger entities.&#13;
2.3    Responsibility for wastewater lies, in principle, with the municipalities, assisted by their&#13;
sponsoring ministry, the Ministry of Municipalities and Rural Affairs. In practice, the municipalities&#13;
have retained responsibility only for operation and maintenance, while for investments they depend on&#13;
several ministries. The construction of wastewater collection systems has been mainly handled by the&#13;
Ministry of Housing and Cooperatives, but is now the responsibility of MHER. The Ministry of&#13;
Environment (MOE) is responsible for regulating the environmental impacts of waste disposal and the&#13;
Ministry of Public Health for setting and monitoring the quality of water supplies and the public health&#13;
aspects of waste disposal practices. The Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR) is&#13;
responsible for economic and physical planning for the Government and for the coordination of projects&#13;
with donor financing. The Sector Implementation Units (SIUs) in the MHER and MOE, which were&#13;
established under the ERRP, are staffed by consultants responsible for project management. The SIUs&#13;
report to their respective ministries and coordinate with the CDR. The Government's plans for sector&#13;
restructuring include the merging of responsibilities for water supply and wastewater and a consolidation&#13;
of the number of operating units with the initial creation of regional water authorities, which&#13;
subsequently would be converted into regional water and sanitation companies.&#13;
C. Sector Investment Program&#13;
2.4    The sector investment program under the NERP envisages overall investments in the range of&#13;
US$1.0 billion over the next ten years for rehabilitation and extension of water supply and wastewater&#13;
collection and disposal facilities. The emphasis is on wastewater collection and disposal due to past&#13;
neglect and the need to reach a satisfactory level of service to improve public health and attract business&#13;
and tourism. The first three years of the program have been devoted mainly to rehabilitation of existing&#13;
works, with funding provided by the Bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Arab Fund, the&#13;
Saudi Fund, the Kuwait Fund, Germany (KfW) and France. In Greater Beirut, KfW is funding the&#13;
rehabilitation of the southern wastewater disposal works at Ghadir, while construction/rehabilitation of&#13;
the northern wastewater disposal works at Dora is being considered for funding through private&#13;
investments. Rehabilitation and extension of Tripoli's wastewater collection and disposal system is&#13;
expected to be funded by the EIB. The project will cover the priority wastewater collection and disposal&#13;
systems in the remaining major coastal population centers of Kesrouan, Saida and Sour.&#13;
2.5    Future projects are expected to be increasingly undertaken by the private sector, once the&#13;
framework for sector reforms and private sector participation has been established. The Bisri dam and&#13;
Awali Conveyor (for Greater Beirut water supply) are two major projects likely to attract the private&#13;
sector, as are works required for improved wastewater treatment for coastal discharge.&#13;
D. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.6    The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy, discussed by the Board on June&#13;
30, 1994, which focuses on the rehabilitation of infrastructure, including addressing environmental&#13;
concerns, and the increasing role of the private sector in the provision of public services. The project&#13;
assists the Government in the transition from emergency reconstruction to investment that supports&#13;
increasing economic prosperity and the establishment of institutions to lead the sector into the next&#13;
century. In March 1993, Bank activity resumed in Lebanon with the approval of a loan of US$175&#13;
million for the Emergency Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Project (ERRP), which financed high&#13;
priority components of the NERP in the fields of power, water supply and wastewater, solid waste,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Coastal Pollution Control and Water Supply Project                                        3&#13;
education and telecommunications. Implementation is proceeding well, after some initial delays. A&#13;
Supplementary Loan of US$50 million to the ERRP, which also includes funding for repair of water&#13;
supply, wastewater and power facilities damaged during the April 1996 hostilities, was approved by the&#13;
Board on May 30, 1996. Bank involvement in this project will help implement the sector restructuring&#13;
initiated under the ERRP and promote effective private sector participation. It will help ensure the&#13;
attainment of the sector objectives, particularly cost recovery, and enhanced accountability. The Bank is&#13;
in a unique position to assist because of its experience in the sector and its ability to attract support from&#13;
other donors.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Development Program&#13;
3.1    Damage Assessment Reports prepared for the NERP have served as background documentation&#13;
for the preparation of feasibility and engineering studies for rehabilitation and a first-phase extension of&#13;
water supply and wastewater facilities throughout the country. In 1994, a previously prepared sanitation&#13;
master plan was updated, which resulted in the Lebanon's Staged Wastewater Program. The program&#13;
provides, on a national basis, an analysis of present sanitary conditions, future requirements and&#13;
investment priorities. This, in conjunction with a Water Resources Development Program, scheduled for&#13;
preparation during 1997, will set the stage for major investments to be made in the water supply and&#13;
wastewater sector. Studies have shown that environmental conditions along the coast are in comparison&#13;
more severe than for the inland areas, and priorities have been determined accordingly.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
3.2    The objectives of the project are to: (i) improve sanitary and environmental conditions in three&#13;
major urban areas of the coastal zone covering a population of about 0.7 million; (ii) extend water supply&#13;
and wastewater services in selected areas; (iii) reduce groundwater and surface water pollution; (iv)&#13;
reduce the pollution in the sea to restore beaches for recreational use; (v) ensure satisfactory operation&#13;
and maintenance of equipment installed or rehabilitated under the NERP; and (vi) restructure the sector&#13;
to achieve improved services through commercial operation and increased private sector participation.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
3.3    The project consists of the following major components:&#13;
(a)    extension and rehabilitation of water supply facilities in the Kesrouan and Nabatiye sub-&#13;
project areas and wastewater collection and disposal systems in the Kesrouan, Saida,&#13;
Sour and Nabatiye sub-project areas;&#13;
(b)    operation, maintenance and training services contract(s), country-wide, for mechanical&#13;
and electrical equipment installed or rehabilitated under the NERP, including&#13;
procurement of consumables and spare parts;&#13;
(c)    operation and maintenance equipment and office facilities for the five regional water&#13;
authorities or successor regional water and sanitation companies (paras. 5.2(d) and 5.3),&#13;
and operational equipment for environmental monitoring; and&#13;
For Sour and Saida the water supply services will be improved and extended concurrently with this project&#13;
with financing, to an amount of US$35 million equivalent, provided by the Arab Fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                Coastal Pollution Control and Water Supply Project&#13;
(d)    consultant services and technical assistance for: the establishment and development of&#13;
sector institutions at national and regional levels, including management contracts;&#13;
environmental monitoring; project management; and engineering, construction&#13;
supervision and auditing for performance review.&#13;
3.4    The water supply components include extension and rehabilitation of water sources and&#13;
treatment works, transmission mains, storage reservoirs, pumping stations and distribution mains. The&#13;
wastewater components include extension and rehabilitation of networks, interceptors and trunk mains,&#13;
pumping stations and treatment works, and submarine outfall mains. Details of the water supply and&#13;
wastewater components are described in Annex 1.&#13;
3.5    The design standard for proposed wastewater treatment works and outfall mains is based on the&#13;
Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) for the protection and development of the Mediterranean Basin.2 The&#13;
objective adopted by the Mediterranean countries is the provision of secondary treatment in all coastal&#13;
cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants and of preliminary or primary treatment in all towns with more&#13;
than 10,000 inhabitants. Under the project it is proposed, with the exception of Sour, to provide in a first&#13;
phase for preliminary treatment with the outfall mains to be designed to satisfy the adopted standard on&#13;
faecal coliform pollution. In a subsequent phase, secondary treatment will be added, for which the&#13;
timing will be subject to the results from proposed environmental monitoring. In Sour, it was proved to&#13;
be feasible to initially provide for secondary treatment and also to use the treated effluents for irrigation.&#13;
In each sub-project area, an analysis of alternatives was carried out and selected project components&#13;
represent least cost solutions. Industrial effluents should be pre-treated where required, and satisfactory&#13;
arrangements should be made for the servicing of septic tanks. During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
given by the Gevemment that rules preventing the discharge into the public wastewater collection&#13;
systems of industrial effluents containing toxic/harmful substances, as identified in the "Land Based&#13;
Sources Protocol",3 will be enforced from January 1, 2000.&#13;
3.6    Operation, maintenance (O&amp;M) and training services contract(s), covering the whole of&#13;
Lebanon, with a duration of three years will be entered into for mechanical and electrical equipment&#13;
installed or rehabilitated under the NERP. These contracts, which will also include training of existing&#13;
and new O&amp;M staff, would, at a later date, be incorporated under the management structure and work&#13;
program of the five regional water authorities, or successor regional water and sanitation companies. To&#13;
facilitate the establishment of the regional authorities/companies the project will include operation and&#13;
maintenance equipment and office facilities to be specified after an assessment has been made of the&#13;
requirements, which is scheduled for early- 1997.&#13;
3.7    The project component on sector reforms (para. 5.4) will include the provision of:  (i) an&#13;
institutional specialist to manage the implementation of sector reforms; (ii) consultant services for the&#13;
preparation of requests for proposals for management contracts and technical assistance and for studies&#13;
to determine organizational and staffing structures, systems, procedures and by-laws; and (iii)&#13;
implementation of management and technical assistance contracts.&#13;
2      Adopted in 1975 by the sixteen states bordering the Mediterranean Sea including Lebanon. The legal&#13;
framework for the MAP was determined at a conference in Barcelona in 1976 with additional protocols&#13;
adopted in Athens, 1980, and Geneva, 1982. The signatories of the MAP have adopted the WHO/UNEP&#13;
Faecal Coliforn standard for recreational water suitable for bathing.&#13;
"Land Based Sources Protocol" means the Protocol for the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution from Land&#13;
Based Sources, dated June 17, 1983, to the Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against&#13;
Pollution, known as the Barcelona Convention, dated February 12, 1978.&#13;

3.8    Consultant services for engineering and construction supervision will cover: (i) the water supply&#13;
components for Kesrouan and Nabatiye; and (ii) the wastewater components, including oceanographic&#13;
surveys, for Kesrouan, Saida and Sour. Ongoing consultant contracts cover engineering only, but should&#13;
be extended, in due course, to include construction supervision. The contract for the SIU, or its&#13;
successor, which is currently responsible for project management, should be extended as required.&#13;
D. Project Costs and Financing&#13;
3.9    Total project costs including physical and price contingencies are estimated at US$308 million,&#13;
of which 72 percent, or US$222 million, are in foreign exchange. The cost estimates are based on&#13;
feasibility reports, preliminary engineering design and recent unit-rate comparators and are expressed in&#13;
mid-1996 prices and converted at the rate of 1,580 Lebanese Pounds (LL) to the US Dollar. Physical&#13;
contingencies are based on status of project preparation for various components and accuracy of&#13;
available data. Price contingencies have been applied according to projected local and foreign annual&#13;
inflation rates over the implementation period in accordance with IBRD guidelines. Detailed cost&#13;
breakdowns are shown in Annex 2.&#13;
3.10   The proposed Bank loan of JPY 6 billion (US$53.1 million equivalent) would finance about 17&#13;
percent of the total project costs, net of duties and taxes, and would meet about 22 percent of the foreign-&#13;
cost requirements. The proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 3.1 with details shown in&#13;
Annex 3.&#13;

3.11   Components to be financed by the Government and other financing agencies, through parallel&#13;
financing, are summarized below:&#13;
(a)   the Government would finance: (i) consultant services for engineering and construction&#13;
supervision for Kesrouan water supply and for the wastewater project components; (ii)&#13;
land acquisition; (iii) costs under contracts that cannot entirely be financed by the&#13;
financing agencies; and (iv) operational costs for implementation of the environmental&#13;
monitoring plan.&#13;
ECU 2.53 million (about US$3.2 million equivalent) has been secured with remaining amount proposed to&#13;
be negotiated at a later date. If this will not materialize, remaining amount will be covered through a loan&#13;
or Government contributions.&#13;

(b)   the World Bank would finance:  (i) the Nabatiye water supply and wastewater&#13;
components; (ii) the submarine outfall mains for Kesrouan and Sour; (iii) operation,&#13;
maintenance and training services contract(s) including provision of auditors; (iv) office&#13;
facilities and operation and maintenance equipment for the five regional&#13;
authorities/companies and for the implementation of the environmental monitoring plan;&#13;
(v) an institutional specialist under sectbr reforms; and (vi) consultant services for&#13;
Nabatiye water supply and wastewater (construction supervision) and for the preparation&#13;
of an environmental monitoring plan;&#13;
(c)   the EIB would finance the Kesrouan  and Sour wastewater components, except the&#13;
submarine outfall mains;&#13;
(d)   the OECF (Japan) would finance: (i) the Kesrouan water supply component; and (ii) the&#13;
Saida wastewater component, including the submarine outfall main; and&#13;
(e)   the EU would finance under sector reforms and project management: (i) consultant&#13;
services; (ii) implementation of management contracts and technical assistance&#13;
packages; and (iii) extension of the SIU contract, or its successor, to be included under a&#13;
separate grant (with ECU 4.25 million proposed to be allocated for the SIU), which is&#13;
being negotiated.  Arrangements for financing of (ii) would be negotiated at the&#13;
conclusion of consultant services under (i).&#13;
3.12   For the IBRD-financed project components, retroactive financing corresponding to 5 percent of&#13;
the loan amount, or JPY 294 million, is proposed for payments made after December 1, 1996 and prior to&#13;
loan signing. Such payments would particularly apply to the Nabatiye water supply and wastewater&#13;
component, which is in an advance stage of preparation.&#13;
IV. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Procurement&#13;
4.1   Procurement will follow the same procedures that were established under the ERRP, with CDR&#13;
as the responsible agency, supported by the SIU in MHER. For project components to be financed by&#13;
IBRD, the following number of contracts are envisaged: (i) one contract for the Nabatiye water supply&#13;
and wastewater components; (ii) one contract for each of the two submarine outfall mains, unless it&#13;
proves to be feasible to combine them under one contract; (iii) one or possibly two contracts for&#13;
operation, maintenance and training services; (iv) about 10 contracts for office facilities, operation and&#13;
maintenance equipment for the regional companies and operational equipment for environmental&#13;
monitoring; and (v) one contract for an institutional specialist. All goods, works and services should be&#13;
procured in accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans, published in January&#13;
1995 and revised in January and August 1996, and Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency published in August 1981.&#13;

Coastal Pollution Control and Water Supply Project                                      7&#13;
4.2    Specific procurement arrangements are:&#13;
(a)    civil works contracts, which will be prequalified, will be in the range of US$3 to 15&#13;
million and should be awarded following international competitive bidding (ICB)&#13;
procedures;&#13;
(b)    all contracts for equipment and materials exceeding US$500,000 will be awarded using&#13;
ICB procedures. Contracts for equipment and materials, not exceeding US$500,000&#13;
each, can be procured through international shopping based on three quotations from at&#13;
least two countries. Contracts for equipment and materials, not exceeding US$100,000&#13;
each, can be procured through local shopping based on three quotations. The total&#13;
aggregate value for such contracts will not exceed US$4.0 million and US$1.0 million&#13;
for international and local shopping, respectively.&#13;
(c)    contract(s) for operation, maintenance and training services, which would be in the range&#13;
of US$10 to 20 million, will be awarded based on invitation of proposals from a short&#13;
list of qualified firms.&#13;
Prior review will include all contracts for works and goods with a value exceeding US$500,000, and for&#13;
consulting services with a value exceeding US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals.&#13;
Details of procurement methods and arrangements are shown in Annex 4.&#13;
B. Disbursements&#13;
4.3    Disbursements are expected to begin in the last quarter of calendar year 1997 and be completed&#13;
before the project's proposed closing date, June 30, 2002. The loan proceeds would be disbursed against&#13;
eligible expenditures from the main categories as shown in Table 4.1.&#13;
Table 4.1: Loan Disbursements Categories&#13;

goods valued below US$500,000, for consulting firms valued below US$100,000 and for individual&#13;
consultants valued below US$50,000, for which the supporting documentation would be retained for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                           Coastal Pollution Control and Water Supply Project&#13;
review by Bank supervision missions. For contracts to be financed by the EIB, OECF and the EU,&#13;
disbursements will be made against 100 percent of contract costs unless otherwise agreed.&#13;
4.4    Given the long interruption in lending to Lebanon, there is no disbursement profile for the&#13;
country. However, available indicators from ongoing projects show that, once contracts have been&#13;
awarded, they are usually completed on time. Project preparation is proceeding well with tendering&#13;
expected to take place as planned, and the schedule of disbursements, as shown in Annex 5, has been&#13;
estimated accordingly.&#13;
4.5    To facilitate disbursements against eligible expenditures, the Government will establish in the&#13;
Central Bank a Special Account (SA) operated by CDR under terms and conditions satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank. The Bank would, upon request, make authorized allocation of US$3.5 million in the SA of the&#13;
CDR. Initially, the allocation would be limited to US$1.5 million. The full authorized allocation could&#13;
be claimed when disbursements reach JPY227 million.  The CDR would submit replenishment&#13;
applications for the SA on a monthly basis, or when about 20 percent of the initial deposit has been&#13;
utilized, whichever occurs first. The replenishment applications would be supported by the necessary&#13;
documentation, bank statement of the SA and a reconciliation bank statement of the SA against Bank&#13;
records. The minimum amount for applications for direct payment and for special commitment would be&#13;
20 percent of the authorized allocation to the SA.&#13;
C. Project Implementation&#13;
4.6   Feasibility reports for water supply and wastewater for each of the sub-project areas have been&#13;
prepared by consulting firms and are available in the Project File. Preparation of engineering designs&#13;
and tender documents are underway, which includes an inventory of industrial effluents with an analysis&#13;
of the need for on-site pretreatment. Land acquisition will be required for sites for pumping stations,&#13;
storage tanks, and the three wastewater treatment works, with the one in Sour involving resettlement of&#13;
12 persons. The process of land acquisition has commenced and a resettlement plan has been agreed to.&#13;
During negotiations, assurances were given by CDR that all land will be available and the resettlement&#13;
for the Sour treatment site will be completed before December 31, 1997. This would ensure that land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement will take place before construction works are scheduled to start.&#13;
4.7    The project would be implemented over about four years with completion to take place before&#13;
December 31, 2001. A project implementation schedule is shown on Annex 6, with key highlights&#13;
summarized below:&#13;
(a)    Water supply components: Contracts for Nabatiye are expected to be completed by&#13;
mid -1999, and for Kesrouan by mid-2000. The extension of water supply facilities in&#13;
Sour and Saida under Arab Fund financing would follow about the same schedule.&#13;
Improved water supply services in the four sub-project areas will therefore be available&#13;
by mid-2000.&#13;
(b)    Wastewater collection and disposal components: The oceanographic surveys will be&#13;
carried out over a year-long period during 1996/97. The completion of interceptors,&#13;
trunk mains and treatment works, which are on the critical path, is scheduled for mid-&#13;
2000. The sub-marine outfall mains will also completed by mid-2000 to enable a&#13;
commissioning of total systems.&#13;
(c)    Operation, maintenance and training services contract(s): The contract(s), as well as&#13;
the appointment of auditors for performance review, are urgently required and are&#13;
scheduled to be awarded by end-1997 to be completed by end-2000, at which time&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Coastal Pollution Control and Water Supply Project                                        9&#13;
relevant functions will be taken over and performed by the regional&#13;
authorities/companies.&#13;
(d)    Operational and maintenance equipment with provision of office facilities for the&#13;
regional companies: Based on an assessment of the requirements to be completed by&#13;
early-1997, procurement is scheduled to take place during 1997/98 to coincide with the&#13;
proposed consolidation of the regional authorities/companies.&#13;
(e)    Sector reforms: The institutional specialist is scheduled to be appointed by mid-1997,&#13;
for a three-year assignment, with the possibility of extension.  The contracts for&#13;
consultant services for phase 2 (para. 5.4) should be awarded before end-1997 for&#13;
completion during 1999.  The management and technical assistance contracts for&#13;
national and regional sector entities would be awarded during 1999 for a three years'&#13;
duration.&#13;
(f)    Consultancies for construction  supervision:   Consulting firms appointed for&#13;
engineering design and preparation of tender specifications are expected to be retained&#13;
for construction supervision.&#13;
The implementation schedule reflects an integrated approach to the provision of physical assets/new&#13;
facilities, satisfactory operation and maintenance of existing electrical and mechanical equipment, and&#13;
the establishment of a sector organization adequate for the requirements. The commissioning of most of&#13;
the physical works would take place during 2000, while the implementation of sector reforms will be&#13;
more gradual, with the completion of phase 3 (para. 5.4) stretching beyond the project's proposed closing&#13;
date.&#13;
D. Project Management and Monitoring&#13;
4.8    The project management and monitoring systems established for the ongoing ERRP will&#13;
basically be maintained. The SIU, or its successor, will continue to perform the project management&#13;
function, directly reporting to the MHER and coordinating with the CDR, which will act as overall&#13;
coordinator and planner, including specific functions on procurement and disbursements such as entering&#13;
into contracts and effecting payments. The contractor(s) for the provision of operation, maintenance and&#13;
training services will report directly to the Director General for Operations of the MHER, who will&#13;
appoint an auditor (a local firm) for review and supervision of the contractors' performance. The&#13;
institutional specialist will manage the process of sector reforms and report to a Steering Committee&#13;
chaired by the Minister of MHER. Specific functions to be performed by the SIU, or its successor, refer&#13;
to: manage the consultant services on engineering and construction supervision; prepare tender&#13;
evaluation reports and make recommendations to award of contracts; and report on project progress. The&#13;
present SIU contract, financed by the EU, will expire by September 1997; it is proposed that the contract&#13;
be restructured and extended through 2001.  During negotiations, assurances were given by the&#13;
Govemment that it will extend the management contract as required for project execution.&#13;
4.9    A reporting system has been established with monthly progress reports to be prepared by the&#13;
consulting firms for submission to the SIU. The SIU, in turn, will report monthly to the CDR, which will&#13;
monitor overall progress. Based on this information, the SIU will prepare quarterly progress reports that&#13;
will also include performance monitoring indicators as shown in Annex 7. These indicators will initially&#13;
be established for the sub-project areas, and later extended to cover the areas of the South Lebanon and&#13;
Mount Lebanon regional companies. For the operation, maintenance and training services contract(s),&#13;
the MHER will prepare quarterly progress reports, for which specific monitoring indicators will be&#13;
established. The performance under these contract(s) will also be subject to review by auditors. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                            Coastal Pollution Control and Water Supply Project&#13;
institutional specialist will submit quarterly progress reports to the Steering Committee. The quarterly&#13;
progress reports, including performance indicators, should be submitted to the Bank for review. During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were given by CDR that (i) quarterly progress reports including performance&#13;
monitoring indicators will be submitted to the Bank for review within 30 days after the end of the&#13;
reporting period; and (ii) a mid-term project review will be carried out by no later than July 1, 1999.&#13;
E. Project Supervision&#13;
4.10   The project covers investments to be made in four different geographical areas, operation,&#13;
maintenance and training services contract(s) country-wide, and the establishment of five regional&#13;
authorities/companies and of national sector entities. This provides an overall approach to long-term&#13;
sector development in conjunction with priority investments in coastal water pollution control. In this&#13;
context, the requirements for Bank supervision will be significant, with, on average, three missions per&#13;
year with staff, as needed, specialized in engineering, financial analysis, operation/maintenance,&#13;
environmental matters, and institutional/privatization development. Given the growing number of&#13;
infrastructure projects in Lebanon and the opportunities to combine missions, the total cost of&#13;
supervision over the project implementation period is estimated at about US$300,000.&#13;
F. Accounts, Audits and Reports&#13;
4.11   CDR will keep separate accounts for project expenditures in accordance with accounting&#13;
principles and practices acceptable to the Bank. It will have ultimate responsibility for project budgeting&#13;
and accounting and will coordinate project activities executed by the various institutions concerned, as&#13;
well as consolidate the accounts. CDR will also prepare reimbursement requests and forward them to the&#13;
Bank. The regional authorities/companies will be subject to audit by independent auditors in accordance&#13;
with internationally accepted standards. These audits will be made available to the Bank. During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were given by CDR that: it will continue to have its accounts audited annually&#13;
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, who will, in addition to overall audit reports, prepare&#13;
and submit separate opinions on the accuracy and appropriateness of the project accounts, SOEs and SA;&#13;
annual audit reports for the South Lebanon and Beirut and Mount Lebanon regional water authorities, or&#13;
successor regional water and sanitation companies, will be prepared beginning with the year 1999; and&#13;
the annual audit reports and the report on project accounts will be submitted to the Bank within nine&#13;
months of the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
G. Environmental Assessment&#13;
4.12   The project has been placed in environmental screening category "A" consistent with&#13;
Operational Directive 4.01. Environmental Assessments (EAs) were prepared for the water supply and&#13;
wastewater facilities for each sub-project area. A public consultation meeting was held in Sour with&#13;
representatives from local municipalities, community associations, and social institutions. In Kesrouan,&#13;
Saida and Nabatiye, discussions have taken place with the owners and managers of large industries and&#13;
with municipal authorities. Information collected and opinions expressed were incorporated into the&#13;
project concept and proposed mitigation measures.&#13;
4.13   Mitigation measures common to each sub-project area, which are shown in Annex 8, address:&#13;
impacts relating to project design and the siting and routing of facilities; short-term impacts during&#13;
construction; and long-term impacts during operations. The environmental monitoring plan for each sub-&#13;
project area will cover: (i) physical oceanographic measurements; (ii) seawater chemical and&#13;
bacteriological analyses, including heavy metals and sediments; (iii) water quality for beaches for&#13;
recreational use close to the sea outfalls; and (iv) potential impact on fish, deep-sea organism and&#13;
shellfish in proximity to the sea outfalls. Monitoring will commence prior to construction of the sea&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Coastal Pollution Control and Water Supply Project                                   11&#13;
outfalls and continue during the periods of construction and subsequent operations. An analysis of the&#13;
results will then determine the timing for a later extension for secondary waste water treatment. The&#13;
monitoring will be coordinated with recommendations to be made under a Coastal Development Plan to&#13;
be prepared under the ongoing Solid Waste/Environmental Management Project (Loan 3899-LE). Water&#13;
quality at springs and groundwater aquifers will be monitored to ensure compliance with public health&#13;
standards. The SIU, or its successor, will manage the preparation of the environmental monitoring plan&#13;
and its initial implementation. During negotiations, assurances were given by CDR that an environmental&#13;
monitoring plan will be prepared before May 1, 1998; implementation will be agreed upon. The&#13;
principal institutions with environmental responsibilities for the water supply and wastewater sector will&#13;
be the MHER and MOE at the national level and the regional authorities/companies at the local level.&#13;
The MOE is presently supported by the UNDP for the development of a legal framework and&#13;
institutional capacity for monitoring and enforcement.&#13;
V. SECTOR RESTRUCTURING&#13;
A. Sector Development Policy&#13;
5.1    The Government has approved a water sector development policy that provides the framework&#13;
for proposed sector reforms as summarized in Annex 9. The sector reforms center on the establishment&#13;
of an institutional structure that will enable commercialization of the delivery of water supply and&#13;
wastewater services.  To implement the sector reforms, the Government is committed to: (a)&#13;
transforming existing institutions to enable them to independently manage sector activities and generate&#13;
the necessary financial resources; (b) making regional companies responsible for water supply and&#13;
wastewater services, which could also include irrigation, and providing them with the power to execute&#13;
projects and to enter into financial agreements; and (c) involving the private sector in operation and&#13;
maintenance through management contracts which, in a subsequent phase, could evolve into leasing or&#13;
concession contracts.&#13;
5.2   The sector policy, the legal requirements of which have been translated into a draft law,&#13;
proposes:&#13;
At the National Level:&#13;
(a)    A National Water Resources Authority (NWRA) will be created with responsibility for&#13;
strategic planning of water resources development and for allocation of water for&#13;
different uses. However, these functions will, initially, be performed by MHER; NWRA&#13;
will be established in a subsequent phase under the tutelage of MHER.&#13;
(b)    A Finance Regulatory Commission (FRC) will be established to regulate cost recovery&#13;
and tariffs.&#13;
(c)    The MHER will be strengthened to assume responsibility for policy, planning and&#13;
control functions, including the establishment and monitoring of service delivery and&#13;
technical standards.&#13;
At the Regional Level:&#13;
(d)    Three Regional Water, Sanitation and Irrigation Companies will be established for North&#13;
Lebanon, Beirut and Mount Lebanon and North Beka'a to assume responsibility for&#13;
delivery of water supply and wastewater services and for the delivery of water to&#13;
individual irrigation schemes managed by farmers' associations. Two Regional Water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                            Coastal Pollution Control and Water Supply Project&#13;
and Sanitation Companies will be established for South Beka'a and South Lebanon,&#13;
while the Litani River Authority will remain responsible for irrigation in the Litani river&#13;
water basin and in South Lebanon.  The regional companies will be autonomous,&#13;
financially viable, publicly and/or privately-owned and subject to commercial law.&#13;
B. Implementation of Sector Reforms&#13;
5.3    The Government has, as an interim measure, proceeded with the establishment of five regional&#13;
water authorities, also to be responsible for the provision of wastewater services, through decrees that&#13;
have been approved and issued by the Council of Ministers. Once the draft law has been enacted, the&#13;
national entities can be established and the regional authorities will be converted into regional&#13;
companies. The draft law has been reviewed by the Bank and concluded to be satisfactory. This&#13;
arrangement will enable the immediate establishment of regional entities with the development of their&#13;
organizational and staffing structures as well as operational systems and procedures.  During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were given by the Government that the draft law will be introduced to the&#13;
Parliament before January 1, 1998.&#13;
5.4    The implementation of proposed sector reforms will be carried out under the following three&#13;
phases:&#13;
(a)    Phase 1 (1993-98) will be completed with the enactment of the draft law. It has&#13;
included a review of legislative and regulatory requirements, specific functions and&#13;
responsibilities and organizational structures and, as an interim measure, the&#13;
establishment of regional authorities.&#13;
(b)    Phase 2 (1997-1999) will include steps needed to enable the establishment and&#13;
development of the FRC and the regional companies, and the restructuring of the&#13;
MHER.&#13;
(c)    Phase 3 (1999-2002) will support the various sector entities in their start-up and initial&#13;
operation, which will include the provision of technical assistance, training and&#13;
management contracts.&#13;
5.5    To manage the implementation of sector reforms a Steering Committee, to be chaired by the&#13;
Minister of MHER, will be established with a secretariat to be headed by an institutional specialist.&#13;
Consultant services will be included under phase 2 and technical assistance/management contracts will&#13;
constitute phase 3. For activities under phase 3, an auditor should be appointed to be responsible for&#13;
performance review. The scope of technical assistance proposed under phase 2 and 3 is shown on Annex&#13;
9 with a schedule of implementation shown on Annex 6. Terms of reference for the institutional&#13;
specialist and consultant services are available in the project file.&#13;
VI. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Past and Present Performance&#13;
6.1    After some 15 years of civil strife and military occupation the water supply and wastewater&#13;
infrastructure has been severely damaged, and it will take several years to restore the services to a&#13;
satisfactory standard. This, coupled with the extreme fragmentation of the sector, and the far-from-&#13;
universal provision of wastewater collection and disposal services by individual municipalities, makes it&#13;
impractical to satisfactorily assess the past and current financial performance of the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Coastal Pollution Control and Water Supply Project                                         13&#13;
6.2    One of the major benefits of the project will be the institutional and financial restructuring of the&#13;
sector. The merger of existing water entities and the transfer of wastewater collection and disposal to&#13;
proposed regional authorities will be phased over about a one-year period and will include, inter alia, the&#13;
revaluation of existing assets and liabilities and the determination of the share capital (opening balance&#13;
sheet) of each of the regional authorities/companies as of the time of their creation. At this stage, it is not&#13;
possible to prepare pro-forma financial statements for the consolidated accounts of any of the regional&#13;
authorities due to lack of operating data as well as the inadequacy of current levels of operation and&#13;
maintenance. However, it has been possible to gain a reasonable insight into the cost structure, tariff&#13;
requirement and affordability characteristics of the sub-project areas of Kesrouan, Saida, Sour and&#13;
Nabatiye. Annex 10 shows combined income, cash flow, and affordability statements for each of the&#13;
sub-project areas. Briefly, these statements span an eight-year period, of which the first five years cover&#13;
the project period. The approach entails: (i) the determination of investment, operation and maintenance&#13;
costs on the basis of sound engineering and management practices; (ii) the calculation of the debt service&#13;
associated with proposed and future investments to reflect financing arrangements; (iii) the phasing in of&#13;
a 20 percent self-financing factor; and (iv) the calculation of the revenues required to ensure the financial&#13;
viability of the systems. On this basis, but without accounting for any return on existing assets (which&#13;
are mostly fully written-off), the average costs of water and wastewater services per cubic meter of water&#13;
supplied are US$1.42 in Kesrouan, US$1.03 in Saida, US$0.96 in Sour and US$0.61 in Nabatiye.&#13;
B. Tariffs/Cost Recovery&#13;
6.3    The regional authorities/companies will operate as financially self-sufficient entities, with the&#13;
revenues to be determined by their operating efficiency as well as the level of their tariffs. It is the&#13;
Government's policy that the revenues of the regional authorities/companies will be sufficient to cover&#13;
operating and maintenance expenses and debt service and to generate enough additional cash to enable&#13;
them  to provide the necessary counterpart financing for future expansions.  While the regional&#13;
companies should be legally established through the enactment of the draft law, financial viability will&#13;
only be achieved gradually, with tariffs to be adjusted over time and in line with service improvements.&#13;
It is the intention of the Government to gradually increase the tariffs to achieve full cost recovery by no&#13;
later than January 1, 2001, in the sub-project areas.&#13;
6.4    Government policy is to complete metering of the water supply services. Wastewater costs,&#13;
which have been recovered indirectly through municipal revenues, will be recovered along with those of&#13;
water supply. Differential tariffs will ensure that water supply and wastewater services are affordable&#13;
and will consist of schedules based on water actually consumed, with a wastewater surcharge added to&#13;
water bills.&#13;
6.5    The law creating the regional companies will also create an FRC under the tutelage of the&#13;
Ministry of Finance, for the purpose of reviewing and approving the tariff requests to be prepared by the&#13;
regional companies. The FRC is proposed to consist of seven commissioners and a small secretariat. To&#13;
enhance the independence of the FRC and to ensure transparency, the commissioners will be chosen&#13;
from representatives of commerce, industry, consumers and government, and their decisions will be&#13;
published in local newspapers.&#13;
C. Future Financial Outlook&#13;
6.6    Since the regional authorities have yet to become functional, the financial projections and&#13;
assumptions made are only illustrative of what is likely to happen. While this process has been very&#13;
useful in throwing much needed light on the implications of the new structures, the projected statements&#13;
could not be used for future performance monitoring. The regional authorities/companies are expected&#13;
to prepare business plans and budgets, which will form the basis for monitoring their performance. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                             Coastal Pollution Control and Water Supply Project&#13;
would provide indicators on service coverage and quality, operational efficiency, cost recovery and&#13;
financial sustainability.&#13;
D. Cost/Benefit Analysis&#13;
6.7    The project will help to protect water resources and provide safe drinking water in the sub-&#13;
project areas. It will eliminate existing harmful wastewater pollution in major coastal cities and tourism&#13;
areas, and improve environmental and health conditions. It will assist in restructuring the sector, in&#13;
enabling satisfactory operation and maintenance through private-sector participation, thus improving the&#13;
quality of service, and in introducing financial viability through improved billing and collection, thus&#13;
limiting and ultimately eliminating contributions from the national budget.&#13;
6.8    Based on the incremental costs of water supply and the incremental water quantities made&#13;
available as a result of the project, estimates for the long run average incremental cost (LRAIC) (per&#13;
cubic meter) for each area using a 10 percent discount rate are summarized in Table 6.1, which also&#13;
shows similar estimates for wastewater.&#13;
Table 6.1: LRAIC of Water Supply and Wastewater Disposal&#13;
(US$ per cubic meter)&#13;
Sub-project Area   Water Supply    Wastewater    Total&#13;
Kesrouan                 0.99             0.37         1.36&#13;
Nabatiye                 0.99             0.09         1.08&#13;
6.9    Estimates for the economic rates of return for Kesrouan and Nabatiye sub-project areas are 15&#13;
percent based on the existing price paid of US$1.32 per cubic meter of water. A sensitivity analysis also&#13;
shows that the rates of return remain at a satisfactory level at variations in costs and benefits (Annex 1 0).&#13;
This analysis is limited to sub-project areas where additional water quantities are made available under&#13;
the project 5 and does not take into account benefits that cannot readily be quantified, such as improved&#13;
health and environmental conditions and their subsequent impact on the standard of living and economic&#13;
development, particularly in tourism. Including these benefits would result in higher rates of return than&#13;
the ones calculated above.&#13;
E. Affordability&#13;
6.10   The ultimate test of the costs for provided services is their affordability to the beneficiaries. The&#13;
combined costs for water supply and wastewater, after allowing for differentiation in a tariff structure&#13;
between commercial/industrial and household users, would amount to less than 5 percent of average&#13;
household incomes in the sub-project areas. This is considered acceptable.&#13;
F. Risks&#13;
6.11   The project faces two major risks in addition to potential political instability in the region. The&#13;
establishment of regional companies, which depends on legislative action, could be delayed and thus&#13;
affect needed improvements in operational performance. Political pressure regarding tariff adjustments&#13;
could impede regional authorities/companies from becoming financially viable. However, taking into&#13;
Saida and Sour sub-project areas have only wastewater components financed under this project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Coastal Pollution Control and Water Supply Project                                      15&#13;
account that there is an urgent need to reduce pollution and provide basic water supply and sanitation&#13;
services, and that the Government is fully committed to restructure the sector to ensure service quality&#13;
and financial viability, the risks are considered acceptable. Furthermore, to reduce direct political&#13;
influence on tariffs, institutional reforms supported by the project include the establishment of the FRC&#13;
for tariff review and approval.&#13;
VII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1    During negotiations, assurances were given that:&#13;
(a)   the Government will enforce rules preventing the discharge into the public wastewater&#13;
collection systems of industrial effluents containing toxic/harmful substances from&#13;
January 1, 2000, as identified in the Land Based Sources Protocol (para. 3.5);&#13;
(b)    CDR will ensure that all land will be available and the resettlement for the Sour&#13;
treatment site will be completed before December 31, 1997 (para. 4.6);&#13;
(c)   the Government will extend the management contract for SIU, or its successor, as&#13;
required for project execution (para. 4.8);&#13;
(d)    CDR will ensure that (i) quarterly progress reports, including a review of performance&#13;
indicators, will be submitted to the Bank for review within 30 days after the end of the&#13;
reporting period; and (ii) a mid-term review will be carried out before July 1, 1999&#13;
(para. 4.9);&#13;
(e)    CDR will continue to have its accounts audited annually by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, who will, in addition to overall audit reports, prepare and submit&#13;
separate opinions on the accuracy and appropriateness of the project accounts, SOEs and&#13;
SA; and CDR will ensure that annual audit reports for the South Lebanon and Beirut and&#13;
Mount Lebanon regional water authorities, or successor regional water and sanitation&#13;
companies, will be prepared beginning with the year 1999, and that the annual audit&#13;
reports and the report on project accounts will be submitted to the Bank within nine&#13;
months of the end of each fiscal year (para. 4.1 1);&#13;
(f)    CDR will ensure that an environmental monitoring plan will be prepared before May 1,&#13;
1998, and implemented as to be agreed (para. 4.13); and&#13;
(g)   the Government will introduce to the Parliament before January 1, 1998 the agreed&#13;
draft law on sector reforms (para. 5.3).&#13;
7.2    The proposed project provides a suitable basis for a Bank Loan of Japanese Yen 6 billion to the&#13;
Lebanese Republic with 17 years' maturity, including 5 years of grace, at the standard interest rate for&#13;
LIBOR-based Japanese Yen single-currency loans.&#13;

LEBANESE REPUBLIC&#13;
COASTAL POLLUTION CONTROL AND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Project Description&#13;
1.    The project area covers Kesrouan, Saida, Sour and Nabatiye with surroundings (referred to as&#13;
sub-project areas) and is shown on Map No. IBRD 27466R. The characteristics of the sub-project areas&#13;
are:&#13;
(a)    The Kesrouan sub-project area is located about 20 kms north of Beirut and includes some&#13;
of the most densely populated parts of Lebanon. The area varies from heavily urbanized&#13;
along the sea coast to very lightly urbanized in the mountainous region, which is mainly&#13;
covered with natural forests. The area is one of the more developed in Lebanon and its&#13;
mountain villages and sea coast hotels and beaches are considered among the most&#13;
attractive summer resorts in the country.  The economy is based on tourism  and&#13;
manufacturing industries, entertainment facilities, and the commercial sector.&#13;
(b)    The Saida sub-project area is located between Sour and Beirut and covers a coastal strip&#13;
about 12 kms long and is bound by two rivers, Nahr Awali to the north and Nahr Zahrani to&#13;
the south. Saida is rich in historical landmarks. The coastal strip is mostly urbanized. The&#13;
Quasmieh irrigation canal crosses the area southward and supplies it with water. The&#13;
major economic activities, apart from the Zahrani oil refinery, are small and medium scale&#13;
enterprises, agriculture and fishing.&#13;
(c)    The Sour sub-project area is located on the southern coast of Lebanon, stretching&#13;
approximately 16 kms from east to west and 13 kms from north to south. It is a historical&#13;
area centered on the city of Sour (Tyre), once called the "Metropolis of Phoenicia." The&#13;
area, with its long sandy beaches, has a high potential for recreation and tourism. Industrial&#13;
activities are relatively insignificant with workshop factories operating on a small scale.&#13;
Most of the agricultural production emanates from the coastal strip with irrigated banana,&#13;
orange and lemon plantations. A major irrigation canal runs through the area as part of the&#13;
Quasmieh irrigation scheme, which is fed from the Litani river and the Ras El Ain springs.&#13;
(d)    The Nabatiye sub-project area is located between Sour and Saida and stretches from the&#13;
coast to the city of Nabatiye and covers approximately 17 kms from north to south and 20&#13;
kms from east to west. The land rises steeply from the narrow coastal plain to a rolling&#13;
plateau with incised valleys. This area, boarded by the Litani river from the south and east,&#13;
is mostly rural and is characterized by agricultural activities ranging from field crops to&#13;
orchards.&#13;
&#13;

Total    728,000       909,000       1,100,000&#13;
Present rural population (in conglomerations of less than 10,000 people) in respective sub-project area&#13;
represents about: in Kesrouan 22 percent; in Saida 53 percent; in Sour 39 percent; and in Nabatiye 55&#13;
percent. The annual population growth rate has been assumed to about equal the national average of 2.18&#13;
percent. Present population in the sub-project areas corresponds to 20 - 25 percent of the total population in&#13;
Lebanon.&#13;
B. Present Water Supply and Wastewater Systems&#13;
3.     Present water supply situation in respective sub-project area is summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)    in Kesrouan: The distribution systems cover the total population in the sub-project area&#13;
with water provided from the following springs and groundwater sources: Madiq, Jiita,&#13;
Nabaa el Aassal, Afqa, and Nabaa Farah. Connections between the systems enable the&#13;
transfer of water between different areas in accordance with the seasonal yields of&#13;
respective water source.  Both the water production and distribution capacity are&#13;
inadequate for present water demand;&#13;
(b)    in Saida: The whole sub-project area is covered by a distribution system with water&#13;
supplied from springs and groundwater. The water supply is presently inadequate, but this&#13;
will improve with works being carried out under the National Emergency and&#13;
Rehabilitation Program (NERP);&#13;
(c)    in Sour: The public water supply systems cover 80 percent of the sub-project area, which&#13;
is divided into seven distribution zones. Area not covered is provided with water from&#13;
private wells or through tankers. There are four main water sources: Ras el Ain basins&#13;
(providing about 21,800 m 3/day), Er Rachidiye spring (about 6,000 m 3/day), Quadi Jilo&#13;
wells (about 10,000 m3 /day); and public and private wells (about 24,800 m /day). The&#13;
distribution systems are in poor conditions, there are no water meters and unaccounted for&#13;
water is estimated at 50 percent. The water supply is inadequate and there is a need for an&#13;
extension of both the production and the distribution capacity; and&#13;
(d)    in Nabatiye: The existing water supply system, which is divided into 9 subsystems serving&#13;
52 villages and extending over an area of some 340 km2, is centered on the urban area of&#13;
Nabatiye, and rural agglomerations north of the Litani River and south of the coastal city of&#13;
Saida. Although there are no unserved areas, the system is in a state of disrepair. Existing&#13;
water supplies, which are inadequate as well as their treatment, derive from Nabaa El Tasse&#13;
Spring (an allocation of 8,000 m-3/day out of a sustainable yield of 18,000 m3/day), two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1                                                                                    3&#13;
regional boreholes (Fakhreddine and Insariye) and from 27 village boreholes providing in&#13;
total a sustainable yield of 37,105 m3/day.&#13;
4.     Present wastewater collection and disposal situation is summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)    in Kesrouan: The sub-project area is served by one major network, connecting about 48&#13;
percent of the population, with discharge of untreated wastewater either in the valleys or&#13;
through short outfall mains into the sea within or close to beaches used for recreational&#13;
purposes. The capacity of existing network, pumping stations, pressure mains, and sea&#13;
outfalls can barely cope with present wastewater flows. On-site facilities are septic tanks&#13;
and soak-aways, which depending on the permeability of the soil either overflow into&#13;
adjacent storm water drains or cause groundwater pollution;&#13;
(b)    in Saida: The sub-project area is served by 22 separate networks, connecting about 75&#13;
percent of the population, with discharge of untreated wastewater either in adjacent creeks&#13;
or through short outfall mains into the sea. Remaining area is served with on-site cesspools&#13;
or septic tanks. All the networks operate by gravity. The present system is causing&#13;
significant environmental pollution. Operation and maintenance are neglected due to lack&#13;
of adequate staffing and institutional structure;&#13;
(c)    in Sour: The sub-project area has a rather undeveloped wastewater infrastructure with&#13;
only about 35 percent of the population connected to the system mainly in the city of Sour.&#13;
Untreated wastewater is discharged directly into the sea through a large number of short&#13;
outfall mains causing an unacceptable high level of bacterial contamination along&#13;
surrounding beaches. The remainder of the area is served by poorly designed and&#13;
constructed septic tanks or soak-aways polluting the groundwater supplies. The discharge&#13;
of septic waste is unorganized and environmentally unsatisfactory; and&#13;
(d)    in Nabatiye: In the sub-project area only the town of Nabatiye is served with a wastewater&#13;
collection system, with a connection rate of about 60 percent (or 14,000 people).  No&#13;
treatment facilities exist and wastewater is discharged close to residential areas. Sewers are&#13;
laid at shallow depths and are easily damaged posing danger to adjacent low pressure water&#13;
mains.&#13;
C. Design Criteria&#13;
5.    In 1975 sixteen states bordering the Mediterranean Sea adopted the Mediterranean Action Plan&#13;
(MAP) for the protection and development of the Mediterranean Basin. The legal framework for the&#13;
MAP was determined at a conference in Barcelona in 1976 with additional protocols adopted in Athens,&#13;
1980, and Geneva, 1982. The objective adopted by all Mediterranean countries was the construction of&#13;
secondary wastewater treatment plants in all coastal cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants and&#13;
appropriate outfalls andlor treatment plants in all towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants. The&#13;
signatories of the MAP have adopted the WHO/UNEP faecal coliform (FC) standard for recreational&#13;
water suitable for bathing. It allows in at least 10 samples taken during the bathing season no more than:&#13;
100 FC per 100 ml in 50 percent of the samples; and 1000 FC per 100 ml in 90 percent of the samples.&#13;
Under the project (all three coastal sub-project areas exceed the limit of 100,000 people) it is proposed,&#13;
in a first phase, to provide for preliminary treatment with outfall mains to be designed to satisfy the FC&#13;
standard. In a subsequent phase secondary treatment will be added, for which the timing will be subject&#13;
to the results from proposed coastal environmental monitoring. However, for Sour it has proved to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                                                   Annex I&#13;
feasible to provide for secondary treatment already in a first phase and to use the treated effluents for&#13;
irrigation.&#13;
6.     For the extension or improvements of water supply and wastewater services, the following&#13;
criteria have been adopted: the per capita water consumption has been assumed not to exceed 150&#13;
liter/day; un-accounted for water, which is presently very high, would be reduced to about 25 percent of&#13;
water produced; wastewater and storm water should be collected and discharged in separate networks;&#13;
industrial effluents should be pre-treated where required; and satisfactory arrangements should be made&#13;
for the servicing of septic tanks. The planning horizon for the project is 2015, but for works that cannot&#13;
feasibly be extended in phases, such as trunk mains and submarine outfall mains, the design period has&#13;
been determined to 2030.&#13;
D. Project Description&#13;

(d)    for the Nabatiye sub-project area: supplying and installing 2.1 kms of collection mains.&#13;
E. Evaluation of Alternatives&#13;
9.    Works proposed for implementation have been evaluated as least-cost solutions taking&#13;
into account capital investments as well as operation and maintenance costs. The initial&#13;
extension of pretreatment works for Kesrouan and Saida, with environmental concerns properly&#13;
considered, is more economical than to provide for full treatment in a first phase. Neither was it&#13;
found economical to use treated effluents for irrigation. However, for Sour where it is feasible to&#13;
use treated effluents for irrigation and where the flat topography for the outfall main makes&#13;
preliminary treatment uneconomical, full treatment will be provided for initially. Alternative&#13;
locations for the treatment works and outfall mains were evaluated. Alternative alignments of&#13;
the trunkmains have been evaluated as well as the choice between deep trenching and the use of&#13;
lift pumping stations.  The preferred alignments are also least disturbing to surrounding&#13;
population and to the traffic.&#13;
10.   For the extension of water supply facilities the evaluation of alternative solutions has&#13;
taken into account: (a) the availability of potential water resources; (b) tunnels versus large&#13;
transmission mains; (c) location and elevation of storage tanks; (d) and relevant costs at&#13;
different standards of service levels.&#13;

LEBANESE REPUBLIC&#13;
COASTAL POLLUTION CONTROL AND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Assessment&#13;
A. Environmental Review Process&#13;
1.    The project has been placed in environmental screening category "A" consistent with the&#13;
provisions of Operational Directive 4.01. Environmental Assessments (EAs) were undertaken for the&#13;
water supply and wastewater facilities for each of the four sub-project areas in Kesrouan, Saida, Sour and&#13;
Nabatiye. The EAs are available in the Project File.&#13;
B. Existing Environmental Conditions and Project Benefits&#13;
2.    Wastewater, centrally collected, is mainly disposed of untreated through a number of short&#13;
outfall mains along the coast and to a minor extent in nearby surface water streams. For individual&#13;
wastewater facilities, septic tanks and soak-aways, the effluent infiltrates into the ground. Areas close to&#13;
wastewater outlets into the sea have shown bacteriological pollution, and the Ministry of Environment&#13;
(MOE) has closed some beaches for bathing because of public health risks. According to a UNICEF&#13;
estimate, based on a 1991 study, some 80 percent of public water supplies in Lebanon were polluted.&#13;
The EAs predict that through the project there will be a general improvement in public health conditions,&#13;
and that beaches for recreation along the coastal areas of Kesrouan, Saida and Sour will be restored.&#13;
Furthermore, the provision of new and the rehabilitation of defunct wasterwater collection mains will&#13;
eliminate or significantly reduce the risk for bacteriological pollution of groundwater and local springs.&#13;
C. Consultations with Government Agencies and Affected Groups&#13;
3.    A public consultation meeting was held in Sour with representatives from local municipalities,&#13;
community associations, social institutions and the Public Hospital. In Kesrouan and Saida, discussions&#13;
were held with the owners and managers of large industries and with municipal authorities. Similar&#13;
meetings have taken place in Nabatiye. Information collected and opinions expressed were incorporated&#13;
into the project concept and proposed mitigation measures.&#13;
D. Environmental Evaluation of Alternatives&#13;
4.    The basic project concept - which is similar for the sub-project areas in Kesrouan, Saida and&#13;
Sour, while works in the Nabatiye sub-project area are more in the nature of rehabilitation - consists of:&#13;
(i) extension and rehabilitation of water supply systems including water sources, water treatment works&#13;
and storage tanks, and transmission and distribution mains; and (ii) extension and rehabilitation of&#13;
wastewater collection systems with the construction of treatment works and sub-marine outfall mains. In&#13;
a first stage, preliminary treatment will be provided for Kesrouan and Saida, while secondary treatment&#13;
will, initially, be provided for Sour. The design criteria for the wastewater treatment works and the sub-&#13;
marine outfall mains are shown in Annex 1.   For Kesrouan and Saida sufficient land will be&#13;
purchased to enable a later extension with secondary treatment, for which the timing will be decided&#13;
through a monitoring of the coastal water quality. For Sour the treated wastewater will be discharged for&#13;
part of the year into an irrigation canal for reuse. Any reuse of treated wastewater in Kesrouan and Sour&#13;
has not been proved to be feasible. During project preparation alternative solutions and related&#13;
environmental aspects have been analyzed. Least cost solutions have been selected, which also will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                                     Annex 8&#13;
ensure optimal environmental benefits. The site selected for the wastewater treatment works in Sour will&#13;
require relocation of about 12 people. A relocation plan satisfactory to the Bank has been agreed with&#13;
the Government.&#13;
E. Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures&#13;
5.     Environmental mitigation measures developed in the EAs are summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)    Impacts related to the siting and routing of facilities: During the feasibility studies&#13;
the siting of various works was done in view of avoiding: (i) relocation of housing; (ii)&#13;
encroachment on historical and cultural property; (iii) blocking visual and physical&#13;
access to beach areas; (iv) locations close to touristic and dense housing areas where&#13;
many people may be affected by bad odors; (v) conflicts with future planned land uses;&#13;
and (vi) conflicts with commercial fishing.&#13;
(b)    Impacts related to design of facilities and equipment:  The most critical project&#13;
components are the wastewater treatment works and the sub-marine outfall mains.&#13;
Criteria have been established for the design, which will be based on data to be gathered&#13;
and analyzed during an oceanographic survey covering a one year period. A monitoring&#13;
program for the coastal waters will be carried out, and land at the treatment sites has&#13;
been reserved for a later extension to secondary treatment.  The timing for such&#13;
extension will depend on the results from the monitoring. This concludes that provisions&#13;
have been made for initial and potential future requirements. The sludge to be collected&#13;
at the preliminary treatment works will be disposed of at sanitary landfills. For Sour&#13;
where oxidation ponds have been proposed, sludge handling will not pose a problem.&#13;
(c)    Short-term  impacts during construction activities.  Mitigation will be achieved&#13;
through the integration of relevant clauses into construction specifications and on-site&#13;
supervision of construction works. Specific matters to be addressed are: disturbance to&#13;
traffic, damages to existing infrastructure and utilities, accidental discharges of&#13;
lubricants, fuels, and other toxic materials, soil erosion and dust creation, contouring and&#13;
landscaping, disposal of surplus soil, protection of cultural properties, solid waste&#13;
disposal, and excessive noise. An associated impact of construction is expansion of&#13;
existing as well as development of new aggregate quarries. Lebanon, however, has new&#13;
regulations to control excessive noise and dust from quarries, that require preparation of&#13;
rehabilitation plans upon closure of such sites to ensure re-vegetation and re-integration&#13;
into the landscape.&#13;
(d)    Long-term impacts during operations. Major long-term impacts may occur if the&#13;
above mitigation measures are not carried out, or if there is improper operation and&#13;
maintenance of the water supply and wastewater facilities. As stated under (b), the&#13;
monitoring program will indicate the timing for the need of improved wastewater&#13;
treatment. Routine analysis of potable water will show any deficiency in disinfection,&#13;
which then will be corrected. Agreement has also been reached on the discharge of&#13;
harmful industrial effluents into the wastewater collection system and before January 1,&#13;
2000, on-site pretreatment should be in place as required. This would ensure that&#13;
These are specified in Annex l and 2 of the Land Based Sources Protocol.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8                                                                                      3&#13;
wastewater discharged into the system can also be satisfactorily disposed of through the&#13;
treatment works and outfall mains.&#13;
F. Environmental Monitoring Plan&#13;
6.     The environmental monitoring plan will be similar for each of the coastal sub-project areas. The&#13;
monitoring will include to the extent required: (i) physical oceanographic measurements (currents,&#13;
vertical profiles of temperature, oxygen, salinity, light attenuation and fluorescence); (ii) seawater&#13;
chemical analyses (pH, chlorophyll, suspended solids, total nitrogen, ammonia N, nitrate and nitrites,&#13;
total P, inorganic-reactive P, bacteriological quality); (iii) bathing water quality at beaches adjacent to&#13;
the sea outfalls (visual and bacteriological quality); and (iv) fish, benthic and shellfish in proximity to the&#13;
sea outfalls to qualitatively and quantitatively estimate the effects of effluent discharge. Monitoring will&#13;
commence prior to construction of the outfalls and continue during the construction period and&#13;
subsequently during operations. Water quality at springs and groundwater aquifers will be monitored to&#13;
ensure conformance with public health standards. Terms of reference for the preparation of a monitoring&#13;
program are available in the Project File.&#13;
G. Environmental Institutional Issues&#13;
7.     The principal institutions responsible for ensuring satisfactory environmental conditions for the&#13;
provision of water supply and for the collection and disposal of wastewater will be the MHER and MOE&#13;
at the national level and the RWSICs/RWSCs (see Annex 9) at the regional level. Technical support to&#13;
be provided under the project will enable relevant entities to better address environmental issues related&#13;
to the delivery of water supply and wastewater services. For project execution, consultants have been&#13;
appointed with environmental specialization. This also applies to the SIU or its successor, which will&#13;
remain responsible for project management.&#13;

LEBANESE REPUBLIC&#13;
COASTAL POLLUTION CONTROL AND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Sector Reforms&#13;
1.    The Government of Lebanon (GOL) has developed a policy and strategy framework for water&#13;
and wastewater sector reforms.  The framework, including arrangements to be made for its&#13;
implementation, is elaborated upon in the following paragraphs.&#13;
A. Water Sector Policy&#13;
2.    The main features of the GOL's water sector policy, which has been translated into a draft law,&#13;
are:&#13;
(a)   Investments in water supply, wastewater, and irrigation should support the GOL's&#13;
overall development objectives and reflect its environmental policies and standards.&#13;
(b)    Sector investments should be based on economic and financial least-cost solutions to&#13;
identified problems, and should conform to the GOL's water resource allocation and&#13;
utilization policies and guidelines.&#13;
(c)    All costs for the provision of water supply, wastewater and irrigation services (operation&#13;
and maintenance, loan amortization) should be borne by the users, through the payment&#13;
of tariffs, fees and taxes, to ensure long-term sustainability; tariffs are the preferred&#13;
method since they can readily reflect the actual costs for the services.&#13;
(d)    GOL may provide short-tern financial assistance for population groups unable to meet&#13;
such requirements immediately, under guidelines and criteria of eligibility to be&#13;
determined from time to time, but in any event only after all possibilities of internal&#13;
cross-subsidies have been fully exhausted.&#13;
(e)    Sector policy and regulatory functions should be assigned to national organizations, and&#13;
executive functions should be the responsibility of regional and local organizations.&#13;
These regional and local organizations, publicly-owned, should operate on a commercial&#13;
basis following a business plan, which clearly defines objectives and ensures the&#13;
organization's financial viability, and which is approved by the organization's board and&#13;
the tutelage ministry.&#13;
(f)    Authority and responsibility for operation and maintenance of services should be vested&#13;
in the lowest level of organization capable of assuming this function. Regional&#13;
organizations should be given the authority to devise systems of local operation of&#13;
facilities and to provide technical assistance to communities willing to operate and&#13;
maintain their own facilities. This would combine the benefits of economy of scale (e.g.,&#13;
central purchasing, common management, major repair facilities) with the benefits of&#13;
local administration.&#13;
(g)    The private sector should be encouraged to carry out specific activities (such as&#13;
equipment maintenance), or to assume all service functions (such as management of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                                    Annex 9&#13;
entire systems), wherever this would result in better efficiency and provision of better&#13;
services.&#13;
(h)    Users should be consulted prior to investment decisions regarding service levels and&#13;
standards and related costs, and in rural areas operation and maintenance should, to the&#13;
extent feasible, be based on community participation.&#13;
(i)    To reduce investment costs and to ensure adequate operation and maintenance of works,&#13;
selected technologies should be adjusted to suit local, cultural, financial and physical&#13;
conditions and the operational capacity of respective community.&#13;
B. Institutions&#13;
3.     The objectives under the sector reforms would be achieved through the development of the&#13;
following institutions:&#13;
At the National Level&#13;
(a)    A National Water Resource Authority (NWRA) should be responsible for the strategic&#13;
planning of water resources development and for their allocation to different users.&#13;
These functions are initially proposed to be the responsibility of the Ministry of&#13;
Hydraulics and Electric Resources (MHER) with, based on experience to be gained, the&#13;
creation of NWRA in a subsequent phase under the tutelage of MHER.&#13;
(b)    A Finance Regulatory Commission (FRC) should be responsible for setting cost&#13;
recovery, tariff, accounting and auditing policies, for monitoring the financial&#13;
performance of operating entities, and for reviewing and approving tariff proposals for&#13;
water supply, wastewater and irrigation services.&#13;
(c)    The MHER should be responsible for policy and planning functions, such as:&#13;
*   strategic planning for the sector, including regulation of private sector participation.&#13;
*   establishment of standards on service levels, technical and design matters and on&#13;
operation and maintenance.&#13;
*   issuance of project development and procurement regulations.&#13;
*   determination of the need for, and the provision of, technical assistance.&#13;
*   determination of the need for financial assistance (including the setting of&#13;
conditions and eligibility criteria under which financial aid is to be made available)&#13;
in consultation with FRC.&#13;
*   assistance in human resource development.&#13;
*   monitoring and evaluation of the performance of operating entities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9                                                                               3&#13;
At the Regional Level&#13;
(a)    Regional water supply, sanitation and irrigation companies (RWSIC's) will be&#13;
established for North Lebanon, Beirut and Mount Lebanon, and North Beka'a. Regional&#13;
water supply and sanitation companies (RWSCs) will be established for South Beka'a&#13;
and South Lebanon with the Litani River Authority to remain responsible for irrigation&#13;
(b)    The RWSICs/RWSCs should be autonomous, publicly andlor privately owned, subject to&#13;
commercial law, with Board of Directors, with members from the public and the private&#13;
sectors, appointed to staggered fixed terms to ensure continuity.  The Council of&#13;
Ministers would appoint the chairman of the board and board members representing the&#13;
government upon nomination by the Minister of MHER. The RWSICs/RWSCs should&#13;
be responsible for the provision of water and wastewater services to urban and rural&#13;
areas, with the RWSICs to additionally be responsible for operation and maintenance of&#13;
headworks, pumping stations, main and secondary canals for irrigation systems.&#13;
Responsibility for wastewater should be taken over gradually in pace with the&#13;
development of a capacity for its management.&#13;
(c)    Each RWSIC/RWSC should be autonomous and be able to conduct its business in the&#13;
manner of a commercial entity in accordance with a business plan containing verifiable&#13;
performance targets. The business plan would be updated annually and approved by the&#13;
MHER. Once the business plan has been approved, the RWSICs/RWSCs could proceed&#13;
with its implementation without further authorizations, unless changing conditions&#13;
would necessitate major revisions to be made.&#13;
(d)   In Summary, the RWSICs/RWSCs would be responsible for:&#13;
-  Planning, design and implementation of regional and local programs and projects,&#13;
in accordance with overall plans and strategies developed by the MHER.&#13;
e   Construction, operation and maintenance of facilities.&#13;
e   Management of services, ensuring that the entire population of the region is served.&#13;
*   Proposing and, subject to approval by the FRC, implementing tariffs, as needed, to&#13;
maintain financial viability.&#13;
*   Human resource development and personnel administration.&#13;
* Technical assistance to other executing agencies and local communities.&#13;
*   Coordination with agencies responsible for other complementary services such as&#13;
solid waste and drainage.&#13;
*   Contracting for services to be provided by private enterprises, wherever the benefits&#13;
to the users justify such action.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                                                   Annex 9&#13;
C. Implementation&#13;
4.     For implementation of proposed sector reforms, Government decisions or Parliament resolutions&#13;
should be made or enacted regarding:&#13;
(a)   the creation of the RWSICs/RWSCs with the initial status of authorities through decrees&#13;
to be issued by the Council of Ministers. That will also initiate the development of these&#13;
authorities;&#13;
(b)   the enactment of the draft law based on which the regional authorities can be converted&#13;
into companies and the entities at the national level can be established and developed as&#13;
envisaged; and&#13;
(c)   the establishment and development of the NWRA.&#13;
5.    The sector reforms should be implemented according to the following three phases:&#13;
(a)    Phase 1 (1993-98) will be completed with the enactment of the draft law. It has&#13;
included a review of legislative and regulatory requirements, preparation of a draft law,&#13;
the broad design of proposed organizational structures, the preparation of an outline&#13;
work program for Phase 2, and, as an interim measure, the establishment of regional&#13;
authorities.&#13;
(b)    Phase 2 (1997- 1999) will include actions needed for the establishment and development&#13;
of the FRC and the RWSICs/RWSCs and the restructuring of the MIHER. It will also&#13;
cover the preparation of an action program for the implementation of Phase 3.&#13;
(c)    Phase 3 (1999-2002) will support the various sector entities in their start-up and initial&#13;
operation, which will include the provision of technical assistance, training, and&#13;

E. Proposed Technical Assistance&#13;
7.     Proposed technical assistance (TA) will include the following major components:&#13;
(a)    the provision of an Institutional Specialist;&#13;
(b)    the provision of consultant services as required under phase 2 of sector reforms;&#13;
(c)    the provision of technical assistance and management contracts as required under phase&#13;
3 of sector reforms; and&#13;
(d)    the provision of independent auditors to review performance under technical assistance&#13;
and management contracts.&#13;
Components (b) and (c) have been further elaborated upon in below paragraphs, for which terms of&#13;
reference/request for proposals have been prepared and are available in the Project File.&#13;

LEBANESE REPUBLIC&#13;
COASTAL POLLUTION CONTROL AND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Financial and Economic Analysis&#13;
A. Financial Analysis&#13;
1.     Financial analysis of the least-cost investments for the four sub-project areas, Kesrouan, Saida,&#13;
Sour and Nabatiye, summarized in the Attachment to this annex, focuses on affordability of improved&#13;
service by beneficiaries, and on cost recovery of investments by the regional water and sanitation&#13;
companies. Details are included in the Project File (see Annex 11). Differential tariffs with higher&#13;
levels of cost recovery from non-household users (1.5 to 2.5 times) will enable household water supply&#13;
and wastewater charges to remain affordable, remaining below 5 percent of the relevant incomes, in all&#13;
cases.&#13;
2.     External borrowings are assumed to be serviced at terms averaging 7.0 percent, with 5 years&#13;
grace and 15-year repayment, reflecting near commercial terms for on-lending the mix of finance&#13;
provided by the different lenders (Bank US$52 million at 7 percent, Japan US$124 million equivalent at&#13;
3 percent, EIB US$62 million at 4 percent). Together with higher operating expenses, distributed over a&#13;
growing volume of water sold, these determine the annual revenue cover needed. The average costs of&#13;
water and sanitation services per cubic meter of water supplied, thus calculated for Kesrouan, Saida,&#13;
Sour and Nabatiye (US$1.42, 1.03, 0.96 and 0.61 respectively) are based on full cost recovery, i.e.,&#13;
covering all debt-service and operating expenses. Minimal contributions towards future investments (20&#13;
percent of the expected 2006-2015 requirements) and liquidity requirements have been factored as part&#13;
of these projections. Applicable tariffs may, therefore, have to be higher in reality, especially for non-&#13;
household consumers.&#13;
3.     Reviews of existing water authority financial results indicate negative or small operating margins&#13;
that currently can not support future energy and personnel costs to operate new investments. Projected&#13;
income streams, without project implementation, would be negligible. Higher operating costs are,&#13;
therefore, included in the analysis as these reflect delivery of quality service to elicit the cost recovery&#13;
needed. Thus proposed investments, total operating costs and all future cash flows projected would be&#13;
largely incremental&#13;
4.     The limited data on which this analysis is based points to the importance of a regular review of&#13;
water supply and wastewater sector financial data. The bidding process (requests for proposals - RFPs)&#13;
for management contracts for operation and maintenance will provide an opportunity for more detailed&#13;
review.&#13;
Currently, details of charges incurred by area water offices are not completely known, especially those in&#13;
arrears to other public entities (e.g., the power company). Feasibility reports prepared for the project&#13;
assessed operating costs, based on reasonable operating assumptions for Kesrouan, Sour and Saida. These&#13;
will need to be further revised as and when additional information is available, particularly for Nabatiye.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                                     Annex 10&#13;
B. Economic Analysis&#13;
5.            In urban areas the majority of households have access to piped water but receive only&#13;
intermittent service - typically from one to three times a week for periods of about eight hours - of water&#13;
which is generally contaminated. Household water supply is not metered in Lebanon and the charge for&#13;
piped water is based on pipe diameter (orifice) which for most households is sized to deliver one cubic&#13;
meter of water over a 24-hour period with a continuous flow. The annual charge for such a service is:&#13;
Kesrouan      $68 per year&#13;
Saida         $56 per year&#13;
Sour          $50 per year&#13;
Nabatiye      $50 per year&#13;
If the flow of water were to be continuous, the tariff per m3 would be about US$0.16, but the intermittent&#13;
service currently available results in an effective price ranging from about US$0.30 to over US$0.60 per&#13;
m3. Because of the insufficiency of piped supplies in urban areas, these are commonly supplemented by&#13;
tanker delivered water. Outside urban areas, tanker deliveries are a prime source of water supply.&#13;
Surveys undertaken in the three project areas and elsewhere in Lebanon indicate that the charge for&#13;
tanker water is US$0.80 - 1.00 per m3 excluding the price of transport, which increases the delivered&#13;
price to about US$3.00 per m3 in the coastal plains and to US$5.00 per m3 in the mountain areas.&#13;
Drinking water is priced at US$3.75 per 19 liter container (20 cents per liter) or 45 cents for a one and a&#13;
half liter bottle (30 cents per liter).&#13;
6.     Surveys undertaken during project preparation show that for an average household income of&#13;
US$350 per month, the combination of piped water and tanker deliveries results in an average cost of&#13;
US$1.32 per m3. These costs are relatively high in relation to water tariffs in the region and elsewhere.2&#13;
7.    In Kesrouan and Nabatiye sub-project areas,3 the investments made will add additional water&#13;
supply and improve quality of existing water to make it drinkable by reducing infiltration of wastewater&#13;
and by improved treatment. Without taking into account the improvements to existing water supply,&#13;
based on the incremental costs of water supply in these two sub-project areas and the incremental water&#13;
made available as a result of the project, the estimates of long run average incremental cost (LRAIC) per&#13;
m3 for each area, using a 10 percent discount rate, are shown below together with similar estimates for&#13;
wastewater:&#13;

Estimates of the economic benefits for the water supply components are based on the existing price paid&#13;
of US$1.32 per cubic meter for water. The economic rate of return analysis for Kesrouan and Nabatiye&#13;
is shown in Tables I and 2 respectively, and summarized below:&#13;

Notes: Base Case:    Cost and benefit streams for the wastewater components are excluded.&#13;
Scenario A:   Cost streams increased by 20 percent.&#13;
Scenario B:   Benefit streams decreased by 20 percent.&#13;
Scenario C:   Incremental cost stream for the wastewater components are added.&#13;
8.    Although economic benefits can not be truly assessed for the wastewater components without&#13;
quantifying the value of water supply and sanitation improvements as well as health and tourism benefits&#13;
from environmental clean up of beaches and coastal areas, economic rates of return are expected to be&#13;
significantly higher as improved levels of service and assurance of continuous water supply will enable&#13;
improved economic activity to take place.&#13;

2045) at a cost of US$7 million and US$5 million, or 20% of total initial investments for water supply and wastewater components respectively.&#13;
3.     Annual incremental O&amp;M costs are estimated at US$1.55 and US$0.6 million or 2% of applicable investment costs for water supply and wastewater components respectively.&#13;
4.     Incremental revenue generated is based on existing price paid of US$1.32 per cubic meter of water. There is no direct charge for wastewater.&#13;
5.     As a direct result of O&amp;M improvements supported by the project, unaccounted-for-water is assumed to decline by 1 % annually form 39% in 1996 to 25% by 2010.&#13;
6.     At the completion of the project additional water production is projected to be 13.32 MCM per year.&#13;
7.     Cost and benefit streams for the wastewater component are excluded.&#13;

            Lebanon - Coastal Pollution Control and
            Water Supply Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Coastal Pollution
            Control and Water Supply Project are (1) to improve sanitary
            and environmental conditions in three major urban areas of
            the coastal zone; (2) to improve and extend water supply and
            wastewater collection and disposal services in selected
            areas; (3) to reduce groundwater and surface water
            pollution; (4) to restore the recreational use of bathing
            beaches; (5) to ensure satisfactory operation and
            maintenance of equipment installed or rehabilitated under
            the National Emergency Reconstruction Program (NERP); and
            (6) to restructure the sector to improve services through
            commercial operation and increased private sector
            participation.  The project consists of the following major
            components: (1) extending water supply facilities in
            Kesrouan and Nabatiye sub-project areas and wastewater
            collection and disposal systems in Kesrouan, Saida, Sour,
            and Nabatiye sub-project areas; (2) entering into
            countrywide operation, maintenance, and training services
            contracts for mechanical and electrical equipment installed
            or rehabilitated under the NERP, including consumable and
            spare part procurement;  (3) obtaining operation and
            maintenance equipment and office facilities for the five
            regional water authorities and for environmental monitoring;
            and (4) securing consultant services  and technical
            assistance to establish and develop sector institutions
            nationally and regionally, for environmental monitoring, for
            project management, for construction supervision and
            performance review auditing.
