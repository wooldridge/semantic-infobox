&amp;#12;&amp;#12;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
Agriculture plays a key role in the economy of Mozambique. It accounts for 31.8 percent&#13;
of gross domestic product (GDP), providing a livelihood to almost 81 percent of the&#13;
labor force. The majority of production undertaken by smallholder families is for con-&#13;
sumption, and the main staple crops produced in the family agricultural sector are&#13;
maize, sorghum, rice, millet, potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, and beans. Cash crops&#13;
frequently grown by households include cotton, tobacco, copra, cashew nuts, sesame,&#13;
sugar beans, sunï¬&#130;ower, bananas, and sugarcane. Many family farms combine food&#13;
crops with a single cash crop. The majority of Mozambican agriculture is rain fed&#13;
and therefore very sensitive to climatic conditions. Climate change models indicate an&#13;
increased likelihood of extreme weather events such as ï¬&#130;ood, drought, and cyclones&#13;
leading to severe negative impacts on the agricultural sector in Mozambique.&#13;
&#13;
Improved agricultural risk management is one of the core enabling actions of&#13;
the Group of Eightâ&#128;&#153;s (G-8) New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition. The&#13;
Agricultural Risk Management Team (ARMT) of the Agriculture and Environment&#13;
Services (AES) Department of the World Bank, at the request of the G-8, conducted&#13;
an agricultural sector risk assessment in Mozambique with several goals: to provide&#13;
a robust analytical underpinning to the Strategic Plan for the Development of the&#13;
Agrarian Sector (PEDSA) and the National Investment Plan for the Agrarian Sector&#13;
in Mozambique (PNISA), to incorporate agricultural risk perspective into deci-&#13;
sion making, and to build the capacity of local stakeholders in risk assessment and&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
Figure ES.1 shows the annual percentage growth in agriculture value added and the&#13;
impacts of major shocks to the sector. The periods of intense civil war (1985â&#128;&#147;86 and&#13;
1990â&#128;&#147;92), drought (1994), and ï¬&#130;ood (2000) resulted in negative growth rates in the agri-&#13;
cultural sector. Since 2000, the growth rate has not dipped into negative territory, but&#13;
the occurrence of agricultural risk has had an adverse impact on agricultural growth.&#13;
&#13;
The frequent occurrence of agricultural risks creates food aï¬&#128;ordability and availability&#13;
problems for vulnerable rural populations and urban consumers, and results in sudden&#13;
spikes in the food insecure population (ï¬&#129;gure ES.2).&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;CHAPTER ONE&#13;
INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT&#13;
Agricultural risk management is a central issue that Mozambique faces in develop-&#13;
ment, and multiple stakeholders have analyzed this challenge, sometimes with diï¬&#128;er-&#13;
ent terminology and focusing on varying aspects.1 Risk is considered the probability&#13;
of harmful consequences or expected losses resulting from interactions between nat-&#13;
ural or human-induced hazards and vulnerable conditions.2 This is in comparison&#13;
with trends that are longer term or â&#128;&#156;chronicâ&#128;&#157; patterns (reversible or irreversible) that&#13;
provide context for impact on agriculture or constraints that are existing conditions/&#13;
bottlenecks that hamper the smooth functioning of the sector and lead to suboptimal&#13;
performance. The government of Mozambique has adopted the Strategic Plan for&#13;
Agricultural Development ([PEDSA]3 2010â&#128;&#147;19) that focuses on (i) increasing the avail-&#13;
ability of food in order to reduce hunger through growth in small producer produc-&#13;
tivity and emergency response capacity; (ii) enlarging the land area under sustainable&#13;
management and the number of reliable water management systems; (iii) increasing&#13;
access to the market through improved infrastructures and interventions in marketing;&#13;
and (iv) improving research and extension for increased adoption of appropriate tech-&#13;
nologies by producers and agro-processors.&#13;
&#13;
To help implement PEDSA, in May 2013 the government adopted the PNISA, which&#13;
has also been accepted by all the major stakeholders as the roadmap for national&#13;
agricultural development. Components of the 2010â&#128;&#147;19 PEDSA seek to minimize and&#13;
mitigate agricultural risks as well as to prepare the sector for dealing with climate&#13;
change. There are also World Bank operations of note involved in making the sector&#13;
more resilient and improving access to predictive information for farmers and early&#13;
warning systems including the ongoing climate change development policy operation&#13;
&#13;

  Related reports that address aspects of agricultural risks include, among others: (FAO/WFP, 2010); (SETSAN, 2010);&#13;
(IFPRI, 2011); the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Agribusiness Indicators: Mozambique (2012); (System), 2012); (FEWSNET, 2006);&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;CHAPTER TWO&#13;
MOZAMBIQUEâ&#128;&#153;S AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM&#13;
Agriculture plays a key role in Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s economy, making up 31.8 percent of&#13;
GDP and providing a livelihood to almost 81 percent of the labor force (CIA 2013).&#13;
The majority of Mozambican agriculture is rain fed and therefore very sensitive to&#13;
climatic conditions.&#13;
&#13;
The agricultural sector in Mozambique is dominated (99 percent) by smallholder farmers&#13;
using family labor, most of whom cultivate small plots of land (0.5 to 1.5 hectares [ha]) with&#13;
limited inputs and mechanization.5 According to data from the Mozambique Agricultural&#13;
Census (TIA) surveys, the total farmer population is estimated at 3.8 million. Producers&#13;
were organized into small organizations and forums, although these only accounted for&#13;
7.2 percent of farmers in 2008 (Government of Mozambique 2008).&#13;
&#13;
Following the Mozambique civil war, which ended in October 1992, increases in agri-&#13;
cultural production have been credited for a reduction in poverty, as people were able&#13;
to return to previously abandoned land. Despite the increased use of land for agricul-&#13;
tural activity, low productivity is still considered a major constraint on development&#13;
(Cungara and Garret 2011).&#13;
&#13;
Mozambique is facing a natural resources boom, and agricultural exports have&#13;
declined from 31.4 percent of total export revenue in 2002 to 14.4 percent in 2008&#13;
because of large-scale expansion of aluminum and electricity exports (World Bank&#13;
2012a). Even so, the agricultural sector remains largely responsible for job creation&#13;
and the government and donors alike consider agricultural development as a driving&#13;
force for poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
AGRO-ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS&#13;
The agro-ecological zones in Mozambique include three macro-agro-ecological&#13;
zones: northern, central, and southern. These macro-agro-ecological zones are based&#13;
on climate, vegetation, altitude, soils, and farming systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5&#13;
    A national survey in 2007 found that only 4 percent of farmers use fertilizer (FAO/WFP 2010).&#13;

These three macrozones, are composed of 10 diverse agro-&#13;
ecological zones. They are pictured here in ï¬&#129;gure 2.1.&#13;
Arid and semiarid zones dominate the south and south-&#13;
west, whereas subhumid zones make up the majority of&#13;
the center and north, and humid highlands are found pri-&#13;
marily in the central provinces (United Nations Food and&#13;
Agriculture Organization [FAO]/World Food Programme&#13;
[WFP] 2010). Agriculture is practiced in all zones, with the&#13;
exception of highly arid regions in the south and south-&#13;
west part of Gaza province, which are only suitable for&#13;
livestock. As noted in appendix B, this is due in particular&#13;
to the increased incidence of extreme climatic events. The&#13;
impact of climate change, if not addressed, may reverse&#13;
progress made in agricultural development.&#13;

This chapter considers the types of risks that are observed in the agricultural sector&#13;
and groups them into three main categories: production, market, and enabling envi-&#13;
ronment. This chapter is a synthesis of analysis conducted by the assessment team as&#13;
well as detailed review of secondary data. A detailed weather analysis (appendix B)&#13;
was conducted to understand weather patterns (deï¬&#129;cit and excessive rainfall) and their&#13;
impact on crop yields. Appendix C reviews the existing literature on climate change&#13;
and appendix D summarizes the vulnerability situation in Mozambique. Detailed com-&#13;
modity risk proï¬&#129;les highlight principal risks to nine major commodities in appendix E.&#13;
&#13;
PRODUCTION RISKS&#13;
The main sources of production risk observed through analysis of data and inter-&#13;
views with numerous farmers are drought, ï¬&#130;ood, cyclone, and pests and diseases.&#13;
Figure 3.1 shows the annual percentage of growth in agriculture value added and the&#13;
declines that occur around major shocks to the sector. The periods of intense civil war&#13;
(1985â&#128;&#147;96 and 1990â&#128;&#147;92), drought (1994), and ï¬&#130;ood (2000) resulted in negative growth&#13;
rates in agriculture. Since 2000, the growth rate has not dipped into negative territory,&#13;
although it has reï¬&#130;ected the impact of several critical events (ï¬&#129;gure 3.1).&#13;
&#13;
The weather analysis in appendix B provides further information on provincial trends&#13;
in rainfall using data from 31 weather stations from January 1979 to December 2009.&#13;
The climate is considered humid tropical in the north and on the coast, and dry tropi-&#13;
cal in the south and interior (Bay 1997). Soils with good agricultural potential exist in&#13;
the north, central, and western parts of the country and those with limited potential&#13;
occur in the southern part, in the low plateau (Bay 1997). The rainy season occurs in&#13;
November/December and lasts until March/April. Annual rainfall is generally up to&#13;
400 mm in the south and central western areas and more than 1,200 mm in the north.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DROUGHT&#13;
Drought was observed to be the most important agricultural risk, considered probable&#13;
and with catastrophic consequences. An agricultural drought occurs when soil moisture&#13;
is signiï¬&#129;cantly deï¬&#129;cient, resulting in reduced crop yields and output. This can be the&#13;

 Coastal urban areas (most        This zone is marked by highly diï¬&#128;erential vulnerability across income groups, with large peri-urban&#13;

                                  cyclones as well as threats of erosion. It is relatively food secure, with low rates of poverty; it&#13;
                                  encompasses the coastal provinces of Maputo, Gaza, Inhambane, Sofala, Zambezia, Nampula,&#13;
                                  and Cabo Delgado but the Central and Northern Provinces are more aï¬&#128;ected.&#13;
 Limpopo river valley districts   This zone is unique in being highly exposed to two very diï¬&#128;erent threats: river ï¬&#130;ooding and&#13;
 upstream of Xai-Xai              drought. It has relatively high population density, and thus high numbers of poor people. Gaza&#13;
                                  and Southern Inhambane are under its inï¬&#130;uence.&#13;
 Other ï¬&#130;ood-prone river valleys   These zones, in particular in the Buzi and Zambezi river valleys, are highly susceptible to ï¬&#130;oods&#13;
                                  (especially those caused by tropical cyclones), but less so to droughts. Sofala and Low Zambezia&#13;
                                  are within this zone.&#13;
 Drought-prone inland areas       These areas are highly susceptible to drought: adequate rainfall to support agriculture is an&#13;
 (especially in the South         exception rather than the rule. Inhabitants of this region are often dependent on remittances&#13;
 Inhambane)                       for survival. Population densities are low.&#13;
 Inland areas of higher           These areas are perhaps the least vulnerable in Mozambique, facing adequate rainfall&#13;
 agricultural productivity        most years, and no extreme risks from ï¬&#130;ooding or tropical cyclones. They are somewhat&#13;
 (including the highly productive heterogeneous in terms of poverty rates and food security. The highly productive regions stand&#13;
 and populated areas in Zambezia) out for their high population density and relatively low vulnerability.&#13;

QUANTIFICATION OF LOSSES AND IMPACT&#13;
OF AGRICULTURAL RISKS&#13;
This chapter outlines the conceptual and methodological basis used for analysis and&#13;
seeks to quantify the impacts of production risk events. The various sources of risk are&#13;
then prioritized on the basis of indicative losses and consideration given as to how to&#13;
manage these risks in chapter 5.&#13;
&#13;
CONCEPTUAL AND METHODOLOGICAL&#13;
BASIS FOR ANALYSIS&#13;
For the purposes of this study, risk is defined as an exposure to a significant&#13;
financial loss or other adverse outcome whose occurrence and severity is unpre-&#13;
dictable but for which some probability of occurrence can be estimated on the&#13;
basis of historical experience. Accordingly, risk implies exposure to substantial&#13;
losses, over and above the normal costs of doing business. In agriculture, farmers&#13;
incur small losses each year caused by moderately adverse climatic conditions and&#13;
fluctuations in output or input prices. Risks discussed here refer to more severe&#13;
and unpredictable events.&#13;
&#13;
INDICATIVE QUANTIFICATION OF LOSSES&#13;
Available data on actual losses caused by adverse events in Mozambique are not par-&#13;
ticularly accurate or consistent within individual data sources. In an attempt to facilitate&#13;
comparison and ranking of the costs and losses caused by various events, diï¬&#128;erent data&#13;
sources were combined to generate a more or less consistent time series. Appendix A&#13;
describes the methodology for quantifying risk. The ï¬&#129;gures used (refer to tables 3.1â&#128;&#147;3.6)&#13;

&amp;#12;BOX 4.1. CROP LOSSES ACCORDING TO THE AGRICULTURAL CENSUS&#13;
  The Mozambique Agricultural Census 2002â&#128;&#147;07 asked small and medium producers (95 percent of all production in Mozam-&#13;
  bique) about the principal cause of crop losses. Figure B4.1.1 takes data from the 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2007 surveys.&#13;
  It can be clearly observed that lack of rain was the largest cause of loss: over 50 percent for maize, rice, and others. Losses&#13;
  attributable to pests and wild animals were lower, although still signiï¬&#129;cant at over 10 percent, whereas ï¬&#130;oods, excess rain,&#13;
  and disease/rot (in other crops) came in at about 5 percent.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;CHAPTER FIVE&#13;
STAKEHOLDER RISK ASSESSMENTS&#13;
How diï¬&#128;erent stakeholder groups perceive and manage production risks varies sig-&#13;
niï¬&#129;cantly depending on the commodity as well as on the priorities and capacities of&#13;
individual stakeholders. The importance and character of market risks for individual&#13;
stakeholder groups is very much a function of the nature and extent of interaction&#13;
with markets. A minority of producers use the market as a source of inputs and an out-&#13;
let for their production to any signiï¬&#129;cant extent. Almost the entire population depends&#13;
on markets to some degree as a source of food. Enabling environment risks also aï¬&#128;ects&#13;
everyone, but again by varying degrees at diï¬&#128;erent points in time.&#13;
&#13;
This chapter discusses the impacts of the range of risks described in chapter 3 on the&#13;
major stakeholder groups, namely, government, producers, consumers, and the most&#13;
vulnerable. Producers are a heterogeneous group that can be diï¬&#128;erentiated in several&#13;
ways, including size of operations and relationships to markets. The vulnerable can&#13;
be considered as components of producer and consumer groups, but are treated sepa-&#13;
rately here in recognition of the severity of the impacts of risk-related events on this&#13;
segment of the population.&#13;
&#13;
This discussion disaggregates the impacts of the risks presented in chapters 3 and 4 by&#13;
stakeholder group indicating which types of risks are most signiï¬&#129;cant to each group&#13;
as well as how the group is aï¬&#128;ected. Although there are insuï¬&#131;cient data for formal&#13;
quantiï¬&#129;cation, the results provide additional guidance for the prioritization of risks&#13;
and their management, which is the focus of chapter 6. In addition to severity and&#13;
frequency of risk-related events, their diï¬&#128;erential impacts on stakeholder groups are&#13;
considered in the prioritization and management response planning processes.&#13;
&#13;
GOVERNMENT&#13;
The impact of agricultural risks is far reaching for governments, particularly when the econ-&#13;
omy and livelihoods are agriculturally dependent, and the government of Mozambique is&#13;
no exception. Not only does it have to provide ï¬&#129;nancing for immediate relief and coping,&#13;
it also incurs loss of revenue from the agricultural sector, reduced GDP, and ï¬&#129;nancial losses&#13;
across the economy. The government has to confront the devastating eï¬&#128;ects on peopleâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;

&amp;#12;CHAPTER SIX&#13;
RISK PRIORITIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
Risks for the agricultural sector diï¬&#128;er signiï¬&#129;cantly from one another not only in their&#13;
character, but also in the severity, frequency, and distribution of their impacts on dif-&#13;
ferent areas, commodities, and sections of the Mozambican population. Chapter 3&#13;
describes the major risks aï¬&#128;ecting the agricultural sector. Production-related risks,&#13;
notably drought and ï¬&#130;ood, are prominent, but there are also a range of risks associ-&#13;
ated with markets and the enabling environment. Chapters 4 and 5 attempt to quan-&#13;
tify the losses associated with these major risks and assess their impacts on government&#13;
and consumers as well as diï¬&#128;erent categories of agricultural producers and service&#13;
providers. Special attention has been given to the impacts on the most vulnerable&#13;
groups in this process.&#13;
&#13;
The information and analysis in the preceding chapters enable a prioritization of risks&#13;
according to the magnitude, frequency, and distribution of the impacts of risk-related&#13;
events. However, those results must be matched with measures to more eï¬&#128;ectively&#13;
manage risks to be of use to those aï¬&#128;ected: individuals, communities, private enter-&#13;
prises, and public agencies. There is already an array of programs and activities that&#13;
government, businesses, and individual farmers use to manage risks. Consumers man-&#13;
age higher prices and limited availability for some commodities by substituting with&#13;
others. How eï¬&#128;ective are these activities and how adequate is their coverage? What are&#13;
the options for better managing these risks and which are most feasible to implement&#13;
in Mozambique?&#13;
&#13;
This chapter summarizes the approaches and results of the risk prioritization (see&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Risk Prioritizationâ&#128;&#157;) and risk management (see â&#128;&#156;Risk Managementâ&#128;&#157;) that are the&#13;
focus of this initial phase of the agricultural sector risk assessment study. These ï¬&#129;nd-&#13;
ings in turn provide the background information for an examination of ways in which&#13;
Mozambique can more eï¬&#128;ectively manage risks. It is important to note that diï¬&#131;culties&#13;
in accessing good data and information to assess risks were encountered, which may&#13;
have aï¬&#128;ected the prioritization undertaken. Interventions to better manage the risks&#13;
prioritized, including access to information, are the focus of a proposed second phase&#13;
for this exercise that took place in November 2014.&#13;

the following seven intervention categories might yield the&#13;
greatest risk management beneï¬&#129;ts:                                Expansion of the scale of these interventions would require&#13;
     1. Soil and water conservation (including conserva-         understanding the landscape of interventions, assessing&#13;
         tion agriculture)                                       their relative eï¬&#131;cacy, understanding principal barriers/&#13;
     2. Improved access to extension services                    challenges to success and scale, and identifying leverage&#13;
     3. Improved water management practices                      points and necessary interventions to increase their access&#13;
     4. Access to information (weather, price, diseases,         to a wide majority of agricultural sector stakeholders.&#13;
         early warning, and so on) to farmers                    Assessing solutions to help prioritize speciï¬&#129;c interventions&#13;
     5. Changes in cropping practices, including cropping        to scale up priority programs and putting in place a risk&#13;
         patterns and use of improved varieties                  management implementation plan will be the next steps&#13;

     Â» The amount of land planted in hectares for arable and permanent crops [C]&#13;
       per year was taken from FAOSTAT.&#13;
     Â» The estimated value per hectare of land planted with arable and permanent&#13;
       crops [d] was derived by dividing the ï¬&#129;gure for the share of production from&#13;
       crops/agriculture using constant 2004â&#128;&#147;06 U.S. dollars by the estimated amount&#13;

The World Bank is conducting a study of the relationship that several climatic events&#13;
have on diï¬&#128;erent crop yields for Mozambique. The purpose of the study is to deter-&#13;
mine whether yield is aï¬&#128;ected by climatic events and by how much these events aï¬&#128;ect it.&#13;

A weather database was provided that consists of 31&#13;
weather stations spread across the country with data on a&#13;
daily basis from January 1, 1979, to December 31, 2009.&#13;
The available variables are precipitation, maximum tem-&#13;
perature, and minimum temperature. Figure B.2 shows&#13;
the geographic distribution of the weather stations.&#13;
&#13;
On a general basis, rainfall follows a clear pattern through-&#13;
out the whole country. From November to April rain is&#13;
plentiful but is scarce from May to October it. Figure B.3&#13;
shows the mean cumulative rainfall per month for all the&#13;
stations in each region.&#13;

DROUGHT AND EXCESS&#13;
RAINFALL ANALYSIS&#13;
Because of the rainfall pattern described above, the year&#13;
is not considered to be the calendar year, but rather the&#13;
period from October of the previous year to September&#13;
of the next year, in order to consider that rain falls mainly&#13;
in the Novemberâ&#128;&#147;March period. Instead of showing&#13;
the cumulative rainfall in each year, standardization was&#13;

CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT ASSESSMENT&#13;
ON AGRICULTURE IN MOZAMBIQUE:&#13;
LITERATURE REVIEW&#13;
&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
Agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate change in Mozambique, and the eï¬&#128;ects&#13;
are heterogeneous based on model assumptions and across regions, socioeconomic&#13;
groups, and crops and livestock. There are direct impacts, such as changes in crop&#13;
yields attributable to precipitation changes, and indirect impacts, such as rising food&#13;
prices because of production changes and land tenure conï¬&#130;ict stemming from shifting&#13;
agro-climatic zones. If climate change is left unaddressed, then progress in agricultural&#13;
development, food security, and poverty alleviation in general may be reversed.&#13;
&#13;
In the Mapping the Impacts of Climate Change index under â&#128;&#156;Agricultural Productivity&#13;
Loss,â&#128;&#157; the Center for Global Development ranks Mozambique 85th out of 233 coun-&#13;
tries globally for â&#128;&#156;direct risksâ&#128;&#157; attributable to â&#128;&#156;physical climate impactsâ&#128;&#157; and 28 out&#13;
of 233 for â&#128;&#156;overall vulnerabilityâ&#128;&#157; attributable to â&#128;&#156;physical impacts adjusted for coping&#13;
abilityâ&#128;&#157; (Wheeler 2011). As agriculture accounts for 31.8 percent of the GDP and 81&#13;
percent of the labor force are involved in agriculture, there is great potential for wide-&#13;
spread impact (CIA 2013).&#13;
&#13;
Varying impacts, in combination with numerous approaches to impact studies, make&#13;
it diï¬&#131;cult to generalize the potential eï¬&#128;ects of climate change on agriculture in&#13;
Mozambique. This appendix discusses possible outcomes in the context of agricultural&#13;
productivity and yield.&#13;
&#13;
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS&#13;
     Â» The increase in the likelihood of extreme events caused by climate change, as&#13;
       opposed to changes in average temperature or precipitation, may pose the great-&#13;
       est threat to agriculture in Mozambique. This includes ï¬&#130;ooding, drought, and&#13;
       tropical cyclones. Risk management therefore becomes increasingly important.&#13;

CONCLUSION                                                                RAIN-FED AGRICULTURE&#13;
In Mozambique, negative impacts on agriculture from                       BASED ON THE MEDIAN OF&#13;
climate change will primarily be caused by the increased                  ALL SEVEN GCMS&#13;
likelihood of extreme events such as cyclones and ï¬&#130;ood-&#13;
ing. However, outside of the expected increase in extreme&#13;
events, agriculture in Mozambique will see little change in&#13;
land suitability and yield (see ï¬&#129;gures C.5 through C.13).&#13;
&#13;
Risk management then becomes increasingly important&#13;
as risk incidents increase across the country in a vari-&#13;
ety of manifestations. Among other tools, information&#13;
systems (such as early warning systems, the disaster risk&#13;
database) are paramount to mitigating these risks. Other&#13;
risk management instruments noted throughout this&#13;
agriculture risk assessment will also be crucial to protect&#13;
producers and consumers alike as the uncertainty of cli-&#13;
mate change unfolds.&#13;

&amp;#12;APPENDIX D&#13;
VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS&#13;
The World Bank deï¬&#129;nes vulnerability as exposure to uninsured risk, leading to a socially&#13;
unacceptable level of well-being. An individual or household is vulnerable if it lacks&#13;
the capacity and/or resources to deal with a realized risk. It is generally accepted that&#13;
in low-income countries, rural populations are both poor and vulnerable, and that&#13;
primary risks to these populations may include climate and market shocks (Sarris and&#13;
Karfakis 2006). Vulnerability is a useful lens through which to view shocks, because&#13;
it allows for determination of impacts on populations and who will be most aï¬&#128;ected.&#13;
Vulnerability is discussed here particularly in the context of food security.&#13;
&#13;
SETSAN performs identiï¬&#129;cation of â&#128;&#156;vulnerability to external shocks,â&#128;&#157; measured&#13;
through food security (see tables D.1 and D.2). As of 2009, other leading government&#13;
bodies mandated with addressing the needs of vulnerable groups were the Ministry of&#13;
Women and Social Action (MMAS) and a subordinate institution, the National insti-&#13;
tute for Social Action (INAS) (Waterhouse 2009).&#13;
&#13;
DEFINITIONS&#13;
SETSAN views vulnerability as â&#128;&#156;associated with exposure to risks and [it] determines&#13;
the susceptibility of people, places, or infrastructures to a particular natural disaster.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
The Ministry of Planning and Finance (MPF) deï¬&#129;ned vulnerability as, a â&#128;&#156;lack of&#13;
defense against adversity (including) . . . exposure to external shocks, tension and risks,&#13;
and lack of internal defense, of means to compete without suï¬&#128;ering serious lossesâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
(MPF 2000; Waterhouse 2009).&#13;

nied by substantial growth in credit or input utilization. Developing a PPP&#13;
in agricultural insurance is a long-term objective that requires appropriately sustained&#13;
engagement and high levels of investment from both the public and private sectors. In&#13;
addition, to achieve sustainability and meaningful uptake, it relies on several key pil-&#13;
lars, one of which is an eï¬&#128;ective distribution channel to rural farmers through which&#13;
insurance can be sold. These distribution channels can take many forms, such as rural&#13;
lending institutions, input suppliers, or social welfare payment systems. The main dis-&#13;
tribution channels in Mozambique currently are rural credit and input suppliers, but&#13;
only 2.3 percent of the rural population has access to ï¬&#129;nance (World Bank 2012b); 3.7&#13;
percent has access to credit (World Bank 2012b); and only 10 percent of maize farm-&#13;
ers and 4 percent of rice farmers use improved seeds (Government of Mozambique&#13;
2008). These low levels of outreach in eï¬&#128;ect mean that currently there is not an eï¬&#128;ec-&#13;
tive distribution channel to provide insurance to the vast majority of rural farmers.&#13;
Experience from other countries also suggests that signiï¬&#129;cant investments in weather,&#13;
yield and satellite data collection, and auditing would be required if agricultural insur-&#13;
ance products were to oï¬&#128;er reliable protection to farmers at low cost. Currently, a very&#13;
limited amount of yield data are collected in Mozambique and the weather station&#13;
network is limited. Moreover, the audit procedures for these types of data are not in&#13;
line with international reinsurance standards.&#13;

&amp;#12;Given the signiï¬&#129;cant ï¬&#129;scal burden of developing                                        lending is unlikely to achieve suï¬&#131;cient uptake (and thus&#13;

            Mozambique - Agricultural sector risk
            assessment : risk prioritization
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Agricultural risk management is a
            central issue that Mozambique faces in development, and
            multiple stakeholders have analyzed this challenge,
            sometimes with different terminology and focusing on varying
            aspects. The government of Mozambique has adopted the
            strategic plan for agricultural development (PEDSA 2010-19)
            that focuses on: (i) increasing the availability of food in
            order to reduce hunger through growth in small producer
            productivity and emergency response capacity; (ii) enlarging
            the land area under sustainable management and the number of
            reliable water management systems; (iii) increasing access
            to the market through improved infrastructures and
            interventions in marketing; and (iv) improving research and
            extension for increased adoption of appropriate technologies
            by producers and agro-processors. The World Bank’s
            agriculture sector risk assessment takes a holistic approach
            and relies on long time-series historical data to arrive at
            an empirical and objective assessment of agricultural risks
            and their impacts on Mozambique. This assessment will form
            the basis of the second step, solution assessment, whose
            final findings will inform National Investment Plan for the
            Agrarian Sector in Mozambique (PNISA). This document
            considers the many aspects of assessing risk in the
            Mozambican agriculture sector. Chapter one gives
            introduction and context. Chapter two introduces the major
            characteristics of the agricultural system leading into
            chapter three, which presents a comprehensive picture of the
            risks that exist in the sector. Chapter four, in quantifying
            the risks that have been observed, comments on the losses
            that have been incurred by the sector because of production
            risks, whereas chapter five provides a qualitative
            discussion of how risk has an effect on the different
            stakeholders present in the sector. Chapter six delves into
            the risk prioritization carried out by the team and then
            comments on various management measures. The report
            concludes with chapter six, in which recommendations are
            provided for improving risk management in Mozambique.
