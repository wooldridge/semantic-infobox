ABSTRACT&#13;
The paper analyzes the impact of Chi:Le's Complementary Feeding Program&#13;
(CFP), both on the direct and indirect beneficiaries. The paper describes&#13;
Chile's major nutrition intervention programs and establishes the relative&#13;
importance of the CFP in terms of budgetary expenditures and number of bene-&#13;
ficiaries reached. It briefly reviews the program's past limitations, recent&#13;
reforms and potential effectiveness. Finally, using data from the 1974-75&#13;
National Nutrition Survey, it examines whether participation by beneficiaries&#13;
in the program was responsible for any significant difference in various&#13;
indicators of nutritional wellbeing, once factors such as income, urban/rural&#13;
location, sex and age are taken into account.&#13;

FOOD DISTRIBUTION AND NUTRITION INTERVENTION: THE CASE OF CHIILE&#13;
Chapter I: INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.01      Since 1924 Chile has distributed food to low-income households in&#13;
order to improve the nutritional welfare of its people. The Complementary&#13;
Feeding Program (CFP), one of five major foocl programs currently operating in&#13;
Chile, is the most important in terms of cost: ($48 million in 1977) and&#13;
number of benefic:Laries (more than 1.3 million). With its focus on supplement-&#13;
lng the diets of preschool children (0-5 year olds), this program is believed&#13;
to be targeted to the group where malnutrition is more prevalent and the&#13;
potential effects of an inadequate diet more severe. While several studies&#13;
have been done to determine the program-s participation rates, coverage,&#13;
utilization by low-income households and cost-effectiveness, there Is only a&#13;
limited amount of information on how successful the program has been in&#13;
raising the nutritional status of the target population. Most studies have&#13;
instead emphasized the potential, rather than the actual nutritional benefits&#13;
that have resulted from the program.&#13;
1.02      Two major issues arise here:   (1) to what extent is the food given&#13;
to the household actually ingested by the intended beneficiary and (2) do&#13;
the economic and dietary benefits induced by the program lead to a 'Long-term&#13;
improvement of the nutritional status of the. population. Within these two&#13;
issues there are a host of secondary issues: (i) the extent and incidence of&#13;
malnutrition within specific regions, socioeconomic groups, and at different&#13;
points in time; (ii) the major determinants of calorie and protein intake;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
(iii) the importance of household behavior in determining intrafamily alloca-&#13;
tion of food; and (iv) the most cost-effective delivery system for reaching&#13;
those individuals who are malnourished.&#13;
1.03      The major purpose of this paper is to provide quantitative esti-&#13;
mates of the impact of Chile's Complementary Feeding Program. The analysis&#13;
presented is based upon data collected by the National Nutrition Survey&#13;
of 1974 and upon budgeted expenditures on the CFP for selected years. Two&#13;
methods of evaluating the impact of the program are used. The first method&#13;
tests the hypothesis that the food given to the preschool child is treated&#13;
as an income transfer. Using an age and sex specific calorie demand func-&#13;
tion, the hypothesis can be tested that program participation increases&#13;
nutrient intake over and above the increase generated by an equivalent income&#13;
transfer. The results suggest that the program does result in a statistically&#13;
significant increase in protein intake of young children (5-23) months of&#13;
age) in addition to the effect of the parallel increase in the real income of&#13;
the household. Furthermore, the direct effect appears to be larger (three to&#13;
six times as much) than the income effect. While not significant at a high&#13;
confidence level, a similar direct increase in calorie intake is also measured&#13;
for the same age group of children. In the calorie case the direct increase&#13;
is much larger than the income transfer increase, the ratio between the two&#13;
ranging between 8 and 70 depending on the income of the participants.&#13;
1.04      The second method tests the hypothesis that the nutritional status&#13;
of the population receiving the impact of the program is significantly different&#13;
from the rest of the population, once factors such as income, urban/rural&#13;
location, sex and age have been properly controlled.&#13;
1.05      The results of this test show that weight and height of participants&#13;
are significantly different from the ones of non-participants for people between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
14 and 30 years of age.   In addition to the income effect of the program,&#13;
therefore, these results suggest that continued participation may have resulted&#13;
in substantial long-term improvements of anthropometric characteristics.&#13;
1.06      The analysis performed also showed that demand for calories and&#13;
proteins is significantly correlated to such factors as income, sex, urban/&#13;
rural location, family size, nutrition requirement (as specified in the&#13;
Food and Agriculture Organization/World Heall:h Organization (FAO/WHO) standards&#13;
and age and that the pattern of influence of these different variables tend to&#13;
vary across the main meals.&#13;
1.07      The distribution of nutrients across members of the household&#13;
appear to be skewed in favor of adult males only within the three main&#13;
meals. When additional snacks are taken intD account, the results show&#13;
that food allocation to family members closely conforms to nutritional&#13;
requirements and tends to favor younger children.&#13;
1.08      The paper is divided into four other sections.    Section I] describes&#13;
Chile's major nutrition intervention programs and establishes the relative&#13;
importance of the CFP in terms of budgetary expenditures and number of benefi-&#13;
ciaries reached. Section III reviews the program-s past limitations, recent&#13;
reforms and potential effectiveness. Section IV describes the 1974 National&#13;
Nutrition Survey and summarizes the data from the Metropolitan Zone.. Based on&#13;
these data, the major determinants of an individual's nutrient intalce, height&#13;
and weight are estimated using multiple regression analysis. Section V then&#13;
summarizes the three main conclusions emerging from this analysis.&#13;

Chapter II:    NUTRITION INTERVENTION IN CHILE AND THE RELATIVE&#13;
IMPORTANCE OF THE COMPLEMENTARY FEEDING PROGRAM&#13;
2.01      Chile is similar to other Latin American countries in that it has&#13;
had extensive experience with nutrition intervention programs. Since 1924&#13;
it has distributed milk to children and pregnant and lactating mothers.&#13;
More recently, its efforts include the establishment of nutrition centers&#13;
to rehabilitate severely malnourished children, the provision of breakfasts&#13;
and lunches through the school lunch program and the distribution of a&#13;
monthly food allotment to low-income households via its Minimum Employment&#13;
Program. These activities taken together cost approximately US$80 million&#13;
per year, of which US$9.8 million comes from foreign contributions, thus&#13;
accounting for approximately 10.5% of total government expenditures on&#13;
social welfare--US$756.3 million (see Table 1).&#13;
2.02      As shown in Table 2, of the five major nutrition programs cur-&#13;
rently operating in Chile, the Complementary Feeding Program (CFP) is the&#13;
most important, both in terms of cost and number of beneficiaries reached.&#13;
Without any explicit eligibility criterion, this program serves approxi-&#13;
mately 81% of all children up to the age of 5 and nearly all pregnant and&#13;
lactating women. Under this program, a different type and amount of food&#13;
is provided to each group differentiated according to age. Children between&#13;
O and 2 years receive whole milk (2-3 kg per month) which has been fortified&#13;
with iron and vitamin C. Older children, 2-5 years of age, receive a special&#13;
protein-enriched formula (Fortesan) containing soy and wheat flours in addition&#13;
to powdered milk (1.5 kg per month).&#13;
2.03      While the CFP is still Chile's predominate nutrition interven-&#13;
tion activity, the government has attempted to scale down the program and&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
to improve its effectiveness by targeting the program to the under-5s.&#13;
Simultaneously, it is attempting to focus more attention on the severely&#13;
malnourished child and on changing the environment which creates malnutri-&#13;
tion. Over the next five years, the government plans to make three major&#13;
changes to its nutrition programs:&#13;
(i) the construction of 14 additional nutrition rehabilitation&#13;
centers with a capacity to care for 2,142 severely malnourished&#13;
children per year (26 centers already exist);&#13;
(ii) expansion of its nursery school program with increased emphasis&#13;
on children who live in extreme poverty and suffer some degree&#13;
of malnutrition and whose fathers are alcoholics or unemployed;&#13;
and&#13;
(iii) by 1982 to extend the School Lunch Program to over 75% of the&#13;
children between 6 and 16.&#13;
2.04      These changes do not seem particularly dramatic until they are&#13;
put in terms of their implications as to the percent of the target popula-&#13;
tion reached by each of these programs and the potential costs to the govern-&#13;
ment. The 26 existing nutrition rehabilitation centers, for example,&#13;
currently have the capacity to care for approximately 4,000 children per&#13;
year. With the 14 new centers, this program can potentially rehabilitate&#13;
6,142 severely malnourished children per year. According to data collected&#13;
by the National Health Service (SNS) clinics, covering approximately 80% of&#13;
Chile's population, less than 0.5% of all children under the age of five are&#13;
severely malnourished (below 80% of reference weight for age). When these&#13;
figures are expanded to represent the entire group, they suggest that&#13;
approximately 7,000 children are severely malnourished (1977). Therefore, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
newly-expanded system should have the capacity to reach nearly 9 out 10&#13;
third-degree children. Given that it costs approximately $5 per day and takes&#13;
less than 5 months to rehabilitate a child, the annual operating costs of this&#13;
program, assuming no decline in the stock of third-degrees, will be about $4.5&#13;
million, or nearly two and one-half times that budgeted in 1977.&#13;
2.05      The planned expansion of the nursery school program with its&#13;
focus on low-income households also reflects Chile's increased fiscal com-&#13;
mitment to nutrition-related activities. Since 1970, with the establish-&#13;
ment of the National Council of Nursery Schools (Junta Nacional de Jardines&#13;
Infantiles--JNJI), the number of nursery schools operating in urban areas&#13;
has increased from 56 (4,000 children) to 461 (50,000 children) in 1978.&#13;
Although the government originally intended to extend the program to all&#13;
preschoolers, this proved too ambitious, given fiscal constraints. Conse-&#13;
quently, the government has redefined its objectives and plans to place&#13;
greater emphasis on the needs of the most disadvantaged (approximately&#13;
150,000). This threefold increase implies a program costing approximately&#13;
$14.0 million.&#13;
2.06      By far the most costly and ambitious proposal is the expansion of&#13;
the School Lunch Program. Given resources currently available, it is con-&#13;
sidered impossible to extend the meal program to all children enrolled in&#13;
school. Instead, a survey has been undertaken to determine where the&#13;
greatest proportion of children are malnourished in order to target the&#13;
program by school. Within 5 years, there are plans to extend the program to&#13;
75% of the school population (1.7 million). Therefore, approximately&#13;
280,000 new beneficiaries would have to be brought into the program each&#13;
year. Given that it costs between 36 and 45 cents/ration (800 calories or&#13;
one-third of the child's requirement) and assuming that each child is fed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
180 days, the cost of the program would increase by $20.4 million each&#13;
year. Taken together, these changes suggest: that Chile s expenditures on&#13;
its nutrition intervention programs would have to increase to roughly $200&#13;
million in real terms by 1982, an increase of nearly 20% per year between&#13;
1977 and 1982. This rate of increase is un:Likely, given historical rates&#13;
unless of course external assistance is increased significantly or other&#13;
existing programs cut back. Accepting that these intentions may not be&#13;
realized, are Chile's current activities effective, and can we reasonably&#13;
expect any benefits from continuing and possibly greatly expanded programs in&#13;
this area?&#13;
2.07      Given the fact that the Complementary Feeding Program currently&#13;
accounts for the largest percent of budgeted expenditures and the fact that&#13;
it is the only program for which data are readily available, the remainder&#13;
of this paper focuses on the effectiveness and potential benefits from this&#13;
particular program. Although it would be more desirable to evaluate the&#13;
other programs where expansion is envisioned, this is left for future&#13;
analysis.&#13;

Chapter III: PAST PROBLEMS, RECENT REFORMS, AND POTENTIAL&#13;
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM&#13;
3.01      Since the early 1970s the CFP has undergone a series of changes.&#13;
For the most part, these reforms have been an outgrowth of a curtailment&#13;
in foreign assistance and have had little to do with an explicit decision&#13;
whether or not the actual benefits from supplemental feeding justified its&#13;
costs. Due to the high foreign exchange costs following the curtailment of&#13;
Public Law 480 shipments of milk in the early 1970s, the government ini-&#13;
tiated research into the development of an acceptable locally produced sub-&#13;
stitute. Efforts were also made to reduce the program's costs by targeting&#13;
the program only to children'under the age of five.&#13;
3.02      Studies in the United States and Latin America have indicated&#13;
that targeted food programs are likely to be ineffective for two reasons:&#13;

receive less food at home. 1/&#13;
The Complementary Feeding Program, however, is an exception. Studies indicate&#13;
that participation in the program by low-income households is relatively&#13;
high. In theory, every malnourished child under the age of six should be&#13;
covered by the program, since, by national law, all children in this age&#13;
group are entitled to a free ration of milk. In practice, the major&#13;

constraint is whether a distribution center is located nearby and can be&#13;
easily accessed by the mother. With three major distribution channels--&#13;
by the National Health Services, through its clinics (covering approxi-&#13;
mately 80% of the population); by the National Medical Service for Employees&#13;
(SERMENA); and by the National Association for Educational Assistance and&#13;
Scholarship -- it is estimated that the prcigram reaches nearly all children&#13;
under six and approximately 80% of targeted pregnant and lactating mothers.&#13;
Unlike other SNS health programs where access has been limited due to&#13;
inadequate capacity and strict eligibility criteria (the need to prove&#13;
indigence), prenatal, postnatal, and infant care, in addition to milk&#13;
distribution through the SNS clinics has generally been available. In a&#13;
recent survey of low-income households served by the SNS in the Santiago&#13;
metropolitan area, over 96% of the eligible population was found t:o be&#13;
receiving the prescribed milk allottment.l/ This finding is supported by two&#13;
earlier studies which found between 75 and 78% 2/ of those eligible parti-&#13;
cipating. Both studies also concluded that more than 75% of participating&#13;
household secured the allotted quantities of milk for all beneficiaries in the&#13;
family, and that nearly 90% of these households obtained milk on a regular&#13;
basis.&#13;
3.03      Even though the program may be reaching preschool children that&#13;
are at nutritional risk, it is questionable whether the food supplement&#13;
given under the program actually improves the child's nutritional status.&#13;
Because CFP is a take-home rather than an on-site feeding program, the food&#13;

can be shared with other members of the family. It is believed that actions&#13;
taken by the National Food and Nutritional Council (CONPAN) to acidify the&#13;
milk and to educate the family as to the importance of the food being given to&#13;
the child has reduced intrafamily leakages. According to research by the SNS,&#13;
this has resulted in the children receiving over 80% of the milk provided.&#13;
Nevertheless, whether this increase in milk intake (food supplement) actually&#13;
results in a net increase in nutrient intake is still an issue. Even if the&#13;
child were to receive all of the supplement, it is still possible for the&#13;
mother to merely reduce the amount of food normally given to the child. What&#13;
ultimately happens when supplementation occurs is believed to depend on how&#13;
the family perceives the food that is distributed by the government. If the&#13;
supplement is seen as an increase in food for the household and not as a&#13;
necessary addition to a child's diet, then the likelihood that substitution&#13;
will occur is increased.&#13;
3.04      Without data on an individual child's nutritional status both&#13;
before and after supplementation, it is impossible to directly estimate the&#13;
impact of this type of food distribution program. Because this information&#13;
is not available, two indirect methods, both based on multiple regression&#13;
analysis, will be used in this study. The first method consists of estimat-&#13;
ing calorie demand functions, by meal, while the second method is based on&#13;
the estimation of functions that relate individual weight and height to&#13;
program participation, age, income, sex, family size and location. The data&#13;
for performing both of these analyses of CFP impact is taken from the&#13;
National Nutrition Survey of 1974/75.&#13;

Chapter IV. INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF MALNIJTRITION IN CHILE: SOME&#13;
RESULTS FROM THE 1974 NATIONAL NUTRITION SURVEY&#13;
4.01      Chile is not a food-deficit country in the sense of many Asian or&#13;
African countries. Calorie availability per capita (2,734 calorie/capita/day&#13;
in 1972-74) is well above average per capita requirements (2,400 calorie/day). 1/&#13;
The problem is instead one of distribution both between households in different&#13;
income groups and between the individual members of the family. Three studies&#13;
one done in 1933 under the auspices of the League of Nations, a secon,l done in&#13;
1960 by the Interdepartmental Committee on Nutrition for National Defense (ICNND),&#13;
and a third in 1968-69 by the Chilean National. Institute of Statistics provide&#13;
information on the distribution of calorie consumption by income class. According&#13;
to these studies, food consumption among Chile's low-income groups did not increase&#13;
by any significant degree between 1935 and 1970. In addition, approximately one-&#13;
third of the households were consistently consuming less than the amount of&#13;
calories necessary to meet the family's overall requirement. 2/ BeccLuse these&#13;
past studies referenced the household as the basic unit of measurement and not&#13;
the individual, they were unable to assess the incidence of malnutrition or,&#13;
simply stated, the degree to which specific individual members of a Family or of&#13;
different age and sex categories suffer nutritional deprivation.&#13;
4.02      The analysis presented in this section is based upon data collected by&#13;
the National Nutrition Survey of 1974/75. 3/ This survey is unique in that it is&#13;

one of the few nationally based surveys which have recorded food intakes&#13;
for individual members of the family, in addition to dietary, anthropometric,&#13;
clinical and biochemical statistics on children. The purpose of this section&#13;
is to describe the types of information collected by the survey, to discuss&#13;
the method used to correct for the fact the survey did not record meals eaten&#13;
away from the home, and then based upon the relationships implied by the&#13;
data to give a summary of the major determinants of calorie and protein&#13;
intake for individuals with different characteristics and to estimate the net&#13;
increase in calorie and protein intake due to participation in the Comple-&#13;
mentary Feeding Program.&#13;
Description of the Survey&#13;
4.03      The 1974 National Nutrition Survey was carried out between June&#13;
1974 and June 1975 through the Nutrition Division of the Directorate-General&#13;
of the National Health Service. The sample collected information from urban&#13;
and rural areas in four major geographic areas. North Planning Zone&#13;
(provinces from Tarapaca to Coquimbo); Metropolitan Planning Zone (provinces&#13;
from Aconcagua to Colchagua); Center-South Planning Zone (provinces from&#13;
Curico to Malleco); and South Planning Zone (provinces from Cautin to&#13;
Magallanes). Information was collected in five general areas: socioeconomic,&#13;
anthropometric, clinical, dietetic, and biochemical. Approximately 4,800&#13;
households were surveyed for data in the first three areas while a smaller&#13;
subsample of 1,600 households was used to collect additional information&#13;
on dietetic patterns and biochemical data.&#13;
4.04      As can be seen in Table 3, the number of households selected&#13;
within each region is inconsistent with previous census estimates of the&#13;
population living in each of these four macro-zones. The five provinces&#13;
that comprise the metropolitan zone, for example, accounted for approxi-&#13;
mately 50% of Chile's total population in 1970. However, the number of&#13;

households sampled in this zone was only one-fourth of the total. Conse-&#13;
quently, the data from each of the four zones can not be weighted equally&#13;
when deriving national inferences. Despite this fact, the survey data can&#13;
be used to test behavioral hypotheses on how individuals daily calorie&#13;
intake and nutritional status is affected by different factors such as&#13;
income, family size and location.&#13;
4.05      The results presented in this section relate only to the sample&#13;
of 400 households from the Metropolitan Zone. Given an average family size&#13;
of 4.7, these households account for 1900 individuals or roughly 1/10,000&#13;
people living in the Metropolitan Zone.l/ Out of these 400 households,&#13;
267 and 133 were from urban and rural areas, respectively. This represents&#13;
a slight oversampling of rural to urban households in relation to the percent-&#13;
ages implied by the 1970 Census for the Metropolitan Zone. Nevertheless, it&#13;
is in accordance with the national average.&#13;
4.06      An additional problem with the 1974 National Nutrition Survey&#13;
relates to the fact that meals eaten away from the house were not recorded.&#13;
Consequently, food intakes for the upper income classes was generally under-&#13;
reported. During the initial stratifications of the data, average calorie&#13;
intakes of the upper income classes was lower than that reported in the lower&#13;
income classes. Therefore, the data had to be either transformed or edited&#13;
before the relative impact of different determinants of an individual's daily&#13;
calorie intake could be estimated. Two major methods were used. One method&#13;
estimated separate equations on the calories consumed at each of three major&#13;
meals - breakfast, lunch and dinner - for those individuals where a meal was&#13;
reported. The second method deleted all those individual observations from&#13;
1/ This sampling ratio is somewhat lower than that used in similar sur-&#13;
veys in other countries--Sri Lanka (4.5/1,000), Brazil (3/1,000),&#13;
Bangladesh (6/1,000) and Indonesia (2/10, 000).&#13;

the sample that had information missing on either calorie intake at one of&#13;
the major meals, weight, height, per capita family income or family size.&#13;
This was done in order to get a "cleaner" data set which could be used to&#13;
evaluate the impact of the supplementary feeding program on net calorie&#13;
intake.&#13;
Determinants of Calorie Intake&#13;
4.07      Annex II, Table 1 gives some basic statistics by age group and&#13;
income class status for the population covered by the survey in the Metro-&#13;
politan area. Average and standard error values are also separately reported&#13;
for participants and nonparticipants to the supplementary feeding program&#13;
(Annex II, Tables 2 and 3). While on average it does appear that partici-&#13;
pants have lower incomes, particularly in rural areas, the variability within&#13;
the group is so large that the "t" test for mean differences fails at 95%&#13;
confidence level for all the characteristics considered.&#13;
4.08      Rather than by a straightforward comparison of the means, differ-&#13;
ences in feeding levels and anthropometric characteristics can be investi-&#13;
gated with a regression model. Table 4 reports the final results of the&#13;
estimate of a calorie demand function performed both on the original sample&#13;
and on a derived cross-section of grouped observations. The objectives&#13;
of the regression analysis are: first, to test and quantify the hypothesized&#13;
semilogarithmic relation between calorie consumption and household income;l/&#13;
second, to test the effect of other variables such as family size, age,&#13;
individual weight, height, nutritional status, and urban/rural location; and&#13;
third, to test and measure the effect of program participation.&#13;

4.09      In principle, all these variables may have a separate effect on&#13;
calorie consumption and such effects may vary by age group. Accordingly,&#13;
urban/rural location, program participation and age classes were represented&#13;
by dummy variables, and various equation forms including dummy variables for&#13;
all these characteristics as well as for their interaction with the scalar&#13;
variables were tested for potential significance. As Table 4 shows, the&#13;
final equation form selected contains only the interaction dummies for&#13;
participation and age, and for income, family size and weight. For all other&#13;
coefficients the usual tests failed to reject the null hypothesis at even a&#13;
90% significance level.&#13;
4.10      The table reports five separate equations.  The first four equa-&#13;
tion are from regression analysis of the original sample purged of the&#13;
observations flawed by unreported meals or zero values.  The fifth equation&#13;
is from weighted 1/ regression analysis of grouped data obtained by the sample&#13;
into 134 cells on the basis of equally numerous income classes. As comparison&#13;
with the results from the original sample readily shows, neither the size of&#13;
the coefficients nor the standard errors are significantly affected by aggre-&#13;
gation. The degree of fit to the data of the aggregate equation, on the other&#13;
hand (as measured, for example, by the R ) shows a drastic improvement as vir-&#13;
tually all the intercell variance of calorie intake is explained by the chosen&#13;
independent variables. The robustness of the coefficient estimates under&#13;
aggregation and the high explanatory power of the regression for the grouped&#13;
2&#13;
data suggest that the relatively low R oE the disaggregated equations can be&#13;
attributed to erratic individual factors.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
4.11      Given the above premises, we can now consider in more detail the&#13;
quantitative results obtained. First, the estimated equations on calories&#13;
at each of the three major meals suggest that there may be a substantial&#13;
difference between the effect of income and family size depending on when&#13;
the calories are consumed. As shown in table 4, the amount of calories&#13;
consumed at breakfast appear to be unassociated with the per capita income&#13;
level or the size of the household. In contrast, both variables have a&#13;
significant effect (positive for income and negative for family size) on&#13;
calorie intake at lunch and dinner. Because more than one-third of calorie&#13;
consumption apparently occurs at breakfast (and probably much more than one-&#13;
third for milk and because of the traditional association of this food with&#13;
the earlier meal), this implies that the overall pattern of consumption across&#13;
households is somewhat more stable than expected on the basis of the varia-&#13;
bility of the individual observations.&#13;
4.12      Second, partly as a consequence of such a pattern, the response of&#13;
calorie consumption to household income is rather low, and the overall elas-&#13;
ticity at the average consumption level is below the 10% mark, and in all the&#13;
numerous tests performed did not show any tendency to increase significantly&#13;
for program participants or for particular age groups. Third, while the&#13;
equations presented in Table 4 did measure a real difference in calorie&#13;
intake between participants and nonparticipants, such differences were&#13;
never statistically significant at reasonable levels of confidence. Never-&#13;
theless, they suggest a positive program effect for children of age below 23&#13;
months and for adults over 45 years. Because of the statistical significance&#13;
of these effects, however, we can only consider these indications as qualitative&#13;
tendencies.&#13;

4.13      Table 5 presents the results of further regression analysis per-&#13;
formed on the basis of these results. Because the difference between par-&#13;
ticipants and nonparticipants are statistically insignificant, the calorie&#13;
intake behavior of the household can be studied with an equation that takes&#13;
into account only socioeconomic and age differences over the whole "pooled"&#13;
sample of the two subpopulations (participants and nonparticipants). The&#13;
results in Table 5 refer to the three individual major meals as well as to&#13;
the sum of the calories consumed in those meals and in two additional&#13;
"snacks" of particular relevance for the very young children.   They show&#13;
that the pattern of allocation of household calories can be characterized&#13;
as having two components: (i) a hierarchical-age component and (ii) a&#13;
calorie requirement component.&#13;
4.14      In general, allocation within the three major meals follows a&#13;
hierarchical pattern with great regularity and has only a minor relation to&#13;
the calorie requirement. If we consider the allocation implied by the&#13;
"lunch" equation, for example, we see that male adult family members (over&#13;
15 years of age) receive the largest portion of the meal even after proper&#13;
account has been made of their higher body weight and activity level (as&#13;
reflected in the calorie requirement). They are followed by the female adults&#13;
and then by children (first the males and the females) of decreasing age.&#13;
4.15      When the additional snacks are taken into account, however,&#13;
the equation for total calories shows that the allocation is high egal-&#13;
itarian and, if anything, tends to be skewed in the direction of younger chil-&#13;
dren. In this equation, the bias in favor of the male members of the family&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
is no longer statistically significant, and the intrafamily allocation is&#13;
drastically tilted in favor of the children due to the high value of the&#13;
coefficient of the calorie requirement variable. Because at the very early&#13;
ages calorie requirements are relatively low, this implies that the income&#13;
at which the youngest children are likely to be malnourished is much less&#13;
than the income at which the adults will run the same risk. For example,&#13;
for a male child between 5 and 23 months of age in the urban area, the&#13;
average calorie requirement is about 1,052 calories, implying that an income&#13;
of only 2.41 pesos/month would be sufficient to provide for its needs (see&#13;
Table 6). In contrast, given a male adult requirement level of 2,578 calo-&#13;
ries, the income necessary to provide his daily requirement would be more&#13;
than 90 pesos per month in the urban area and more than 60 in the rural area.&#13;
4.16      These results are somewhat startling in that they seem to refute&#13;
the conventional assumption about the nature of groups with higher risk of&#13;
malnutrition. In effect, while the belief that females and children are&#13;
discriminated against in the main meals is upheld by the data, when all&#13;
meals eaten in the home are considered, the bias disappears and is, in part,&#13;
reversed.&#13;
Determinants of Protein Intake&#13;
4.17      Table 7 reports results of a regression analysis of determinants of&#13;
protein intake of the same type as the one performed for calories. Unlike the&#13;
calorie analysis, the main result transpiring from these equations is&#13;
major statistically significant higher protein intakes in participant children&#13;
between 5 months and 5 years of age). These increases are concentrated at break-&#13;
fast, as one might have expected, given that in Chile milk is considered a&#13;
&#13;

component of the early meal especially for children and during the two snacks&#13;
covered, in addition to the three main meals, by the "total protein" equation.&#13;
4.18      Because protein-income elasticity as measured in the total equation&#13;
appears to be significantly higher than the corresponding calorie parameter and&#13;
of a general order of magnitude of unity or more for participant children, the&#13;
effect of the program on protein intake, both through direct retention of the&#13;
leading supplement and indirect income effect, is certainly substantial.&#13;
4.19      As in the calorie case, overall nutrient allocation does not appear&#13;
to depend on sex and/or age, once differences in protein requirements are taken&#13;
into account. Urban households seem to be much worse off, ceteris paribus,&#13;
than rural household in protein consumption. A slight positive bias in favor&#13;
of male adults between 19 and 30 years of age in the participant group seems&#13;
to exist in the allocation of proteins at lunch, but the difference all but&#13;
disappears once the other meals are taken into account.&#13;
Calorie/Protein Impact&#13;
4.20      Given the above results, the impaci: of the program on intended and&#13;
unintended beneficiaries can be quantified in two successive steps. First,&#13;
the net increase in calorie and protein intalke that results from the: increase&#13;
in purchasing power of the household due to the program can be derived by&#13;
evaluating the supplement at current market prices and treating it as an&#13;
income transfer. Second, the additional effect of supplementary feeding on&#13;
the intake of the direct beneficiaries can be directly estimated by comparing&#13;
the coefficients of the corresponding dummy variables in the regressions&#13;
reported in Tables 4 and 7.&#13;

4.21      Table 8 presents estimates of the net increase due to supp:Lementation&#13;
based on this method. The amount of milk distributed to mothers and preschool&#13;
children is valued at the average retail price of milk in 1974 (0.14 pesos/&#13;
liter). As shown in the table, depending on the average income of the family&#13;
and for the reference case of 2.6 direct beneficiaries (one pregnant mother&#13;
with two eligible children), this is equivallent to an income transfer between&#13;
2.1% and 15.2% of the household income. The change in calorie and protein&#13;
intake that results from such an income transfer is predicted using the&#13;
estimated relationships between nutrient intake and income.&#13;
4.22       The net increase in nutrient intake that results from supplementation&#13;
for the average household member is shown in the first two columns marked NC&#13;
and NP on Table 8. For calories the average increase in household availability&#13;
is very small it reaches at the most about 2% of the recommended dietary&#13;
allowance (the "calorie" requirement). Because of the much higher income&#13;
elasticity of protein demand, on the other hand, the protein increases are&#13;
sizable and range between 1% and 8% of the recommended daily allowELnce of an&#13;
adult male.&#13;
4.23      The leakages created by the program to consumption items other than&#13;
the food supplement can be quantified by dividing the estimated nutrient&#13;
increases by the average amount of food received by the household through&#13;
the program. The percentages of the nutrient supplement obtained by the&#13;
average household members are shown in the columns PNC and PNP. As one would&#13;
expect, given the nature of the supplement, the percentages retair,ed for&#13;
proteins are much higher than the ones for calories. Because of the method&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
adopted, in fact, the average percentage increase in protein intake is&#13;
approximately 1.6 times the average percentage increase in calories.l/&#13;
4.24      Table 8 shows also the absolute and relative increases in&#13;
nutrient intakes of the direct beneficiaries: i.e. the children of less than&#13;
23 months of age for which regression analysis registers an increase over and&#13;
above the one induced by the pure income transfer. For this population group&#13;
the effect of the program appears to be substantial both in terms of calories&#13;
and proteins. Because of the importance that nutrient deficits could have for&#13;
the health status of children of this age group, therefore, the results&#13;
suggest a major impact of the program. Furthermore, despite the fact that&#13;
the supplement is much higher in protein than in calorie content relative to&#13;
the daily allowance, the percentage of calories retained appears to be higher&#13;
than the proteins. In part, this could depend on the fact that the age specific&#13;
calorie increase is affected by a relatively large standard error (see Table 4).&#13;
The result, however, also suggests that, while the milk supplement is shared&#13;
among all family members, smaller children are allowed to consume a larger&#13;
share of milk and are compensated by an additional allocation of other food.&#13;
Major Factors Affecting Individual&#13;
Height and Weight&#13;

only weight and height are readily usable for statistical analysis. In&#13;
spite of the potential interest for other, more subtle indicators of nutritional&#13;

status, these two basic measurements can be used, as for calorie intakes (i)&#13;
to test the program impact on the population as a whole and on the children in&#13;
particular and (ii) to assess the importance of socioeconomic variables in&#13;
determining the pattern of physical growth of the same population.&#13;
4.26      As for the calorie and protein equations, separate statistical tests&#13;
were conducted to determine whether the parameters of response of weight and&#13;
height to the socioeconomic variables were (i) significantly different for the&#13;
different age groups and (ii) significantly different, for each age group for&#13;
participants and nonparticipants. By and large, in both cases the results of&#13;
the tests were negative for the latter question and positive for the former&#13;
only to the extent that weight and height differences were reflected in&#13;
different average values for each age group. In no case did we find evidence&#13;
of interaction between the response of the same variables with the socioeconomic&#13;
characteristics and age.&#13;
4.27      Table 9 presents a first set of results for children under five&#13;
years of age. Both in terms of weight and height, the two equations estimated&#13;
show no significant difference between participants and nonparticipants at any&#13;
age. Furthermore, only sex and urban/rural location, besides the age variables,&#13;
appear to have a significant effect on the two measurements. Genetic variables&#13;
such as the corresponding measurements of the parents also appeared to have no&#13;
effect from earlier tests. Table 10 presents a second set of results for&#13;
members of the population below 19 years of age. For this group of indivi-&#13;
duals, on which we have sample information on parents' measurements, the&#13;
analysis shows again no significant program impact except in the case of&#13;

weights for the 15-19 age group. Income is again highly significant and&#13;
appears to have a sizable effect: on average a one peso percent increase in&#13;
income is associated with a coeteris paribus increase of 2.3 kg of weight and&#13;
3.5 cm of height. Family size appears to have a negative impact on both&#13;
measurements, while both father's and mother's measurements show a strong and&#13;
significant positive effect, as expected. Urban residence and sex appear to&#13;
have a significant influence only on height.&#13;
4.28      The same results are confirmed by Table 11, where the whole sample&#13;
of participants and nonparticipants is analyzed with the same technique.&#13;
These equations show a lower, though still significant, role of the socio-&#13;
economic variables in explaining differences in weight and height. Both by&#13;
comparison with equations in Table 10 and by directly observing the&#13;
coefficients of the age dummies, it is also clear that an inter-generational&#13;
increase in stature is taking place: the 15-19 years old appear to be taller&#13;
(but not heavier) than the adults in the following three classes. As in the&#13;
case of the regression for the children, urban population members, males and&#13;
smaller families appear to have a definite advantage (though with significance&#13;
in variables (weight and height).&#13;
4.29      While for almost all age groups the tests conducted lead us to re-&#13;
ject the hypothesis that program participation has any direct effect (as&#13;
opposed to indirect income effect) on weight and height, the equations in&#13;
Table 10 reveals one significant exception. For both sets of measurements,&#13;
the young adults between 15 and 30 years of age in the participants group&#13;
show a rather large and significant difference from the corresponding group&#13;

in the nonparticipants subpopulation. Given the large sample used for the&#13;
analysis, it is difficult to dismiss such a diiference as being due to random&#13;
factors. Since the milk distribution program, in a form approximate to the&#13;
present one, was started in the early 1950s, one may speculate that the full&#13;
effect of the program perhaps can only be fully seen in the age group between&#13;
14 and 30. This group, comprising adolescents and young adults, is also the&#13;
one that would reveal any long-term growth effects of an improvement Ln the&#13;
calorie-protein balance.&#13;
4.30      The result described above is, of course, highly speculative, but it&#13;
is consistent with the results of the calorie and protein consumption analysis.&#13;
In fact, both the income effect and the direct impact on younger children as&#13;
measured by the nutrient consumption equations would presumably beconme capital-&#13;
ized in the longer run into higher weights and heights of adolescentEl and&#13;
adults. Even small improvements in the calorie-protein balance, therefore,&#13;
can have a very substantial impact on long-run vital characteristics of the&#13;
population. This aspect of the analysis of program impact is further elaborated&#13;
on in Annex I.&#13;

Chapter V: CONCLUSIONS&#13;
5.01      The results presented in this paper are partial and tentative.&#13;
The sample of observations considered covers only the metropolitan area&#13;
of Santiago: an important part, but still only half of the total population&#13;
of Chile. The same sample is based on a survey conducted for a particular&#13;
year, so that any conclusion as to the relationship of the results for&#13;
that year to the previous and following years is necessarily speculative.&#13;
Many observations, particularly on individual family meals, are missing and,&#13;
while there is no evidence of a bias, our information is not sufficient to&#13;
exclude some systematicism in the missing observations. Finally, the nature&#13;
of the statistical evidence revealed is more negative than positive and is&#13;
limited to a very specific set of tests and a handful of estimated parameters.&#13;
5.02      Nevertheless, after having taken into account and underlined these&#13;
inherent weaknesses of our data, data treatment and results, there remain&#13;
a number of interesting and in part startling conclusions which are worth&#13;
summarizing and briefly illustrating here. First, a popular functional&#13;
form of a demand equation for nutrients appears to explain well the inter-&#13;
individual differences in calorie and protein consumption. (But the statistical&#13;
tests conducted are unable to reject the hypothesis that program participation&#13;
has an effect on household calorie consumption equivalent to a cash transfer&#13;
or increase in real income, on all family members except the smaller children&#13;
(5-23 months old). Estimates of this equation reveal a measurable though&#13;
statistically significant at rather low levels of confidence, increase in&#13;
calorie consumption and a highly significant increase in protein consumption by&#13;
children (5-23 months) in the participant group. These increases are over&#13;
and above the ones that can be predicted on the basis of socioeconomic and&#13;
growth differences.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5.03      Second, the data support the popular presumption that males adults of&#13;
working age have the lion's share of "formal." family meals (breakfast, lunch&#13;
and dinner) and that female members and/or children of younger age are com-&#13;
paratively at disadvantage in these major meals. However, when account is&#13;
taken of snacks and other sources of nutrients, the distribution of nutrients&#13;
among household members appear to follow quite strictly their need as&#13;
expressed by FAO/WHO requirement and no significant sex or age bias;es emerges.&#13;
Moreover, such an egalitarian distribution of basic food among the members of&#13;
the household tends to reinforce the result obtained on program participation&#13;
effect.&#13;
5.04      Third, the analysis of weight and height measurements of the&#13;
individuals belonging to the two population groups supports the hypothesis&#13;
that these two vital statistics are determined by (i) genetic factors, (ii)&#13;
family income, and (iii) other socioeconomic variables. The same analysis&#13;
also suggests that a long-term effect of program participation may have taken&#13;
place as shown in a significant difference in weight and height measurements&#13;
of population members in a critical age group (14-30 years). This age group&#13;
is critical from the point of view of the individual growth curve, i.e.,&#13;
substantial increases in dietary intakes t:hroughout infancy and early&#13;
adolescence are likely to show their impact during the puberty/young&#13;
adulthood period.&#13;

MEASURING THE IMPACT OF A SUPPLEMENTARY FOOD PROGRAM&#13;
THROUGH A QUANTITATIVE MODEL&#13;
1.        The impact of a supplementary food program would ideally be&#13;
studied by an experiment appropriately designed to control all socioeconomic&#13;
and genetic factors that might cause differences in food intakes and vital&#13;
statistics between participants and nonparticipants. In practice, even&#13;
if experiments can be designed to measure specific, short-term effects of&#13;
the program, it would be impossible to design and carry out a plan of measure-&#13;
ments over a long period of time and simultaneously maintain some of the&#13;
basic features of experimental design such as, for example, the random&#13;
assignment of subjects to the two groups to be compared.&#13;
2.        Rather than by an experiment, program impact can be measured by&#13;
taking proper account of the individual variables that would be controlled&#13;
through careful experimental design. This can be accomplished through the&#13;
use of a quantitative model, where the effects of variables other than&#13;
program participation are estimated and accounted for separately. While&#13;
models of various sophistication can be used, their ultimate objective with&#13;
regard to program impact measurement is simply to separate the source of&#13;
variation due to program participation from the one due to outside factors.&#13;
Once the program effect is isolated from the one of other potentially con-&#13;
fusing variables, questions can be asked not only as to the statistical&#13;
significance of the effects generated by the program, but also as to the&#13;
estimate of their direct and indirect impacts on the target population.&#13;
3.        A simple model to investigate program participation effects can&#13;
be formulated by defining the following set of variables:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
Dit= dietary level (as measured for example by calorie/protein&#13;
intake) at time t of a population member of age i,&#13;
Sit= socioeconomic status (a measured by income, urban-rural&#13;
location, etc.),&#13;
Git= growth status (as measured by height and weight, for&#13;
example),&#13;
Pit= degree of program participat:Lon,&#13;
Eit= genetic factors.&#13;
Among these variables, D itand Git are interdependent, endogneous variables,&#13;
while Si  and Ei   are exogenous.  In algebraic terms, this implies the fol-&#13;
lowing simple simultaneous two-equation model:&#13;
it    i( it,    it'  it)                                     (I.1)&#13;
it   9i     it  it  it-i'  it&#13;
where fi and gi indicate specific functional relationships for the ith indi-&#13;
vidual. Note that the "real" number of equations will be determined by the&#13;
number of variables measuring dietary status and growth.&#13;
4.        The impact of a supplementary food program in the context of (I.1)&#13;
and (I.2) can be seen as either a shift of the socioeconomic indicators&#13;
symbolized by the Sit variable (e.g., an increase in the real income of the&#13;
household) or by a modification of the furnctional relationships linking&#13;
dietary and growth levels to the other model variables. Formally, this can&#13;
be described by taking the total derivative of Dit and Git with respect to&#13;
program participation degree P i.   In the specified form of (I.1) and I.2),&#13;
this implies that the effect of program participation can be measured simulta-&#13;
neously for the demand and growth variable.   For Dit in particular, we have:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
dDit  =    fi  dGit  +   fi    it  +     i               (I.3)&#13;
dP        G     dP       S    dP        P&#13;
it       it     it      it    it       it&#13;
Where we have decomposed the effect of program participation on diet into&#13;
three components:   (i) a growth component, (ii) a socioeconomic component,&#13;
and (iii) a specific program component.&#13;
5.        For the growth equation, on the other hand, we have:&#13;
dGit 5    gi     it  +    i                              (1.4)&#13;
dP        S    dP        P&#13;
it       it    it       it&#13;
There is no relationship through D     1  since it is not possible to improve&#13;
yesterday's diet by increasing program participation today.&#13;
6.         If we define the program participation as a 1-0 variable (partici-&#13;
pants and nonparticipants), equations (I.1)-(I.4) can be interpreted as&#13;
referring to two mutually exclusive groups of observations. In this case,&#13;
the derivatives in (I.3) and (I.4) can only be interpreted by analogy since&#13;
the effect of Pit on the different variables is discontinuous. Even within&#13;
such analytic framework, however, we can still decompose the effect of&#13;
program participation in the three abovementioned components and analyze our&#13;
data sample, maintaining this distinction. For the one shot, cross-section&#13;
survey considered in the main text, for example, equations (I.1) and (I.2) are&#13;
specified as follows:&#13;
D   =  a     +  bijGij +  c ijSij +  mi Ei               (1.5)&#13;
ij     ij      -ij) ijij           ij&#13;
&#13;

            Food distribution and nutrition
            intervention; the case of Chile
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The paper analyzes the impact of
            Chile's Complementary Feeding Program (CFP), both on
            the direct and indirect beneficiaries. The paper describes
            Chile's major nutrition intervention programs and
            establishes the relative importance of the CFP in terms of
            budgetary expenditures and number of beneficiaries reached.
            It briefly reviews the program's past limitations,
            recent reforms and potential effectiveness. Finally, using
            data from the 1974-75 National Nutrition Survey, it examines
            whether participation by beneficiaries in the program was
            responsible for any significant difference in various
            indicators of nutritional wellbeing, once factors such as
            income, urban/rural location, sex and age are taken into
            account. The major purpose of this paper is to provide
            quantitative estimates of the impact of Chile's
            Complementary Feeding Program.
