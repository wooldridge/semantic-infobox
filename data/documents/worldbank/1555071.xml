INCENTIVES FOR RESOURCE ALLOCATION:&#13;
A CASE STUDY OF SUDAN&#13;
The paper examines the role of a wide range of policy interven-&#13;
tions -- such as taxes and subsidies on international transactions, exchange&#13;
rates, import licensing/foreign exchange allocation, export licensing and&#13;
marketing schemes, domestic excise taxes and price controls -- in determining&#13;
the overall incentive framework influencing the allocation of resources in&#13;
Sudan in the mid-1970s. The paper addresses questions such as:&#13;
-Do policies encourage appropriate choice of economic&#13;
activities within the major productive sectors of&#13;
agriculture and industry?&#13;
-    Does the policy framework entail any overall incen-&#13;
tive bias in favor of agriculture or industry?&#13;
-    Does the structure of incentives imply any pronounced&#13;
bias in favor of import-substitution activities or&#13;
exports?&#13;
On the basis of detailed analysis the paper concludes that the&#13;
incentive framework confers widely divergent rates of effective protection&#13;
to different industrial and agricultural activities; that overall the&#13;
incentive framework is biased against agriculture and in favor of industry;&#13;
and that it is biased in favor of import substitution and against exports.&#13;
The paper concludes with a set of policy suggestions for reforming the&#13;
incentive framework to be more in line with the underlying comparative&#13;
advantage of the Sudanese economy.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION*&#13;
A. Definition and Scope&#13;
1.        "Resource allocation" connotes many things to many men.    Inclusion&#13;
of the phrase in a title demands instant elaboration. In this paper we&#13;
attempt to describe and evaluate the policy framework which guides the allo-&#13;
cation of land, labor and capital between competing activities in Sudan. But&#13;
even this statement is too general. It reveals nothing of:&#13;
(a) objectives in terms of which allocation policy may be&#13;
evaluated;&#13;
(b) the demarcation between those "influences" which may be&#13;
appropriately studied as policy instruments and those that&#13;
must be taken as "institutional givens";&#13;
(c) the further delineation of those policies which most directly&#13;
affect the incentive framework;&#13;
(d) the distinction between static and dynamic allocation&#13;
considerations; and&#13;
(e) the diversity of economic organization and the varying&#13;
relevance of incentives for resource allocation.&#13;
A word on each of these will help define the scope of this paper.&#13;
*    This paper was prepared in connection with the International Labor&#13;
Office's Comprehensive Employment Strategy Mission to Sudan in February/&#13;
March 1975. A condensed version appears as Technical Paper No. 17 in&#13;
the Mission's Report, Growth, Employment and Equity: The Case of Sudan,&#13;
published by ILO in 1976. While some of the factual material and pol-&#13;
icy suggestions presented here have been overtaken by events and policy&#13;
changes since 1975, the analysis retains interest as a case study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
2.        We shall take it as axiomatic tiat the r -nc.pi obje tives wTh&#13;
must underlie any evaluation of resource allocation pvrliies are econiomic&#13;
efficiency (growth in a dynamic context) -ad equity (mainly inter-personal&#13;
and inter-regional).    n the whole the evaluation of the p.licy frame in&#13;
this paper will be in terms of efficie.acy criteria.   To rephrase in ecoiearic&#13;
jargon, we shall try to diagnos.! conspicuous, policy-indu,ed departures from&#13;
the economy's potential production frontier. Tlhis is cerLai-ly not because&#13;
we consider equity objectives to be secondary. Rather, it is our belief&#13;
that the most powerful instruments for effecting equity goals in Sudan lie&#13;
within the domain of public expenditure policy (especially in the rural&#13;
sector), a domain, which, as we make clear below, is outside the scope of&#13;
this paper. And that therefore it makes good sense to rest the evaluation&#13;
of incentive policies essentially on efficiency criteria. However, we shall&#13;
be careful to avoid Pavlovian criticisms of equity-informed departures from&#13;
efficiency policy norms. Indeed, where we feel that specific incentive&#13;
policies constitute efficient (least-cost) vehicles for equity goals, we&#13;
shall say so.&#13;
3.        Any discussion of public policy requires implicit or explicit&#13;
distinctions between those government modalities and actions which form&#13;
elements of policy and those which are more appropriately categorized as&#13;
institutional substructure, givens in the analysis. ThEe more radical the&#13;
analysis the smaller is the bedrock of institutional givens.     Like all line-&#13;
drawing exercises, mucli hinges on judgment.   On this point we shall tend&#13;
to be conservative, because we believe that the acceptability of our analysis&#13;
and recommendations will be greater the less the accompanying dosage of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
institutional restructuring. To illustrate: in the present Gezira.scheme&#13;
the Board decrees tne cropping pattern for every year. We shall take this&#13;
fact as a given, thus precluding exploration of alternative institutional&#13;
arrangements for determining cropping pattern (e.g. leaving the choice&#13;
completely up to tenant farmers). However, we shall evaluate as policy&#13;
the specific cropping pattern choices decreed by the Board and the analy-&#13;
tical bases for these decisions.&#13;
4.        Public policies with respect to resource allocation can be con-&#13;
veniently partitioned into three types:&#13;
(a) Direct public participation in productive activity, with the&#13;
state as entrepreneur;&#13;
(b) Public expenditure on infrastructure and services to support&#13;
and induce complementary private productive activity;&#13;
(c) Public "indirect" 1/ intervention through the foreign trade!&#13;
exchange, fiscal, monetary and price regimes which together&#13;
engender the incentive frame guiding resource allocation by&#13;
private and quasi-private agents.&#13;
Within this rough typology it is the last category which we refer to by the&#13;
shorthand rubric of "incentive policies", and which is the concern of this&#13;
paper.&#13;
5.        The frequent characterization of Sudan as an economy in which the&#13;
public sector looms large in production may suggest that the domain over which&#13;
1/   This is a broad use of the term "indirect" which encompasses interven-&#13;
tions through the price mechanism (taxes, subsidies) as well as admin-&#13;
istrative controls like auantitative trade restrictions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
the incentive structure prevailing in product and factor markets has an impor-&#13;
tant influence is small. We take issue with this suggestion. We believe&#13;
there is a real danger of painting an excessively command economy picture&#13;
of Sudan. fhe conventional characterization rests heavily on grouping the&#13;
production within the large agricultural parastatals with the public sector.&#13;
While this is in some senses appropriate, it is important to realize that:&#13;
(a) within the parastatals many of the decisions for&#13;
allocating labor, land and minor on-farm investments&#13;
are taken by private agents, the tenants;&#13;
(b) even where the public managing board decrees the crop&#13;
rotation pattern, the choice of crops to include in&#13;
the rotation is, in the medium term, sensitive to their&#13;
relative prices;&#13;
(c) extrapolating recent trends, one can reasonably expect&#13;
an increasing proportion of the marketed agricultural&#13;
surplus to originate from rain-fed areas, and less&#13;
from Gezira-type schemes, where the proportion of&#13;
private allocative decision making is smaller.&#13;
As for the industrial sector, the state-owned Industrial Production Corporation&#13;
has returned to private hands some of the companies nationalized in 1970. At&#13;
present over 60% of industrial value added is estimated to originate in the&#13;
private sector. And current prospects suggest that this share will increase&#13;
with time. In any case, the public sector units are subject to much the same&#13;
industrial policy regime as private units with regard to market-information-&#13;
based appraisals, licensing procedures, foreign exchange allocation, protec-&#13;
tion and fiscal incentives; and within this policy framework the IPC units are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
expected to behave in an as-if-private manner. For all these reasons we think&#13;
it would be difficult to overestimate the resource allocative role of the&#13;
incentive structure embedded in the trade, fiscal, monetary and price regimes.&#13;
6.        Clearly, the incentive framework informs both static and dynamic&#13;
allocation decisions. Both fall within our purview, but the relative emphasis&#13;
will change with sectors. For example, within the manufacturing sector,&#13;
where present factor allocations are mostly a reflection of past investment&#13;
decisions, it is more important to consider the implications of the incentive&#13;
structure for future factor allocations. In contrast, in agriculture, land&#13;
allocation between alternative activities is much more readily reversible,&#13;
pointing up the importance of the incentive framework for current allocation&#13;
decisions as well.&#13;
B. Policy Components of the Incentive Framework&#13;
7.        What we connote by the "incentive framework" will perhaps become&#13;
clearer if we catalog the main policy components of this structure. They are:&#13;
(1) Explicit taxes/subsidies on international transactions;&#13;
(2)  Exchange rate policy;&#13;
(3) Import licensing/foreign exchange allocation;&#13;
(4) Export licensing/export marketing systems;&#13;
(5) Explicit non-trade taxes and subsidites;&#13;
(6) Domestic price control policies;&#13;
(7) Domestic project licensing policies;&#13;
(8) Pricing/administrative allocation of publicly&#13;
provided infrastructural services;&#13;
(9) Domestic credit and interest rate policies; and&#13;
(10) Wage policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
All of these policy interventions interact with existing product and factor&#13;
markets to create the structure of incentives guiding resource allocation in&#13;
the Sudanese economy.&#13;
8.        This paper will be limited to the incentive effects of the first&#13;
eight categories of policy intervention, all of which impinge most immediately&#13;
on product markets. The last two work directly through factor markets (some&#13;
elemaents of the interventions relating to the foreign trade/payments regime&#13;
also have important direct effects on the price of capital services).&#13;
C. Main Questions Addressed&#13;
9.        The paper will be shaped by attempts to answer (however crudely)&#13;
the following key questions with regard to resource allocation incentives:&#13;
(a) Do existing policies encourage economically efficient&#13;
choice of activities within the major productive sectors,&#13;
agriculture, and industry?&#13;
(b) Does the current policy framework harbor any overall&#13;
incentive bias in favor of agriculture or industry?&#13;
(c) Does the present structure of incentives imply any&#13;
pronounced bias in favor of import substitution or&#13;
exports?&#13;
(d) Are the government's direct controls on prices and&#13;
quantity allocations efficient instruments for attain-&#13;
ing stated objectives?&#13;
(e) What key policy reforms need to be undertaken to&#13;
facilitate a development strategy based on promoting&#13;
agricultural exports?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10.       We need hardly stress that the scarcity of data, past research&#13;
and time will permit only a superficial analysis of these questions, but&#13;
they are of such importance that we consider even this to be better than&#13;
pure agnosticism.&#13;
11.       Section II gives a synoptic description of those policy components&#13;
whose workings cut across sectors, particularly elements of the foreign&#13;
trade/payments regime. Details of these and other policy intervention modes&#13;
are more usefully tackled within the intra-sector analyses, which follow.&#13;
Section III evaluates the incentive structure within the Agriculture sector;&#13;
Section IV deals with Industry. Section V exa,nines whether there is any&#13;
broad inter-sectoral bias, and Section VI considers the issue of exports vs.&#13;
import-substitution bias. Section VII notes some of the lessons to be drawn&#13;
from the Sudanese experience with administrative interventions. In Section&#13;
VIII an attempt is made to outline the key policy reforms necessary to make&#13;
the incentive structure consonant with a development strategy based on agri-&#13;
cultural-exports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. Elements of the Policy Framework&#13;
i2.       We confine this section to a summary description of those components&#13;
of the policy framework whose influence, at least in theory, pervades the&#13;
entire economy. The economic effects of these policies, as well as more&#13;
details on their operation, are considered in later sections.&#13;
A. The Foreign Trade/Payments Regime&#13;
13.       The main elements of the foreign trade/payments regime are:&#13;
(a) The exchange tax/subsidy scheme&#13;
(b) Import duties and surcharges&#13;
(c) Foreign exchange budgeting/exchange control&#13;
(d) Import licensing&#13;
(e) Export duties and surcharges&#13;
(f) Export licensing/export marketing&#13;
(g) Policies for invisibles.&#13;
The Exchange Tax/Subsidy Scheme&#13;
14.       The official exchange parity of the Sudanese pound with respect&#13;
to the U.S. dollar has remained unchanged over the decade 1965 to 1975 at&#13;
ES1 = US$2.87. Biqt since March 1972 the Bank of Sudan has operated at a 15%&#13;
exchange tax/subsidy scheme on all transactions except exports of cotton&#13;
and gum arabic, which amounts to a de facto 15% devaluation to a rate of&#13;
hSl = US$2.50 coupled with 15% export taxes on cotton and gum arabic 1/.&#13;
Unlike other foreign trade taxes which are administered by the Customs&#13;
Department, this scheme is controlled by the Bank of Sudan, which transfers&#13;
1/   It is important to note that all balance of payments figures reflect&#13;
conversions at the official parity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the net receipts to the Ministry of Finance.    In his June 1974 budget speech&#13;
the Finance Minister mooted the possibility of "withdrawing all or part of&#13;
this incentive, in the case of goods that have proved in high demand inter-&#13;
nationally and that are able to compete...". But up until the end of the&#13;
year systematic withdrawal of the export subsidy on commodities besides&#13;
cotton and gum arabic had not been undertaken 1/. However, in December 1974&#13;
the export duty on meat and meat products was raised from 5% to 20%, which is&#13;
equivalent to withholding the 15% subsidy.&#13;
Import Duties&#13;
15.       The Sudanese Customs Tariff contains specific duty rates for nearly&#13;
1100 items, mostly on an ad valorem basis. There are 26 different rates of&#13;
duty ranging from 5% to 600%. However, eight rates of duty together account&#13;
for about 90% of the items (Table 1).&#13;

As with most tariff structures, the highest rates of duty are on consumer goods&#13;
(except cereals), while capital and intermediate products are taxed at lower&#13;
rates (see Table 2). In addition to these duty rates there have been, from&#13;
time to time, uniform import surcharges.&#13;
16.       The collections from these import taxes have averaged 40% of c.i.f.&#13;
import value between 1970/71 and 1973/74, though there was a steady decline&#13;
from the 1970/71 figure of 46% to 34% in 1973/74. The decline is explained&#13;
partly by the reduction in the 1972 import surcharge, partly by the increasing&#13;
importance of import duty rebates under fiscal concessions, and partly by&#13;
recent changes in import composition in favor of low-duty foodstuffs.&#13;
17.       Furthermore, one should note that Sudan also levies consumption&#13;
duties on five items (beer, cigarettes, motor spirits, lubricant oil and&#13;
matches), which, because they impinge solely on imports of these commodities,&#13;
can be analyzed as commodity-specific import surcharges. The high rates&#13;
levied on these items lead to duty collections amounting to 5 or 6% of total&#13;
c.i.f. import value.&#13;
18.       Finally, since June 1974, a 2% Development Tax has been instituted,&#13;
which is collected on imports, exports and domestic production. The import-&#13;
related element acts as an additional, uniform import surcharge 1/.&#13;
Foreign Exchange Budgeting/Exchange Control&#13;
19.       Foreign exchange is allocated according to an indicative budget&#13;
prepared every year by the Foreign Exchange Budget Committee. The Committee&#13;
is chaired by the Foreign Trade wing of the Ministry of Finance and National&#13;
Economy (henceforth MinFin), and includes members from the Budget section,&#13;

Cits oms Department, Bank of Sudan, Planning Commiss-ioii ;lid Ministry of&#13;
Industry.  The Committee advises the Finance Minister who has final authority&#13;
on foreign exchange allocations and import licensing.&#13;
20.       Between March and June the foreign exchange budget is prepared&#13;
for each fiscal year.   Export proceeds, invisible and capital inflows are&#13;
estimated. Debt service and other estimated invisible items are netted out,&#13;
leaving the rest for allocation to commodity imports. Government import&#13;
requirements are first estimated, the major items being imports against&#13;
the Development Budget (including the major public entities like Sudan&#13;
Railways, Central Electricity and Water Authority (CEWA) and the agricultural&#13;
parastatals), imports of wheat and sugar which enter solely on government&#13;
account, and intermediate import requirements of the public entities. Private&#13;
sector (including the Industrial Production Corporation (IPC)) commodity import&#13;
estimates are subdivided between petroleum, oil and lubricant products and&#13;
"Other". Within this large, residual category of "Other" is included an&#13;
estimated allocation for intermediate and capital good imports for domestic&#13;
manufacturing industry; while the Committee jointly agrees on this sum,&#13;
its detailed allocation across production units is largely in the hands of&#13;
the Ministry of Industry. All commodity imports have to be licensed at some&#13;
stage by M4inFin's Foreign Trade wing, but it is only with regard to private&#13;
imports (other than for domestic manufacturing) that this department wields&#13;
substantive allocative authority (see below).&#13;
21.       Once the Foreign Exchange P,,lu,ii, is approved, the Committee continues&#13;
to meet every month to adjust the broad allocations in the light of short-term&#13;
unanticipated changes in circumstances. The licensing authorities use the&#13;
budget as their main guide. Befnre any expenditures can occur, all licenses&#13;
have to be franked by the exchange control authorities in the Bank of Sudan,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
who also administer the non-commodity elements of the exchange control system.&#13;
The Bank of Sudan thus serves as a second administrative monitor on foreign&#13;
exchange allocation for imports; it can question the consonance of individual&#13;
issued licenses with the jointly agreed foreign exchange budget, though it&#13;
cannot unilaterally ceject them.&#13;
Import Licensing&#13;
22.       In addition to the Bank of Sudan and the Import Licensing Section&#13;
in the Foreign Trade wing of MinFin, several other public agencies are&#13;
intimately associated with the licensing process, depending on the commodity&#13;
and final importer involved.&#13;
23.       Effective approval of import requests by government and public&#13;
entities is chiefly exercised by the Purchasing Section of MinFin. Two impor-&#13;
tant commodity exceptions are wheat and sugar, both of which are imported&#13;
solely on government account. The staff work on wheat import requirements is&#13;
conducted by the supply wing of MinFin, with the Minister being involved in&#13;
the final approval. On sugar, the recently created Sugar Corporation is the&#13;
main approving authority. In addition, minot import requests by the Sudan&#13;
Gezira Board, Sudan Railways and C.E.W.A. up to specified value limits do&#13;
not have to be channeled through the Purchasing Section, but can be directly&#13;
processed by the Import Licensing Section in the Foreign Trade wing.    For all&#13;
other government imports, the Purchasing Section is the effective rationing&#13;
aiti7hority, with the Import Licensing Section in the Foreign Trade wing pro-&#13;
viding subsequent pro forma approval.&#13;
24.       The Import Licensing Section plays a similarly pro forma role with&#13;
respect to import requests for domestic manufacturing industry. Within the&#13;
foreign exchange budget allocation for domestic manufacturing industry, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
detailed inter-unit allocation is done by the Ministry of Industry. The&#13;
Ministry approves annual foreign exchange allocations for each plant for&#13;
machinery, spare parts and raw materials. On that basis the Import Licensing&#13;
Section issues Open General Licenses (OGLs) with one year validity, to the&#13;
manufacturing firms for specified amounts by broad commodity categories.&#13;
25.       For all other private sector imports the Import Licensing Section&#13;
performs the substantive allocative function. Consonant with the overall&#13;
magnitudes in the foreign exchange budget, this unit prepares annual private&#13;
sector import budgets with fairly detailed commodity breakdowns. 1/ For each&#13;
commodity category, the budgets are based on estimates of domestic demand&#13;
(relying on past trends and special needs), expected domestic supply and&#13;
anticipated foreign prices. These budgets provide the detailed norms which&#13;
inform private import licensing. Commodities fall into three broad categories&#13;
with regard to licensing procedure.&#13;
(a) Open General License (OGL): Commodities such as spare&#13;
parts, medical and pharmaceutical products and jute&#13;
sacks are licensed under OGL, the distinguishing fea-&#13;
tures being that these goods can be imported by all&#13;
importers and that the limits arising from the annual&#13;
budgets are loosely applied for them. 2/&#13;
(b) Annual Quota System: This extends to a range of&#13;
important items (such as -agricultural machinery,&#13;
tyres and tubes, textiles, glassware, batteries,&#13;
1/   These disaggregated budgets include commodity requirements for domestic&#13;
manufacturing as estimated by the Ministry of Industry.&#13;
2/   As noted earlier, once approved by the Ministry of Industry, imports&#13;
for domestic manufacturing also enter under OGL.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
light fittings, stationery, canned food, and other&#13;
"basic" consumer items) for which the authorities&#13;
believe previous import experience and a certain&#13;
degree of specialization is important. Consequently&#13;
the bulk of the annual budget for these commodities&#13;
is allocated to established importers, the distribu-&#13;
tion being governed by the past shares of individual&#13;
traders in the import of the specified commodity&#13;
as well as some evaluation of the "quality" of the&#13;
importer (Class I, Class II, etc.). The rest of the&#13;
annual quota for each commodity is allocated to "new"&#13;
importers to "encourage competition." 1/&#13;
(c)  Other Commodities:   A residual category of commodities&#13;
(usually accounting for less than a quarter of all&#13;
private imports) are licensed periodically over the&#13;
year, depending on applications, evaluation of need&#13;
and availability of foreign exchange. Tea and&#13;
coffee, though imported under private monopoly con-&#13;
cessions, fall into this category. So do most com-&#13;
mercial vehicles, though for them there is a special&#13;
twist: because they are usually imported under 3 to&#13;
5 year supplier-credit arrangements their impact on&#13;
foreign exchange availability is attenuated over time;&#13;
/   Though the quota is estimated for the year, the licenses issued for this&#13;
and the next category have 3-month validity, with possibilities for&#13;
renewal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
so the authorities are relatively free in permitting&#13;
these imports (and the licenses are not issued on a&#13;
cash basis).&#13;
26.       In general, the last two categories of private imports tend to bear&#13;
the brunt of unanticipated shortfalls in foreign exchange availability, while&#13;
government and OGL imports are more protected.&#13;
27.       Since 1972 a new category of imports has risen in prominence:    Nil&#13;
Value Licensed Imports. The system was initiated in April 1972. As the name&#13;
suggests, imports under these licenses place "nil" draft on domestic foreign&#13;
exchange availability; they are supposed to be financed by foreign exchange&#13;
holdings of Sudanese residents abroad. The original purpose of the system&#13;
was to encourage repatriation, in the form of commodity imports, of foreign&#13;
exchange resources held abroad by residents. Recent evaluations have pointed&#13;
to abuses which have cast doubt on the future of this system; it has been&#13;
temporarily suspended to await an in-depth review. During its operation,&#13;
specified categories of goods could be imported after licenses had been&#13;
issued by the Import Licensing Section and franked by the Bank of Sudan.&#13;
Initially the commodity specification was liberal, leading, predictably, to&#13;
heavy imports of consumer luxuries like automobiles and textiles. Subse-&#13;
quently the specification was tightened in the direction of "more essential"&#13;
products like spare parts (see Section V for an evaluation).&#13;
Export Duties and Surcharges&#13;
28.       Export duties have been levied at rates up to 15 percent on most&#13;
traditional Sudanese exports. The duties on cotton are specific; in recent&#13;
years they have amounted to 8-9 percent of export value. In addition to&#13;
duties there are specific export royalties on one commodity: gum arabic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
In June 1974 minimum duties on exports were raised to 5%, and previously&#13;
untaxed commodities were brought into the net. At the same time the Develop-&#13;
ment Tax of 2% became applicable on all exports. Up until June 1974, the&#13;
total of export taxes as a share of exports had varied between 6 to 8 percent.&#13;
The new measures are likely to raise the average realized export tax rates by&#13;
a couple of percentage points. Table 3 contains realized export tax rates by&#13;
major commodity categories for the past five years.&#13;
Export Licensing/Export Marketing&#13;
29.       Since September 1973 all exports other than cotton and gum arabic&#13;
have been subject to formal licensing by MinFin's Foreign Trade wing, unless&#13;
the goods are shipped to Saudi Arabic. And exports of cotton and gum arabic&#13;
(as well as sesame and groundnuts) have been in the hands of public sector&#13;
companies since the nationalizations of 1970. The main export goods whose&#13;
marketing remains in private hands are dura, meat, hides and skins, vegetable&#13;
oils, oilcakes and expellers. Licenses for these products are only obtained&#13;
if the proposed transactions meet the minimum export price requirements set by&#13;
the Export Price Committee, which is coordinated by the Foreign Trade wing of&#13;
MinFin and includes members from the Bank of Sudan, Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
and private traders. Periodically, MinFin bans exports of these commodities&#13;
to alleviate domestic scarcities expressed through high prices or physical&#13;
shortages at controlled prices.&#13;
30.       Public sector export marketing was substantially reorganized in the&#13;
four years after the 1970 nationalizations. The Cotton Marketing Corporation,&#13;
fully state-owned, was created in 1971. Gum arabic and oilseeds initially&#13;
continued to be exported through 100% nationalized companies, operating under&#13;
the aegis of the State Trading Corporation. In 1974 the private sector was&#13;

31.        Exchange control applies to all invisible payments.    Certain&#13;
remittances for education abroad and travel are permitted. On the side&#13;
of proceeds the most noteworthy feature is the 60 percent per annum incentive&#13;
bonus paid on remittances to Sudan by nationals resident abroad (other than&#13;
government officials and students), as long as these are kept in a special&#13;
account for at least six months (until January 1974 the incentive rate was&#13;
only 30 percent per annum). The incentive bonus is over and above the 15&#13;
percent exchange subsidy referred to earlier. Though defined in "per annum"&#13;
terms, the bonus is payable only once irrespective of the duration (beyond&#13;
six months) of the deposit.&#13;
B. Domestic Price Control Policies&#13;
32.       With respect to domestic markets, at least three different and&#13;
important exercises of government commodity price setting should be dis-&#13;
tinguished 1/:&#13;
(a) The Ministry of Industry is charged with setting&#13;
ex-factory prices on all domestically manufactured&#13;
products. 2/&#13;
1/   The pricing of publicly produced goods and services is excluded except to&#13;
the extent IPC units fall within the first category.&#13;
2/   Except for sugar and wheat flour where prices are determined by the Sugar&#13;
Corporation and the Supply wing of MinFin, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
(b) MinFin sets minimum wholesale market prices for key&#13;
export crops such as groundnuts, sesame and gum arabic,&#13;
and also determines into-mill prices for major import-&#13;
substituting agricultural products like wheat and&#13;
sugarcane. Into-mill prices of cottonseed are also&#13;
set by MinFin.&#13;
(c) Efforts by MinFin to control wholesale and retail&#13;
prices of a wide range of imported and domestically&#13;
produced products.&#13;
33.       Ex-factory pricing of manufactures and producer-pricing of agri-&#13;
cultural commodities are reviewed in Sections III and IV: only the third&#13;
category is briefly described here. Within this category we need to subdivide&#13;
between:&#13;
(a) specific retail price controls on selected com-&#13;
modities; and&#13;
(b) much more general regulation of wholesale and&#13;
retail prices through the legislation of maxi-&#13;
mum profit margins (on sales) for different&#13;
stages of distribution.&#13;
Specific Retail Price Controls&#13;
34.       Specific retail price ceilings are officially set (under the&#13;
authority of the 1966 Price Control Ordinance) for some 20 "essential"&#13;
consumer items including meat, fish, sugar, tea, coffee, bread, flour,&#13;
certain fruits, vegetables and cottonseed oil. The central unit charged&#13;
with monitoring price control is in the Supply wing of MinFin. For locally&#13;
produced agricultural commodities authority to levy and monitor retail price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
control is delegated to Provincial Commissioners. The effectiveness of price&#13;
control is considered in more detail later, but it is clear that except for&#13;
items like sugar, where government supply backs up legislated prices, price&#13;
control has been generally ineffective. And the creation of a new price&#13;
investigation bureau in the Supply wing in 1974 has not significantly changed&#13;
matters.&#13;
General Regulations on Trade Profits&#13;
35.       MinFin's Supply wing is also charged with checking and enforcing&#13;
adherence of domestic traders to those sections of the 1966 Price Control&#13;
Ordinance which decree maximum rates of profits (on sales) at each stage of&#13;
the distribution chain: importer (for imported commodities), wholesaler,&#13;
and retailer. These regulations apply to all commodities marketed domes-&#13;
tically. The maximum rates vary across commodity categories, which are&#13;
specified in considerable detail (over 50 items in the Price Control Order).&#13;
Moreover, special maxima are laid down in those cases where the different&#13;
stages of distribution are collapsed into one economic agent. Table 4&#13;
illustrates these remarks with a few examples.&#13;
36.       The adherence of traders to these regulations is supposed to be&#13;
enforced through (a) complaints from agents in the distribution chain about&#13;
overcharging by preceding stages; and (b) spot-checks of prices and sales&#13;
invoices by officials from MinFin's Supply wing. As with the retail price&#13;
maxima, the adherence to these rules is limited in all situations where mar-&#13;
kets permit prices higher than those implicit in these regulations (see&#13;
Section V below).&#13;

III. Incentive Policies within Industry 1/&#13;
A. Major Determinants of the Incentive Framework&#13;
37.       The main policy determinants of the incentive framework for industry&#13;
are:&#13;
(a) Foreign trade taxes, quotas and import bans;&#13;
(b) Fiscal concessions;&#13;
(c) Infrastructural incentives;&#13;
(d) Industrial licensing;&#13;
(e) Ex-factory pricing;&#13;
(f) Domestic excise taxation; and&#13;
(g) Allocation of foreign exchange.&#13;
Much of what falls under the first five items is unified in the 1974 Develop-&#13;
ment of Encouragement of Industrial Investment Act, the latest revision in a&#13;
series which started in 1967. This Act (and its 1967 and 1972 predecessors)&#13;
constitutes the basic legislation for industrial policy in Sudan and centers&#13;
broad powers for industrial licensing, grant of protection and fiscal con-&#13;
cessions, ex-factory pricing, etc. on the Minister of Industry. One impor-&#13;
tant general point: ever since the 1972 Act, no explicit discrimination&#13;
is permitted between foreign, local, public and private enterprises in the&#13;
granting of licenses, concessions and facilities. Though we shall refer to it&#13;
frequently (as the 1974 Act), we find it analytically convenient to organize&#13;
our discussion according to the above classification.&#13;
1/   As befits the title, this section is limited to key policy elements&#13;
composing the incentive framework. Numerous other industrial policy&#13;
considerations (such as those relating to manpower development, labor-&#13;
management issues, administrative organization of the IPC, industrial&#13;
free zones, terms of foreign collaboration) are omitted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
Foreign trade taxes, quotas and import bans&#13;
38.       In Section II we provided a general description of the foreign&#13;
trade/payments regime. For those commodities that can be manufactured domes-&#13;
tically the import QRs are the most potent and frequently deployed protective&#13;
device. Import tariffs play a secondary role in protecting domestic industry.&#13;
Table 5 lists manufactured products which enjoyed protection from import bans&#13;
or quotas at the end of 1973. The bans should be interpreted loosely, since&#13;
imports of such items are periodically permitted at the discretion of MinFin&#13;
and the Ministry of Industry if domestic scarcities become really acute. We&#13;
stress the role of QRs because they tend not be noticed: measures of effec-&#13;
tive protection are often computed and analyzed only on the basis of import&#13;
tariffs, because information on other measures is not available. From the&#13;
fact that bans and quotas have to be deployed, it is usually legitimate to&#13;
conclude that the implicit tariffs associated with these QRs are significantly&#13;
higher than the explicit nominal tariffs.&#13;
Fiscal Concessions&#13;
39.       The fiscal concessions under the 1974 Act are schematized below:&#13;
Business Profits Tax (B.P.T.)&#13;
(a) 5 year exemption from commencement of production;&#13;
(b) for subsequent 5 years only profits in excess of&#13;
"10% of the capital of the establishment" are sub-&#13;
ject to tax;&#13;
(c) another 5 year exemption related, pro rata, to the&#13;
increase in capital by the establishment in the first&#13;
10 years; and if profits after such pro rata exemption&#13;
fall below 10% of capital, then complete exemption;&#13;
&#13;

"exemption from payment of customs duties, surcharges&#13;
and any other duties" relating to machinery, equipment&#13;
and spare parts, and raw materials; but the exemption&#13;
does not extend to the Exchange Tax/Subsidy scheme&#13;
administered by the Bank of Sudan;&#13;
Excise Taxes&#13;
(a) exemption from excise duties on locally produced raw&#13;
materials used in production;&#13;

which the establishment had paid for production to be&#13;

40        Similar fiscal concessions were granted under the earlier Acts&#13;
of 1967 and 1972. As in the past, the Minister of Industry, acting on the&#13;
advice of the Advisory Committee for Industrial Development, has the authority&#13;
to grant these fiscal concessions wholly or partially. If the past is any&#13;
guide, the BPT exemptions are wholly granted. For import taxes, the estimates&#13;
of exemptions for the last three fiscal years (Table 6) indicate that fully&#13;
90 percent of assessed import duties was exempted for domestic manufacturing&#13;
industry on both machinery and spare parts and raw materials.&#13;

Infrastructural Incentives&#13;
41.       Four categories of infrastructural incentives can be granted under&#13;
the Industrial Development Acts:&#13;
(a) industrial land at concessionary prices;&#13;
(b) reduced electricity rates for enterprises;&#13;
(c) reduced freight rates on haulage of inputs and&#13;
outputs; and&#13;
(d) reduced local rates.&#13;
In fact the last three have been little used. Thp price reduction on the&#13;
stock of land held by firms under concessions in 1969/70 was estimated at&#13;
E4.3 million. Annuitized at the rate of 10% these concessions were valued&#13;
at only LO.4 million per year, compared to profits tax exemption of W0.6&#13;
million and import duty exemptions of L5.0 million 1/ for that year.&#13;
42.       Quite apart from the Industrial Development Acts, the pricing of&#13;
power in Sudan involves cross-subsidization of commercial and industrial&#13;
establishments by other consumers.&#13;
43.       Against these price reductions in theory and practice for infra-&#13;
structural services to industry, we must juxtapose the oft-repeated view&#13;
that when it comes to physical allocations of scarce transport and power&#13;
availabilities, industry is not a high-priority claimant. Given the severity&#13;
of the transport bottleneck, this claim, if true, could easily outweigh the&#13;
value of the infrastructural subsidies outlined above.&#13;
Industrial Licensing&#13;
44.       We have, so far, dwelt on those government actions which increase&#13;
the private profitability of domestic industrial activities. We turn now&#13;
1/   Estimates by Ministry of Industry and Mining.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
to policy interventions which inhibit the exploitation of such profit oppor-&#13;
tunities. First, among these, is the industrial licensing apparatus, which,&#13;
in principle, must sanction the establishment and expansion of all industrial&#13;
enterprise in Sudan. In fact, quite a few small units are believed to escape&#13;
this apparatus, but their quantitative significance is unlikely to be large,&#13;
especially since such units are automatically denied official access to&#13;
foreign exchange and to the various concessions available under the Industrial&#13;
Development Acts.&#13;
45.       All applications for new plants or expansions are studied by the&#13;
Advisory Committee for Industrial Development, which is chaired by the&#13;
Under-Secretary, Ministry of Industry, and advises the Minister. 1/ Any&#13;
of six rather broad criteria (specified in the 1974 Act) may be used to&#13;
justify approval:&#13;
(a) defense or strategic importance;&#13;
(b) uses local raw materials;&#13;
(c) earns export revenue or substitutes for imports;&#13;
(d) generates employment;&#13;
(e) furthers economic cooperation or integration with&#13;
Arab and African States; and&#13;
(f) increases national income.&#13;
It is virtually impossible to think up an industrial activity proposal which&#13;
will not satisfy at least one of these crlteria!    Hence their value as guides&#13;
for rational selection is dubious. They certainly do not approximate, singly&#13;
or together, social profitability analysis. And no systematic, social profit-&#13;
ability appraisal is apparently done by the licensing authorities in the&#13;
1/   The Committee includes representatives from MinFin, the Director General&#13;
of the Planning Commission, the Bank of Sudan Governor, the Manager of&#13;
CEWA, and representatives of the Sudan Manufacturers' Association.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Ministry. The effective approval of applications is thus a function of&#13;
the drive and initiative of the applicant, some market-information-based&#13;
cash-flow projections, a broad assessment (usually) of import-substitution&#13;
scope, and various discretionary elements in the licensing bureaucracy. It&#13;
is clear therefore, that the checks provided by the licensing mechanism on&#13;
the exploitation of profits signaled by the incentive framework (including&#13;
anticipatory QR protection) are ad hoc, not systematic.&#13;
Ex-Factory Pricing&#13;
46.       With approval comes the grant of protection, concessions and access&#13;
to foreign exchange for imports of machinery, raw materials, etc. When produc-&#13;
tion is initiated, each unit is obliged to obtain approval from the Ministry&#13;
of Industry for its ex-factory prices. All IPC units have certainly been&#13;
subject to this proviso. Its potency with respect to private units is more&#13;
questionable. The Ministry approves prices on a cost-plus basis, using infor-&#13;
mation supplied by the producer for its year of operation. 1/ Among the more&#13;
obvious limitations of this procedure are:&#13;
(a) lack of independent costing checks by the Ministry;&#13;
it relies wholly on information provided by the&#13;
firms;&#13;
(b) in the first year production is usually well below&#13;
capacity, leading to high overhead unit costs,&#13;
which then become permanently ossified in the&#13;
price structure for the products;&#13;
1/   During that year the unit operates under a "provisional price certificate"&#13;
which usually allows it to charge prices of comparable producers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
(c) while the Ministry approves subsequent price&#13;
revisions to take care of changes in costs,_&#13;
these are always upward, since no firm has an&#13;
interest, in a protected market, in owning up&#13;
to cost reductions;&#13;
(d) the unit profit margins permitted in the cost-&#13;
plus pricing formula are associated with very&#13;
different returns to equity, or fixed assets,&#13;
for different firms and sectors, depending on&#13;
the volume of turnover;&#13;
(e) too often prices are fixed on the basis of those&#13;
permitted to other firms without adequate allowance&#13;
for inter-firm differences in machinery, its age,&#13;
packaging, raw material source and product quality&#13;
differences.&#13;
47.        In sum, though the Ministry approves ex-factory prices, much of&#13;
the initiative on the levels at which these are fixed remains with the firms.&#13;
And in protected markets the firms have a clear incentive to bias their&#13;
efforts upwards. Nevertheless, as we shall see in the next subsection,&#13;
ex-factory price control does sometimes check the extent to which firms can&#13;
appropriate the profits implicit in the protected markets.&#13;
Domestic Excise Taxation&#13;
48.       For those industrial commodities on which they are applied,excise&#13;
taxes mop away some-of the rent element between the controlled ex-factory&#13;
price and the protected market clearing price. If ex-factory pricing were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
firmly and independently administered by the Ministry, the level of excise&#13;
taxation would be of little consequence to the firms. But because the&#13;
firms have considerable leeway in reaping the profits in the protected&#13;
markets, excise taxes are a real disincentive. In this respect the 1974&#13;
Act records an advance over the previous status quo. Now new excise taxes&#13;
and increases of existing ones can be levied only with the approval of the&#13;
Minister of Industry. There is no longer any scope for uncoordinated grant&#13;
of protection by one ministry which is unilaterally reduced by another.&#13;
Allocation of Foreign Exchange&#13;
49.       We described in Section II how the Foreign Exchange Budget for each&#13;
fiscal year makes a "global" allocation for the domestic manufacturing sector.&#13;
The Ministry of Industry is responsible for inter-unit allocation. In practice&#13;
this follows a 2-stage procedure. First, foreign exchange is made available&#13;
for capital good imports for newly licensed units and capacity expansion of&#13;
existing establishments. What remains of the "global" allocation is then&#13;
parcelled out to each firm for use towards imports of spares, fuel and raw&#13;
materials. This second-stage allocation is based on the past year's use of&#13;
foreign exchange by different units.&#13;
50.       We point to-two obvious objections to this system of allocation.&#13;
First, the preemptive draft on the available foreign exchange by expansions&#13;
of capacity gives it a de facto priority over foreign exchange for current&#13;
uses, a priority which is difficult to justify in an industrial sector plagued&#13;
by excess capacity, quite often because of foreign exchange scarcity. Second,&#13;
with regard to the second-stage inter-firm allocation of foreign exchange for&#13;
current imports, there seems to be little recourse to economic criteria. The&#13;
application of past-use norms means that loss-making enterprises can continue&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
to receive foreign exchange while profitable ventures are constrained from&#13;
expanding production.&#13;
B. Effective Protection Rates as Measures of Intra-Sector Incentives&#13;
51.       What is the cumulative effect of these policies on the allocation&#13;
of resources within the industrial sector? That is the question to which the&#13;
rest of this Section is addressed. A commonly used technique for aggregating&#13;
the incentive effects of various industri-al policies is to compute the&#13;
effective rates of protection conferred on different lines of industrial&#13;
activity by the totality of incentive policies in operation. For any activity&#13;
the effective rate of protection (ERP) is defined as:&#13;
= (Value Added at Domestic Prices) - (Value Added at International Prices)&#13;
(Value Added at International Prices)&#13;
VAD - VAI&#13;
VAI&#13;
In effect, ERPs measure the degree of protection conferred on domestic factors&#13;
of production by policy-induced differences between domestic and international&#13;
(border) prices for traded goods. Information on value added at domestic prices&#13;
is usually available. The guts of the calculation rest on identifying the&#13;
departures, by commodity, of domestic from international prices, and using this&#13;
information to deflate the domestic gross output and input values to arrive at&#13;
an estimate of value-added at international prices.&#13;
52.       If import tariffs were the only policies creating differences between&#13;
domestic and border prices, then deflations could all be done using informa-&#13;
tion from the Customs Tariff schedule. 1/ In Sudan we have pointed to several&#13;
1/   There would be the added assumption of "no water in the tariff", that is,&#13;
that domestic producers were taking full advantage of the protection&#13;
offered by the tariff structure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
other dimensions of policy which influence the wedge between domestic and&#13;
international prices of traded goods. With this observation in mind we&#13;
begin with a review of two recent efforts at estimating ERPs for Sudanese&#13;
industry.&#13;
A Review of Estimates&#13;
53.       Both sets of estimates draw on the 1971 IDCAS survey of industry,&#13;
which collected data on domestic value-added, gross output at factor cost,&#13;
input values and other variables for SITC categories down to the 4-digit&#13;
level. The set of estimates by Dr. Naseem 1/ is based exclusively on informa-&#13;
tion from the import tariff schedule with respect to the final products; for&#13;
traded inputs, since there are no detailed data on the structure of inputs,&#13;
he assumes uniform tariffs, of 15 percent for raw materials, 35 percent for&#13;
packing materials and 0 percent for non-traded inputs. The sectoral defini-&#13;
tions for which his ERP estimates are prepared are disaggregated only to the&#13;
3-digit SITC level. Table 7 records his estimates of ERPs.&#13;
These estimates have some obvious limitations:&#13;
(a) Though data on the more disaggregated 4-digit&#13;
classification were available, Naseem chose to&#13;
compute estimates at the more aggregated 3-&#13;
digit level. The nominal protection rates used&#13;
for each sector are simple averages of tariffs&#13;
on commodities in that sector, and not weighted&#13;
by value-added or trade share. This means that&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
the nominal (and hence effective) protection&#13;
rates estimated for a 3-digit group as a whole&#13;
may be quite different from those actually&#13;
applying to important commodities within that&#13;
group. An example is the production of edible&#13;
oils which, though it dominates the food pro-&#13;
cessing sector, may enjoy a much lower ERP than&#13;
that estimated by Naseem for the food processing&#13;
sector as a whole.&#13;
(b) The estimates rely exclusively on tariff informa-&#13;
tion; they ignore the effects of other trade&#13;
policies such as QRs, as well as the various&#13;
domestic incentive policies discussed above.&#13;
(c) Even for tariffs, the blanket assumptions regard-&#13;
ing tariff rates for inputs are questionable,&#13;
particularly for some important domestic-raw-&#13;
material-using sectors like textiles, sugar and&#13;
edible oils.&#13;
54.       The ERP estimates computed by the IBRD Survey of the Industrial&#13;
Sector meet some of these objections. To begin with, the commodity classi-&#13;
fication is finer, down to the 4-digit level at which the basic data were&#13;
available. Secondly, these estimates are not limited to information on&#13;
the tariff structure: they take account of the effects of domestic excise&#13;
taxation, and, in a couple of cases, notably textiles, the nominal protec-&#13;
tion rate on the output has been modified by information on domestic vs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
international prices. The nominal rates of protection for inputs are similar&#13;
to those estimated by Naseem; however, adjustments have been made for some&#13;
important industries for which the domestic prices of traded inputs appeared&#13;
to be significantly above or below the 15 percent mark-up on international&#13;
prices that was generally assumed.   Notable examples of such exceptions are&#13;
textiles, edible oils, leather tanning, leather shoes, fruit and vegetable&#13;
canning.  Table 7 compares the IBRD estimates with Naseem's. 1/&#13;
55.       Nonetheless these IBRD estimates can be faulted for two important&#13;
omissions. First, no attempt has been made to include the protective effect&#13;
of QRs on imports, which, as we noted, is so central to the industrial pro-&#13;
tective system. Second, on the other side, the protection-reducing influence&#13;
of ex-factory price control has been largely neglected. Both omissions can&#13;
be explained by the absence (or disregard) of actual domestic vs. inter-&#13;
national price comparisons. We consider the implications of these factors&#13;
below.&#13;
Effective Protection and Ex-Factory Price Control&#13;
56.       We were able to obtain ex-factory control prices for a group of&#13;
commodities for 1971. From this we selected a smaller group of products&#13;
(a) which were relatively homogeneous (as product categories) and (b) for&#13;
which information on comparable imports was available from the recorded&#13;
trade statistics. For each such product we computed the corresponding c.i.f.&#13;
import price, added on 15% as an internal trade-transport margin, and took&#13;
1/   In several cases sectors recorded negative value added at international&#13;
prices. If the data are correct this indicates either waste of real re-&#13;
sources in these industries or the possibility of factor and raw material&#13;
substitution when one moves from protected to free trade regimes. Both&#13;
explanations probably have some validity in Sudan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
the difference between the ex-factory and transport-inclusive-import prices,&#13;
as a percentage of the import price, as a new measure of "nominal protection"&#13;
for the commodity. In effect, this measures the degree to which ex-factory&#13;
price control permits exploitation (in price terms) of the protection con-&#13;
ferred by trade/fiscal regimes.&#13;
57.       Table 8 compares our measure of nominal protection (C) with cor-&#13;
responding nominal protection estimates by Naseem (A) and the IBRD Industry&#13;
Report (B). Because of much greater product comparability we focus on&#13;
the comparison between our estimates and those in the IBRD Report. The&#13;
differences are quite striking. In most cases our estimates of "nominal&#13;
protection" are less than those in the IBRD Report; for six products our&#13;
estimates indicate negative nominal protection. For three products (canned&#13;
tomato paste, laundry soap and refrigerators) our estimates are higher,&#13;
suggesting that ex-factory price control permits full exploitation of the&#13;
nominal tariff protection (net of excises) as well as some of the QR-induced&#13;
premia for these products. As we have no way of knowing whether our small&#13;
sample of products is representative, we cannot generalize about the direc-&#13;
tion in which previous protection estimates for all the other commodities&#13;
should be corrected.&#13;
58.       The differences between our estimates of "nominal protection" and&#13;
those by the IBRD Report imply differences (in the same direction) for cor-&#13;
responding ERP estimates. The problem in computing ERP estimates for the&#13;
products we have singled out is the absence of input data at our level of&#13;
disaggregation. However, for some products we make the assumption that the&#13;
input structure is identical to that underlying the IBRD estimates for the&#13;
corresponding (somewhat more widely defined) sector. On that basis, and using&#13;

the information underlying the IBRD estimates, we have computed ERPs for a&#13;
handful of commodities, employing our estimates of nominal protection. These&#13;
are juxtaposed with the IBRD and Naseem estimates in Table 9.&#13;
59.       We do not wish to make too much of these recomputations.    Our data&#13;
on import prices are particularly fragile, based often on low import volumes,&#13;
which have been sporadically permitted through the QR system to deal with&#13;
occasional acute scarcities. And often these irregular imports are under&#13;
bilateral trade agreements which undermine their use as representatives of&#13;
"international market prices." Nor do the data permit allowances for quality&#13;
differences between domestic and imported commodities; generally these would&#13;
work against domestically produced commodities. Even more important, our anal-&#13;
ysis does not vitiate a central conclusion of the IBRD Report, namely, that the&#13;
trade and fiscal regimes harbor a complex incentive system, characterized by&#13;
sharply divergent levels of ERPs for different industrial activities. Our&#13;
recomputations are simply designed to emphasize that ex-factory price control&#13;
does seem to play a significant role in constraining or permitting the ex-&#13;
ploitation, by domestic manufacturing firms, of protection implicit in the&#13;
trade and fiscal systems. 1/&#13;
C. Industrial Licensing and Resource Allocation&#13;

price policies on the incentive structure guiding resource allocation in&#13;
Sudanese industry. We concluded that the cumulative effect of these policies&#13;
1/   As we shall see later, effective ex-factory price control does not&#13;
necessarily mean that consumers enjoy low prices despite heavy trade&#13;
protection. it is quite possible that final retail prices do take&#13;
advantage of trade protection, implying high profits for commercial&#13;
establishments.&#13;

was to create widely divergent effective rates of protection for different&#13;
lines of industrial activity. Such divergences constitute prima facie&#13;
evidence that the structure of incentives in Sudanese industry does not&#13;
encourage resource allocation according to comparative advantage.&#13;
61.       But whatever the resource-pull signals implicit in the incentive&#13;
policies discussed above, the actual allocation of resources in industry&#13;
has long been subject to licensing. It is quite possible that such screen-&#13;
ing has eliminated, or at least reduced, wasteful resource-use patterns in&#13;
response to the distorted incentive structure. At least up till 1971, there&#13;
seems to be some support for this view. Table 10 records the distribution of&#13;
fixed assets by sub-sector as found by the IDCAS Survey. Some two thirds of&#13;
fixed assets were in a handful of sectors in which it is difficult to deny&#13;
Sudanese comparative advantage. The percentages of fixed assets in these six&#13;
subsectors were, respectively:&#13;
Edible Oil Mills                                 6.7&#13;

If we include printing, beer and leather shoes as viable import substitution&#13;
candidates, the total rises above 70%. Relative to many developing countries&#13;
which have followed the import-substituting industrialization path, this is a&#13;
good record.&#13;

62.       But we must point to some difficulties with this sanguine view.&#13;
First of all, intra-sectoral misallocation of even a quarter of industrial&#13;
fixed assets is a heavy cost for a capital scarce country. Secondly, even&#13;
if the licensing system had reduced misallocation up till 1971, this is no&#13;
reason for defending the present structure of incentives. After all, we&#13;
have to question an incentive structure whose signals hinder rather than&#13;
help a rational allocation of society's resources. Perhaps most importantly,&#13;
we have to recognize that even though over 70% of fixed industrial assets&#13;
seems to be in the "right sectors", this is not guarantee that the capital&#13;
stock is being efficiently used. The high levels of capacity underutilization&#13;
and such facts as continued losses recorded by Sudanese textile companies&#13;
(despite heavy effective protection) certainly indicate the opposite. In&#13;
part, at least, the inefficient use of resources in the "right sectors" (and&#13;
in the "wrong" ones) is fostered by the policies discussed earlier, such as&#13;
the "residual allocation" of foreign exchange for current uses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

IV. Incentive Policies within Agriculture&#13;
63.       As in the case of industry our discussion of incentive policies&#13;
within agriculture will focus on interventions relating to the product&#13;
markets.&#13;
A. Allocational Relevance of Price Signals in Sudanese Agriculture&#13;
64.        In very broad terms agricultural production in Sudan can be parti-&#13;
tioned into three main organizational modes:&#13;
(a) State-managed, participatory irrigation schemes&#13;
(like the Gezira) exploiting the Nile waters;&#13;
(b) Large-scale, private, mechanized farming of the&#13;
clay plains, which stretch across the middle of&#13;
Sudan; and&#13;
(c) Relatively small-scale, traditional farmers in&#13;
the Western savannah and the South.&#13;
There is no question that product prices (for outputs and inputs) are major&#13;
determinants of allocation decisions in the last two organizational forms.&#13;
Within the state-managed irrigation schemes commodity price signals are&#13;
modified by the decisions of the Managing Boards. We touch upon some special&#13;
aspects of these public schemes in sub-section D, below.&#13;
65.       There is also a fairly clear division between those key crops&#13;
which are primarily produced on the public irrigation schemes (long staple&#13;
cotton, sugarcane and wheat) and those which are primarily produced in large&#13;
or small private farms (sorghum, sesame, groundnuts and gum arabic). 1/&#13;
I/   Owing to lack of comparable data the livestock sector is excluded from&#13;
this analysis, as are several crops like dukhn (millet), cassava and&#13;
rice, which are of secondary importance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
Following from above, the allocation of resources among the latter set of&#13;
crops is much more immediately sensitive to incentive signals than is the&#13;
allocation among the former group.&#13;
B. Determinants of the Incentive Framework&#13;
66.       The main policy determinants of the structure of incentives are:&#13;
(a) Foreign trade taxes, subsidies and quotas;&#13;
(b) Producer price policy/marketing arrangements; and&#13;
(c) Local taxation.&#13;
Foreign Trade Taxes, Subsidies and Quotas&#13;
67.       In Section II we gave a general account of the foreign trade/&#13;
payments regime. We need only add a few comments specific to agricultural&#13;
production here. First, and in contrast to the industrial sector, QRs play&#13;
only a small role on the output side of agriculture. Of the four major&#13;
crops produced on private farms, three are regular export items and the&#13;
other (sorghum) an occasional one. Occasionally, QRs in the form of export&#13;
bans affect the market for sorghum, and more frequently, the one for meat.&#13;
As for the crops grown on the public schemes, cotton is the main Sudanese&#13;
export; and though wheat and sugar are imported under QRs, the implicit&#13;
tariffs do not influence production decisions, because the government fixes&#13;
the into-mill price of both crops. On the input side of agriculture, QRs may&#13;
raise the final purchase price of imports like agricultural equipment, jute&#13;
sacks, insecticides and fertilizers above the tariff-inclusive landed cost.&#13;
68.       The export duties and royalties on agricultural products are&#13;
important sources of divergence between international and domestic producer&#13;
prices. So is the 15% export subsidy implicit in the Exchange Tax/Subsidy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
scheme, except when it is denied, as on cotton and gum arabic. But, for&#13;
the reason cited above, import taxes have little influence on the producer&#13;
prices for import substitutes like wheat and sugar. Import taxes, do, of&#13;
course, affect the prices of agricultural inputs.&#13;
Producer Price Policy/Marketing Arrangements&#13;
69.       Policies affecting the pricing and marketing of agricultural com-&#13;
modities are formulated by separate units of government which take decisions&#13;
in isolation, even though the Minister of Finance and National Economy must&#13;
approve all agricultural price decisions. This is an important structural&#13;
weakness in framing coordinated relative price policies within agriculture.&#13;
The supply wing of MinFin advises on the into-mill price of domestic wheat.&#13;
The Sugar Corporation, in effect, sets the into-mill price of sugar cane.&#13;
While the f.o.b. cotton price depends on world market conditions and the&#13;
r4arketing strategy of the State Cotton Marketing Corporation, the "producer&#13;
price" for cotton is a concept made slippery by the intricacies of the "joint-&#13;
account" system in Gezira and other public schemes. The export marketing of&#13;
the three main export crops grown on private farms (groundnuts, sesame and gum&#13;
arabic) is now organized through the semi-public Oilseeds and Gum Arabic&#13;
Corporations, respectively. But the producer price policies for these crops&#13;
are set by the Foreign Trade wing of MinFin. A further word on this.&#13;
70.       For these three crops, MinFin's Foreign Trade wing, in conjunction&#13;
with the relevant marketing corporation, sets minimum prices in wholesale&#13;
markets. These prices vary by region to allow for differences in transport&#13;
costs. If the price offered by the private traders to farmers (or more&#13;
local traders) falls below this floor, the marketing corporation is obliged&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
to purchase directly at these minimum prices. 1/ Private traders who buy&#13;
from the farmer at or above the price minimum are obliged to sell to the&#13;
relevant marketing monopoly. A maximum price for this latter transaction&#13;
is also announced by MinFin. Obviously, if the price for a product is set&#13;
too low (in relation to some border price-relative norms) production is&#13;
discouraged, and smuggling is encouraged. 2/ A classic recent example of&#13;
the latter was the heavy smuggling of gum arabic to Ethiopia in the 1973-74&#13;
crop season, induced by the excessively low prices set by the Gum Arabic&#13;
Corporation.&#13;
71.       We should also make a point on the timing of price decisions.    If&#13;
these price-setting exercises are to influence production, they have to be&#13;
announced in advance of the sowing season. In fact, the prices have generally&#13;
been announced near harvest time, and sometimes revised after that. As a&#13;
result, their main influence has probably been on the smuggling vs. legal&#13;
export decisions and on future price expectations.&#13;
Local Taxation&#13;
72.       Local taxation (ushur) is generally levied at an ad valorem rate&#13;
on marketed production. The effective rates tend to differ across both&#13;
crops and regions. The inter-crop differences contribute to departures&#13;
from international price relatives. The inter-regional differences are&#13;
generally associated with the prosperity of the regions: higher rates in&#13;
1/   This is how the system is supposed to work.   Actual operations may be&#13;
somewhat different.&#13;
2/   Though quantitative estimates are not available, smuggling is believed&#13;
to be an important problem in Sudan. This is hardly surprising given&#13;
the long land borders and inadequate internal communications.&#13;

more prosperous areas.   Though this interferes with the exploitation of&#13;
inter-regional comparative advantages, it does further inter-regional equiLy&#13;
objectives.&#13;
C. Effective Producer Prices and Intra-Sector Incentives&#13;
73.       Ideally, we would have liked to estimate the effective protection/&#13;
promotion implied for different crops by the above policies, in a manner&#13;
analogous to our discussion of ERPs within industry. But such an enquiry&#13;
would require information on current input structure by crop. Given existing&#13;
trade taxes on commodity inputs, different input structures would imply&#13;
different average effective taxation of current inputs relative to inter-&#13;
national prices, which in turn would imply different degrees of protection&#13;
to primary factors, even if producer crop price relatives were in line with&#13;
international prices. Unfortunately, the mission did not obtain detailed&#13;
information, by crop, of per unit use of current inputs like fertilizers,&#13;
insecticides and other chemicals, jute sacks, fuel for agricultural equipment&#13;
and spares. I/ Consequently, our discussion of policy-induced departures&#13;
from international prices is limited to a comparison of effective crop&#13;
producer prices.&#13;
74.       As in the discussion of the industrial sector, our use of inter-&#13;
national prices as norms rests on the notion that they represent (at least&#13;
approximately) the transformation possibilities through foreign trade.&#13;
Strictly speaking, this would be true if Sudan were only a marginal importer&#13;
1/   To include the input side in the analysis of intra-sector incentives,&#13;
we would also have to take account of widely divergent technologies:&#13;
mechanized vs. traditional.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
or exporter of the commodities in consideration, that is, if the "small&#13;
country assumption" were valid. In that case, and if economic efficiency&#13;
were the sole objective, it would be appropriate for domestic resource&#13;
allocation to be guided by the relative international price configuration.&#13;
Conversely, we could judge departures of domestic price relatives from&#13;
international ones as sources of inefficient resource allocation. As we shall&#13;
see below, this pristine view has to be modified whenever the "small country&#13;
assumption" becomes tenuous.&#13;
75.       Table 11 presents data, for recent years, on effective producer&#13;
prices for the major crops in relation to the corresponding export or import&#13;
parity equivalent. 1/ A few explanatory comments are in order. The inter-&#13;
national parity equivalent, in each case, is based.on unit c.i.f. or f.o.b.&#13;
prices from trade accounts (at the official exchange rate) with due allowances&#13;
for handling, storage, transport, etc. The "producer prices" are wholesale&#13;
market prices for all private farm crops, while for the others they are&#13;
either mill prices (wheat and sugar) or a special construction (cotton). The&#13;
differences between the international parity equivalents and producer prices&#13;
are due to export taxes, local commodity taxes-and marketing corporation&#13;
profits (again excepting the special case of long-staple cotton).&#13;
76.       A glance at Table 11 reveals that for all crops producer prices have&#13;
been below international parity equivalents, with the gap (line (d) for each&#13;
crop) ranging from 15-17% for oilseeds to 30-40% for gum arabic and wheat,&#13;
and even higher for sugar in recent years. We can regard this downward bias&#13;
1/   Unfortunately, the information on sugar relates to its refined form&#13;
(which, strictly, is an industrial product) not cane.&#13;

as a cumulative implicit tax (some or all components may be explicit). On&#13;
this basis we conclude that all these crops have been subject to sizeable&#13;
taxation in recent years, and some, particularly gum arabic, wheat and sugar,&#13;
more than others. This implicit output taxation, when coupled with our&#13;
knowledge that commodity inputs are also taxed, leads to the conclusion that&#13;
returns to primary factors in all these crop activities have been subject to&#13;
substantial effective taxation (or negative effective protection), in contrast&#13;
to the protection granted to industrial activities (for a fuller comparison&#13;
see Section V).&#13;
77.       Furthermore, different rates of implicit taxation across crops&#13;
indicate that present incentive policies distort the domestic structure of&#13;
crop price relatives away from the corresponding international ones. As&#13;
a first approximation, this suggests that current domestic price patterns&#13;
are inhibiting Sudan from making efficient use of its international trading&#13;
opportunities. But at this point we pause to note that in several crops,&#13;
particularly long-staple cotton, gum arabic and (perhaps) sesame, Sudanese&#13;
exports do not face perfectly elastic foreign demand. This in turn implies&#13;
that international transformation opportunities should be measured, not by&#13;
the parity price, but by marginal export revenue, which, by definition,&#13;
will be below the parity prices, when demand is less than perfectly elastic.&#13;
What this means is that an efficient crop price pattern in agriculture would&#13;
require the relative domestic price for these crops to be lower than their&#13;
relative international price. Thus, taking 1973-74 as an example, a 12%&#13;
lower price (12% higher implicit tax) for gum arabic relative to groundnuts&#13;
may not be unjustified by differences in structure of external demand. But&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
this argument should not be taken too far. Certainly, it cannot be applied&#13;
to the 40 percent implicit taxation of wheat, a product in which Sudan is a&#13;
marginal importer. This taxation obviously breaches allocation efficiency; it&#13;
clearly arises from a desire to subsidize domestic consumers with low retail&#13;
prices of flour and bread, in turn requiring a low into-flour-mill price, to&#13;
permit the mills to stay in business.&#13;
78.       To sum up, the existing incentive policies seem to engender a&#13;
set of commodity producer prices which is associated with:&#13;
(a) sizeable implicit/explicit taxes on agricultural&#13;
crops, relative to their international parities;&#13;
(b) undetermined levels of input taxation through&#13;
import taxes and, possibly, QR-induced premia;&#13;
(c) these together imply significant effective taxa-&#13;
tion of value-added in crop activities; and&#13;
(d) significant inter-crop differences in implicit&#13;
taxation, which inhibit an efficient inter-crop&#13;
allocation of resources, even after making&#13;
required allowances for differences in external&#13;
demand conditions.&#13;
Perhaps as important as these quantitative conclusions is the finding that the&#13;
administrative procedure and responsibility for designing the relative price&#13;
framework in agriculture are severely fragmented.&#13;
D. Public Irrigated Agricultural Schemes: Special Aspects&#13;
79.       The agricultural parastatals are partnership arrangements between&#13;
tenants, who are responsible for supplying labor (their own or hired), the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
Government, which provides land and irrigation, and a managing board which&#13;
supervises all aspects of the scheme. Cotton is usually the "joint account"&#13;
crop. Inputs provided jointly for the scheme under the managing board's&#13;
supervision include land preparation, inspection and extension services,&#13;
fertilizers, spraying of pesticides, ginning, bailing and transport of&#13;
cotton. Since 1966, some of the labor costs, originally borne by the tenant,&#13;
have also been charged to the "joint account". All these joint costs are&#13;
charged against gross sales revenue from cotton and the profits distributed&#13;
amongst the partners according to agreed proportions. For the other crops&#13;
in the rotation the tenant bears much (but not all) of the cost and appro-&#13;
priates all the sale proceeds.&#13;
80.       The schemes are run somewhat as a vertically integrated enterprise&#13;
by the managing board, the crucial allocative agent. The board decrees&#13;
the cropping pattern, within each tenancy, for every crop year. It ensures&#13;
the delivery of machine services, water and current commodity inputs at&#13;
the right times and right places according to a detailed program. The only&#13;
productive factor over which the tenant retains control is his own and hired&#13;
labor.&#13;
81.       This perception turns the analysis of factor allocation response&#13;
to agricultural commodity prices into a two-stage problem:&#13;
-    the inter-crop allocation of land and complementary&#13;
capital, where the managing board is the allocative&#13;
agent;&#13;
-    the inter-crop allocation of labor, where the tenant&#13;
plays the main role.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
Inter-Crop Allocation of Land&#13;
82.       Clearly, if commodity prices are to play an important allocative&#13;
role, the Board has to be sensitive to them. The experience of recent years&#13;
has highlighted the slowness with which the boards alter cropping patterns&#13;
in response to changing commodity prices. Taking the Gezira as an example,&#13;
this sluggishness can be explained by the Board's preoccupation with cotton,&#13;
the only joint account crop, and hence the only crop in whose income the Board&#13;
has a share. When relative prices move against cotton and in favor of other&#13;
cash crops like oilseeds and wheat, the Board is slow to adjust cropping&#13;
accordingly, since it foresees budget problems for itself if acreage is&#13;
shifted out of cotton.&#13;
Inter-Crop Allocation of Labor&#13;
83.       The present system also distorts incentives for inter-crop labor&#13;
allocation. Leaving aside changes in relative prices, the joint account&#13;
system discourages producers from allocating labor to cotton. This is because&#13;
the tenant only receives forty-odd percent of the "net income" from cotton,&#13;
while he retains the entire sales proceeds from other cash crops like wheat,&#13;
groundnuts and vegetables. And this bias has been increasing steadily over&#13;
time, as the joint account costs encompass more and more of field opera-&#13;
tions, 1/ which were formerly on the tenants' own account, including some&#13;
operations related to non-cotton crops. This process has reduced the rate&#13;
of "net income" from cotton, and increased tenants' real net income from&#13;
other crops.&#13;

tions of the Public Sector in Sudanese Agriculture", Department of&#13;
Rural Economy, Research Bulletin No. 17, 1970.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
84.       Furthermore, when it comes to changes in relative prices, the&#13;
variations in the cotton price are transformed, by the joint account system,&#13;
into much larger percentage changes in "net income" per unit of cotton.&#13;
Consequently, while the reallocation of land in response to relative price&#13;
changes is too slow, the reallocation of labor may be too fast.&#13;
Joint Account vs. Land/Water Charge&#13;
85.       The above difficulties with the incentives for labor allocation&#13;
under the public agricultural schemes as presently constituted have led to the&#13;
suggestion of a Land and Water Charge (LWC) alternative. As proposed (and&#13;
accepted in the Rahad project) this would substitute for the present joint&#13;
account revenues of the Government and the managing board. The LWC is to be&#13;
levied as a flat fee per unit of land. 1/ It is considered as a service&#13;
charge to government for the provision of irrigated land. 2/ In addition,&#13;
in the Rahad model, the costs of common operational services such as various&#13;
stages of land preparation, spraying, etc., are charged to all crops.&#13;
86.       Compared to the present Gezira system, the LWC approach removes&#13;
the labor allocation bias against cotton. And since the Board's income is&#13;
no longer cotton-specific, it has no particular reason to delay shifts out&#13;
of cotton, if product prices point in that direction. But even though the&#13;
land allocation bias in favor of cotton is gone, it is not clear that the LWC&#13;
system strengthens the incentives for a speedy response to changing relative&#13;
1/   To the extent it is a uniform land-related cess, and does not allow for&#13;
differences in soil fertility etc., the LWC does not help inter-tenant&#13;
equity.&#13;
2/   Note that as long as the LWC does not vary with water use, it performs&#13;
no separate rationing of that resource.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
product prices. After all, the Board's income is now guaranteed; it does&#13;
not depend on gross profits of the scheme. 1/ It is therefore important&#13;
to keep the Board's cropping pattern decisions flexible and open to pressure&#13;
from tentants, whose net income is sensitive to the cropping choice.&#13;
1/   An alternative system, which would be neutral (inter-crop) with respect&#13;
to both land and labor allocation, and would give the board a direct&#13;
stake in the scheme's income, would be to extend the "joint account"&#13;
to all crops in the scheme. But the problems of policing the monopoly&#13;
marketing of crops other than cotton may make such a scheme difficult or&#13;
impossible to impiement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

V. Inter-Sectoral Bias in Incentive Policy&#13;
87.       Thus far we have dwelt on the implications of the incentive struc-&#13;
ture for resource allocation within major sectors. We turn now to address a&#13;
broader question outlined in the Introduction:&#13;
Does the current policy framework harbor any overall incentive&#13;
bias in favor of agriculture or industry?&#13;
Needless to say, our attempt to formulate a quantitative response will be&#13;
based on even more fragile data than employed hitherto. But nevertheless&#13;
we believe that our analysis is instructive and the results correct within&#13;
broad orders of magnitude. Our basic approach is the same as the one we&#13;
employed within sectors, namely, to estimate the effective protection (or&#13;
taxation) conferred on different lines of activity by the totality of incen-&#13;
tive policies. In this section, "line of activity" refers to broad production&#13;
sectors. We begin with agriculture.&#13;
A. Effective Protection (Taxation) of Agriculture&#13;
88.       We draw upon our analysis in Section IV.   As we noted there, we&#13;
were precluded from calculating effective protection for different crops by&#13;
the absence of data, by crop, on intermediate input structure. We do however&#13;
have some information on the structure of inputs into crop agriculture as a&#13;
whole. This, together with our previous estimates of implicit output taxation&#13;
on the main crops, will form the basis of our present analysis. Owing to the&#13;
limited coverage of our work on outputs, we cannot embrace the entire agri-&#13;
culture sector; we confine our overall estimate to the five main cash crops&#13;
(cotton, groundnuts, sesame, gum arabic and wheat) on which we have adequate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
information.  We choose 1972/73 for this analysis for several reasons:    it&#13;
is the latest year for which final production estimates, by crop, were avail-&#13;
able; the world agricultural commodity boom had only just begun, so the price&#13;
information is not too unrepresentative; and we had price estimates for all&#13;
crops (except sesame, for which we use the 1973/74 data).&#13;
Output Values&#13;
89.       For the five crops listed in Table 12 we take the 1972/73 produc-&#13;
tion estimates, and use our price information (from Table 11, Section IV)&#13;
to compute two sets of figures: domestic value of output (at producer prices)&#13;
and international value of output (at international parity equivalents). By&#13;
adding across crops we obtain a total for each set of figures.&#13;
Input Values&#13;
90.       We obtained information on the structure of intermediate inputs&#13;
into crop agriculture for 1970/71 (Table 13). 1/ We assume that this struc-&#13;
ture of inputs holds for 1972/73. We also had information on total inter-&#13;
mediate inputs used in modern and traditional crop agriculture in 1971/72&#13;
from published national income estimates (which include information on the&#13;
producer value of crops in that year). From these elements, we constructed&#13;
our estimates of the value of intermediate inputs used in our five crops&#13;
(total) in 1972/73 at both domestic producer and international prices, as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a) We first inflated the value of intermediate inputs&#13;
used in modern agriculture in 1971/72 by 15% to make&#13;
1/   These estimates, unfortunately, exclude information on fuel and spares&#13;
for agricultural machinery and pumps.&#13;

it comparable to our 1972/73 data (this is based&#13;
on the 15% nominal increase in agricultural crop&#13;
value addcd between the two years 1/);&#13;
(b) Since in 1971/72, according to national income&#13;
figures, our five crops accounted for 81% of&#13;
modern sector gross crop value, 2/ we took this&#13;
proportion of the total value of intermediate&#13;
inputs computed above, as our estimate of inter-&#13;
mediates used in our five crops;&#13;
(c) We then disaggregated this by commodity category&#13;
on the basis of the input structure information&#13;
we had for 1970/71. Though the latter is supposed&#13;
to be for total crop agriculture, it is likely to&#13;
be more representative of modern agriculture, since&#13;
it consists solely of imported inputs; 3/&#13;
(d) Using information on effective import tax rates&#13;
for 1972 and 1973 for the major input categories,&#13;
1/   Provisional estimates by the Department of Statistics.&#13;
2/   One of our crops, groundnuts, is also produced in "traditional" agri-&#13;
culture; but we do not think this introduces significant error in our&#13;
calculation.&#13;
3/   By ignoring domestic intermediate inputs and some imported inputs like&#13;
fuel, we underestimate total intermediate input use. This turn means&#13;
that we overestimate value added in both domestic and international&#13;
prices. In the present situation, where both inputs and outputs are&#13;
taxed relative to international prices, this means that the true rate of&#13;
negative effective protection is even higher (more negative) than our&#13;
estimate suggests.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
we deflate the corresponding domestic input&#13;
value figures to obtain an estimate of total&#13;
intermediate inputs at international prices for&#13;
our five crops.&#13;
91.       We now have all the ingredients of an effective rate of protection&#13;
computation. Putting it together gives the answer that the average effective&#13;
rate of protection in 1972/73, for the five cash crops we singled out, was&#13;
-27%. Equivalently, the prevailing incentive policies exacted an effective&#13;
tax of 27% on value added in these five crops. This is a substantial rate&#13;
of discouragement by any standards. True, the estimate is restricted to&#13;
five cash crops. But these crops (in 1971/72) accounted for four-fifths&#13;
of modern sector gross crop output and nearly half of total (including tradi-&#13;
tional) crop output. And when one recognizes that it is the development of&#13;
these cash crops which must form the base of future Sudanese economic growth,&#13;
the judgment on the structure Qf incentive policies has to be adverse.&#13;
B. Effective Protection of Industry&#13;
92.       For comparison, we now try to arrive at a similar "average" figure&#13;
for effective protection to indu8try. As our basis we take the ERP estimates&#13;
of the IBRD Industrial Survey Report. We have already noted that these esti-&#13;
mates are biased downwards because they take no account of premia induced by&#13;
QRs, and biased upwards because they generally neglect ex-factory price con-&#13;
trol. But given existing data limitations they remain the best available&#13;
ingredients for attempting an average estimate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
93.       The IBRD Report computes ERPs for commodities whose value added&#13;
aggregates to 57% of total value added in the firms surveyed by IDCAS. 1/&#13;
Seven of the commodities it covers were estimated to have negative value&#13;
added at international prices, which precluded meaningful estimates of ERPs,&#13;
and they therefore had to be excluded from our average measure. 2/ Excluding&#13;
these seven products leaves about 35% of total industrial value added at&#13;
factor cost (as surveyed by IDCAS) for 1971 in our sample. Using the domestic&#13;
value added in each of our commodities (Table 14) as weights, we compute the&#13;
average ERP provided to these commodities (for "spinning and weaving" and&#13;
"leather tanning"), we pick the lowest of alternative estimates presented in&#13;
the IBRD Report.&#13;
94.       The estimated average effective rate of protection to the products&#13;
in our sample turns out to be 170%. This is an estimate based on 1971&#13;
information. Since then, further tariff concessions to approved industries&#13;
on imports of raw materials under new Industrial Development Acts have&#13;
undoubtedly increased the level of average effective protection. We compare&#13;
our 170% estimate for industry with the previous -27% average estimate for&#13;
agriculture. Despite all the undoubted limitations of the data and our&#13;
methodology, the overall conclusion seems to be inescapable:&#13;
The structure of incentive policies in the&#13;
Sudanese economy provides considerably greater induce-&#13;
ment for allocation of resources to industry than to&#13;
1/   The IDCAS 1971 survey was limited to establishments employing more&#13;
than 25 (more than 100 outside the Three Towns area).&#13;
2/   As noted in Section III, negative value added at world prices points&#13;
to a distorted incentive structure, but it defies measurement.&#13;

agriculture. So these policies work against the&#13;
efficient exploitation of Sudan's oft-diagnosed&#13;
long-term comparative advantage in agriculture.&#13;
C. Protection for the Commerce Sector&#13;
95.       We have, so far, analyzed the incentives for factor allocation&#13;
within and between two major productive sectors in the Sudanese economy.&#13;
We should also devote some attention to the Commerce sector, which in 1972/73&#13;
is credited witn generating twice as much value added as industry and more&#13;
than half of the amount attributed to agriculture. 1/ And even this is likely&#13;
to be a sericus underestimate since the national income estimates are based&#13;
on the legislated profit margins for trade (recall Section II.B above),&#13;
not on actual profits which are generally believed to be much higher.&#13;
96.       Unfortunately, the commerce sector does not lend itself to quanti-&#13;
tative analysis. "Output" is a diffuse concept here. And there is every&#13;
reason to understate incomes and profits in this sector and no reason to&#13;
overstate them. Nor do the business tax accounts provide much guidance, since&#13;
the collections from this sector are mostly based on presumptive assessments,&#13;
not on a careful audit, which is precluded by a weak tradition (and lack of&#13;
legislation) of keeping and maintaining accounts. Though quantitative esti-&#13;
mates are lacking, we have several good reasons to believe that the commerce&#13;
sector occupies a privileged and protected position in the economy.&#13;
97.       First, the trading sector is clearly well positioned to reap many&#13;
of the scarcity rents created by tight import controls, for the import&#13;
licensing system gives it direct access to the scarce foreign commodities.&#13;
I/   For 1972/73 sectoral GDP estimates at market prices in Sudanese i&#13;
z1ilion were:  Agriculture = 258; Mauufacturing = 79; Commerce = 147.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
Though in principle trading profits are controlled by the unit profit margin&#13;
maxima legislated in the 1966 Price Control Ordinance, in fact this ordinance&#13;
is honored more in the breach. Some idea of the effectiveness of price&#13;
control may be gauged from the data in Table 15. Though the table refers to&#13;
domestically produced items mostly under direct retail price control (recall&#13;
the distinction from Section II.B), all indications point to a similar state&#13;
of affairs for commodities under the general profit margin controls.&#13;
98.       Second, the trading sector probably benefits greatly from the&#13;
import controls imposed to protect domestic manufacturing. We noted in&#13;
Section III how the system of ex-factory price control sometimes prevents&#13;
domestic manufacturing firms from taking full price advantage of the implicit&#13;
protection conferred by the QR system. But whereas ex-factory price control&#13;
is relatively easy to apply, the controls weaken at subsequent stages of&#13;
distribution, permitting the traders to appropriate much of the margin between&#13;
the ex-factory, controlled price and the market-clearing retail price. 1/&#13;
99.       An indication of the economic power and sophistication of the Sudanese&#13;
trading sector can be obtained by a glance at the history of the "Nil Value"&#13;
import license system. It began in April 1972 to permit residents to repatriate,&#13;
in commodity form, foreign exchange held abroad. 2/ Within the first year of&#13;
1/   It may be thought that the system of profit margin maxima for each&#13;
distinct stage of distribution would create incentives for an economic&#13;
agent at one stage to police the earlier one. In fact, such complaints&#13;
are subject to the sanction of disrupted supply. In any case, in a&#13;
heavily protected system, there is room for all stages to make "super-&#13;
normal" profits.&#13;
2/   Such holdings would accumulate through business links with Sudanese&#13;
residents in foreign countries, chiefly in the Gulf area.&#13;

its operation, fiscal 1972/73, "nil value" imports amounted to b 17.2 million.&#13;
In the subsequent year they were i 26.0 million or about 15% of total imports.&#13;
And in the first seven months of fiscal 1974/75 these imports had cumulated to&#13;
i 16.9 million, before the system was suspended for review. It is unlikely&#13;
that such large sums only represent foreign exchange savings of Sudanese&#13;
nationals. They were much more likely to constitute a "white" link in a&#13;
cycle of illegal export-import-currency deals.&#13;
100.      Indeed, it is possible to argue that the protection conferred on&#13;
the commerce sector has drawn resources (especially entrepreneurial talent)&#13;
from the productive sectors, and slowed the development of the latter.&#13;

VI. Incentives for Foreign Trade&#13;
A. Norms for Trade Policy&#13;
101.      In Section II we gave a synoptic account of the foreign trade/&#13;
paym..,nts regime. We now attempt to evaluate the incentives for foreign&#13;
trade which are implicit in this regime, and we try to include the effect&#13;
of some of the non-trade policies, such as agricultural pricing, which have&#13;
profound implications for foreign trade incentives. Evaluation presupposes&#13;
norms. A word on these is in order.&#13;
102.      The prescription of classical economic theory is "unified exchange&#13;
rates" -- a trade/payments regime in which the effective exchange rate (the&#13;
number of domestic currency units earned or paid per unit of foreign currency)&#13;
for all transactions is equated, after taking into account the operation of&#13;
taxes, subsidies and quantitative restrictions. 1/ Under such a regime the&#13;
incentive to earn a dollar of foreign exchange through exports is equated,&#13;
at the margin, with the incentive to save a dollar through import substitu-&#13;
tion, and within exports and imports the incentive is equal across commodity&#13;
categories. The two main qualifications to this prescription are (a) cases&#13;
where the country has monopoly power in foreign trade, when optimum trade&#13;
taxes are indicated, and, more importantly, (b) that it embodies a static&#13;
analysis with no thought to the evolution of comparative advantage.&#13;
103.      On the side of imports, Sudan is a marginal importer of all com-&#13;
modities, a "price-taker" in every sense. For some of its exports (notably&#13;
1/   Of course, the simplest unified exchange rate regime (barring the presence&#13;
of monopoly power in trade) is a fully liberalized regime with no taxes&#13;
and subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
long-staple cotton, gum arabic and sesame) Sudan commands a significant&#13;
share of world trade, but the scope for optimum tax intervention is severely&#13;
limited by the presence of close substitutes (for example, medium-staple&#13;
cotton and synthetics in one case and other vegetable oils in another) which&#13;
ensure a fairly-price-elastic foreign demand pattern for these products.&#13;
As for dynamic comparative advantage, it is difficult to find fault with&#13;
past analyses which have stressed Sudan's long-term development potential&#13;
as an agricultural exporter. For this to be exploited, incentives in the&#13;
trade/payments regime should be at least neutral as between exports and&#13;
import substitution and, if anything, biased in favor of exports. Using&#13;
this norm we can evaluate the existing structure of trade policy.&#13;
B. Bias in the Trade/Payments Regime&#13;
Indices of Bias&#13;
104.      The simplest index of bias is in terms of the effective exchange&#13;
rates for exports (EERX) and imports (EERM).&#13;
Bias = B = EERX - O(1+s )    1+sx&#13;
EERM  O(l+t)      1+t&#13;
m        m&#13;
where,&#13;
0 = official exchange rate per unit of foreign currency (dollar)&#13;
s   =  effective average rate of export subsidy (tax is negative subsidy)&#13;
t   '  effective average rate of import tax.&#13;
m&#13;
Therefore, in terms of this index:&#13;
B = I implies neutral trade/payments regime&#13;
B &gt; 1 export-biased trade/payments regime&#13;
B &lt; 1 import-substitution-biased trade/payments regime&#13;
And in a particular direction, the percentage departure from unity would indi-&#13;
cate the degree of bias.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
105.      In a QR-controlled import regime, like Sudan's, this index needs&#13;
some modification. Wherever the QRs are effective constraints they induce&#13;
premia over and above the landed cost (import tax inclusive) of imports&#13;
and the normal internal distribution margins. The final purchaser of imports&#13;
has to surrender more Sudanese pounds per dollar than would be indicated by&#13;
0(1+tm); 1/ or, in other words, the effective exchange rate for imports is&#13;
higher than O(1+t ).   If p  is the average QR-induced premium between the&#13;
landed cost of imports and their domestic market price (making due allowance&#13;
for normal internal distribution costs), as a ratio of c.i.f. import value,&#13;
then we estimate&#13;
EERM - 0(l+tm+p m)&#13;
and recompute bias as&#13;
B = EERX = 0(1+s X)     =  1+s&#13;
EERM   0(1+tm+pm)       +t+Pm&#13;
106.      In fact, for lack of data on domestic market prices of imports, we&#13;
were unable to estimate p . Hence our estimates are confined to the simpler&#13;
index of bias, which implicitly and arbitarily sets p = 0. This in turn&#13;
means that we consistently underestimate the bias in favor of import substitu-&#13;
tion (or, equivalently, overestimate the bias in favor of exports).&#13;
Estimates of Bias&#13;

for 1972 where, because the measure was introduced a quarter of the way&#13;
through the year, a pro-rate attribution has been estimated. The export&#13;
subsidy side of the scheme is more complicated. The effective subsidy has&#13;
been estimated by subtracting the net fiscal proceeds of the scheme (for the&#13;
two fiscal years over which it has operated) from 15% of the corresponding&#13;
export values (the amount of subsidy that would have been paid out had it&#13;
not been denied to certain commodities: cotton and gum arabic), and taking&#13;
the residual as a percentage of the export values. 1/ Columns (3) and (6)&#13;

108.      The data reveal a pronounced bias against exports, to the tune&#13;
of nearly 40% when averaged over the past five years. Furthermore, the&#13;
imposition of the Exchange Tax/Subsidy scheme in 1972 went only a small way&#13;
towards reducing the degree of bias (from 40 to 35%), for the rather obvious&#13;
reason that the export subsidy element of the scheme was severely limited by&#13;
the exclusion of cotton and gum arabic. Finally, we must emphasize that these&#13;
are underestimates of bias against exports becuase of our neglect of the&#13;
QR-induced premia.&#13;

Bias and Inflation&#13;
109.      The above discussion of bias in the trade regime would be adequate&#13;
if there were no domestic or world inflation. But both are stark facts of&#13;
recent economic life, and their implications for bias have to be considered.&#13;
Let us first examine the effect of domestic inflation alone. Under fixed&#13;
exchange rates, with no QRs, and making the "small-country" assumption (i.e.&#13;
no significant monopoly power in world trade), the effect of domestic infla-&#13;
tion is to increase the profitability of producing non-tradeables, relative to&#13;
the tradeables. As between tradeables inflation has roughly neutral effects&#13;
on exports and import substitutes: both become less profitable compared to&#13;
non-tradeables. Put in another way, the EERs for both exports and imports&#13;
decline in real terms. Whatever the pre-inflation export/import-substitution&#13;
bias in the trade regime, it continues roughly unchanged.&#13;
110.      But if imports are largely controlled by QRs, as in Sudan, this&#13;
analysis has to be seriously modified. The excess demand in domestic markets&#13;
bids up not only the price of domestically-produced non-tradeables, but also&#13;
the prices of quota-restricted imports. Even though the nominal c.i.f. and&#13;
landed cost of imports stays constant (under our assumptions of world price&#13;
stability and fixed exchange rate) in Sudanese pounds, the domestic market&#13;
prices of imports can soar as excess demand drives up the QR-induced premia&#13;
(the pm)* There are no corresponding nominal price increases for exports.&#13;
Consequently, domestic inflation, with QR-contolled imports, tends to increase&#13;
the bias of the existing trade/payments regime against exports.&#13;
111.      If world market prices are rising simultaneously, then it is the&#13;
difference in rates of change of domestic and international price levels which&#13;
is important to our analysis. To the extent domestic inflation outstrips world&#13;
inflation, the prices of domestic non-tradeables and QR-controlled imports in-&#13;
crease relative to exports and non-QR-controlled imports; or, equivalently,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
to that extent the real EERs for exports and non-QR-controlled import sub-&#13;
stitutables are reduced. 1/&#13;
112.      The quantitative assessment of these inflation-related aspects is&#13;
plagued in the Sudanese situation by the absence of reliable price indices,&#13;
not to mention some serious conceptual problems regarding the choice of appro-&#13;
priate deflators. But we might get some flavor of the dimensions involved&#13;
by looking at some crude price index comparisons. Table 17 records data on&#13;
some recent price movements.&#13;

113.      Though we have included it for completeness, we regard the Sudanese&#13;
wholesale price index as particularly unsuitable for measuring price changes of&#13;
domestically marketed goods, because the index is heavily dominated by traded&#13;
goods, and that, too, at border prices (i.e. exclusive of premia for the&#13;
imported commodities). Comparing the C.O.L. indices with the IIP, it appears&#13;
that up until 1973 domestic inflation was at comparable, or slower, rates&#13;
1/   This discussion of world inflation abstracts from the terms of trade shifts&#13;
which are associated with relative price changes in world markets. These&#13;
have separate, and profound, effects outside the scope of this analysis.&#13;

than world inflation. But in 1974 domestic inflation was at well over 20&#13;
percent, while the IIP rose only about 12 percent. So since 1970 the cumu-&#13;
lative price level increase in Sudan has been broadly comparable to the world&#13;
price level increase, indicating no significant difference between nominal&#13;
and real EERs. But the recent acceleration of domestic inflation at sharper&#13;
rates than world inflation will, if continued, reduce real EERs (that is,&#13;
appreciate the currency) and increase the bias of the trade/payments regime&#13;
against exports, for the reasons outlined above.&#13;
C. Effects of Non-Trade Interventions&#13;
114.      At least two kinds of non-trade policy interventions need to be&#13;
considered in our analysis of bias: (a) domestic excise taxation and (b)&#13;
implicit and explicit taxation of agricultural products through producer&#13;
pricing and marketing arrangements. As the information for the latter is&#13;
available only for 1972/73 and 1973/74, and that too on a fiscal year basis,&#13;
we shall rework the bias estimates to reflect these non-trade policy elements&#13;
only for 1973, using raw information for fiscal 1972/73 and 1973/74. Needless&#13;
to add, the estimates which emerge from our sometimes crude computations should&#13;
be treated as illustrative, not as definitive results of finely honed research.&#13;
Domestic Excise Taxation&#13;
115.      The effect of domestic excise taxation is to counteract, to some&#13;
degree, the import-substitution incentives provided by the trade/payments&#13;
regime. 1/ The three commodities which are both important in the import tax&#13;
1/   Since domestic excise taxes are rebated on exports, they do not consti-&#13;
tute an additional source of effective export taxation.&#13;

statistics and excised are: petroleum products, cigarettes and sugar. For&#13;
each our procedure will be to subtract the estimated excise tax rate from&#13;
the corresponding import tax rate (as recorded in Table 2) and make the&#13;
necessary downward adjustments in the average effective import tax rate (tm)&#13;
which enters in our measure of overall bias.&#13;
116.      The excise taxation of petroleum products, when averaged for 1972/73&#13;
and 1973/74, was at rates comparable to the import tax rates (averaged for&#13;
1973 and 1974, Jan.-Sept.) recorded in the trade data (see Table 2). Hence&#13;
the reduction in tm recorded in Table 18 reflects an assumption that import&#13;
taxes are fully offset by domestic excises for petroleum products.&#13;
117.      The three specific excise tax rates on cigarettes average at 6S7.3&#13;
per kg., compared to an import tax total (import plus consumption duties) of&#13;
11.7 per kg. 1/ Hence, the reduction in tm in Table 18 reflects an offset&#13;
of 62 percent (=(7.3/11.7)xlOO) of the import taxes collected on cigarettes&#13;
in 1973.&#13;
118.      Ex-factory sales of domestically produced sugar totalled L12.1 mil-&#13;
lion for 1972/73 and 1973/74, while the value of excise duties collected was&#13;
64 million, indicating an effective excise duty rate of 33 percent. 2/ This&#13;
is comparable to an effective import tax rate of 34.6 percent indicated by&#13;
the Customs returns for 1973 (Table 2). Hence, as in the case of petroleum&#13;

products, we assume a full offset of the import substitution incentives&#13;
implicit in the import taxes, when we record the associated change in tm&#13;
in Table 18.&#13;
119.      The cumulative effect of domestic excise taxation of these three&#13;
key commodities leads to an adjustment of the estimate of tm for 1973 from&#13;
54 percent (inclusive of the 15 percent exchange tax) downwards by 13 per-&#13;
centage points to 41 percent.&#13;
Agricultural Producer Pricing&#13;
120.      We have already seen (Section IV) how government policies with&#13;
respect to producer prices and marketing of key cash crops impose a heavy&#13;
tax on agricultural production. Here we examine whether such implicit taxa-&#13;
tion biases incentives for import substitution or exports.&#13;
121.      Of the five crops we consider, only wheat can be regarded as an&#13;
import-substitution commodity in 1972-74. In the 1972/73 crop year there&#13;
was an implicit tax on domestic wheat of 31 percent relative to the import&#13;
parity equivalent (Table 11). In 1973/74 this had increased to 40 percent.&#13;
We take 36 percent as the mean. This rate of implicit taxation on domestic&#13;
production, can, in certain respects, be viewed as equivalent to a wheat&#13;
import subsidy at the same rate. On that basis we can make another downward&#13;
adjustment of the tm rate estimated for 1973. In addition we have to make&#13;
a downward adjustment for the average rate of import duties collected on wheat&#13;
and the exchange tax on it, elements which presently boost the unadjusted&#13;
estimate of tm. The net result can be treated as a 57 percent import sub-&#13;
sidy on wheat which, when accounted for, entails another 2.8 percentage point&#13;
downward adjustment of the estimate of tm for 1973.&#13;
122.      We now turn to the implicit taxation of export crops.     Whereas&#13;
the non-trade measures discussed so far have led to downward revisions of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
our trade-policy-based estimate of t , reducing the degree of anti-export&#13;
bias, the implicit taxation of exportables will work in the opposite direc-&#13;
tion, but through reduction of the estimate of sx.&#13;
123.      Cotton, as discussed earlier, is a very special case, because of&#13;
the intricacies of the "joint account" system prevailing in the agricultural&#13;
parastatals where it is almost exclusively grown. A very crude (and known-to&#13;
be on the low side) guess at implicit taxation of cotton with respect to the&#13;
export parity is obtained by taking the "proprietory receipts" from agricul-&#13;
tural schemes as a percentage of cotton exports. The average for fiscal&#13;
1972/73 and 1973/74 is 13.9 percent. 1/ Using the 1973 cotton export value as&#13;
a base this rate of taxation amounts to a reduction of sx by 7.8 percentage&#13;
points (Table 18).&#13;
124.      For gum arabic, other than export taxes and royalties which already&#13;
have been considered, other taxes and marketing corporation profits (a form&#13;
of implicit taxation) average at 5.9 percent for 1972/73 and 1973/74. For&#13;
19.73, this rate of additional taxation amounts to a downward revision of sx&#13;
by only 0.3 percent.&#13;
125.      Our information on the groundnuts pricing structure attributes a&#13;
cost equal to 50 percent of f.o.b. value (this is an average for 1972/73 and&#13;
1973/74 to "port charges, commissions, weighing, transport etc.". It is hard&#13;

implicit taxation.  If, however, we do consider it as reflecting true eco-&#13;
nomic costs, then the only source of taxation in addition to the export taxes/&#13;
subsidies already considered is the local tax, ushur, which averaged at 6.3&#13;
percent of f.o.b. value for the last two crop years. This contributes a&#13;
revision of s for 1973 of -0.6 percentage points.&#13;
126.      For sesame, too, the only source of additional taxation in crop&#13;
years 1973-74 was ushur, which amounted to 10.7 percent of f.o.b. price.&#13;
This meant a downward revision of s   in 1973 by 0.8 percentage points.&#13;
Recomputation of Bias for 1973&#13;
127.      Taken together, additional sources of implicit and explicit taxation&#13;
on these four export crops cumulate to a reduction of s    for 1973 by 9.5 per-&#13;
centage points. And, for reasons cited above, we know this reduction to be an&#13;
underestimate.  To be set against this is our estimated reduction of t    by&#13;
15.8 percentage points (see Table 18), attributed chiefly to domestic excise&#13;
taxation on sugar, petroleum and cigarettes, and partially to the implicit&#13;
taxation of domestic wheat production. Using these adjusted estimates of&#13;
t and sX, we recompute the bias in the incentive regime as between exports&#13;
and import substitution. Table 18 records our revised bias index of B for&#13;
1973 at 0.61, implying a 39 percent anti-export bias. This is slightly higher&#13;
than the anti-export bias of 36.5 percent recorded from the trade/payments&#13;
regime alone. The lesson to be drawn from this exercise seems clear: the&#13;
non-trade interventions considered do have a significant influence on the&#13;
incentives for trade, but because they work in opposite directions to roughly&#13;
equal degree, their inclusion in the analysis does little to alter the massive&#13;
anti-export bias implicit in the trade/payments regime.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

D. Qualifications&#13;
128.      The above diagnosis of bias in the incentive regime against exports&#13;
is subject to some qualifications.&#13;
129.      First, the quantitative elements of the discussion have been limited,&#13;
almost exclusively, to the "price variables." The effects of import and export&#13;
licensing have been neglected; their inclusion would accentuate the degree of&#13;
anti-export bias diagnosed. The premia associated with import QRs have already&#13;
been discussed. In addition, interventions through QRs tend to increase the&#13;
uncertainty and variance surrounding the trade regime, which takes an addi-&#13;
tional toll. on efficient resource allocation. To take examples from the export&#13;
side, the sporadic recourse to export bans (within the framework of private&#13;
export licensing) raises the effective tax on exports beyond that captured&#13;
by explicit duties, subsidies and surcharges. Table 19 records the frequency&#13;
of export bans in 1974 on some privately exported items in which Sudan is&#13;
believed to have good, long-term export prospects.&#13;
130.      Second, but on the other side, we must recognize the possibility&#13;
that some Sudanese exports face price-inelastic demand, a situation which&#13;
would justify optimum export taxes. If that is the case it is then illegi-&#13;
timate to count these export duties as part of the total package of taxes&#13;
which discourage exports. So to the extent our estimates of anti-export&#13;
bias include such optimum duties, these are overestimates.&#13;
131.      Third, we must note that some import duties are collected on items&#13;
which, given Sudan's resource base, are unlikely to be produced domestically&#13;
for a long time to come. Consequently, the tariffs should be regarded essen-&#13;
tially as revenue instruments, whose allocative effects are in practice (if&#13;

not theoretically) small.   Hence the inclusion of these import taxes in the&#13;
aggregate measures of bias overstates the bias in favor of import substitution&#13;
and against exports.&#13;
132.      Fourth, for some products, notably those in industry, the existing&#13;
incentives tor import substitution are moderated by the system of project&#13;
licensing and ex-factory price control (recall Section III). These policies&#13;
prevent the existing bias from having its full distorting effects on resource&#13;
allocation. But this last point raises the fundamental question: why retain&#13;
an incentive system whose resource allocation signals have to be constantly&#13;
monitored, controlled and often counteracted? This question is considered&#13;
in the next sub-section.&#13;
133.      But before doing that we offer an overall assessment of the above&#13;
four qualifications. The first points to underestimation of anti-export&#13;
bias, while the other three suggest overestimation. Taken together, they&#13;
probably indicate that we have overestimated anti-export bias in the incen-&#13;
tive regime. BuL, given the massive degrees of anti-export bias shown by&#13;
our numbers, even large allowances for overestimation will not vitiate the&#13;
central diagnosis:   the incentive regime for foreign trade in Sudan is heavily&#13;
biased against exports, even though the long-term development potential of&#13;
the economy is almost certainly tied to their rapid growth.&#13;
E. Revenue Considerations&#13;
134.      The single most important consideration behind this anti-export&#13;
incentive regime is the need to raise government revenue. Historically, for-&#13;
eign trade has been easy to tax, especially in a huge country where communi-&#13;
cations have been poor, qualified accountants scarce, and where neither&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
tradition nor legislation has provided encouragement for careful accounting.&#13;
To this day, Sudan retains its legacy of a revenue system based on indirect&#13;
taxes, and in which commodity taxes on foreign trade occupy a special posi-&#13;
tion. Only in the past decade, with the growth of domestic manufacturing,&#13;
have the protective effects of the tariff structure been recognized and appre-&#13;
ciated; even now much of the deliberate protection offered to local firms is&#13;
done through import quotas and bans, rather than tariffs, whose primary tar-&#13;
get continues to be revenue.&#13;
135.      Whatever the explicit objective of the trade tax structure, the&#13;
distortionary resource allocation incentives exist, and their signalling power&#13;
is likely to exert increasing influence as the economy develops and matures.&#13;
The need to initiate reform is clear and present. But we recognize that this&#13;
will be a slow process; recommendations to reduce or eliminate import tariffs&#13;
and export duties quickly are, by themselves, too facile and unrealistic.&#13;
The trade tax regime can only be rationalized in conjunction with a con-&#13;
certed effort at tax reform, which seeks to replace the existing, allocation-&#13;
distorting revenue instruments with a tax structure that is more allocation-&#13;
neutral. Without deliberate efforts at reform, we have reasons to fear that&#13;
pressures to raise revenue will lead to grasping of easily administered com-&#13;
modity tax handles, with little appreciation of their resource-allocation&#13;
effects. The pressures to increase the effective collection of ushur (local&#13;
tax) from tradeable crops are an obvious example. In Section VIII we outline&#13;
elements of a more trade-neutral tax structure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
F. Is the Exchange-Rate Overvalued?&#13;
136.      Discussions of trade policy frequently dwell on this question.     We&#13;
have already covered many of the substantive points which would normally be&#13;
addressed in such an analysis. And certainly in one obvious sense the Sudanese&#13;
pound is overvalued: open current account deficits would increase dramatically&#13;
if the current panoply of trade taxes, QRs and exchange controls were dis-&#13;
mantled. 1/ But instead of the sub-title above, we prefer to pose the ques-&#13;
tion as: What are the possible benefits for Sudanese trade policy of an&#13;
effective and uniform devaluation? 2/ Posed in this way, there is less danger&#13;
of viewing-devaluation as a panacea for trade policy.&#13;
137.      The principal possible benefits from an effective devaluation in&#13;
Sudan, considered by itself, are:&#13;
(a) if the present structure of trade taxes is to be retained,&#13;
or only slowly reformed, devaluation is the most fiscally&#13;
cheap method for increasing the inducements for export;&#13;
(b)  the nominal base of the existing trade taxes will increase,&#13;
thus increasing government revenue (expenditures would&#13;
also increase, but less);&#13;
1/   This would be true even if strict capital account exchange controls&#13;
were retained.&#13;
2/   We choose this wording to indicate, on the one hand, the possibilities&#13;
for effective (but not de lure) devaluation through increasing the&#13;
Exchange Tax/Subsidy percentage, and on the other, to point out that&#13;
the last such effective devaluation was not uniform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
(c) since devaluation would lead to a higher landed cost&#13;
(tariff-inclusive), in pounds, for imports, this would&#13;
imply a reduction in the QR-induced premia (the Pm),&#13;
which currently accrue to traders and other QR allo-&#13;
cation beneficiaries. In effect, there would be more&#13;
price rationing of imports, with the government col-&#13;
lecting a larger share of the rent element above c.i.f.&#13;
cost.&#13;
138.      But what devaluation would not accomplish is a significant reduc-&#13;
tion in the anti-export bias of the present incentive regime (some reduc-&#13;
tion might occur through the "mopping up" of some of the QR-induced premia).&#13;
This is an obvious corollary of the fact that devaluation entails a uniform&#13;
import tariff and a uniform export subsidy. Thus a key problem diagnosed&#13;
here would remain. Devaluation, though helpful in several respects, is no&#13;
substitute for fiscal reform. The need for a joint policy package is dis-&#13;
cussed further in Section VIII.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
VII. Experience with-Direct Controls&#13;
139.      The different kinds of government policy intervention that we have&#13;
discussed can be usefully subdivided into two groups:&#13;
-    those interventions which, in some sense, work "through the&#13;
market", such as taxes, subsidies, and exchange rate changes;&#13;
and&#13;
-    those direct controls on quantities and prices which, in a&#13;
sense, work by prohibiting certain kinds of market trans-&#13;
actions. 1/&#13;
Economic theory tends to favor the first kind of intervention and frown upon&#13;
the second. Here we try to pull together from our earlier discussions our&#13;
perception of the Sudanese experience with direct controls. The main types&#13;
of direct controls we consider are:&#13;
(a) foreign trade licensing/foreign exchange allocation;&#13;
(b) industrial licensing; and&#13;
(c) domestic price control policies.&#13;
We discuss each briefly.&#13;
A. Foreign Trade Licensin&amp;&#13;
140.      The system of import licensing and exchange control has certainly&#13;
achieved its primary objective of controlling aggregate foreign exchange&#13;
expenditure and keeping reserve loss below what would otherwise have occurred.&#13;
Furthermore, from the viewpoint of authorities, aggregate foreign exchange&#13;
1/   Both sets of actions alter the terms of exchange in the markets in which&#13;
they are applied (hence our inclusion of both under the rubric of "incen-&#13;
tive policies").&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
expenditure has been controlled with greater certainty than is likely to have&#13;
been possible in a freer system.&#13;
141.      But the costs of the system have been high:&#13;
(a) The QR-induced premia above landed cost have aggravated the anti-&#13;
export bias implicit in the structure of foreign trade taxes&#13;
(Section VI).&#13;
(b) The QR-system has been characterized by considerable uncertainty:&#13;
foreign exchange is sometimes simply not available for normally&#13;
approved purchases. This has hindered domestic capacity utili-&#13;
zation and induced holding of large inventories.&#13;
(c) Because of the allocation procedure the same product has often been&#13;
associated with different implicit premia, depending on the final&#13;
recipient and the method of allocation. So the system has not been&#13;
characterized by "horizontal equity."&#13;
(d) Import licenses are rarely allocated among units according to eco-&#13;
nomic criteria; for example, successful domestic manufacturing ven-&#13;
tures may go short, while losing enterprises obtain allocations&#13;
(Section III). Furthermore, the allocation system for domestic&#13;
manufacturing has encouraged the creation of excess capacity&#13;
(Section III).&#13;
(e) Protection of domestic manufacturing by bans or quotas on competing&#13;
imports has encouraged the production of low quality domestic sub-&#13;
stitutes. Quality is not readily subject to policing by ex-factory&#13;
price controls.&#13;
(f) The system has generated high profits for commerce, a sector which&#13;
scarcely needs further profit inducements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
All of these adverse consequences would be alleviated to some degree if there&#13;
were more price rationing of foreign exchange (see Section VIII below).&#13;
142.      Export licensing has been characterized by far fewer quantitative&#13;
restrictions. But over 1974 export bans were frequently used on oilcakes,&#13;
livestock products and dura to improve domestic supply (Section VI). It is&#13;
possible that these interventions were peculiar to the recent period of&#13;
turbulent international commodity markets, but, if they become a permanent&#13;
feature of the scene, there is cause for alarm. These sporadic interventions&#13;
reduce the profit horizon of potential exporters and are a significant non-&#13;
price discouragement to exports.&#13;
B. Industrial Licensing&#13;
143.      Given the heavy protection of domestic industry explicit and impli-&#13;
cit in the foreign trade regime, the efforts at industrial licensing have been&#13;
neccessary and, Dn the whole, beneficial. But rigidities in the system have&#13;
hampered the exploitation of domestic capacity. And, particularly in the&#13;
earlier years, the lack of selectivity in project criteria permitted approval&#13;
of plants producing high-cost, intermediate-import-based import substitutes.&#13;
The effective protection granted to different approved industries has been&#13;
widely divergent, and with no apparent basis in deliberate policy. If the&#13;
pace of industrialization quickens, the opportunities for error in resource&#13;
allocation will multiply. It will become more urgent to institute better&#13;
project selection procedures or to move to a less haphazard protection&#13;
system (Section VIII below).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
C. Domestic Price Control Policies&#13;
144.      Our overall impression is that the Government has been moderately&#13;
successful in fixing two kinds of prices: prices at the factory level (ex-&#13;
factory prices for industrial products and into-mill prices for some agri-&#13;
cultural products) and the retail prices of commodities over whose supply&#13;
the Government exercises direct control (through import monopolies, namely&#13;
sugar and wheat flour. For the other products and distribution stages, price&#13;
control exists largely in name.&#13;
145.      Let us first consider the implications of successful price control.&#13;
As we saw in Section III, the main benefit of ex-factory control was that it&#13;
usually reduced the degree to which domestic firms could exploit the pro-&#13;
tection implicit in the trade and fiscal systems. But this degree was not&#13;
uniform. Much of the initiative (and hence the de facto protection enjoyed)&#13;
lay with the costing procedures of the firms. So the system certainly did&#13;
not reduce the multiplicity of effective protection within the industrial&#13;
sector.&#13;
146.      The other example of relative success, the retail price controls&#13;
on sugar and wheat, certainly achieve the government's proximate goals in&#13;
each case: the levying of a consumption tax in the case of sugar (in all&#13;
normal years) 1/ and a consumption subsidy in the case of wheat. But the&#13;
proximate goals are achieved at the cost of implicit production taxes on&#13;
domestic wheat and sugarcane (Section IV). Such production taxation will&#13;
have to be reduced if Sudan is to fulfill her plans to become a significant&#13;
1/   In 1974 the government's fixed price policy on sugar required a con-&#13;
sumption subsidy as world prices boomed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
exporter of both commodities.   If the proximate objectives are to be retained,&#13;
then the government may have to consider operating a two-tier price system for&#13;
both products: a fixed producer price for domestic procurement and a world&#13;
market-determined price for exports. Such a two-tier system has operated for&#13;
some years for cottonseed.&#13;
147.      Where government price contol is weak, which is true for most pro-&#13;
ducts at wholesale and retail stages, the commerce sector is the beneficiary&#13;
(Section V). And here we would argue that the government's panoply of price&#13;
control measures may have an adverse consequence, not simply because it fails,&#13;
but because by fostering an illusion of control it distracts attention from&#13;
the rich premia being earned in trade. This, in turn, means that policy-&#13;
makers underestimate the inequity and resource misallocation costs associated&#13;
with the heavily QR-protected economy. It might be better to abolish the&#13;
pretense at price and profit margin control over wide areas where, in effect,&#13;
it does not exist.&#13;
148.      The analytical basis for the general profit margin controls is, in&#13;
any case, weak. The rules are based on some notion of a "fair profit". But&#13;
such a notion subverts the role of profits as an allocative guide. And as for&#13;
equity, a revamped direct tax mechanism would generally accomplish better re-&#13;
sults than the present weakly applied price control measures.&#13;
149.      Finally, we must draw attention to a common feature of all these&#13;
direct controls, discussed above. They require detailed and continuous inter-&#13;
vention. To be successful, such detailed management of an economy requires,&#13;
at a minimum, a well elaborated plan, a pervasive and rapid information-&#13;
monitoring system and a coordinated decision-making process. None of these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
conditions is met to any significant degree by the present administrative&#13;
structure in Sudan. It therefore makes sense to seek policy modes which&#13;
require less detailed administrative action and to shift more of the eco-&#13;
nomic coordination burden to market processes. Most of our suggestions for&#13;
policy reform (Section VIII) take account of this view.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -&#13;
VIII. An Agenda for Policy Reform&#13;
A. Incentive Policies and Development Strategy&#13;
150.      Our suggestions for policy reform follow from the diagnoses, con-&#13;
ducted in the previous sections, of the adverse implications of the present&#13;
policy regime. Like the diagnoses, our suggestions are limited to the domain&#13;
of incentive policies. We fully recognize that much of the growth in the&#13;
Sudanese economy in the next decade will follow from the heavy, foreign-&#13;
financed investments anticipated in the productive sectors. Certainly,&#13;
policies are no substitute for projects. But the structure of policy can&#13;
enhance or reduce project benefits and the larger the anticipated investment&#13;
program the greater the potential losses from wrong policies.&#13;
151.      Our view on the part to be played by incentive policies is also&#13;
conditioned by our notions about the appropriate development strategy. In&#13;
very broad terms, "agricultural exports" sums up this strategy. Given Sudan's&#13;
underexploited resources of arable land, livestock and water, and the rela-&#13;
tively small size of the domestic market, it would be difficult to disagree&#13;
with this conventional wisdom. In somewhat less general terms we see the&#13;
strategy as composed of the following elements:&#13;
(a) Development of the "modern agricultural sector", composed of irri-&#13;
gated and mechanized rain-fed modes, through foreign and domestic&#13;
private resources. This would be the productive lynchpin of the&#13;
economy;&#13;
(b) The development of public expenditure policy to raise producti-&#13;
vity in traditional agriculture. This would be the main arm of&#13;
equity policy in Sudan;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
(c) Selective, and limited, industrialization based on agro-processing,&#13;
with a view to gradually developing export capability;&#13;
(d) The use of foreign and domestic public investment to expand the&#13;
infrastructure to facilitate the above elements of the development&#13;
strategy.&#13;
We anchor our suggestions for policy reforms to this sketch of development&#13;
strategy. Clearly, the structure of incentives should be designed to sti-&#13;
mulate the modern agricultural sector, to encourage traditional farmers to&#13;
enjoy returns fro&amp; the cash economy while complementary public expenditure&#13;
raises their productivity, and to prevent the expansion of the industrial&#13;
sector from extracting a heavy tax on agriculture. Basically, the role of&#13;
incentive policies should be to assist exploitation of comparative advan-&#13;
tage, while public expenditure policy (and to a more limited degree, taxation)&#13;
focuses on equity objectives.&#13;
B. The Policy Package: An Outline&#13;
152.      With such a development strategy in mind we draw upon our earlier&#13;
analytical appraisal of policies to outline the proximate goals that policy&#13;
reforms should aim at. The reforms should:&#13;
(a) Reduce the intersectoral resource allocation bias against agricul-&#13;
ture, which is implicit in the present structure of policy&#13;
(Section V);&#13;
(b) Reduce the heavy anti-export bias diagnosed in Section VI:&#13;
(c) Reduce the multiplicity of effective protection rates within the&#13;
industrial sector (Section III);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -&#13;
(d) Increase the flexibility of resource allocation within alternative&#13;
agricultural activities to take better advantage of changing&#13;
international trade opportunities -(Section IV);&#13;
(e) Reduce the burden of detailed economic management currently borne&#13;
by the administrative structure (Section VII); and&#13;
(f) Reduce the profitability of the commerce sector (Section V).&#13;
154.      To implement these goals we outline the following medium-term&#13;
program of policy reforms:&#13;
1. Foreign Trade/Payments Policies&#13;
(a) Reduce reliance on export duties;&#13;
(b) Increase the rate of Exchange Tax/Subsidy from 15 to&#13;
30-35 percent, to apply uniformly to all transactions;&#13;
(c) Exempt exports from Develpoment Tax (or any other sim-&#13;
ilar flat sales tax) 1/;&#13;
(d) Integrate import duty structure with domestic excise&#13;
system (see (2a) and the discussion in the next sub-&#13;
section);&#13;
(e) Reduce recourse to export bans.&#13;
2. Domestic Fiscal Policies&#13;
(a) Integrate domestic excise structure with import duty&#13;
structure (see (Id) and below);&#13;
(b) Develop income taxation for the modern agricultural&#13;
sector; and&#13;
1/   The present policy of exempting industrial exports from domestic excises&#13;
should be retained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -&#13;
(c) Move from commodity-based taxes like ushur to land&#13;
taxation for local revenues.&#13;
(3) Intra-Sector Policies: Industry&#13;
(a) Much less use of QRs for protective purposes. If&#13;
protection is deemed necessary, it should be through&#13;
the tariff system and at a uniform rate for all&#13;
products;&#13;
(b) Introduce more rigorous project criteria for indust-&#13;
rial licensing;&#13;
(c) Much more selectivity in granting fiscal concessions,&#13;
especially import duty exemptions on raw materials;&#13;
and&#13;
(d) More recourse to economic criteria in allocating&#13;
foreign exchange.&#13;
(4) Intra-Sector Policies: Agriculture&#13;
(a) Institute a new Price Unit which would coordinate&#13;
all analysis and advice on domestic agricultural&#13;
output price policies, and pay much more attention&#13;
to international relative price norms; and&#13;
(b) Require agricultural parastatals to be flexible in&#13;
determining annual cropping patterns.&#13;
C. The Policy Package: A Discussion&#13;
154.      We should make two general points before proceeding to a brief dis-&#13;
cussion of particulars. First, though ideally the package should be seen as a&#13;
whole, we believe that instituting individual elements will also move in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
direction of a more rational incentive framework. Second, we have abjured all&#13;
discussions of timing and phasing at this stage. Our proposals relate to the&#13;
medium and long run. Their implementation will obviously have to take account&#13;
of short run exigencies. In general, the sooner these proposals are imple-&#13;
mented the sooner an improved structure of incentives will be achieved.&#13;
Foreign Trade/Payments Policies&#13;
155.      Items (la), (1c) and (le) are designed to accomplish two things at&#13;
the same time: first, they would reduce the anti-export bias in the present&#13;
trade regime, and second, since virtually all exports are agricultural prod-&#13;
ucts, this would simultaneously reduce the effective taxation of the agricul-&#13;
tural sector. The recommended increase in the Exchange Tax/Subsidy rate would&#13;
amount to a de facto devaluation of 15-20 percent. We have already reviewed&#13;
the benefits of such action in Section VI. Basically, the policy would have&#13;
two beneficial effects: it would increase the incentive for exports (and&#13;
remittances), and increase the degree of price rationing of foreign exchange&#13;
amongst domestic uses. The latter will mean lower QR-induced premia which,&#13;
in turn, will mean a lower degree of anti-export bias, lower profits for&#13;
domestic trade and reduced costs associated with the multiplicity and var-&#13;
iance of signals in a QR regime.&#13;
Tariffs, Excise Taxation and Protection&#13;
156.      We consider recommendations (ld), (2a) and (3a) together.    We&#13;
analyzed in earlier sections how the existing import duties are important&#13;
ingredients of the bias against exports and against agriculture. But, given&#13;
their crucial revenue function, we noted (Section VI) that recommendations to&#13;
reduce tariffs are, by themselves, facile and impractical. What is needed&#13;
is a revenue structure which is more neutral both with regard to exports vs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
import substitution and with respect to agriculture vs. industry. To this&#13;
end we propose gradual integration of the domestic excise structure with&#13;
the import duty structure. As we noted in Sections III and IV, the effect&#13;
of a domestic excise at a comparable rate to the import duty on a final&#13;
product is to offset the protection offered by the import duty. Thus, even&#13;
though the import duty structure is left unchanged, the creation of a parallel&#13;
domestic excise rate structure on final commodities offsets the distorting&#13;
protection effects. 1/&#13;
157.      If it is believed that domestic production for the home market&#13;
should receive some protection, this can be introduced quite simply. If T&#13;
is the rate of import duty on the final product under consideration, the&#13;
domestic excise can be set at (T-X), where X is the element of protection&#13;
desired. We do recommend that protection, if it must be given, be granted&#13;
in this manner through the tariff/tax system, and not by QRs. Further we&#13;
recommend that X be set equal for all products, so that the degree of pro-&#13;
tection is uniform (we also recommend that X be kept low, no higher than&#13;
20 percent). And since we are interested in equal effective protection,&#13;
X can also be the common rate of import duty on intermediate goods. 2/&#13;
1/   We do not mean to imply that there is no scope for rationalizing the&#13;
import duty structure. But we do feel that any such rationalization&#13;
must be subject to two constraints:&#13;
-    the rationalization must not lead to sharp reductions in overall&#13;
import duty revenue; and&#13;
-    tax rates under the new structure must be sufficiently flexible&#13;
to permit heavy taxation of consumer luxuries and low rates on&#13;
basic consumer goods and intermediate items.&#13;
2/   Our proposals here offer a broad approach; implementation will require&#13;
more detailed analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103 -&#13;
158.      The desirable characteristics of our proposal to integrate the&#13;
domestic excise and import duty structures 1/- are:&#13;
(a)  the bias-in favor of import substitution (and against&#13;
exports) will be sharply reduced;&#13;
(b) since the present structure of tariffs accords heavy&#13;
protection to manufacturing activities and little to&#13;
agriculture, neutralization of the tariff protection&#13;
by excise taxation will cut down the bias in-incentives&#13;
in favor of manufacturing and against agriculture;&#13;
(c) all this will be achieved without sacrificing the reve-&#13;
nue function of import duties;&#13;
(d) the above neutralization of protective signals will&#13;
reduce the onus on the industrial licensing system to&#13;
weed out the "wrong" projects;&#13;
(e) the emphasis on protection through tariffs, rather than&#13;
QRs, will mitigate the poor-quality-encouraging aspects&#13;
of the latter method; and&#13;
(f) though the element of protection conferred can be uniform&#13;
across commodities, our proposal permits differentiation&#13;
of the import and excise duty structure across commodi-&#13;
ties to aid equity goals.&#13;
1/   It may be objected that for many commodities the domestic excise will&#13;
be redundant, since these products are not produced in Sudan. This&#13;
argument doesn't go far. After all, the whole purpose of the proposal&#13;
is to reduce incentives to produce items in which Sudan does not have&#13;
a cost advantage. It is far better to reform the incentive structure&#13;
before a whole-new generation of high-cost, import-substituting indus-&#13;
tries have grown up behind the protective barrier.&#13;

Other Domestic Fiscal Policies&#13;
159.      (2b) is aimed at replacing the revenues that will be lost if our&#13;
recommendation for abolishing export duties and other charges on exports are&#13;
accepted. Clearly, if modern agriculture is to form the basis for future&#13;
growth, means will have to be devised for appropriating some of the incomes&#13;
generated in this sector for public purposes. We recognize this. Our con-&#13;
cern is to ensure that the taxation method does not distort resource alloca-&#13;
tion, in the way export duties clearly do. Nor do we believe income taxation&#13;
of the modern agriculture sector to be insuperably difficult. In rainfed&#13;
mechanized agriculture only a few thousand farms will be involved. And the&#13;
number of irrigated tenancies subject to tax may not be large with a rea-&#13;
sonable exemption limit.&#13;
Other Intra-Sector Policies&#13;
160.      The need for reforms (3a), (3b) and (3c) for industry is self-evi-&#13;
dent. The case for proposals (4a) and (4b) for Agriculture has been argued&#13;
earlier in the paper. With regard to them we would like to emphasize that&#13;
one of the major advantages of crop activities is that factor allocation&#13;
decisions are quickly reversible, unlike the "non-shiftable capital stock"&#13;
problems associated with industrial activities. This technological flexi-&#13;
bility emphasizes both the scope and the need for exploiting short-term com-&#13;
parative advantage.&#13;
161.      We believe that, if the reforms suggested above are implemented,&#13;
the new structure of incentives will substantially improve the efficiency of&#13;
resource allocation in Sudan and will facilitate the kind of agricultural-&#13;
export-based development strategy that we discussed earlier.&#13;

            Incentives for resource allocation : a case
            study of Sudan
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The paper examines the role of a wide
            range of policy interventions -- such as taxes and subsidies
            on international transactions, exchange rates, import
            licensing/foreign exchange allocation, export licensing and
            marketing schemes, domestic excise taxes and price controls
            -- in determining the overall incentive framework
            influencing the allocation of resources in Sudan in the
            mid-1970s. The paper concludes that the incentive framework
            confers widely divergent rates of effective protection to
            different industrial and agricultural activities; that
            overall the incentive framework is biased against
            agriculture and in favor of industry; and that it is biased
            in favor of import substitution and against exports. The
            paper concludes with a set of policy suggestions for
            reforming the incentive framework to be more in line with
            the underlying comparative advantage of the Sudanese economy.
