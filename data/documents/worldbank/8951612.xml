 Note 1-Organization&#13;
&#13;

 on October 14, 1966 to provide facilities for the conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes&#13;
 between States andnationals of other States,On February 13, 1967,the International Bankfor Re-&#13;
 construction and Development (the Bank) and the Centre entered into Administrative Arrange-&#13;
 ments which were effective as of the date of the establishment of the Centre.The Memorandum of&#13;
 Administrative Arrangements (the Memorandum) provides that, except to the extent that the Cen-&#13;
 tre may b e reimbursed by the parties to proceedings for fees and expenses of members of Con-&#13;
 ciliation Commissions,Arbitral Tribunals or ad hoc Committees, the Bank shall provide facilities&#13;
 and services to the Centre, as described inNotes 2 and 3.&#13;
&#13;
Note 2-Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies&#13;
&#13;
     Basis ofAccounting and Financial StatementPresentation;The financial statements have been&#13;
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of&#13;
America and with InternationalAccounting Standards. Such financial statements are presented in&#13;
accordance with Statement ofFinancialAccounting Standard No. 117,"Financial StatementsoflVot-&#13;
For-Profit-Organizations" (SFAS No. 117). SFAS No. 117 requires that net assets are classified in&#13;
accordance with donor restrictions;however,there are nonet assets as ofJune 30,2001and 2000.&#13;
&#13;
     Use of Estimates:The preparation of financial statements inconformity with accounting prin-&#13;
ciples generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make esti-&#13;
mates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of&#13;
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts&#13;
of the revenues and expenses duringthe reportingperiod.Actual results could differ from these&#13;
estimates.&#13;
&#13;
     CashEquivalents; The Centre considers all highlyliquiddebt investments purchased with an&#13;
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.&#13;
&#13;
     Valueofservicesprovided by theBank and in-kind contributions:Inaccordance with Statement&#13;
of FinancialAccounting Standard No. 116, "Accounting for Contributions Received and Contribu-&#13;
tionsMade", the value of services provided bythe Bank is determinedbythe estimated fair value&#13;
of these services and is recordedbythe Centre as in-lundcontributions and also as expenses of&#13;
the Centre.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                                                                     31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Annex 3 (continued)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         The Bank provides support services and facilities to the Centre includingthe following:&#13;
&#13;
         (1) the services of staff members and consultants; and&#13;
         (2) other administrative services andfacilities, such as travel, communications,office accom-&#13;
    modations, furniture, equipment, supplies and printing.&#13;
&#13;
         Revenue recognition from arbitrationproceedings: The Centre does not have resources of its&#13;
    own. The Centre's direct expenses attributable to arbitration proceedings are borne by the par-&#13;
    ties inaccordancewiththe Centre'sAdministrative and FinancialRegulations (Regulations).Inac-&#13;
    cordance with these Regulations, the Secretary-General calls on the parties to make advance&#13;
I   deposits with the Centre from time to time to defray these anticipated expenses.Accordingly, the&#13;
    Centre recognizes revenues from these exchange transactions during the period of and to the&#13;
    extent of expenses incurred related to arbitration proceedings.If,after the completion of an arbi-&#13;
    tration proceeding, it is determined that there is a cash surplus,such surplus shall be refunded to&#13;
    the parties inproportion to the amounts advanced by each party to the Centre.&#13;

&#13;
To International Centre for Settlement&#13;
     of Investment Disputes&#13;
&#13;
We have audited the accompanying statements of financial position of the International Centre for&#13;
Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre) as ofJune 30,2001and 2000, andthe relatedstate-&#13;
ments of activities and cash flows for the years then ended.These financial statements are the re-&#13;
sponsibility ofthe management of the International Bankfor Reconstruction andDevelopment and&#13;
ofthe Centre.Our responsibility is to express an opinion onthe financial statements based on our&#13;
audits.&#13;
&#13;
We conducted our audits inaccordance with auditingstandards generally accepted inthe United&#13;
States ofAmerica and with the International Standards onAuditing. Those standards require that&#13;
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial state-&#13;
ments are free of materialmisstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence&#13;
supportingthe amounts anddisclosures inthe financial statements.An audit also includes assess-&#13;
ingthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as&#13;
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.We believe that our audits provide a rea-&#13;
sonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
&#13;
Inour opinion, such financial statementspresent fairly, inall materialrespects,the financial posi-&#13;
tion ofthe International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes as ofJune 30,2001 and2000,&#13;
and the change in its net assets and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with ac-&#13;
countingprinciples generally acceptedinthe UnitedStates ofAmerica andwith InternationalAc-&#13;

            International Center Settlement
            Investment Disputes (ICSID) issues its decisions regarding
            place of arbitration, bifurcation of proceedings, production
            of documents, schedule of pleadings and procedure for the
            submission of evidence. The caseload of the Centre continued
            to grow at its record pace of 12 new arbitration cases
            registered during the year. The number of ICSID awards
            rendered during the year reached a new record number of
            nine. While it had undertaken to administer the Southern
            Bluefin Tuna Case in the previous fiscal year, this year saw
            the conclusion of that case by an award rendered on August
            4, 2000, in which the tribunal declined jurisdiction.
            ICSID's publications have continued to appear
            regularly. ICSID is continuing to reap the benefits of
            Ibrahim F. I. Shihata's many efforts. The ICSID
            newsletter provided information on activities of the Centre
            and on disputes pending before ICSID, as well as articles on
            topics of current interest.  The ICSID review published
            materials on domestic and international law relating to
            foreign investment and investment dispute settlement.
