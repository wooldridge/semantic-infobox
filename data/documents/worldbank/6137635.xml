COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE FOR LOCAL CAPACITY IN CENTRAL ASIA:&#13;
The Community Empowerment Network&#13;

&#13;
        In 2002 the World Bank Institute and Europe and Central Asia Region (ECA) launched the&#13;
      Community Empowerment Network (CEN): four national networks linked through regional activities&#13;
      that would build the capacity of communities and development partners to implement community-dri-&#13;
      ven development (CDD) projects. CEN has to date had clear successes as well as difficulties--particu-&#13;
      larly in linkage to World Bank operations and improving local coordination with multiple donors.&#13;
      CEN's experience points to specific lessons that could be applied in creating other communities of prac-&#13;
      tice, for example, emphasizing peer review among countries and establishing clear indicators of&#13;
      progress as well as a number of specific administrative lessons.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
  The World Bank has invested millions of dollars in         (ECSSD) launched the CEN in late 2002 as a commu-&#13;

organizational performance. This is based on a belief&#13;
in the value of "situational" or "social" learning:          CEN: A Tool for Scaling up CDD&#13;
&#13;
learning that takes place through informal interaction         "Community-driven development" (CDD) is a term&#13;
with other professionals. Such learning is facilitated       used to describe projects that encourage local commu-&#13;
through informal groups of professionals who have a          nities to control the direction of their own develop-&#13;
real need to know what each other knows. Often               ment from project conception through implementation&#13;
referred to as "communities of practice," these groups       and evaluation. Such projects are seen as a way of&#13;
allow practitioners to find out what works, what does        filling gaps in local service delivery and ensuring&#13;

  The World Bank has used this approach internally           poor. Recognizing that projects promoting CDD often&#13;

            Communities of practice for local capacity
            in Central Asia: the community empowerment network
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In 2002 the World Bank Institute and
            Europe and Central Asia Region (ECA) launched the Community
            Empowerment Network (CEN): four national networks linked
            through regional activities that would build the capacity of
            communities and development partners to implement
            community-driven development (CDD) projects. CEN has to date
            had clear successes as well as difficulties-particularly in
            linkage to World Bank operations and improving local
            coordination with multiple donors. CEN's experience
            points to specific lessons that could be applied in creating
            other communities of practice, for example, emphasizing peer
            review among countries and establishing clear indicators of
            progress as well as a number of specific administrative lessons.
