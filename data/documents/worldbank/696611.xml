ORISSA POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. INDIA'S POWER SECTOR&#13;
1.1   All across India the quality of the electricity supply is poor. Power shortages are&#13;
estimated at about 10 percent of total electrical energy and 20 percent of peak capacity&#13;
requirements. Plant availability and efficiency are generally low and there are high system losses&#13;
throughout India's transmission and distribution networks. The financial performance of the&#13;
sector as a whole is also unsatisfactory, with low returns and no contribution to investment from&#13;
internal resources. Commercial losses of the State Electricity Boards (SEBs) furthermore, are&#13;
rising. They reached the equivalent of about US$2.2 billion in fiscal 1996, or about 0.8 percent of&#13;
India's GDP.&#13;
1.2   Inefficiencies in India's power sector are largely due to the SEBs' lack of managerial and&#13;
commercial autonomy. Although the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948 nominally grants the&#13;
boards considerable freedom of operation, in practice the states have regarded them as extensions&#13;
of government and have exerted influence over their tariff, operational, and investment decisions&#13;
to further political objectives. As a consequence, SEBs generally have an inadequate capital&#13;
structure, low tariffs and poor bill collection, yet are required to undertake unremunerative&#13;
activities on behalf of the state governments without proper compensation. The Government of&#13;
India has now recognized that increased emphasis needs to be placed on improving the efficiency&#13;
of supply, consumption, and pricing of electricity and that this can only be achieved by reforming&#13;
power sector management and financing at the state level. The organization and regulation of the&#13;
power sector is discussed below. An overview of the power sector, including electricity&#13;
consumption, tariffs and supply, is given in Annex 1. I&#13;
Organization and Regulation&#13;
1.3   Responsibility for the electricity supply in India is shared constitutionally between the&#13;
central government and the states. The Electricity Act of 1910 provided the initial legal&#13;
framework that still today governs the operations of licensees, that is, the existing private utilities.&#13;
As amended, the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948 provides the overall regulatory framework for&#13;
the sector, charging the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) with developing a national power&#13;
policy and with planning, coordinating, and regulating sector development. The 1948 Act also&#13;
empowers the central government (currently the Ministry of Power) to make rules for carrying&#13;
out CEA's objectives by means of notification in the Official Gazette. The 1948 Act created the&#13;
SEBs and entrusted them with primary responsibility for public power supply as well as for&#13;
related state-level regulation. The boards were envisioned as largely self-governing entities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
empowered to set tariffs and monitor licensees. But after the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956&#13;
defined the aspects of generation and distribution that were the exclusive responsibility of the&#13;
states, the once-significant role of private utilities gradually diminished. Today, following the&#13;
1991 amendments, it is recognized that various sections of the 1948 and 1910 Acts could be&#13;
modernized, but there are no fundamental legal obstacles preventing private investment from&#13;
entering into the sector.&#13;
Central Sector&#13;
1.4   Since the 1970s, the Government of India has been actively involved in power&#13;
development in India to complement the efforts of the states. The Government owns several&#13;
generating companies (including the National Thermal Power Corporation, NTPC, and the&#13;
National Hydroelectric Power Corporation). NTPC's growth has been remarkable and it now&#13;
accounts for about 30 percent of India's thermal generation (Annex 1.1). The Government also&#13;
owns India's new national transmission company and grid operator, the Power Grid Corporation&#13;
of India (POWERGRID). These utilities were incorporated under the Companies Act.&#13;
1.5   The Ministry of Power (MOP) approves tariff-setting principles for the centrally-owned&#13;
entities. Tariff proposals are reviewed by the Central Electricity Authority which then sends them&#13;
to the MOP for notification. Tariffs are determined on a cost-of-service basis and are subject to&#13;
basic performance standards. The utilities' financial viability is ensured to the extent that their&#13;
tariff revenues cover operational costs, including debt service. The Government of India also&#13;
owns two power sector financial intermediaries, the Power Finance Corporation and the Rural&#13;
Electrification Corporation.&#13;
1.6   The Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources administers the Government's&#13;
renewable energy program, which seeks to meet the decentralized energy needs of rural areas to&#13;
supplement conventional power supply with such alternative energy sources as mini-hydro,&#13;
biomass, wind and solar-power systems. The Government provides budgetary resources for&#13;
demonstration projects and promotes private investment through various fiscal incentives, while&#13;
the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency provides institutional financing.&#13;
State Sector&#13;
1.7   The states own the SEBs and State Generating Companies, which together generate&#13;
almost 70 percent of India's electricity supply and provide most of the distribution to consumers.&#13;
The 1948 Act explicitly requires the SEBs to operate "in the most efficient and economical&#13;
manner" and mandates that they adjust their tariffs to achieve a minimum return, after interest, of&#13;
3 percent on net fixed assets in operation. The Act, however, allows a state to specify a higher&#13;
return target for its SEB than the statutory minimum return. Further, it specifies that interest on&#13;
loans from the state governments is to be paid by the SEBs only after meeting the minimum&#13;
return. States are, in fact, required to provide subsidies to help the SEBs meet the minimum&#13;
return requirement, by compensating the SEBs inter alia for low tariffs to residential consumers&#13;
and for using the SEBs as administratively convenient vehicles for agricultural input subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
1.8   For most SEBs, meeting the statutory 3 percent after-interest return would cover&#13;
operating costs and debt service provided state government subsidies were fully paid on time and&#13;
bill collection were reasonable. Because of their poor operational performance, low tariffs, and&#13;
inadequate subsidies, however, most SEBs do not reach the Act's statutory minimum returns.&#13;
Their aggregate operating losses are in fact rising and have reached alarming levels (Annex 1.1).&#13;
Operating deficits and capital expenditures are presently financed by borrowing or from state&#13;
budgetary resources, greatly burdening state govemment finances across India.&#13;
Private Utilities&#13;
1.9    At independence private utilities and licensed local authorities together provided about 80&#13;
percent of India's public electricity supply. But when their licenses expired, most licensees were&#13;
taken over by the SEBs, in line with the 1956 Industrial Policy Resolution. Today, only five of&#13;
the private utilities originally licensed under the 1910 Electricity Act remain: Bombay Suburban&#13;
Electric Supply (BSES) and Tata Electric Companies (TEC) in Bombay, Ahmedabad Electricity&#13;
Company (AEC), Surat Electric Company, and Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation (CESC) in&#13;
Calcutta.&#13;
1.10   Then in 1991 India reversed its long-standing policy on private investment in the sector.&#13;
Power was removed from the list of activities reserved for the public sector in the Industrial&#13;
Policy Resolution, and the 1948 Act was amended to lift many of the regulatory disincentives to&#13;
private investment in the power sector. These changes were fully consistent with the Government&#13;
of India's objective to tap the financial, technical, and managerial capabilities of the private sector&#13;
in areas previously restricted to the public sector.&#13;
1.11  India now allows full local or foreign private ownership of power companies and offers a&#13;
thirty-year license with the prospect of twenty year renewals and increased financial returns.&#13;
Provision is also made in the 1948 Act for private generating companies and captive plants to sell&#13;
power to the SEBs. Additional incentives were introduced in the Government of India budget for&#13;
fiscal 1994 included reducing the import duty on power projects to 20 percent and offering new&#13;
private power projects a five-year tax holiday. These changes have resulted in remarkable&#13;
business development activity by private developers (para. 1.16).&#13;
Grid Operations&#13;
1.12  Indian utilities are grouped into five regional interconnected power systems in the Eastern,&#13;
Northern, North-Eastern, Southern, and Western regions of India. In 1964 the Government of&#13;
India created Regional Electricity Boards to bring the state boards together with the central and&#13;
joint sector utilities to coordinate system operations in their respective regional grids. It also&#13;
entrusted the Central Electricity Authority with the development and operation of Regional Load&#13;
Dispatch Centers to support the regional boards. In 1991, an amendment of the 1948 Act&#13;
strengthened the authority of the Regional Electricity Boards by requiring generating companies&#13;
and licensees to follow their instructions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
1.13  In 1993, under the POWERGRID System Development Project (Ln. 3577-IN), the central&#13;
government agreed to transfer the Regional Load Dispatch Centers and their operational&#13;
responsibilities from the Central Electricity Authority to POWERGRID. The transfer program&#13;
was implemented on schedule and completed in January 1996. POWERGRID, in cooperation&#13;
with the SEBs and with Bank support, is implementing projects to develop modem coordination&#13;
and control systems for the Northern and Southern regions. It has also prepared similar projects&#13;
for the Eastern, Western, and North-Eastern regions, all expected to go into implementation in the&#13;
course of 1996. A recently-completed study confirmed the need for further improvements in the&#13;
structure of bulk power tariffs, and work on the recommended modifications has began under an&#13;
action plan approved by the central government as agreed under Ln. 3577-IN.&#13;
Power Sector Reform&#13;
1.14  The Government of India recognizes that its economic growth targets will be threatened&#13;
as long as the country's power supply constrains industrial development and the financial losses of&#13;
the power sector remain a burden on the public sector finances. Under the constitutionally&#13;
mandated sharing of responsibilities in the sector, the central government is pursuing a three-&#13;
pronged approach to remedy the root cause of many of the power sector's problems with&#13;
efficiency and resource mobilization. The Government of India imposes financial discipline on the&#13;
SEBs through its central agencies. It also presses the states to adjust their power tariffs and has&#13;
opened the sector to private investment. In addition, the Government of India has undertaken to&#13;
support states willing to reform their power sectors.&#13;
Central Sector Agencies as Agents of Reform&#13;
1.15  In India the states' budgetary allocations are set by an automatic allocation formula,&#13;
making it difficult for the Government of India to condition central assistance to the states.&#13;
Within this overall budgetary and central assistance framework, the Government uses its own&#13;
agencies and the private sector to promote operational and financial improvements in the SEBs:&#13;
* Power Finance Corporation. Supported by the Bank, ADB, ODA and USAID, the&#13;
Power Finance Corporation (PFC) provides resources only to those utilities that have&#13;
committed themselves to improve their performance under time-bound Operational and&#13;
Financial Action Plans endorsed by their state governments and aimed at improving the&#13;
utilities' resource mobilization, operational efficiency, and commercialization. While the&#13;
requirements of these action plans are generally modest, several SEBs and states have&#13;
found them difficult to comply with. As a result, the PFC has had to restrict in its&#13;
operations, and its impact on the state power sector has fallen much below original&#13;
expectations. The PFC is nevertheless promoting minimum improvements (para. 1.20) that&#13;
are immediately required and thereby contributes to India's overall sector reform.&#13;
* New collection and sanction policies. NTPC's and POWERGRID's new investment and&#13;
commercial policies allow NTPC, India's main generating utility, and POWERGRID to&#13;
shut off or restrict power and defer future investment if their clients are in default of their&#13;
bulk supply agreements. These strictures are designed to promote better commercial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
discipline in the SEBs, and also to improve NTPC's and POWERGRID's revenue&#13;
collection and overall operational and financial performance. Since 1994, NTPC and&#13;
POWERGRID have - with considerable determination and success - applied these new&#13;
investment and commercial policies agreed with the Bank under two major 1993 lending&#13;
operations. Providing additional central sector power to performing states and&#13;
withholding it from defaulters is a powerful instrument to promote financial discipline and&#13;
an absolutely necessary (though not by itself a sufficient) incentive for the states to&#13;
undertake sector reform. (For NTPC's and POWERGRID's recent performance, see&#13;
Annex 1.2).&#13;
* POWERGRID. India's power transmission and system operations are going through an&#13;
extensive restructuring program with active Bank support. POWERGRID is being&#13;
developed to improve the efficiency of the transmission sector, encourage private&#13;
generation, and facilitate competition in power generation among both generators and&#13;
their clients. After initial difficulties, POWERGRID's institutional growth has been&#13;
remarkable and its role in India's power sector is now widely accepted and supported.&#13;
POWERGRID has also been able to attract funding to support its ambitious investment&#13;
program to reinforce the power system and develop modem coordination and control&#13;
systems, breaking past patterns of chronic under-investment in transmission and system&#13;
operations. The next set of development challenges are being addressed as a part of the&#13;
preparation of the proposed follow-up Bank operation, POWERGRID II.&#13;
Private Power&#13;
1. 16 In 1991, faced with a growing power gap and diminishing public resources available for&#13;
the sector, the Government of India opened the power sector to private sector participation in&#13;
generation, transmission, and distribution (paras. 1.10-11). These policy changes and high-level&#13;
promotional efforts were successful in encouraging power projects. So far, about 250 proposals&#13;
for adding almost 100,000 MW of capacity have been received. But despite substantial interest,&#13;
exploratory activity, and numerous Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with private&#13;
developers, only a few agreements have been finalized.&#13;
1.17 Most of the MOUs have to be regarded merely as expressions of interest. Some,&#13;
however, give specific sponsors exclusive rights to pursue investors and developers to their&#13;
projects and sites. Eight projects are at an advanced stage, with power purchase agreements&#13;
signed and the extension of counter-guarantees approved by the Government. Only two counter-&#13;
guarantee agreements have so far been finalized. ENRON's Dabhol power project in Maharashtra&#13;
proceeded to financial closure but then became the focus of controversy and continues to receive&#13;
international attention. Project implementation is expected to resume shortly. The lb power&#13;
project of the AES Transpower in Orissa (para. 2.2) was also expected to reach financial closure&#13;
in 1995, but its power purchase agreement was opened for renegotiations in mid-1995 between&#13;
the developer and the state government that took office in Orissa in March 1995. Negotiations&#13;
are expected to be concluded during 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
1.18  Progress in the finalization of various private power projects has been slow, partly because&#13;
of such policy and regulatory issues as the setting up of collection and exchange rate safeguard&#13;
mechanisms and import tax and duty concessions, the cumbersome administrative processes&#13;
involved in securing project clearances, and often insufficient preparatory work to make project&#13;
proposals bankable. Recent changes in state governments have highlighted the political dimension&#13;
of private power development. The fundamental reason for the slow progress is, however, the&#13;
poor financial position of most SEBs.&#13;
1.19  The Government of India has so far resisted pressures to provide all-encompassing&#13;
guarantees and has so far limited its support to pioneer projects in states that meet its basic&#13;
performance criteria, that is, are essentially in compliance with the PFC's Operational and&#13;
Financial Operation Plan conditions. While progress is expected to remain slow, increased&#13;
reliance on the private sector should help to improve financial discipline and promote reform,&#13;
since private investment, in the absence of further central government guarantees, will only go to&#13;
states with an attractive policy environment and a financially sound power sector with&#13;
creditworthy utilities.&#13;
State Power Sector Reform&#13;
1.20  The states' severe power sector problems are attributable to the SEBs poor operational&#13;
efficiency which is largely caused by the state governments' political interference. Immediate&#13;
minimum actions to restore a measure of financial viability would include:&#13;
*  Financial restructuring to establish a reasonable debt equity structure and satisfactory&#13;
financial objectives (including an increase in internal cash generation to make a reasonable&#13;
contribution to future investment) for the SEBs.&#13;
*  Tariff adjustments to meet these revised financial objectives.&#13;
#  Improvements in metering, billing and collection - and in payments to and enforcement by&#13;
the central utilities.&#13;
*  Shifting investment away from supply expansion (new generation) to focus on efficiency&#13;
(plant and power system rehabilitation and reinforcement).&#13;
*  Contracting private companies or NTPC to rehabilitate and operate poorly performing&#13;
stations and other facilities and services.&#13;
1.21   While the PFC's Operational and Financial Action Plans typically include some of these&#13;
items, the Bank's experience in India's power sector suggests that minimum actions by themselves&#13;
will not be sufficient. To be sustainable, the solution to the management and performance&#13;
problems in the state power sector will have to go beyond the revitalization of SEBs and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
encouragement of private sector participation in power generation. State power strategy will also&#13;
have to include:&#13;
* Privatization of power distribution, either by sale or long-term lease-management&#13;
contracts. While theoretically possible, it is very difficult to introduce, in the public sector&#13;
at the state level, the required management and operational autonomy and performance&#13;
incentives, that are essential to successfully address the fundamental issues in power&#13;
distribution in India. Private sector participation in generation is required, but by itself is&#13;
unlikely to solve India's power problems.&#13;
* Corporatization of the remaining SEB utility operations, if any, under the Companies Act&#13;
and substantial private sector participation in utilities with government ownership&#13;
interests. Sufficient operational autonomy is unlikely with 100 percent government&#13;
ownership and may in practice in many states require majority private ownership.&#13;
Corporate unbundling, i.e. separation of generation, transmission and distribution into&#13;
separate companies (even if initially publicly-owned) should also be considered while the&#13;
sector is still fully under government ownership. Once the ownership is diversified, further&#13;
power sector restructuring becomes even more complicated. Experience from other&#13;
countries demonstrates that reliance of functional unbundling places additional&#13;
requirements on sector regulation, complicates market structures and may result in&#13;
difficulties in ensuring sufficient future investment particularly in transmission.&#13;
* Electricity tariff reform that both raises tariff revenues and introduces a tariff structure&#13;
that will reduce cross subsidies (with significant increases in agricultural and residential&#13;
tariffs) and promote efficiency in electricity use. Given the inability of most state&#13;
governments to provide large amounts of subsidies, electricity consumers will have to bear&#13;
the cost of power supply.&#13;
* Establishment of a regulatory commission, separate from the state government. Given&#13;
the track record of state governments in controlling their SEBs, a new and more&#13;
transparent approach to regulate the power industry is required, to ensure the&#13;
sustainability of tariff reform and viability of utilities meeting the regulatory commission's&#13;
performance standards, inter alia to attract sufficient private investment and protect the&#13;
interests of consumers.&#13;
1.22 The Government of India has concluded that drastic measures along these lines are&#13;
required to redress these management and performance problems in the state power sector, and its&#13;
power sector strategy is designed to encourage states to adopt such measures. But it is the states&#13;
that will need to take these decisions and implement the reforms.&#13;
1.23 Seeking to support states willing to reform their power sectors, the Central Government&#13;
has sought Bank assistance. A collaborative Government of India-Bank initiative was therefore&#13;
formally launched by the MOP in 1993, during the Conference on Power Sector Reforms held in&#13;
Jaipur in October 1993. Two follow-up seminars have since been organized, one on competitive&#13;
bidding for private generation in Hyderabad in June 1994 and another on privatization of power&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
distribution in June 1995 in Bangalore. MOP intends to organize a follow-up seminar on&#13;
restructuring and related institutional and legal matters during 1996, focusing inter alia on&#13;
Orissa's pioneering reform effort, and another seminar on competitive bidding is under discussion.&#13;
1.24 In 1993, the Government of India had requested that Cr. 1356-IN be extended to provide&#13;
immediate financing for Orissa's reform program. The Government also sought assistance for&#13;
other states from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF). In response to that request, PPF&#13;
advances have been approved and utilized to help prepare power sector restructuring projects in&#13;
Bihar, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. A restructuring study has been completed in&#13;
Haryana in 1995 and an initial tariff adjustment of about 20 percent has been implemented. In&#13;
January 1996 the Government of Haryana adopted a power sector policy which incorporates the&#13;
key reform elements outlined in para. 1.21 and is in the process of building up its reform&#13;
implementation organization. A similar restructuring study was recently completed in Uttar&#13;
Pradesh. Implementation decisions are expected in mid-1996. Two more studies - one underway&#13;
in Rajasthan and another about to start in Bihar - are due to be completed in 1996.&#13;
1.25  The proposed Orissa Power Sector Restructuring Project is the first in a planned series of&#13;
Government of India-sponsored and Bank-financed state power sector restructuring projects&#13;
supporting states willing to undertake fundamental reforms, inter alia involving significant private&#13;
distribution, corporatization, tariff reforms and independent regulatory commissions (para. 1.21)&#13;
in addition to encouraging significant private sector participation in power generation. The Orissa&#13;
power sector reform program goes even further by: (a) splitting the SEB into separate generation,&#13;
transmission, and distribution companies to effect complete corporate unbundling; and (b)&#13;
transferring Orissa's distribution system to private distribution companies by the year 2000.&#13;
1.26  India's state governments have clearly acknowledged the problems with state-run utilities&#13;
in such national forums as Power Ministers' Conferences and in the pro-reform draft reports&#13;
produced by the power committee of the National Development Council. But so far action&#13;
towards actual reform has been limited. The committee report remains to be finalized, as&#13;
consensus about its reform-related recommendations is reportedly lacking.&#13;
1.27  Not surprisingly, states that have the weakest SEBs are the most willing to consider the&#13;
radical reform of their power sectors. They can be logically expected to be among the first to&#13;
conclude that an incremental approach of attempting to revitalize their SEBs is unlikely to bring&#13;
about sustainable improvement, brought about by the realization of the magnitude of the power&#13;
challenge and the inability of the public sector-SEB monolith structure to raise financing and&#13;
deliver in the long term. States with better-performing SEBs feel less immnediate need to reform&#13;
while several others are simply unable to take action. Indications of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat&#13;
reviewing their reform options are encouraging signs of states with better-performing SEBs&#13;
starting to look ahead.&#13;
1.28 Only time will tell whether or not the Government of India's efforts to develop and&#13;
maintain nation-wide momentum for radical power sector reform will be successful. But, since it&#13;
is unrealistic to expect all states to reach political consensus at the same pace, progress in sector&#13;
restructuring and tariff and regulatory reform is likely to be uneven. This will lead to widening&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
differences in power demand and supply among states and regions during the next decade, and&#13;
could create severe problems with regional grids with adverse consequences not only for non-&#13;
reforming states but also for all interconnecting state and central utilities.&#13;
Past Bank Group Operations in the Power Sector&#13;
1.29  Over the 1980s and up to the early 1990s, IBRD followed a three-pronged strategy in its&#13;
lending to the power sector in India. It supported Government-owned agencies - NTPC in&#13;
particular - as a means of effecting sector-wide improvements. It financed a selected number of&#13;
SEBs whose management and state governments appeared to be committed to revitalization,&#13;
improving their performance in a gradual fashion. In cooperation with IFC, it financed existing&#13;
private power utilities and encouraged the Government to lower entry barriers for new investors.&#13;
1.30  The success of this strategy has been uneven, reflecting fundamental sectoral weaknesses.&#13;
Operations with central and private utilities have been generally successful; state-oriented&#13;
activities have not (Annex 1.2). IBRD tried vainly to improve the performance of SEBs by&#13;
developing close lending relationships directly with the SEBs. The revitalization of institutionally&#13;
and financially weak SEBs did not turn out to be feasible. Projects in such states failed to meet&#13;
expectations beyond the physical construction of facilities and the Bank was forced to take such&#13;
strong measures as suspending disbursement and subsequently canceling loans. SEBs generally&#13;
failed to respond to Government generated initiatives and there was no effective mechanism to&#13;
enforce compliance or elicit their cooperation, even when they failed to pay for central sector&#13;
electricity. It has become painfully clear that a sustainable solution to the sector's problems will&#13;
have to focus on SEBs and cannot resolve the power crisis through central and private sector&#13;
generation capacity additions alone.&#13;
Bank Strategy in Supporting Power Sector Reform&#13;
1.31   The country assistance strategy discussed by the Board on June 20, 1995 emphasizes&#13;
continued Bank support for the stabilization and economic reform program started by the&#13;
Govemment in 1991. It recognizes the need to encourage broad-based private sector-led growth&#13;
and the increasing importance of private market-financing as a means of fueling this growth.&#13;
Now, following the achievement of many central Government objectives of macro reform, Bank's&#13;
country assistance strategy has shifted its emphasis to implementing state-level reforms and&#13;
improving state finances. The Bank accordingly supports India's attempts to reform the state&#13;
power sector, especially since the pace of state power sector reform affects the sustainability of&#13;
the country's overall economic stabilization program. Power sector lending would therefore&#13;
focus on promoting domestic and foreign private investment; supporting the reform efforts of the&#13;
PFC, NTPC and POWERGRID; and assisting states to implement credible plans to improve the&#13;
performance and finances of their power sector.&#13;
1.32  On June 29, 1993, the Board of Directors reviewed the Bank's power sector lending&#13;
strategy while discussing the NTPC Power Generation Project (Loan 3632-IN). A update&#13;
memorandum was issued in March 1994 outlining recent developments regarding progress toward&#13;
reform at the state level (including preparatory work on state power sector restructuring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
programs); implementation of the Government of India's new private power policy; and NTPC's&#13;
and POWERGRID's performance in the implementation of Bank-supported projects approved&#13;
during the first half of 1993. Chapter 1 of the present report provides an update through mid-&#13;
1996 of the implementation of the strategy in these same key areas.&#13;
1.33   The Government's actions through NTPC, POWERGRID and PFC, the opening of the&#13;
power sector to private investment and its new state power sector restructuring program&#13;
demonstrate a clear commitment to reform. As detailed in Annex 1.2, NTPC and POWERGRID&#13;
are generally implementing their Bank-supported projects in a satisfactory manner though bill&#13;
realization from a few SEB clients needs improvement. The private sector is also responding to&#13;
Government of India's private power policy, and eight pioneer projects are progressing towards&#13;
implementation. The Government supports policies for effective institutional, regulatory and&#13;
financial restructuring that conform to guidelines for Bank lending to the power sector set forth in&#13;
the policy paper "The World Bank's Role in the Electric Power Sector" (1992). Annex 1.3&#13;
measures India's reforms against Bank guidelines and discusses possible further Bank support for&#13;
both center and state reform in the context of these recommendations.&#13;
Lending for State Power Sector Reform&#13;
1.34  Notwithstanding the progress made, the reform process in the power sector has only just&#13;
begun, and much remains to be done - particularly at the state level - to reverse the old&#13;
unproductive trends. India today needs to take actions to improve the quality of its fiscal&#13;
adjustment. There has been, for instance, virtually no adjustment in the states' fiscal deficits,&#13;
which presently constrain the flexibility in central Government's ability to make grants and loans&#13;
to the states. The Government's fiscal deficit could be reduced more rapidly if the states were&#13;
able to mobilize resources and cut expenditures more rapidly. By cutting subsidies and reducing&#13;
public spending in the power sector - an area where the private sector can readily take over - state&#13;
power sector reform would promote fiscal adjustment at the state. The proposed project&#13;
demonstrates how significant and rapid this adjustment could be (paras. 5.4-7).&#13;
1.35  The proposed project is the first in a planned series of Bank state power sector&#13;
restructuring projects to support state power reforms following the series of relatively&#13;
unsuccessful SEB operations of the 1980s. The project is the first concrete breakthrough in the&#13;
protracted dialogue of recent years and was processed in coordination with the IFC, which&#13;
supports the reform program by helping finance Orissa's first private power generation project&#13;
under an operation approved in July 1994. Preparatory work on similar projects under&#13;
Government's state power sector restructuring program is under way in several other states with&#13;
Bank support (para. 1.24). The timing and number of follow-up operations will depend on the&#13;
states' willingness to undertake restructuring of their power sectors and to develop a transparent&#13;
regulatory regime. But it is not likely that many states will be able to reach political consensus&#13;
and will therefore face continuing deterioration in power supply. The Bank will not finance or&#13;
guarantee power sector investments in such states.&#13;
1.36  The Bank's lending program would provide a forum to continue the dialogue on state&#13;
power sector reform as well as some of the incentives needed to help states make tough decisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
The guarantee authority will be used with the same underlying objectives, and will be limited to&#13;
reforming states. Although the Bank will continue to use the existing portfolio to support these&#13;
reforms, this route has been taken to its limits at the state level. After the loan closings and&#13;
related actions in recent years, significant exposure is now limited to the state of Maharashtra.&#13;
Future Lending to NTPC and POWERGRID&#13;
1.37 NTPC and POWERGRID are contributing to India's overall reform effort directly by&#13;
providing additional generation capacity and improving transmission and system operations and&#13;
indirectly by investment and commercial policies that promote SEB improvement. Further Bank&#13;
support to both is therefore envisaged:&#13;
* To NTPC to help it increase the supply of electric power and to improve the&#13;
environmental performance of its power stations. NTPC has demonstrated its capabilities&#13;
in project implementation and has shown increasing willingness to address environmental&#13;
and resettlement and rehabilitation issues.&#13;
* To POWERGRID to help it develop system coordination and control facilities and create&#13;
a national power grid, to pursue the further reform of bulk power and transmission tariffs&#13;
and to facilitate financially, commercially, environmentally and operationally sound private&#13;
power development in large, multi-state mega power projects.&#13;
1.38  Bank assistance to NTPC and POWERGRID is premised on their applying their&#13;
investment and commercial policies. Possibilities for using the Bank's guarantee authority will&#13;
also be explored in connection with future operations. The Bank could, for instance, assist NTPC&#13;
in establishing joint ventures with private domestic and foreign investors and could assist&#13;
POWERGRID in facilitating private sector mega power projects and providing related&#13;
transmission.&#13;
2. ORISSA'S POWER SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM&#13;
Orissa Power Sector&#13;
2.1   At the end of 1995, the installed power generation capacity in the Orissa power system&#13;
was about 3,000 MW, consisting of about 1,700 MW divided among five plants owned and&#13;
operated by the Orissa State Electricity Board (OSEB) and the Department of Energy of the&#13;
Government of Orissa, a 420 MW coal-fired plant just commissioned in lb Valley by the state-&#13;
owned Orissa Power Generation Corporation (OPGC), 725 MW in two large industrial captive&#13;
power plants (of which about 100 MW output is being sold to OSEB), and 115 MW in a joint&#13;
Andhra Pradesh/Orissa hydroelectric power plant (of which Orissa's share is 34 MW).&#13;
2.2   OSEB's operational performance has been among the poorest among all state electricity&#13;
boards (SEBs) in India. In early 1990s, thermal plant efficiency and availability were low and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
technical and commercial system losses exceeded 40 percent. Until very recently, moreover, the&#13;
chronic lack of funds has prevented OSEB from undertaking rehabilitation projects to reverse this&#13;
situation. While still less than satisfactory (details are given in Annex 2. 1), OSEB's financial&#13;
performance in recent years compares more favorably with that of most SEBs, reflecting&#13;
substantial tariff adjustments, Government subsidies and improvements in billing and collection.&#13;
OSEB has also been able to secure funds from the Power Finance Corporation (partly originating&#13;
from ADB and ODA) and the Bank to initiate measures to improve Orissa's power system and&#13;
has contracted AES Transpower, a private United States power developer, to build two additional&#13;
250 MW units at Orissa's lb power station.&#13;
2.3    Orissa has about 1.3 million customers. Industries account for about 54 percent of the&#13;
total electricity consumption and their share would be even higher without supply limitations&#13;
OSEB has imposed on them in past years. Residential consumers account for about 26 percent&#13;
and agriculture 6 percent, of the state's total electricity consumption. Power shortages in Orissa&#13;
have in the past exceeded the all-India averages (para. 1. 1). The situation has improved&#13;
considerably with new capacity and currently the inadequate transmission and distribution system&#13;
rather than generation capacity prevents the potential demand to be supplied. Additions at Ib, the&#13;
600 MW Upper Indravati hydroelectric station (para. 2.5) and the increasing supply to Orissa&#13;
from NTPC's projects in the Eastern region (including two 500 MW Talcher units supported&#13;
under Ln. 2845-IN and the rehabilitated ex-OSEB Talcher) would double the generation capacity&#13;
available for Orissa by 2000 from fiscal 1995.&#13;
2.4   But both the Government of Orissa and OSEB recognized that these generation capacity&#13;
additions, though a major achievement, will not in themselves be sufficient. They have therefore&#13;
initiated a comprehensive program of reforms to address the fundamental problems with sector&#13;
management and financing and to correct power system weaknesses. Successful completion of&#13;
the reform program would eliminate power cuts and supply restrictions by 2000, and Orissa could&#13;
achieve sustained power development for its own needs and export, supported by its vast coal and&#13;
significant hydroelectric resources.&#13;
Bank Involvement in Orissa&#13;
Upper Indravati Project&#13;
2.5   Bank involvement in the Orissa power sector goes back to the early 1980s, to the&#13;
preparation and approval in June 1983 of Cr. 1356-IN and Ln. 2278-IN for the 600 MW power&#13;
component of the Upper Indravati multipurpose hydroelectric project. The project, however,&#13;
experienced severe difficulties in part due to poor management and in part due to a natural&#13;
disaster in July 1991. In 1991 the Orissa government agreed to drastically reorganize the Upper&#13;
Indravati Project's management and implementation strategies, including those related to&#13;
resettlement and rehabilitation of persons to be displaced by the project, in return for continued&#13;
Bank support for the project. Since substantial disbursements could be justified only after the&#13;
project reorganization and reactivation, the Bank canceled the still completely unused US$156&#13;
million Ln. 2278-IN in December 1991.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.6   Reorganization of the Upper Indravati Project turned out to be a painstaking endeavor,&#13;
taking substantially longer than expected. But while the reorganization process was finally&#13;
substantially completed, a procurement technicality first prevented Bank financing of a balance-of-&#13;
works contract replacing terminated non-performing contractors and then various primarily&#13;
environmental concerns (inter alia sedimentation control and mitigation at the power station and&#13;
reservoir, penstock construction, and the mitigation of potential environmental impacts caused by&#13;
an irrigation emergency bypass) led to further requirements to be met prior to Bank funding for&#13;
the remaining items. Bank funding had to be deferred and delinked from the proposed Orissa&#13;
Power Sector Restructuring Project. In the meantime, Cr. 1356-IN was depleted in March 1995.&#13;
The forthcoming Implementation Completion Review for Cr. 1356-IN will document the Upper&#13;
Indravati experience in detail. The completion of the Upper Indravati project was threatened by&#13;
the lack of funds up to March 1996, when Orissa secured Rs 3,200 million completion financing&#13;
from PFC. In conclusion, it must be noted that in spite of the extra-ordinary problems and delays,&#13;
the project is still projected to provide power at a highly attractive rate (at less than 50 per cent of&#13;
the cost of electricity from new base-load thermal stations) and remains a priority component in&#13;
the Orissa/Eastern region power system. OHPC's challenge is to realize this potential by&#13;
completing the Upper Indravati project, for which it now has the necessary funding.&#13;
Power Sector Reform Dialogue&#13;
2.7   Since 1992 the Government of Orissa, OSEB and the Bank have discussed the issues and&#13;
a variety of possible solutions to Orissa's fundamental power problems. In 1993, the Government&#13;
of Orissa and OSEB agreed upon a power sector reform program - which involves substantial&#13;
privatization and complete separation of the power sector from direct government control - as the&#13;
logical conclusion to these deliberations. The Orissa government's commitment to power sector&#13;
reform was formally conveyed to the Bank by Orissa's chief minister in a letter in November 1993.&#13;
The reform program was formally approved by Orissa's Council of Ministers in April 1994 and&#13;
has since been endorsed by the new state government, which took office in Orissa in March 1995.&#13;
On April 20, 1995, the Orissa government issued a formal statement of its power sector policy (an&#13;
updated April 4, 1996 version is attached as Annex 2.2). Events triggering the use of remedies of&#13;
the Bank under the proposed project include those which shall make it improbable that the&#13;
provisions of the policy statement, or a significant part thereof will be carried out.&#13;
Immediate Bank Support&#13;
2.8   Well before the proposed new Bank loan, implementation of the reform program had&#13;
already started. The Orissa government and OSEB have taken measures to improve OSEB's&#13;
operational and financial performance and creditworthiness. As requested by the governments of&#13;
India and Orissa, the closing date of Cr. 1356-IN was extended at the end of 1993 by one year&#13;
and again at the end of 1994, to June 30, 1995 for immediate support for this program in fiscal&#13;
1994 and 1995, including the establishment of a reform implementation organization and financing&#13;
of consultants to help the Orissa government launch the program. The Bank has also assisted the&#13;
Orissa government efforts to raise financial and technical assistance from ADB, ODA and PFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Orissa's Power Sector Reform Program&#13;
2.9    Orissa, as a pioneer among the states in India, has decided to restructure and substantially&#13;
privatize its power sector. The Orissa government's ultimate objective is to withdraw from the&#13;
power sector as an operator of utilities and to have competing, privately managed utilities&#13;
operating in an appropriately-regulated power market. The power sector industry and market&#13;
structures established under this reform program have been defined to reach this objective with no&#13;
further institutional restructuring, and significant private sector participation will be required.&#13;
2.10   Orissa's power sector reform program (Annex 2.3) involves: (a) the unbundling and&#13;
structural separation of generation, transmission, and distribution into separate services to be&#13;
provided by separate companies; (b) private sector participation in the new hydroelectric&#13;
generation and transmission utilities, the Grid Corporation of Orissa (GRIDCO) and the Orissa&#13;
Hydro Power Corporation (OHPC); (c) privatization of thermal generation and distribution; (d)&#13;
competitive bidding for new generation; (e) the development of an autonomous power sector&#13;
regulatory agency, the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commssion; and (f) reforming of electricity&#13;
tariffs at the bulk power, transmission, and retail levels.&#13;
The Orissa Electricity Reform Act, 1995 (the Reform Legislation)&#13;
2.11   New legislation, the Orissa Electricity Reform Act, 1995 (Orissa Act 2 of 1996), had to be&#13;
enacted to: (a) establish in law a state-level regulatory commission independent of the state&#13;
government and power utilities; (b) effect the asset, liability and staff transfers from the Orissa&#13;
government and OSEB to GRIDCO and OHPC; and (c) transfer the statutory duties allocated to&#13;
OSEB under the 1948 Electricity (Supply) Act (including the basic obligation to serve) to the&#13;
Regulatory Commission, GRIDCO, and the distributors.&#13;
2.12   The Act was passed by the State Assembly in November 1995, notified in the Official&#13;
Gazette in January 1996 and became effective on April 1, 1996. The Act establishes the&#13;
Regulatory Commission and defines its functions, provides for the licensing of transmission and&#13;
supply of electricity, and provides for the Government of Orissa to restructure Orissa's power&#13;
sector and vest in companies licensed by the Commission certain assets, rights, and liabilities of&#13;
OSEB. Events triggering the use of remedies of the Bank under the proposed project include&#13;
those which make it improbable that the provisions of the Government's power sector policy&#13;
statement or the Act, or a significant part thereof will be carried out.&#13;
The Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission&#13;
2.13   The Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission is an autonomous authority responsible for&#13;
the regulation of the power sector. The structure selected for the Regulatory Commission is a&#13;
three-member commission with necessary support staff. Its objective is to help ensure the&#13;
operational, managerial, and financial autonomy of the new utilities in Orissa's power sector, to&#13;
promote transparency, efficiency, and economy; and to help Orissa attract private capital for&#13;
power sector development while safeguarding the interests of consumers. Under the new Act,&#13;
both GRIDCO and the distributors function as licensees and will be regulated by the Commission&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15-&#13;
in the performance of their statutory and license obligations. At negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached that disbursements under Part A of the proposed project will commence only after the&#13;
Regulatory Commission has been formally established in a manner satisfactory to the Bank,&#13;
requiring inter alia that the three commissioners and the Commission's initial staff are in place&#13;
and the first set of regulations have been adopted and notified by the Commission.&#13;
The Orissa Hydro Power Corporation (OHPC)&#13;
2.14  The hydroelectric stations earlier owned and run by the Orissa government and OSEB are&#13;
owned and operated by OHPC from April 1, 1996 as per the Orissa government's transfer order&#13;
under the new Act. OHPC's operations and organization; institutional development, staffing and&#13;
training; private sector participation; investments; and finances are detailed in Annex 2.4.&#13;
2.15  OHPC is initially owned by Government of Orissa. During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached that OHPC will list its shares and the Government of Orissa and OHPC will offer them&#13;
for sale to the public in accordance with a program and timetable satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
2.16  New thermal generation capacity will also be developed by the private sector. The first&#13;
private power project is expected to reach financial closure during 1996 and a competitive bidding&#13;
process for the second project is underway. The sale of Talcher, OSEB's only existing thermal&#13;
station, to NTPC was approved in June 1995. OPGC's Ib units 1-2 are to be privatized, most&#13;
likely through the sale of the majority of OPGC's shares to private investors. The first&#13;
disinvestment, about 20-30 percent of the Government's stake in OPGC, is expected during fiscal&#13;
1997. Just like OPGC, also OHPC and individual private generating companies will function as&#13;
generating companies under the 1948 Electricity (Supply) Act.&#13;
The Grid Corporation of Orissa (GRIDCO)&#13;
2.17  GRIDCO is responsible for transmission, coordination of system planning and operations&#13;
and initially, distribution and bulk power procurement, from April 1, 1996 as per the Orissa&#13;
government's transfer order under the new Act. GRIDCO is also the main executing agency of&#13;
investments supported under the proposed project. Its operations and organization; institutional&#13;
development, staffing and training; private sector participation; distribution privatization program;&#13;
investments; and finances are detailed in Annex 2.5.&#13;
2.18  Distribution privatization is a key feature of the reform program. At negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached that GRIDCO will gradually transfer its distribution system to private&#13;
distribution companies in accordance with a program and timetable satisfactory to the Bank. A&#13;
distribution operations agreement covering three of Orissa's ten distribution circles is about to be&#13;
signed with a private distribution company, an agreed disbursement condition. It leaves seven&#13;
more circles to be transferred in stages during project implementation. GRIDCO has a mandate to&#13;
privatize its distribution operations by the end of 2000.&#13;
2.19  GRIDCO purchases power from OHPC and other generating companies under Power&#13;
Purchase Agreements and sells in bulk to its own distribution divisions and to the emerging four&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
new private distribution companies, which are also allowed (and in future are expected to be able)&#13;
to buy directly from the generators.&#13;
2.20  GRIDCO is initially owned by the Government of Orissa, which will attempt to attract&#13;
private sector participation. At negotiations, agreement was reached that GRIDCO will list its&#13;
shares and the Government of Orissa and GRIDCO will offer them for sale to the public in&#13;
accordance with a program and timetable satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
Corporatization and Commercialization&#13;
2.21   GRIDCO and OHPC were incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, on April 20 and&#13;
21, 1995, respectively and became full-fledged utilities with the transfer of assets on April 1, 1996&#13;
under the new Act. Their boards of directors and management were appointed in the course of&#13;
1995, including significant non-government representation on the boards and externally-recruited&#13;
functional directors in the areas of finance, commercial and human resources development.&#13;
Corporatization agreements were signed in March 1996, to further spell out the respective&#13;
responsibilities of the Orissa government and its two new utilities. In essence, the Government&#13;
reiterated and fleshed out its earlier policy decisions to stay out of their day-to-day management&#13;
and give GRIDCO and OHPC management and operational autonomy as commercial&#13;
organizations. Events triggering the use of remedies of the Bank under the proposed project&#13;
include amendments to their memoranda and articles of association and corporatization&#13;
agreements which would materially and adversely affect the operations or financial condition&#13;
GRIDCO or OHPC or their ability to carry out the project.&#13;
2.22   GRIDCO's and OHPC's tariffs are set so as to enable them to earn returns comparable to&#13;
those allowed to private investors in the power sector and make reasonable contributions to the&#13;
financing of their investments from internal cash generation. Upon transfer, assets were revalued&#13;
at their estimated depreciated replacement cost, raising the historic value of GRIDCO's&#13;
transmission and distribution assets by over 200 percent and OHPC's hydro assets by over 300&#13;
percent. These are path-breaking decisions - SEBs have never been permitted to revalue their&#13;
fixed assets and earn commercial returns - to put GRIDCO's and OHPC's tariffs and finances on a&#13;
sound basis and will subsequently, at the time of privatization, enable the Orissa government to&#13;
realize a more realistic value for its past investments. They also help eliminate GRIDCO's and&#13;
OHPC's dependence on budgetary support from the state government.&#13;
Reform Consultation&#13;
2.23   Orissa's power sector reform program has been prepared in consultation with the&#13;
management, staff and labor unions of OSEB. Consultations with the public at large have taken&#13;
place through the forum of the Orissa State Power Consultative Council, which brings together&#13;
the state government, OSEB, and its main consumer groups. A comprehensive public information&#13;
campaign is also underway. Following the enactment of the reform legislation and the&#13;
establishment of the Regulatory Commission, public consultation will be continued, inter alia by&#13;
the Regulatory Commission through its new Commission Advisory Committee and direct&#13;
hearings.&#13;

3.   THE PROJECT&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
3.1   The proposed Orissa Power Sector Restructuring Project would assist Orissa in: (a)&#13;
implementing a program of regulatory, institutional and tariff reforms in its power sector; (b)&#13;
supporting the institutional development of GRIDCO, OHPC and the new Regulatory&#13;
Commission established under the reform program; (c) reinforcing and rehabilitating Orissa's&#13;
power system and its demand-side management to make power supply and consumption more&#13;
efficient; and (d) upgrading the power sector's environmental performance and strengthening the&#13;
environmental management capabilities of the new utilities.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
3.2   Part A: Reinforcing and Rehabilitating the Transmission and Distribution Systems and&#13;
Developing Private Power Distribution. The proposed project would support GRIDCO and&#13;
private distribution companies in carrying out programs to rehabilitate Orissa's transmission and&#13;
distribution system and reduce system losses in fiscal 1997-2003.&#13;
3.3   Part B: Demand-Side Management (DSM). The project would support GRIDCO's and&#13;
the electricity end-users' programs to carry out a state-wide metering and other DSM&#13;
investments. (For the purposes of this project, demand-side management is defined as identifying&#13;
and implementing initiatives that improve the use of power supply capacity by changing patterns&#13;
for demand).&#13;
3.4   Part C: Institutional Development, Training and Technical Assistance. The project&#13;
would assist Orissa in implement its power sector reform program and support the institutional&#13;
development of GRIDCO, OHPC and the Regulatory Commission.&#13;
Part A: Rehabilitating Orissa's Transmission and Distribution Systems and Developing&#13;
Private Power Distribution (US$599 million of the project's US$740-million base cost).&#13;
3.5   Investments under Part A of the proposed project would be used to rehabilitate Orissa's&#13;
transmission and distribution system and to reduce the current high level of system losses,&#13;
objectives in line with the reform program to develop commercially viable, efficient utilities.&#13;
3.6   OSEB/GRIDCO staff, the Planning Working Group of the Reform Implementation&#13;
Organization, and Orissa's consultants have prepared a ten-year investment plan for the Orissa&#13;
power sector (Annex 3. 1). The project would support the implementation of the plan by funding&#13;
the transmission and distribution projects included in the fiscal 1997-2003 time-slice of the plan.&#13;
These projects cover 400, 220, and 132 kV transmission lines and substations; 33 kV, I I kV, and 0.4&#13;
kV subtransmission and distribution lines; and substations, capacitor banks, and implementation of a&#13;
program for the reduction of non-technical losses. By funding the rehabilitation of the transformer&#13;
workshops, laboratory equipment, vehicles, and a portion of its initial working capital&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
requirements, (such items as spares and stocks), Part A of the Project also supports the&#13;
establishment of GRIDCO.&#13;
Part B: Demand-Side Management (US$97 million base cost).&#13;
3.7   Demand-side management initiatives to be implemented under the Project would involve a&#13;
mix of pricing reform, metering, and other load management and conservation strategies designed&#13;
to increase the incentives to use electricity more efficiently:&#13;
*  The level of electricity tariffs has already been raised significantly, for the fifth time in&#13;
three years in November 1995. The Regulatory Commission is being established and&#13;
financial covenants on OHPC and GRIDCO would be incorporated in the loan agreement&#13;
to help maintain proper tariff levels in the future.&#13;
*  The structure of electricity tariffs has already been improved and future adjustments would&#13;
continue Orissa's the program of structural improvements to contain cross-subsidies and&#13;
give consumers more accurate signals about the cost of supply at peak and off-peak.&#13;
Once the required time-of-day meters (already purchased) are installed under the proposed&#13;
project, time-of-day tariffs would be introduced for large industrial consumers.&#13;
*  The reform legislation and licenses require GRIDCO and the new distribution utilities to&#13;
promote more efficient use of electricity by their consumers (Annex 2.3). The Regulatory&#13;
Commission will enforce this new regulatory obligation.&#13;
*  Under the part B of the Project, a program of metering and other investments would be&#13;
implemented. Considerable potential exists to improve the efficiency of power supply and&#13;
consumption in Orissa through better load management and electricity conservation. The&#13;
majority of OSEB's consumer meters inherited by GRIDCO are defective and would be&#13;
replaced as the first step of the investment program under Part B. The Metering Working&#13;
Group has prepared a US$50 million metering program, which would cover about 13,600&#13;
meters for grid substations and other system requirements and for the largest consumers,&#13;
about 27,500 three-phase meters for other large consumers, and about 600,000 single-&#13;
phase meters for small consumers. Advance procurement started in 1994, first contracts&#13;
were awarded in mid-1995.&#13;
* Promising specific load management and conservation investments have also been&#13;
identified and are being prepared. These include: load management and power factor&#13;
compensation in industries; industrial cogeneration in sugar, chemicals, and metallurgical&#13;
units; vapor absorption refrigeration in hotels and commercial offices; rewinding of&#13;
motors; and municipal water pumping. Part B of the project would support the&#13;
implementation of the first batch of these investments and similar projects by GRIDCO&#13;
and electricity end-users (Annex 3.2).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
Part C: Institutional Development, Training and Technical Assistance (US$44 million base&#13;
cost).&#13;
3.8   Part C of the Project involves several interrelated components to support the&#13;
implementation of the reform program as well as the development of GRIDCO, OHPC and the&#13;
Regulatory Commission and the training of their staff. The main components (and consultant&#13;
contract values) are listed below. (The status of consultant recruitment is discussed in Chapter 4).&#13;
* The Reform Consultant (under a US$13.3 million contract) is helping (since 1994) the&#13;
Govemment of Orissa to implement its power sector reform program. Phase I of the&#13;
consultant's services has already been completed. The focus of phase 2 work is on the&#13;
Regulatory Commission, distribution privatization, competitive bidding for new&#13;
generation, and the operationalization of the new decentralized industry and market&#13;
structures (Annex 2.3).&#13;
* Institution building consultants (under a US$6.8 million contract) are supporting (since&#13;
1995) the development of GRIDCO and OPGC (para. 4.2 and Annex 4.1).&#13;
* Project management and engineering and environmental services would be provided for&#13;
the implementation of Parts A and B (under a contract estimated at about US$8.0 million).&#13;
* Two additional technical assistance activities have been prepared and would be&#13;
implemented under Part C. They are designed to help OHPC develop its environmental&#13;
management capabilities and to help GRIDCO implement the DSM component of the&#13;
reform program. These assignments (under contracts estimated at about US$2.0-2.5&#13;
million each) would complement the overall development efforts of GRIDCO and OHPC,&#13;
respond to specific priority areas under the reform program, and inter alia help implement&#13;
the demand-side management and environmental management components specified in&#13;
Parts A and B of the project.&#13;
* Staff rationalization and training of power sector staff and the provision of related&#13;
materials and facilities would also be covered under Part C in accordance with the plans&#13;
prepared by GRIDCO, OHPC, and their institutional development consultants.&#13;
Environment and Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&amp;R)&#13;
3.9   The project has a B-rating for the purpose of the Bank's Operational Directive 4.01, and&#13;
no major environmental or resettlement issues are envisaged. Investments would entail mainly&#13;
transmission and distribution rehabilitation under Part A and the purchase of meters and other&#13;
demand-side management equipment under Part B. The project's environmental assessment is&#13;
attached in Annex 3.3, its environmental benefits are summarized in para. 5.3.&#13;
3.10  Under the 1980 Conservation of Forest Act, approval for new transmission lines must be&#13;
obtained from the regional office of the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MOEF). Power line&#13;
routing in India undergoes extensive review in the project planning stage. OSEB (and under the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
project, its successor GRIDCO), must include alternative route surveys to demonstrate that the&#13;
power line routing involves a minimum of forest land. The alternative routes are surveyed jointly&#13;
by GRIDCO and the Government of Orissa's Department of Forestry (DOF) personnel. MOEF&#13;
clearance is not required if the joint line survey concludes that no forest land is involved, in which&#13;
case DOF would grant a waiver.&#13;
3.11   Under the Indian Telegraph Act, transmission towers can be erected on private land;&#13;
compensation must be paid. Ownership of the land is therefore not acquired by the transmission&#13;
company.&#13;
3.12   The appraisal criteria (para. 4.10) for investments to be financed under the project require&#13;
GRIDCO to address these and other potential environmental issues and to design such&#13;
appropriate mitigation strategies as resettlement and rehabilitation (where needed); studies to&#13;
determine transmission line rights of way and the impact on land use (agricultural, forest areas,&#13;
wetlands, wildlands) of various substation sites; access roads to remote areas; the clearing and control&#13;
of vegetation in rights of ways; control of erosion during construction and along access roads,&#13;
substations and transmission tower sites; measures to deal with potential electromagnetic frequency&#13;
(EMF) radiation effects; (central government regulations call for minimum transmission line clearance&#13;
distances to address EMF effects); radio noise, television interference, and audible noise along&#13;
transmission line routes; ways to regulate public access to substations and towers to minimize&#13;
electrocution hazards (GRIDCO will effect restriction of public access by fencing and security of&#13;
substations and towers). The project management consultants will help GRIDCO appraise investments&#13;
and implement Part A of the project, including the preparation and execution of environmental&#13;
mitigation.&#13;
Cost Estimates&#13;
3.13   The project cost is estimated at US$948 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange&#13;
component of US$609 million equivalent (64 percent) and taxes and duties estimated at about&#13;
US$195 million equivalent. The total financing required, including interest during construction&#13;
(IDC), is US$997 million (Table 3.1 and Annexes 3.1-3.2).&#13;

for 2002 and 2.1 percent for subsequent years (calendar year basis). These estimates for international inflation are&#13;
consistent with the Bank's latest G-5 MUV index, which is updated periodically. Local costs are escalated at 8.5&#13;
percent for 1996, 8.0 percent for 1997, 7.5 percent for 1998, 7.0 percent for 1999 and 6.0 percent for subsequent&#13;
years on a calendar year basis.&#13;
Project Financing&#13;
3.14   Total financing required for the proposed project, including IDC, is US$997 million, of&#13;
which the proposed Bank loan would finance US$350 million equivalent or 57 percent of the&#13;
foreign exchange costs excluding IDC. ADB financing, channeled through PFC, is in place. Also&#13;
approved and under implementation is ODA's technical assistance grant of about US$19 million&#13;
equivalent (pound 12 million). A trust fund, administered by the Bank on behalf of ODA, was set&#13;
up in August 1995 to finance the phase 2 services of the Reform Consultant and related items&#13;
amounting to about US$11 million equivalent (pound 6.8 million). The balance of ODA's grant is&#13;
being administered directly by ODA (para. 4.6).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
3.15  The approval of the proposed Bank loan is expected to trigger additional ODA&#13;
cofinancing of about US$110 million (pound 75 million) by mid-1996. The Government of&#13;
Orissa would provide about US$26 million. Local financiers including PFC, the Industrial&#13;
Development Bank of India (IDBI), the General Insurance Corporation and the Life Insurance&#13;
Corporation are expected to provide another US$233 million. It is projected that GRIDCO&#13;
would finance about US$222 million equivalent from internally generated resources (Table 3.2).&#13;

Terms and Conditions&#13;
3.16  The Borrower would be India, acting by its President. Loan terms would include standard&#13;
variable interest rate, five years of grace period and a final maturity of twenty years. The closing&#13;
date of the loan would be December 31, 2002. At negotiations, agreement was reached that:&#13;
* The Government of India will onlend the proceeds of the loan to the Government of&#13;
Orissa, under its standard arrangements for developmental assistance to the states, and&#13;
that this loan would be fully additional to Orissa's plan assistance.&#13;
*  The Government of Orissa will onlend the proceeds to GRIDCO (under Parts A-C of the&#13;
project), and, if necessary, to OBPC (under Part C), private distribution companies (under&#13;
Part A) and electricity end-users (under Part B) on terms and conditions acceptable to the&#13;
Bank and will, without setting off any amounts that may be due to it from GRIDCO and&#13;
OHPC, release funds simultaneous to releases by the Government of India.&#13;
3.17  The expected onlending terms are a 13 percent rate of interest, five years of grace, and a&#13;
final maturity of fifteen years for GRIDCO and OHPC. Comparable terms for onlending would&#13;
be offered to private distribution companies and electricity end-users. Onlending by Government&#13;
of Orissa to private distribution companies under Part A would be subject to these companies&#13;
having been selected through procedures acceptable to the Bank and having submitted&#13;
satisfactory project reports and financing plans; the latter requirement would also apply to&#13;
onlending by the Government of Orissa or GRIDCO to electricity end-users (under Part B).&#13;
GRIDCO would also be allowed to lease items purchased under the loan to private distribution&#13;
companies and electricity end-users.&#13;
&#13;

a. Not Bank financed.  b: Due to rounding, numbers may not add up.&#13;
Part A&#13;
3.19 US$260 million of the proposed Bank loan is allocated to transmission and distribution&#13;
projects under Part A of the project. The bulk of procurement (in terms of value), including all&#13;
B^ank-financed contracts, under Part A (which accounts for about 80 percent of the project's total&#13;
cost) would be awarded through international competitive bidding (ICB) using ICB tender&#13;
documents approved by the Bank and extensively used under two large POWERGRID loans, Ln.&#13;
3577-IN and Ln. 3237-IN. Most would be supply and erection contracts. In view of long lead&#13;
times and to obtain most favorable prices through competition, GRIDCO would procure selected&#13;
main items (transformers, conductors, switchgear) in bulk on the basis of estimated total&#13;
requirements, then make these items available to the supply and erection contractors.&#13;
3.20   To provide for better project control and expeditious completion, three large transmission&#13;
line supply and erection contracts would be awarded. Each contract would include surveying and&#13;
clearing of the line routes; line design; procurement of equipment, materials, and structures&#13;
(though some would be made available by GRIDCO); transporting to site; and the construction&#13;
and commissioning of the lines. These contracts would range in value from about US$30 million&#13;
to US$50 million. One smaller contract, of about US$8 million, will also be awarded. Substation&#13;
supply and erection contracts would include design and specification of equipment ensuring&#13;
compatibility with existing equipment where necessary; procurement of all equipment, relays, and&#13;
cables (though some would be provided by GRIDCO); civil works; and erection, testing, and&#13;
commissioning. These four substation contracts would range in value from about US$5 million to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
US$ 15 million. The subtransmission and distribution system upgrading contracts would be&#13;
awarded as four geographically defined packages, values ranging from about US$35 million to&#13;
US$50 million. The bulk supply contracts, about 25 in number, range in value from about US$5&#13;
up to US$15 million. A large number of contracts of small value are in implementation or&#13;
procurement stage, under financing arrangements not including the Bank.&#13;
3.21  Separate civil works contracts are not envisaged under Part A. The erection portion,&#13;
including limited civil works under supply and erection contracts, is estimated at about US$130&#13;
million, of which about US$70 million equivalent under the proposed loan.&#13;
Part B&#13;
3.22  US$80 million of the proposed Bank loan is allocated to demand-side management.&#13;
Contracts for the supply and installation of meters, for which US$50 million is allocated under the&#13;
proposed loan, would be awarded through ICB. Tender documents accounting for about 8&#13;
percent of the total project cost have already been finalized by OSEB/GRIDCO and approved by&#13;
the Bank. Advanced procurement has started (para 4.11) and three contracts ranging from about&#13;
US$1 million to about US$4 million have been awarded.&#13;
3.23  The balance of Part B, for which US$30 million is allocated under the proposed loan,&#13;
would primarily consist of a large number of small contracts averaging about US$50,000. Most&#13;
are expected to fall below the US$250,000 ICB threshold - ICB procurement would account for&#13;
about US$5 million. Supply, as well as supply and erection, contracts amounting to about US$20&#13;
million would be awarded through national competitive bidding (NCB). National shopping&#13;
would amount to about US$5 million, under contracts up to US$25,000 in value, averaging about&#13;
US$10,000. Separate civil works contracts are not envisaged. (The erection portion, including&#13;
limited civil works under the supply and erection contracts, is estimated at US$5 million&#13;
equivalent under the proposed loan).&#13;
Part C&#13;
3.24  US$10 million ofthe proposed Bank loan is allocated for consultancies and training. The&#13;
main Bank-financed consultant contract (the Reform Consultant) has already been awarded (in&#13;
accordance with Bank Guidelines on the Use of Consulting Services) under Cr. 1356-IN.&#13;
Payments under existing contracts would be financed (reimbursed) by the Bank under the&#13;
proposed new loan.&#13;
3.25  Under the Part C, ODA would recruit and finance the balance of consultants. The balance&#13;
of the ongoing phase 2 of the Reform Consultant's services would be financed under the Bank-&#13;
administered ODA trust fund. ODA is also expected to finance further services (phase 3 or its&#13;
equivalent) and provide consultants to help implement Parts A and B of the project (paras. 4.3&#13;
and 4.5). The Bank has not required a cross-conditionality with ODA financing. In case ODA&#13;
funding does not materialize or is terminated, such services would be financed under the proposed&#13;
Bank loan, in which case Bank guidelines on the use of consultants would apply. Funds would be&#13;
reallocated to Part C from Part A.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Bank Reviews&#13;
3.26  Prior Bank review of bid documents and approval of all contracts expected to cost the&#13;
equivalent of US$500,000 or more would be mandatory. All procurement under Part A,&#13;
consultant contracts under Part C, and the metering component of Part B is expected to fall under&#13;
this category. Smaller contracts would be subject to selective post-award review. The aggregate&#13;
value of such contracts, all to be awarded under Part B, is not expected to exceed US$30 million&#13;
(about 9 percent of the total loan amount).&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
3.27  Disbursements from the proposed Bank loan would be made against:&#13;
* 100 percent of foreign currency expenditures (CIF).&#13;
*  100 percent of the local ex-factory cost.&#13;
* 80 percent of other local expenditures for equipment.&#13;
* 70 percent of expenditures for civil works and erection services.&#13;
*  100 percent of services rendered by consultants.&#13;
3.28  Disbursements for equipment contracts valued at less than US$500,000 equivalent; for&#13;
civil works and erection contracts valued at less than US$500,000; and for consulting services&#13;
contracts to firms valued less than US$100,000 or to individual consultants valued at less than&#13;
US$50,000 would be made against statements of expenditures (SOEs), the documentation of&#13;
which would not be sent to the Bank but would be retained by GRIDCO and OHPC for&#13;
inspection by supervision missions. Total Bank funding for such contracts is estimated at about&#13;
US$30 million under Parts B and D. All other disbursements would be fully documented.&#13;
3.29  To facilitate disbursements, a special account would be established for the Bank loan with&#13;
an authorized allocation of US$12.0 million, equivalent to four months of average disbursements&#13;
through the Special Account. At negotiations, agreement was reached that the Government of&#13;
India will advance funds to the Government of Orissa and that the Government of Orissa will&#13;
advance funds to GRIDCO and OHPC simultaneous with releases by the Bank. Annex 3.4 shows&#13;
the estimated disbursement schedule as derived from the construction programs of the project&#13;
components assuming normal terms for commercial payments, including retention payments.&#13;
Retroactive Financing&#13;
3.30  Responding to request from the governments of India and Orissa, the Bank extended the&#13;
closing date of Cr. 1356-IN to June 30, 1995 to minimize the gap between the closing of Cr.&#13;
1356-IN and the effectiveness of the proposed new loan. The credit was exhausted, however, in&#13;
March 1995. Expenditures under eligible contracts originally awarded but not reimbursed under&#13;
the credit would be reimbursed by the Bank retroactively at effectiveness of the new loan. At&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached to use up to US$7 million (or 2% of the total loan) for advance&#13;
procurement and retroactive financing of logistical inputs for Orissa's Reform Implementation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
Organization, essential consulting services and electricity meters, from November 1, 1994. This&#13;
would extend the standard 12 month retroactive financing period up to 20 months. Such advance&#13;
procurement was necessary to enable Orissa to effectively initiate the implementation of its power&#13;
sector reform program. Retroactive financing is subject to submission of standard documentation&#13;
and withdrawal applications to the Bank.&#13;
4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION&#13;
Executing and Operating Agencies&#13;
4.1    Under Orissa's power sector reform program, the state government's and OSEB's power&#13;
sector operations were transferred on April 1, 1996 to the two utilities, GRIDCO and OHPC,&#13;
effective from April 1, 1996, the start of India's fiscal 1997. They are described in Chapter 2 and&#13;
are discussed in more detail in Annex 2.4 (OHPC) and Annex 2.5 (GRIDCO).&#13;
4.2   GRIDCO is responsible for transmission and distribution and would be the executing&#13;
agency of Parts A and B of the proposed project. Orissa's transmission facilities including those&#13;
to be developed under the project would be operated by GRIDCO. Distribution facilities&#13;
including those to be developed under the project would be gradually transferred to private&#13;
distribution companies.&#13;
4.3    OHPC is responsible for the operations and maintenance of the existing hydroelectric&#13;
plants taken over from the state government and OSEB and for the Upper Indravati project.&#13;
4.4   Part C of the project provides implementation support to GRIDCO and OHPC, and policy&#13;
support for the reform program and capacity building of GRIDCO, OHPC, and the Regulatory&#13;
Commission (Annexes 2.3-5). Under Part C of the proposed project, technical assistance would&#13;
help GRIDCO and OHPC refine their organizational structure; develop and introduce financial,&#13;
personnel, and management systems; and develop staff capacity needed to make the power&#13;
companies viable corporate entities (Annex 4.1-2).&#13;
4.5   Staff transfer orders were issued on April 1, 1996 on as-is-where-is basis, under existing&#13;
personnel policies. They will be refined and discussed with staff in the course of 1996 for the&#13;
finalization of GRIDCO' s and OHPC's staff cadres by March 31, 1997. In the past, most of the&#13;
OSEB engineers were state government employees seconded to OSEB. GRIDCO and OHPC&#13;
officers and other staff will be employees of the companies. A five-year transition plan for staff&#13;
rationalization through retraining, redeployment and voluntary retirement is also under&#13;
preparation, with the assistance of Orissa's institutional consultants. Staff rationalization and&#13;
related support facilities and equipment would be financed under the proposed project mostly by&#13;
ODA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
4.6   At negotiations, agreement was reached that GRIDCO and OHPC will:&#13;
*  adopt their (1) employee classification, control, and appeal regulations and recruitment&#13;
and promotion regulations and (2) five-year staff transition plans by December 31, 1996;&#13;
and&#13;
*  complete the transfer of staff to their respective cadres by March 31, 1997.&#13;
Implementation of Project Components&#13;
PartA&#13;
4.7   GRIDCO, which would be responsible for the implementation of Part A of the proposed&#13;
project, has established a Project Management Unit (PMU) to coordinate day-to-day&#13;
implementation. As the distribution privatization program (Annex 2.3) proceeds, selected sub-&#13;
transmission and distribution activities and related project implementation responsibilities may&#13;
also be transferred to the new private distribution companies.&#13;
4.8   Given the significant increase in transmission and distribution investment in Orissa, the&#13;
Orissa government and GRIDCO have agreed to engage consultants and POWERGRID to help&#13;
implement Part A of the project as GRIDCO's Engineer. PMU will use staff drawn from both&#13;
GRIDCO and its consultants for the preparation of project reports, tender documents (including&#13;
technical specifications), bid evaluation and the supervision of project implementation. (Terms of&#13;
reference are given at Annex 4.3).&#13;
4.9   In 1994, OSEB engaged POWERGRID to help implement the transmission lines&#13;
associated with the Upper Indravati project. POWERGRID was subsequently invited to join the&#13;
PMU to assist with procurement and with the supervision of project implementation.&#13;
Construction will be done by contractors under large supply and installation contracts.&#13;
Procurement has already started under advance procurement action.&#13;
4. 10 The implementation of Part A would start with GRIDCO's proposed 220 kV and 400 kV&#13;
double-circuit transmission lines (including optical fibre ground wire and related substations) from&#13;
Duburi to Paradeep, Brajarajanagar to Bolangir, and Meramandali to Bidanasi to Chandaka at an&#13;
estimated cost of US$65 million. The Bank has reviewed and approved these transmission line&#13;
projects. Additional transmission and distribution projects would be proposed to the Bank during&#13;
project implementation. The Bank would approve funding on the basis of project reports&#13;
prepared by GRIDCO with the assistance of its consultants during project implementation.&#13;
Distribution projects submitted for funding could be either GRIDCO's or those of the new private&#13;
power distribution companies to be established under the reform program. Criteria for eligibility&#13;
(Annex 4.4) include technical feasibility and project justification, environmental assessment&#13;
(including rehabilitation and resettlement if any, though none is currently expected), statement&#13;
about clearances, and financing plan.&#13;
Part B&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
4.11  The implementation of the metering program has started under advance procurement and&#13;
the first proposed contract awards have already been cleared by the Bank. Installation will be the&#13;
responsibility of the suppliers. GRIDCO's consultants will assist in further bid evaluation and&#13;
implementation supervision.&#13;
4.12 Other demand-side management investments would be implemented by GRIDCO with the&#13;
assistance of consultants being engaged under Part C. In addition, a power utility would be&#13;
engaged under Part C to help GRIDCO implement and operationalize the load research program.&#13;
4.13  Investments would be undertaken either by GRIDCO (charged through monthly electricity&#13;
bills or leased separately) or by the electricity end-users (to provide the necessary flexibility for&#13;
GRIDCO to respond to its clients' requirements). Funding would be provided under the loan and&#13;
channeled through GRIDCO, or in the case of larger individual projects, possibly directly by the&#13;
Orissa government. In case of onlending of Bank funds by GRIDCO, a project implementation&#13;
agreement acceptable to the Bank would be a condition of Bank support. Demand-side&#13;
management projects below a threshold value of US$200,000 would not require prior approval by&#13;
the Bank, but would have to meet specified eligibility criteria, to be reviewed by the Bank during&#13;
project supervision. GRIDCO has established a demand-side management steering committee&#13;
chaired by its chairman and managing director to oversee the implementation of the demand-side&#13;
management program. The Orissa chapters of the National Productivity Council, Confederation&#13;
of Indian Industries, and the Chamber of Commerce are represented on the steering committee.&#13;
The Bhubaneswar Branch of the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) is also represented&#13;
and is expected to participate in the program as a cofinancier and appraiser of lessees and&#13;
borrowers, that is, end-users. Its participation would also facilitate the promotion of the demand-&#13;
side management funding facility.&#13;
Part C&#13;
4.14  The two main consulting services assignments under the reform program began in 1994.&#13;
The Reform Consultant - a UK/US/Canadian/Indian consortium of management, financial,&#13;
economic, legal, regulatory, power and environment consultants - was engaged in September&#13;
1994 under Cr. 1356-IN. The consortium is led by KPMG Management Consulting and&#13;
McKenna from United Kingdom. NERA (UK and United States), Monenco-Agra (Canada), and&#13;
DCL (India) are members, along with several individual consultants from other firms from all four&#13;
countries. Monenco was also engaged in late 1994 under an ADB technical assistance grant for&#13;
long-term investment planning for the Orissa power system.&#13;
4.15  A British consortium of management, financial, and technical consultants - led by Price&#13;
Waterhouse and including Merz MacLellan and Northern Electric - was engaged by ODA in late&#13;
1994 to supply institution-building support to GRIDCO and later to OHPC. Their work is being&#13;
closely coordinated with the overall reform program and arrangements for close interaction with&#13;
the Reform Consultant have been put in place (Annex 4.2). ODA is in the process of recruiting&#13;
consultants for OHPC for the environmental management and for GRIDCO for project&#13;
management, environmental management and the demand-side management assignments. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
training program for GRIDCO and OlPC will be managed by Price Waterhouse, for the&#13;
Regulatory Commission by the Reform Consultant.&#13;
Project Monitoring and Implementation Review&#13;
4.16 GRIDCO and OHPC, with the help of their consultants, would implement the project&#13;
Implementation would be monitored by the Orissa government and closely reviewed by the Bank&#13;
(Annex 4.5). Implementation review missions would monitor Orissa's progress in the&#13;
implementation of its power sector reform program and compliance with its own policy statement&#13;
(para. 2.7).&#13;
4.17  In view of the nature of the reform program it supports, the project would require much&#13;
more time than is standard at the Bank for supervision. It is estimated to require about forty staff&#13;
weeks a year in the first two years, reducing gradually thereafter. In the first three years, the&#13;
project would be reviewed in depth annually, the third review being designated a mid-term review&#13;
of the proposed project. Part of this intensive supervision effort would be carried out by the&#13;
consultants first engaged by the Bank to review the original reform program in early 1994, who&#13;
have continued to assist with sector reform implementation and project preparation.&#13;
4.18  GRIDCO would submit to the Bank quarterly progress reports covering the work of the&#13;
PMU, procurement, physical progress of project components, disbursements, technical assistance&#13;
and various administrative and financial aspects of the project. GRIDCO and OHPC would also&#13;
subrmit quarterly information to the Bank, on receivables against supply of power, age-analysis of&#13;
receivables, commercial payables, and cash-flow statement. Every six months (at the end of June&#13;
and December), the Bank would receive information on key financial indicators. The formats for&#13;
these reports have already been submitted to the Government of Orissa. GRIDCO and OHPC&#13;
would also furnish to the Bank annual financial and audit reports (paras. 4.19-20 and Annex 2.5).&#13;
Project Accounts and Audit&#13;
4.19  GRIDCO and OHPC would establish separate accounts for the project to be maintained in&#13;
accordance with the commercial accounting system defined in the Companies Act. The Special&#13;
Account would be maintained by the Government of India in accordance with appropriate&#13;
accounting practices.&#13;
4.20  At negotiations, agreement was reached that the Government of India will:&#13;
* Have the records and accounts for the project and those for the Special Account for each&#13;
fiscal year audited in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied,&#13;
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
* Furnish to the Bank as soon as available - but in any case not later than six months after&#13;
the end of each year - the report of such audit by said auditors, of such scope and detail&#13;
the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by said auditors as to&#13;
whether the statements of expenditure submitted during such fiscal year, together with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to&#13;
support the related withdrawals.&#13;
5.   PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
Benefits of Power Sector Reform&#13;
5.1   By implementing power sector reform, Orissa can make its utilities commercially viable&#13;
and attractive to capital financiers, private sector as well as official donors. Investments in the&#13;
reform program are designed to go well beyond closing today's power gap. They would create&#13;
the basis for sustainable future growth of the system. The Reform Implementation Organization&#13;
has projected the Orissa power system to be able to reduce the current shortages rapidly and be&#13;
able to meet projected electrical energy requirements as soon as the distribution weaknesses are&#13;
addressed under the program.&#13;
Benefits to Consumers and Orissa Economy&#13;
5.2   Closing the chronic gap between power demand and supply will benefit all electricity&#13;
consumers. Industrial consumers in particular will benefit from the improved quantity, quality and&#13;
reliability of their power supply, since they account for the majority of consumption and bear the&#13;
brunt of load shedding and other failures of supply. The Orissa government expects the state's&#13;
improved power supply outlook to attract additional industrial investment and encourage existing&#13;
industries to expand their production facilities. This expectation is fully in line with national&#13;
surveys where industrialists consistently rate power supply as one of their most critical&#13;
constraints. The benefits of projected additional supply have been conservatively quantified in the&#13;
economic analysis and demonstrated to exceed the costs of the program by a comfortable margin&#13;
(paras. 5.14-18 and Annex 5.1).&#13;
Environment&#13;
5.3   The overall environmental impact of the reform program is expected to be significantly&#13;
positive. Higher electricity tariffs and improved metering and collection will encourage electricity&#13;
conservation. Orissa's existing thermal generation will be renovated and new capacity will be&#13;
constructed and operated by private utilities in accordance with modern practices and national&#13;
environmental standards (which are in line with Bank standards). Both major ongoing thermal&#13;
projects in Orissa are being developed in accordance with Bank Group environmental standards:&#13;
NTPC's Talcher is supported by the Bank; Ib units 3-4 by IFC. Further support for Upper&#13;
Indravati's environmental and resettlement and rehabilitation aspects is proposed to be provided&#13;
under the proposed project. The proposed transmission and distribution rehabilitation, demand-side&#13;
management and technical assistance would significantly reduce power system losses and help&#13;
improve the efficiency of electricity consumption in Orissa, thereby also helping to containing&#13;
environmental emissions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Orissa Finances&#13;
5.4   By cutting subsidies and reducing public spending in an area where the private sector can&#13;
efficiently replace public investment, the power sector reform program will promote fiscal&#13;
adjustment and help reduce Orissa's deficit. Given the past large share of the power sector both&#13;
in investments and subsidy requirements, sectoral adjustment will have a significant positive&#13;
impact on the Orissa govemment finances by eliminating state subsidies to OSEB from fiscal 1997&#13;
(para. 5.6), progressively reducing (and ultimately eliminating) the need for state investment in the&#13;
power sector, and converting Orissa's financially unrewarding investments in OSEB into&#13;
profitable investments (in terms of dividends and debt service) in GRIDCO and OHPC. The&#13;
overall impact of these measures would be to reverse the net flow of funds as of fiscal 1998 (para.&#13;
5.8). Power sector reform would therefore help reduce the Orissa government's fiscal deficit (a&#13;
problem not adequately addressed in India's macroeconomic reform program).&#13;
5.5   Power accounted for about 20 percent of Orissa's Seventh plan fiscal 1985-89 investments&#13;
and about 26 percent of its Eighth plan (fiscal 1992-97) investments. This puts it second only to&#13;
irrigation. But after the implementation of the reform program, power sector investments in&#13;
Orissa would be made from internal cash generation by the new corporations and using funds&#13;
raised from private investors, other commercial sources, co-financiers, and funds onlend by the&#13;
Government of Orissa (including the proposed Bank loan). In the Ninth Plan (fiscal 1998-2002)&#13;
power sector investments are expected to be well below 10 percent of Orissa's total and to be&#13;
eliminated altogether once the new corporations are fully privatized.&#13;
5.6   State subsidies provided to OSEB to enable it to meet its financial targets (including&#13;
covenants under Cr. 1356-IN) have grown steadily to take up an increasing share of the&#13;
Government of Orissa's resources. Fiscal 1993's power subsidies (about Rs 0.8 billion) accounted&#13;
for almost 40 percent of Orissa's total budgeted subsidies. In fiscal 1994, the power subsidy&#13;
(including the balance of fiscal 1993 requirement) was about Rs 2.0 billion, due to the need to&#13;
clear the state subsidy backlog and make up for the write-off of uncollectable accounts receivable,&#13;
which had accumulated over the years. By contrast, estimates for fiscal 1995 indicate that OSEB&#13;
covered its costs, although it still required a subsidy of some Rs 0.3 billion to meet its financial&#13;
objectives. The five tariff adjustments implemented in 1992-95 will eliminate the need for these&#13;
subsidies from fiscal 1997.&#13;
5.7   The impact of the reform program on Orissa's state finances goes well beyond the&#13;
elimination of subsidies and reduction in state funding for the sector. Although the Govemment&#13;
of Orissa will have to provide equity financing to GRIDCO up to fiscal 1999, such outflows will&#13;
be smaller than debt service, dividends, and electricity duty inflows from the utilities (Annex 5.2).&#13;
The power sector will therefore become a net source of funding to the state, from fiscal 1997.&#13;
Annual net inflows to the state would approach US$70 million equivalent in the fiscal 2001-03,&#13;
excluding the privatization proceeds which are expected to be substantial over the years. The&#13;
impact of onlending Bank funds would initially be revenue neutral (outflows to utilities are&#13;
reimbursed by the Bank through the central Govemment) and would become another source of&#13;
revenue after project completion, since Orissa's borrowing terms from the Govemment of India&#13;
are more favorable than its lending terms to the utilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
Impact on the Poor&#13;
5.8   The proposed project is not directly targeted to the poor, and its main direct poverty&#13;
consideration is related to electricity pricing. While Orissa's electricity pricing policy emphasizes&#13;
cost recovery, the utilities would continue to provide low-cost (life-line) rates for poor electricity&#13;
consumers to ensure that service for basic household uses of electricity remains affordable. It&#13;
must also be recognized that while a more commercial approach to sector development may result&#13;
in investment plans with more modest system expansion targets than what is commonly evident in&#13;
SEBs' plan across India, what actually gets implemented on the ground by GRIDCO and its&#13;
distribution successor organizations is likely to far exceed what OSEB would have been able to&#13;
actually execute in the coming years. The reform program would indirectly help the poor by&#13;
freeing up state funding (as elaborated above) for higher priority use in the social sectors. Most&#13;
importantly, by improving the power supply, the program will eliminate one of the most serious&#13;
constraints to higher economic growth. Orissa is a poor state even in the Indian context and&#13;
poverty is wide-spread. In the long term, its eradication is fundamentally dependent on growth&#13;
and employment, the state's direct poverty alleviation interventions notwithstanding. These&#13;
indirect impacts are regarded to be more important in Orissa, where connection rates are still low,&#13;
in rural areas well below 20 percent of households, and the poor typically do not have a power&#13;
connection. The key contribution of power reform to the poor is to lift the burden the power&#13;
sector has placed on the state government finances (which mostly these poor indirectly have to&#13;
bear) and simultaneously remove the power supply bottleneck to economic activity and growth.&#13;
The Specter of a Future with No Power Sector Reform&#13;
5.9   Project justification has so far focused on the benefits of the proposed reform program and&#13;
on comparisons to the program's total estimated cost. This is a conservative measure of the&#13;
project's real overall impact. For without power sector reform, any expansion of generation&#13;
capacity in Orissa - beyond the possible eventual completion of the Upper Indravati Project -&#13;
would be highly unlikely. In the absence of the reform program, even the Government of India&#13;
counter-guarantees and IFC support for the Ib unit 3-4 would have been unlikely. While NTPC&#13;
might possibly have taken over OSEB's Talcher in exchange for the electricity OSEB could not&#13;
pay for, additional NTPC generation would be diverted to paying clients and away from Orissa.&#13;
5.10 Transmission and distribution rehabilitation would also not be possible in the absence of&#13;
the proposed Bank loan to finance it. OSEB might have been able to retain the on-going support&#13;
through the PFC, but continued compliance with the OFAP and therefore continued access to&#13;
PFC funding in the absence of reform would have been doubtful at best.&#13;
5.11  Tariff reform - including bulk of the adjustments already implemented since 1993 - would&#13;
not have materialized without the prospect of sector reform. OSEB would therefore not have&#13;
covered its cost of operations, nor been able to raise funds from intemal cash generation to devote&#13;
to future investment. Without improved billing and collection discipline, OSEB would have&#13;
continued to accumulate arrears, and at best, system losses would remain at the 45 percent level&#13;
of the early 1990s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
5.12  In summary, without a complete power sector overhaul, electricity consumers in Orissa&#13;
would face a scenario of deteriorating power supply, increasing average unit costs and higher&#13;
costs to the state government - a scenario not unlike that facing several other Indian states in the&#13;
coming years. The increasing burden of the power sector on the Orissa government finances,&#13;
moreover, would further constrain state funding available for other priority investments, adversely&#13;
affecting the development of the state far beyond any direct economic effect caused by the&#13;
deteriorating power supply and resultant loss of investment and production.&#13;
5.13   Comparing the benefits of the proposed reform project to this admittedly speculative&#13;
prospect of no power sector reform, its justification is far stronger and its estimated economic&#13;
returns far higher than those derived against the estimated costs of the program alone. This does&#13;
not mean that there would be no losers under the program. Consumers presently enjoying free if&#13;
unreliable electricity they steal from the system will more often have to pay for electricity, at&#13;
increasing rates. Some utility staff will see a corresponding decline in their total earnings, and&#13;
some may opt for voluntary separation. Except where workers are affected or terminated because&#13;
of theft of electricity, these people would be compensated under the program. OSEB staff and&#13;
their labor unions have generally acknowledged that the current system cannot continue and - so&#13;
long as a large-scale retrenchment can be avoided - cautiously support the program. The political&#13;
burden of OSEB's poor performance and a genuine desire for Orissa's development explain the&#13;
wide political support enjoyed by the program once the initial visionary go-ahead signal was given&#13;
by Orissa's chief minister in 1993. It is appropriate to conclude by reiterating that the poor and&#13;
the environment are beneficiaries, not among the losers, under Orissa's power sector reform&#13;
program.&#13;
Economic Viability&#13;
5.14   The economic rate of return (ERR) was calculated on the basis of the incremental cost and&#13;
benefit streams associated with the fiscal 1997-2003 time-slice of Orissa's investment program.&#13;
Tariff revenue is regarded as the minimum measure of actual benefits, since tariff revenue reflects&#13;
only a portion of the total benefits of electricity supply. Yet even with this conservative, revenue-&#13;
based benefit valuation, the ERR for the program is about 14 percent.&#13;
5.15   A more accurate valuation of the economic benefits of electricity supply was also carried&#13;
out. Shares of replaced use were established for alternative sources of energy (diesel generation,&#13;
diesel pumping, and kerosene lighting) and energy consumption induced by the availability of&#13;
electricity were established for major consumer categories. Induced consumption was then valued&#13;
by estimating the consumer surplus - the difference between what the consumers would be willing&#13;
to pay for electricity and what they actually pay - and adding that to the tariff revenue. The&#13;
replaced use of alternative sources was valued in terms of economic resource cost savings. Using&#13;
this analysis, the project's base-case ERR was established at about 17 percent.&#13;
5.16  Finally, an analysis was carried out in which the economic value of electricity supply was&#13;
based on more conservative estimates of the consumers' surplus. This analysis is yielded an ERR&#13;
of about 14 percent. Excluding the consumer surplus entirely, on the other hand, yielded an ERR&#13;
of about 13 percent (Annex 5. 1). These results incidentally confirm that electricity is projected to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
be priced appropriately under the reform program. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness, as&#13;
the summary of results in Table 5.1 readily indicates.&#13;
Table 5.1. Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analyses&#13;
(percentage)&#13;
1. Base case                                                 16.8                      14.5&#13;
2. Transmission and distribution                              16.4                     14.2&#13;
investment up by 10 percent&#13;
3. System loss reduction decelerated                          15.8                     13.7&#13;
(losses up by 10 percent)&#13;
4. Generation down by 10 percent                              15.4                     13.2&#13;

6. Scenarios two through four combined                        14.1                     12.0&#13;
7. Scenarios two through five combined                        12.5                      6.3&#13;
a. Benefits valued at economic replacement cost and willingness to pay.&#13;
b. Benefits valued at tariff revenue.&#13;
5.17   Changes in the costs of the investment program and in the implementation schedules of its&#13;
individual components would not significantly affect the economic viability of the present time&#13;
slice. The impact on the program of lower than projected generation due to lower-than-projected&#13;
demand or somewhat slower than projected loss reduction performance is similarly not&#13;
threatening. A reduction in demand growth would affect the timing of new projects but not that&#13;
of generation projects within the present time slice (Upper Indravati and Ib units 3-4). For&#13;
despite problems with implementation, these projects would be needed in the system even before&#13;
their current commissioning dates. The transmission and distribution rehabilitation program is&#13;
also urgently required, and only the timing of transmission lines directly associated with new&#13;
generating stations would need to the adjusted.&#13;
5.18   The critical role of proper electricity pricing is confirmed in this sensitivity analysis. Cases&#13;
where tariff revenue - rather than willingness to pay - is used as a measure of benefit, show how&#13;
the returns drop sharply if tariffs are not properly adjusted. Tariff reform is one of the key&#13;
elements of the reform program and the Regulatory Commission is expected to authorize&#13;
adjustments and enable utilities meeting its performance standards to earn reasonable returns. It is&#13;
evident, as the results summarized in Table 5.1 readily demonstrate, that the investment program&#13;
is viable, economically attractive and robust to changes; as long as the underlying reform program&#13;
continues to be implemented. These results are linked to qualitative risks and safeguards below.&#13;
Risks and Safeguards&#13;
5.19   The major project risk is its direct dependence on Orissa's political willingness and&#13;
capability to implement the reform program. The government and OSEB have so far&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
demonstrated strong commitment to the program by implementing difficult and typically&#13;
unpopular measures by raising tariffs, improving collection and lowering subsidies, and are now&#13;
actively pursuing privatization. These are concrete signs that Orissa has embarked towards a&#13;
primarily commercial behavior in power sector management and operations. As long as the key&#13;
elements of the reform program proceed as planned, the project and Orissa's overall power sector&#13;
investment program remain viable under a wide range of implementation difficulties (Table 5.1).&#13;
Should the reform program collapse, inter alia resulting in minimal tariff adjustments, stagnation&#13;
of distribution rehabilitation, loss reduction and revenue collection, and further slowdown of&#13;
investments, the economic viability of the investment program would also be threatened - and its&#13;
financial viability would disappear.&#13;
5.20  The implementation of the reform program has continued after a change of state&#13;
government in March 1995, demonstrating its political support in Orissa, and the wide recognition&#13;
of the need for a fundamental change in the state's power sector. The new state government&#13;
quickly reviewed and adopted the program, as evidenced by the submission of a formal statement&#13;
of its power policy in April 1995 (para. 2.7). The commitment was demonstrated in a most&#13;
concrete fashion by the November 1995 tariff adjustment, Central government clearance and State&#13;
Assembly approval of Orissa Electricity Reform Act, and the transfer orders under the new Act on&#13;
April 1, 1996. Therefore, given the outlook for reasonable electricity tariffs and the interest&#13;
already expressed by various reputable private investors to take over existing assets and invest in&#13;
new developments, successful reform is feasible though by no means guaranteed.&#13;
5.21   Orissa's capability to develop and manage the two new utilities and the regulatory&#13;
commission is a major project risk. Appropriate management arrangements and safeguards&#13;
against future government interference are key features of project design (Annex 5.3). Orissa has&#13;
acknowledged that while technical skills are readily available, the required management expertise&#13;
is in short supply. Therefore, the boards of directors of GRIDCO and OHPC include several non-&#13;
government part-time directors and outside functional directors as well, for financial, commercial&#13;
and human resource areas. The government invited to GRIDCO's board two individuals who&#13;
were instrumental in the initial institution building of POWERGRID, for ready access to that&#13;
highly relevant experience. A comprehensive range of external support has also been engaged.&#13;
While a variety of problems will continue to be faced in the reform process, the new entities with&#13;
their outside directors and external support are expected to be able to meet the challenges and&#13;
maintain reform momentum.&#13;
5.22  The Bank intends to continue its current close involvement in the implementation of the&#13;
power sector reform program through intensive supervision and its active dialogue with&#13;
cofinanciers to help Orissa secure their continued support for the program. Continued Bank&#13;
support would inter alia depend on the state allowing persons it has appointed to manage&#13;
GRIDCO and OHPC and to lead the Regulatory Commission independently in accordance with&#13;
the state's power sector policy statement. The Bank would have remedies under the loan&#13;
agreement to deal with noncompliance with this policy statement or failure to meet other&#13;
commitments; moreover, the Bank has an established track record in Orissa of using such&#13;
remedies, including the cancellation of Ln. 2278-IN in 1991 and the suspensions of Cr. 1356-IN&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
on three different occasions. The emphasis will, however, be on helping Orissa face both the&#13;
expected and unforeseen challenges in reform implementation in particular at times of trouble.&#13;
5.23   Given the fundamental structural changes involved, the reform program's implementation&#13;
necessarily entails a number of financial, commercial and institutional risks. These have been&#13;
analyzed and appropriate safeguards have been built in to the project design (Annex 5.3). The&#13;
project's main financial and commercial risk relates to tariff reform and the utilities' ability to&#13;
recover charges from their clients. Special attention has been paid to ensure that power&#13;
distribution, the foundation of the sector, will be developed commercially, with arrangements in&#13;
place to ensure satisfactory attention to loss reduction and revenue recovery. This will be&#13;
accomplished essentially by transferring responsibility for distribution to specialized private&#13;
companies whose survival depends on their success in addressing Orissa's current problems in&#13;
distribution. To minimize the initial operational complexities during the transition from a state&#13;
controlled monolith to decentralized market structures, GRIDCO, in addition to being the grid&#13;
company (a transmission company and coordinator of system operations) will initially also be&#13;
responsible for central power procurement.&#13;
5.24  Proven technologies will be used throughout the project, which does not therefore pose&#13;
any particular technical risks in implementation or operation. Sensitivity analysis has established&#13;
that the impact on the ERR brought about by a combination of substantial adverse changes would&#13;
be acceptable (Table 5.1) with appropriate pricing of electricity by the Regulatory Commission.&#13;
5.25   Legislative risks at central and state levels have been mitigated by securing the&#13;
Government of India clearance for Orissa's reform legislation and by Orissa enacting the&#13;
legislation. Through its broader policy dialogue with India, moreover, the Bank continues to&#13;
emphasize the role of the Central Govemment in state power restructuring. The Govemment of&#13;
India is expected to provide political leadership and support to reforming states, undertake the&#13;
reforms required at the central level to pave the way for state power reform, and encourage&#13;
parallel reform initiatives in other states besides Orissa.&#13;
&#13;

case not later than six months after the end of each such year, the report of such&#13;
audit by said auditors of such scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably request,&#13;
including a separate opinion by said auditors as to whether the statements of&#13;
expenditure submitted during such fiscal year together with the procedures and&#13;
intemal controls involved in their preparation can be relied upon to support the&#13;
related withdrawals (para. 4.20).&#13;
6.2   Agreements were reached at negotiations that:&#13;

Specific Financial Objectves to be Achieved by GRIDCO and OHPC&#13;
6.3    Agreements were reached at negotiations that:&#13;
(a)    OHPC will take all such measures (including adjustments of the level and structure&#13;
of its tariffs) and conduct its operations and affairs in such manner as to achieve:&#13;
(1) in fiscal 1997, revenues from all sources related to operations and non-&#13;
operating income sufficient to cover all expenses related to operations (including&#13;
administration, adequate maintenance, taxes, payments in lieu of taxes, adequate&#13;
depreciation and other non-cash operating charges and interest and other charges&#13;
on debt, and (2) in each subsequent fiscal year such rate as may be permissible&#13;
under applicable Government of India notifications (Annex 2.4, para. 14).&#13;
(b)    GRIDCO will take all such measures (including adjustments of the level and&#13;
structure of its tariffs) and conduct its operations and affairs in such manner as to&#13;
achieve: (1) in fiscal 1997, revenues from all sources related to operations and net&#13;
non-operations' income sufficient to cover all cash expenses related to operations&#13;
(including administration, adequate maintenance, taxes, payments in lieu of taxes,&#13;
and interest and other charges on debt); and (2) in fiscal 1998 a rate of return on&#13;
its capital base of not less than 10 percent and in each subsequent fiscal year such&#13;
rate as may be permissible under the Electricity Act or prescribed by the&#13;

(c)    OBPC and GRIDCO will from fiscal 1998 not incur any debt unless a reasonable&#13;
forecast of their revenues and expenditures show that their estimated net revenues&#13;
for each financial year during the term of the debt to be incurred would be at least&#13;
1.5 times their estimated debt service requirements in such year on all their debt,&#13;
including the debt to be incurred (Annex 2.4, para. 15 and Annex 2.5, para. 18).&#13;
(d)   OHPC and GRIDCO will from fiscal 1997 maintain accounts receivable at a level&#13;
not exceeding two months average billing, and accounts payable not exceeding&#13;
two months equivalent of purchases (Annex 2.4, para. 15 and Annex 2.5, para.&#13;
21).&#13;

five-year financial projections, including their investment programs and financing&#13;
plans, for Bank review and comments (Annex 2.4, para. 16 and Annex 2.5, para.&#13;
22).&#13;
(f)    OHPC and GRIDCO will from fiscal 1997 (1) have their records, accounts, and&#13;
financial statements (balance sheets, statements of income and expenses, and&#13;
related statements) audited for each fiscal year, in accordance with appropriate&#13;
auditing principles consistently applied by independent auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Bank; and (2) furnish to the Bank as soon as available, but in any case not later&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
than six months after the end of each such year, (i) certified copies of their&#13;
financial statements for such year as so audited; and (ii) the report of such audit by&#13;
said auditors of such scope and in such detail as the Bank may reasonably request&#13;
(Annex 2.4, para. 17 and Annex 2.5, para. 24).&#13;
Disbursement Conditions&#13;
6.4   Agreement was reached at negotiations that disbursements for Part A of the Project will&#13;
commence after:&#13;
(a)   One distribution area has been placed under a lease/management contract&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 2.18).&#13;
(b)   The Regulatory Commission has been formally established in a manner satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank (para. 2.13).&#13;
Selected Reform Milestones&#13;
6.5   Agreements were reached at negotiations that:&#13;

and OHPC will offer them for sale to the public in accordance with a program and&#13;
timetable satisfactory to the Bank (paras. 2.15 and 2.20).&#13;
(c)   GRIDCO will gradually transfer its distribution system to private distribution&#13;
companies in accordance with a program and timetable satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
(para. 2.15).&#13;
Recommendation&#13;

ORISSA POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
AN OVERVIEW OF THE INDIAN POWER SECTOR&#13;
Organization and Regulation&#13;
1.    Responsibility for the electricity supply in India is shared constitutionally between the&#13;
central government and the states. The Electricity Act of 1910 provided the initial legal&#13;
framework that still today govems the operations of licensees, that is, the existing private utilities.&#13;
As amended, the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948 provides the overall regulatory framework for&#13;
the sector, charging the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) with developing a national power&#13;
policy and with planning, coordinating, and regulating sector development. The 1948 Act also&#13;
empowers the central government (currently the Ministry of Power) to make rules for carrying&#13;
out CEA' s objectives by means of notification in the Official Gazette. The 1948 Act created the&#13;
SEBs and entrusted them with primary responsibility for public power supply as well as for&#13;
related state-level regulation. The boards were envisioned as largely self-governing entities&#13;
empowered to set tariffs and monitor licensees. But after the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956&#13;
defined the aspects of generation and distribution that were the exclusive responsibility of the&#13;
states, the once-significant role of private utilities gradually diminished. Today, following the&#13;
1991 amendments, it is recognized that various sections of the 1948 and 1910 Acts could be&#13;
modernized, but there are no fundamental legal obstacles preventing private investment from&#13;
entering into the sector.&#13;
Central Sector&#13;
2.    Since the 1970s, the central government has been actively involved in power development&#13;
in India to complement the efforts of the states. The Government of India currently owns several&#13;
generating companies (including the National Thermal Power Corporation, NTPC, and the&#13;
National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, NBPC) and the new national transmission company&#13;
and grid operator, the Power Grid Corporation of India (POWERGRID). These utilities were&#13;
incorporated under the Companies Act.&#13;
3.    The Ministry of Power (MOP) approves tariff-setting principles for the centrally-owned&#13;
entities. Tariff proposals are reviewed by the Central Electricity Authority which then sends them&#13;
to the MOP for notification. Tariffs are determined on a cost-of-service basis and are subject to&#13;
basic performance standards. The utilities' financial viability is ensured to the extent that their&#13;
tariff revenues cover operational costs, including debt service. The Government of India also&#13;
owns two power sector financial intermediaries, the Power Finance Corporation and the Rural&#13;
Electrification Corporation.&#13;
4.    The Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources administers the Government's&#13;
renewable energy program, which seeks to meet the decentralized energy needs of rural areas to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1. 1&#13;

supplement conventional power supply with such alternative energy sources as mini-hydro,&#13;
biomass, wind and solar-power systems. The Government provides budgetary resources for&#13;
demonstration projects and promotes private investment through various fiscal incentives, while&#13;
the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) provides institutional financing.&#13;
State Sector&#13;
5.    The states own the SEBs and State Generating Companies, which together generate&#13;
almost 70 percent of India's electricity supply and provide most of the distribution to consumers.&#13;
The 1948 Act explicitly requires the SEBs to operate "in the most efficient and economical&#13;
manner" and mandates that they adjust their tariffs to achieve a minimum retum, after interest, of&#13;
3 percent on net fixed assets in operation. The Act, however, allows a state to specify a higher&#13;
return target for its SEB than the statutory minimum return. Further, it specifies that interest on&#13;
loans from the state governments is to be paid by the SEBs only after meeting the minimum&#13;
return. States are, in fact, required to provide subsidies to help the SEBs meet the minimum&#13;
return requirement, by compensating the SEBs inter alia for low tariffs to residential consumers&#13;
and for using the SEBs as administratively convenient vehicles for agricultural input subsidies.&#13;
6.    For most SEBs, meeting the statutory 3 percent after-interest return would cover&#13;
operating costs and debt service provided state government subsidies were fully paid on time and&#13;
bill collection were reasonable. Because of their poor operational performance, low tariffs, and&#13;
inadequate subsidies, however, most SEBs do not reach the Act's statutory minimum returns.&#13;
Their aggregate operating losses are in fact rising, and operating deficits and capital expenditures&#13;
are presently financed by borrowing or from state budgetary resources.&#13;
Private Utilities&#13;
7.    At independence private utilities and licensed local authorities together provided about 80&#13;
percent of India's public electricity supply. But when their licenses expired, most licensees were&#13;
taken over by the SEBs, in line with the 1956 Industrial Policy Resolution. Today, only five of&#13;
the private utilities originally licensed under the 1910 Electricity Act remain: Bombay Suburban&#13;
Electric Supply (BSES) and Tata Electric Companies (TEC) in Bombay, Ahmedabad Electricity&#13;
Company (AEC), Surat Electric Company, and Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation (CESC) in&#13;
Calcutta.&#13;
8.    Then in 1991 India reversed its long-standing policy on private investment in the sector.&#13;
Power was removed from the list of activities reserved for the public sector in the Industrial&#13;
Policy Resolution, and the 1948 Act was amended to lift many of the regulatory disincentives to&#13;
private investment in the power sector. These changes were fully consistent with the Government&#13;
of India's objective to tap the financial, technical, and managerial capabilities of the private sector&#13;
in areas previously restricted to the public sector.&#13;
9.    India now allows full local or foreign private ownership of power companies and offers a&#13;
thirty-year license with the prospect of twenty year renewals and increased financial returns.&#13;
Provision is also made in the 1948 Act for private generating companies and captive plants to sell&#13;
power to the SEBs. Additional incentives were introduced in the Government of India budget for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
fiscal 1994 included reducing the import duty on power projects to 20 percent and offering new&#13;
private power projects a five-year tax holiday.&#13;
Grid Operations&#13;
10.   Indian utilities are grouped into five regional interconnected power systems in the Eastern,&#13;
Northern, North-Eastern, Southern, and Western regions of India. In 1964 the Government of&#13;
India created Regional Electricity Boards to bring the state boards together with the central and&#13;
joint sector utilities to coordinate system operations in their respective regional grids. It also&#13;
entrusted the Central Electricity Authority with the development and operation of Regional Load&#13;
Dispatch Centers to support the regional boards. In 1991, an amendment of the 1948 Act&#13;
strengthened the authority of the Regional Electricity Boards by requiring generating companies&#13;
and licensees to follow their instructions.&#13;
11.   In 1993, under the POWERGRID System Development Project (Ln. 3577-IN), the central&#13;
government agreed to transfer the Regional Load Dispatch Centers and their operational&#13;
responsibilities from the Central Electricity Authority to POWERGRID. The transfer program&#13;
was implemented on schedule and completed in January 1996. POWERGRID, in cooperation&#13;
with the SEBs and with Bank support, is implementing projects to develop modern coordination&#13;
and control systems for the Northern and Southern regions. It has also prepared similar projects&#13;
for the Eastern, Western, and North-Eastern regions, all expected to go into implementation in the&#13;
course of 1996. A recently-completed study confirmed the need for further improvements in the&#13;
structure of bulk power and transmission tariffs, and work on the recommended modifications has&#13;
began under an action plan approved by the central government as agreed under Ln. 3577-IN.&#13;
Electricity Supply, Demand, and Retail Tariffs&#13;
12.   As of March 1995, India's power system had an installed capacity of about 81,000 MW&#13;
(comparable to that of France), of which about 26 percent hydroelectric and the balance thermal,&#13;
mostly coal fired. In fiscal 1995, this system generated about 351,000 GWh of electricity, with&#13;
about 77 percent by thermal plants and about 23 percent by hydroelectric power. In fiscal 1982&#13;
installed capacity was only 32,350 MW and generation 114,000 GWh, but while system capacity&#13;
has expanded rapidly, supply continues to lag behind demand.&#13;
13.   Along with the growth of supply, the availability and operational efficiency of India's&#13;
generation plants has also improved, further increasing their overall annual output, or their plant&#13;
load factor. These improvements reflect a strengthening of plant operations and maintenance and&#13;
are particularly commendable in view of the deteriorating quality of the coal supply.&#13;
Improvements, however, have been uneven among the SEBs, with most being attributable to the&#13;
National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), which currently provides about 30 percent of&#13;
India's thermal power supplies. NTPC's operational efficiency and plant load factor consistently&#13;
surpass that of most state utilities by a wide margin. But power station auxiliary consumption in&#13;
India still exceeds 10 percent and technical and commercial losses in transmission and distribution&#13;
are excessive. Officially reported at 22 percent of net generation, actual system losses are of the&#13;
order of 30-40 per cent for most SEBs. The official 22 percent represents a reasonable estimate&#13;
of the technical losses, but ignores the commercial losses including theft.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
Tariffs and Consumption&#13;
14.   India's industrial and commercial sectors consume about half of all its generated electric&#13;
power, agriculture reportedly uses over a quarter; and residential consumption, various public&#13;
services, and other miscellaneous groups account for the balance. In fiscal 1995, average retail&#13;
tariff revenue was about Rs 1.33 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), up significantly from about Rs 1.05&#13;
per kWh in fiscal 1993, showing the impact of central government pressure on the states to raise&#13;
tariffs. But increases in real costs, particularly for fuel and wages, have largely offset the&#13;
increases in plant efficiency and real tariffs. Average tariff revenue therefore still remains below&#13;
actual costs, estimated at about Rs. 1.60 per kWh for fiscal 1995, and at about half of the revenue&#13;
that would result from pricing based on the long-run marginal costs.&#13;
15.   Tariff differentials among consumer groups have widened. Rates to industrial consumers&#13;
have been raised and are in most states well above actual cost of supply, in fact close to, and in&#13;
some cases even above, long-run marginal costs. Average industrial tariff revenue in fiscal 1995&#13;
was about Rs. 2.12 per kWh. Agricultural tariffs have fallen in real terms, and at an estimated&#13;
average of Rs 0.22 per kWh for fiscal 1995, cover less than a fifth of actual costs and less than 10&#13;
percent of long-run marginal costs. Compounding the problem is the utilities' poor collection rate&#13;
from farmers and high transmission and distribution losses for rural supply. A similar situation&#13;
applies to the residential use of electricity, where tariffs are typically heavily subsidized and -&#13;
particularly in urban areas - meter-tampering and other forms of electricity theft are widespread.&#13;
16.   Low power tariffs have fostered wasteful end-use of energy and increased demand in the&#13;
residential and agricultural sectors. Most strikingly, agriculture's share in total consumption is&#13;
reported to have grown from about 17 percent in fiscal 1982 to about 28 percent in fiscal 1995.&#13;
Along with increases in average revenues, structural improvements in electricity tariffs and&#13;
improved metering are essential across India to contain cross-subsidies and promote more&#13;
efficient use of electricity.&#13;
17.   But while subsidization, flat tariff rates, and unmetered supplies have undoubtedly&#13;
accelerated the agricultural and residential use of electricity, many states are also suspected of&#13;
substantially overstating unnetered sales as a way to avoid reporting increasing system losses&#13;
from non-technical factors and chronic under-investment. Instead of admitting increasing system&#13;
losses including theft, most states prefer to report increasing sales to agriculture, a priority sector&#13;
across India.&#13;
Supply Outlook&#13;
18.   Power shortages today are estimated at about 10 percent of total electrical energy and 20&#13;
percent of peak capacity requirements and are likely to increase in the coming years in several&#13;
parts of India. Financial constraints will keep generation capacity additions during the Eighth Plan&#13;
(fiscal 1993-97) to less than 20,000 MW, as compared to the original 48,000 MW capacity-&#13;
addition requirement. The Ninth Plan (fiscal 1998-2002) projected capacity additions from&#13;
conventional sources at about 57,000 MW. This, however, is highly unlikely to be achieved&#13;
because of financing constraints and the long gestation period for power projects in India.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1I.1&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
19.   India's power generation is largely coal based, and over a half (about 30,000 MW) of the&#13;
proposed Ninth Plan addition is to be provided by coal-fired plants. India's dependence on coal-&#13;
based power development is justified in terms of coal resources and economics of indigenous&#13;
coal-mining and power generation. But environmental considerations (including ash disposal) will&#13;
affect the pace and restrict the siting of coal-based power development. The capacity of India's&#13;
coal sector would also be severely strained to produce the additional coal required. Fundamental&#13;
issues in the coal sector (including the productivity, pricing, and profitability of indigenous&#13;
mining; environmental management; resettlement and rehabilitation; private sector participation&#13;
and coal import policy) are being addressed by the central government and Coal India Ltd. under&#13;
the proposed Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project to help improve the quality and increase the&#13;
quantity of coal supply to public and private sector generators for the future.&#13;
20.   India presently has few alternatives to a coal-based power development strategy.&#13;
Hydroelectric power development will continue to be constrained by inter-state water issues and&#13;
environmental and resettlement considerations. The long gestation period of hydroelectric&#13;
projects, that succeed in obtaining the required elaborate agreements and clearances and actually&#13;
go into construction, makes achieving the additional 19,000 MW projected in the Ninth Plan&#13;
virtually impossible. The increase in gas-based power generation is slowed by lack of resource&#13;
development. Until large-scale gas import projects materialize, it will also be constrained by the&#13;
limited natural gas reserves.&#13;
21.   India's renewable energy program is among the most active in the world. Progress is&#13;
being made in such areas as wind, solar-photovoltaic, bagasse and biogas, and mini-hydroelectric&#13;
energy generation. As an example, as of October 1995, India had about 650 MW of installed&#13;
wind-power capacity and another 200 MW under construction. The renewable resources&#13;
program is supported by several donors, including the Bank Group under the Renewable&#13;
Resources Development Project (US$115 million under Cr. 2449-IN), and a grant from the&#13;
Global Environment Facility (US$26 million). As of December 1995, IREDA had provided&#13;
funding for over 600 renewable energy projects. But while yielding encouraging and locally&#13;
significant results and contributing to India's power supply, renewable energy will not be able to&#13;
cover India's projected energy supply shortfall in the foreseeable future.&#13;
22.   It can also be argued that India does not actually need to add the 57,000 MW as projected&#13;
for the Ninth plan, since demand could be contained by more realistic pricing and other demand-&#13;
side management measures (improvements in the performance of existing capacity and reductions&#13;
in system losses are included in the government's estimate). The Bank's 1991 study of long-term&#13;
issues in the power sector estimated that by fully implementing various measures to improve&#13;
electricity end-use efficiency, as much as 30 percent of maximum demand and 20 percent of&#13;
electrical energy could theoretically be saved over time. More meaningful for the short-term, the&#13;
study estimated that raising electricity tariffs to long-run marginal cost levels over five years&#13;
would reduce demand for generation capacity by about 8,700 MW (or about 10 percent of the&#13;
power demand estimated for the end of the Ninth Plan).&#13;
23.   Some progress can reasonably be expected in the coming years. Electricity prices to&#13;
industrial and commercial customers are already high, and pressures to improve productivity -&#13;
including the more efficient use of electricity - have increased rapidly under the Government's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1. I&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
economic liberalization program. India's increasingly competitive business environment is also&#13;
expected to cause companies to pursue low-cost conservation measures more aggressively.&#13;
Time-of-day pricing needs to be introduced to provide an incentive to shift loads to off-peak&#13;
periods. But companies often defer the substantial investments typically required to gain more&#13;
substantial savings, preferring rather to invest in expanding their production facilities. As long as&#13;
the low and heavily subsidized residential and agricultural tariffs and relaxed bill collection&#13;
practices continue, little progress can be expected in these consumer sectors. The realization of a&#13;
significant part of the theoretical maximum savings arrived at in the 1991 Bank study would&#13;
require the majority of the states to implement the kind of power sector reforms that are being&#13;
pursued in Orissa. But the current outlook suggests that most states in India will not be able to&#13;
apply this option in the near term, pointing to worsening power shortages in the next few years.&#13;
State Electricity Boards&#13;
24.   The SEBs' lack of autonomy and the poor revenues from politically-inspired tariffs have&#13;
weakened them to the point of operational and financial crisis. Aggregate financial subsidies&#13;
received by the agricultural and residential consumers - conservatively defined as the difference&#13;
between actual tariffs and the tariffs required to recover actual cost of supply without cross or&#13;
state subsidies - amounted to about US$4.6 billion or 1.6 percent of India's 1996 GDP. Almost&#13;
80 percent of this windfall goes to agriculture, and the balance goes to residential consumers.&#13;
25.   Subsidies - which the states provide the SEBs as a (vastly insufficient) compensation for&#13;
unrealistically low retail tariffs - have stagnated in rupee terms since fiscal 1992 reflecting the&#13;
states' fiscal constraints. In fiscal 1996 state electricity subsidies amounted to the equivalent of&#13;
about US$600 million or about 0.2 percent of GDP leaving the SEBs to bear a deficit of about&#13;
US$4.0 billion of the US$4.6 billion subsidy the SEBs provided to agricultural and residential&#13;
sectors. Cross subsidies from industrial and commercial consumers provided the SEBs with about&#13;
US$1.8 billion (about 0.6 percent of GDP), reducing their 1996 commercial losses to about&#13;
US$2.2 billion (about 0.8 percent of GDP).&#13;
26.   When estimated as the difference between revenue from tariffs set to enable the sector to&#13;
operate commercially (defined here as earning returns high enough for the utilities to be able to&#13;
attract and service debt and equity raised from capital markets) and actual tariffs, aggregate&#13;
financial subsidies to agriculture and residential sectors exceed 2 percent of GDP. In addition to&#13;
low tariff rates, SEBs' poor bill-collection performance (partly due to political pressures)&#13;
subsidizes consumers still further, which in turn further undercuts the SEBs' financial position.&#13;
Together the commercial losses of the SEBs, state power subsidies, and investments in power&#13;
account for about 4 per cent of India's GDP and are almost entirely financed through central and&#13;
state budgetary resources. Successful state power sector reform could therefore significantly&#13;
reduce the claims of the power sector on fiscal resources and directly strengthen India's public&#13;
finances, along with its positive indirect fiscal impact through removing power supply bottlenecks&#13;
to increase industrial development and economic growth.&#13;
27.   Non-performing SEBs' burden on the Indian economy, moreover, is even higher than&#13;
revenue and cost indicators suggest. The poor quality and reliability of the power supply take an&#13;
additional toll on the current operations and expansion plans of industry, constraining industrial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1. 1&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
development and economic growth. Given the poor financial position of the SEBs and the limited&#13;
capacity and willingness of central government to provide guarantees, there is little prospect that&#13;
in the absence of state power reform, private investment in generation will materialize anywhere&#13;
near the levels needed to close the gap between projected demand in India and today's public&#13;
sector supply.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
ORISSA POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
BANK EXPERIENCE IN THE INDIAN POWER SECTOR&#13;
1.    Over the last decade and up to the early 1990s, IBRD followed a three-pronged strategy&#13;
in its lending to the power sector in India. Firstly, it supported agencies owned by the&#13;
Government of India, the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) in particular, as a means&#13;
of effecting sector-wide improvements. Secondly, it financed a selected number of state&#13;
electricity boards (SEBs) whose management and state governments appeared to be committed to&#13;
improving their performance. Finally, and in close cooperation with IFC, it financed existing&#13;
private power utilities and encouraged the Government to lower entry barriers for new investors.&#13;
The success of this strategy has been uneven, reflecting fundamental sectoral weaknesses.&#13;
Operations with central sector and private utilities have been generally successful. Despite some&#13;
progress, SEBs in general did not respond to the Government's initiatives, and up to 1993 there&#13;
was no effective mechanism to enforce compliance or elicit cooperation, even in case of non-&#13;
payment for central sector electricity. It has become painfully clear that a sustainable solution to&#13;
the sector's problems will have to focus on SEBs, instead of attempting to resolve the power&#13;
crisis only through central or private sector generation capacity additions.&#13;
2.    Experience from NTPC and POWERGRID Operations. Project completion reports and&#13;
the Performance Audit Reports l recognize the achievements and success of NTPC in project&#13;
implementation. Despite delays in the pre-construction stages, NTPC generally completed the&#13;
projects on schedule and within budget, reflecting the strong project management capability it has&#13;
developed. Quality control procedures introduced by NTPC helped improve the quality standards&#13;
of power equipment supplied by Indian manufacturers. NTPC has grown rapidly into a 15,625&#13;
MW generation company. As NTPC's operational performance exceeds the SEB average by a&#13;
wide margin, its impact shows in power generation statistics as an overall sectoral improvement.&#13;
Not surprisingly, NTPC has not in the past inspired fundamental improvements in the SEBs. This&#13;
was somehow expected in the 1980s, without granting NTPC a mandate or mechanism to even&#13;
try to achieve such results. A substantial part of the latest loan, Ln. 3632-IN approved in June&#13;
1993 for the NTPC Power Generation Project, has been committed. Notwithstanding generally&#13;
satisfactory progress in the Environmental Action Plan under that project, problems are still being&#13;
experienced in the implementation of NTPC's new resettlement and rehabilitation policy&#13;
particularly in the Singrauli area. NTPC is taking remedial actions to address the problems. The&#13;
Bank's initial experience with POWERGRID is virtually identical, reflecting the strong influence&#13;
of NTPC in its project management and implementation systems and the transfer of most of its&#13;
key personnel from NTPC. While POWERGRID struggled to launch the delayed Northern&#13;
Region Transmission Project (Ln. 3237-IN) taken over from NHPC and CEA, it has recently&#13;
I  The latest OED Performance Audit Report, No. 10854, was issued in February 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1.2&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
awarded contracts committing the major part of the loan, bringing its implementation in line with&#13;
the POWERGRID System Development Project (Ln. 3577-IN) approved in March 1993.&#13;
3.    Bill collection has been a persistent problem. NTPC and POWERGRID have only&#13;
recently been able to meet their two months account accounts receivable covenant, first&#13;
introduced for NTPC under Ln. 2555-[N in 1985. Intensified collection efforts and central&#13;
appropriations (direct payments by the Government from central assistance intended to the&#13;
concerned states) have reduced accounts receivable and further improvements have been achieved&#13;
after the adoption of NTPC's and POWERGRID's new investment and commercial policies as a&#13;
result of a prolonged dialogue with the Bank during the preparation of Ln. 3577-IN and Ln.&#13;
3632-lN. After initial hesitation in applying the new policies and under consistent Bank pressure&#13;
(including an informal suspension of disbursements under Bank loans to NTPC and&#13;
POWERGRID in early 1994), supply restrictions have been applied by NTPC and/or&#13;
POWERGRID in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in the Northern region, all three states (Bihar,&#13;
Orissa and West Bengal) in the Eastern region and Andhra Pradesh in the South. The overall&#13;
collection performance has improved and has been generally satisfactory since mid-1994, though&#13;
problems with a few individual states including Uttar Pradesh continue.&#13;
4.    As of March 1996, NTPC's accounts receivable, net of central appropriations, were at&#13;
about 2.5 months. Excluding tariff disputes (in arbitration since mid-1994), this comes down to&#13;
2.0 months. POWERGRID has collected its current bills, after a difficult start, remarkably well&#13;
since early 1994, and such receivable as of March 31, 1996 were at about 1.9 months. Its overall&#13;
accounts receivable position is, however, still unsatisfactory at about 4.4 months. This is due to&#13;
unresolved bill disputes (also in arbitration since mid-I 994) and extraordinary delays in&#13;
Government tariff notifications, which add 0.8 months and 1.7 months, respectively, to the 1.9&#13;
months of current receivables. The implementation of Rihand II power station extension project,&#13;
approved for funding under Ln. 3632-IN, has been deferred by NTPC, in line with the new&#13;
investment policy. The main reason is the unsatisfactory accounts receivable position and&#13;
continuing tariff disputes with the Uttar Pradesh State Electricity Board (UPSEB), the state in&#13;
which the plant is to be located and its main beneficiary. The appraisal of the proposed&#13;
POWERGRID II has been deferred by the Bank, inter alia pending resolution of the tariff&#13;
disputes and notification of new tariffs. Umpires appointed by the Government to arbitrate the&#13;
disputes are expected to issue their long-awaited rulings in May 1996.&#13;
5.    Experience with SEBs. Beginning in the mid-I 980s, IBRD attempted to improve the&#13;
performance of SEBs by direct involvement at the state level. This approach, involving close&#13;
lending relationships with the SEBs, has generally been unsuccessful. Projects with institutionally&#13;
and financially weak SEBs have not met expectations (beyond their physical construction&#13;
activities). This has forced the Bank to apply increasingly strong remedies, including suspension&#13;
of disbursement and subsequent cancellations of loans to the Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking&#13;
(DESU), the states of Karnataka, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh, and formal threat of suspensions of&#13;
loans to the states of Himachal Pradesh and Kerala. The Bank's stance yielded positive responses&#13;
from some of the concerned state governments at the time of acute crisis, including substantial&#13;
tariff adjustments in Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh, but most of the SEB&#13;
operations have not resulted in any measurable sustained improvements in performance. More&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1.2&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
fundamental reforms in the structure and management of the sector, along the lines outlined in&#13;
para. 1.21 of the main text, are therefore necessary for future Bank state-level power operations.&#13;
6.    Experience with Private Utilities. The Bank's and IFC's experience with India's private&#13;
utilities has been generally satisfactory. Unlike the SEBs, private utilities have been allowed by&#13;
their respective state governments to operate autonomously and in a technically and financially&#13;
viable manner. They have not suffered from the financial problems of the central government-&#13;
owned entities either. The power they generate is largely fed into their own distribution networks&#13;
which supply financially lucrative urban residential and industrial consumers in India's major&#13;
cities. This experience validates the Government's and the Bank Group's current strategy on&#13;
improving power sector performance in India through wider private sector participation. It is&#13;
also equally clear that a sustainable solution to the sector's problems will have to focus on&#13;
resolving the problems of the SEBs and therefore involve power distribution. Private sector&#13;
participation in power distribution is essential and has to be a key feature of any state power&#13;
sector reform program seeking Bank support. This will not be easy to implement. The concerned&#13;
state governments have authorized the existing private utilities to charge their consumers tariff&#13;
rates higher that those of the SEBs in the respective states. Extending private distribution outside&#13;
India's main cities will have to be accompanied by similar action, higher and differential tariff&#13;
rates, in line with the power supply and consumer mix of each distribution company. Recent&#13;
experience with the Noida Power Corporation (NPC), a small new private distribution utility in&#13;
Uttar Pradesh, has quickly demonstrated that a state government's requirement for NPC to adopt&#13;
UPSEB's unrealistically low tariff rates in order to maintain uniform retail tariffs in Uttar Pradesh&#13;
make profitable operations impossible without subsidies by the SEB or state government.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
ORISSA POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
POWER SECTOR REFORM AND COMMITMENT LENDING&#13;
1.    The actions of the Government of India, through NTPC, POWERGRID and PFC, the&#13;
opening the sector to private investment and the new state power sector restructuring program&#13;
demonstrate a clear commitment to reform. The Government's program supports policies for&#13;
effective institutional, regulatory and financial reform in line with the guidelines for Bank lending&#13;
to the power sector in the 1992 policy paper, "the World Bank's Role in the Electric Power&#13;
Sector". The following paragraphs measure the Government's reforms against those guidelines&#13;
and discuss ongoing and planned Bank support for the reforms at the center and at the state level&#13;
in that context.&#13;
2.    Transparent Regulation. India has in place, in its 1910 and 1948 Electricity Acts, a&#13;
workable regulatory framework for the sector. The Government has shown its willingness to&#13;
modify the regulatory framework, particularly to make private investment in the power sector&#13;
more attractive. CEA's involvement in regulating private power is slowly evolving towards a&#13;
more appropriate lighter regulatory review, particularly in projects awarded through competitive&#13;
procedures as against MOUs, to ensure that normative ceiling costs (rather than detailed&#13;
normative technical parameters) are not exceeded. The maximum value of projects exempted&#13;
from CEA review has already been progressively increased from Rs 250 million in 1991 first to Rs&#13;
1,000 million and in January 1996 to Rs 4,000. CEA is progressively giving up its operational&#13;
responsibilities as the regional load dispatch centers are transferred to POWERGRID and is de-&#13;
emphasizing its role in supervising project implementation, to focus on regulatory functions. CEA&#13;
has also helped set the new tariffs for NTPC and POWERGRID. GOI hesitates to reduce its&#13;
own involvement in regulatory matters better suited to be handled by an autonomous regulator, an&#13;
upgraded CEA and/or a new agency with a sharply-focused regulatory duty as compared to&#13;
CEA's broad range of responsibilities. However, it is state-level regulation that should be tackled&#13;
as a matter of highest priority.&#13;
3.    In practice the state governments do not allow the SEBs to operate with the autonomy&#13;
provided by the 1948 Act and state-level regulation is characterized by heavy state government&#13;
control and intervention and lack of transparency. There are no easy answers and experience&#13;
from other countries does not provide a one-and-only direction: solutions adopted elsewhere&#13;
range from heavy regulatory processes with independent regulatory authorities (e.g., United&#13;
States), to reliance on competition with either light incentive regulation (e.g., United Kingdom) or&#13;
mainly a threat of government regulatory intervention (e.g., Finland, New Zealand) with&#13;
operational and financial autonomy of the utilities. The proposed project addresses these issues in&#13;
the state of Orissa and sets a model for state-level regulatory framework tailored for Indian&#13;
conditions, which other reforming states are already examining for possible application, on a&#13;
state-by-state basis. The Orissa model may be eventually adopted nation wide, through a national&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1.3&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
amendment to the Electricity Act, but this is likely to be a time-consuming process due to the&#13;
need to reach a national consensus before such an amendment can be enacted.&#13;
4.    Commercialization and Corporatization. The centrally-owned entities in the power sector&#13;
are all incorporated under the Companies Act and already enjoy reasonable autonomy in decision&#13;
making and day-to-day operations. The main challenge is the application of the commercial&#13;
policies recently granted by the Government to the central agencies. The process of establishing&#13;
commercial contracts between the SEBs and the central utilities is cumbersome, but progress is&#13;
being made with Bank support under Ln. 3577-IN and Ln. 3632-IN. NTPC's new bulk power&#13;
purchase agreements with the SEBs are equivalent to the PPAs negotiated with private&#13;
generators. Efforts are also being made under these operations to improve NTPC's and&#13;
POWERGRID's access to domestic and international capital markets. The dialogue on the&#13;
commercialization and corporatization of the activities currently performed by SEBs continues&#13;
with GOI and several states. The Bank in its future operations under the state power sector&#13;
restructuring program will seek to support these and other states who wish to restructure their&#13;
power sectors. The proposed Project addresses these issues in the state of Orissa.&#13;
5.    With the establishment of POWERGRID, India has taken an important strategic step&#13;
towards a functioning national power grid with an increasingly competitive and coordinated&#13;
generation and transmission system. The emerging industry structure would consist of: (a)&#13;
competing central, state and private generating companies; (b) POWERGRID as the national grid&#13;
company; and (c) state and privately-owned distribution. Long-term prospects also include power&#13;
imports from Nepal. SEBs are likely for the time being to remain integrated state-level utilities,&#13;
but are expected to focus more on distribution and, with POWERGRID's assistance, on trading&#13;
and improved coordination of their system operations. Power purchases from central sector&#13;
utilities (NTPC in particular) and competitive procurement of private generation would account&#13;
for a steadily increasing share in their overall supply. Most private power projects are expected to&#13;
be focused on one state. A few large generation projects may be developed, with the assistance&#13;
of POWERGR1ID, for sale of power to several clients in different states and regions. One such&#13;
project has been proposed to be located in Orissa. The involvement of POWERGRID, beyond&#13;
transmission service, in the facilitation of such mega power projects is being supported under Ln.&#13;
3577-IN. As a result the commercial pressures on the SEBs would increase as generators (both&#13;
private and public) focus their investments and operations to serve financially viable and&#13;
commercially disciplined clients and divert supplies from non-performers; at the same time&#13;
generating companies would have to increasingly compete to sell their output to the performing&#13;
SEBs.&#13;
6.    Private Investment. India, unlike most developing countries, has a few large private&#13;
utilities which have operated successfully for decades. The Bank has been actively involved, in&#13;
close cooperation with IFC, in supporting their investment programs. The opening of the power&#13;
sector for new private developers has resulted in tremendous business development activity. IFC&#13;
supports private generation projects in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Tamil Nadu. Studies&#13;
supported by the Bank under the state power sector restructuring program address privatization&#13;
issues and options. The proposed project addresses private power issues in the state of Orissa&#13;
and involves the privatization of Orissa's distribution system. The Bank has also supported the&#13;
implementation of the new policy under the Second Maharashtra Power Project (Ln. 3498-IN,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1.3&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
approved in June 1992) by helping Maharashtra develop its private power policy and negotiate&#13;
contracts with private developers for major power generation projects. Similar activities are&#13;
currently carried out in Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, financed by two Japan PHRD&#13;
grants and the Technical Assistance Project for Private Power Development (Ln. 3630 -IN,&#13;
approved in June 1993) to provide the central and state governments and the concerned entities&#13;
the required specialized expert services to help resolve the remaining policy, regulatory and&#13;
administrative issues and assist in project preparation.&#13;
7.    Pricing and Demand-Side Management. New two-part bulk tariffs for NTPC coal-fired&#13;
stations became effective in 1992 and POWERGRID's initial tariffs were put in place in 1993.&#13;
Further reforms in bulk power and transmission tariffs have been studied under the POWERGRID&#13;
System Development Project supported under Ln. 3577-IN. A comprehensive set of&#13;
recommendations was issued in the final report of this ADB-financed study completed in February&#13;
1994. An implementation action plan was approved by GOI in November 1994 and has been&#13;
initiated by a National Task Force, in (delayed) compliance with agreements under Ln. 3577-IN.&#13;
Its implementation will be a major challenge and will test the resolve of the Government, CEA&#13;
and POWERGRID to improving system operations. The required structural improvements&#13;
involve not only the central and private power generators and POWERGRID, but also all SEBs,&#13;
and implementation work has to proceed on a region-by-region basis.&#13;
8.    At the state level progress on tariff reform has been generally insufficient. Apart from the&#13;
need to improve cost recovery and meet financial targets, major changes are required in the&#13;
structure of the retail tariffs to contain cross-subsidies and ensure that they provide appropriate&#13;
incentives to conserve energy. Demand-Side management (DSM) is being introduced in India and&#13;
incentives for conservation are emerging with the ongoing trade liberalization, which will&#13;
introduce the required competitive pressures, and with state-by-state electricity tariff reform. The&#13;
proposed Project addresses these issues in the state of Orissa. The preparation work on similar&#13;
state power restructuring projects in Bihar, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh addresses&#13;
pricing and efficiency issues in these states.&#13;
9.    Importation of Services. As part of its liberalization program, India has opened up its&#13;
power sector to entry by foreign investors and reduced import duties on advanced technology and&#13;
mainstream equipment. The use of the Bank's standard bidding documents, initiated with&#13;
Maharashtra in 1989 and since continued with PFC, NTPC, POWERGRID and most recently in&#13;
Orissa in advance procurement under the proposed project, has encouraged competition and&#13;
exposure to foreign manufacturers, contractors and consultants. Compared to most other&#13;
developing countries, India has an abundance of educated and trained manpower and the use of&#13;
foreign consultants would mainly be required in high-technology projects (such as&#13;
POWERGRID's regional power system coordination and control investments) and preparation&#13;
and implementation of reforms under the proposed project in Orissa and elsewhere inter alia under&#13;
the state power sector restructuring program.&#13;

* Average revenue includes subsidy from GOO. In FY94 000 paid large amount of subsidy (Rs 2,260 million) to enable OSEB to make&#13;
provision for uncollectible receivables (equivalent to about 19% of revenue), and for prior period accounting adjustment arising due to GOO's&#13;
decision to charge higher price for power sales to OSEB from OO owned hydro stations.&#13;
2.      The last six years have witnessed a steady deterioration in the financial performance of&#13;
OSEB. In spite of an annual average growth of about 19% in sales revenue OSEB has not been&#13;
able to earn the statutory rate of return of 3% (after interest) on net fixed assets without subsidy&#13;
from GOO, because of its very low level of tariffs. There was no increase in tariffs from FY90 to&#13;
FY92 resulting in its inability to recover its costs. OSEB started a program to remedy this&#13;
situation four years back and has increased its tariffs by almost 67% over this period, including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
recent revision of 17% in November, 95. The level of subsidy as a percentage of revenue&#13;
increased from about 9% in FY90 to about 22% in FY95. In FY94 OSEB was able to cover its&#13;
cash operating expenses but had a small short-fall ( Rs 76 million) in meeting its debt service&#13;
requirements to non-government lenders. It improved its performance in FY95 and was able to&#13;
cover, without subsidy, its operating expenses and debt service obligations to its lenders including&#13;
the state government. Since last three years OSEB has been focusing on cleaning up its balance&#13;
sheet by making large provisions against uncollectibles accumulated over past many years. In&#13;
FY94 and FY95, subsidy was required to enable OSEB to make a large provision for&#13;
uncollectible receivables accumulated from previous years and for prior period adjustments.&#13;
Again in FY96 it is estimated that OSEB will require subsidy of Rs 3272 million because of&#13;
provision for uncollectible receivables ( Rs 1308 million); increases in rates of depreciation by&#13;
GOI effective April 94 which resulted in additional depreciation costs that could not be&#13;
immediately recovered through tariffs; increase in power purchase costs as OSEB plans to&#13;
purchase about 1000 GWh from OPGC at Rs 1.48/kWh compared to its average purchase price&#13;
of Rs 0.70/kWh; and delay in tariff revision. Another contributory factor to OSEB's weak&#13;
financial position is its high level of debt. GOO has traditionally provided funds to OSEB only in&#13;
the form of long-term loans. This has created a heavy debt service burden for OSEB as is evident&#13;
from its low debt service coverage of less than 1.0 up to FY93. Since then, its debt service cover&#13;
has improved, somewhat, but it is still not adequate.&#13;
3.    OSEB's billing and collection has also been unsatisfactory. Lack of appropriate internal&#13;
controls have adversely affected revenues. Poor accounting for sales revenues, defective and non-&#13;
functioning meters, and lack of reconciliation between financial accounts and unmetered supply to&#13;
large number of consumers obscures transmission and distribution losses. In order to understate&#13;
losses, OSEB has tended to overstate sales to some categories of consumers. Based on sample&#13;
field studies, analysis of billing data, and tariff structure, Orissa's Consultants have estimated&#13;
losses for FY96 to be about 43% compared to 24% reported by OSEB. Consequently actual&#13;
average tariff for FY 97 (before planned revision of July 1996) is estimated at Rs. 1.83/kWh&#13;
(Attachment 3). Its weak collection performance resulted in non-compliance under Cr. 1356-IN,&#13;
due to receivables exceeding the maximum level, of three months electricity sales, agreed with the&#13;
Bank. As a consequence of its poor billing and inability to collect, OSEB has not been able to&#13;
meet its obligations to its suppliers for purchase of power, fuel, and capital goods.&#13;
4.    Valuation and Transfer of Assets. Under Orissa's power sector reform program, the&#13;
power facilities previously owned by OSEB and GOO are being transferred to GRIDCO and&#13;
OHPC. Attachment 2 shows how the assets and liabilities have been split between the new&#13;
owners. GRIDCO is not only taking over all the transmission and distribution assets but also the&#13;
unpaid electricity and other receivables together with the related provision for bad and doubtful&#13;
debts. GOO has also agreed to revalue the fixed assets before transferring these to the new&#13;
companies. This is a path-breaking decision since it is the first occasion where an SEB has been&#13;
permitted to revalue its fixed assets. This will enable GOO to realize a more realistic value for its&#13;
past investments at the time of privatization. It will also help the sector, to provide more self-&#13;
financing for new investments, due to the higher depreciation which the new owners can recover&#13;
on the revalued fixed assets. This also helps eliminate GRIDCO's and OHPC's dependence on&#13;
budgetary support from the GOO. The impact of the revaluation of fixed assets on OHPC's and&#13;
GRIDCO's tariffs is discussed in Annexes 2.4-2.5.&#13;

TRANSFER OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES&#13;
EXPLANATORY NOTES&#13;
1.    Transfer of Assets: Through operation of law, GOO took over all transmission and&#13;
distribution assets, and hydro stations of OSEB at historical depreciated cost of Rs 10,362&#13;
million. It then transferred transmnission and distribution assets to GRIDCO at depreciated&#13;
replacement value of Rs 19,578 million (historical cost Rs 8,378 million). Hydro assets acquired&#13;
from OSEB ( historical cost Rs 1,985 million) and GOO's own hydro generation assets (Rs 1,581&#13;
million), have been transferred to OHPC at depreciated replacement value of Rs 11,968 million&#13;
(historical Rs 3,566 million).&#13;
2.    Capital work in progress: Valued at Rs 1,340 million, the capital work-in-progress has&#13;
been transferred to GRIDCO. Orissa Government has transferred Upper Indravati Project to&#13;
OHPC as work-in-progress at a value of Rs. 6,443 million.&#13;
3.    Long term loans: OSEB's hydro assets were financed through perpetual loans of Rs&#13;
1,861 million and Rs 767 million from other lenders ( including PFC) which have been transferred&#13;
to OHPC. GOO owned hydro stations were constructed at a cost of Rs 1,994 million against&#13;
which GOO transferred to OHPC loan liabilities of Rs 1,531 million and Rs 50 million of liability&#13;
on account of staff superannuation fund. Of the total Rs 3,392 million GOO loans, Rs 3,000&#13;
million were then converted as equity to OHPC and Rs 392 million as GOO loans of 15 years&#13;
maturity with 5 years grace period and 9.75% per annum rate of interest. Against transmission&#13;
and distribution assets GOO has transferred to GRIDCO loans taken from PFC (Rs 1,182&#13;
million); other lenders (Rs 5,530 million); and converted Rs 732 million of its own outstanding&#13;
loans into share capital.&#13;
4.    Current Assets: Stocks of Rs 30 million and Cash of Rs 44 million was transferred to&#13;
OHPC. All other current assets were transferred to GRIDCO. Against receivables of Rs 5,857&#13;
million provision of Rs 3,997 million was made by OSEB for uncollectible receivables. Out of&#13;
net receivables of Rs 1,860 million taken over by GOO it has set off arrears due form GOO&#13;
departments and undertakings against value of assets and transferred receivables to GRIDCO at a&#13;
net value of Rs 1,468 million. It is estimated that out of distribution maintenance stocks of Rs&#13;
656 mnillion, only stocks worth about Rs 150 million are usable and are therefore transferred to&#13;
GRIDCO at that value.&#13;
5.    Other Capital and Current Liabilities: Accounts payable to suppliers of Rs 20 million and&#13;
Employee terminal benefits of Rs 200 million are transferred to OHPC. All other capital and&#13;
current liabilities are transferred to GRIDCO.&#13;

1/ Explanatory Notes:&#13;
a) Because of lack of meters/defective or non-functioning meters, consumers are charged on a flat rate basis. In&#13;
absence of energy accounting, OSEB has tended to understate losses and overstate sales to certain category of&#13;
consumers. Based on sample field studies, and analysis of billing data and tariff structure the consultants have&#13;
prepared the estimates of sales and losses.&#13;
b) Average estimated tariff for FY 97, used in the analysis above, does not include proposed tariff increase of 16%.&#13;
This tariffs have been computed based on the estimated average tariffs in FY 95 and FY 96 after adjusting these&#13;
tariffs to reflect full years impact of tariff increases in July 1993 (15%), July 1994 (15%) and&#13;
November 1995 (17%).&#13;

RE: Power Sector Policy of the Government of Orissa&#13;
I have much pleasure in furnishing the following statement of the Power Sector Reform&#13;
Development Policy of the Government of Orissa (referred to as the Government in this&#13;
statement). This statement has been prepared in response to a request by the World Bank for the&#13;
Government of Orissa to reconfirm its power sector reform policies at the time of negotiations of&#13;
a proposed loan for the Orissa Power Sector Restructuring Project.&#13;
Since 1992, the Government and the Orissa State Electricity Board (OSEB) have been&#13;
taking measures to improve OSEB's operational and financial performance to enable Orissa to&#13;
attract private investment for power development. At about the same time, we began discussions&#13;
with the Bank which in November 1993 led to an agreement for the Government to implement a&#13;
comprehensive power sector reform program in order to secure the required investments. In&#13;
November 1993, the Chief Minister of Orissa confirmed the Government's commitment to power&#13;
sector reform and sought the Bank's assistance to help implement our planned reforms. The&#13;
reform program was reviewed and approved by the Council of Ministers in April 1994.&#13;
Significant progress has been achieved in implementation of the reform program. The&#13;
Government has since sought assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the UK's&#13;
Overseas Development Administration (ODA) as well, and we acknowledge the support of the&#13;
Bank in securing such assistance.&#13;
Power Sector Reform Program&#13;
As a pioneer among the states in India, the Government has embarked on a radical&#13;
program of reform, to address the fundamental issues underlying poor performance. We have&#13;
decided to restructure the state power sector and substantially privatize the power sector in&#13;
Orissa, to make power supply more efficient and to be able to meet the investment needs of the&#13;
sector. The Government's ultimate objective is to provide an appropriate policy environment for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
growth of the power sector and withdraw from it as an operator of utilities, having instead&#13;
privately-managed utilities operating where feasible in a competitive environment under an&#13;
appropriately-regulated power market. Power sector industry and market structures being&#13;
established under the reform program have been defined so as to facilitate the realization of this&#13;
ultimate objective. Significant private sector participation is to be achieved during the&#13;
implementation of the proposed Bank loan which we are seeking, to support our power sector&#13;
reform program.&#13;
Reform Program Description&#13;
The key principles of the Government's power sector reform program comprise the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a)   Restructuring of the former OSEB by corporatization and commercialization&#13;
- unbundling and structural separation of generation, transmission and distribution&#13;
into separate corporations;&#13;
(b)   Privatization - through private sector participation in the hydro generation and&#13;
grid corporation and privatization of thermal generation and distribution;&#13;
(c)   Competition - competitive bidding for new generation;&#13;
(d)   Separate Regulation - development of a power sector regulatory commission;&#13;
and&#13;
(e)   Tariffs - related electricity tariff reforms at bulk power, transmission and retail&#13;
levels.&#13;
Our policy is to separate generation, transmission and distribution and create an&#13;
independent regulatory commission; to promote competition, efficiency and transparency, and to&#13;
attract private capital for power sector development in Orissa. At the completion of the&#13;
restructuring program, a substantial private sector involvement in the sector would be&#13;
accomplished, including complete privatization of our power distribution system. Shares of some&#13;
of the new corporations would be offered also to the public, including employees, institutional&#13;
investors, and the general public through the stock market. The above key principles are more&#13;
fully described in the next paragraphs.&#13;
Restructuring of the former OSEB by Corporatization and Commercialization&#13;
The Government has consolidated hydro projects and stations of GOO's Department of&#13;
Energy (DOE) and OSEB into the Orissa Hydro Power Corporation (OHPC). Each station will&#13;
operate a profit center.&#13;
We have also established the Grid Corporation of Orissa (GRIDCO) for transmission and&#13;
grid operations, including plant dispatch in Orissa and coordination with the Eastern Region&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
Electricity Board and the Power Grid Corporation of India (POWERGRID) and the management&#13;
and privatization of new power distribution corporations. GRIDCO will also initially perform a&#13;
central power procurement function on behalf of the distribution companies.&#13;
While OHPC and GRIDCO may remain initially mainly under the Government ownership,&#13;
they will have from the beginning non-government directors (such as power, finance and industry&#13;
professionals) on their Board of Directors.&#13;
GRIDCO and OHPC will have their own cadre of staff. The Government has issued after&#13;
the due consultation with the staff, orders for transfer of its staff on deputation to GRIDCO and&#13;
OHPC. The transfer of personnel to GRIDCO and OHPC will be completed before March 31,&#13;
1997 for which the companies are preparing their personnel policies, to be finalized by December&#13;
31, 1996 and implemented by March 31, 1997. The draft five-year transition plan for the&#13;
rationalization of staff has been prepared and after consultation with the staff will be finalized by&#13;
December 31, 1996 based on an ongoing review of the age and skills profile of existing staff A&#13;
set of proposals for reducing staff to reasonable levels will be drawn up and will include estimates&#13;
of reduction in staff through attrition, voluntary retirements, retraining and transfers to other&#13;
Government bodies. Voluntary retirements/redundancies and costs including pension entitlements&#13;
will be estimated and financing set aside. We will discuss and agree the plan with the workers&#13;
before it is implemented. Retrenchment of staff will be implemented with legal and social&#13;
responsibility to the rights and dignity of affected staff, reasonable compensation will be paid to&#13;
those staff affected. Compensation payments and pension entitlements will be financed by each of&#13;
the companies, through tariffs and/or Government contributions. We also reiterate that the power&#13;
sector in Orissa is poised for rapid expansion. Therefore the seemingly redundant staff may get&#13;
adequate scope for being absorbed.&#13;
Privatization&#13;
We are committed to limiting public sector investment in generation development to&#13;
possible minority share-holdings in thermal project companies (if considered desirable to lower the&#13;
perceived risk and facilitate the transaction). The majority of funding for new generation&#13;
including OHPC's new projects should come from private sources. The possibility of further&#13;
investment in Orissa by the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), is of course not&#13;
precluded.&#13;
OHPC's shares will be offered to the public as soon as a track record required for&#13;
successful listing has been achieved, not later than March 31, 2000 according to our current&#13;
expectations. The bulk of the Government's power investments are in hydro power, and even a&#13;
minority disinvestment will enable the Government to release substantial amounts for its other&#13;
high priority development needs.&#13;
Negotiations to establish a privately managed distribution company are underway and we&#13;
expect to complete the first privatization under a management contract in mid-1 996. (We decided&#13;
not to attempt long-term privatization of the first company before the Regulator has become fully&#13;
operational and detailed information about the distribution systems to be privatized has become&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 4 of 10&#13;
available.) It is anticipated that this management contract will converted into a long-term lease in&#13;
about three years. The planned three additional distribution companies will be privatized by&#13;
GRIDCO in stages under the reform program, by the end of year 2000 at the latest though we&#13;
intend to complete the distribution privatization program earlier.&#13;
GRIDCO itself will, initially, be owned by the Government with possibility of some later&#13;
private equity participation preferably of a grid company and/or a utility with strong experience in&#13;
transmission, grid operations and power pooling. Public listing of GRIDCO's shares is scheduled&#13;
by March 31, 2001. To ensure that GRIDCO's suppliers/buyers of power can not influence the&#13;
policies, operations and business decisions of GRIDCO in their favor, no single&#13;
generator/distributor, its associates and related companies, subsidiaries etc. shall be allowed to&#13;
hold individually and collectively a controlling stake in GRIDCO's equity.&#13;
The reform program includes the divestment of a part of GOO's stake in OHPC and&#13;
GRIDCO. It is in the interest of OHPC and GRIDCO to establish track record and get&#13;
themselves listed on the stock market before significant divestment takes place. However it may&#13;
not be possible to do so before four years to five years as stated above. To initiate the process&#13;
early on, and to motivate the employees who are important stake-holders in the survival and&#13;
growth of their company, GOO considers it desirable to invite the employees of OHPC and&#13;
GRIDCO to participate in the equity of the company. GOO desires to divest about 10 percent of&#13;
its equity in OHPC and GRIDCO to the employees. In the absence of opportunities to sell the&#13;
stocks, the employees may, however, not be ready to invest till the stocks are listed on the stock&#13;
exchange. Since the Companies Act prohibits a company from buying its own shares (except for&#13;
reducing its capital) we intend to establish a self-liquidating short-term "trust" which shall buy and&#13;
sell shares of OHPC and GRIDCO, only to the employees, for the interim period before these&#13;
companies get their shares listed on the stock exchange.&#13;
Competition&#13;
Thermal generation will be developed through separate companies by the private sector.&#13;
We also plan to select sponsors through competitive bidding managed by GRIDCO, which will be&#13;
required to carefully establish the need for such capacity and then procure it with efficiency and&#13;
economy as its mandate. We also plan to seek proposals for hydro projects on the basis of&#13;
competitive procurement, subject to the need for such additional capacity and demonstration that&#13;
competitive procurement of a selected hydro. is feasible. We expect OHPC, however, to take the&#13;
lead in implementing hydro components of multipurpose hydro and irrigation, possible flood&#13;
control projects such as the ongoing Upper Indravati Project. Finally, we will pursue competition&#13;
in distribution privatization, and, to the extent possible, full-scale bidding for the remaining three&#13;
distribution areas.&#13;
Separate Regulation&#13;
An independent regulatory agency, the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission is being&#13;
established. The Regulatory Commission will be autonomous as provided for under the law and&#13;
will ensure the operational, managerial and financial autonomy of the new utilities and companies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 5 of 10&#13;
in Orissa's power sector. Enabling legislation, the Orissa Electricity Reform Act, has been&#13;
enacted with assent of the President of India and became effective from April 1, 1996.&#13;
The Regulatory Commission would consist of a Chairman and two additional members.&#13;
The commissioners' qualifications and appointment procedures and the conditions of appointment&#13;
are specified in the legislation to ensure the selection of qualified persons. The Government is&#13;
committed to allowing the new Regulatory Commission to operate with the level of autonomy&#13;
and independence provided for in the legislation. The cost of regulation will be met by the&#13;
Government.&#13;
Under the new law the Regulatory Commission has the authority to issue licenses to&#13;
GRIDCO and the future private distribution companies. Drafts of such licenses have been&#13;
prepared. The Regulator would regulate the licensees in the performance of their statutory and&#13;
license obligations. This would inter alia include: (a) the setting of retail tariffs of distribution&#13;
companies and bulk supply and transmission tariffs of GRIDCO; (b) related performance&#13;
standards in the supply of electricity, (c) performance standards in the promotion of efficient use&#13;
of electricity by consumers to be achieved by the licensees; and (d) settlement of certain disputes&#13;
between licensees and consumers. The legislation authorizes Regulatory Commission to vary the&#13;
principles to be used in regulating licensee's charges from those contained in the Sixth Schedule&#13;
of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948, most importantly the pass through of costs irrespective of&#13;
performance would not be automatic and their rate of return would not be guaranteed, but be&#13;
made conditional on performance. The Regulatory Commission need not issue licenses to&#13;
generators or directly regulate the tariffs or quality of service of generating companies operating&#13;
in Orissa. This would be accomplished through GRIDCO, which in its license would have an&#13;
obligation to contract generation with efficiency and economy and GRIDCO would not be&#13;
automatically able to pass on costs under unreasonable power purchase agreements (PPAs).&#13;
Regulatory functions will be conducted, with transparency and fairness, and with the&#13;
participation.of stakeholders and feedback mechanisms with power suppliers providing&#13;
informnation to the Regulator on their performance and costs. The Regulator is to ensure that:&#13;
(a)   utilities operating within agreed efficiency parameters earn a commercial rate of&#13;
return on the shareholders equity and are able to raise a reasonable share of their&#13;
financing requirements for future investment through internal cash generation after&#13;
meeting income tax and dividend requirements; and&#13;
(b)   the rights of all categories of consumers are protected, e.g., with respect to the&#13;
cost, efficiency and quality of service.&#13;
Tariffs, Load Management and Electricity Conservation&#13;
The Regulator will continue to implement progressive retail tariff adjustments initiated by&#13;
the Government with successive adjustments since 1992, in addition to passing through of fuel&#13;
and purchase power costs, so as to ensure reasonable rates of return and self-financing, and&#13;
improving the time-of-day tariffs to be introduced in the next tariff adjustment for large industrial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
consumers. The principles to be followed will reflect market-based tariffs based on competitive&#13;
procurement of generation and cost-based efficiency-incentives linked to tariffs for transmission&#13;
and distribution.&#13;
Bulk power purchases will be based on power purchase agreements to be signed with each&#13;
of the OHPC power plants, NTPC, OPGC and the independent power producers. Power sales by&#13;
OHIPC plants will be cost-based and linked to availability and provide incentives to OHPC for&#13;
providing availability at system peak. These costs including the costs of fuel will be automatically&#13;
passed on to consumers in the retail rates. GRIDCO's costs and those of the distribution&#13;
companies will be regulated and only costs allowed by the Regulator will be included in retail&#13;
rates charged to customers. When separate distribution companies are established, a separate&#13;
transmission tariff will be developed which will be added to the overall costs of power purchased.&#13;
This may over time lead to different retail tariffs for each distribution profit center of GRIDCO&#13;
and subsequently for each private distribution utility.&#13;
Cross subsidies may have to continue to be provided for in the retail tariff structure in the&#13;
near term, but they would be contained and limited to the truly needy. The Government will not&#13;
abandon its responsibility to protect the interests of small rural consumers and rural poor and&#13;
expects the Regulatory Commission to provide life-line rates in rural areas, while maintaining the&#13;
viability and commercial focus of all distributors. Agricultural electricity tariffs will be reviewed&#13;
by the Regulatory Commission and are expected to be revised gradually, taking into account&#13;
financial needs of utilities and economic conditions of small and marginal farmers. Lack of meters&#13;
and absence of any reasonable estimate of T&amp;D losses obfuscates the issue of subsidy, which&#13;
appears to be exaggerated since non-technical losses cannot be distinguished from unmetered&#13;
sales. Installation of meters would help in reflecting sales and losses accurately; in reducing the&#13;
losses; and in better targeting the subsidy to deserving consumers. Explicit subsidies, financed by&#13;
the Government, would be made for well-defined target groups to balance the Government's&#13;
social objectives and distributors' financial and commercial requirements. We expect, however,&#13;
the need for such subsidies to be minimal. The Regulatory Commission is expected to continue to&#13;
allow full cost recovery by the utilities, as the Government has authorized in the recent tariff&#13;
adjustments.&#13;
Electricity demand-side management policies are being articulated, with initial focus on&#13;
pricing, metering, collection and disconnection. These ongoing measures will be accompanied by&#13;
a program of load management/electricity conservation measures promoted by GRIDCO under&#13;
the reform program. Our longer term programs to promote load management and conservation&#13;
will be determined based on the results of this pilot program and we trust Bank support will be&#13;
forthcoming for their implementation even if the bulk of power sector financing is to come from&#13;
private sources and capital markets.&#13;
Environment, Resettlement and Rehabilitation&#13;
The overall environmental impact of the reform program is expected to be significantly&#13;
positive. Efficient and economic electricity tariffs and improved metering, billing and collection&#13;
will promote electricity conservation. Electric power projects in Orissa will continue to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 7 flO&#13;
implemented in accordance with applicable state and national environmental standards,&#13;
resettlement and rehabilitation and tribal development policies. Orissa's existing thermal&#13;
generation will be renovated and new capacity constructed and operated by private companies in&#13;
accordance with modem practices and applicable national environmental standards. Transmission&#13;
and distribution rehabilitation and load management/electricity conservation measures will&#13;
significantly reduce system losses, reduce the need for generation expansion and thereby also&#13;
contribute to containing environmental emissions; no environmental issues are envisaged. The&#13;
distribution rehabilitation program will also cover the appropriate handling of outdated&#13;
transformers and other potentially environmentally harmful replaced materials, if any are&#13;
discovered in the rehabilitation process.&#13;
Program Benefits&#13;
The reform program will enable Orissa to establish and develop a viable power industry,&#13;
capable of meeting Orissa's electricity needs and applicable environmental standards. The new&#13;
utilities will improve the efficiency of power supply in Orissa and close the chronic power&#13;
demand/supply gap to the benefit of all electricity consumers. Visible progress in system&#13;
improvement with Bank support under the new loan will strengthen credibility and help gain&#13;
public acceptance and support for the reform program. The program will promote fiscal&#13;
adjustment as it enables the Government to cut its power subsidies and reduce public spending in&#13;
the power sector. Finally, we are proud to state, the program is already providing a model for&#13;
state power sector reform in India. Several other states are contemplating similar reform efforts&#13;
for their power utilities and are in close touch and following the progress of our reform efforts.&#13;
The Government's electricity pricing policy for the reform program, to be implemented by&#13;
the Regulatory Commission, will continue to emphasize cost recovery. Significant adjustments&#13;
have already been implemented by the Government. As noted above, the policy will, however,&#13;
continue to provide for low-cost (life-line) rates for poor consumers in line with their limited&#13;
capability to pay for their electricity consumption, to ensure affordable service for basic household&#13;
and small and marginal farmers' agricultural uses of electricity.&#13;
Along with life-line tariff rates, the reform program will facilitate poverty alleviation in&#13;
two indirect, yet significant ways. First, the program will free up the Government funding (capital&#13;
investment and the Government subsidies) from the power sector to social sectors. The flow of&#13;
funds from the power sector to the Government will exceed the Government's inputs from FY97&#13;
onwards. Second, and even more important, the program will help the Government eliminate one&#13;
of the most serious constraints to higher economic growth in Orissa, by closing the gap between&#13;
power supply and demand and improving the quality and reliability of supply to satisfactory levels&#13;
for further industrial and other economic activities.&#13;
Progress of Reform Program Implementation&#13;
The implementation of the reform program has started and our progress has been&#13;
commended by most observers including the Bank. The success of the program is based on the&#13;
unwavering political support. Though critical, that alone of course is still only a start;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 8 of 10&#13;
implementation involves numerous details and requires a well-oiled machinery for steady&#13;
progress. A senior-level Steering Committee chaired by the Chief Secretary of the Government&#13;
has been established to provide policy guidance and monitor the implementation of the reform&#13;
program. A Task Force chaired by the Principal Secretary of the Government's Department of&#13;
Energy and a Reform Project Management Group reporting to the Task Force have been&#13;
established. They manage the program and coordinate the work of seven working groups. The&#13;
progress of the program can be attributed to the devotion and effort of these groups, which&#13;
brought together government and OSEB officials, retired OSEB employees and outside experts.&#13;
A consortium of management, financial, economic, legal, regulatory, engineering and environment&#13;
consultants (what we call the Reform Consultant) has been engaged to help the Government&#13;
implement the program. Under the reform program the Government will continue to provide&#13;
adequate funding, complementing external sources, in its annual budgets for the implementation&#13;
organization including phase 2 and 3 of the Reform Consultant's work. With the formation of the&#13;
companies most of this work is now being transferred to them. Complementary technical&#13;
assistance projects for institution building support to the new utilities and power system planning&#13;
have been initiated for which ODA and ADB support have been received. Individual investment&#13;
components under the reform program are being implemented by the concerned power&#13;
generation, transmission and distribution utilities, GRIDCO carrying the main responsibility for&#13;
implementing investments supported under the Bank loan.&#13;
The key actions already implemented and measures taken by the Government and the&#13;
reform implementation organization in each main area of the reform program are described more&#13;
fully in the following sections:&#13;
(a)   Unbundling and Structural Separation. Generation has been separated from&#13;
transmission and distribution and two new utilities, OHPC and GRIDCO have&#13;
been established complementing earlier action establishing the Orissa Power&#13;
Generation Corporation (OPGC, which has commissioned the two units of the lb&#13;
thermal project). The service area of GRIDCO has been divided into four areas&#13;
for the privatization and development of four distribution utilities. Once&#13;
completed this will leave GRIDCO in charge of transmission and system&#13;
operations and centralized power procurement for the distributors,&#13;
(b)   Reform Legislation. Enabling legislation has been enacted. The transfer of assets&#13;
includes the settlement and valuation of OSEB's accounts receivable and payable&#13;
balances, as the uncollectible receivables and overdue payables will not be carried&#13;
over to GRIDCO or the new distribution companies. While establishing the&#13;
opening balance sheets for OHPC and GRIDCO, the fixed assets of OHPC and&#13;
GRIDCO have been revalued, keeping the economic value, investment needs,&#13;
adequacy of return, as well as sensitivity to tariff in view;&#13;
(c)   Institutional Development. OHPC and GRIDCO have been registered under the&#13;
Companies Act. Their Boards of Directors and top management have been&#13;
appointed, with significant non-government representation on the two boards&#13;
reflecting the Government's commitment to the development of autonomous&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 9 of 10&#13;
commercial utilities. The development of OHPC and GRIDCO's management and&#13;
commercial accounting systems, personnel policies and other operational&#13;
procedures has started with the support of institution building technical assistance&#13;
and will continue under the reform program. The companies will have their own&#13;
personnel policies and will have full autonomy for making business decisions. The&#13;
private sector distribution companies will of course develop their own policies and&#13;
systems;&#13;
(d)   Staffing. A time-bound transition plan for the transfer of the Govemment power&#13;
staff and OSEB staff to the new corporations is under preparation, in consultation&#13;
with the labor unions and employees and with assistance of our consultants;&#13;
(e)   Regulatory Commission. Key staff of the regulatory agency have been identified&#13;
and the agency has started operations in shadow mode. Process for selection of&#13;
Commissioners has been initiated and is expected to be finalized within three&#13;
months. A set of regulations have been prepared. Soon after the commissioners&#13;
are appointed these will be finalized and placed before the state legislature;&#13;
(f)   Privatization/Pivate Sector Participation. OSEB's Talcher thermal power&#13;
station has been divested to NTPC. A power purchase agreement has been signed&#13;
and necessary security arrangements including a counter-guarantee agreement by&#13;
the Government of India (GOI) have been finalized for the development of two lb&#13;
units by a private developer for the sale of electricity to GRIDCO, financial close is&#13;
imminent. Structured negotiations for a management contract of one of the four&#13;
distribution companies have been concluded and the contract will be signed&#13;
shortly. This will provide a mechanism for testing the feasibility of private&#13;
management of distribution even before the regulatory regime is fully operational;&#13;
(g)   Competitive Bidding of New Generation. Under the reform program, GRIDCO&#13;
will contract new generation through competitive bidding procedures. Model&#13;
power purchase agreements have been prepared for both hydro and thermal&#13;
producers. Procedures for selection, qualification and evaluation of bidders are&#13;
being developed. These will be managed by GRIDCO which will ensure that&#13;
procedures for processing projects are transparent and fair to all interested parties;&#13;
(h)   Tariffs. Five electricity tariff adjustments raising average tariff revenue by about&#13;
67 percent were implemented between April 1992-November 1995. This record of&#13;
tariff decisions and implementation is unparalleled in the state power sector in&#13;
India. To continue the program of correcting the tariff distortions we are&#13;
committed to revise tariffs at appropriate level for FY 1997; and&#13;
(i)    Load Management/Electricity Conservation. Tariff adjustments, both to the level&#13;
and structure, have been and will continue to be used to promote efficient use of&#13;
electricity by the consumers. In addition, the Government has formulated and will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 10 of 10&#13;
under the reform program implement, with Bank financing and ODA technical&#13;
assistance, a program of load management/electricity conservation measues.&#13;
I trust the Bank will appreciate the depth of commitment and extend its support to reform&#13;
program implementation expressed in this policy statement. The Bank has commended our&#13;
reform efforts all along. The Government has benefited from Bank assistance in the formulation&#13;
and initial implementation of the reform program and of course, funding under the Upper&#13;
Indravati credit has been truly needed. Early new Bank funding is now needed and will help, in&#13;
addition to solidifying the reform program, enable work on the essential improvements to the&#13;
transmission and distribution systems to start at a level unprecedented in Orissa. I trust the Bank&#13;
Funding can be approved early to maintain the momentum of the Reform program.&#13;
With kind regards,&#13;
Yours sincerely,&#13;

INDIA&#13;
ORISSA POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
ORISSA'S POWER SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM&#13;
Key Features of Orissa's Power Sector Reform Program&#13;
I.    The Objectives of the Reform Program. As a pioneer among the states in India, the&#13;
Government of Orissa has decided to restructure and substantially privatize the power sector in&#13;
Orissa, to make power supply more efficient and to be able to meet the investment needs of the&#13;
sector. The Orissa government's ultimate objective is to withdraw from the power sector as an&#13;
operator of utilities, having instead privately-managed utilities operating in a competitive and&#13;
appropriately-regulated power market. Power sector industry and market structures to be&#13;
established under the reform program have been defined so as to facilitate this ultimate objective&#13;
with no further institutional restructuring. Significant private sector participation is to be&#13;
achieved under the program during the implementation period of the proposed project. The&#13;
reform program was endorsed by Orissa's Chief Minister in November 1993, formally approved&#13;
by the Council of Ministers in April 1994 and has been endorsed by the new state government,&#13;
which took office in Orissa in March 1995. GOO issued on April 20, 1995 a formal statement of&#13;
its power sector policy (an updated version is attached at Annex 2.2).&#13;
2.    The reform program was reviewed in January-March 1994 and was endorsed by a team of&#13;
consultants engaged by Bank. This independent review was considered desirable in view of the&#13;
close involvement of the Bank in the formulation and design of the program. Consultants&#13;
engaged by the Orissa government under Cr. 1356-IN in September 1994 to help implement the&#13;
program also reviewed the program at the beginning of their assignment and endorsed it,&#13;
however, with a recommendation to establish a new Regulatory Commission instead of&#13;
attempting to convert OSEB into an autonomous regulator.&#13;
3.    The Scope of the Reform Program. Orissa's power sector reform prograrn involves the:&#13;
(a) unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution, into separate services provided by&#13;
separate companies; (b) private sector participation in the new hydro generation and transmission&#13;
utilities and privatization of thermal generation and distribution; (c) competitive bidding for new&#13;
generation; (d) the development of an autonomous power sector regulatory agency; and (e)&#13;
related electricity tariff reforms at bulk power, transmission and retail levels.&#13;
4.    New Industry and Market Structures. The key elements of the program are as follows:&#13;
(a)   the Orissa Hydro Power Corporation (OHPC) took over the hydro stations of the&#13;
Orissa government and OSEB on April 1, 1996. OHPC's operations and&#13;
organization; institutional development, staffing and training; private sector&#13;
participation; investments; and finances are detailed in Annex 2.4. OHPC will be&#13;
initially owned by the Orissa government, which intends to attract private sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 2 of 15&#13;
participation in OHPC. New thermal generation will be developed by the private&#13;
sector, the first private power project is about to reach financial closure. The sale&#13;
of OSEB's only existing thermal station, Talcher, to NTPC has already been&#13;
approved. Orissa's lb units 1-2 are to be either privatized, most likely through the&#13;
sale of the majority of the Orissa Power Generation Corporation's (OPGC) shares&#13;
to private investors. OHPC and individual private generating companies will&#13;
function as generating companies under the 1948 Electricity Act;&#13;
(b)   the Grid Corporation of Orissa (GRIDCO) is responsible for transmission,&#13;
coordination of system planning and operations and, initially, distribution and bulk&#13;
power procurement. It took over these functions from OSEB on April 1, 1996.&#13;
GRIDCO is the main executing agency of investments supported under the&#13;
proposed project. Its operations and organization; institutional development,&#13;
staffing and training; private sector participation; investments; and finances are&#13;
detailed in Annex 2.5. GRIDCO has a mandate to privatize its distribution&#13;
operations in four stages, into four companies, by the end of 2000. Distribution&#13;
privatization is a key feature of the reform program and is elaborated in paras. 19-&#13;
24. GRIDCO will purchase power from OHPC and other generating companies&#13;
under power purchase agreements (PPAs) and sell in bulk to its own distribution&#13;
divisions and the new private distribution companies, which are allowed, and are in&#13;
the future expected, to buy also directly from the generators. GRIDCO will be&#13;
initially owned by the Orissa government, which intends to attract private sector&#13;
participation;&#13;
(c)   the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission will be an autonomous authority,&#13;
responsible for the regulation of the power sector. The structure selected for the&#13;
Regulatory Commission is a three-member commission with the necessary support&#13;
staff. Its objective is to help ensure the operational, managerial, and financial&#13;
autonomy of the new utilities in Orissa's power sector, to promote transparency,&#13;
efficiency, and economy; and to help Orissa attract private capital for power sector&#13;
development while safeguarding the interests of consumers; and&#13;
(d)   Reform Legislation. The Regulatory Commission has a statutory basis. New&#13;
legislation, the Orissa Electricity Reform Act 1995 (Orissa Act 2 of 1996), had to&#13;
be enacted (as described in para. 8) as the concept of a state-level Regulatory&#13;
Commission independent of the state government and power utilities does not exist&#13;
in India's power sector legislation, the 1910 and 1948 Electricity Acts, and the&#13;
fundamental statutory duties of OSEB under the 1948 Act (which include the basic&#13;
obligation to serve) and related assets have to be transferred to the Regulatory&#13;
Commission, GRIDCO and the distributors. The reform legislation: (a) established&#13;
the Regulatory Commission and defined its functions; (b) provided for the&#13;
licensing of transmission and supply of electricity; and (c) provided for the Orissa&#13;
government to restructure the Orissa power sector and to vest in companies&#13;
licensed by the Regulatory Commission certain assets, rights and liabilities of&#13;
OSEB. GRIDCO and the distributors will function as licensees under the new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 3 of 15&#13;
legislation, regulated by the Regulatory Commission in the performance of their&#13;
statutory and license obligations. Power sector regulation and the Regulatory&#13;
Commission are presented in detail in paras. 8-11, electricity tariffs are discussed in&#13;
paras. 12-14.&#13;
5.    The Rationale of Selected Design Features. The Regulatory Commission and GRIDCO&#13;
are at the center of the new industry and market structures selected under the reform program:&#13;
(a)   A New, Autonomous Regulatory Commission. Autonomy is not an end in itself,&#13;
instead, it is a means to an end. The fundamental reason for the Orissa&#13;
government establishing an autonomous Regulatory Commission is to persuade&#13;
prospective private investors that Orissa is making a credible commitment to&#13;
private ownership and operation of power sector facilities, which in turn is the key&#13;
for the sustainable financing and development of the sector (para. 18). It was&#13;
initially envisaged that OSEB be developed into a Regulatory Commission, after&#13;
the transfer of all its assets to the new utilities, in an attempt to avoid extensive&#13;
amendments to existing legislation. Orissa's legal advisers concluded, however,&#13;
that amendments were inevitable in order to adequately deal with the range of&#13;
fundamental statutory duties of OSEB, and it was therefore decided that a new&#13;
Regulatory Commission be established as legislation would have to be enacted in&#13;
any case. This approach also helps demonstrate the new direction of Orissa's&#13;
power sector policy, with OSEB no longer involved in the power sector in any&#13;
active role;&#13;
(b)    Vertical Separation. The Orissa government selected corporate unbundling, i.e. a&#13;
structure involving a separate grid company (GRIDCO) with independent private&#13;
generators (including OHPC, OPGC along with IPPs) and distributors, so as to&#13;
create a structure which is conducive to significant power development and&#13;
efficient distribution and not suspect for abuse by a dominating generation-&#13;
transmission utility. Generation was already partly separated from transmission&#13;
and distribution, as parts of Orissa's generation capacity were developed and&#13;
owned by the Orissa government and OPGC. Orissa's substantial coal reserves&#13;
and even in the national context significant potential for power development (para.&#13;
15) also influenced the choice of the industry structure, away from a structure with&#13;
a dominating integrated generation-transmission utility accompanied by&#13;
independent private distributors. Given the severe management, financial and&#13;
operational problems of OSEB, privatization without restructuring and related&#13;
regulatory reforms was ruled out as unfeasible and incapable of meeting the&#13;
objectives of the reform program;&#13;
(c)   Several Distribution Companies. OSEB has about 1.3 million consumers, and the&#13;
potential for connecting several million additional consumers in the long-term&#13;
exists, given the current low connection ratio. Orissa's population is about 34&#13;
million, 100 per cent electrification would involve about 5-6 million consumers.&#13;
Distribution rehabilitation is one of the main objectives of the reform program,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 4 of 15&#13;
given the current extremely poor efficiency of OSEB's distribution operations. The&#13;
current system even without any further growth could support a minimum of five&#13;
separate companies (a reasonable minimum size of a viable distribution utility being&#13;
about 200-300,000 consumers). The long-term prospect of substantial growth&#13;
reinforces the desirability of creating several, not just one, private distribution&#13;
companies, so as not to monopolize distribution from OSEB into one large private&#13;
monopoly. This will facilitate performance comparisons and thereby encourages&#13;
competition among the distributors and also facilitates improved information flows&#13;
and more effective regulation, which taken together are expected to contribute to&#13;
and result in better overall operational efficiency and consumer service. The&#13;
reform program involves the establishment of four distribution companies, selected&#13;
on the basis of detailed analysis of OSEB's distribution system (para. 19);&#13;
(d)   Centralized Power Procurement. Making GRIDCO initially responsible for&#13;
centralized procurement of bulk power, rather than decentralizing this&#13;
responsibility and requiring each distribution company to arrange its supplies (also&#13;
referred to as wholesale competition) and the gradual privatization of distribution&#13;
and initial reliance on GRIDCO for distribution are conscious design choices&#13;
strongly preferred in the Orissa situation over less conservative/more ambitious&#13;
(unrealistic) alternatives (such as immediate wholesale competition and immediate&#13;
privatization), to help ensure the successful implementation of the reform program&#13;
and to minimize the operational complexities during the transitional period from&#13;
the Orissa government/OSEB environment to the post-reform decentralized&#13;
industry and market structures. At a later stage, as the distribution companies&#13;
develop they will be able buy power directly from generators, after gaining the&#13;
necessary competence and confidence of suppliers (and their financiers in the case&#13;
of new generation projects) and after the necessary coordination mechanisms in&#13;
system planning and operations have been put in place; and&#13;
(e)   Retail Wheeling. The reform program also stops short of adopting retail wheeling,&#13;
one of the most advanced (and controversial) potential features of power sector&#13;
reform, adopted e.g. in the United Kingdom and pursued e.g. in the state of&#13;
California. Retail wheeling involves: (a) the separation of the supply of electricity&#13;
and its physical delivery to retail consumers; and (b) competition to supply to retail&#13;
consumers in the service areas of distribution companies, which retain the&#13;
monopoly of only the distribution function (also referred to as the wires business).&#13;
The main objectives of retail wheeling are to maximize competition in the power&#13;
sector by extending it to the supply business and thereby pressure the utilities for&#13;
the immediate elimination of cross-subsidies. While they are desirable objectives&#13;
and while competition and reduction of cross-subsidies are pursued in Orissa's&#13;
reform program, retail wheeling is regarded to be too complex for Orissa to adopt&#13;
at this early stage of development of its new industry and market structures. It&#13;
would add further risks to distributors and make distribution privatization even&#13;
more difficult than it already is in the Orissa situation, and would add further&#13;
complications to the planned gradual tariff reform.&#13;

6.    Post-reform Orissa Power Sector. The reform program is scheduled to be completed by&#13;
FY2001, with the support of the proposed project and substantial complementary private&#13;
investment: (a) the Regulatory Commission would be in its fifth year of operations and would,&#13;
having completed its initial development program, be functioning in accordance with well-&#13;
established procedures and practices. After having devoted time and resources to tariff reform&#13;
and regulation in the initial years of the reform program, the Regulatory Commission, the Orissa&#13;
government and the utilities would well before FY2001 be in a position to operate in the new&#13;
structures and regulatory regime, (b) a major transmission and distribution rehabilitation program&#13;
would be substantially completed and the power system would be operating at an acceptable level&#13;
of operational efficiency; (c) four Distribution Companies would be serving Orissa's electricity&#13;
consumers. The distributors would still be buying their power in bulk from GRIDCO, but they&#13;
and the Regulatory Commission would be starting to consider the possibilities, advantages and&#13;
risks of wholesale competition and direct procurement; (d) GRIDCO would have privatized its&#13;
distribution functions, rehabilitated its transmission system and transferred the bulk of its DSM&#13;
activities to the distributors. The focus of its operations would have shifted to grid operations,&#13;
system planning and related coordination and power procurement; (e) OHPC would have&#13;
commissioned the Upper Indravati project and rehabilitated the oldest stations in its system,&#13;
shifting its attention to new hydro development prospects, and (f) three thermal power&#13;
companies would be operating (NTPC/Talcher, OPGC/Ib units 1-2 and AES/Ib units 5-6,&#13;
respectively). The fourth thermal generating company would be about to commission a new&#13;
station, Orissa's first without a central government guarantee, and further projects would be in&#13;
various stages of planning and execution.&#13;
7.    Initial Reform Implementation Action. Orissa has demonstrated strong commitment to&#13;
the program. The Orissa government and OSEB have taken significant concrete steps to&#13;
implement the program and improve the operational and financial performance of the Orissa&#13;
power sector:&#13;
(a)   Reform Implementation Organization. The Orissa government created in early&#13;
1994 and staffed a well-structured organization to launch its reform program. A&#13;
senior-level steering committee, chaired by the chief secretary, provides policy&#13;
guidance and monitors the implementation of the program. A task force chaired&#13;
by the principal secretary of the Department of Energy and a reform project&#13;
management group reporting to the task force are managing the program,&#13;
coordinating various working groups and teams of consultants funded by the&#13;
Bank, ODA, and ADB. The tasks of the working groups are currently being&#13;
transferred to the new utilities, GRIDCO and OHPC. The building that was used&#13;
to locate the Reform Implementation Organization is being taken over by the&#13;
Regulatory Commission;&#13;
(b)   Expert Support. Under Cr. 1356-IN, the Government of Orissa engaged in&#13;
September 1994 a consortium of consulting firms (referred to herein as the Reform&#13;
Consultant) to help implement the sector reform program. ODA has approved&#13;
technical cooperation grants to support Orissa's reform program and institution&#13;
building within GRIDCO and OHPC and took over the financing of the Reform&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 6 of 15&#13;
Consultant's services in August 1995. The ADB provided complementary&#13;
technical assistance for long-term investment planning. It was completed in late&#13;
1995 and inter alia helped define Part A of the proposed Project;&#13;
(c)    Tariffs, Subsidies, Billing and Collection. The Orissa government has since 1992&#13;
authorized a series of five tariff revisions (the last in November 1995) to raise&#13;
OSEB's average tariff to the level of full cost recovery, covering OSEB's (now&#13;
GRIDCO's) operating costs and interest on borrowings. Orissa is therefore not&#13;
faced with having to implement abrupt tariff adjustments, which could make&#13;
reform politically impracticable. The Orissa government has also cleared the&#13;
backlog of subsidies that used to be required to compensate OSEB for&#13;
unremunerative tariffs and uncollectable receivables. In fiscal 1994 and 1995,&#13;
OSEB improved its bill collection close to full recovery of current bills and&#13;
reduced non-technical system losses by about 5 percentage points. The current&#13;
level, however, is still unsatisfactory, at almost 40 percent;&#13;
(d)   Privatization. The sale of OSEB's Talcher power station, Orissa's only thermal&#13;
power plant, to NTPC was approved by the Orissa State Assembly in June 1995.&#13;
Orissa is presently renegotiating the contract for lb units 5-6 with AES&#13;
Transpower. Negotiations are also underway to lease a part of OSEB's&#13;
distribution system to private sector management (para. 21);&#13;
(e)   Other Reform Implementation Milestones. In addition to the privatization and&#13;
private sector participation initiatives listed above, Orissa has incorporated&#13;
GRIDCO and OHPC, enacted the reform legislation, drafted regulations and&#13;
licenses for power transmission and distribution and PPAs for hydroelectric and&#13;
thermal projects, and prepared a grid code - thereby defining the new regulatory&#13;
and operational framework to guide operations among generators, GRIDCO, and&#13;
distributors; and&#13;
(f)    Reform Legislation, Asset Transfers and Start of Operations. Following advance&#13;
clearance by the central government, the Orissa State Assembly passed the Orissa&#13;
Electricity Reform Act of 1995 in November 1995. Formal central clearance, in&#13;
the form of the President's Assent, was obtained in January 1996 and the new law&#13;
was gazetted immediately thereafter. Assets transfers took place and GRIDCO&#13;
and OHPC became operational on April 1, 1996. The Regulatory Commission has&#13;
started operations in shadow mode. The recruitment process of its three&#13;
commissioners is underway in accordance with the provisions of the new 1996&#13;
Act.&#13;
Regulation and the Regulatory Commission&#13;
8.    The Enactment of the Reform Legislation and the Establishment of the Regulatory&#13;
Commission. Constitutional sharing of the power sector responsibility between the center and&#13;
the states requires that the reform legislation, though applicable only in Orissa, will also have to&#13;
be approved by the Government of India. This approval is formally issued as the President's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 7 of 15&#13;
Assent. A complete draft legislation prepared by Orissa was reviewed and refined in an iterative&#13;
process by the two governments. The advance clearance of the legislation by the central&#13;
government was issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs in early November 1995. With this&#13;
advance clearance, Orissa was able to formally approve the legislation on November 28, 1995,&#13;
with confidence that the required final step, President's Assent, would be obtained without&#13;
complications. The President's Assent was given in January 1996 and the Orissa Electricity&#13;
Reform Bill was gazetted in January 1996 and became effective on April 1, 1996. This legislative&#13;
process had to be completed before the Regulatory Commission can be formally established. At&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached that disbursements under Part A of the proposed project will&#13;
commence once, inter alia, the Regulatory Commission has been formally established, in a manner&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank. For the other disbursement condition, please see para. 21. The&#13;
Regulatory Commission would have substantial autonomy in approving tariffs and making other&#13;
regulatory decisions designed to encourage competition and efficient operation of the power&#13;
sector, as outlined below. The reform legislation contains several fundamental building blocks&#13;
designed to achieve autonomy. These include: (a) fixed and staggered terms for the three&#13;
commissioners; (b) their transparent selection process and qualification requirements; (c) limits on&#13;
the Orissa government's ability to remove commissioners before the end of their terms; (d)&#13;
prohibitions on current and future ties to regulated entities and restrictions on post-regulatory&#13;
employment; and (e) financing of the Regulatory Commission's operating expenses under the&#13;
consolidated fund in Orissa's budget (a privilege granted in India only to the supreme and high&#13;
courts, the election commission, and few other constitutional authorities) and their recovery&#13;
through license and other fees. These elements are intended to prevent the Regulatory&#13;
Commission from being "captured" by either the state government or the entities that are being&#13;
regulated. Autonomy does not mean the absence of accountability. The Regulatory Commission&#13;
will be accountable to the tariff standards and other obligations in the reform legislation and in the&#13;
individual operating licenses and regulations issued under the legislation. At negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached that the Government of Orissa will furnish to the Bank (1) by December&#13;
31 each year, a statement of the Regulatory Commission's estimated expenditure for the ensuing&#13;
financial year as prepared by the Commission; and (2) by March 31 each year, the Regulatory&#13;
Commission's approved budget for the ensuing financial year.&#13;
9.    The Development of the Regulatory Commission. Work to build up the Regulatory&#13;
Commission is underway. Prior to its formal establishment, the Regulatory Commission operated&#13;
in a "shadow mode", led by two shadow commissioners identified by GOO. This effectiveness of&#13;
this effort suffered, however, as the two shadow commissioners could not ultimately be&#13;
considered for regular appointment (due to age restrictions that resulted from the central&#13;
government review) and the Orissa government found it difficult to mobilize sufficient staff in&#13;
advance. Comprehensive legal, commercial and technical documents (reform legislation,&#13;
regulations and licenses, PPAs and a grid code, respectively) to set the new regulatory and&#13;
operational framework between generators, GRIDCO and distributors have been prepared by the&#13;
Reform Implementation Organization with the assistance of the Reform Consultant. During the&#13;
ongoing phase 2, technical support will be provided to the new utilities and the Regulatory&#13;
Commission under the proposed project to help operationalize these new agreements. One of the&#13;
main areas of work of the Reform Consultant under Phase 2 is the institutional development of&#13;
the Regulatory Commission and the closely related electricity tariff reform, since a new regulatory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 8 of 15&#13;
regime and tariff reform are crucial to the successful implementation of the reform program. The&#13;
Reform Consultant will help develop the Regulatory Commission, establish its work arrangements&#13;
and procedures and assist in their initial application. Inter alia the Reform Consultant will help: (a)&#13;
the Regulatory Commission develop and apply tariff setting methodology; (b) the utilities model&#13;
and develop tariff proposals; and (c) the Regulatory Commission evaluate the tariff proposals of&#13;
GRIDCO and the distributors. Study tours to and visits from other regulatory agencies in the&#13;
developed and developing world and a collaborative twinning arrangement with a regulator to be&#13;
selected will be supported under the technical assistance component of the proposed project.&#13;
10.   The Regulatory Commission will issue the licenses of GRIDCO and the distributors and&#13;
monitor the performance of their statutory and license obligations. This would inter alia include:&#13;
(a) approving the retail tariffs of distribution companies and the bulk supply and transmission&#13;
tariffs of GRIDCO, on the basis of proposals submitted by the utilities; (b) setting and monitoring&#13;
related performance standards in the supply of electricity; (c) setting and monitoring performance&#13;
standards in the promotion of efficient use of electricity by consumers to be achieved by the&#13;
licensees; and (d) resolving certain disputes between licensees and consumers. The new&#13;
legislation authorizes the Regulatory Commission to vary the principles used in regulating&#13;
licensee's charges from those contained in the Sixth Schedule of the 1948 Electricity Act. Most&#13;
importantly, the pass-through of costs would not be automatic (irrespective of performance) and&#13;
their rates of return on their capital base (shareholders' equity and reserves utilized in the&#13;
business) would not be guaranteed at a prescribed level as in the Act, but would be linked to&#13;
performance standards specified in their licenses. In line with the Act, the reference rate of return&#13;
is expected to be tied at a variable rate (currently 12%) determined by the Reserve Bank of India&#13;
(RBI). The proposed key financial covenant of GRIDCO is to be set accordingly (Annex 2.5),&#13;
with a rate of return of capital base of RBI rate plus 5%, currently 17%. Performance standards&#13;
are expected to evolve from basic loss reduction targets towards a more comprehensive set of&#13;
requirements (paras. 21-22), in consultation with the industry and other affected parties.&#13;
Requirements in the promotion of the efficient use of electricity by the consumers will similarly be&#13;
initially modest (to be realistic) and evolve over time. They will be influenced by experience in the&#13;
implementation of the DSM component of the proposed project.&#13;
11.   The Regulatory Commission need not issue licenses to generating companies operating in&#13;
Orissa or directly regulate their tariffs or quality of service. GRIDCO will have in its license an&#13;
obligation to contract generation with efliciency and economy. GRIDCO would not be&#13;
automatically able to pass on costs under its PPAs. As per Orissa's power policy statement, new&#13;
generation is expected to be procured through competition. GRIDCO will have to demonstrate&#13;
to the Regulatory Commission: (a) that new capacity is needed; and (b) that it has conducted a&#13;
fair and transparent competition to select developers for new generation projects to meet its&#13;
license requirement for efficiency and economy. The Regulatory Commission would have the&#13;
right to review the bidding documents, bid evaluation reports and contract award&#13;
recommendations, though its review would be expected to over time increasingly focus on the&#13;
competitiveness of the process rather than the details of the documents and evaluation. Several&#13;
memoranda of understanding (MOUs) are already in place, signed between OSEB and&#13;
prospective developers of private generation projects. Should GRIDCO wish to pursue some of&#13;
them, it would have to specifically satisfy the Regulatory Commission that the terms and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 9 of 15&#13;
conditions in the resulting PPAs are reasonable, i.e. meet its license requirement for efficiency and&#13;
economy in power procurement. In the absence of competitive selection of the developers, the&#13;
Regulatory Commission's review would be expected to be more exhaustive and detailed. Tariffs&#13;
of private generators will be set in accordance with applicable central government notifications,&#13;
which currently specify 16% return on equity at prescribed performance levels. The same&#13;
principles would be applied to OHPC's tariffs as well. The proposed key financial covenant of&#13;
OHPC is to be set accordingly (Annex 2.4). There may initially be some overlap in the&#13;
jurisdiction of CEA and the Regulatory Commission in the review of private generation projects&#13;
in Orissa. Demarcation lines are being reviewed and will over time become clearer, as CEA's&#13;
involvement in the review of state-level power projects not seeking central guarantees is expected&#13;
to substantially decrease and ultimately diminish. As an example, the maximum value of projects&#13;
exempted from CEA review has been progressively increased from Rs 250 million in 1991 to Rs&#13;
1,000 million and in January 1996 to Rs 4,000 million.&#13;
Electricity Tariffs&#13;
12.   Current Electricity Tariffs and Subsidies. The Orissa government is not faced with a&#13;
requirement to implement abrupt tariff adjustments, which could have made the implementation of&#13;
the whole reform program politically impossible. Instead, the program is premised in a series&#13;
of politically manageable tariff adjustments, each raising average tariff revenue well above&#13;
the rates of inflation, but acceptable within the prevailing political realities. The first&#13;
adjustment was made in April 1992, after a period of marginal annual revisions. In 1993, GOO&#13;
adopted a five-year policy of annual adjustments of about 15% and has implemented the policy in&#13;
1993, 1994 and 1995. After four tariff adjustments from April 1992, OSEB's average tariff&#13;
revenue in FY95, about Rs 1 .38/kWh, was sufficient to enable OSEB to cover the cost of its&#13;
operations in FY95 notwithstanding the high system losses. The Orissa government subsidy&#13;
(Rs. 1 ,6 10 million) was still required to cover extraordinary provision for uncollectible receivables&#13;
and write-offs for an amount of Rs 1,521 million. But for this additional provision and write-offs,&#13;
OSEB's tariffs were adequate to cover its costs and earn the statutory return in FY95. For FY96&#13;
even after tariff increase of 17% in November 1995, Orissa government needs to provide subsidy&#13;
to OSEB to cover large provision ( Rs. 1.3 billion) for bad and doubtful receivables and loss of&#13;
revenue due to delay in tariff revision. The accumulated subsidy has been off set against&#13;
government's loans and asset revaluation while transferring the assets to GRIDCO in April 1996.&#13;
13.   Future Tariffs Annual tariff adjustments to be implemented over the FY96-FY98 period&#13;
to meet the agreed financial targets of GRIDCO and OHPC are in the same range as those&#13;
implemented since April 1992, notwithstanding the entry of increasingly high cost new generation&#13;
from lb units 1-2, NTPC's Talcher and then lb units 5-6. Subsequent adjustments, in the FY99-&#13;
2001 period, will be even smaller. The main explanations for this reasonable tariff outlook are:&#13;
(a) past tariff adjustments have brought the tariffs to a level of cost recovery, notwithstanding the&#13;
current high system losses; (b) the small 6 per cent share of agricultural load and the introduction&#13;
of the central government's recommended minimum paise 50/kWh rate in 1992, i.e. the absence in&#13;
Orissa of the situation so common in India, where a substantial agricultural load is being served by&#13;
the SEBs at heavily subsidized rates; (c) low cost and relatively fast system loss reduction, given&#13;
the very high level of system losses, is an "alternative" source of additional revenue to be realized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

generation of the Upper Indravati project is very attractive in spite of the implementation delays&#13;
and when commissioned the project will have a positive impact on the finances of OHPC and&#13;
GRIDCO. The FY97 tariff adjustment, already authorized by the Government in GRIDCO's&#13;
provisional license issued on April 1, 1996, is expected to become effective by July 1996.&#13;
Subsequent tariff adjustments would be authorized by the Regulatory Commission. Annexes 2.4.&#13;
and 2.5 present OHPC's and GRIDCO's financial projections and tariff requirements.&#13;
14.   Structural Improvements. While the electricity tariff rates in Orissa have been raised to&#13;
cover the cost of supply in FY95, the structure of the tariffs still contains substantial distortions&#13;
from a structure set to cover the cost of service from each major consumer category. Industrial&#13;
and commercial consumers pay tariff rates in excess of the cost to supply them. The resulting&#13;
extra revenue is used to cross-subsidize agricultural and residential consumers. With the&#13;
introduction of GOI's minimum agricultural rate of paise 50/kWh in 1992 and subsequent&#13;
additional minor adjustments, and given the low share of agriculture in electricity consumption in&#13;
Orissa, the burden of cross-subsidizing agricultural consumers is bearable in Orissa. This is in&#13;
contrast to several other states in India, which report agricultural sales of 30-40% of total&#13;
consumption (though actual agricultural use of electricity may be substantially lower as discussed&#13;
in SAR Chapter 1). The bulk of cross-subsidies in Orissa is enjoyed by residential consumers.&#13;
GOO's policy statement includes a commitment to contain cross-subsidies and in the FY96&#13;
adjustment in November 1995 the Orissa government introduced a major structural improvement&#13;
in the residential tariffs, to limit cross-subsidy to the low monthly consumption levels and&#13;
thereafter progressively raise the rates to full cost recovery at highest monthly consumption levels.&#13;
Beyond FY97, the policy of containing cross-subsidies will be implemented by the Regulatory&#13;
Commission. Cross-subsidies can be reduced only gradually, given the very low income levels of&#13;
a large number of current and future residential electricity consumers and the Orissa government's&#13;
inability to provide direct subsidies from its budget.&#13;
Power Investments, Financing and Sustainability&#13;
15.   Investments under the Reform Program. Program investments include: (a) transmission&#13;
and distribution rehabilitation for system reinforcement and loss reduction; (b) consumer meters&#13;
and other demand-side management (DSM) investments; (c) the completion of the hydro&#13;
component of the ongoing Upper Indravati multipurpose hydro and irrigation project; (d) the&#13;
renovation of Orissa's only existing coal-fired thermal plant at Talcher; and (e) the privatization&#13;
and further development of coal-fired power generation at lb (the completion and privatization of&#13;
Ib units 1-2 and the construction of units 3-4). Additional power generation projects, beyond Ib&#13;
units 3-4, are expected to commence during the fiscal 1997-2003 period. Though a number of&#13;
memoranda of understanding (MOUs) and provisional power purchase agreements and their&#13;
equivalents have been signed with private power developers by OSEB and/or the Orissa&#13;
government, not many of these are expected to reach fruition, inter alia due to difficulties and&#13;
controversies in earlier non-competitively awarded projects and the March 1996 deadline set by&#13;
the central government for obtaining CEA's in-principle clearance of MOU projects. In order to&#13;
protect GRIDCO from such prior arrangements, at negotiations, agreement was reached that the&#13;
Government of Orissa will indemnify GRIDCO for all liabilities that may be incurred by GRIDCO&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 11 of 15&#13;
as a result commitments made by the Government or OSEB under provisional power purchase&#13;
agreements, Memoranda of Understanding or other similar arrangements with independent power&#13;
producers. Instead developers for future generation projects are expected to be selected by&#13;
GRIDCO through competitive bidding, as per Orissa's policy statement and GRIDCO's license&#13;
obligation. In addition to the lb units 5-6 (the AES Transpower project), this core investment&#13;
estimate assumes that two thermal projects with a capacity of 500 MW each will be launched in&#13;
the next few years and will commissioned in FY2002 and FY2004 respectively. In addition, a&#13;
provision for one hydro project, Sindol, is included in the above investments requirements. The&#13;
proposed Sindol project is planned as a series of three run-of-river stations, the first two at 100&#13;
MW and the third at 120 MW capacity. The justification of this investment program is analyzed&#13;
in SAR Chapter 5.&#13;
16.   Future Investments. About a quarter of India's coal reserves are located in Orissa and&#13;
accordingly the state has the potential for substantial further coal-based power development, for&#13;
sale within Orissa and for export to other states and regions. While GRIDCO will facilitate power&#13;
development for Orissa's needs, other agencies including the central government's NTPC and&#13;
POWERGRID are expected to play a major role in facilitating the development of Orissa's coal&#13;
resources for power. NTPC's investment program includes substantial further investment in&#13;
Orissa beyond the 2x500 MW Talcher station being developed under Bank support (Ln. 2845-&#13;
IN). Private developers are exploring possibilities in Orissa, including the Hong Kong-based&#13;
Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA), which has announced plans to develop a major station&#13;
(ultimately consisting of eight 660 MW units) in Orissa for sale to several states in the Eastern,&#13;
Western and Northern regions, to be facilitated by POWERGRID. Orissa's hydro potential is&#13;
significant only for local development. Fifteen medium and large hydro projects, totaling 2,450&#13;
MW, have been identified for potential development to help meet Orissa's needs. Most are&#13;
suitable for competitive development, some are expansions at existing sites or multipurpose&#13;
developments and expected to be undertaken by OHPC.&#13;
17.   Financing. The total cost of projected investments under the reform program in the&#13;
FY97-2003 is estimated at about US$3.3 billion. The cost estimates and financing arrangements&#13;
of the program are given in Attachment 1. The majority of the investments in the program, about&#13;
US$1.9 billion, are for private generation projects and are expected to be financed by project&#13;
sponsors and their financiers (domestic and international credit and capital markets and export&#13;
credit agencies). The balance of the program consists of the investments of GRIDCO and OHPC&#13;
(along with a relatively modest investment by NTPC for Talcher renovation). They are expected&#13;
to be financed substantially through internal cash generation of GRIDCO and OHPC, consistent&#13;
with their projected strong internal resource mobilization capability, by various local financiers,&#13;
ADB, ODA and as proposed by the Bank.&#13;
18.   Sustainability. The justification of the reform program in Chapter 5 includes a section&#13;
examining the expected development path of the Orissa power sector in the absence of the reform&#13;
program. It concludes that reform is a prerequisite to sustainable power development and&#13;
economic growth in Orissa. The launching of the reform program will, however, by itself not be&#13;
sufficient notwithstanding the actions already taken and the significant results already achieved&#13;
under the program. While Orissa's first private power project is about to reach financial closure,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 12 of 15&#13;
it has to be noted that this pioneer project will enjoy a Government of India counter-guarantee as&#13;
insisted upon by its developer and financiers. Future projects are unlikely to obtain such a&#13;
guarantee, Orissa's reform program notwithstanding. Central government counter-guarantees to&#13;
an individual state are limited to the total central assistance to that state, in practice well below&#13;
that. Orissa (which is a medium-size state) is unlikely to "qualify" for a second guarantee. Future&#13;
private generation projects will have to depend primarily on the financial strength of the client&#13;
(GRIDCO and later also the private distribution companies) and related security arrangements.&#13;
The sustainability of power development in Orissa, beyond the core investments in the&#13;
FY97-2003 program, depends critically on GREDCO/the private distributors and the&#13;
Regulatory Commission being able to create, demonstrate and maintain a track record of&#13;
commercially viable operations and prudent sector regulation. The proposed project is&#13;
designed to help develop the utilities and the Regulatory Commission and enable them to build&#13;
such a track record of performance. In the (obvious) absence of such a track record in the&#13;
immediate future, Bank guarantees may be sought to facilitate the implementation of the next 1-2&#13;
projects. The Bank has indicated to the Orissa government that for the guarantee to be&#13;
considered, Orissa would have to continue to implement the reform program and select project&#13;
developers through competitive bidding in line with GOO's policy statement. Bank guarantees&#13;
would also be considered to facilitate distribution privatization. In order to ease the concerns of&#13;
prospective private distributors about access to capital to upgrade the distribution systems, the&#13;
transfer of ongoing investments under the project and their financing including the Bank loan as&#13;
well as the leasing of investments made by GRIDCO financed under the proposed Bank loan&#13;
would also be allowed.&#13;
Distribution Privatization&#13;
19.   Distribution privatization by December 31, 2000, along with regulatory and tariff reforms,&#13;
is a key feature of Orissa's reform program. Accordingly, at negotiations agreement was reached&#13;
that GRIDCO will gradually transfer its distribution system to private distribution companies in&#13;
accordance with a program and timetable satisfactory to the Bank. As reflected in its policy&#13;
statement, GOO intends to complete the process well before the agreed deadline. Orissa's&#13;
distribution system, comprising 10 OSEB distribution circles, has been divided into four areas,&#13;
entitled Central, Southern, North-Eastern and North-Western. Each area consists of two or three&#13;
circles of OSEB. The distribution company areas have been selected so that they are reasonably&#13;
comparable regarding mixes of consumer loads and other criteria (such as growth potential).&#13;
GRIDCO has a mandate to privatize its distribution system gradually, area by area, by the end of&#13;
year 2000. Distribution areas will be privatized sequentially, rather than all at once, recognizing&#13;
that this is a new, and complex exercise and has to be carefully planned and managed to ensure&#13;
that it is successful.&#13;
20.   The First Distribution Privatization. The first privatization was complicated by the lack&#13;
of detailed and accurate information about the assets and liabilities of each OSEB circle and the&#13;
fact that the new Regulatory Commission is not yet in place. It was not considered appropriate to&#13;
structure a contractual arrangement that bypasses the Regulatory Commission; nor was it&#13;
straightforward to structure a mutually satisfactory arrangement that requires a private sector&#13;
company to accept now (in a lease contract) a future change to a new, but as yet unknown, set of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 13 of 15&#13;
rules that would affect the lease. Given the uncertainties about the Regulatory Commission and&#13;
the lack of detailed information any long-term transaction with the private sector would require&#13;
the Orissa government to give such guarantees and assurances to the private sector that they&#13;
would be very little transfer of risk. Privatization without the transfer of risk is amongst the worst&#13;
of possible privatization options. Orissa's distribution privatization will therefore be launched&#13;
with a short-term distribution operations agreement (DOA) that terminates at a fixed date (by&#13;
which time the Regulatory Commission is in place and also has an initial track record). The DOA&#13;
would be followed by either a long term lease or transfer of ownership to the private sector,&#13;
pursuant to a license granted by the Regulatory Commission. The company selected for the DOA&#13;
will have an exclusive opportunity to negotiate, within a specified period and subject to&#13;
performance, regarding the follow-up, long-term privatization arrangements. If such negotiations&#13;
result in an agreement, the DOA may be terminated early to allow the long-term arrangement to&#13;
commence. If an agreement can not be reached within the specified period, GRIDCO may&#13;
negotiate with other parties so as to ensure that a long-term arrangement is finalized by the&#13;
termination date of the DOA.&#13;
21.   Negotiations on a DOA of the Central Company (comprising three circles: Bhubarneswar,&#13;
Cuttack and Dhenkanal) are about to be completed. Four companies, that had earlier expressed&#13;
interest in taking over parts of OSEB's distribution system and had signed MOUs for specific,&#13;
partly over-lapping areas, were instead invited in February 1995 to participate in structured&#13;
negotiations to take over circles in the area of the proposed Central Company. A technical and&#13;
financial information package and a draft term sheet for the DOA prepared by the Reform&#13;
Implementation Organization with the assistance of the Reform Consultant were submitted to the&#13;
four companies ahead of negotiations. After several rounds of technical offers, price bids and&#13;
negotiations, one of the four companies was selected and final details of the Distribution&#13;
Operations Agreement (DOA) are being negotiated. At negotiations, agreement was reached that&#13;
disbursements under Part A of the proposed project will commence once, inter alia, after one&#13;
distribution area has been placed under a lease/management contract acceptable to the Bank. The&#13;
DOA about to be signed meets the Bank's expectations. For the other disbursement condition,&#13;
please see para. 8.&#13;
22.   The term of the DOA would be up to three years. The company's compensation for its&#13;
services would be in the form of a fee consisting of a fixed element (which would be subject to&#13;
indexation) and a variable incentive fee. The incentive fee in the short-term lease is determined&#13;
primarily by the reference to any increase in the net revenues realized over the term of the&#13;
agreement (net of changes in tariff rates) for each kWh supplied to the circles as metered at&#13;
designated bulk supply points. The agreement would provide for additional elements of the&#13;
incentive fee to be calculated by reference to other measures of performance. These include: (a)&#13;
promptness and regularity of metering of supplies; (b) proportion of working meters out of total&#13;
meters installed; (c) cost of service to the consumers; (d) time to complete and number of repairs;&#13;
(e) time to complete and number of new connections; (f) security of supply; (g) accuracy of bills;&#13;
and (h) number of accidents. These additional elements will become more prominent in the&#13;
follow-up long-term arrangement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 14 of 15&#13;
23.   Privatization of the Remaining Areas. The two-stage process of the first privatization --&#13;
short term followed by long term arrangement -- would no longer be required once the&#13;
Regulatory Commission has become operational and detailed and accurate information about the&#13;
assets and liabilities has become available. Hence, the strategy outlined above is to be replaced by&#13;
a long term lease or sale at least for some of the other three distribution companies. They are to&#13;
be privatized under contracts to be awarded through a transparent competitive bidding process&#13;
with the assistance of the Reform Consultant. Detailed data collection to facilitate due diligence&#13;
and accelerate the privatization process is underway. Long-term lease or sale contracts are&#13;
expected to feature much more prominently the additional elements of incentive fee of the short-&#13;
term lease listed above and will also reflect the license requirements of the Regulatory&#13;
Commission, including the promotion of the efficient use of electricity by their consumers. There&#13;
is currently a preference for a long-term lease over an outright sale of assets, due to two factors:&#13;
(a) the condition of existing assets is generally poor, due to insufficient maintenance and less than&#13;
satisfactory operational practices. Possible protracted arguments over the valuation of assets can&#13;
be eased if not avoided by opting for a politically more acceptable lease, where it will be easier for&#13;
the Orissa government to accept and defend lower, more realistic lease payments as the transfer of&#13;
the ownership of the assets is not involved; and (b) in the case of non-performance, it would be&#13;
much easier for GRIDCO to terminate the lease and take over the assets than in the case of&#13;
transfer of ownership. Outright sale of assets has, however, not been ruled out for the private&#13;
distribution companies and importantly, lease of sale, the private distribution companies will be&#13;
required to assume the responsibility for future investment in their areas. The proceeds of the&#13;
Bank and assets already installed using such proceeds can be transferred from GRIDCO to the&#13;
companies so as to facilitate meeting this requirement.&#13;
24.   Investment and Staff Arrangements. The objective of the DOA is to initiate the&#13;
distribution privatization program as quickly as possible, paving the way for longer term&#13;
arrangements for involving the private sector throughout Orissa's distribution system, and to&#13;
introduce private sector skills into distribution to improve management, operational efficiency and&#13;
quality of service. The bulk of investments in system rehabilitation and reinforcement would be&#13;
made by GRIDCO. The company would be invited to help manage and execute GRIDCO's&#13;
capital investment program, to be supported under the proposed project. The company would be&#13;
expected to provide its own staff for key management posts, the rest would be seconded by&#13;
GRIDCO to work for and be managed and paid by the company. The long-term leases or sale&#13;
contracts will shift the investment obligation from GRIDCO to the new companies. Staff would&#13;
similarly be transferred from GRIDCO and become regular employees of the companies. Some of&#13;
prospective companies pursuing distribution business in Orissa have indicated to the Orissa&#13;
government (and in informal discussions with Bank staff) their readiness to: (a) accept such staff&#13;
transfer arrangements, initial staff surpluses notwithstanding; and (b) deal with the staff&#13;
rationalization issues over a period of time in line with GRIDCO's own five-year staff transition&#13;
plan. Ongoing investments including those under the proposed project would either continue to&#13;
be financed by GRIDCO and leased to the companies upon their completion or transferred to the&#13;
new companies.&#13;
25.   Financial Viability. GRIDCO's financial projections have been prepared on the basis of&#13;
including the total investment requirements in distribution and keeping all 10 circles in the service&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 15 of 15&#13;
areas of GRIDCO, in order to establish the viability of distribution as a whole. When distribution&#13;
areas are privatized, GRIDCO will transfer parts of this business, which overall has been&#13;
established to be viable. The transfer prices (primarily the lease payments and bulk power tariffs&#13;
to be paid by the companies) will be set so as to ensure that both the new distribution entities and&#13;
the remaining GRIDCO businesses remain viable. Both GRIDCO and the new distribution&#13;
companies would therefore be able to earn reasonable returns on their investments, subject to&#13;
satisfactory performance.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
ORISSA POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
ORISSA HYDRO POWER CORPORATION (OHPC)&#13;
Operations and Organization&#13;
1.    Corporate Mission. OHPC was incorporated, under the Companies Act of 1956, on April&#13;
21, 1995. Its role in the power sector reform program and the emerging new industry and market&#13;
structures are described in chapter 2 and detailed in Annex 2.3. OHPC will be responsible for the&#13;
operations and maintenance of the existing plants taken over from the Government of Orissa and&#13;
OSEB and the hydro component of the Upper Indravati project as well as their expansion where&#13;
feasible and viable. OHPC is also expected to participate in future hydro development,&#13;
particularly in developing future multi-purpose projects which by their nature are not readily&#13;
suited for development through competitive bidding (para. 7).&#13;
2.    Organization and Management. OHPC is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of&#13;
a Chairman and Managing Director (CMD), four full-time directors (one each for Operations,&#13;
Engineering, Finance &amp; Commercial, and Human Resource Management) and four part-time&#13;
directors, one of them representing the Orissa government and three non-government directors&#13;
with expertise in legal affairs, finance/banking, and hydro power projects. The company will have&#13;
a General Manager to head the Information Technology function. The Chief of Internal Audit will&#13;
report directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. This is a significant departure&#13;
from the prevailing practice of the Chief Auditor reporting to the Director (Finance) in most of&#13;
the public sector organizations in India. A company secretary-cum-law officer has already been&#13;
appointed. The three non-government directors have also been appointed to the Board. In&#13;
addition, Finance &amp; Commercial and Human Resources Directors will be recruited externally. The&#13;
management structure is regarded satisfactory and the significant non-government representation&#13;
is expected to help strengthen OHPC's autonomy from the state government.&#13;
3.    OHPC's organization structure is built around six main functions: (a) Operations&#13;
responsible for operation and maintenance of existing hydro projects organized into two zones i.e.&#13;
Zonal Manager (North) responsible for Hirakud and Rengali, and Zonal Manager ( South)&#13;
responsible for Balimela, Upper Kolab, and Machukund; maintenance of the catchment area;&#13;
hydrology and technology upgrading; (b) Engineering responsible for engineering safety and&#13;
policy, water-shed management and environmental protection, project planning, coordination with&#13;
CEA, GRIDCO, new site investigation and preparation of project reports, project design and&#13;
specification, surveys, procurement, construction management, and renovation; (c)mFinance &amp;&#13;
Commercial responsible for financial accounts, budgets and cost control, treasury, and PPA&#13;
administration; (d) Internal Audit for auditing financial accounts, and commercial operations; (e)&#13;
Human Resources and Administration for personnel policies, personnel management, industrial&#13;
relations, training and development, health and safety, land acquisition; and (f) Information&#13;
Technology responsible for system development, system standard and security, and network&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

operation. In addition, Upper Indravati ( currently under construction) will be headed by a&#13;
Project Administrator reporting to the Chairman. The organization chart of OHPC is attached as&#13;
Attachment 1.&#13;
Institutional Development, Staffing and Training&#13;
4.    Institution-Building. Technical assistance for OHPC's institution building, under Part C&#13;
of the proposed project, will help OHPC refine its organization structure, develop and introduce&#13;
financial, personnel and management systems, and assist in developing the staff capacity to make&#13;
the companies efficient and viable corporate entities. The scope of the program covers the same&#13;
items listed in para.4 of Annex 2.5 for GRIDCO, details are given in Annexes 4.1-4.2. The&#13;
institution-building consultant team will include a utility with experience in hydro generation to&#13;
assist OHPC in hydro project planning, operations and maintenance.&#13;
5.    Staffing and Training, Cadre. At present OSEB has about 35,450 staff, of whom about&#13;
5,000 will be transferred to OHPC. Preliminary estimates of the institution building consultants,&#13;
indicate staff surpluses of about 10% in hydro plants and are well within manageable limits. With&#13;
expansion in the system some staff will be redeployable though some of them require retraining.&#13;
Unlike GRIDCO the magnitude of staff redundancy and the associated costs are not expected to&#13;
be high and can be met from internal resources of the company. A five-year transition plan,&#13;
similar to that of GRIDCO, is under preparation. At negotiations agreement was reached that&#13;
OHPC will submit its five-year staff transition plan to the Bank by December 31, 1996. OHPC's&#13;
cadre and staff training programs will be developed and implemented along the lines of GRIDCO.&#13;
At negotiations it was agreed that OHPC will develop the cadre as follows: (a) develop and adopt&#13;
"Classification, Control and Appeal" regulations and "Recruitment and Promotion" regulations by&#13;
December 31, 1996; and (b) complete the transfer of staff to the new cadre by March 31, 1997.&#13;
Private Sector Participation in OHPC&#13;
6.    The Government of Orissa is committed to divesting gradually its equity in OHPC,&#13;
starting with employee share issues and private placements, subsequently public bond and equity&#13;
issues, the first of which is expected by March 31, 2000, by which time OHPC is expected to have&#13;
established a satisfactory track record of profitable operations. At negotiations agreement was&#13;
reached that OHPC will list its shares and the Government of Orissa and OHPC will offer them&#13;
for sale to the public in accordance with a program and timetable satisfactory to the Bank. While&#13;
little operating efficiency gains are expected from privatizing Orissa's existing hydro facilities,&#13;
private sector participation will enable the Orissa government to release its substantial investments&#13;
in such facilities for use in other priority sectors. Critical issues relating to the multi-use character&#13;
of the facilities (hydro and irrigation, plus in some cases also flood control) will have to be&#13;
resolved and appropriately reflected in OHPC's power purchase agreements to facilitate&#13;
commercial operation of OHPC and private sector participation. Similarly important on&#13;
privatization prospects will be the development of the commercial relations between OHPC and&#13;
GRIDCO and GRIDCO and the distribution companies. These issues will be addressed in phase 2&#13;
and phase 3 of the Reform Consultant's work.&#13;

Investments&#13;
7.    OHPC has inherited from OSEB the renovation of two of the six units at Orissa's oldest&#13;
hydro station at Hirakud and from the Orissa government the hydro component of the Upper&#13;
Indravati multi-purpose hydro and irrigation project. Hirakud work is financed by ODA. Upper&#13;
Indravati was supported under Cr. 1356-IN until the exhaustion of funds in March 1995. OHPC&#13;
would complete the hydro component and the Orissa government's Department of Water&#13;
Resources the irrigation works. Future investments are expected to include further renovation&#13;
work at Hirakud and the 2x60 MW expansion of Balimela hydro station for additional peaking&#13;
power capacity. OHPC is expected to participate in future hydro development, possibly by&#13;
implementing projects secured through competitive bidding and in particular by developing future&#13;
multi-purpose hydro and irrigation (possibly also flood control) projects (which by their nature are&#13;
not readily suited for development through competitive bidding). Fifteen medium and large hydro&#13;
projects, totaling 2,450 MW, have been identified for potential development in Orissa. Most are&#13;
suitable for competitive development, two are expansions at existing sites and expected to be&#13;
undertaken by OHPC.&#13;
Finances&#13;
8.    Historical Performance. A summary of the performance of OSEB, GRIDCO's and&#13;
OHPC's predecessor organization, for the last six years beginning FY90, including OSEB's&#13;
income statement, sources and application of funds, and balance sheet, is provided in Annex 2.1.&#13;
9.    Valuation and Transfer of Assets. The valuation and transfer to GRIDCO and OHPC of&#13;
fixed assets which previously belonged to OSEB and the Orissa government is described in Annex&#13;
2.1. The following major hydro facilities will be transferred to OHPC: (a) the Orissa&#13;
government's hydro plants at Rengali (units 3-5) and at Upper Kolab (units 3-4); (b) the Upper&#13;
Indravati project; (c) OSEB's hydro plants at Hirakud, Rengali (units 1-2), Balimela, and Upper&#13;
Kolab (units 1-2); and (d) the ongoing Hirakud renovation works.&#13;
10.   Traditionally the Orissa government has provided loans-in-perpetuity for construction of&#13;
hydro projects. Since OSEB has depreciated these assets but not repaid the loans, its accounts&#13;
showed outstanding long-term loans exceeding the historical depreciated value of its hydro&#13;
projects. Compared to Rs. 3,639 million the depreciated historical cost of these assets, the&#13;
associated liabilities were valued at Rs. 4,379 million. This difference of Rs. 740 million has been&#13;
offset against the revaluation of assets. In the case of the past loans for hydro developments, the&#13;
Orissa government has agreed to transfer Rs. 3,000 million as equity and consolidate the balance&#13;
in a new loan to OHPC which will be repaid over 15 years subject to a 5 year period of grace.&#13;
11.   As in the case of GRIDCO, the Orissa government has agreed to revalue fixed assets by&#13;
an amount of about Rs. 8,400 million before transferring these to OHPC. After revaluation and&#13;
off setting excess liabilities ( para. 10), OHPC has a revaluation reserve of Rs 7.6 billion, which&#13;
will be accounted for through issue of "Partially Convertible Bonds". OHPC will issue its&#13;
convertible bonds on the same terms as those being issued for GRIDCO. The impact of&#13;
revaluation of hydro assets on OHPC's and GRIDCO's tariffs is shown in Attachment 4.&#13;

13.    OHPC' s financial strategy is designed to address the need to finance large hydro&#13;
investments without having to depend on uncertain budgetary flows from the Orissa government.&#13;
It has ag,reed that it will seek close to a market rate of return on equity to enable it to tap capital&#13;
markets for part of its future investments requirements. It is proposing by FY99 to divest a part&#13;
of its equity through issue of shares possibly to a strategic investor. OHPC's tariffs are driven by&#13;
its objective to achieve a minimum return on equity of 16%. It is expected that from FY2001&#13;
onwards OHPC would start paying dividends to its shareholders.&#13;
14. TariJyfs and Profitability. The Orissa government has proposed to raise OHPC's tariff&#13;
revenue in FY97 to a level adequate for OHPC to break-even ( about Rs 0.34/kWh (compared to&#13;
the current average level of about Rs 0.28/kWh prior to revaluation of hydro fixed assets) and&#13;
increase it at an average rate of about 21% over the next three years. To ensure adequate&#13;
maintenance of hydro projects OHPC has set the repair and maintenance budget for FY 97 at Rs.&#13;
265 million, a quantum jump from about Rs 60 million budgeted for FY 96. This sets the&#13;
benchmark for repair and maintenance budget of OHPC to be covered through tariff, and is&#13;
reflected in the financial projections of OHPC (Attachment 2). As discussed in Annex 2.3, India&#13;
has adopted a target of 16% as the benchmark allowable return on equity investments for private&#13;
power generation projects, which is selected as a reference rate for OHPC, (and a comparable&#13;
return on capital base target on licensees, to be adopted for GRIDCO, Annex 2. 5). At&#13;
negotiations agreement was reached that OHPC will take all such measures (including, without&#13;
limitation, adjustments of the level and structure of its tariffs) and conduct its operations and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.4&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
affairs in such manner as to achieve, in FY97, revenues from all sources related operations and&#13;
non-operating income sufficient to cover all expenses related to operations including&#13;
administration, adequate maintenance, taxes, payments in lieu of taxes, adequate depreciation and&#13;
other non-cash operating charges and interest and other charges on debt, and in each subsequent&#13;
fiscal year such rate as is permissible under applicable GOI notifications. The rate of return in&#13;
FY97 would be lower, in view of the still ongoing transition and the impact of asset revaluation.&#13;
If projected tariff increases are approved by the regulator, OHPC should be able to achieve a&#13;
return on equity of about 3% in FY97 and 16% through FY2003. However, after comnmnissioning&#13;
of the Upper Indravati Hydro Project in FY2001, OHPC would need to increase its tariff by an&#13;
annual average of 32% in the two year period FY2001-2 and no tariff increase in FY 2003 for&#13;
achieving 16% return.&#13;
15.   Liquidity and Contribution to Capital Investment. As a result of the revaluation of the&#13;
fixed assets OHPC took over from OSEB, its depreciation expense will be larger and provide&#13;
significantly higher internal financing of its investment program. It is expected to have a self&#13;
financing ratio well above 20%. This is mainly because no new hydro investments after Upper&#13;
Indravati are planned. However, it should be able to undertake further large investments in hydro&#13;
projects after 2001. Since all state government loans have been consolidated into one loan with a&#13;
five-year moratorium and 10-year repayment, OHPC's debt service coverage will be in excess of&#13;
2.0 times until FY2000. After this date, the cover will fall to a comfortable 1.5 times. At&#13;
negotiations agreement was reached that OHPC will from fiscal 1998 not incur any debt, unless a&#13;
reasonable forecast of the revenues and expenditures of OHPC show that the estimated net&#13;
revenues of OHPC for each financial year during the term of the debt to be incurred would be at&#13;
least 1.5 times the estimated debt service requirements of OHPC in such year on all debt of&#13;
OHPC, including the debt to be incurred. OHPC's financial projections show that it should be&#13;
able to meet the 1.5 times target comfortably from FY97. At negotiations agreement was also&#13;
reached that OHPC will from FY97, maintain its accounts receivable at a level not exceeding two&#13;
months average billing and its accounts payables at a level not exceeding two months equivalent&#13;
of purchases (payments as per its contracts with suppliers).&#13;
16.   Financing Plan. OHPC's financing plan is provided in Attachment 1 to Annex 2.3. A&#13;
summary is given in Table 2. It proposes investment of Rs 12.4 billion to be financed 30% from&#13;
intemal cash generation and 70% from borrowing. OHPC has already contracted an ODA grant&#13;
for Rs 0.7 billion to be onlent through PFC; and a loan from PFC itself for Rs 3.2 billion. Project&#13;
execution under this plan is expected to be much improved, since the bulk of financing of OHPC' s&#13;
investment plans will now be independent of the Orissa govemment's budget. At negotiations&#13;
agreement was reached that OHPC, like GRIDCO, would from FY97 fumish by December 31&#13;
each year, its 5-year financial projections, including its investment program and financing plan, for&#13;
the Bank's review and comments.&#13;

the Companies Act of 1956, on April 20, 1995. GRIDCO will be responsible for transmission,&#13;
coordination of system planning and operations and, initially, distribution and contracting for new&#13;
generation. GRIDCO's central role in the power sector reform program and the emerging new&#13;
industry and market structures are described in Chapter 2 and detailed in Annex 2.3. GRIDCO as&#13;
OSEB's successor organization will represent Orissa at the Eastern Region Electricity Board and&#13;
will coordinate system operations with the Eastern Region Load Dispatch Center operated by&#13;
POWERGRID. GRIDCO is finalizing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with OHPC and&#13;
OPGC for Ib units 1-2 (on the basis of model thermal and hydro PPAs developed by the PPA&#13;
reform working group). The PPA signed between OSEB and AES Transpower for lb valley&#13;
project will be assigned to GRIDCO. GRIDCO will also replace OSEB as the contracting party&#13;
for Orissa in NTPC's bulk power supply agreement in the Eastern region (for NTPC's stations at&#13;
Farakka, Kahalgaon and Talcher). GRIDCO will, on the basis of projected system needs,&#13;
contract new generation capacity for Orissa. Its license will obligate GRIDCO to do so with&#13;
economy and efficiency; compliance will be monitored by the Regulator. Finally, GRIDCO will&#13;
have a mandate to privatize its distribution system by the end of 2000.&#13;
2.    Organization and Management. GRIDCO is managed by a Board of Directors, consisting&#13;
of GRIDCO's Chairman and Managing Director (CMD), six full-time directors (one each for&#13;
Transmission projects, Distribution, Commercial, Finance, Corporate Planning and Divestiture,&#13;
and Human Resource Management), and seven part-time directors, two representing the Orissa&#13;
government (secretaries of the Departments of Energy and Industries) and five non-governmental&#13;
directors with expertise in industry, power sector, finance/accounting/commercial matters,&#13;
banking and project finance, and telecommunication to be drawn from Indian financial institutions&#13;
and the industrial sector as well as, in the future, GRIDCO's expected private sector shareholders.&#13;
The Chief Auditor will report directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, a&#13;
significant departure from the prevailing practice of the chief auditor reporting to Director&#13;
Finance in most of the public sector companies in India. The company has selected, from the&#13;
open market, three directors in charge of Finance, Commercial, and Human Resource&#13;
management functions. A company secretary-cum-law officer has also been appointed. Once&#13;
GRIDCO privatizes its distribution business, it will not need full time directors looking after&#13;
distribution and marketing and will reconstitute its Board. Three non-government have already&#13;
joined the Board. The management structure is regarded satisfactory and the significant non-&#13;
government representation is expected to help strengthen GRIDCO's autonomy from the state&#13;
government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.5&#13;
Page 2 of II&#13;
3.    GRIDCO is organized on the basis of six main functions: (a) the Transmission function&#13;
is responsible for load survey, load forecasting; supply of bulk power; planning, construction,&#13;
telecommunication, operation and maintenance of the grid including interconnection with other&#13;
systems. It would own and operate all extra-high tension (here 132 kV and above) transmission&#13;
assets, including 132 kV step-down sub-stations; (b) Distribution is organized under four&#13;
divisions operating as profit centers, grouping OSEB's 10 circles in a manner which facilitates&#13;
their privatization. For the Central Zone, for which Distribution Operations Agreement is&#13;
expected to be signed shortly with a private utility, a coordinator will be appointed while other&#13;
three zones will be headed by General Managers; (c) Finance is responsible for investments,&#13;
resource mobilization, financial budget, financial accounts, cost accounting and control; (d) the&#13;
Commercial function is responsible for procurement of bulk power, PPA administration, and&#13;
load dispatch; (e) Human Resource Management is responsible for personnel management,&#13;
industrial relations, personnel policies, staff redundancies, training and development,&#13;
rehabilitation and resettlement of project-affected people; and (f) Corporate Planning and&#13;
Divestiture is responsible for planning, disinvestment, and the overall coordination of the Orissa&#13;
Power Sector Restructuring Project . In addition there will be two Chief Engineers one looking&#13;
after Information Technology; and the other environmental protection, engineering practices and&#13;
procedures, and safety. GRIDCO's organization chart is given in Attachment 1.&#13;
Institutional Development, Staffing and Training&#13;
4.    Institutional Development. Technical assistance for GRIDCO's institution building,&#13;
under Part C of the proposed project, will help GRIDCO refine its organizational structure,&#13;
develop and introduce financial, personnel and management systems, and assist in developing the&#13;
staff capacity to make the companies efficient and viable corporate entities. The scope of the&#13;
program, detailed in Annex 4.1, covers: (a) system operations, maintenance policies, standards&#13;
and procedures; (b) corporate planning, financial and accounting systems (including the&#13;
requirements of the Companies Act and the Electricity (Supply) Act, accounting policies, cost&#13;
accounting, internal control and internal audit system; (c) commercial systems including&#13;
metering, billing, and collection, revenue improvement, and the administration of PPAs; (d)&#13;
design and implementation of an MIS; (e) human resource development covering personnel&#13;
policies, man power plans, career development, compensation, training, organization and process&#13;
for handling staff redundancies; and (f) environmental management. The management structure&#13;
of the technical assistance program is given at Annex 4.2.&#13;
5.    Staffingand Training. At present OSEB has about 35,450 staffofwhom about 5,000&#13;
will go to OHPC and the rest 30,450 to GRIDCO, of which 5,050 shall be for transmission and&#13;
25,400 for distribution. Preliminary estimates of the institution building Consultant, indicates&#13;
that with growth in business within five years the staff surpluses will reduce to about 1 1% in&#13;
absolute numbers, though there will be mismatch in the skill level during the transition period&#13;
which are sought to be addressed through re-training and re-deployment. Any immediate&#13;
reduction in staff would be disruptive to the restructuring process and would require funds for&#13;
retrenchment. Several options for dealing with staff redundancies ( in numbers as well as skills)&#13;
are under consideration. Surpluses in transmission are well within manageable limits. Potential&#13;
private distribution investors have shown willingness to accept surplus staff and deal with&#13;
redundancy over a five-year period (Annex 2.3). With expansion in the system some staff will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.5&#13;
Page 3 of 11&#13;
redeployable after some retraining. A five-year transition plan for staff rationalization through&#13;
natural attrition, voluntary retirement, retraining and redeployment is under preparation under&#13;
GRIDCO's technical assistance program, based on a thorough review of the age and skill profile&#13;
of existing staff. At negotiations agreement was reached that GRIDCO will submit its five-year&#13;
staff transition plan to the Bank by December 31, 1996. ODA has shown interest in providing&#13;
grant funding to Orissa to help with GRIDCO's capitalization, which might include some costs&#13;
of staff redundancy. Thus this expenditure would be capitalized and its cost recovered through&#13;
tariffs.&#13;
6.    Cadre. By March 31,1997 GRIDCO will create a cadre of its own staff, so that its&#13;
officers and other staff become the employees of the company rather than remain on secondment&#13;
from the Orissa government as has been the past practice with OSEB. Most of the OSEB&#13;
engineers were employees of the state government and seconded to OSEB. This practice was not&#13;
found conducive to development of employee commitment, discipline, and managerial&#13;
effectiveness. Existing staff in the power sector will be given an option to join the companies&#13;
under new employment contracts, not inferior to their existing service conditions, and be allowed&#13;
to retain their pension and other benefits of current employment. Cadre development shall include&#13;
pay and compensation, conditions of service, personnel policies, and human resource development&#13;
policies. At negotiations agreement was reached that GRIDCO will develop the cadre as follows:&#13;
(a) develop and adopt "Classification, Control and Appeal" regulations and "Recruitment and&#13;
Promotion" regulations by December 31, 1996; and (b) complete the transfer of staff to the new&#13;
cadre by March 3 1, 1997.&#13;
7.    Training. GRIDCO's institution-building consultants are helping it to identify training&#13;
needs, select local as well as foreign training institutes, arrange and provide training in technical,&#13;
financial, human resource development, and utility management, as well as organize study tours.&#13;
To build up a sustainable institutional capacity of GRIDCO in training of its staff, the consultants&#13;
are also helping GRIDCO: (a) establish a nucleus of training staff, who will be trained in&#13;
carrying on this activity in future; (b) develop local institutional capability of training institutes;&#13;
and (c) develop training manuals including training strategy, policy, and procedures. The&#13;
training program and support facilities and equipment would be financed under the proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
Private Sector Participation in GRIDCO&#13;
8.    GRIDCO has a mandate under the reform program to privatize its distribution system.&#13;
Distribution privatization is one of the key features of the reform program and is described in&#13;
Annex 2.3. For GRIDCO it will be the primary area of immediate attention in terms of attracting&#13;
private sector participation. In addition, the Orissa government is committed to divest gradually&#13;
its equity in GRIDCO, starting with employee share issues and private placements. This will&#13;
subsequently be followed by public bond and equity issues, the first of which is expected by&#13;
March 2001, by which time GRIDCO is expected to have established a satisfactory track record&#13;
of profitable operations. The Orissa government will also explore possibilities for a placement of&#13;
shares to other grid companies including POWERGRID. The timing of privatization depends on&#13;
GRIDCO's ability to establish a track record of sound operational and financial performance,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.5&#13;
Page 4 of 11&#13;
including collection from its clients (retail and distribution companies). At negotiations agreement&#13;
was reached that GRIDCO will list its shares and the Government of Orissa and GRIDCO would&#13;
offer them for sale to the public in accordance with a program and timetable satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank. The Orissa government is expected to retain majority ownership of GRIDCO in the initial&#13;
years, until the completion of GRIDCO's institution building program and the stabilization of the&#13;
operations of Orissa's new power system being created under the reform program. The&#13;
performance of the Regulator and the behavior of the Orissa government as the owner will also be&#13;
critical to the success of efforts to attract private investment in GRIDCO and overall sustainability&#13;
of the program. To ensure that GRIDCO's suppliers/buyers of power can not influence the&#13;
policies, operations and business decisions of GRIDCO in their favor, the Orissa government has&#13;
decided that no single generator/distributor, its associates and related companies, subsidiaries etc.&#13;
shall be allowed to hold individually and collectively a controlling stake in GRIDCO's equity.&#13;
This is reflected in the Orissa government's policy statement.&#13;
Investments&#13;
9.    Transmission. The investment program of the power sector (Annex 2.3) includes the&#13;
expected private sector investments in generation and GRIDCO's investment program has been&#13;
designed accordingly. GRIDCO's transmission investment plan is designed to meet the&#13;
generation expansion plan and load projections on the distribution system. It includes system&#13;
voltages from 400 kV down to 220 kV and 132 kV. Details are given in Annex 3.1, GRIDCO's&#13;
(and OHPC's) year-wise investments are presented in Annex 2.3.&#13;
10.   Distribution. Orissa's distribution system is overloaded and low voltage lines are lengthy,&#13;
further increasing system losses. The chronic unavailability of funds, equipment and spare parts&#13;
has resulted in the system deteriorating to a point where it no longer meets any reasonable&#13;
operational standards and the frequency and duration of outages have increased. The immediate&#13;
focus of distribution investments, supported under Part A of the proposed Project, is on the rapid&#13;
installation of cost-effective, fairly low-cost and fast measures and provision of spares to reverse&#13;
the deterioration of the system, while at the same time preparing and implementing the&#13;
conventional reinforcement investments (additional transformers at substations, voltage&#13;
upgrading, new feeders), which will take longer to commission. The composition of the capital&#13;
investment program is discussed in Annex 3.1. Its linkage to distribution privatization is&#13;
discussed in Annex 2.3. The investment program also includes reform expenditure, which is to be&#13;
capitalized and its cost recovered through future tariffs.&#13;
Finances&#13;
11.   Historical Performance. A summary of the performance of OSEB, GRIDCO's and&#13;
OHPC's predecessor organization, for the last six years beginning FY90, including OSEB's&#13;
income statement, sources and application of funds, and balance sheet, is provided in Annex 2. 1.&#13;
12.   Valuation and Transfer of Assets. Under Orissa's reform program, the power facilities&#13;
previously owned by OSEB and the Orissa government have been transferred to GRIDCO and&#13;
OHPC. Annex 2.1 shows how the assets and liabilities have been split between the new owners.&#13;
This has been accomplished by the Orissa government first taking over all assets and liabilities of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.5&#13;
Page 5 of 11&#13;
OSEB and then transferring these to the new owners. GRIDCO is not only taking over all the&#13;
transmission and distribution assets but also the unpaid electricity and other receivables together&#13;
with the related provision for bad and doubtful debts. The Orissa government has also agreed to&#13;
revalue the fixed assets by about 200% for GRIDCO and about 300% for OHPC before&#13;
transferring these to the new companies. This is a path-breaking decision since it is the first&#13;
occasion where an SEB has been permitted to revalue its fixed assets. This will enable the state&#13;
government to realize a more realistic value for its past investments at the time of privatization. It&#13;
will also help the sector, to provide more self-financing for new investments, due to the higher&#13;
depreciation which the new owners can recover on the revalued fixed assets. This will help&#13;
eliminate GRIDCO's and OHPC's dependence on budgetary support from the Orissa government.&#13;
However, the state government has only agreed to revalue these assets provided no major,&#13;
immediate additional tariff adjustment is sought since this could threaten the successful&#13;
implementation of the reform program. This has been achieved by transferring the revaluation&#13;
related liabilities as Zero Coupon partially convertible bond, which mitigates the burden of interest&#13;
in the initial years. The impact of the revaluation of fixed assets on GRIDCO's tariffs is shown in&#13;
Attachment 4.&#13;
13.   Revaluation will increase the value of fixed assets by Rs 11.2 billion. Maintenance stocks&#13;
of OSEB will be valued down from Rs 656 million to Rs 150 million which is considered as usable&#13;
stores; and receivables valued down from Rs 5,857 million to Rs 1468 million (net of provisions&#13;
amounting to Rs 3,937 million). The Orissa government will transfer fixed assets to GRIDCO&#13;
with a depreciated replacement cost of about Rs 19.5 billion and work-in-progress of Rs 1.3&#13;
billion. Rather than establishing a revaluation of assets reserve to hold the increase in net fixed&#13;
assets arising from the revaluation, as adjusted by downward valuation of stocks and receivables,&#13;
the government has agreed instead to accept a partially convertible bond. The Orissa government&#13;
will receive Rs 4.0 billion in the form of" Partially Convertible Bonds" from GRIDCO,&#13;
and Rs 2.5 billion as share capital. In addition, government loans for Rs 732 million have been&#13;
converted into equity. OSEB also has unfunded liabilities, currently estimated at Rs 1.5 billion,&#13;
for pension and other terminal benefits of its staff, who will now be transferred to the new&#13;
companies. GRIDCO shall adjust it against revaluation amount and issue a partially convertible&#13;
bond, to Employee's Pension Trust Fund. The bonds will have a fifteen-year maturity and will be&#13;
interest free for the first five years, and then, pay interest at 13% p.a. till maturity. Half of the&#13;
face value of the bonds issued to GOO will be converted to share capital in three equal&#13;
installments in the sixth, eighth, and tenth years. The bond issued to the Employee's Pension&#13;
Fund will be redeemable in ten equal annual installments from year 6 through 15 but the holder&#13;
will have the option, to be exercised as and when the installment falls dues, to convert it into&#13;
equity. Reform expenditures being financed by ODA will be passed on by the state government to&#13;
GRIDCO and form part of the Orissa government's equity and loans. Other existing loans such&#13;
as those from PFC, REC, IDBI and LIC will be transferred to GRIDCO.&#13;
14.   GRIDCO 's Future Finances. GRIDCO's opening balance sheet has been prepared using&#13;
figures based on the arrangements described above. Its projected financial statements are&#13;
provided in Attachment 2. Attachment 3 gives the related assumptions which were used to&#13;
prepare the forecasts. GRIDCO's forecast financial performance for the period FY97-2003 is&#13;
summarized in Table 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.5&#13;
Page 6 of 11&#13;
15.    GRIDCO's financial indicators have been chosen with the objective of increasing its level&#13;
of self-financing so as to reduce its dependence on the Orissa government's budgetary support&#13;
and to enhance its ability to access funds from capital markets on reasonable terms. It was&#13;
concluded that the Bank's traditional financial performance measures for typical state-owned&#13;
power utilities, based on a mninimum rate of return on revalued net fixed assets or a minimum level&#13;
of self-financing were not suitable. The rate of return approach could not be used because, in&#13;
India, there is no generally accepted method of undertaking annual revaluation of fixed assets.&#13;
The self-financing measure was also judged unsuitable because GRIDCO is expected to reduce its&#13;
future investment requirements quite sharply as it progressively privatizes its distribution&#13;
functions. Accordingly, a suitable measure of market returns on investment which would be&#13;
linked to the cost of capital was needed. The measure which best meets this description is a&#13;
target rate of return on capital base (equity plus reserves used in the business). As discussed in&#13;
Annex 2.3, India has adopted a target of 16% as the benchmark allowable return on equity&#13;
investments for private power generation projects, (to be adopted for OHIPC, Annex 2.4), and a&#13;
comparable return on capital base target on licensees, is to be adopted for GRIDCO.&#13;

16.    At negotiations agreement was reached that GRIDCO will take all such measures&#13;
(including, without limitation, adjustments of the level and structure of its tariffs) and conduct its&#13;
operations and affairs in such manner as to achieve: (1) in FY97, revenues from all sources&#13;
related to operations and net non-operations income sufficient to cover all expenses related to&#13;
operations including administration, adequate maintenance, taxes, payments in lieu of taxes, and&#13;
interest and other charges on debt; and (2) in fiscal 1998 a rate of return on its capital base not&#13;
less than 10 percent and each subsequent fiscal year such rate as may be permissible under the&#13;
Electricity Act or prescribed by the Regulatory Commission, whichever is higher. Returns&#13;
allowed by the Regulator under the new regulatory regime would be subject to performance&#13;
standards as regulated by the Regulator or initially laid down in the lease contracts (Annex 2.3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.5&#13;
Page 7 of 11&#13;
17.   GRIDCO will incur a loss in FY97, the first year after OSEB restructuring. It would&#13;
cover its cash operating costs, but not full depreciation. This is because of additional cost of&#13;
hydro power for about Rs 600 million due to higher repair and maintenance expenditure, higher&#13;
depreciation based on revalued assets, and higher return; and additional cost of about Rs 1,000&#13;
million due to its own higher repair and maintenance expenditure and its own higher depreciation&#13;
based on revalued assets. It is considered desirable that past practice of under maintenance of&#13;
assets is set right in the new commercial environment in which the companies are expected to&#13;
operate after restructuring. ODA is proposing to provide grant funding (to be transferred to&#13;
GRIDCO as equity) to meet expenditure on repair and maintenance for the first year of&#13;
GRIDCO's operation.&#13;
18.   From FY98 GRIDCO is expected to earn returns in line with the agreed financial&#13;
objectives. This would be possible if the expected tariff increase of about 16%, effective July 96,&#13;
is approved for FY97. A further increase of about 18% would also be needed in FY98, to fully&#13;
cover its operating costs including interest expenses. These projected tariff increases would be&#13;
sufficient to enable GRIDCO to substantially increase its returns after interest on historical net&#13;
fixed assets in FY98, from statutory 3% to 9% (based on the existing provisions of the Electricity&#13;
Supply Act). Thereafter, assuming the 16% return on equity is achieved each year, returns would&#13;
continue to be much higher compared to the historical performance of OSEB. It would also&#13;
represent much better performance than any other SEB in India has recorded in recent years.&#13;
Tariff increases assumed from FY99 onwards to achieve a return on equity of not less than 16% --&#13;
no increase in FY99, 4 % in FY2000 and 5.5% in FY2001 -- are considered reasonable. This is&#13;
however predicated on consistent reduction in T&amp;D losses, from estimated 39.5% for FY97 to&#13;
22.7% by FY2001- a reduction of about 17% points in a period of five years. This is considered&#13;
feasible with privatization of distribution; improvement in metering being supported under the&#13;
project; improvement in billing and collection owing to institutional development supported&#13;
under the project; and increased accountability of the companies to the Regulator. At&#13;
negotiations agreement was reached that GRIDCO will from fiscal 1998 not incur any debt,&#13;
unless a reasonable forecast of the revenues and expenditures of GRIDCO show that the&#13;
estimated net revenues of GRIDCO for each financial year during the term of the debt to be&#13;
incurred would be at least 1.5 times the estimated debt service requirements of GRIDCO in such&#13;
year on all debt of GRIDCO, including the debt to be incurred. GRIDCO's financial projections&#13;
show that it should be able to meet the 1.5 times target comfortably from FY98.&#13;
19.   Working Capital. Working capital requirements in FY97 will be significant because the&#13;
volume of electricity receivables will increase due to higher sales (OPGC's lb Units 1-2 will have&#13;
been commissioned); increase in level of maintenance stocks since only about Rs 150 million out&#13;
of Rs 656 million worth of stocks are estimated to be in usable condition. ODA's proposed sector&#13;
grant will finance increase in level of operations and maintenance inventory for the first three&#13;
years. This is designed to ensure availability of O&amp;M inventory for satisfactory maintenance of&#13;
the system. Even though volume of receivables is expected to go up due to higher level of sales,&#13;
in relative terms the level of unpaid electricity accounts is expected to reduce from 75 days to&#13;
about 60 days equivalent. In addition, reductions in accounts payables for power purchased,&#13;
(through better financial discipline by GRIDCO), are expected to come down in two years to&#13;
equivalent of 60 days, compared to about 161 days estimated for OSEB in FY96.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.5&#13;
Page 8 of II&#13;
20.   Billing and Collection. GRIDCO's ability to self-finance its investment program and meet&#13;
its debt service obligations depends on collecting its bills on time. OSEB has initiated a program&#13;
to improve its electricity metering through the procurement of static meters for sub-stations and&#13;
high tension consumers under Credit 1356-IN. In addition, under the proposed loan, GRIDCO&#13;
will purchase 700,000 energy meters for other consumers, which are expected to be installed over&#13;
two years. After the installation of these meters and improvements to billing and collection&#13;
systems with the support of the consultants providing institution building technical assistance, it is&#13;
expected that the metering, billing, and collection system will be more effective. As a matter of&#13;
prudent financial policy GRIDCO will make a provision for bad and doubtful debts of at least&#13;
15% of incremental receivables every year. This is considered adequate.&#13;
21.   At negotiations agreement was reached that GRIDCO would maintain in FY97 and&#13;
thereafter accounts receivable at a level not exceeding two months average billing, and accounts&#13;
payable not exceeding two months equivalent of purchases. OSEB's gross receivables for sale of&#13;
power are estimated to be Rs. 5,587 million at the end of fiscal 96, against which OSEB shall&#13;
have provision of Rs. 3,997 million for uncollectible receivables. The level of provision made by&#13;
OSEB does not necessarily represent the level of uncollectibles but is established to bring net&#13;
receivables to a level equivalent to two months sales, before transferring it to GRIDCO. To&#13;
ensure that GRIDCO will maintain its collection efficiency at an acceptable level it has been&#13;
agreed that GRIDCO will reflect in its accounts the provision for uncollectible receivables&#13;
transferred to it from OSEB, distinctly from from any provision for uncollectibles that it may&#13;
create in the future. To establish GRIDCO's compliance with the accounts receivables covenant&#13;
its receivables will be reduced only by the amount of the April 1,1996 provision ( net of future&#13;
write-offs if any against the April 1,996 transfer provision). In addition to the monitoring of the&#13;
receivables covenant, implementation of improvements to the billing and collection system will be&#13;
closely followed up by Bank supervision missions and through regular progress reports by&#13;
GRIDCO to the Bank.&#13;
22.   Financing Plan. GRIDCO's detailed financing plan is provided in Attachment I to&#13;
Annex 2.3. A summary is given in Table 2. The investment program includes reform&#13;
expenditures, which will be capitalized and recovered through future tariffs. The plan shows&#13;
investments of about US$1.0 billion to be financed: 24% by internal cash generation, 2% from&#13;
equity and other contributions by the Orissa government, 8% by ODA grant to be transferred&#13;
partly as equity and partly as grant to GRIDCO, and 66% by borrowing including the proposed&#13;
Bank loan of US$350 million which accounts for 35% of proposed investment program during&#13;
the period FY97 to FY2003. From LIC, IDBI, and other financiers, OSEB has in the past&#13;
received annually about Rs 1,000 million. With better financial performance GRIDCO should be&#13;
able to raise higher amounts. In the financing plan loans of about Rs 4,900 million ( annual&#13;
average Rs 1000 million) in the first five years have been assumed, which is no higher than the&#13;
levels of financing of Orissa power sector by these institutions in the past and therefore can be&#13;
considered reasonable. It should be noted that should GRIDCO need more funds in the initial&#13;
years (either due to an increase in the investment requirements and/or inability of some of the&#13;
other financiers to provide the envisaged funds), GRIDCO will be able to approach e.g. ADB,&#13;
which has indicated its willingness to consider a loan to help finance GRIDCO's future&#13;
investments. At negotiations agreement was reached that GRIDCO will furnish by December 31&#13;

each year, its 5-year financial projections, including its investment program and financing plan, for&#13;
the Bank's review and comments.&#13;
23.   Future Orissa Government/GRIDCO Financial Flows. Since GRIDCO's tariffs are set at&#13;
a level which not only covers its operating costs but also earn an adequate return on its equity,&#13;
GRIDCO's dependence on the state government for subsidizing its operating costs is eliminated;&#13;
and also its dependence on the Orissa government for meeting its investment needs is significantly&#13;
reduced. Projected loans from the Orissa government to GRIDCO and OHPC are much below&#13;
the state government's projected earnings from these entities by way of interest, electricity duties&#13;
and dividends. This is demonstrated in Annex 5.2. The flow of resources from the government to&#13;
the sector will be reversed within one year and the sector shall become a net generator of revenue&#13;
for the state government instead of being a burden on its budget.&#13;

24.   Accounting, Budgets and Aud&amp;t. GRIDCO and OBPC will maintain their accounts in&#13;
accordance with the commercial accounting system defined in the Companies Act. Their&#13;
accounting systems will also have to take into account the requirements of the Electricity (Supply)&#13;
Act of 1948. The commercial accounting system, formerly used by OSEB, is capable of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.5&#13;
Page 11 of 11&#13;
providing information required to meet the statutory requirements under the Companies Act.&#13;
However deficiencies in areas such as, maintenance of the assets register and some other internal&#13;
control measures, have been noticed in the implementation of the system. The institution building&#13;
technical assistance will help GRIDCO and OHPC modify and implement financial, accounting&#13;
and auditing systems and procedures and review accounting policies regarding income&#13;
recognition, asset classification, and provisioning etc. Until the accounting and internal control&#13;
systems are modified and implemented, GRIDCO and OHPC shall continue to maintain their&#13;
accounts and audit as per the prevailing OSEB system. Intemal audit will also be refined for&#13;
providing to the management adequate internal controls. In accordance with company law&#13;
requirements GRIDCO and OHPC will engage extemal chartered accountants to audit their&#13;
financial accounts. The proposed arrangements for the development of accounting, internal audit&#13;
and intemal control systems are considered satisfactory. At negotiations agreement was reached&#13;
that GRIDCO will from FY97: (a) have its records, accounts and financial statements (balance&#13;
sheets, statements of income and expenses and related statements) for each fiscal year audited, in&#13;
accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied, by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank; and (b) firnish to the Bank as soon as available, but in any case not later&#13;
than six months after the end of each such year, (i) certified copies of its financial statements for&#13;
such year as so audited; and (ii) the report of such audit by said auditors of such scope and in such&#13;
detail as the Bank may reasonably request. For FY97, GRIDCO's and OHPC's auditors would&#13;
be required to provide the following additional information: (a) their audit plan for the Bank's&#13;
review and comment; (b) a management letter summarizing any significant matters that have&#13;
arisen during the conduct of the audit; and (c) a description of any accounting practices being&#13;
followed by OHPC and GRIDCO that are inconsistent with Intemational Accounting Standards&#13;
and their effect on the financial statements.&#13;

ORISSA POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
GRID CORPORATION OF ORISSA&#13;
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS&#13;
Operating Statement&#13;
I .    Energy Availability: Power purchases are projected from OHPC, OPGC, NTPC and&#13;
other current suppliers of power to Orissa based on (a) firm power estimates for hydro&#13;
generation, (b) Orissa's share from central sector plants, and (c) contracted generation from&#13;
OPGC. OPGC's units shall be fully operational in FY 97. Talcher plant now sold to NTPC is&#13;
expected to increase power generation in a phased improvement of PLF to 62% in five years.&#13;
GRIDCO will be able to draw power from first unit (210 MW) of AES's lb stations from FY&#13;
2000 and the second unit (210 MW) from FY 2001. Power from Upper Indravati (600 MW) shall&#13;
be available from FY 2001; from the first unit of a new 500 MW private Thermal generation from&#13;
FY 2002; and second unit from FY 2003.&#13;
2.    T&amp;D Losses: In the past T&amp;D losses have been understated and average billed revenue&#13;
from some consumer categories, especially, domestic, commercial and LT industry, have been&#13;
lower than even the minimum tariff. In the absence of any quantitative/technical measurement of&#13;
losses, the estimates provided by Orissa's consultants (Monenco: Load Forecast Report - Power&#13;
System Planning in Orissa) are used.&#13;
3.    Electricity Sales: The mix of estimated electricity sales to the various categories of&#13;
consumers in FY 1996 is maintained while projecting the category-wise sales for FY 97. In&#13;
subsequent years, estimates of sales provided by Orissa's consultants (MIS Monenco) are used.&#13;
Income Statement&#13;
4.    Revenue and Tariffs: Tariffs increased by about 17% effective November 1995. A&#13;
further increase of about 16% on an annual basis is projected from July 96 for GRlDCO to meet&#13;
its cash operating costs. For FY 98 a 18% increase in tariff is assumed for achieving the financial&#13;
targets of 20% SFR and 10% return on equity. Tariffs are thereafter set to obtain a minimum of&#13;
16% return on equity and 25% SFR.&#13;
5.    Other Income: This comprises of interest income on short term investment of surplus&#13;
cash; advances to suppliers; and delayed payment charges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.5&#13;
Attachment 3&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
6.    Cost of Power Purchase: Contracted or current average rates have been used as the base.&#13;
It is assumed that GRIDCO will dispatch power first from plants for which it has a "take-or-pay"&#13;
contract (i.e. AES, OPGC and NTPC (Talcher) and then in order of average tariff For hydro&#13;
plants, 10% and for thermal plants 25% of the base cost is assumed to be variable. This variable&#13;
component is assumed to increase by the average inflation for the year.&#13;
7.    Operation and Maintenance: These comprise of: a) repair and maintenance cost of 5% of&#13;
gross fixed assets including new investments (hence these expenses are not adjusted for inflation)&#13;
as compared to an inadequate level of about 3-3.5% of Gross fixed assets in the past. In FY97 a&#13;
quantum increase in repair &amp; maintenance ( Rs. 601 million compared to about Rs 160 million in&#13;
FY96) is provided for; b) Employee, Administration and general expenses are adjusted for&#13;
inflation and annual salary increments.&#13;
8.    Other Expenses: Projected on basis of past trend of expenses of OSEB.&#13;
9.    Electricity Duty: Projected at the existing rate of 12.34 paise/kWh. However, this being&#13;
a tax collection on behalf of the State Government, it does not impact on the finances of&#13;
GRIDCO.&#13;
10.   Depreciation: The average depreciation for GRIDCO is taken at 6.83% on revalued&#13;
gross fixed assets in use for the full year.&#13;
11.   Interest Charges: Interest and repayment terms for various loans are as given below:&#13;

12.   Interest and Expenses Capitalized: Interest on long term loans and expenses incurred&#13;
prior to commissioning of assets are capitalized and funded through long term sources.&#13;
13.   Taxes: No tax liability is assumed since the depreciation allowable under the Income Tax&#13;
Act 1961, exceeds the taxable income. In addition, depreciation on which tax deduction is not&#13;
claimed can be carried forward for setting-off against taxable income in future years.&#13;
14.   Dividend on Share Capital: GRIDCO is expected to pay dividends ftom FY 2000&#13;
onwards at the rate of 16% on paid-up capital every year.&#13;

Balance Sheet&#13;
15.   Revaluation of Fixed Assets: The fixed assets are revalued at depreciated replacement&#13;
cost. Out of Rs 11,200 million, the amount of revaluation, plus Rs 740 million in the restructuring&#13;
account, reduced by Rs 3,012 million of subsidy due from GOO, Rs 506 million for obsolete&#13;
stocks, and Rs 392 million additional provision for receivables, the net addition to assets on&#13;
account of revaluation is Rs 8,030 million. Against this amount GRIDCO has issued partially&#13;
convertible bond of Rs 4,000 million and share capital of Rs 2,530 million to GOO. OSEB has&#13;
unfunded terminal benefit liabilities, currently estimated at Rs 1,500 million, to employees&#13;
transferred to GRIDCO. Instead of reducing the value of assets acquired from GOO and&#13;
assuming terminal benefit obligation as a contingent liability (off-balance sheet) to be met as and&#13;
when these arise, GRIDCO has decided to reflect assets at its full value and issue partially&#13;
convertible bond of Rs 1,500 million to Employees Trust Fund .&#13;
16.   Partially Convertible Bonds: Bonds of value Rs 5,500 million will be issued on account&#13;
of revaluation cost of the assets transferred to GRIDCO. Of these bonds, Rs 1,500 million worth&#13;
of bonds corresponding to OSEB's liability on account of unfunded employee terminal benefits,&#13;
will be issued to an employee trust fund. This will be redeemed in ten equal annual installments&#13;
from year 6 through 15. It will not carry any interest for first five years but earn 13% from year 6&#13;
onwards till redemption. For the balance amount of Rs 4,000 million GRIDCO shall issue a bond&#13;
to GOO. These bonds will comprise of two parts: Part A 50%, will be converted to equity, at the&#13;
option of the holder, in three equal installments, in the 6th, 8th and 10th years. Part B 50%, shall&#13;
remain a debenture which shall attract interest at 13% per annum until redemption. The bond&#13;
does not carry any interest for the first five years.&#13;
17.   Equity: The initial equity of Rs 3,262 million consists of: a) conversion of GOO loans of&#13;
Rs 732 million, and b) issue of equity of Rs 2,530 million to GOO on account of part of&#13;
revaluation of assets. Additions in future years are on account of grants from ODA which are&#13;
routed through GOO as equity to GRIDCO and part conversion of partially convertible Bonds.&#13;
18.   Consumer Contributions: Assumed to increase at 10% per annum.&#13;
19.  Investment: Investment program is based on requirements estimated by GRIDCO's&#13;
consultants.&#13;
20.   Stocks: O&amp;M stocks necessary for facilitating adequate maintenance and immediate&#13;
replacement of damaged equipment are projected to be Rs 790 million. These stocks will be built&#13;
up during FY 1997-99 and will be funded by a grant from ODA which will be made available to&#13;
GRIDCO by GOO as equity. It is estimated that, of the current inventory of Rs 656 million&#13;
available with OSEB, inventory worth only about Rs 150 is in usable condition and the balance is&#13;
either obsolete or unusable.&#13;

22.   Receivables for Sale of Power: Projected as equivalent to 60 days of sales.&#13;
23.   Provisions for Bad and Doubtful Debts: Maintained at a level equal to 15% of gross&#13;
receivables for the first three years and 25% thereafter.&#13;
24.   Inventories: Capital inventories are projected as equivalent to 30 days consumption of&#13;
capital stores. Consumable stores are projected as equivalent to 12 months of repair and&#13;
maintenance expenditure for the first three years, 9 months in FY 2000 and from FY 2001&#13;
onwards to 6 months consumption levels.&#13;
25.   Payables: (a) purchase of capital stores: 30 days equivalent of purchases of capital&#13;

ORISSA POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION REHABILITATION&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    A Power System Planning study was carried out in Orissa to prepare a new transmission&#13;
system master plan for Orissa and to prepare a program for improving the performance of the&#13;
distribution system. The results of the load forecast and planning work carried out are being used&#13;
to support other activities beyond the immediate scope of this one. These include tariff studies,&#13;
preparation of financial projections and review of the justification of planned new generation&#13;
projects. On the job training of OSEB (now GRIDCO) engineering staff was also provided.&#13;
Computer hardware and software for transmission and distribution system planning was&#13;
purchased for use in the study and transferred to OSEB (now GRIDCO). The study comprised&#13;
the following key activities:&#13;
* Forecast total electricity demand for the state for a fifteen year period 1996-20 10.&#13;
Forecasts of individual main substation loads and customer class loads are to be prepared&#13;
for a ten year period 1996-2005.&#13;
*  Find the most economic generation expansion plan for Orissa. Review the overall&#13;
resources balance of the integrated Eastern Region (Bihar, Orissa, Sikkim and West&#13;
Bengal).&#13;
* Prepare a transmission system master plan for Orissa for the next ten years, 1996-2005.&#13;
*  Identify and evaluate measures to bring about a rapid improvement in the capability of the&#13;
distribution systems to reduce losses, reduce overloading and improve the voltage.&#13;
Define, set priorities for and establish a data collection program to allow longer term&#13;
distribution planning to be carried out with confidence.&#13;
* Assess OSEB's planning needs and select and obtain appropriate computer hardware and&#13;
software for power system planning. Provide on the job training to key OSEB staff in the&#13;
use of the hardware and software.&#13;
TRANSMISSION&#13;
Overview of Orissa 's Transmission System&#13;
2.    The transmission system of Orissa consists of 3,935 circuit km of 132 kV, 3,315 circuit&#13;
km of 220 kV and 1,058 circuit km of 400 kV lines interconnecting the major generating stations&#13;
with the load centers through 5515 MVA of transformer capacity. The 132 kV and 220 kV lines&#13;
are owned and operated by OSEB whereas the 400 kV lines are owned and operated by Power&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.1&#13;
Page 2 of 13&#13;
Grid Corporation of India (POWERGRID). The OSEB system operates in synchronism with&#13;
member utilities of the Eastern Region Electricity Board (EREB). In addition to connections to&#13;
West Bengal and Bihar, Orissa is connected to parts of the Andhra Pradesh State Electricity&#13;
Board system by a 220 kV line from Balimela and a 132 kV line from Machkund hydro plant.&#13;
The 220 kV line is used to supply power to Upper Sileru, which is usually operated in isolation&#13;
from the rest of the Andhra Pradesh system. The 132 kV line brings power from Machkund to&#13;
Vizag and is synchronized with the rest of the Andhra Pradesh system. For this reason the&#13;
Machkund generation and part of the Orissa load is operated in isolation from the Orissa system.&#13;
The Orissa system is also connected to part of the Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board grid by&#13;
a 220 kV double circuit line from Budhipadar to Korba. The single circuit Jayanagar-Rengali-&#13;
Kolaghat (West Bengal) line connects the Upper Kolab generation located in southwestern Orissa&#13;
to Talcher and Rengali generation in the central part of the state and connects the Orissa grid with&#13;
West Bengal. The line is designed for 400 kV but the section from Jayanagar to Rengali is&#13;
presently operated at 220 kV.&#13;
TRANSMISSION PLANNING&#13;
3.    All loads were modeled at the 220 or 132 kV buses with the exception of specific major&#13;
industrial loads that are connected at 33 kV or 11 kV. Power system studies (load flow, short&#13;
circuit and stability studies) were performed to examine the integration of new generation into the&#13;
Orissa transmission grid. This was done to help ensure that the grid is capable of delivering&#13;
power from the generating plants to the load centers under established criteria. A horizon year&#13;
approach to transmission planning was taken. The transmission system in 2010, the last year of&#13;
the 1996-20 10 planning period, was examined. The system additions needed to ensure that the&#13;
power output of the generation in service in 2010 can be delivered to the load centers under the&#13;
set of planning criteria is determined. A study horizon of 2010 was taken since it would lead to&#13;
more appropriate conclusions regarding specific new transmission lines and voltage levels. The&#13;
horizon year system was examined under a variety of generation and load conditions. If the&#13;
transmission system is inadequate, additional transmission system equipment is needed. The&#13;
equipment may include new transmission lines, additional compensation or additional terminal&#13;
equipment. The objective was to add equipment that minimizes the present worth cost while&#13;
meeting transmission design criteria. Costs include investments, operation and maintenance&#13;
expenses and the cost of losses.&#13;
4.    Based on the insights gained through-investigation of the horizon year, a transmission plan&#13;
that builds toward the horizon year is developed. The plan covers the June 1995 system as well&#13;
as time slices (2002 and 2007) taken during the fifteen year planning period. A series of studies&#13;
were carried out to determine the most suitable alternative to meet the growing demand with two&#13;
possible generating conditions: maximum hydro and maximum thermal generation. The voltage&#13;
levels available for expansion consist of 132 kV, 220 kV and 400 kV, all voltages presently used&#13;
in Orissa. The use of high voltage direct current (HVDC) and 765 kV AC was ruled out since&#13;
Orissa has relatively short distances between the generation and load centers. System investment&#13;
requirements up to year 2010, showing separately 400 kV and 220 kV lines, 132 kV lines,&#13;
transformers and reactors and capacitors to be added, are presented in the study report on&#13;
transmission (paras. 34-39).&#13;
&#13;

IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM&#13;
5.    This section presents the investment program and schedule for the first years of the&#13;
proposed transmission expansion plan, up to 2002, supported under the project. The investment&#13;
program is shown for each of the major items considered in section 6. It includes 400 and 220 kV&#13;
development, 132 kV development, transformer additions and capacitor and reactor requirements.&#13;
400 k V and 220 k V Development&#13;
6.    Over the next six years, Orissa needs to add some 530 km (1,070 circuit km) of&#13;
transmission lines operating at 400 kV. Table I shows the investment needed for each of the&#13;
proposed lines and switchgear. The total investment required is Rs 452 crore.&#13;
7.    The 220 kV system additions call for the construction of over 1,000 km (2,026 circuit km)&#13;
of transmission lines and several new substations and additions to existing substations. The&#13;
investment required for each of the proposed lines and associated switchgear is also shown in&#13;
Table 1. The total investment required is Rs 411 crore.&#13;
8.    The total cost for the combined 400 and 220 kV transmission is Rs 863 crore (Table 1).&#13;
Implementation of all proposed projects should start at the earliest possible time to ensure that in&#13;
the future the generation can be delivered reliably to the load centers.&#13;
132 kVDevelopment&#13;
9.    In addition to the OSEB committed lines, the 132 kV system will require nearly 400 km&#13;
(497 circuit km) of transmission additions over the next six years. All of these lines should be&#13;
implemented as soon as possible to alleviate the present and expected overloads in the 132 kV&#13;
system. Table 2 shows the investment associated with each of the lines and switchgear. The total&#13;
investment is Rs 121 crore. The investment shown here does not include the costs associated with&#13;
the committed lines but include the costs for the proposed lines, which are require to improve the&#13;
distribution system performance (all costs are included in the financial analysis).&#13;
Other Substation Equipment&#13;
10.   With the expansion of the network and growing loads, several transformers will be&#13;
required to connect the different voltage levels in the system. Table 3 shows the investment&#13;
required for each of the transformers. The total investment required for transformers and&#13;
switching equipment amounts to Rs 331 crore. The timing of transformer additions is dictated by&#13;
the load requirements and the commissioning of 400 and 220 kV lines. The transformers shown&#13;
in Table 3 should be added by 2002. The above costs do not include costs of committed&#13;
transformers nor that of generator transformers. (all costs are included in the financial analysis, the&#13;
cost of generator transformers is included in the capital cost of the particular generating station).&#13;
11.   Capacitor and reactors are also required by the system to obtain satisfactory system&#13;
performance. The investment required for this equipment is shown in Table 4 and amounts to Rs&#13;
29 crore. The capacitors are needed by the system as soon as possible to improve the overall&#13;

voltage profile and system performance. The in-service date of the reactors should coincide with&#13;
that of the lines they are associated with.&#13;

DISTRIBUTION STUDY&#13;
OVERVIEW OF ORISSA 'S DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM&#13;
13.   The distribution systems in Orissa are supplied through 132 kV to 33 kV grid substations.&#13;
There are fifty 132/33 kV grid supply points within the state. The systems are radial, operating at&#13;
33 kV and 11 kV in which 33 kV is used as a subtransmission voltage. Some interconnection&#13;
exists between the radial circuits in the more heavily loaded urban areas and those areas&#13;
designated for industrial expansion. In many locations both 33 kV and 11 kV systems have been&#13;
constructed side by side, particularly in the rural areas where they parallel each other for hundreds&#13;
of kilometers. The low voltage systems operate at 400 volts three phase with single phase&#13;
customers supplied at 230 volts. In both the urban and rural areas the low voltage systems are&#13;
extensive and emanate radially from distribution transformers which range in size up to 500 kVA&#13;
and 100 kVA respectively. The system frequency is 50 Hz.&#13;
14.   The distribution systems are divided into operational areas called circles. The circles, of&#13;
which there are ten, define the electrical boundaries of each of the systems. Each of the circles is&#13;
more or less energy autonomous with sufficient grid system capacity to supply the load within the&#13;
circle. Some have limited interconnection at 33 kV. Such an interconnection is mainly for&#13;
standby purposes and not to supply load on a regular basis.&#13;
15.   The distribution system has deteriorated to the point where it can no longer meet its&#13;
operational requirements. While the constraints imposed by the shortage of funds have&#13;
contributed to its present condition, many tasks particularly those related to maintenance could&#13;
have been carried out. The ongoing decline in system performance, signaled by the increased&#13;
frequency and duration of outages, could have been less rapid. The overloading of distribution&#13;
transformers has become endemic with as many as three thousand reported to be replaced each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.1&#13;

year, many having failed from overloading. The apparent high level of technical losses is&#13;
contributed to not only by the poor power factor but also by some design practices. Many 11 kV&#13;
and 33 kV circuits have small conductors that are loaded beyond the optimum level for loss&#13;
reduction and control. Other design features, such as the practice of constructing long secondary&#13;
circuits in both urban and rural areas supplied from one centrally located transformer, also&#13;
contribute to high losses.&#13;
System Analysis&#13;
16.   Computer hardware and software were purchased under the technical assistance to&#13;
provide OSEB with a capability to carry out studies relating to distribution planning,. The&#13;
software selected was ABB's CADPAW program, which has load flow, short circuit and motor&#13;
starting analysis modules. As part of the training of OSEB counterpart staff in using of&#13;
CADPAW, several 33 kV circuits were modeled to show the application of the program. OSEB's&#13;
engineers continued with the modeling of the 33 kV system under the guidance of the consultant.&#13;
This continued effort has resulted in the completion of the modeling of all the 33 kV feeders and&#13;
many 11 kV feeders. The outcome of this work is that a complete picture of the condition of the&#13;
33 kV system is available showing circuit load and voltage profiles and losses. The results of the&#13;
analysis show that abnormally low voltages, in some instances voltage drops of over 30%, are&#13;
experienced in every distribution circle.&#13;
Short Term Measures&#13;
17.   Several measures to improve system performance that can be quickly carried out were&#13;
identified and evaluated. These are&#13;
* Increasing distribution transformer capacity&#13;
* Installation of capacitors&#13;
* Improving feeder and loading arrangements&#13;
* Installation of express feeders&#13;
Distribution Transformer Capacity&#13;
18.   To define transformers that are overloaded and require off loading, the criteria adopted is&#13;
that transformers with a peak load of more than 80% would be reduced to a load level of 60%.&#13;
Overloaded transformers were identified through load measurements. Over four hundred&#13;
transformer load readings were taken. Of these, it was found that 22% of the transformers were&#13;
loaded to 80% or more of their rating and 11% were loaded more than 100% of their rating.&#13;
Based on the results of the load analysis, estimates were made of the additional transformers&#13;
capacity required in each distribution circle based on the criterion previously described. The&#13;
investment required to augment the transformer capacity is broken down by circle in Table 5. The&#13;
investment includes the additional 11 kV overhead line required to supply the transformers. The&#13;
results are summarized as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Increase in Capacity                           28.7%&#13;
Cost of Additions                              80.2 Rs crore&#13;
Installation of Capacitors&#13;
19.   The benefits to be derived from the installation of capacitors on distribution systems are&#13;
well documented. Besides reducing losses, capacitor installations also reduce the feeder and&#13;
system peak demand and improve the voltage profile. Table 6 shows the amount of capacitance&#13;
to be added in each circle based on typical power factors assumed and the cost. The quantities&#13;
have been calculated based on the assumption that the existing load power factor is 0.80 and that&#13;
it will be corrected to 0.98. The cost estimate assumes that the switched and unswitched&#13;
capacitors will be of equal size. Some 367 MVAR of capacitance is required at a total cost of Rs&#13;
91.8 crore. A statewide installation program could be completed in thirty months.&#13;
System Rationalization and Load Balancing&#13;
Low Voltage Systems&#13;
20.   In the development of distribution systems a tendency often arises by which the system&#13;
evolves somewhat randomly without regard for the impact on losses and load distribution. This&#13;
is particularly true where planning does not have a high priority and reporting systems are not&#13;
strictly followed. In such circumstances it is desirable that a rationalization of the system takes&#13;
place from time to time. This process cannot be described as an engineering activity but is more a&#13;
common sense look at how the system has evolved. It involves the study of single line and&#13;
topographical drawings to decide where potential studies can be made to evaluate different&#13;
feeding and loading arrangements. It can also be used to decide where potential benefits may lie&#13;
by installing express feeders as described below.&#13;
21.   Several actual cases were selected for the rationalization of the low voltage (LV) system.&#13;
It was demonstrated that simple measures such as relocating the distribution transformer to the&#13;
load center or dividing a network supplying a load area into two parts, each supplied by a separate&#13;
transformer, could reduce losses significantly. Costs and benefits of the cases analyzed showed&#13;
attractive payback periods, sometimes shorter than one year. If these benefits are applied to all&#13;
transformers in the system rated at 100 kVA, the present worth of savings from load balancing&#13;
could be as high as Rs 280 crore. This assumes that similar problems to those identified in the&#13;
case studies exist statewide.&#13;
33 kV and 11 kV Systems&#13;
22.   The comments made in relation to these voltage levels are based on the systems in&#13;
Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. Consider first the 33 kV system since some problems that exist at 11&#13;
kV are the result of the practices adopted at 33 kV. In both cities and particularly in Cuttack&#13;
many 33/1 1 kV substations are badly located to efficiently supply their loads. In Bhubaneswar, at&#13;
least 50% of the 33/11 kV substations have been located on the perimeter of the city and supply&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.1&#13;
Page 7 of 13&#13;
load through a radius of 1800. This is instead of being located in or near the load center and&#13;
allowing feeders to radiate in all directions. In Cuttack this situation is much more acute with&#13;
almost all the stations being located on the outer perimeter of the city. It is recognized that in&#13;
Cuttack congested streets and limited land availability may have influenced these decisions.&#13;
However, by adopting appropriate designs for substations and 33 kV lines, substations could be&#13;
relocated to significantly reduce losses.&#13;
Benefits from Load Balancing&#13;
23.   A further low cost measure that can affect both losses and transformer loading, and which&#13;
is not obvious from a review of the system configuration, is the balancing of the feeder loads.&#13;
While this activity requires the collection of data, it is a relatively simple process and one that can&#13;
produce considerable benefits. Carrying out a load balancing program may well reduce the&#13;
number of transformer failures.&#13;
24.   Load unbalance readings were taken as part of the data collection process for the review&#13;
of the transformer capacity. An estimate of the increase in losses system-wide was arrived at&#13;
using the average of the difference in the losses established for the sample of approximately 400&#13;
transformers of different sizes. This average increase in the losses was applied to the total losses&#13;
established for the LV system in the analysis of the technical losses to provide a kW figure and&#13;
from that an estimated annual cost. This annual figure was used to derive a present worth value&#13;
of the losses for the next ten year period. The present worth value is estimated to be Rs 59.4&#13;
crore and could be saved by load balancing, which is a relatively low cost measure.&#13;
Express Feeders&#13;
25.   The express feeder is a transporter of energy. It is used to reinforce areas of the system&#13;
where the load does not merit the installation of a new substation. These feeders typically use&#13;
large cross section conductors (200 mm2 or more) and are constructed on large poles to allow the&#13;
use of longer span lengths. They may be used at either 11 kV or 33 kV and are generally more&#13;
suited to urban locations rather than rural areas where the topography of the system does not&#13;
normally lend itself to their use. They should be routed directly to the area they are intended to&#13;
reinforce without tap-offs or other connections, which may integrate them into the system and&#13;
reduce their usefulness. To carry out this study, two feeders were selected that had been analyzed&#13;
using the CADPAW program for the 11 kV to 33 kV voltage conversion analysis. The results of&#13;
this analysis show that the use of express feeders is economic for supporting weaker parts of the&#13;
11 kV system in the urban areas. To find the cost of installing express feeders on the system at&#13;
those locations where they are needed will require a detailed investigation of each 11 kV system.&#13;
It was beyond the scope of this study to carry out this analysis. However, an overall cost estimate&#13;
has been made. The cost of installing beneficial express feeders is estimated at Rs 15.5 crore.&#13;
Reinforcing of 33 kV Lines&#13;
26.   Some of the short term measures recommended for the resolution of problems on the II&#13;
kV system apply equally well to the 33 kV system. These measures include the application of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.1&#13;
Page 8 of 13&#13;
capacitors, rationalizing the system, balancing of loads and the use of express feeders in urban&#13;
areas. The CADPAW analysis of the 33 kV feeders revealed many locations where the voltage is&#13;
up to 25% lower than the nominal voltage. In many of these cases the solution will be the&#13;
construction of new 132/33 kV substations, which in addition to improving the voltage will also&#13;
reduce losses.&#13;
Long Term Measures&#13;
27.   The main additional long term measure for reducing losses and increasing the capacity of&#13;
the distribution system, along with conventional capacity reinforcement, is the conversion of the&#13;
11 kV system to 33 kV. The effect of converting the 11 kV feeders to 33 kV would provide an&#13;
immediate tripling of the capacity of the system and a reduction in losses by a factor of nine. It&#13;
would eliminate the need for investment in 33/11 kV substations, resolve all 11 kV voltage drop&#13;
and loading problems, and reduce technical losses. Without this conversion, investment will be&#13;
required in both the II kV and 33 kV systems, which in effect will be the same as rebuilding two&#13;
distribution systems. The construction of the two systems is so similar that conversion of the&#13;
overhead lines to the higher voltage can be carried out with very little investment and in most&#13;
cases by only modifying the cross-arm. Given the fact that an increase of up to 25% is required in&#13;
both distribution and 33/11 kV transformer capacity, simply to upgrade the system to an&#13;
acceptable standard makes conversion a logical solution.&#13;
28.   The results of the analysis demonstrate that for a range of feeder loads, on feeders with&#13;
differing topography and feeders located in both rural and urban areas 33 kV is nearly always&#13;
more economic than 11 kV. By making a decision to eliminate the 11 kV system based on the&#13;
results of this study, investment in the 11 kV system and the 33/11 kV substations that supply it&#13;
can be eliminated. In those instances where interim reinforcement is required, it can be provided,&#13;
for example by the construction of express feeders. The express feeders can be constructed for 33&#13;
kV, initially operated at 11 kV and integrated into the 33 kV system at a later date. The condition&#13;
of the existing 11 kV and 33 kV distribution systems throughout the state makes an action plan&#13;
imperative.&#13;
29.   The findings of the feasibility study were applied to the whole system to produce a voltage&#13;
conversion program and an investment schedule. A period of five years is considered a&#13;
reasonable time frame to implement such a program and this period has been used in developing&#13;
the investment schedule. The estimates of line and transformer costs developed as part of the&#13;
feasibility study were reduced to costs of rupees per kVA of load supplied for both urban and&#13;
rural systems. These unit costs were used to develop conversion costs for each circle based on&#13;
the connected 33/11 kV transformer capacity. The priorities of conversion were established by&#13;
reviewing the load on all 33/11 kV transformers and including those loaded to 80% or more of&#13;
their rating into the first two years of the program. This method of assigning the priorities will&#13;
ensure that a minimum of investment is assigned to 33/11 kV substations, which following&#13;
conversion will become redundant. Table 7 summarizes the investment by year and circle for each&#13;
of the five years of the proposed investment program.&#13;

Losses&#13;

30.   Estimated actual technical losses (from Table 8) and realistic target levels for technical&#13;
losses are listed by component below, adding up to 23% and about 11%, respectively&#13;

31.   Unlike non-technical losses, the control and reduction of technical losses require large&#13;
investments in plant and equipment to reduce them and more modest investment to maintain&#13;
control. In the present situation the reduction of technical losses in Orissa must come through&#13;
investment. The proposed 11 to 33 kV conversion program, if implemented, will resolve the loss&#13;
problem on the 11 kV circuits, the 11/0.4 kV transformers and to some extent the low voltage&#13;
circuits as 33/0.4 kV transformers are added and the low voltage system is rationalized. The&#13;
reduction of losses on the 33 kV circuits will come through the construction of some new 132/33&#13;
kV substations and through the construction of new 33 kV lines. In the urban areas the use of&#13;
new large capacity express feeders to upgrade the 33 kV system will make a significant&#13;
contribution to loss reduction. The control of the losses will come through the optimization of all&#13;
system components and a vigorous monitoring program. It is essential that planning for loss&#13;
control becomes a major focus of all distribution planning activities. It usually follows that if&#13;
losses are under control most other aspects are also in good order.&#13;
Non-technical Losses&#13;
32.   A three stage program for reducing and controlling non-technical losses was developed&#13;
and is outlined below.&#13;
First Stage (detailed planning and design)&#13;
* A definition of the size of the problem in terms of the number of users not identified in the&#13;
billing system&#13;
* A definition of the number of customers recorded in the billing system who have some&#13;
form of fraudulent installation other than a damaged meter&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.1&#13;
Page 1O of 13&#13;
* A definition of the number of service installations that are required to be replaced to&#13;
reduce the opportunity for illegal connections&#13;
* Identification of the areas where loss reduction measures will prove most effective in&#13;
terms of cost and form a basis to set priorities among the activities&#13;
* Develop programs for field implementation to be completed in a reasonable period&#13;
* Define the resources and training required for the carrying out the field programs&#13;
* Define the procedures and electronic data processing system to be adopted for managing&#13;
the rehabilitation of client/user installations and the procedure for incorporation into the&#13;
billing system&#13;
* Define the procedures to be applied for the verification and control of clients/users&#13;
detected with illegal or illicit connections to ensure continued compliance&#13;
* Define the criteria for the application of punitive measures&#13;
* Define the scope of the public relations campaign and identify suitable producers&#13;
* Define the criteria for measuring performance and success&#13;
Second Stage (field implementation)&#13;
* The deployment and control of field crews&#13;
* Install meters, rehabilitate service connections and remove illegal connections and&#13;
installations&#13;
* Process supply contracts and incorporate users into the billing system&#13;
*  Evaluate monetary penalties to be applied where applicable. This will normally apply only&#13;
for the theft of large blocks of power&#13;
* Carrying out the public relations campaign&#13;
Third Stage (monitoring)&#13;
The third stage will include ongoing monitoring of the situation. As the initial inspection&#13;
programs continue, more resources will be diverted to the control and verification of newly&#13;
reformed clients, particularly in the categories where consumption is highest. The stage will&#13;
include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.1&#13;
Page I I of 13&#13;
* Carrying out programs for the reinspection of clients whose consumption pattems have&#13;
changed or returned to zero&#13;
* Carrying out ongoing, rotating, random inspection programs of large consumers&#13;
* Provide for the application of legal measures&#13;
* Ongoing monitoring of project performance and loss levels&#13;
* Carry out a survey of public reaction&#13;
Implementation Program For The Distribution System Improvement Measures&#13;
Summary of Measures&#13;
33.   This section outlines the measures recommended for implementation and applies in&#13;
particular to the short term measures, which are intended to provide for rapid improvements to&#13;
the system:&#13;
* Increase the distribution transformer capacity statewide and include measures to reduce&#13;
low voltage system losses&#13;
* Install capacitors on all 11 kV feeders to improve the power factor, reduce losses and&#13;
peak demand, and improve voltage profiles&#13;
* Carry out a program to decide where rationalization of the system and load balancing will&#13;
produce improvements&#13;
* Identify areas of the system where the use of express feeders will produce benefits and&#13;
provide rapid improvements in capacity. Develop an implementation program and&#13;
investment schedule&#13;
* Carry out a 11 to 33 kV voltage conversion program&#13;
* Carry out a program for the reduction of non-technical losses&#13;
* improve and maintain the database for distribution planning&#13;
* Develop a consistent set of planning criteria to ensure optimal loading of system&#13;
components with adequate operating flexibility and acceptable levels of technical losses.&#13;

Investment Schedule&#13;
34.   The time frame assumed for project execution and used as a basis for developing an&#13;
investment schedule is the shortest possible and assumes that all activities will be carried out as&#13;
turnkey projects. The cost estimates have been prepared using OSEB equipment and labor rates.&#13;
The costs for each of the recommended measures, other than rationalization and load balancing,&#13;
are summarized by circle in Table 9. The proposed implementation schedule for the whole state is&#13;
summarized below. An allowance of 30% has been added to the costs given in Table 9 to provide&#13;
for the use of contract labor. Also the amounts to be recovered from salvaging redundant 11 kV&#13;
materials have been excluded from the voltage conversion program estimate.&#13;

ORISSA POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT IN ORISSA&#13;
Background&#13;
1.   In Orissa, current power supply constraints and capital requirements for system expansion&#13;
reinforce the need to pursue demand-side initiatives to complement supply-side expansion.&#13;
Demand-side management (DSM) is defined, for the purposes of this project, as identifying and&#13;
implementing initiatives that improve the use of power supply capacity by altering the&#13;
characteristics of the demand for electricity. DSM initiatives to be implemented under the project&#13;
involve a mix of pricing, other load management and conservation strategies and investments&#13;
designed to increase the incentives and help end-users use electricity more efficiently.&#13;
2.    The power system in Orissa is currently in deficit which results in frequent load shedding&#13;
for OSEB customers during morning and evening peaks. While new supply sources are planned&#13;
and under construction, the system is still expected to remain in deficit until FY98. The Planning&#13;
Working Group has projected the Orissa power system to be able to rapidly reduce the current&#13;
shortages and from FY98 meet the projected electricity demand in terms of energy requirements.&#13;
With the commissioning of the Upper Indravati hydro project and lb units 3-4, the total peaking&#13;
capacity of the system is projected to exceed and its dependable load carrying capability&#13;
(calculated by deducting the largest generating unit from the total peaking capacity) is projected&#13;
to match the projected peak load in FY99-FY2000 and again at the time of commissioning of the&#13;
projected next 500 MW thermal project in FY2003. In the FY2001-FY2002 period, the total&#13;
peaking capacity matches the projected peak demand, i.e. the loss of a generating unit at system&#13;
peak would result in load restrictions. In the absence of a more reasonable level of reserve&#13;
capacity, the Orissa power system may therefore still experience some difficulties in meeting the&#13;
peak demand.&#13;
Potential for Demand-Side Management&#13;
3.    Bank review demonstrated that potential for load management and electricity conservation&#13;
exists in Orissa. Major opportunities for DSM.in Orissa exist in rationalizing electrical cooker&#13;
loads in the domestic sector, off-peak scheduling of municipal water pumping and low and&#13;
medium industry, effective rostering of agricultural loads and through more efficient management&#13;
and utilization of electrical energy in large industries. A conservative estimate of the potential&#13;
load reduction in these sectors (generally in the range of 10 to 25% of the estimated technical&#13;
potential), suggests an overall load reduction over the peak period of about 240 MW, or 15 % of&#13;
system capacity. Subsequent audits of selected industrial sites have confirmed opportunities to&#13;
improve efficiency while providing attractive pay-back periods. For example, a preliminary audit&#13;
of one of the municipal water pumping stations indicated that the motors and pumps could be&#13;
replaced with more efficient units while providing a pay-back of less than two years. This project&#13;
is among the DSM investments expected to be implemented under the proposed Bank loan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 2 of 12&#13;
Barriers to Demand-Side Management in Orissa&#13;
4.    The barriers or issues related to the achievement of efficient use of electricity in Orissa can&#13;
be grouped into three categories: (a) those that are under the control of the electric utility; (b)&#13;
those that result from cultural or awareness problems; and (c) those related to the infrastructure&#13;
necessary for successful programs.&#13;
5.    Utility Induced barriers. One of the necessary prerequisites of efficient electricity use is&#13;
tariffs that reflect appropriate price signals. This means that the tariff, or at least the trailing step&#13;
of the tariff, should reflect the cost of providing additional electricity supply, and the customer&#13;
should pay in accordance with the amount of electricity consumed. Today, a number of factors&#13;
are preventing the customer from receiving the appropriate price signals:&#13;
(a)   tariffs reflect neither marginal costs nor embedded costs for each sector. Some of&#13;
the domestic sector rates cover only about 40% of the costs, while the large&#13;
industrial rate recovers well over 100% of the embedded cost;&#13;
(b)   there are currently no Time of Day or Interruptible tariffs to encourage customers&#13;
to shift loads around the peak periods, although site visits indicate that there is&#13;
load which could be shifted in response to appropriate price signals. The response&#13;
to off-peak tariffs appears mixed with some categories of customers (such as one&#13;
or two shift industries) clearly interested. Further, there is a significant amount of&#13;
back-up generation installed in Orissa. This is required to allow commercial and&#13;
industrial companies to function when power quality on the OSEB system is&#13;
inadequate or power is interrupted. It has been estimated that 150 - 300 MW&#13;
might be available from this source. Appropriate price signals could encourage this&#13;
supply to become available over peak periods;&#13;
(c)    bills received by many customers do not reflect the amount of electricity&#13;
consumed. There is a high incidence of defective meters, especially in the&#13;
residential sector where it is estimated that almost 90% of the meters are defective.&#13;
In these cases, the customer is billed a flat rate based on his connected load rather&#13;
than for actual consumption. Similar problems exist in the agricultural sector.&#13;
Finally, the incidence of other commercial losses, including outright theft, is very&#13;
high. OSEB estimates this at about 20% of the electricity generated;&#13;
(d)    power quality problems, including significant voltage sag, will preclude the use of&#13;
some cost effective technologies, such as fluorescent or compact fluorescent lights&#13;
with mechanical ballasts. Voltage stabilizers can be used to compensate for&#13;
voltage problems, but this reduces cost effectiveness;&#13;
(e)   the utility also lacks some of the infrastructure, commonly available in North&#13;
American and European utilities, necessary for the development of effective DSM&#13;
programs. For example, there is no end use "appliance" or equipment data upon&#13;
which to start estimating conservation or load shifting potential. A load research&#13;
project is now being planned as currently no detailed customer level load shape&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 3 of 12&#13;
data exists. he utility does not have an energy use or customer advisory group,&#13;
and has only limited technical knowledge of customer applications or equipment.&#13;
Finally, planning for new supply has been based on generation planning&#13;
approaches, rather than some form of Integrated Resource Planning which would&#13;
attempt to balance investment in both supply and demand alternatives. The DSM&#13;
program will provide the necessary initial experience and information for wider&#13;
application of DSM and its formal incorporation into the planning process.&#13;
6.    Cultural Barriers. Even when the price signals are correct, the appropriate level of&#13;
investment in conservation or efficiency may not occur for a number of reasons relating to the&#13;
mindset or priorities of the consumer. In many parts of the world, including India, there is an&#13;
historic focus on first cost rather than life-cycle cost when developing new plants. In making&#13;
equipment purchase decisions, many end-users seek to minimize initial capital costs and pay less&#13;
attention to lifetime operating costs:&#13;
(a)   thus an investment that would improve energy efficiency, but which would cost&#13;
more than a viable alternative investment is less likely to be selected;&#13;
(b)   as a result of this focus on first cost, the installed base of equipment in Orissa&#13;
appears relatively inefficient when compared with North American or European&#13;
standards;&#13;
(c)   the awareness of energy efficiency as a management issue in business is very&#13;
limited to non-existent. Among the more informed consumers there is a tendency&#13;
to focus only on measures with a simple pay-back of one to two years&#13;
(corresponding to IRR of 50-100% ). As a result, many efficiency measures that&#13;
have a longer, still economically attractive, pay-back are not selected;&#13;
(d)   the awareness of energy efficient technologies or O&amp;M practices at the working&#13;
level appears to be very limited in both plants and business as well as in the&#13;
domestic and agricultural sector; and&#13;
(e)   first-cost minimization often occurs in practice because equipment purchase&#13;
decisions are made by people who do not pay, or are not responsible for paying the&#13;
electricity bills. For example managers of operating departments in some industrial&#13;
facilities may choose equipment for their departments, but generally are not aware&#13;
of the effect on electricity consumption since the electricity bill is typically for the&#13;
entire plant and consumption is not traceable to individual operating departments.&#13;
Equipment purchasers who do not pay operating costs have little incentive to&#13;
consider efficiency improvements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 4 of 12&#13;
7.    Infrastructure Barriers. Another element that is necessary for the successful operation of&#13;
DSM programs is an infrastructure in the economy that can deliver, sell and install efficient&#13;
technologies as well as the standard ones:&#13;
(a)    while there are a number of consulting firms in Orissa, only one (Orissa Industrial&#13;
and Technical Consultancy Organization Ltd.) appears to have had a focus on&#13;
energy efficient audits, and they only perform a few efficiency studies per year; and&#13;
(b)    some efficiency technologies are not available in Orissa. For example, electronic&#13;
ballasts are only recently coming on the market, and have a poor reputation due to&#13;
reliability problems. Other technologies such as variable speed drives in motors,&#13;
vapor absorption systems and compact fluorescent lamps are not readily available.&#13;
Approaches to Address Barriers&#13;
8.    Utility Induced Barriers. As part of the Project, a number of steps are being taken to&#13;
address barriers to DSM:&#13;
(a)   tariffs are in the process of being restructured. The intent is to move the trailing&#13;
step of the tariffs towards marginal cost and to contain the imbalance of cost&#13;
recovery between sectors. DSM objectives will be best accomplished in sectors&#13;
which are paying the highest rates. These are the three industrial groups and&#13;
public water works. Conversely, the price signals are weakest in the domestic and&#13;
agricultural sectors, which will make it more difficult to achieve results in these&#13;
sectors. For domestic sector, the increasing block rate structure, with rates at high&#13;
consumption levels reaching, even exceeding cost of supply, will be used to&#13;
provide the correct price signals;&#13;
(b)    Time of Day tariffs are under development, and are expected to be introduced in&#13;
1996. They can not be implemented faster than this, as special meters will have to&#13;
be installed; these are being procured under the Project;&#13;
(c)    an Interruptible Time of Day rate to encourage the use of customer installed&#13;
backup equipment over peak periods has been suggested and taken to the Tariff&#13;
Working Group for further consideration;&#13;
(d)    OSEB is currently tendering for new meters to replace the current defective ones.&#13;
Operational meters will significantly reduce the occurrence of flat rate billing.&#13;
Finally, the proposed privatization of the distribution system, with it's associated&#13;
profit motivation and cost discipline, is expected to help reduce losses further,&#13;
commercial losses in particular, and further improve the billing and collection&#13;
practices. Again, it will take time for these changes to occur;&#13;
(e)    as part of the reform program, investments in generation, transmission and&#13;
distribution are being defined which, when implemented, will allow the system to&#13;
operate in a more reliable, stable manner. However, it will take several years&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 5 of 12&#13;
before the system operates at a level of reliability even close to the levels of&#13;
developed country systems. In the interim period, conservation programs will have&#13;
to avoid the use of technologies that function only is such high-quality supply&#13;
environments and will not withstand voltage and frequency variations;&#13;
(f)    end-use appliance or equipment data has so far not been collected, nor has OSEB&#13;
developed an end-use technology group. However these weakness are recognized&#13;
and the load management/conservation program addresses them. One component&#13;
of this project is to collect such data and develop detailed conservation potential&#13;
estimates and help target conservation programs; and&#13;
(g)   a fundamental starting point in the design and development of a DSM program&#13;
involves the establishment of a load research capacity in OSEB. DSM programs&#13;
have traditionally utilized information that identified the potential for load&#13;
reduction or load shape changes. Developing a DSM program involves identifying&#13;
system demand and power supply (load shape) objectives, analyzing various&#13;
customer programs to meet these objectives, designing a strategy for program&#13;
implementation and assessing results.&#13;
9.    Cultural Barriers. The historic focus on low first cost in plant engineering will take time to&#13;
overcome. It will be necessary for the utility to establish linkages with plant owners at the&#13;
development stage, to promote the concept of life cycle costs, and to alert management about future&#13;
rates. Senior utility staff, active or recently retired, may be particularly effective in this role. It will&#13;
also be necessary to raise management awareness to the benefits of more efficient electricity use. This&#13;
can be done both by raising general awareness through standard marketing approaches, and by using&#13;
the results of case studies or demonstration projects in similar industries to illustrate the benefits. It&#13;
will also be necessary to build awareness at the plant level. To do so will require both general&#13;
awareness building within the business community (similar to above), and a significant amount of&#13;
technical training. The technical assistance program is designed to help initiate such programs.&#13;
10.   Infrastructure Barriers. It will be necessary to help the consulting community in Orissa&#13;
develop the skills and expertise to market energy efficiency projects. This requires two elements.&#13;
First, there must be sufficient business available to encourage existing firms to expand or to attract&#13;
new entrants. Then it is necessary to provide both training and experience to allow these firms to&#13;
become successful. The ultimate goal is to develop the consulting community to the point that it can&#13;
market audits because this is a profitable business, and not as a result of outside support or subsidies.&#13;
11.   Once enough data has been collected to determine which technologies are required in&#13;
Orissa to support the DSM programs, it may be necessary to work with manufacturers and&#13;
distributors to make these products available. Often this is not difficult if there are programs to&#13;
support an adequate level of sales. Also, it may be possible to work with the distribution&#13;
organizations to jointly develop plans to promote these products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 6 of 12&#13;
Sector Priorities for Demand-Side Management&#13;
12.   There are three basic requirements for a successful DSM program: (a) there must be a&#13;
customer with an end-use or application that can be made more efficient; (b) the necessary&#13;
efficiency products must be available; and (c) the customer must have a motivation (usually&#13;
financial) to make the changes. The following table presents the results of the initial potential&#13;
review and prioritizes the areas of opportunity.&#13;
Consumer Sector    Reduction    Project       Technology   Customer&#13;
Potential                 Available?    Motivation&#13;

13.   As indicated in the above table, the customer categories with the highest customer&#13;
motivation are Water Pumping and the Industrial sectors. This is the first place to launch the&#13;
program. If Public lighting retrofits are cost effective to the customer, this may be an easy market&#13;
to address, as there may be relatively few customers. However, in sectors such as the Domestic&#13;
and Irrigation, the benefit to the customer and hence the probability of success is low until tariff,&#13;
billing, collection and other commercial loss problems are addressed. Similarly, the use of back-&#13;
up generation to reduce peak load cannot be addressed until the necessary rates and meters are&#13;
installed.&#13;
Strategy to Initiate DSM in Orissa&#13;
14.   The DSM development strategy in Orissa consists of the three broad components: (a)&#13;
tariff restructuring including time-of-day tariffs; (b) systems and technology applications, and (c)&#13;
institutional and capacity building in DSM and load research. Given the current environment in&#13;
Orissa, the strategy to be applied to launch the DSM program will:&#13;
(a)   assist the utility to build the internal structures and mechanisms necessary to&#13;
implement the program and to administer its funding; build on early successes.&#13;
The implementation of demonstration projects, where the utility has a high degree&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 7 of 12&#13;
of control, will provide both a vehicle for training and case studies to demonstrate&#13;
the value of conservation efforts;&#13;
(b)   initial efforts will be focused on areas where there is the greatest likelihood of&#13;
success. In Orissa, these areas appear to be the industrial sector and the municipal&#13;
water pumping sector. However it is possible to run demonstration projects in&#13;
other sectors;&#13;
(c)   expand the delivery capability with training and other facilitation to prepare&#13;
GRIDCO for ongoing programs;&#13;
(d)   build the necessary end-use and market databases and models to allow orderly&#13;
development of follow-up conservation programs;&#13;
(e)    develop awareness programs and training to prepare the market (end-users) for&#13;
ongoing programs;&#13;
(f)    based on the successes in the demonstration programs, and information acquired&#13;
on end uses, develop pilot programs, and then on-going programs; and&#13;
(g)   extend the DSM program to other sectors, such as domestic and irrigation as the&#13;
economnic signals are corrected.&#13;
Work Already Undertaken/Currently Underway&#13;
15.   A series of approximately 10 preliminary audits in various industries across Orissa are&#13;
being conducted. These will provide additional detail on the potential associated with individual&#13;
sites, and include information on the current installed equipment, potential replacement&#13;
equipment, costs and savings. It is anticipated that these audits will form the basis for the&#13;
industrial demonstration projects, though other projects will also be considered. Demonstration&#13;
projects for the domestic, irrigation and commercial sectors have not yet been identified, and will&#13;
be the responsibility of the technical assistance. Additional related studies currently being carried&#13;
in Orissa include:&#13;
(a)   investigation of load research activities and capability. This was conducted by a an&#13;
international consultant engaged by the Bank, to help formulate the load research&#13;
program;&#13;
(b)   an engineering study on municipal water pumping. A local group is preparing this&#13;
study. An investment of about US$ 2 million is likely to be involved;&#13;
(c)   rewinding of motors. Current motor rewinding practices appear to reduce the&#13;
efficiency of electric motors, as well as shorten their life. A consultant has been&#13;
engaged to do a quantitative assessment in Uttar Pradesh and Orissa; furthermore,&#13;
a parallel study on a motor program to replace inefficient motors by efficient ones&#13;
has been launched;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 8 of 12&#13;
(d)   in-plant load management. A scope of work has been defined, but the project has&#13;
not yet been initiated; however a similar study has been initiated in Uttar Pradesh&#13;
and its findings are likely to be of value to Orissa industrial plants;&#13;
(e)   other DSM investment opportunities at an early stage of preparation include: (1)&#13;
static VAR compensation in industries; (2) industrial cogeneration in sugar,&#13;
chemicals and metallurgical units; and (3) vapor absorption refrigeration in hotels&#13;
and commercial offices; and&#13;
(f)    ODA is in the process of launching an "Industrial Energy Efficiency Project" in&#13;
Orissa. This project will encourage overall energy efficiency, not solely electricity,&#13;
and will be focused on medium sized industry. It consists of developing a series of&#13;
demonstration projects and will be managed by the Bhubaneswar chapter of the&#13;
Confederation of Indian Industries (CII).&#13;
16.   The underlying objective is to develop an ongoing DSM function in Orissa which will&#13;
continue to function after the completion of the Bank-financed project. This will be accomplished&#13;
by:&#13;
(a)   developing an organizational and financial framework that will support ongoing&#13;
DSM. This includes working with GRIDCO to establish a management structure&#13;
to develop and operate the DSM programs, to administer the Bank loan, to define&#13;
an ongoing funding mechanism for DSM, and to review the final plan with the&#13;
GOO;&#13;
(b)   working with GRIDCO to develop a conservation management framework and&#13;
providing sufficient skills transfer such that they can effectively scope, design,&#13;
operate, monitor and evaluate programs,&#13;
(c)   implementing a series of demonstration programs across the major sectors, and in&#13;
different geographic areas, to demonstrate the effectiveness of DSM and to&#13;
prepare case studies which can be used to encourage further conservation projects.&#13;
Funding for installation of these demonstration projects will be available from the&#13;
Bank loan or from local financial institutions;&#13;
(d)   providing training to GRIDCO staff and Orissa consultants and customers;&#13;
(e)   organizing the collection of sufficient end use and market data to allow the orderly&#13;
development of DSM initiatives. Assist the GRIDCO with the development of a&#13;
conservation potential study; and&#13;
(f)   assisting GRIDCO with the development and operation of a program to raise&#13;
awareness of electricity efficiency.&#13;
&#13;

17.   Technical assistance will be provided to help GRIDCO implement the program. As one of&#13;
the major outcomes expected from this program is skills transfer to local staff, as much work as&#13;
possible is to be performed by GRIDCO staff and local consultants. The consulting team will&#13;
have a training orientation in performing all tasks in addition to meeting all deliverables:&#13;
(a)   the consultant will work with GRIDCO to develop the Program Management&#13;
Framework;&#13;
(b)   primary responsibility for initiating the demonstration projects rests with the&#13;
consultant. However field work will be largely done by GRIDCO staff, assisted by&#13;
the consultant. Technical studies will be conducted by local consultants, with&#13;
technical assistance provided by the consultant as required;&#13;
(c)   primary responsibility for the training should reside with the GRIDCO, with&#13;
guidance from the consultant. Material may be presented by the consultant, but&#13;
preference should be given to using Orissa or Indian consultants when possible.&#13;
(d)   primary responsibility for demand side data collection and the conservation&#13;
potential study should reside with the GRIDCO staff and local consultants, under&#13;
guidance from the consultant;&#13;
(e)   primary responsibility for the follow-up program development should reside with&#13;
the GRIDCO, under guidance from the consultant.&#13;
(f)   primary responsibility for the awareness program will be with GRIDCO, under&#13;
guidance from the consultant.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
ORISSA POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
Environmental Impact Summary&#13;
1.    Environmental Impact of the Reform Program. The overall environmental impact of the&#13;
reform program is expected to be significantly positive. Higher electricity tariffs and improved&#13;
metering and collection will encourage electricity conservation. Orissa's existing thermal&#13;
generation will be renovated and new capacity will be constructed and operated by private utilities&#13;
in accordance with modem practices and applicable national environmental standards, which are&#13;
in line with Bank standards. The two major ongoing projects in Orissa are being developed in&#13;
accordance with the Bank Group environmental standards: NTPC's Talcher is supported by the&#13;
Bank under an earlier operation and lb units 3-4 by EFC (approved in July 1994). Transmission&#13;
and distribution rehabilitation, demand-side management (DSM) and technical assistance under&#13;
the proposed Project will significantly reduce power system losses and help improve the efficiency&#13;
of electricity consumption, thereby also contribute to containing environmental emissions.&#13;
2.    The two main investment components to be financed under the proposed Bank loan, Part&#13;
A: Transmission and Distribution and Part B: Demand-Side Management (DSM) are discussed&#13;
below. They account for US$340 million or about 97 percent of the total loan amount. The&#13;
balance of the loan, US$10 million, is allocated to Part C: Institutional Development, Technical&#13;
Assistance and Training.&#13;
Part A: Transmission And Distribution&#13;
Introduction&#13;
3.    Three transmission line projects have been reviewed and will be included in the first phase&#13;
of the loan. Additional projects will be submitted during Project implementation. The&#13;
environmental issues related to these transmission and distribution projects in general and to the&#13;
three selected projects individually are discussed below. Environmental analyses will be submitted&#13;
for all subsequent projects as they are prepared, in line with agreed appraisal criteria (Annex 4.4).&#13;
Environmental Assessment and Clearance Process&#13;
Forest Clearance:&#13;
4.    Under the 1980 Conservation of Forest Act, approval for new lines must be obtained from&#13;
the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MOEF) regional office. Power line routing in India&#13;
undergoes extensive review in the project planning stage. Orissa State Electricity Board (OSEB)&#13;
and under the Project its successor, the Grid Corporation of Orissa (GRIDCO) must demonstrate&#13;
that the power line routing involves a minimum of forest land with alternative route surveys. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.3&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
alternative routes are surveyed jointly by GRIDCO engineers and the Orissa government's&#13;
Department of Forest (DOF) personnel. During the application review and approval process the&#13;
review agencies comment on the application, and can return it to GRIDCO for required&#13;
modifications. MOEF Clearance is not required if the joint line survey concludes that no forest&#13;
land is involved; in this case DOF will issue a letter to this effect. In case forest land is involved,&#13;
the application undergoes the following stages of review:&#13;
(a)   GRIDCO submits the application to the Divisional Forest Officer;&#13;
(b)   Divisional Forest Officer, after review and clearance, submits the application to the&#13;
Conservator of Forest;&#13;
(c)   Conservator of Forest, after review and clearance, submits the application to the&#13;
Principal Chief Conservator of Forest;&#13;
(d)   Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, after review and clearance, submits the&#13;
application to the Forest Department, Government of Orissa;&#13;
(e)   Principal Secretary, Forest Department, Government of Orissa, after review and&#13;
clearance, submits the application to the MOEF Inspector General. The Advisory&#13;
Committee of the Forest Department reviews the application and calls in the&#13;
beneficiaries, GRIDCO and the State Forest Officer, to discuss the proposal; and&#13;
(f)   approval comes to the Principal Secretary, Forest Department of Orissa. The&#13;
approval will contain details of any compensatory forest land approved by the&#13;
Revenue and Forest Departments. The land for compensatory afforestation is&#13;
provided by the state government; in addition, an assessment is made on a per acre&#13;
basis for compensatory afforestation activities.&#13;
Land Acquisition:&#13;
5.    Under the Indian Telegraph Act, transmission towers can be erected on private land;&#13;
however, compensation must be paid. The ownership of the land is not acquired by the&#13;
transmission company.&#13;

Assessment Of Three Transmission Projects For Inclusion In The Project&#13;
Project descriptions&#13;
6.    The following three transmission projects will be included in the first phase of the loan.&#13;
220 kV DC Brajarajnagar - Bolangir:&#13;
7.    The construction activities include:&#13;
(a)   construction of a 220 kV DC line (170 km) from Brajrajnagar to Bolangir;&#13;
(b)   establishment of a 220/132 kV I x 100 MVA substation at Bolangir;&#13;
(c)   extension of two 220 kV feeder bays at Brajrajnagar; and&#13;
(d)   establishment of a PLCC network for the above.&#13;
220 kVDC Meramundali - Bidanasi:&#13;
8.    The construction activities include:&#13;
(a)   construction of 220 kV DC line (105 km) from Meramundali to Chandaka;&#13;
(b)   establishment of a 220/132 kV 2 x 100 MVA substation at Cuttack;&#13;
(c)   extension of feeder bays at Meramundali and Chandaka; and&#13;
(d)   establishment of a PLCC network for the above.&#13;
220 kV DC Duburi - Paradeep:&#13;
9.    The construction activities include:&#13;
(a)   construction of 220 kV DC line (100 km) from Duburi to Paradeep;&#13;
(b)   establishment of a 220/132 kV 2 x 100 MVA substation at Paradeep;&#13;
(c)   extension of two 220 kV feeder bays at Duburi;&#13;
(d)   inter-linking 220 kV Paradeep substation with Paradeep existing 132 kV&#13;
substation, (8 km of 132 kV DC line); and&#13;
(e)   establishment of a PLCC network for the above.&#13;

Environmental issues and mitigation strategies&#13;
10.   The issues below have been addressed during the conceptual design.&#13;
Resettlement and rehabilitation:&#13;
11.   There will be no resettlement involved in the above projects.&#13;
Transmission line rights of way and substation site impacts on land use: agricultural and&#13;
forest areas, wetlands, wildiands:&#13;
12.   The 220 kV DC Duburi - Paradeep and the 220 kV DC Meramundali - Bidanasi&#13;
transmission lines do not cross forest land.. The 220 kV DC Brajarajnagar - Bolangir transmission&#13;
line involves 5 ha of forest land. With such a small amount of forest land involved, habitat&#13;
fragmentation and invasion of exotic vegetation species would not be an issue. Transmission line&#13;
towers will not impact agricultural land uses since the transmission company does not acquire&#13;
ownership of the rights of way. There are no wildlands involved in the transmission line routes.&#13;
Access roads in remote areas, increase in hunting, exploitation of forest resources, induced&#13;
development due to new access corridors, human settlement and more extensive clearing:&#13;
13.   With only 5 ha of forest land involved in one of the projects, these issues are not of&#13;
concern. Existing forest roads are used by GRIDCO for access, no new roads are built for this&#13;
purpose.&#13;
Clearing (erosion, loss of habitat) and control of vegetation in rights of ways, including&#13;
mechanical and chemical (herbicide) clearing operations, (chemical contamination of site&#13;
and rainfall runoff):&#13;
14.   After the power lines are strung on the towers, the forest department re-vegetates the&#13;
areas that have been cleared for construction. Chemical herbicides are not used in right-of-way&#13;
clearance.&#13;
Erosion during construction, and along access roads, substation and transmission tower&#13;
sites:&#13;
15.   GRIDCO will undertake a monitoring program of construction activities, steps will be&#13;
taken to control these impacts during construction. Maintenance of the new infrastructure will&#13;
include erosion control at the transmission tower bases (especially in hilly terrain) and substation&#13;
pads.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.3&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
Potential electromagnetic frequency (EMF) radiation effects, radio noise and television&#13;
interference, and audible noise along transmission line routes, exposure of substation&#13;
operations personnel to potential EMF hazards:&#13;
16.   Government of India regulations (Indian Electricity Rules, 1956) on minimum&#13;
transmission line clearance distances to address safety and EMF effects are applied by GRIDCO.&#13;
The Rules specify minimum horizontal and vertical distances between power lines, roads and&#13;
structures, and cover proximity to airports.&#13;
Public access to substations, towers and electrocution hazards, proximity to airports:&#13;
17.   GRIDCO will effect restriction of public access, by fencing and security of substations and&#13;
towers (required under Indian Electricity Rules). A consumer safety program is included in the&#13;
ODA technical assistance. The Indian Electricity Rules cover safety with regard to transporting&#13;
and storing materials near overhead lines, accessibility of bare conductors, danger notices,&#13;
provisions applicable to protective equipment, precautions to be adopted by consumers, owners,&#13;
electrical contractors, electrical workmen and suppliers, and inspections. The Indian Electricity&#13;
Rules also address safety and protective devices, such as distance relays and ground fault&#13;
protection.&#13;
Alternatves&#13;
18.   Alternatives selected by OSEB were based on criteria of energy conservation through&#13;
improved efficiency of the transmission system, that is, reduction of system losses and increased&#13;
reliability of the system. DSM will be addressed under the Project. Routes and substation sites&#13;
are selected for minimum impact on forest resources (a statutory requirement), and minimal&#13;
impact on crowded urban areas, (substation placement in Cuttack rather than Bhubaneswar for&#13;
instance). The transmission schemes chosen are double-circuit (DC) lines to minimize rights of&#13;
way requirements.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
19.   A technical assistance component of the project will be provided, under an ODA grant, to&#13;
help implement Part A of the proposed project (Annex 4.3). It is to begin in mid-1996 and extend&#13;
for a period of about five years. Under this technical assistance the environmental management&#13;
capabilities of the Grid Corporation of Orissa (GRIDCO) will also be developed. Activities of&#13;
the ODA technical assistance include:&#13;
(a)   development of an organization and staffing plan for the environmental&#13;
management unit (based on comparisons with similar utilities on an international&#13;
basis, as well as industrial organizations operating within the environmental&#13;
performance standards of the Government of India);&#13;
(b)   development of a corporate environmental policy for GRIDCO;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.3&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
(c)   development of systems to enable GRIDCO to meet the requirements of relevant&#13;
Indian (and where appropriate international) environmental standards in a cost&#13;
effective and efficient way;&#13;
(d)   development of systems to ensure that actions recommended by the environmental&#13;
management unit are acted upon by corporate management in GRIDCO, and&#13;
define methods to evaluate and monitor performance with respect to project&#13;
implementation;&#13;
(e)   ensure that contractual obligations or other measures are put into to comply with&#13;
GRIDCO's environmental policies;&#13;
(f)    develop capabilities with respect to environmental auditing;&#13;
(g)   a coordinated in-country training program for staff of the environmental&#13;
management unit of GRIDCO,&#13;
(h)   undertake a study tour to assess environmental management systems associated&#13;
with U}K transmission and distribution systems;&#13;
(i)   support GRIDCO's planning capability for new transmission systems by developing&#13;
environmental assessment (EA) procedures and establishing criteria for evaluating&#13;
direct and indirect environmental and social impacts associated with new&#13;
development proposals; and&#13;
(j)   undertake EAs of selected routes and standardize approaches adopted on issues&#13;
such as land severance.&#13;
Management of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB's)&#13;
20.          Prior to initiation of power distribution system rehabilitation under the Project,&#13;
when electrical equipment will be replaced, technical assistance will be provided to GRIDCO for&#13;
the environmentally sound management of PCB electrical equipment. The technical assistance will&#13;
cover as required based on the initial assessment, the management and cleanup of transformer&#13;
installations, discarded equipment, and the repair shop.&#13;
21.          Various components of the existing power systems are up to 30 years old, and&#13;
since the use of PCB's in electrical equipment was discontinued (in most countries) fairly recently,&#13;
some of the existing power system electrical equipment may contain PCB's. Based on Orissa's&#13;
own assessment in 1995, PCBs are not expected to be a major issue. The technical assistance will&#13;
nevertheless address the following:&#13;
(a)   development of environmental guidelines which review GOI (or international)&#13;
regulations concerning the use, retrofitting, storage and disposal practices for&#13;
PCB's and PCB electrical equipment;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.3&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
(b)   environmental guidelines should state which of the existing system electrical&#13;
equipment would be replaced, and if any of this equipment has been tested for&#13;
PCBs;&#13;
(c)   the environmental guidelines should detail how PCB electrical equipment and&#13;
PCB's would be tested or otherwise identified; and&#13;
(d)   the environmental guidelines should detail an environmentally sound PCB&#13;
management plan for safe storage and/or disposal of PCB electrical equipment.&#13;
The PCB management plan should include specifications for safe handling&#13;
practices, including personnel protective equipment and clothing, and the&#13;
environmental guidelines should provide details of safe transfer and secure storage&#13;
areas.&#13;
Monitoring&#13;
22.         The following monitoring plan will be adopted as a policy of GRIDCO to track the&#13;
effectiveness of mitigation techniques, and address recognized problems in an appropriate and&#13;
timely manner. Development of a system for bringing environmental problems to the attention of&#13;
management is included in the ODA technical assistance. Some of the items listed under the&#13;
following monitoring program do not relate to the three projects proposed; however, these issues&#13;
may relate to other GRIDCO transmission lines. This regular scheduled monitoring program will&#13;
consist chiefly of visual inspections during construction and operation for:&#13;
(a)   erosion along access roads, substation and transmission tower foundations;&#13;
(b)   encroachment of settlements within rights of ways, encroachment of settlements&#13;
within protected areas via transmission line access roads, exploitation of forest&#13;
resources in protected areas via access roads;&#13;
(c)   vegetation clearances below transmission lines, and invasion of exotic species&#13;
along right of ways;&#13;
(d)   transformer fluid leakage and spills; and&#13;
(e)   safe storage and disposal of PCBs.&#13;
Part B: Demand-Side Management (DSM)&#13;
23.   The overall environmental impact of the reform program is expected to be significantly&#13;
positive. Higher electricity tariffs and improved metering and collection will encourage electricity&#13;
conservation. Based on the work of the Metering Working Group of the Reform Implementation&#13;
Organization, about 2/3 of OSEB's meters are not working properly or are not functioning at all.&#13;
Part B will help GRIDCO purchase and install reliable meters to replace them. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.3&#13;
Page 8 of 8&#13;
implementation (physical installation) involves no impact on the environment. Once installed and&#13;
operational, the meters will facilitate accurate metering and on that basis correct billing of&#13;
consumers. Along with the increases in electricity rates introduced since 1992 and continuing&#13;
program of tariff adjustments, this will send the right price signals to consumers (for the first time&#13;
for most of them) and is expected to help contain the growth of electricity demand in Orissa. This&#13;
in turn will result in lower emissions from the generation plants that are operated to meet the&#13;
demand and help defer some of the new generation projects.&#13;
24.   The balance of Part B is for load research and direct measures to manage load and&#13;
conserve electricity. The load research program will help GRIDCO better understand how its&#13;
consumers use electricity. This will help in design of more effective tariff structures, which are&#13;
more responsive to the needs of the consumers and load management/conservation potential.&#13;
25.   Part B will also support a pilot program of other DSM investments. A comprehensive&#13;
technical assistance program will be implemented to help GRIDCO and electricity end-users&#13;
design and implement actual measures. Details are given in Annex 3.2.&#13;

INSTITUTION BUILDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
OF INSTITUTION BUILDING CONSULTANTS&#13;
Background&#13;
I . The Government of Orissa (GOO) has committed itself to reform the power sector in&#13;
Orissa. GOO has decided to vertically disintegrate and unbundle the sector by creating the Orissa&#13;
Hydro Power Corporation (OHPC) and other generating companies, the Grid Corporation of&#13;
Orissa (GRIDCO), and establishing an independent regulator for regulating the various entities.&#13;
GOO's ultimate objective is to withdraw from the sector as a utility operator and to have private&#13;
sector utility organizations operating in a market regulated by an independent regulator. To&#13;
succeed in the commercialization and eventual privatization, OSEB's successor organizations&#13;
need to change the existing culture and approach to management. GRIDCO and OHPC need to&#13;
be result and customer oriented viable entities and therefore need to develop an appropriate&#13;
organizational structure, systems, and business processes, embodying the principles of managerial&#13;
autonomy, delegation and accountability. GOO has commenced a program to achieve these goals.&#13;
To assist GOO in carrying out an ambitious program of restructuring and assist new entities in&#13;
institutional development, the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) has provided a grant&#13;
of about US $ 18 million, which inter-alia covers phase 2 of the Reform Consultant's work as well&#13;

INDIA&#13;
ORISSA POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR&#13;
THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT UNIT&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Orissa power sector is undergoing fundamental restructuring with the separation of&#13;
generation from transmission and distribution and the creation of a new corporation, the Grid&#13;
Corporation of Orissa (GRIDCO). It is the aim of GRIDCO to privatize distribution by 2000.&#13;
Four zones have been created, one of these is now being operated under a management contract&#13;
leading later to a long lease or full privatisation. The other three zones will receive similar&#13;
treatment during the period of the project.&#13;
2.    GRIDCO operates about seven thousand km of 132 kV, 220 kV and 400 kV lines.&#13;
Transformer capacity from Transmission to Distribution is about 5,500 MVA. The distribution&#13;
system is operated at 33 kV, 11 kV and 400 V. There are about 10,000 route km of 33 kV lines,&#13;
50,000 km of 11 kV lines, 700 of 33/11 kV substations and 30,000 of 11/0.4 kV substations.&#13;
3.    GRIDCO will inherit from the Orissa State Electricity Board (OSEB) a run down system&#13;
starved of investment and maintenance for many years. With the assistance of the Bank, ADB&#13;
and ODA, GRIDCO proposes to undertake a major investment program within the fiscal 1997 -&#13;
2003 period to overcome these deficiencies and to ensure that the increased generation capacity&#13;
can be transmitted and distributed to the end users with acceptable technical losses.&#13;
4.    To achieve this goal, GRIDCO has established a Project Management Unit (PMU). The&#13;
capacity of the organization inherited by GRIDCO is insufficient to undertake such a major&#13;
investment program. GRIDCO therefore requires substantial external assistance in the&#13;
establishment of the PMU and in the initial years of the investment program.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
5.    The objectives of this consultancy are:&#13;
(a)   to ensure that the project and sub-projects are implemented on time, within budget&#13;
and to the specified quality; and&#13;
(b)   to build the capacity of GRIDCO, and its successor entities in the distribution&#13;
zones, to plan and implement future major investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.3&#13;
Page 2 of 11&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
General&#13;
6.    These terms of reference are for consulting services to establish and lead a Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMU) within GRIDCO to manage power system projects for transmission&#13;
lines, substations, distribution systems and other related activities. The PMU will comprise&#13;
GRIDCO staff supported by the UK Consultants in consortium with approved National&#13;
consultants. The assignment is financed by ODA.&#13;
7.    The PMU will manage the execution of the work including;&#13;
+ preparation of Project Reports in a manner acceptable to financial institutions&#13;
including the Bank, ADB, ODA, PFC;&#13;
* preparation of contract packages;&#13;
* preparation of preliminary designs;&#13;
* review and revision of existing specifications and contract documents;&#13;
+ bid evaluation; and&#13;
* supervision during construction.&#13;
8.    The PMU will also carry out studies to determine the overall environmental impact of the&#13;
projects in accordance with Bank guidelines. The general scope of work is as set out below.&#13;
Project Definition Report&#13;
9.    The first task of the PMU will be the review and refinement of the overall scope of the&#13;
project, prepared by MONENCO AGRA under ADB funded Technical Assistance, and its&#13;
components within the framework defined herein. The findings will be summarized in the Project&#13;
Definition Report which will form the basis for the execution of the work.&#13;
10.   The Project Definition Report will define the scope of the project within the constraints of&#13;
the investments available and the requirements of GRIDCO. The Project Definition Report will&#13;

31.   The general scope of the PMU's work in relation to the above should give priority to&#13;
reduction of technical losses. Projects requiring technical improvements resulting from the&#13;
program to reduce non-technical losses will be included in the scope of the PMU.&#13;
Project Management Training&#13;
32.   The Consultant's staff will work closely with the staff of GRIDCO in the PMU to ensure&#13;
an adequate transfer of technology. It is the intent that, upon completion of these projects,&#13;
GRIDCO will retain the capability to manage future projects without the use of outside&#13;
consultants.&#13;
33.   To achieve this, the Consultant will involve GRIDCO in the development of all procedures&#13;
for project control to typically include planning and reporting procedures, cost control, work&#13;
measurement and definition of the data for computerized project management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.3&#13;
Page 8 of 1I&#13;
Environmental Management and Assessment&#13;
34.   GRIDCO and the funding agencies place high priority on environmental issues. The PMU&#13;
will specifically develop environmental management skills of GRIDCO. The consultants shall&#13;
assist in developing a corporate environmental policy for transmission and distribution projects&#13;
and develop systems to ensure that this policy is acted upon by GRIDCO, its suppliers and&#13;
distributors and define methods to evaluate and monitor performance with respect to project&#13;
implementation. Additional details of the environmental issues and the technical assistance to be&#13;
included in the assignment are given in Annex 3.5.&#13;
35.   The PMU will prepare an environmental impact assessment of the whole project in which&#13;
it will define the effects in relation to base line data which, if not available in published form, will&#13;
be established. The impact statement will conform to Annex 3.5 guidelines for defining the effects&#13;
of the project(s) and will be carried out as one of the initial tasks to be performed and included in&#13;
the project definition document. The objective of this assessments includes a review of the&#13;
assessment undertaken during the preparation of the Bank loan to finance the program and&#13;
incorporate the findings into the work program in individual transmission lines, substations and&#13;
distribution sub-projects. Each project report will include a section documenting, reviewing and&#13;
refining if necessary the relevant sections of the overall environmental assessment.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
Establishment of PMU&#13;
36.   To execute the project within the time frame envisaged will call for fundamental changes&#13;
in existing procedures and practices inherited by GRIDCO which have been developed over many&#13;
years and were institutionalized in the former OSEB. Under an ongoing consultancy, GRIDCO is&#13;
receiving technical assistance in an Institutional Strengthening Project (ISP). As part of the ISP, a&#13;
new organization has been developed, a copy of the latest organization chart is attached. It is&#13;
currently anticipated that he PMU will be set up under the Director Corporate Planning and that&#13;
two teams will be established, one under the Corporate Chief Engineer and the other under&#13;
Director Distribution. The final organization of the PMU will be discussed and resolved to the&#13;
satisfaction of the Bank, ADB and ODA during the inception phase of the assignment. The PMU&#13;
will have the necessary authority and facility to streamline the activities.&#13;
37.   Assuming the above organization, the consultant's team leader will act as an expert&#13;
supporting the Director Corporate Planning &amp; Divestiture. Under the team leader there will be&#13;
two teams of specialists, one assigned to the Corporate Chief Engineer for transmission and&#13;
substation activities and the other to the Technical Manager Distribution. Specialists will be&#13;
provided in each group to support all aspects of the PMU activities. The specialists will not have&#13;
executive authority, this will be exercised by GRIDCO staff. However, Specialists shall be full&#13;
members of tender committees which decide on award of tenders.&#13;
38.   The consultants will be expected to be involved in establishing and staffing the Project&#13;
Management Unit to manage power system development projects within GRIDCO. In addition to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.3&#13;
Page 9 of II&#13;
GRIDCO staff and the consultants' personnel, the unit will include engineers and specialists from&#13;
national consultants acceptable to ODA, Bank and GRIDCO. This team will thus provide the&#13;
technical and management expertise and the local knowledge necessary to address and resolve the&#13;
diverse range of issues requiring to be addressed in such a plan. The interrelationship between the&#13;
member organizations which comprise the PMU will be determined during initial discussion&#13;
between the consultants and GRIDCO. The participation of the national consultants will be&#13;
determined based on the expertise and availability of personnel.&#13;
39.   The procurement in bulk of large long delivery items may, if appropriate, be carried out by&#13;
a procurement agent who will perform this function within the PMU under the direction of&#13;
GRIDCO who will enter into a separate contract for this work.&#13;
Project Management System&#13;
40.   The consultant will assist the PMU to develop an integrated infrastructure through which&#13;
to program and execute the development of the power system in the State of Orissa. It will&#13;
introduce the application of modem project management techniques using a well known PC based&#13;
project management system which will be applied to planning scheduling, cost control, document&#13;
control, procurement tracking, and contract progress reporting and certification to the extent&#13;
required and to suit the contract strategy selected.&#13;
41.   To support the application of the Project Management System the consultants will include&#13;
personnel with the appropriate background and expertise including short term specialists to&#13;
establish the procedures and methods for implementation of the system.&#13;
42.   An important component of the project execution will be the development and application&#13;
of effective cost control procedures. To realize this, the consultants' personnel will establish the&#13;
appropriate procedures which, when implemented with the project management system, will&#13;
provide the comprehensive project control required.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
43.   The initial activities to be carried out will be the identification and definition of the scope&#13;
of each of the sub-projects in transmission lines, substations and distribution systems, and&#13;
integrating them into a comprehensive coordinated project. In parallel with this activity will be&#13;
the pre-qualification of large bulk equipment suppliers and turnkey construction contractors.&#13;
Project Phasing&#13;
The strategy to be adopted in the execution of the development projects can be separated into three&#13;
phases. These are described briefly as follows:&#13;
(a)   Phase 1 - Project Definition and Preliminary Design&#13;
(i)   includes definition of the scope of design briefs of each of the individual&#13;
sub-projects, identification and definition of the bulk purchase items to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.3&#13;
Page 10 of II&#13;
procured, review of specifications and procurement documents, solicitation&#13;
of bids, evaluation and award of contract for bulk purchase items, and&#13;
carrying out the environment impact study.&#13;
(b)   Phase 2 - Contract Procurement&#13;
(i)   includes grouping of the sub-projects into contract packages by type of&#13;
work and geographical location, preparation of the contract packages in&#13;
sufficient detail to permit turnkey bids to be; made for their execution,&#13;
evaluation of bids and contract award. This phase will also include the&#13;
installation and training of the Computerized Project Management System.&#13;
(c)   Phase 3 - Contract Monitoring&#13;
(i)   includes monitoring the progress on turnkey contract packages and project&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
Training of GRIDCO staff will be included in all three phases.&#13;
Project Schedule&#13;
44.   The overall project schedule is attached. This indicates the initial tasks of project&#13;
definition, conceptual design and contract packaging and procurement in parallel with the&#13;
environmental assessments and establishment of systems and procedures.&#13;
45.   The schedule is produced in two parts. Part 1 shows the activities in the initial 12 month&#13;
period during which almost all of the engineering, review specifications and contract documents&#13;
are carried out and represents the period of the most intensive activity.&#13;
46.   The second part of the schedule shows the remainder of the construction period from 13&#13;
to 60 months.&#13;
47.   It is expected that the level of support will reduce significantly during and after the third&#13;
year of the project. Staffing levels will be reviewed regularly against the capacity of GRIDCO to&#13;
implement the project.&#13;
48.   The project schedules are shown as a guide and no consideration is given to unknown&#13;
local factors which may influence the various activities.&#13;
Organisation and Staffing&#13;
Organisation&#13;
49.   Project Definition as well as overall planning and control of the Project will be carried out in&#13;
the Corporate Chief Engineer's Department. The implementation of the components of the Project will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.3&#13;
Page 11 of 11&#13;
be undertaken by the Transmission and Distribution Departments as appropriate. PMU consultant&#13;
team leaders and specialists work with GRIDCO staff in the concerned departments.&#13;
Staffing&#13;
50.   To staff the project, the Consultant shall provide a team of professionals with previous&#13;
experience in similar work. The team will include managers, engineers, and contract, cost control&#13;
and scheduling specialists. They will have experience of working within a power utility including&#13;
in developing country&#13;
51.   In view of their experience nationally, GRIDCO would like the consultants to associate&#13;
with POWERGRID in the areas of Procurement and Transmission Lines and Substations. It was&#13;
therefore required that all proposers provide for the involvement of POWERGRID. Staff&#13;
provided by National consultants (including POWERGRID) shall have similar backgrounds to the&#13;
Consultant and bring to the team considerable experience on similar work throughout India.&#13;
52.   Staff to be provided by GRIDCO within the PMU will be defined at the time of contract&#13;
and should include managers, engineers and other project-related disciplines. As a minimum,&#13;
GRIDCO will provide the deputy project manager and counterpart staff in the areas of project&#13;
controls, procurement and construction supervision. These personnel provided by GRIDCO&#13;
should be in sufficient numbers and of skill levels such that, on completion of the project, the&#13;
necessary institutional reinforcement will have taken place to enable GRIDCO to carry out similar&#13;
projects without outside assistance. GRIDCO will provide profiles of the individuals who should&#13;
participate in the project.&#13;

ORISSA POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW PLAN&#13;
1.    Project Management and Progress Reporting. GRIDCO and OHPC, with the help of&#13;
the their consultants, will continue to implement the project. The overall implementation plan of&#13;
the reform program has been developed by the Reform Implementation Organization and the&#13;
Reform Consultant using a computerized project management program. Implementation will be&#13;
monitored by the Government of Orissa - and the financiers including the Bank and ODA.&#13;
Regular meetings will review, monitor and refine the work plans for the preceding, current and&#13;
following two months. Such Project Board Meetings are being held every 6-8 weeks.&#13;
2.    GRIDCO will submit to the Bank quarterly progress reports covering the work of Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMU), procurement, physical progress of project components, disbursements,&#13;
and various administrative and financial aspect of the Project. GRIDCO will be assisted in&#13;
progress reporting by PMU consultants for Part A and by the consultants to be engaged by ODA&#13;
to help implement the DSM component under Part B. OHPC will be similarly assisted by the&#13;
consultants to be engaged by ODA to help implement the environmental management component&#13;
under Part C. GRIDCO and OHPC will also submit to the Bank, quarterly information on&#13;
receivables against supply of power, age-analysis of receivables, commercial payables, cash-flow&#13;
statement, and every six-months ( i.e. at the end of June and December) information on estimated&#13;
rates of return on equity and self financing ratios. The formats for these reports have been&#13;
submitted to the Orissa government. GRIDCO and OHPC will also furnish to the Bank annually&#13;
financial and audit reports.&#13;
3.    Bank Reviews. Implementation review missions will inter alia review the Orissa&#13;
government's progress in the implementation of the reform program and compliance with the&#13;
power sector policy statement covenanted under the Project. In view of the nature of the reform&#13;
program it supports, the Project will require much more than standard Bank supervision time and&#13;
is estimated to require about 40 weeks per year in the first two years, reducing gradually&#13;
thereafter. The Project will be reviewed annually in the first three years at the depth of a regular&#13;
mid-term review.&#13;
4.    A part of the Project's intensive supervision effort will be carried out by two restructuring&#13;
experts and a private power expert, consultants engaged by the Bank to review the original&#13;
reform program in early 1994.&#13;
5.    Review Missions. The following implementation review mission schedule is proposed:&#13;
(a)   FY96 (second hal: Two implementation review missions of Bank staff (Task&#13;
Manager/Institutional/Economics and Finance disciplines, plus participation by&#13;
Environment and R&amp;R, Engineering and DSM in at least one of them). The first&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.5&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
mission was fielded in March 1996. Two visits, one by a restructuring experts and&#13;
one by the private power expert, some of their visits coinciding with the Bank&#13;
missions;&#13;
(b)   FY97 - FY99: Four implementation review missions of Bank staff (Task&#13;
Manager/Institutional/ Economics and/or Finance disciplines, plus participation by&#13;
Environment and R&amp;R, Engineering and DSM disciplines in at least two of them).&#13;
One of the missions will be an annual review equivalent to a normal mid-term&#13;
review. Possibly additional visits by the Bank team's Delhi-based members to&#13;
examine specific urgent issues. Four visits, every three months, by one of the two&#13;
restructuring experts, three visits, once in every four months, by the private power&#13;
expert, some of their visits coinciding with the Bank missions;&#13;
(c)   FY2000-FY2002: three implementation review missions of Bank staff (Task&#13;
Manager/Institutional/Economics and Finance disciplines, plus participation by&#13;
Environment and R&amp;R, Engineering and DSM disciplines in at least two of them).&#13;
Possibly additional visits by the Bank team's Delhi-based members to examine&#13;
specific urgent issues; and&#13;
(d)   FY2003: The Implementation Completion Review.&#13;
6.    ODA Monitoring. It is expected that ODA will co-finance the project and will&#13;
participate in monitoring the implementation of the reform program. This is in continuation of&#13;
ODA's active participation since mid-1994 and close coordination and consultation between the&#13;
Bank and ODA is expected to continue. Some of the regular supervision missions are expected to&#13;
be joint Bank/ODA missions.&#13;
Schedule and Milestones&#13;

INDIA&#13;
ORISSA POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    Economic Viability of Orissa's Investment Program. The analysis focuses on Orissa's&#13;
core investment program which is supported in part by the proposed Bank loan. The economic&#13;
rate of return (ERR) was calculated on the basis of the incremental cost and benefit streams&#13;
associated with the FY1997-2003 time-slice of Orissa's investment program. The time-slice&#13;
period covers the construction and first few years of operation of lb Valley thermal plants (units&#13;
1-4); the Upper Indravati hydro plant; the rehabilitation work on Hirakud hydro plant; the&#13;
expansion and upgrading of the transmission and distribution system; and, the implementation of a&#13;
demand side management (DSM) program.&#13;
2.    Costs. The investment plan is discussed in Annex 2.3, and GRIDCO's is reviewed in&#13;
detail in Annex 3.1. Projects completed during the time-slice period were taken as the time-slice&#13;
investment program. Financial costs of that program were converted to economic terms by&#13;
excluding taxes and duties and by applying a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 to the&#13;
residual local costs. The resulting total time-slice investments are shown in table 1.&#13;
3.    The economic costs of oil products were estimated using the Bank's oil price projections.&#13;
The economic costs of coal used in this analysis correspond to the Bank's estimates for Orissa in&#13;
the 1991 study Long Term Issues in the Power Sector, updated to 1995 prices. Also shown in&#13;
table I are Orissa's other incremental (in excess of 1996, the base year of the analysis) operations&#13;
and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs, taken from OHPC's, OPGC's and GRIDCO's financial projection&#13;
and converted into economic terms by applying the SCF. Table I also includes Orissa's&#13;
incremental power purchases from NTPC, taken from GRIDCO's financial projections. Since&#13;
NTPC's tariffs are in line with its long-run marginal costs (LRMC), reflected in the 14.7% rate of&#13;
return of its investment program (as per SAR of the NTPC Power Generation Project), the SCF&#13;
was not applied to power purchases. Fuel, power purchases and O&amp;M costs of the last year of&#13;
the time-slice investment period were kept constant in real terms through FY2022, the operating&#13;
period of the time-slice investments.&#13;
4.    Benefits. For the purposes of the first round of ERR calculations, GRIDCO's incremental&#13;
tariff revenue was used as a proxy for economic benefits. GRIDCO's tariffs are discussed in&#13;
Annex 2.5. Tariff revenue is regarded to be a minimum measure of the actual benefits as it&#13;
reflects only a portion of the total benefits of electricity supply; yet the ERR of the program is&#13;
satisfactory at about 14.5% with this conservative revenue-based benefit valuation. The&#13;
incremental tariff revenue is shown in table 1.&#13;
5.    Economic Valuation of Benefits. A more accurate valuation of the economic benefits of&#13;
electricity supply was carried out for the second round of ERR calculations to complement the&#13;
revenue-based valuation. The valuation was undertaken in two parts: (a) first, for each consumer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.1&#13;
Page 2 of 12&#13;
category, the fuel substitution and induced consumption shares of the incremental electricity&#13;
supply are estimated, and (b) second, sales replacing the use of alternative energy are valued at&#13;
the economic cost of the alternative energy source, and induced sales are valued by estimating the&#13;
willingness to pay for this incremental consumption for each consumer category.&#13;
6.    Fuel Substitution. The shares of incremental electricity supply assumed to replace an&#13;
alternative energy source in each consumer category are the following: 10% for domestic, 50%&#13;
for commercial and industrial, and 20% for agriculture. The economic benefit of fuel substitution&#13;
is the resulting economic resource cost saving. That is, the economic cost of alternative energy&#13;
which the country saves by using electricity. These benefits are shown in tables 2, 3 and 4.&#13;
7.    Induced Consumption. The shares of incremental electricity supply corresponding to&#13;
induced consumption are: 90% for domestic, 50% for commercial and industrial, and 80% for&#13;
agriculture. Induced consumption was valued by estimating the consumer's willingness to pay for&#13;
this part of incremental electricity supply and adding the related consumer's surplus benefits to the&#13;
tariff-based revenues from above consumer categories. Present excess demand indicates that&#13;
consumers' willingness to pay for public electricity exceeds existing tariffs levels. Willingness to&#13;
pay for the induced consumption is related to the financial costs of the alternative supply. The&#13;
financial costs of the main alternative sources of energy to the different consumer categories&#13;
(diesel generators for industrial and commercial consumers, and diesel pumps for agriculture&#13;
consumers) are shown in tables 5 and 6. This provided the upper limit of the willingness to pay&#13;
and consumer's surplus, defined as the difference of what the consumer would be willing to pay&#13;
(measured here on the basis of what the consumer pays for the alternative sources of energy) and&#13;
what the consumer pays for electricity.&#13;
8.    Given the sensitivity of demand to price for the various categories of consumers, only a&#13;
portion of the maximum consumer's surplus benefits was assumed for the valuation of induced&#13;
sales. For each consumer category, the assumed portion was multiplied by the difference between&#13;
the maximum willingness to pay and the prevailing financial tariff, then shadow priced using the&#13;
SCF of 0.9 and then added to the financial tariff. This yields the total economic benefit of induced&#13;
consumption. The portions (shares) of the maximum consumer's surplus benefits assumed in this&#13;
analysis were the following: (a) the base case scenario assumes 50% (i.e. assumes a linear demand&#13;
curve) for industrial and commercial consumers, and 30% (i.e. assumes a strongly convex demand&#13;
curve) for residential and agriculture consumers; (b) sensitivity analysis 1 assumes more&#13;
conservative estimates of the consumers' willingness to pay, and accordingly, a 30% for industrial&#13;
and commercial consumers and no consumer's surplus (i.e. values benefit of induced consumption&#13;
at tariff) for residential and agriculture consumers; and (c) sensitivity analysis 2 excludes the&#13;
consumer's surplus entirely, and only the prevailing tariff was taken as the economic value of&#13;
induced consumption.&#13;
9.    Industrial Consumers. For industrial consumers it was assumed that in the absence of&#13;
grid supply, there would be substantial generation using diesel generators. Accordingly, it was&#13;
assumed that 50% of the incremental electricity supply would replace diesel generators. This&#13;
additional generation was valued at the economic cost of autogeneration based on 200-400 kW&#13;
diesel generators, assuming a plant utilization factor of 70% since this electricity should be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.1&#13;
Page 3 of 12&#13;
compared with back-up systems running for long periods of time (table 3). (The 70% estimate is&#13;
relatively high, but conservative for the purpose of this analysis, as using a lower plant utilization&#13;
factor would increase the economic resource cost saving and result in higher ERRs). The 50%&#13;
balance of incremental sales was assumed to be induced consumption. In computing the financial&#13;
costs for this supply, a 15% plant utilization factor was assumed, on the basis that the consumers&#13;
current willingness to pay involves back-up systems actually running for short periods of time.&#13;
The base case assumes a linear demand curve, and accordingly, takes a 50% of maximum&#13;
consumer's surplus benefits, based on 200-400 kW diesel generators (table 6). Sensitivity case I&#13;
assumes a strongly convex demand curve (30% of maximum consumer's surplus benefits), and&#13;
sensitivity case 2 assumes no consumer's surplus.&#13;
10.   Commercial Consumers. The assumptions made for industrial consumers are also made&#13;
for commercial consumers. However, it was assumed that commercial consumers would use 50&#13;
kW diesel generators for their autogeneration. Tables 3 and 6 give the corresponding economic&#13;
and financial costs.&#13;
11.   Domestic Consumers. For domestic consumers it was assumed that only 10% of the&#13;
incremental sales would be for the replacement of kerosene. Table 4 gives the corresponding&#13;
economic costs. The balance 90% of additional supply was assumed to be induced consumption,&#13;
and was valued by estimating the willingness to pay for this supply, based conservatively, on 50&#13;
kW diesel generators. Although it would be theoretically more appropriate to compute the&#13;
financial costs of kerosene lighting to estimate the willingness to pay for induced consumption,&#13;
the financial costs of diesel generation were considered more practical since most of the induced&#13;
consumption such as refrigeration and ventilation are not expected to be met with kerosene. Had&#13;
the financial costs been estimated using smaller (1-10 kW) diesel generators or kerosene lighting&#13;
(table 4), the values would be much higher, thus resulting in higher rates of return. The base case&#13;
assumes a consumer's surplus equivalent to 30% of the financial costs of autogeneration.&#13;
Sensitivity cases 1 and 2 assume no consumer's surplus, and the prevailing tariff was taken as the&#13;
willingness to pay.&#13;
12.   Agriculture Consumers. For agriculture consumers it was assumed that 20% of the&#13;
incremental sales would replace diesel pumps, and accordingly, this supply was valued at the&#13;
economic resource cost saving (table 2). The balance 80% of additional electricity supply was&#13;
assumed to be induced consumption. Table 5 gives the corresponding financial costs. The base&#13;
case assumes a strongly convex demand curve, and accordingly takes consumer's surplus benefits&#13;
at 30% of the financial costs of autogeneration. Sensitivity cases I and 2 assume no consumer's&#13;
surplus, and therefore the prevailing tariff was taken as the willingness to pay.&#13;
13.   Results of Economic Valuation of Benefits. The ERR under the base case scenario was&#13;
16.8%. Sensitivity analysis I yielded an ERR of 14.1%, and sensitivity analysis 2 yielded an ERR&#13;
of 13.2%. Details of the computations are shown in table 7.&#13;
14.   Robustness of the Program. Orissa's time-slice ERR is not significantly affected by&#13;
changes in the costs of the investment program and in the implementation schedules of its&#13;
individual components. The Upper Indravati project remains an economically attractive low-cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

source of electricity in spite of its implementation delays. lb units 3-4 have been contracted&#13;
under a power purchase agreement assigning the physical implementation and operation risks to&#13;
its private developer, which in turn is contracting the work to turnkey contractors. GRIDCO&#13;
will under its tariff-setting principles pass on to its clients its power purchase costs and these&#13;
account for the major part of the total costs of the time-slice investment program. The cost of&#13;
GRIDCO's own investments in transmission and distribution will be charged to the consumers as&#13;
well. The program has been designed under the first phase of the reform program and the&#13;
Regulator is expected to allow its costs to be fully passed on to the consumers. A sensitivity&#13;
case with a 10% increase in T&amp;D costs without a change in retail tariff was, nevertheless, carried&#13;
out, yielding an ERR of 16.4%. Another sensitivity case assumed a deceleration in the pace of&#13;
system loss reduction and a 10 % higher ultimate level of losses, without the Regulator allowing&#13;
such higher losses passed on to the consumers (i.e., keeping retail tariffs and therefore benefits&#13;
unchanged). The ERR remains satisfactory at 15.8%. Corresponding ERRs with tariff as the&#13;
measure of economic benefit are indicated in Figure 1. Another sensitivity case established ERRs&#13;
with average tariff revenues 20% lower than projected. In the base case, ERR falls only slightly,&#13;
to about 15.1%, in spite of the significant reduction in tariff revenue, as the measure of benefit is&#13;
only partly related to the tariff. However, in the case where tariff is used directly as the proxy&#13;
for economic benefit (para. 4), as expected the ERR fell significantly, to 8.6%. Project design&#13;
accordingly focuses on the development of the Regulator to help ensure that the utilities will be&#13;
able to adjust their tariffs.&#13;
15.   The impact on the program of lower than projected generation due to lower than&#13;
projected demand is marginal. Current projections show that Orissa will have to initiate two 500&#13;
MW base load generation projects and smaller peak load service projects before the end of the&#13;
time-slice period. A reduction in demand growth would affect the timing of those new projects,&#13;
not the schedule of the generation projects in the time-slice (Upper Indravati and lb units 3-4)&#13;
which would be required in the system before their current implementation-constrained&#13;
commissioning dates. The transmission and distribution rehabilitation program is urgently&#13;
required and only the timing of transmission lines directly associated with new generating&#13;
stations would need to the adjusted. Similarly the impact of load growth on the DSM program is&#13;
marginal, investment under the program are expected to be highly attractive. Time-slice demand&#13;
forecast is essentially a supply forecast (projected output of the generating stations and&#13;
availability of power from NTPC to Orissa during system peak periods) and will be substantially&#13;
lower than projected only in case the supply does not materialize, i.e. in case the stations do not&#13;
generate as much as projected, e.g. due to insufficient fuel supply or lower plant availability.&#13;
That scenario was tested in the sensitivity analysis, by reducing generation from Orissa's stations&#13;
by 10%, yielding an ERR of 15.4%. Finally, another scenario was tested, combining the 10%&#13;
increase in T&amp;D costs, the 10% higher T&amp;D losses, and the 10% lower generation, resulting in&#13;
an ERR of 14.1%. The ERR results are summarized in Figure 1.&#13;

Annex 5.3&#13;
Page 1 of4&#13;
INDIA&#13;
ORISSA POWER SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT&#13;
RISKS AND SAFEGUARDS&#13;
1.    Orissa Government Commitment. The major project risk is Orissa's political&#13;
willingness and capability to implement the reform program. The reform program involves new&#13;
institutional arrangements, tariff adjustments, improved bill collection and addressing power thefts&#13;
and staffing of OSEB and infringes upon social and political interests and long standing&#13;
administrative and other well entrenched traditions. Orissa has demonstrated strong commitment&#13;
to the program and the government and OSEB are implementing the program, including difficult&#13;
and typically unpopular measures on tariffs, collection, subsidies, and are actively pursuing&#13;
privatization. The Orissa government has sought and is receiving support from the Bank, ADB&#13;
and ODA; this has undoubtedly helped maintain the momentum. Without support from the&#13;
central government and adequate financial support from the Bank in particular, the Orissa&#13;
Government may step back. The implementation of the program continues in spite of a change of&#13;
state government in March 1995, demonstrating the extent of political support the program enjoys&#13;
in Orissa, reflecting the widely-shared recognition of the need for a fundamental change in the&#13;
way the power sector has been managed in the past. The new Chief Minister supports the reform&#13;
program and has endorsed its key features and Orissa has submitted a formal statement of its&#13;
power policy.&#13;
2.    In Orissa's political environment and in view of the Orissa government's commitment as&#13;
already demonstrated, the reasonable electricity tariff outlook and the interest already expressed&#13;
by various reputable private investors to take over existing assets and invest in new developments,&#13;
chances for successful reform are therefore considered to be promising, although success can not&#13;
be guaranteed. To support the reform program and help maintain the Orissa government's&#13;
commitment, the Bank intends to continue: (a) the current close involvement in the&#13;
implementation of the reform program in Orissa with intensive supervision; and (b) the active&#13;
dialogue with co-financiers, to help Orissa secure their continued support for the program.&#13;
3.    Management Risks and Safeguards. Orissa's capability to develop and manage the two&#13;
new utilities and the regulatory commission is major project risk is, Orissa's reform commitment&#13;
notwithstanding. Orissa has acknowledged that while technical skills are readily available, the&#13;
required management expertise is in short supply. The boards of directors of GRIDCO and&#13;
OHPC include several non-government part-time directors and both companies will also have&#13;
outside functional directors, for financial, commercial and human resource areas (Annexes 2.4-&#13;
2.5). The Orissa government has invited to GRIDCO's board two individuals who were&#13;
instrumental in the initial institution building of POWERGRID, for ready access to that highly&#13;
relevant experience. As discussed elsewhere in this report, a comprehensive range of external&#13;
support has also been engaged. While a variety of problems will continue to be faced in the&#13;
reform process, the new entities with their outside directors and external support are expected to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.3&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
be able to meet the challenges and maintain reform momentum. Safeguards against future&#13;
government interference in sector management have been built into project design.&#13;
4.    Future Government Interference and Safeguards. Assuming the restructuring part of&#13;
the program continues to be implemented, but prior to private sector participation and in&#13;
particular if distribution privatization gets delayed, the Orissa government may not be able resist&#13;
the temptation to again start interfering in sector management as it continues to own the new&#13;
corporations. Among the many aspects and challenges of the reform program, the Bank has&#13;
consistently in the dialogue with the government highlighted: (a) the development of an&#13;
independent Regulatory Commission, requiring inter alia competent and respected chairman and&#13;
members with fixed staggered terms of appointment, to insulate Orissa's power sector from the&#13;
government and ensure its operational, managerial and financial autonomy, and (b) closely related&#13;
to this, the development of the new utilities with independent management, including inter alia: (i)&#13;
boards of directors with significant non-government participation even if the companies are&#13;
initially wholly-owned by the Orissa government and (ii) competent operational management with&#13;
adequate operational autonomy from their boards of directors. These are critical prerequisites for&#13;
successful reform and have been achieved by Orissa in the initial appointments. Bank review of&#13;
the implementation of the reform would focus and continued Bank support will critically depend&#13;
on the government allowing the persons it has appointed to perform with adequate independence&#13;
and autonomy, as per its power sector policy statement.&#13;
5.    The reform program includes substantial private sector involvement (privatization and/or&#13;
private management) of the most critical part of the system, distribution during program&#13;
implementation. This commitment is reflected in the Orissa government's power policy statement&#13;
and has been separately covenanted under the loan. The Bank: (a) would have remedies under the&#13;
loan agreement to deal with non-compliance; and (b) has an established track record of using&#13;
available remedies (including cancellation of Ln. 2278-IN in 1991 and suspensions of Cr. 1356-IN&#13;
on three different occasions). Minimizing the risks to the Bank by deferring financial support&#13;
after the closing of Cr. 1356-IN would have increased risk and uncertainty to those in Orissa&#13;
implementing the reform program. Deferring Bank approval of the loan would have been&#13;
counter-productive for the implementation of the program. Sirnilarly during the coming years of&#13;
program implementation, the Bank's emphasis will have to be on helping Orissa face both the&#13;
expected and unforeseen challenges in reform implementation in particular at times of trouble.&#13;
6.    Central Government-Related Risks and Safeguards. The draft reform legislation was&#13;
reviewed and finalized in consultation with the central government and the advance clearance and&#13;
President's Assent were secured by the Orissa government ahead of the Bank's loan commitment.&#13;
Through its broader policy dialogue with India, the Bank continues to emphasize the role of&#13;
central government in state power restructuring, for the center to: (a) provide political leadership&#13;
and support to reforming states, (b) undertake the reforms required at the central level to pave the&#13;
way for state power reform; and (c) encourage parallel reform initiatives in other states (and the&#13;
preparation of similar projects has already started in Bihar, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar&#13;
Pradesh).&#13;
7.    Environmental Risks and Safeguards. Overall, the environmental impact of the reform&#13;
program is expected to be positive. Environmental impact assessments of the new thermal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.3&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
generation projects, NTPC Talcher and AES lb units, demonstrate that their emissions will be&#13;
within GOI/Bank Group guidelines. Technical assistance is being provided under the project by&#13;
ODA to help implement the rehabilitation and watershed management plans of the Upper&#13;
Indravati project. Attention has also been paid to ensuring that OHPC and GRIDCO develop&#13;
adequate environmental management capabilities and technical assistance is being provided for&#13;
that purpose.&#13;
8.    Technical Risks in Implementation and Operation and Related Safeguards. The&#13;
project does not pose any particular technical risks in implementation or operation as proven&#13;
technologies will be utilized throughout. Project implementation will follow well-established&#13;
practices by experienced staff, with appropriate technical support arrangements for OHPC (for&#13;
environmental and watershed management) and GRIDCO (engineering and environmental&#13;
including POWERGRID for the T&amp;D rehabilitation program, ODA support for the DSM&#13;
component). Tender documents meeting Bank requirements have already been finalized and used&#13;
under advance procurement (as well as under Cr. 13 56-IN) and by POWERGRID under Ln.&#13;
3237-IN and Ln. 3577-IN. GRIDCO's Project Management Unit includes POWERGRID along&#13;
with GRIDCO's own staff and external consultants.&#13;
9.    Financial/Commercial/Economic Risks and Safeguards. The core investment program&#13;
has been prepared taking into account the utilities' capability to raise resources. The new&#13;
regulatory regime is designed to enable the utilities to recover their costs and earn a reasonable&#13;
return on their investments. The costs of the investments to be made under the proposed Bank&#13;
loan would be recovered under these standard arrangements. Sensitivity analysis established the&#13;
impact of adverse changes on the ERR of the investment program to be acceptable. The results&#13;
clearly demonstrate the need for appropriate pricing of electricity and reinforce the role of the&#13;
Regulatory Commission. The main risk relates to the utilities' ability to recover their charges from&#13;
their clients, generators from GRIDCO, which in turn has to recover from the distributors and&#13;
they ultimately from the electricity consumers. Special attention has therefore been paid in the&#13;
design of the reform program to ensure that the foundation of the sector, power distribution, will&#13;
be developed on the basis of satisfactory commercial policies and arrangements to ensure&#13;
satisfactory revenue recovery. This will be accomplished by transferring distribution to the&#13;
private sector, to specialized private companies whose survival depends on their success in&#13;
addressing Orissa's current problems in distribution.&#13;
10.   The bulk of the future financing of the Orissa power sector is to come from the private&#13;
sector, as indicated in the sector financing plan already in the FY97-FY2003 period. Orissa's first&#13;
private power project is expected to reach financial closure in 1996. The project is supported by&#13;
IFC and will enjoy a Government of India counter-guarantee. Future private generation projects&#13;
are unlikely to obtain a GOI counter-guarantee and will have to depend primarily on the financial&#13;
strength of the client (GRIDCO and later also the private distribution companies) and related&#13;
security arrangements. The forthcoming competitive bidding for Orissa's next private power&#13;
generation project, to be conducted under the reform program (currently in pre-qualification&#13;
stage), will test and is expected to help confirm the sustainability of the structures established&#13;
under the reform program. Bank guarantees may be sought to facilitate the implementation of the&#13;
next 1-2 private power generation projects and distribution privatization (Annex 2.3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.3&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
11.   InstitutionaUContractual Risks and Safeguards. Apart from the conventional&#13;
technical, financial and commercial (revenue recovery) risks to be faced under most power sector&#13;
investments, the reform program introduces additional risks relating to the functioning of the new&#13;
decentralized power system. These risks are being addressed through the preparation (during the&#13;
already-completed phase 1 of the reform program) of comprehensive legal, commercial and&#13;
technical documents (reform legislation and licenses, power purchase agreements and a grid code,&#13;
respectively) to set the new regulatory and operational framework between generators, GRIDCO&#13;
and distributors and during the ongoing phase 2 by providing technical support to the new utilities&#13;
and the Regulatory Commission to help operationalize these new agreements. The role of&#13;
GRIDCO, in addition to being the grid company (i.e. a transmission company and the coordinator&#13;
of system operations) was defined to include power distribution in the short-term and the&#13;
functions of a central power procurement agency in the medium-term inter alia to minimize the&#13;
initial operational complexities during the transition period from the Government/OSEB&#13;
environment to the post-reform commercialized and decentralized industry and market structures.&#13;
Separation of generation from distribution and the creation of more than one distribution company&#13;
are essential design features (Annex 2.3) and justify the additional risk compared to pursuing the&#13;
creation of a vertically-integrated private utility in order to reduce such complexities. It should be&#13;
noted that, given the position of OSEB, its successful privatization as a whole, without&#13;
restructuring, was also regarded to be highly unlikely, making the option of retaining an integrated&#13;
utility academic in the case of Orissa.&#13;
12.   The implementation of the DSM component involves institutional risks as it involves&#13;
not only GRIDCO, but also a large number of electricity end-users and requires their co-operation&#13;
and willingness to invest. Given the modest size of the proposed initial DSM investment under&#13;
the Bank loan, the impact of slower than expected implementation on the overall reform program&#13;
and the loan utilization would not be significant. However, it would defer the initial beneficial&#13;
impact of DSM on the efficiency of electricity use and operation of the power system and future&#13;
wide-scale adoption of DSM in Orissa. The DSM component is therefore accompanied by a large&#13;
technical assistance program to help GRIDCO and the end-users prepare and implement the DSM&#13;
investments. End-users are participating in the Steering Committee to help ensure close&#13;
interaction and communication, and so is the Bhubaneswar branch of the Industrial Development&#13;
Bank of India (IDBI). IDBI's involvement is also expected to substantially facilitate the&#13;
interaction between GRIDCO and the end-users in the industrial sector and help secure the&#13;
successful completion of Orissa first forual DSM program.&#13;
13.   Failure is not an Option. Orissa's power policy statement, the establishment of the new&#13;
utilities with their strengthened management teams, the enactment of the reform legislation and&#13;
the preparatory work on the establishment of the Regulatory Commission, the successive tariff&#13;
adjustments, etc., have placed Orissa firmly on the reform path, but still, only the initial steps&#13;
have so far been taken. The road ahead to functioning utilities, an effective Regulatory&#13;
Commission and an efficient and commercially viable power sector is going to be long and&#13;
winding. Along with progress and successes, the first two years of reform have also involved&#13;
difficulties, frustrations and setbacks and the same mixture is inevitable also in the coming years.&#13;
A reform mantra "Failure is not an Option" has been adopted to emphasize the importance of&#13;
relentless pursuit of reform implementation at times of difficulties.&#13;

            India - Orissa Power Sector Restructuring Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Orissa Power Sector Restructuring
            Project will assist Orissa in: 1) implementing a program of
            regulatory, institutional and tariff reforms in its power
            sector; 2) supporting the institutional development of Grid
            Corporation of Orissa (GRIDCO), Orissa Hydro Power
            Corporation and the new Regulatory Commission established
            under the reform program; 3) reinforcing and rehabilitating
            Orissa's power system and its demand-side management to
            make power supply and consumption more efficient; and 4)
            upgrading the power sector's environmental performance
            and strengthening the environmental management capabilities
            of the new utilities. The project will comprise the
            following components: 1) reinforcement and rehabilitation of
            the transmission and distribution systems and development of
            private power distribution; 2) demand-side management
            initiatives, which will involve a mix of pricing reform,
            metering and other load management and conservation
            strategies designed to increase the incentives to use
            electricity more efficiently; and 3) institutional
            development, training and technical assistance.
