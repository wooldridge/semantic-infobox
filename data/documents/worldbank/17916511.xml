                                the circumstances in      which the Federal Government,     in   January&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                 outlined in the reports before you.          Two years have elapsed&#13;
&#13;
                                 since then and some explanation of this delay is appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
                                 Whil$e it reflects in part some of the peculiar problems,                 r&#13;

&#13;
                                 since the civil war, it also indicates the manner in which&#13;
&#13;
                                 Nigerian authorities have approached their reconstruction&#13;
&#13;
                                 needs in the context of long-term development objectives.&#13;
&#13;
                                           The project's original objective was quite simple:&#13;
&#13;
                                 to reconstruct and rehabilitate war-damaged secondary&#13;
&#13;
                                 schools and primary teacher training colleges in the three&#13;
&#13;
                                 Eastern States.   However, in the process of reviewing their&#13;
&#13;
                                 future manpower needs in the        light of postwar priorities,&#13;
&#13;
                                 the three States decided not only to restore facilities to their&#13;
&#13;
                                 prewar level but also to consolidate and expand them and,&#13;
&#13;
                                 more importantly, to implement reforms in the secondary&#13;
&#13;
                                 school curriculum.    The latter, comprising the strengthening&#13;
&#13;
                                 of science training and the introduction of practical&#13;
&#13;
                                 employment-oriented courses, were already being introduced&#13;
&#13;
                                 experimentally in some secondary schools in the former&#13;

&#13;
                      during appraisal, was modified to include consolidation and&#13;
&#13;
                      expansion of the selected secondary schools and primary&#13;

                      teacher training colleges and the implementation of&#13;
&#13;
                      curriculum reform.        Nearly half the secondary school student&#13;

                      places and nearly three-quarters of the primary teacher&#13;

                      to and expansion of the original rehabilitation project, other&#13;
&#13;
                      less visible but equally important benefits will follow.&#13;
&#13;
                      First, the combination of reconstruction with consolidation ard&#13;
&#13;
                      expansion will result in substantial economies of scale in&#13;
&#13;
                      both construction and equipment.         Moreover,     the concentration&#13;
&#13;
                      in   these expanded schools of the costly,        specialized staff&#13;
&#13;
                      and facilities        required for the reformed secondary school&#13;
&#13;
                      curricula will optimize their use.           Second, the expanded&#13;
&#13;
                      project schools, which will account for about 12 percent,&#13;
&#13;
                      37 percent, and 32 percent of the three States' total seconda y&#13;
&#13;
                      school enrollments by 1974, may be expected to have a&#13;
&#13;
                      considerable        "demonstration effect" on the development of&#13;

&#13;
                                 Education and the associated technical assistance represent&#13;
&#13;
                                 a form of institution building intended to strengthen the&#13;
&#13;
                                 administration of this project, which will hopefully be&#13;
&#13;
                                 adopted in future education projects in other States,&#13;
&#13;
                                 particularly in those new States where executive capacity is&#13;
&#13;
                                 now extremely weak.&#13;
&#13;
                                           To summarize, we believe that this second education&#13;
&#13;
                                 project will, in the longer term, prove to have benefited&#13;
&#13;
                                 from the time taken to prepare it.    In addition, the experien&#13;
&#13;
                                 gained in preparing and implementing it is expected to help&#13;
&#13;
                                 the   Nigerian authorities and the Bank develop a continuing&#13;
&#13;
                                 program of education projects.    In this connection, the&#13;
&#13;
                                 report of the 1971 UNESCO Project Identification Mission&#13;
&#13;
                                 recommended the following priority areas for early action:&#13;
&#13;
                                 primary teacher training, expansion of industrial trAining&#13;
&#13;
                                 at skilled worker and technician levels, expansion and reform&#13;
&#13;
                                 of secondary education, and improved adult education and&#13;
&#13;
                                 agricultural training.   During the next three months, the&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bank expects to prepare and appraise a third education project&#13;
&#13;
                                 probably concentrating on the six Northern States' needs for&#13;
&#13;
                                 improved primary education, including teacher training,&#13;

&#13;
                            Wehave not only three education projects before us, but&#13;
&#13;
                            the population project is also basically an education project&#13;
&#13;
                            because the large part of it is for the training of paramedical&#13;
&#13;
                            personnel.&#13;
&#13;
                                         I think all of these four projects are very&#13;
&#13;
                            commendable and they have my full       support.   But I have two&#13;
&#13;
                            general points which cover all three projects.         Therefore, I&#13;
&#13;
                            will make those points now.&#13;
&#13;

                            other projects, the things that are proposed to be done,&#13;
&#13;
                            need to be done,    and I am very glad that provision is being&#13;
&#13;
                            made for that.     There is   provision for teacher training,&#13;

                             it is only in one project in Turkey that some management&#13;
&#13;
                             training was provided.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Now, in most of these countries, there is a great&#13;
&#13;
                             need for training of management personnel, giving training&#13;
&#13;
                             in business management, administration, but not so much&#13;
&#13;
                             necessarily at the top level because top level people can&#13;
&#13;
                             get training abroad.        But middle level people, there is a&#13;
&#13;
                             great shortage, and a reference to that was made in the&#13;
&#13;
                             education sector paper.       And I feel that this is a very&#13;
&#13;
                             important subject, and I think in the future education&#13;
&#13;
                             projects attention should be paid,      particularly to training of&#13;
&#13;
                             middle level management, business management and also administ1 a-&#13;

&#13;
                                          The second point, Mr. Chairman, that I notice is&#13;
&#13;
                             that in    none of these projects in civil works has the approach&#13;
&#13;
                             of slicing and      packaging been followed.   I thought that these&#13;

&#13;
                     on your second question regarding slicing and packaging&#13;
&#13;

                     would comment on education for middle level management.&#13;

&#13;
                                 MR. BALLANTINE:       Well, I can't speak, Mr. Chairman,&#13;
&#13;
                     too fully about the case of Nigeria except that there is an&#13;

&#13;
                                 MR. McNAMARA:       Speak more generalyabout the middle&#13;

                     management problem that we see in the developing countries and&#13;

                    borne in on us every day.        We are trying to expand our&#13;

                             training, which is training for a less specific market.              It's&#13;
&#13;
                             a broad general market.          It's the basic training that would&#13;
&#13;
                             be provided in an advanced country.&#13;
&#13;
                                       We have an identification of a project forthcoming&#13;
&#13;
                             in Korea identified possibilities for a thing like this, and&#13;
&#13;
                             we will be doing it more and more.&#13;
&#13;
                                       On the middle management level, the other approach&#13;
&#13;
                             would be through the short courses.           And here I think what&#13;
&#13;
                             we are doing in Turkey is the best example.           We have an&#13;
&#13;
                             Institute of Management which is in the project that was&#13;
&#13;
                             recently signed there,         and this   will call for one-year courseE&#13;
&#13;
                             and for a series of short courses which will be offered on&#13;
&#13;
                             specific subjects such as inventory control, personnel&#13;
&#13;
                             management,    etc.    It    involves a very close relationship with&#13;
&#13;
                             the employers.        And although it's not in the project, the systei&#13;
&#13;
                             that has been developed in Turkey under the Turkish&#13;
&#13;
                             Management Association calls not only for training of manager&#13;
&#13;
                             in institutions in          either short or long courses,   but also forl&#13;
&#13;
                             consulting services which will be sent out to firms that&#13;
&#13;
                             will enable them within the firm to improve their management&#13;
&#13;
                             practices.&#13;
&#13;
                                           These are,         very briefly stated, the range of&#13;
&#13;
                             approaches that we feel we can make.            I should point out&#13;

&#13;
                                        MR. McNAMARA:   I think it depends on what middle&#13;
&#13;
                              level management means.   If you're thinking about rural&#13;
&#13;
                              areas, and certainly a large part of our problem in education&#13;
&#13;
                              is educating for increased efficiency in rural areas,&#13;
&#13;
                              agricultural production, our agricultural vocational training,&#13;
&#13;
                              particularly for extention agents, goes a long way toward&#13;
&#13;
                              meeting that.&#13;
&#13;
                                        One of the real problems we face in this Bank is&#13;
&#13;
                              developing project managers for agricultural projects.     And&#13;
&#13;
                              we are giving increasing attention to that.&#13;
&#13;
                                        In the industrial sector, middle level management&#13;
&#13;
                              there, the Turkish approach, the efforts to assist firms to&#13;
&#13;
                              do their own middle level management teaching is something&#13;
&#13;
                              we will want to give increased attention to.   Taiwan, for&#13;
&#13;
                              example, has an extraordinarily effective program of that&#13;
&#13;
                              kind.&#13;
&#13;
                                        I don't think we have gone very far, frankly, in&#13;
&#13;
                              developing training for middle level management, if you want&#13;
&#13;
                            1! to call it the foreman level, the middle supervisory level&#13;
&#13;
                              for industry.   The Turkish experiment is the most noteworthy&#13;

&#13;
                                      already, it seems to be an education day, and that encourages&#13;
&#13;
                                      me to say a few words on education as such.&#13;
&#13;
                                                The projects.before us, three of them, or at least&#13;
&#13;
                                      the two first, follow more or less a certain line which favors&#13;
&#13;
                                      the improvement of secondary education.     But in all the&#13;
&#13;
                                      appraisal reports it says that the primary education remains&#13;
&#13;
                                      much to be desired and as a matter of fact, if you read the&#13;
&#13;
                                      passages on what is said about primary education in those&#13;
&#13;
                                      countries, it's really a matter of concern.&#13;
&#13;
                                                   Now, Mr. Chairman, I am very much concerned --    I am&#13;
&#13;
                                      much more concerned pken&amp;ntly about primary education than&#13;
&#13;
                                      I am about secondary education.     And I am very much concerned&#13;
&#13;
                                      about the fact whether we are not trying to build the first&#13;

                                      floor and improve the first floor of a house before we have&#13;
&#13;
                                      considered the basement at all.     And I think that's a basic&#13;
&#13;
                                      consideration which is not limited to less developed&#13;
&#13;
                                      countries.     It's a basic consideration going right through&#13;

&#13;
                              I think that's teally what we should be concerned about, to&#13;

&#13;
                              say that the Bank as such should dedicate more attention to&#13;
&#13;
                              the primary education, to the training of teachers for&#13;
&#13;
                              primary education, and on top of that to adult education.&#13;
&#13;
                                        One can find these priorities, these problems, as&#13;
&#13;
                              I said, even in the richest country, and a few of us have&#13;

                              just recently had the opportunity to go to California on a&#13;
&#13;
                              trip and we found there that even in the United States, the&#13;
&#13;
                              facts are there that neglecting primary education costs an&#13;
&#13;
                              enormous amount to the economy.&#13;
&#13;
                                        Now, that leads me to the consideration and to&#13;

                              emphasize too much on secondary education but to help those&#13;
&#13;
                              less-developed countries, and I think many developed countries&#13;
&#13;
                              need help in this case, too, to improve,basically improve,&#13;

                              primary education.   Because in my opinion, only the best&#13;
&#13;
                              teachers should be available for primary education because&#13;
&#13;
                              that's the age where the child is really formed and built.&#13;

&#13;
                                     Mr. Ballantine, would you comment on our attitude&#13;
&#13;
                           toward primary education?&#13;
&#13;
                                     MR. BALLANTINE:     Mr. Chairman, Members of the Board,&#13;
&#13;
                           this   subject has had a long history in our dealing with&#13;
&#13;
                           education, and at the beginning it was almost arbitrarily&#13;
&#13;
                           excluded as not being one of the priorities.&#13;
&#13;
                                     You will recall that in the submission of an&#13;
&#13;
                           education policy paper a year ago last summer, the point was&#13;
&#13;
                           made that we should not have a priori areas of eligibility&#13;
&#13;
                           but that we should analyze the needs of the education training&#13;
&#13;
                           sector as a whole and determine within the framework of the&#13;
&#13;
                           Bank's major objectives, its declared objectives, what would&#13;
&#13;
                           be the priority items.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Now, I think the first thing we have to recognize&#13;
&#13;
                           is that all of these countries we are dealing with have&#13;
&#13;
                           extreme constraints, financial and resource constraints,&#13;
&#13;
                           and that therefore the matter of priority is perhaps as&#13;
&#13;
                           urgent in this sector as it is in any one, particularly&#13;
&#13;
                           considering that investment is not revenue capturing, that&#13;
&#13;
                           is to say, it requires a continued recurrent expenditure&#13;
&#13;
                           in order to sustain the operation.       And this has to be our&#13;
&#13;
                           guideline much more than the level of investment.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    That being so, we tried to approach the question&#13;
&#13;
                           of priorities not in terms exclusively of building an&#13;
&#13;
                           educational system, let alone a formal one.    As you know, we&#13;
&#13;
                           are trying to broaden our view and take a look at the non-&#13;
&#13;
                           formal and the formal together, but certainly not simply in&#13;
&#13;
                           the sense of building up a formal education system.&#13;
&#13;
                                     The point of reference that we prefer to use is&#13;
&#13;
                           what will be the role that will be played, the economic or&#13;
&#13;
                           in some cases the social role that will be played by a student&#13;
&#13;
                           when he leaves that particular level of education.     And using&#13;
&#13;
                           that and using the need to man the systems, both private and&#13;
&#13;
                           public sector systems, of newly developed countries with&#13;
&#13;
                           very poor stocks of manpower, we have to conclude that by&#13;
&#13;
                           those strict criteria, primary education often has a lower&#13;
&#13;
                           priority, in terms of enabling people to govern and manage&#13;
&#13;
                           and operate the country effectively.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Now, as our sector paper said recently when it was&#13;
&#13;
                           presented to you last summer, we find that in certain countrie&#13;
&#13;
                           there is a growing saturation or approaching th point of&#13;
&#13;
                           saturation in secondary education.     We feel also that the new&#13;
&#13;
                           objectives and trends in our thinking that are coming forward,&#13;
&#13;
                           such as the maximizing, the distribution of income, and so&#13;
&#13;
                           forth, call for a somewhat wider look, and we would feel, and I&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     agree, I think, with Mr.   Wolf that primary education is&#13;
&#13;
                     achieving a much higher priority in our thinking than it has&#13;
&#13;
                     held in the past when we concentrated our attention more on&#13;
&#13;
                     the secondary, on the technical, and vocational fields.&#13;
&#13;
                               It's a question of how much the country can sustain&#13;
&#13;
                     in terms of recurrent expenditure, what the vlume of our&#13;
&#13;
                     investment is, what the degree of maturity of the system is,&#13;
&#13;
                     andhow far we have gone in the direction of specifically&#13;
&#13;
                     meeting manpower needs.&#13;
&#13;
                               But I certainly, Mr. Chairman, would have no&#13;
&#13;
                     argument whatsoever with the proposition that the gradual&#13;
&#13;
                     extension of an improved --   and I underline an improved --&#13;
&#13;
                     primary education should be a concern of ours.&#13;
&#13;
                               I might add just one more point.      This Board did&#13;
&#13;
                     agree, I believe, with a policy which was expressed in that&#13;
&#13;
                     policy paper, and again in the sector paper, that we should&#13;
&#13;
                     consider experimental projects in primary education which&#13;
&#13;
                     gave promise of greater efficiency, relevance, or economy,&#13;
&#13;
                     and we have begun to do that.    We still are approaching it&#13;
&#13;
                     through primary teacher training primarily, but we would be&#13;
&#13;
                     prepared to offer you projects which were experimental by the&#13;
&#13;
                     description I have just given.&#13;

&#13;
                            The problem varies in different countries.   In&#13;
&#13;
               some countries with 90 percent enrollment of the primary&#13;
&#13;
               age group in school, the problem is ensuring some reasonable&#13;
&#13;
               degree of, I will call it, efficiency and relevance.      With&#13;
&#13;
               dropout rates as high as 60 and 75 percent in some of these&#13;
&#13;
               cases, the whole system is inefficient at the primary level&#13;
&#13;
               and with relevance completely lacking because either the&#13;
&#13;
               primary curriculum is directed toward movement of that entire&#13;
&#13;
               group up into the secondary level which is impossible to&#13;
&#13;
               finance in the area, or alternatively it does not prepare them&#13;
&#13;
                for a terminal relationship to primary education.    Curricula&#13;
&#13;
               revision is necessary.&#13;
&#13;
                            In other areas, and Ethiopia is a good illustration&#13;
&#13;
               with a very low rate of attendance in the primary schools,&#13;
&#13;
               15 percent, I think, 85 percent of the primary aged group not&#13;
&#13;
               attending school, the nonformal programs that Mr. Ballantine&#13;
&#13;
               mentioned will become increasingly important.     As I think our&#13;
&#13;
               Board knows, we have a research project under way now dealing&#13;
&#13;
               with that subject.     We don't know how to deal with non-formal&#13;
&#13;
               education.     I think we budgeted $250,000, something like that,&#13;
&#13;
               included in the last budget that the Board reviewed last May.&#13;
&#13;
               And I am very hopeful that project will throw some light on&#13;
&#13;
               how to deal with a problem such as Ethiopia's.     It is a very&#13;

&#13;
                           amplify your point about Ethiopia by way of illustration.&#13;
&#13;
                                      In 1970-71, Ethiopia has about a 15 percent enroll-&#13;
&#13;
                           ment of the primary age group.        It has 3.6 percent in the&#13;
&#13;
                           secondary, and substantially less than one-half of one percent&#13;
&#13;
                           in the higher education.       And it is spending 19 percent of&#13;
&#13;
                           its total budget on education.        We have projected these&#13;
&#13;
                           figures ahead to 1978, and we find that at that time, if&#13;
&#13;
                           they achieve a level of 20 percent in primary enrollment,&#13;
&#13;
                           of about 6 percent in secondary enrollment, and still less&#13;
&#13;
                           than one-half of one percent in higher education enrollment,&#13;
&#13;
                           they will then be spending 25 percent of their budget.              And&#13;
&#13;
                           this rapid increase in the absorption of educational expenditure&#13;
&#13;
                           the commitment to recurrent expenditure, I think, is a very&#13;
&#13;
                           clear illustration of the problems that countries face if&#13;

&#13;
                                       MR. McNAMARA:      You might comment on how we package&#13;
&#13;
                             some of these educational projects.&#13;
&#13;
                                       PR. CHADENET:      I think in this case I would like&#13;
&#13;
                             Mr. Hammerschmidt to help me, but I think in this case we package&#13;
&#13;
                             by groups of three to five schools.&#13;
&#13;
                                       MR. McNAMARA:      Mr. Hammerschmidt, would you come&#13;
&#13;
                             to the table.&#13;
&#13;
                                       MR. HAMMERSCHMIDT:      Mr. Chairman, the map at the&#13;
&#13;
                             back of the report will show how the schools are distributed&#13;
&#13;
                             over the country,     and the Government would call for tenders&#13;
&#13;
                             for two schools or three schools or four or five, as it is&#13;
&#13;
                             practical in accordance with the distribution.&#13;
&#13;
                                        So a builder would be able to bid for one school&#13;
&#13;
                             or for five in    accordance with his capacity.&#13;

                                        Mr. Chairman, let me enter into a slightly different&#13;
&#13;
                             aspect of the project.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Nigeria is a country in a rather special situation.&#13;
&#13;
                             Due to the oil boom, the balance of payments prospect is very&#13;
&#13;
                             good.   But at the same time the country is lacking the human&#13;

                         resources needed to make adequate use of the excess external&#13;
&#13;
                         resources.    Since this situation is to a certain extent&#13;
&#13;
                         shared by some other countries, countries with large oil&#13;
&#13;
                         and ore mineral resources, like Venezuela, I think it&#13;
&#13;
                         deserves our careful consideration if we are to avoid a wastage&#13;
&#13;
                         of resources and to promote an effective growth in those&#13;
&#13;
                         countries.&#13;
&#13;
                                   I think that for this country, Nigeria, the&#13;
                                                       the&#13;
                         present education project and / coming review of Bank financing&#13;
&#13;
                         are two important steps in the right direction.     However,&#13;
&#13;
                         although in paragraph 21, the paper recognizes that project&#13;
&#13;
                         preparation and investment capacity are the major development&#13;
&#13;
                         constraints, it looks like most of the burden of solving&#13;
&#13;
                         this problem is on the Government side.&#13;
&#13;
                                      I wonder if the Bank is playing or is going to&#13;
&#13;
                         play a role more active than usual in identifying and prepari g&#13;
&#13;
                         Government projetts in Nigeria, not only those to be&#13;
&#13;
                         financed by the Bank, but also other projects which could take&#13;
&#13;
                         advantage of the potential resource position?&#13;

                                             MR. CHAUFOURNIER:   Well, I think it is our judgment&#13;
&#13;
                                   that Nigeria is penalized by its inability to prepare a&#13;
&#13;
                                   sufficient number of projects, and our willingness to help in&#13;
&#13;
                                   this field has been known to Nigeria for some time.    Actually&#13;
&#13;
                                   when we decided to establish a resident mission in Nigeria,&#13;
&#13;
                                   we had in mind that this resident mission could do in&#13;
&#13;
                                   Nigeria what the West African mission in Abidjan does     for&#13;

&#13;
                                   Nigerians, they felt that immediately after the end of the&#13;
&#13;
                                   war the problems of relations between the Federal Government&#13;
&#13;
                                   and the States and the fact that responsibility for prepara-&#13;
&#13;
                                   tion of projects was given to the individual States, it&#13;
&#13;
                                   required for them to think out carefully their development&#13;
&#13;
                                   plan before organizing substantial technical assistance in&#13;
&#13;
                                   this field.   They agreed that the field of transportation,&#13;
&#13;
                                   which was one very urgent in which they required our&#13;
&#13;
                                   assistance, they would welcome Bank staff, and we are now&#13;
&#13;
                                   stationing someone in Lagos for that:purpose.&#13;

                                As you have noted from the President's report, we&#13;

                    have not yet defined the final strategy vis-a-vis Nigeria,&#13;

                    this will come out of our discussions in our recent economic&#13;

                    mission.    But that   nission paid particular attention to the&#13;
&#13;
                    point you have      raised, and we very much plan to help Nigeria&#13;
&#13;
                    in   this area.&#13;

                                MR.   REYNOLDS:   Mr.   Chairman,     back on the question&#13;
&#13;
                    of planning and priorities, we had one point.            We noticed&#13;
&#13;
                    in paragraph 28 of your report there is a discussion of the&#13;
&#13;
                    inadequacies of general educational planning in Nigeria.&#13;
&#13;
                    The paragraph concludes with a notation that the Federal&#13;
&#13;
                    Government is considering the establishment of a commission&#13;
&#13;
                    of some kind to study the general educational system.             This&#13;
&#13;
                    makes us wonder whether consideration was given to the&#13;
&#13;
                    possibility of including provision for some such study in&#13;
&#13;
                    this project.      Perhaps the question is now more relevant to&#13;
&#13;
                    future projects.&#13;
&#13;
                                MR. McNAMARA:     Mr. Pearce, would you comment on that,&#13;

&#13;
                                                 UNESCO has recently looked at the educational&#13;
&#13;
                                 sector     in    Nigeria last      year,         and for that reason we are&#13;
&#13;
                                 not including any funds in               this     project for that purpose.&#13;
&#13;
                                                 MR.   McNAMARA:     Is    there need for a national&#13;

                                 education study of the kind, for example, we financed in&#13;

&#13;
                                 year is almost parallel to the one done in Malaysia.                     They&#13;
&#13;
                                 put in a much bigger team, a very comprehensive group of&#13;
&#13;
                                 people, and have produced quite a good report.                     So the work&#13;
&#13;
                                 is   parallel to that done in Malaysia.&#13;

                                                 MR. McNAMARA:       Therefore, you did concluded it              k&#13;
                                 wasn't necessary to finance an additional study.&#13;

                                                 MR. BURT:       Well, this is quite a new idea for the&#13;

                                 Nigerians to provide this commission.                     They are only just&#13;

            Transcript of joint meeting of the

            This is a joint meeting of the Executive
            Directors of International Bank for Reconstruction and
            Development (IBRD) and International Development Association
            (IDA), to the recommendation loan in the amount of $17.3
            million to Nigeria for an education project. The
            project's original objective was quite simple: to
            reconstruct and rehabilitate war-damaged secondary schools
            and primary teacher training colleges in the three Eastern
            States. However, in the process of reviewing their future
            manpower needs in the light of postwar priorities, the three
            States decided not only to restore facilities to their
            prewar level but also to consolidate and expand them and,
            more importantly, to implement reforms in the secondary
            school curriculum. Nearly half the secondary school student
            places and nearly three-quarters of the primary teacher
            training college places to be financed by the proposed loan
            represent additions to these institutions' prewar
            enrollment capacity. Apart from the obvious advantage of
            this modification to and expansion of the original
            rehabilitation project, other less visible but equally
            important benefits will follow.
