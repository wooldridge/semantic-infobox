Note No. 87   Price Caps, Rate-of-Return Regulation,&#13;
and the Cost of Capital&#13;
Jan Alexander     This Note compares the effects of price cap and rate-of-return regulation on the risks borne by&#13;
and Timothy      regulated utilities. It presents evidence that price cap regulation subjects firms to greater risks&#13;
InrIn1&#13;
and therefore raises their cost of capital. This result has one clear implication: firms regulated by&#13;
price caps must be permitted to earn higher returns. If they are not, they will be unable to attract&#13;
new investment capital and the quality of their service will decline.&#13;

            This Note compares the effects of price
            cap and rate-of-return regulation on the risk borne by
            regulated utilities. It present evidence that price cap
            regulation subjects firms to greater risks and therefore
            raises their cost of capital. This result has one clear
            implication: firms regulated by price caps must be permitted
            to earn higher returns.  If they are not, they will be
            unable to attract new investment capital and the quality of
            their service will decline.
