&amp;#12;       Regional Workshop on the Role of Teachersâ&#128;&#153; Unions in Improving Education Quality&#13;

                                            FINAL REPORT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Role of Teachers in Education Quality&#13;
&#13;
Teachers, as the primary education service delivery agents, play a lead role in what, how, and how much&#13;
studentâ&#128;&#153;s learn, including among disadvantaged populations. Yet, often governmentsâ&#128;&#153; education reform&#13;
efforts are confronted with strong resistance from teacher unions. This global pattern is even stronger in&#13;
MENA where, in many countries, the relationship between unions and Ministries of Education is&#13;
characterized by lack of trust and persistent tension, resulting in little to no involvement of teachersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
representatives in the design of key education reforms.&#13;
&#13;
Teacher unionsâ&#128;&#153; resistance to reform is a global pattern. However, traditional unionism in education has&#13;
recently begun to reinvent itself and respond to the challenges involved in education quality. There&#13;
various experiences around the world showing positive outcomes of constructive collaboration with&#13;
teachersâ&#128;&#153; representative organizations. Very recently, a new movement in unionism is becoming more and&#13;
more evident: professional or â&#128;&#152;newâ&#128;&#153; unionism is based on the idea that unions can contribute to&#13;
educational improvement and in this vein there are many examples from around the world pointing to&#13;
innovative ways in which these organizations encourage and lead reform.&#13;
&#13;
Teacher Union Workshop&#13;
&#13;
Building on a growing body of evidence from around the world which reveal positive outcomes from&#13;
constructive collaboration between unions and governments, the World Bank has initiated a discussion&#13;
with the Arab Teacher Unions about new unionism. In collaboration with ALECSO and the Queen Rania&#13;
Teacher Academy, partners in the Arab Regional Agenda for Improving Education Quality (ARAIEQ),&#13;
the World Bank organized the Regional Workshop on the Role of Teachers Unions in Improving&#13;
Education Quality. The workshop was financed by the Governance Accountability Fund (GAC) with&#13;
complementary funding from QRTA through the Arab Program for Teacher Policies (APTP) component&#13;
of ARAIEQ. The workshop took place in Casablanca, Morocco on January 8-9, 2015 with over 40&#13;
participants from 11 Arab countries (See list of participants in Annex II).&#13;
&#13;
The workshop provided a platform for knowledge sharing of good practices for unionsâ&#128;&#153; engagement in&#13;
improving the performance of the education sector. The workshop was organized around 3 main&#13;
sequences: the current status of Teacher Unions and Associations (TUA) in the Arab Region;&#13;
international and regional initiatives of TUA collaboration to improve education quality; and discussion&#13;
and brainstorming on the way forward for better engagement in improving education quality.&#13;
&#13;
PART I: Current Status of Teacher Unions in the Region&#13;
&#13;
To kick off the workshop, results from the MENA Regional SABER Teachers Report were shared with&#13;
participants. The presentation described the main factors that affect teacher performance in the region and&#13;
explained intent versus de facto gap in the actual implementation of teacher policies and pointed to&#13;
specific issues, such as teacher absenteeism that affect the quality of education in the region. Prior to the&#13;
workshop a brief participant survey was distributed to all participants. The survey included questions on&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                           3&#13;
&amp;#12;the current issues faced by TUAs in the region as well as allowed for participants to begin to explore&#13;
ways forward. The survey results were shared and helped to frame the discussion around the issues faced&#13;
by TUAs specific to the region (See Annex X).&#13;
&#13;
PART II: International and Region Initiatives to Improve Education Quality&#13;
&#13;
The second portion of the workshop included international and regional case studies of successful TUA&#13;
contributions to education quality, including through enhanced TUA-government collaboration. Mark&#13;
Simon, education policy analyst and long-time teacher union member, presented on the progressive new&#13;
union example of teacher evaluation reform in Montgomery County, U.S.A. The Montgomery Country&#13;
Public Schoolsâ&#128;&#153; experience (MPCS) included the establishment of a teacher Peer Assistance and Review&#13;
system (PAR). The main feature of the PAR, which is overseen jointly by management and the union, is a&#13;
team of experienced and well qualified teachers (consulting teachers) who are tasked with supporting&#13;
teacher improvement as well as teacher evaluation (they may also recommend continuation or termination&#13;
of contracts). The PAR system achieved positive results with lower teacher turn-over, improved students&#13;
results and narrowed achievement gaps.&#13;
&#13;
Nina Bascia, Professor at the University of Toronto, discussed the importance of teacher unions in the&#13;
education world and shared positive examples of proactive teacher unions in England, South Africa and&#13;
Canada. She stressed the need for teacher unions to remain proactive in their roles, and led a frank&#13;
discussion on the importance of building partnerships and working alongside the government. She&#13;
highlighted the experience of the South African Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU) which developed&#13;
a framework for teacher professional learning and is currently delivering professional learning activities&#13;
across the country. She also spoke about the Alberta Teachers Association (Canada) which launched an&#13;
aggressive advocacy program for education quality and eventually won additional funding for the sector.&#13;
&#13;
Promising experiences from the MENA region were also shared. Javier Vaquero from the Spanish&#13;
Foundation, ISCOD and Hamid Nahhass of the Moroccan Teacher Union, SNE-FDT, co-presented on an&#13;
ongoing joint project between ISCOD and SNE-FDT on improving the quality of education in Morocco&#13;
through the prevention of child labor and reduction of school drop outs. They shared the results of the 10-&#13;
year project and detailed the two project strategies responsible for creating child labor-free zones&#13;
including preventative and curative approaches. Representatives from Kuwait, Egypt and Mauritania&#13;
highlighted their achievements including ongoing projects done in collaboration with the government. In&#13;
Morocco, the Democratic labor federationâ&#128;&#153;s teacher union teamed up with various international partners&#13;
to address school drop-out in poor areas through training and support to teachers, students, parents and&#13;
local NGOs. The Kuwaiti Teachers Association has put in place a program for professional development&#13;
and teaching support material. In Egypt, the teachers union has an ambitious plan to build teacher training&#13;
centers in every governorate.&#13;
&#13;
PART III: Way Forward for Better TUA Engagement in Improving Quality of Education&#13;
&#13;
One of the principal objectives for the workshop was to provide an opportunity for participants to share&#13;
and develop strategies for improved TUA-government collaboration in order to improve the quality of&#13;
education. Oliver Liang, Sectoral Specialist for Education (ILO), presented on the role of social dialogue&#13;
and interest based bargaining in the education world. He introduced mutual gains bargaining as a more&#13;
sustainable collaboration strategy between TUAs and governments, whereby both parties are actively&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                         4&#13;
&amp;#12;engaged in bargaining on shared interests instead of positions. According to Oliver, the strategy would&#13;
allow for all parties to partake in joint exploration of interests, research, sharing of information, and&#13;
discussion of options.&#13;
&#13;
The workshop concluded with an activity that allowed for participants to brainstorm on â&#128;&#156;way forwardâ&#128;?&#13;
strategies for successful TUA-government collaboration. Participants were allotted time to discuss and&#13;
vote on the most essential areas of future collaboration with the government and civil society. The three&#13;
priority areas included: establishing criteria for teacher selection and deployment; participation of the&#13;
unions in framing educational policies; and establishment of an effective partnership with civil society.&#13;
&#13;
The regional workshop in Casablanca was an eye-opener in more than one way: it showed that teacher&#13;
unions in MENA are changing the way they perceive their own role as a key stakeholder in the education&#13;
sector. Instead of just confronting government education reforms, teacher unions can choose to be a&#13;
partner of reform efforts or even a source of the reforms themselves. A growing commitment to&#13;
improving education quality appears to be the common ground for such a paradigm shift in education&#13;
unionism. This is reflected in three specific directions for the future: increasing participation in teacher&#13;
professional development activities; taking a leadership role in facilitating and disseminating education&#13;
innovation among practitioners in schools; and contributing to a richer and better informed public debate&#13;
on education.&#13;

&amp;#12;ANNEX III: Speaker Bios&#13;
&#13;
Nina Bascia is Professor and Chair of the Department of Theory and Policy Studies in Education at the&#13;
Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto, Canada. Professor Basciaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
research interests include, among many other areas, TUAs. She is the author of Unions in Teachersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
Professional Lives (1990) and the far-reaching and comprehensive article â&#128;&#156;Teacher Unions and&#13;
Educational Reformâ&#128;? (2005). Her latest article â&#128;&#156;Teacher Unionâ&#128;&#148;Governmental Relations in the Context&#13;
of Educational Reform: an International Perspectiveâ&#128;? (in draft form) offers case studies that reveal the&#13;
impact and successes of new unionism in England, the countries of Scandinavia, the province of Alberta&#13;
in Canada, and South Africa. Professor Bascia would be able to talk on the History of New Unionism and&#13;
also on New Unionism around the World. In addition, she would be able to recommend one or more&#13;
speakers from the countries discussed in her case studies. She suggests, for instance, a representative of&#13;
the Albertaâ&#128;&#153;s Teachers Association (ATA). Under the oppositional Klein government, the ATA&#13;
recognized that their usual approach would no longer work, so they began a Public Education Campaign&#13;
that was so successful the government relinquished its hostile stance and began to work with the ATA.&#13;
&#13;
Kamel Braham is the Program Leader for Education, Health and Social Protection for the Maghreb in&#13;
the Middle East and North Africa Region of the World Bank. He joined the World Bank in 2006 and&#13;
worked on education and capacity building issues in North Africa and the Middle East, Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa and East Asia. He was successively the Administrator of the World Bank Institute Scholarship&#13;
Program and the Task Team leader for the World Bank education program in Iraq and in Yemen. Before&#13;
joining the Bank, he worked for UNESCO and held several senior positions in the Tunisian Ministry of&#13;
Higher Education, and Economic and Social Council.&#13;
&#13;
Oliver Liang is the sectoral specialist for education, culture and media in the Sectoral Policies&#13;
Department of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in Geneva, Switzerland. He coordinates the&#13;
secretariat of the Joint ILO/UNESCO Committee of Experts on the Status of Teaching Personnel and&#13;
promotes standards on education and teachers. Most recently, he served as Executive-Secretary of the&#13;
Meeting of Experts which adopted the ILO policy guidelines on the promotion of decent work for early&#13;
childhood education personnel. Oliver also works on employment aspects of the media and culture&#13;
industries. Oliver previously served as manager of development cooperation policy at ILO, and as&#13;
coordinator of the information services on international labour standards. Oliver holds a PhD from the&#13;
Johns Hopkins University in the United States and has taught history and language at various educational&#13;
institutions.&#13;
&#13;
Mark Simon serves as co-coordinator of the Mooney Institute for Teacher and Union Leadership,&#13;
working in the state of Maryland with the George Washington University Graduate School of Education&#13;
and Human Development on supporting and cultivating National Board for Professional Teaching&#13;
Standards candidates in high need schools. He could present a very interesting discussion on the different&#13;
ways two geographically-close school districts (Washington, DC and Montgomery County, Maryland)&#13;
chose to support teacher improvement. His excellent article, â&#128;&#156;A Tale of Two Districts,â&#128;? describes these&#13;
two contrasting approaches which reveal valuable insights into the new ways unions can act.&#13;

      prepares future generations for leading the country&#13;
      5. Non-existent of proactive management&#13;
      6. Schools do not have autonomy or an independent budget&#13;
      7. Mixing the responsibilities between the center, the other administration levels and the schools&#13;
&#13;
      Main solutions:&#13;
      1. Make a fundamental restructuring of the administration of the education system nation-wide&#13;
      with focusing on decentralization and school autonomy&#13;
      2. School-based reform&#13;
      3. Establish criteria for selecting leaders&#13;
      4. Improve school management&#13;
      5. Improve school autonomy and provide schools with an independent budget&#13;
      6. Re-establish the school's role to become a place for preparing future leaders&#13;

            Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
            conference on role of teachers unions in improving quality
            of education
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Teachers, as the primary education
            service delivery agents, play a lead role in what, how, and
            how much student’s learn, including among disadvantaged
            populations. Yet, often governments’ education reform
            efforts are confronted with strong resistance from teacher
            unions. This global pattern is even stronger in MENA where,
            in many countries, the relationship between unions and
            Ministries of Education is characterized by lack of trust
            and persistent tension, resulting in little to no
            involvement of teachers’ representatives in the design of
            key education reforms. Teacher unions’ resistance to reform
            is a global pattern. However, traditional unionism in
            education has recently begun to reinvent itself and respond
            to the challenges involved in education quality. There
            various experiences around the world showing positive
            outcomes of constructive collaboration with teachers’
            representative organizations. Very recently, a new movement
            in unionism is becoming more and more evident: professional
            or ‘new’ unionism is based on the idea that unions can
            contribute to educational improvement and in this vein there
            are many examples from around the world pointing to
            innovative ways in which these organizations encourage and
            lead reform. The workshop provided a platform for knowledge
            sharing of good practices for unions’ engagement in
            improving the performance of the education sector. The
            workshop was organized around three main sequences: the
            current status of Teacher Unions and Associations (TUA) in
            the Arab Region; international and regional initiatives of
            TUA collaboration to improve education quality; and
            discussion and brainstorming on the way forward for better
            engagement in improving education quality.
