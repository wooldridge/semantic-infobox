A Review of EcoSan Experience&#13;
in Eastern and Southern Africa&#13;

Many governments and agencies in Africa are exploring the role of ecological sanitation, or EcoSan, within&#13;
their environmental sanitation and hygiene improvement programs. Despite convincing environmental and&#13;
economic reasons to support this approach, acceptance of the technology has been very limited so far.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The scale of the sanitation crisis in&#13;
Africa is enormous: 43 percent of the&#13;
population of Sub Saharan Africa ­ over&#13;
303 million people ­ had no access&#13;
to basic sanitation in the year 2000.1&#13;
Between 1990 and 2000, the number&#13;
of people gaining access to improved&#13;
sanitation failed to keep pace with&#13;
population growth. The combination&#13;
of poor progress, population growth,&#13;
extremely weak economies and&#13;
sometimes civil strife mean that the&#13;
MDG targets facing Africa, seem almost&#13;
insurmountable. This clearly means that&#13;
`business as usual' is not an option.&#13;
&#13;
Many governments and agencies&#13;
in Africa are exploring the role of&#13;
ecological sanitation, or EcoSan,&#13;
within their environmental sanitation&#13;
and hygiene improvement programs.&#13;
Despite convincing environmental&#13;
and economic reasons to support&#13;
this approach, acceptance of the&#13;
technology has been very limited so&#13;
far. This field note reviews experience&#13;

Southern Africa. The aim is:&#13;

· to identify as many successful&#13;
     EcoSan projects and programs as&#13;
     possible and to learn from these&#13;
     experiences; and,&#13;
· to understand why take-up of&#13;
     EcoSan has been so limited, and&#13;
     to use this information to improve&#13;
     future sanitation programs.&#13;
&#13;
In its broadest sense, EcoSan ranges&#13;
from simply planting a tree on a disused   A urine-diversion toilet near Mombasa, Kenya. The urine is collected in the plastic container.&#13;

of an appropriate marketing strategy,&#13;
suggests that the large-scale success&#13;
of the dry urine-diversion toilet has&#13;
been achieved by marketing it around&#13;
social factors rather than the benefits of&#13;
excreta reuse. Wide scale acceptance&#13;
is attributed to the choice householders&#13;
had between different technologies&#13;
and because ecological sanitation best&#13;
satisfied social requirements, given the&#13;
water, geological and cost constraints.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Some success with re-use of excreta is&#13;
also reported. "Two methods of dealing&#13;
with the pit contents have emerged:&#13;
burning or composting/burying. Burning&#13;
has been successful because of the&#13;
very dry climate and the use of hard&#13;
instead of soft toilet paper. Composting&#13;
is relatively new, as the first pits have&#13;
only recently required emptying. People&#13;
have realized how innocuous the&#13;
contents are and have had no problem&#13;
in emptying the pits and burying the&#13;
contents.&#13;

Appropriateness&#13;
&#13;
Some of the problems described&#13;
above such as abandoned new toilets&#13;
or poor operations and maintenance&#13;
are the result of poor program design&#13;
and inappropriate technology. These&#13;
difficulties are hardly unique to EcoSan;&#13;

record of the failure of numbers of&#13;

            A review of EcoSan experience in Eastern
            and Southern Africa
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Many governments and agencies in Africa
            are exploring the role of ecological sanitation, or EcoSan,
            within their environmental sanitation and hygiene
            improvement programs. The aim is to identify as many
            successful EcoSan projects as possible and to learn from
            these experiences; and, to understand why take-up of Ecosan
            has been so limited, and to use this information to improve
            future sanitation programs. Despite convincing environmental
            and economic reasons to support this approach, acceptance of
            the technology has been very limited so far. This field note
            reviews experience in Eastern Africa and, with less detail,
            Southern Africa.
