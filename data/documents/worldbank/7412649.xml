          malaria, diarrhea and respiratory infections.                  hygiene promotion. Consequently, hygiene promotion is a&#13;
                                                                         topic for review and improvement at Nam Saat. The focus of&#13;
          The RWSS Sector Strategy was a catalyst for a transition       Nam Saat's work in the RWSS sector is holistic and requires&#13;
          from top-down approaches to bottom-up, demand driven           the presence of the three important components of RWSS Â­&#13;
          methods. Creating demand requires that the process be          hygiene, water and sanitation, as reflected in Nam Saat's&#13;
          community-led and participatory. This approach can carry       sector goals.&#13;
          over into hygiene promotion as well.&#13;

          From experiences in the field, Nam Saat has realized that         in Lao PDR&#13;
          a focus only on technical issues is ineffective for the        While Nam Saat Central oversees hygiene promotion,&#13;

          have a significant impact. Worldwide experiences in the        activities:&#13;
          RWSS sector show that hygiene is a fundamental part of&#13;
          any program. The three parts of the RWSS Program in Lao        Â· Provincial and district staff training on hygiene&#13;
          PDR are: water supply, promotion for latrine construction,         promotion and education methods.&#13;
          and hygiene - all are equally important to achieving Nam       Â· Proper use of water supply and sanitation facilities.&#13;

          The first goal of Nam Saat's RWSS program is to improve            provincial and district levels.&#13;
          access, use and sustainability of new and existing water       Â· Organizing flow of information through regular&#13;

          promotion can be the key to identifying and promoting          Â· Producing materials and manuals for use in the field.&#13;
          motivational factors for local people to operate and&#13;
          maintain their services effectively. Without maintenance,&#13;
          systems will fall into disrepair and, consequently, people&#13;
          will revert to their old risky practices. Thus, hygiene         Together with Nam Saat, the Ministry of Education is&#13;

          1. The insider's, or `emic' view, which comes from the                       from family members. It is important to have a&#13;
              community members themselves; and                                        relationship with the local community before respect can&#13;

              outside the community.                                                   trained hygiene worker, it doesn't mean that everything&#13;

          parents and their ancestors have told them, others on life                   can lead to change faster than the fear of poor health.&#13;

                             Box 2: A Matrix to Facilitate Community Choice for Hygiene Improvement&#13;
                                         Demonstrated and discussed at Sector Forum, Vientiane, January 2001&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           The matrix presented in this box is a key component of the participatory hygiene promotion approach. The activities leading&#13;
           up to the completion of the table below enable local people to identify and prioritize the risky behaviors which will be&#13;
           targeted in a hygiene promotion program. Decisions are made at the village level, and answers come from the people&#13;
           themselves. This method can be done with a few simple steps:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           1. With pictures, using questions and answers, help the group of local people trace the fecal-oral transmission which may&#13;
               happen in their village, using the F-Diagram (feces to fingers, flies, fields, fluids, food to mouth).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      Fingers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        Flies&#13;
                   FECES                                                                   Food                          MOUTH&#13;
                                                       Fields&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       Fluids&#13;
&#13;
           2. Discuss ways to block fecal-oral transmission. Get people to position the blocking methods (people can write, draw or&#13;
               choose symbols to place over the diagram). Collect as many as possible. We now have a list of target behaviors&#13;
               developed by the community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           3. Using a clear space on the ground, have people sort all the blocking methods into "has a big effect", "has a small&#13;
               effect" and "has no effect" on disease transmission. Keep these three piles separate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           4. Keeping the three piles in order, have people sort each pile of blocking methods into "easy to do", "possible to do"&#13;
               and "difficult to do". We have now made up a matrix ranking target behaviors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           5. Plan out the next steps. Communities can draw or use local materials to symbolize the next steps. Who will be&#13;
               responsible for what? Using pictures and symbols helps people see the logical progression to reaching their target.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       Little or No Impact     Medium Impact                Large Impact&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Easy to do&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      These activities&#13;
                                                         Better to avoid                           should be targeted&#13;
&#13;
                                Possible to do           these activities                         first because people&#13;
                                                         since they are                             say they are easy&#13;
                                                        hard to do and                               and have a big&#13;
                                                            have little                            effect for reducing&#13;
                                                              effect.                                    fecal-oral&#13;

          Not only does school sanitation involve teaching students&#13;
          about good hygiene practices, it involves teaching teachers                By using existing structures for training teachers, and&#13;
          as well. The educational approach incorporates hygiene                     institutionalizing hygiene education into the curriculum, this&#13;

          have developed a primary school hygiene program. The                         by the students are used to promote behavior change.&#13;

          Training of teachers has typically been done through the          behavior the most (for example new mothers and their&#13;
          `cascade' approach (where one training workshop is held           husbands). Activities, messages (communications and&#13;
          to train provincial trainers, who will in turn run workshops      advertising) as well as trial behavior change and pilot&#13;
          to train district trainers, who will then organize training       projects will be aimed at the target populations.&#13;

          approach results in the dilution of training effectiveness.       Lao PDR Case study: Luang Namtha and Bokeo&#13;
          Every time a trainee becomes a trainer some of the                Experiences&#13;
          information is lost. To avoid dilution, Nam Saat is thinking&#13;
          about working through local training institutions, which          A provincial team, supported by advisers from an External&#13;
          would provide training directly to teachers. Coordination         Support Agency, started the pilot water supply and&#13;

          A number of partners, led by Central Nam Saat and the             They used digital cameras to capture "a day in the life"&#13;
          Ministry of Health, came together to organize events in           images of village activities in some of the target villages. By&#13;
          commemoration of the World Water Day in Lao PDR on                afternoon, the images were prepared and ready for use in&#13;
          March 2001. Rather than holding informative seminars, the         discussion with the community. The team then used these&#13;
          organizers decided to draw the information from school            "real images" to highlight the existing positive and negative&#13;

          One of the key events leading up to the commemoration&#13;
          was a school drawing and slogan competition. School age             Nam Saat has taken a step further. In some selected&#13;
          children from 36 primary and secondary schools in                   Spearhead provinces, the provincial staff are now well&#13;
          Vientiane competed for the best slogan and drawing. The             skilled to operate their own digital cameras. They are&#13;
          winners of different age categories received prizes and             now planning to use these "a day in the life" images&#13;

          drawing and slogan competitions were based on the `hand             behavior. This process has just been initiated in&#13;

          Option 4a: Participatory Hygiene Promotion                        Social marketing is a method adapted from commercial&#13;
          Facilitators work with groups of local people to identify key     marketing techniques for social goals (improved health).&#13;
          risky behaviors in the community. Communities themselves          Products are "sold" to consumers through heavy promotion&#13;
          are empowered to make decisions about which behavior              (for example promoting soap for hand washing).&#13;
          changes are most important and what methods can be used&#13;
          to change these behaviors. Participatory tools (such as the&#13;
          "fecal-oral route in pictures", "pocket-chart voting" and           Option 4b makes use of "focus group discussions" to&#13;
&#13;
          "story with a gap") are widely used8. By identifying and            find out how people feel about different products and&#13;
&#13;
          prioritizing behaviors themselves, people are then able to          behaviors. Motivations to change (convenience, status,&#13;
&#13;
          come up with solutions appropriate to the local context. The        prestige etc.) are identified by the target group and&#13;
&#13;
          focus of this approach is to facilitate community-level             then    hygiene    behaviors    are    marketed      using&#13;
&#13;
          decisions about which behaviors to target and the method            appropriate motivational messages. An example might&#13;
&#13;
          for change. It is assumed that local people have ideas and          be that people with clean hands are more respected in&#13;
&#13;
          knowledge on how to improve their hygiene behavior with             the village; therefore the message may be "wash your&#13;
&#13;
          the help of a facilitator. Planning is done in the community.       hands for respect of your neighbors". The goal of&#13;
                                                                              social marketing is to "sell" a hygienic behavior to the&#13;
&#13;
          The target group in participatory hygiene promotion is the          "customers". The focus is not on education, but on the&#13;

          group most at risk and the people who influence their               adoption of good practices.&#13;

            Promoting options for cleaner, healthier
            lives : translating sector strategy into better hygiene
            practices in the Lao PDR

        <abstracts>
            The Lao PDR National Center for
            Environmental Health and Water Supply (Nam Saat) devised a
            sector strategy in 1997, paving the way for increased
            hygiene promotion and hygiene education opportunities. In
            the past decade there were many positive developments in the
            RWSS sector in the Lao PDR. However, despite improved
            latrine and water supply coverage, health remains a serious
            problem. The top three causes of mortality among children
            under 5 are malaria, diarrhea and respiratory infections.
            This paper includes the following headings: background to
            hygiene promotion in the Lao PDR; key partners in hygiene
            activities in the Lao PDR; what is hygiene; milestones of
            hygiene in the Lao PDR; hygiene promotion -- the
            insider's and outsider's views; changing beliefs
            -- a challenge indeed; reaching consensus on hygiene
            promotion for the Lao PDR; an overview of hygiene
            promotional materials produced nationally; a matrix to
            facilitate informed choice for hygiene improvement; so what
            is the best way of doing hygiene promotion in the Lao PDR;
            menu of hygiene promotion options at program level;
            snapshots of each option; hygiene options at-a-glance;
            looking to the future; and resources for hygiene promotion information.
