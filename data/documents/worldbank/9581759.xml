&#13;
Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation coverage in Vietnam has risen rapidly over the 14 year period 1990 to 2004: from 36% to 60%. Compared&#13;
to water supply, the sanitation sector is weaker in terms of material facilities and institutions as well as management&#13;
capacity. While poor sanitation and hygiene have a wide variety of negative impacts, the evidence base is weak,&#13;
thus hampering the implementation of much needed investments in the sanitation sector. The urgency for such&#13;
research, and not to mention investments, is only likely to grow over time. One of the reasons is that, with an&#13;
average population growth of more 1.3% per annum, an additional 1 million Vietnamese will require adequate and&#13;
clean sanitation facilities each year. Thus, the "Sanitation Impact"study was initiated by the World Bank to generate&#13;
evidence on the impacts of the existing sanitation situation and potential improvements in sanitation and hygiene&#13;
in Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The study conducted a quantitative assessment of the impacts of poor sanitation on health, water resources,&#13;
environment, tourism and other welfare indicators. The inclusion of health was based on well-established links&#13;
between sanitation and disease incidence. On the other hand, water impacts were deemed important because&#13;
poor sanitation is a significant cause of water pollution. This in turn leads to costly avertive behavior in response&#13;
to less usable water resources. Moreover, pollution also affects the productivity of water resources by way of lower&#13;
output of fisheries. Environment impact cannot be ignored since unimproved sanitation affects the quality of land,&#13;
and renders it unattractive or even unusable for productive use. Other welfare impacts were included because the&#13;
absence of improved sanitation affects people in terms of the time spent accessing facilities, productivity in work&#13;
and school and intangible welfare impacts. Finally, tourism was included in the study because poor sanitation affects&#13;
the country's attractiveness as a tourist destination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The primary focus of this study is on human excreta, while for selected impacts other important components of&#13;
domestic sanitation ­ gray water and solid waste ­ were included. In Vietnam, given that`Sanitation'is more broadly&#13;
defined in the proposal to develop a 'Unified Sanitation Sector Strategy and Action Plan' (U3SAP), some additional&#13;
components of sanitation described in the strategy are included in this present study such as agricultural waste and&#13;
waste water from trade villages. In measuring the impacts, the study used standard peer-reviewed methodologies.&#13;
Financial and economic costs were also distinguished to improve policy interpretation of the results. For selected&#13;
impacts, the analysis was conducted at the regional level and aggregated to national level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This study has found that poor sanitation causes considerable financial and economic losses in Vietnam. Financial&#13;
losses ­ reflecting expenditure or income losses resulting from poor sanitation are equal to roughly 0.5% of annual&#13;
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), while overall population welfare losses are equal to 1.3% of GDP. The majority of&#13;
economic losses are shared between health (34%), water resources (37%) and the environment (15%). The annual&#13;
losses per capita equal US$9.38 or VND 150,770. The diagram below shows the annual losses by impact category.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
               The study estimated the economic losses of health impact to be US$262 million. Health impacts were divided into&#13;
               the costs of health care, productivity and premature death. The study results indicate that sanitation accounts for&#13;
               nearly 7 million diarrhea cases, 2.4 million cases of scabies, helminthes, hepatitis A and trachoma and 0.9 million&#13;
               malnutrition-related cases per annum. These diseases also cause more than 9,000 deaths per year, mostly among&#13;
               children. The health impacts were found to be driven mostly by the costs of premature death and treatment of&#13;
               disease. Of the total health economic costs of US$262 million, health care, productivity costs, and premature death&#13;
               are US$53 million (20%), US$4.6 million (2%) and US$204 million (78%) of the costs, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               A second major impact measured in this study is the impact of poor sanitation on water resources. This study&#13;
               estimates the costs of poor sanitation to be more than US$287 million, including 3 sub-impacts: drinking water,&#13;
               domestic water uses and fisheries. The study shows that economic losses total US$197 for domestic water uses,&#13;
               US$27 million for fisheries and US$63 million for drinking water annually.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               The impacts on the environment were divided into aesthetics and land use, but only the latter was evaluated&#13;
               quantitatively.Thestudyestimatedtheamountoflandthathasbeenrenderedtemporarilyunusableorunproductive&#13;
               for other uses for all unsanitary landfills in Vietnam as a result of unexpected buffer zones. The study estimated that&#13;
               more than US$118 million in the value of land is lost annually.&#13;

               the time it takes for users who share or do not have toilets to access a facility or suitable location. The second - life&#13;
               choices ­ includes days of females absent from school and work places due to poor sanitation. The study found that&#13;
               the cost of sub-optimal access to toilet facilities US$41.6 million per year, while estimates for life choices totaled&#13;
               US$1.3 million per annum. Other`intangible'welfare impacts were not evaluated quantitatively, but are expected to&#13;
               be important, such as loss of comfort, privacy, prestige and status associated with poor sanitation facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Losses to tourism were conservatively estimated to equal US$69 million annually, reflecting lower-than-optimal&#13;
               tourist numbers, part of which is attributed to poor sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               The above impacts are related to lack of access to improved household latrines and household gray water&#13;
               management; for environmental impacts, the estimates include inadequate solid waste management. As a part of&#13;
               the expanded components of sanitation evaluated in Vietnam, water pollution from agricultural waste and trade&#13;
               villages were included, adding an additional US$287 million economic impacts per year. However, this figure reflects&#13;
               only a proportion of the total impacts of agricultural waste and waste from trade villages.&#13;

       Economic Impacts of Sanitation in Vietnam&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                                                                             EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Having estimated the costs of poor sanitation, the study also evaluated the benefits associated with improved&#13;
sanitation and hygiene practices. In this study, five potential improvements were examined. These are (a) better&#13;
hygiene practices, (b) improved latrine physical access, (c) improved toilet system, (d) improved treatment and (e)&#13;
re-use. The results indicate that improvements in treatment or disposal of waste can reduce the losses by US$355&#13;
million a year, mainly through water and tourism impacts. There is also a large benefit arising from the improved&#13;
hygiene through reduced health care costs (US$228 million). The value of sanitation input and output markets are&#13;
estimated at US$129 million and US$202 million, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
While the benefits arising from specific sanitation options will not necessarily lead to gains which are equal to the sum&#13;
of the values above, the results nonetheless suggests that the gains can be significant. Hence the different sanitation&#13;
options need to be examined in terms of what impacts they have, given that single options may simultaneously&#13;
have several or all of the measured benefits. Moreover, the gains are also likely to be larger when one incorporates&#13;
the impacts on related markets..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The findings of this study indicate that poor sanitation has significant economic costs. Consequently, it also showed&#13;
that the gains from improved sanitation can be substantial. On the basis of these findings, the study recommends&#13;
the following.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
First, sanitation`players'are advised to act now, otherwise the negative impacts of poor sanitation will increase over&#13;
time. The government and other stakeholders should jointly reassess the current and planned spending levels in&#13;
the sanitation and related sectors, covering health, water resources, environment, rural and urban planning and&#13;
development, fisheries, and tourism. Increased political importance and budget allocations should be given to&#13;
sanitation. Sanitation decision makers should use an evidence-based approach to design efficient sanitation policies&#13;
and implementation strategies, to increase value-for-money from public and private investments into sanitation..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Second, when financial resources are scarce, the government should give priority to the populations with no&#13;
latrine, recognizing that effective demand may be low in these groups due to low incomes and poor awareness of&#13;
the benefits of investing in sanitation. As well as stimulating demand through public health and latrine advocacy&#13;
messages, the government should target programs, subsidies and financing mechanisms to the most disadvantaged&#13;
population groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Third, players should broaden the scope of sanitation beyond latrines. Sanitation investments should not be made&#13;
just in latrine extension programs, but in improved sludge, water and solid waste management, and in hygiene&#13;
programs to raise population awareness on personal and community hygiene issues. The Unified Sanitation Sector&#13;
Strategy and Action Plan is critical to boosting harmonized sanitation efforts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Fourth, the government should focus on the easy health wins from improved sanitation, through targeting children&#13;
and focusing on safe but simple latrine designs, improved excreta isolation measures, and improved hygiene&#13;
practices. Given the key role of hygiene practices in health improvement, high-impact hygiene components should&#13;
be integrated in the planning and implementation of sanitation programs. The Ministry of Health should (continue&#13;
to) play a central role in the health aspects of sanitation programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To convince local decision makers such as city mayors or district officers to invest in sanitation, local studies would&#13;
be more credible in convincing local decision makers that sanitation is a neglected issue and that significant&#13;
improvements in population welfare can be obtained. The methodology used in this study can be equally applied&#13;
to local micro-level studies as well as the national level. Furthermore, local as well as national decision makers need&#13;
to be informed of the efficiency of different measures to improve sanitation. Local level cost-benefit studies inform&#13;
national decision makers how to invest efficiently in sanitation.&#13;

FOREWORD&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Foreword&#13;
&#13;
              Vietnam, like other countries of Southeast and East Asia, is on a development path that is lifting large numbers of&#13;
              people out of poverty and improving access to goods and services that improve quality of life. While Vietnam has&#13;
              done well so far in achieving socio-economic development, some aspects of development are being forgotten&#13;
              in the race to economic progress. Also, the development process itself jeopardizes the quality of life of its citizens,&#13;
              especially vulnerable and low income groups, which in turn has unrecognized negative economic impacts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Sanitation is one such neglected aspect of development. Among the many priorities of households as well as the&#13;
              government, it is often pushed down the agenda, and left as an issue to be dealt with by someone else, or not at all.&#13;
              Though sanitation coverage in Vietnam rose rapidly over the last 15 years, the sanitation sector is weaker than the&#13;
              water sector in terms of material facilities, institutions and management capacity. On current projections, the 2015&#13;
              Millennium Development Goal (MDGs) sanitation target and Vietnam' own goals, the 2010 Vietnam Development&#13;
              Goals (VDGs), need considerable further investment to meet. Given that `Sanitation' in Vietnam is more broadly&#13;
              defined in the proposal to develop a"Unified Sanitation Sector Strategy and Action Plan", boosting sanitation efforts&#13;
              and approaches is even more urgent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              To control and mitigate these direct impacts and externalities requires increased investment in sanitation as well as&#13;
              in improved knowledge, understanding and behavioral change, regulation and monitoring to maintain standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Hence, if all stakeholders are to be convinced that these expenditures are worth making, evidence is needed to&#13;
              better understand the impacts of poor sanitation now and in the future, and to detail the expected benefits from&#13;
              different sanitation choices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Based on this premise, the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) in East Asia and the Pacific (WSP-EAP)&#13;
              is supporting the development of a research program "the Economics of Sanitation Initiative" (ESI) to generate&#13;
              evidence on the economic costs and benefits of different sanitation-related options.The research under this program&#13;
              is initially being conducted in Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              The first major activity of the Economics of Sanitation Initiative is to conduct a`Sanitation Impact Study', to examine&#13;
              the economic and social impacts of unimproved sanitation to the population and economy of Vietnam, as well&#13;
              as the potential benefits of improving sanitation. They will be further supported in decision making following the&#13;
              completion of the second study of ESI, a `Sanitation Options Study', which will examine the cost-effectiveness and&#13;
              cost-benefit of alternative sanitation improvement, financing and management options in a range of settings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              While the Water and Sanitation Program has supported the development of this program, it is an `initiative' in the&#13;
              broadest sense, one in which many people and institutions have become involved and have actively contributed&#13;
              (see`Acknowledgements'section and Annex C for details), with a high sense of country and regional ownership.&#13;

             The Sanitation Impact Study was conducted in four countries: Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam.&#13;
             A study is ongoing in Lao PDR. The study was led by the East Asia and Pacific office of the World Bank's Water and&#13;
             Sanitation Program (WSP), with the contribution of WSP teams in each of the participating countries. The study took&#13;
             one year to complete, and has undergone two major peer review processes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Guy Hutton (WSP-EAP Regional Senior Water and Sanitation Economist) led the development of the concept and&#13;
             methodology for the Economics of Sanitation Initiative, and the management and coordination of the country&#13;
             team. The study benefited from the continuous support of other WSP-EAP staff. Isabel Blackett was the Task Team&#13;
             Leader; and Jema Sy, Brian Smith, Almud Weitz and Richard Pollard provided input to the concept development and&#13;
             study execution. Bjorn Larsen (WSP Consultant) contributed to the study methodology and provided the figures for&#13;
             malnutrition-related health effects of poor sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             The country team in Vietnam consisted of Pham Ngoc Thang (WSP Consultant and country lead) and Hoang Anh&#13;
             Tuan (WSP Consultant). WSP staff in Vietnam country office provided valuable management, technical support and&#13;
             peer review: Nguyen Thanh, Mike Seager, Nguyen Diem Hang and Nga Kim Nguyen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             The ESI has been financed by the regional component of the Sustainable Sanitation in East Asia (SUSEA) program,&#13;
             which is funded by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA). The Philippines study received co-&#13;
             funding from the USAID Environmental Cooperation-Asia (ECO-Asia) program. WSP and the report authors are&#13;
             grateful to the funding agencies for supporting this study.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              1.1 Human development and sanitation&#13;
&#13;
              Pollution caused by human activity is not a new issue or problem ­ it has been around as long as man himself.&#13;
              However, as human populations have become more concentrated and located in vulnerable land or coastal areas,&#13;
              the ability of man to pollute has increased substantially. A major cause of pollution is due to waste products, including&#13;
              waste from human living activities, industrial and agricultural waste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Like other Asian countries, Vietnam faces severe population pressures, with high population density, especially in&#13;
              coastal areas. Environmental concerns and economic development are not aligned towards sustainable growth. Of&#13;
              122 countries evaluated for environmental sustainability,Vietnam ranked at 114th, and with respect to environmental&#13;
              systems1, Vietnam ranked at 108th [1]. Vietnam along with other Southeast Asian countries is reported to have the&#13;
              worst water pollution, with "very severe" ranking for fecal coliforms, biochemical oxygen demand and lead, and&#13;
              severe for suspended solids [2]. The quality of water bodies is being increasing polluted as a result of economic&#13;
              development and lack of proper disposal or treatment of sewage and wastewater, and many rivers reaching severe&#13;
              levels of water pollution [3].Water pollution and water-borne diseases remain key issues inVietnam, with inadequate&#13;
              water supply and sanitation listed as major causes. Indeed, severe disease and premature mortality are some of the&#13;
              most direct and devastating impacts of poor sanitation and hygiene, with the poor, children and women affected&#13;
              disproportionately.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              1.2 Sanitation in Vietnam&#13;
&#13;
              Unarguably, sanitation is lagging behind other global development goals. In 2004, 59% of the world's population&#13;
              had access to improved sanitation, which represents a 10% increase from 49% global coverage in 1990. However,&#13;
              due to population growth, the unserved global population has decreased only marginally from 2.7 to 2.6 billion&#13;
              over a 14 year time period [4]. Official sanitation coverage data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program&#13;
              (JMP) are tabulated below for Southeast Asian countries, and for other world regions, comparing the MDG base&#13;
              year (1990) with the most recent coverage data (2004). Annex Table D1 provides JMP definitions of improved and&#13;
              unimproved water and sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Based on JMP statistics for 2004 Vietnam has the best access statistics for urban sanitation of all the lower income&#13;
              countries in the region, although this does not reflect adequate treatment and disposal of wastes. All the middle&#13;
              and high income countries in the region, such as Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia, have higher coverage figures.&#13;
              Despite an impressive growth in sanitation coverage of more than 60% since 1990, only 50% of rural households&#13;
              have access to improved sanitation in the year 2004.&#13;

Table 2 presents data in chronological order from four major national surveys in Vietnam (Demographic &amp; Health&#13;
Survey, Vietnam National Health Survey, Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey, and World Health Survey),&#13;
compared with JMP statistics for 2002 and 2004.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
According to GSO VHLSS [5], urban and rural access to and sanitation in 2004 is 89% and 50%, respectively, with&#13;
overall access of 61%. However other studies indicate lower levels of access. For example, the Vietnam MDG Report&#13;
from 2004 shows figures for urban and rural sanitation at 68% and 11.5%, respectively, with overall access of 25%.&#13;
WHO-UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) shows that urban and rural access to sanitation in 2002 is 84%&#13;
and 26%, respectively [6]. It is important to note the difference in the definition of improved sanitation between&#13;
internationally-cited JMP statistics (see Annex Table D1) and national statistics. The JMP defines improved sanitation&#13;
as the proportion of the population that has access to house connections (sewers), septic tanks, and improved pit&#13;
latrines. According to JMP, unimproved sanitation includes public toilets, pit latrines, open defecation and other&#13;
facilities, while the Vietnam General Statistics Office (GSO) classifies different types of toilet facility, but without&#13;
distinguishing between improved and unimproved [5].&#13;

              In addition, there are considerable disparities in sanitation coverage between different regions. In general, sanitation&#13;
              coverage in the North West, the Central Highlands and the Mekong River Delta are much lower than in the rest of&#13;
              the country. The coverage in those regions is 22.8%, 42.9% and 31.4% respectively. Annex Table D2 provides further&#13;
              information on sanitation coverage in different regions of Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              In terms of other aspects of sanitation, there are fewer data available. One aspect where there are data, solid waste&#13;
              management, indicates relatively poor sanitation levels in Vietnam. Only 60% of solid waste from urban areas&#13;
              and industrial zones is collected and disposed of in dumpsites, and only 12 out of 61 cities and provincial capitals&#13;
              have engineered or sanitary landfills [7]. Data on solid waste disposal practices of households reveal only 22% of&#13;
              households have their solid waste collected by garbage truck, with over 50% of households burning their rubbish,&#13;
              20% burying it, and 13% throwing into a river [8].&#13;

&#13;
The coverage of sewerage and drainage services in urban areas is estimated to be about 40-50% (from 0% in some&#13;
small towns to 70% in some big cities) [9]. In addition, agricultural waste is also a growing problem. Agricultural&#13;
chemicals are used by a high proportion of farners, covering large areas of land. As a result, many contaminants from&#13;
agricultural land (mud, alum, fertilizer, pesticide, etc.) have been carried to water sources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Duringthelastdecade,theGovernmentandthedonorcommunityhavefocusedmainlyonimprovingaccesstowater&#13;
supply. The sanitation sector has been given greater attention in recent years due to the fact that wastewater and&#13;
solid waste are becoming urgent issues in urban areas, industrial zones, and trade villages as a result of urbanization&#13;
and industrialization processes. In general, in comparison with water supply, the sanitation sector is weaker in terms&#13;
of material facilities and institutional support, as well as institutional implementation capacity. Current trends shows&#13;
that it remains difficult to meet the sanitation MDG sanitation target in Vietnam, and the development goals of the&#13;
Vietnam government (VDGs) [9].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition to excreta, urban areas and industrial zones in Vietnam generate some 20,000 tons of solid waste every&#13;
day of which only 60% is collected and disposed of. In big cities, the problem related to the landfills ­ which are&#13;
often little more than open dumping ground ­ also needs to be urgently and properly dealt with to avoid protests&#13;
raised by the local residents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There are about 1,450 cottage/trade villages in Vietnam, which are concentrated in Red River Delta (67.3%), central&#13;
area (20.5%) and southern area (12.2%) [10]. Vietnamese trade villages can be divided into: agricultural product&#13;
processing villages, weaving and dying villages, fine arts and craft villages, recycling villages, construction material&#13;
villages and other professional villages.These cottage villages generate a substantial amount of solid waste from their&#13;
production activities. Annex Table D13 provides further information on numbers of cottage villages in Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
According to current estimates, the government targets for service provision by 2010, which reflect the MDGs on&#13;
water supply and sanitation, will require investment in the order of US$8.8 billion [6]. Sanitation requires US$4.2 of&#13;
this total, US$3.8 billion in urban areas and US$0.4 billion in rural areas. If the budget contribution to urban water&#13;
supply and sanitation remains at the level of the last 10 years, this source will be able to finance only about 4% of&#13;
urban needs during 2004-2010. With respect to rural water supply and sanitation, according to the NRWSSS, users&#13;
are responsible for all the investment and operation and maintenance costs of the rural water supply and sanitation&#13;
facilities, with government grants supporting only the poor. With the current mix of overseas development aid and&#13;
government funds, around 25% of urban and rural needs can be funded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The reasons for public underinvestment in sanitation in Vietnam are many, and include the low political profile of&#13;
sanitation in terms of government prioritization and funding, limited tax revenue, the lack of recognition of the&#13;
many costs to society of poor sanitation, and a higher demand for investments in domestic water supply. As well&#13;
as lack of top-down investment in the sector, the opportunities for attracting private sector engagement in the&#13;
financing and provision of sanitation services are not sufficiently enabled, especially the potential for contribution&#13;
by small-scale entrepreneurs. To date, most sanitation investment has been by household self-provision. Sanitation&#13;
in Vietnam is predominantly a private good with the majority of households investing in septic tanks or latrines. The&#13;
financing source in rural areas has been predominantly community and household contributions, whereas public&#13;
investment is mainly in the big cities.&#13;

              As a result, this sanitation impact study is important for a number of reasons. First, this is the first attempt to measure&#13;
              the real impacts of poor sanitation in Vietnam. Second, the results of the study can be used to raise the awareness of&#13;
              all stakeholders, including government, private sector and donor agencies with regards to the urgency of boosting&#13;
              sanitation efforts and approaches. Finally, this study will hopefully stimulate further research in the area.&#13;

              Until now, many of the consequences of poor sanitation are understood at a general level, but few impact-specific&#13;
              and location-specific data exists to support assertions that poor sanitation imposes a considerable burden on&#13;
              society. Without such information, policy makers are unable to act. Furthermore, while some impacts of sanitation&#13;
              are now better understood, such as health impacts, many of the stakeholders that need to become convinced of&#13;
              the importance of sanitation are not directly concerned with health. Hence a range of potential impacts need to&#13;
              be examined and presented so that stakeholders see the multiple negative impacts of sanitation, and thus become&#13;
              convinced that concerted action is needed from several sectors. This sub-section seeks to briefly elaborate some of&#13;
              the economic impacts associated with poor sanitation, and on the other side of the coin, some economic benefits&#13;
              associated with improved sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              1. Population health&#13;
              One of the major arguments commonly used for improving sanitation is reduction in disease incidence, and the&#13;
              various health-related benefits. There are many diseases associated with poor sanitation and hygiene practices,&#13;
              among them diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, salmonellosis, shigellosis, typhoid fever, hepatitis A, trachoma, and some&#13;
              parasitic diseases (ascariasis, trichuriasis, hookworm, schistosomiasis). Disease and poverty are linked in a vicious&#13;
              circle, and hence disease reduction can lift populations out of poverty, or prevent them from falling into poverty&#13;
              [11]. Less disease means less treatment seeking costs as well as a gain in healthy time, leading to more time for&#13;
              productive or leisure activities, which have a direct welfare impact [12, 13]. When productive time gained leads to a&#13;
              net increase in economic activities, it can contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction. Disease reduction&#13;
              also leads to savings for society, such as health care and other state benefits for chronic sufferers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              2. Water resources&#13;
              The 2003 United Nations Report "Water for people, Water for life" states that many rivers, lakes and groundwater&#13;
              resources are becoming increasingly polluted, and that human waste is one of the most frequent sources of pollution&#13;
              [14]. In Southeast Asian countries, a significant proportion of human waste is flushed directly into water resources&#13;
              due to low coverage of sewage treatment for piped sewerage, or else human waste eventually finds its way into&#13;
              water resources through open defecation, leaking septic tanks or seepage from pit latrines. As a result, levels of&#13;
              suspended solids in rivers in Asia have risen by a factor of four over the last three decades and Asian rivers have a&#13;
              higher biological oxygen demand and bacterial content than the global average [14]. The results of polluted water&#13;
              on human activity are many: previously safe drinking water sources are rendered unusable, and water becomes&#13;
              less productive or usable for agricultural uses including fish production, for industrial as well as for domestic uses.&#13;
              According to the Asian Development Bank, the threat to fish production is especially important, given the economic&#13;
              importance, subsistence value as well as nutritional value of fish in the Southeast Asian region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              3. Environment&#13;
              The release of human waste into the environment has other effects besides water pollution, given the smells&#13;
              emanating from feces and urine, the widespread wish to avoid it, and the associated degradation of land where&#13;
              human waste accumulates. As well as human waste as a source of pollution, another major source of environmental&#13;
              pollution is that of solid waste. The use of open land as a public toilet and open garbage dump affects the quality of&#13;
              land,andrendersitunattractiveorevenunusableforproductiveuse.EveninEastAsiancountrieswheremunicipalities&#13;
              are responsible for collecting solid waste, solid waste collection is not commonly done, or inadequately done.&#13;
              Households and often the commercial sector respond by managing waste disposal themselves, and thus solid waste&#13;
              is commonly disposed of in the street or in other unofficial dumping grounds which are not managed properly.&#13;

      Economic Impacts of Sanitation in Vietnam&#13;
20    A five-country study conducted in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines and Vietnam under the Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI)&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                  INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This presents a threat to those disposing of waste as well as those living in the vicinity of the dumping area. Waste&#13;
grounds are inhabited by stray dogs, rats or other animals, which are diseased and pose a threat to human health.&#13;
Even where there is a private or public agency taking care of disposal, it is often not performed according to plan. In&#13;
cities, waste carts stay on the streets for many days, with resulting smell and unsightliness for local inhabitants and&#13;
tourists.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. User preferences&#13;
Lack of or poor sanitation facilities has implications for access time and convenience related to toilet-going, which&#13;
have a number of direct as well as indirect welfare effects. Intangible welfare effects related to the comfort and privacy&#13;
of having a private and clean place to meet toilet needs is an often underrated negative impact of unimproved&#13;
sanitation. Also, closer sanitation facilities in the home or compound leads to time savings for those who previously&#13;
regularly accessed public latrines or an isolated spot in the open field or bush [15]. Time savings can be used for&#13;
other productive or leisure activities, and thus have an economic value. Furthermore, the presence of improved&#13;
sanitation facilities in educational establishments has shown to affect the rate of school attendance, especially for&#13;
girls [16]. This effect may also be present in workplaces, where women's ability to participate in the labor force is&#13;
reduced due to poor conditions of toilets and no separate female toilet options.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Earnings from tourism and foreign direct investment&#13;
Tourists are sensitive to their environment, and are less likely to choose destinations which are dirty or where the risk&#13;
of disease is high. Countries may be losing tourist revenues due to the degraded environment and high infectious&#13;
disease rates among the general population, as well as actual or perceived health risks to tourists. Hence any initiative&#13;
to attract more tourists to a country will need to consider the part sanitation plays in this [17-19]. Likewise, foreign&#13;
companies may also take into account the general environmental conditions and health of the local workforce in&#13;
making location decisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6. Opportunities for use of outputs of sanitation&#13;
Where human waste is used as fertilizer and soil conditioner, the availability of nutrients from human excreta can&#13;
lead to the replacement of chemical fertilizer, which saves costs. Furthermore, where fertilizer was not being used&#13;
optimally before, the nutritional content and economic value of crops may increase. Also, there are long-term&#13;
benefits of reducing the use of chemical and mineral fertilizers, especially taking into account the fact that some&#13;
fossil resources are in increasingly short supply (e.g. phosphorous). Alternatively, families with livestock may instead&#13;
invest in a biogas reactor, which provides biofuel for cooking, space heating and can even be used for lighting where&#13;
other improved sources (electricity) are not available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7. Stimulus to the local economy of sanitation input markets&#13;
Given the needs of sanitation programs for human labor and materials, sanitation programs will have a number&#13;
of economic effects at local level. Economic impacts ­ revenue, employment and profit ­ and with effects up the&#13;
supply chain, will be for small local entrepreneurs as well as larger, non-local companies. There is also a potential for&#13;
improving livelihoods of poor people, largely through health improvement and employment generation [20].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8. Macroeconomic effect and overall economic growth&#13;
Economic growth results from the combination of many of the benefits listed above. The main effects are likely to&#13;
be through lower disease rates, increased time availability, easier access to and reduced treatment of suitable water&#13;
sources for domestic, agricultural and industrial use, and more tourism and foreign direct investment.The production&#13;
and sale of sanitation options can also give a stimulus to the local economy through local employment; and re-use&#13;
of human (and animal waste) can lead to cost savings and higher productivity at household level. Property prices&#13;
also may rise due to better living standards brought by improved sanitation. However, the overall effects on the&#13;
economy such as GDP growth are highly uncertain.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              1.4 Study aims&#13;
&#13;
              The goal of the Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI) is to provide decision makers in Vietnam with evidence for&#13;
              making more informed decisions on sanitation. The target audience is primarily national level policy makers with&#13;
              influence the overall allocation of resources to sanitation, including central ministries (Ministry of Planning and&#13;
              Investment, Ministry of Finance), line ministries (MOC, MARD, MONRE, MOH) and external funding and technical&#13;
              partners (multilateral, bilateral and non-government agencies). The study disaggregates impacts by regional&#13;
              groupings for Vietnam, as well as providing a rural-urban breakdown. However, to inform local decisions, further&#13;
              studies are needed that disaggregate at provincial, city, and district levels, and below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              ESI is organized into two main overlapping studies:&#13;
&#13;
                     1. `Sanitation Impact'study.&#13;
&#13;
                     2. `Sanitation Options'study&#13;
&#13;
              The primary aim of the current `SanitationImpact' study is to generate evidence on the negative impacts of existing&#13;
              sanitation coverage levels and hygiene practices at national level for five countries: Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR,&#13;
              Philippines and Vietnam. The study uses information collected from government and donor statistics and reports,&#13;
              and from the scientific literature, to present a selected range of impacts associated with poor sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
              Results are presented at national level as well as sub-national level for the most recent year for which complete&#13;
              data are available, being 2005. Costs are distinguished according to whether they are financial or economic, and are&#13;
              disaggregated by different impacts and key population groups such as children and women. Separate reports and&#13;
              policy briefs have been produced for each country (www.wsp.org/pubs/index.asp).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Once the Sanitation Impact study is published and disseminated, and the results discussed among sector partners,&#13;
              they will need to know exactly how to act. Decision makers will need to know which sanitation improvements&#13;
              provide the best value for money, what the overall costs and benefits are, and who is willing or able to finance the&#13;
              improvements. Hence a second `Sanitation Options' study is planned to measure and compare the different costs&#13;
              and benefits of alternative sanitation options, and present them in different forms to promote and enable rational&#13;
              decision making by a range of actors (e.g. national and local governments, donors, private companies, NGOs,&#13;
              communities, and households). This second study will select specific contexts where sanitation improvements are&#13;
              being made, and measure the specific costs and benefits in each context where the study is conducted of a range&#13;
              of relevant water and sanitation improvements.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
OVERVIEW OF STUDY METHODOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               The five country Sanitation Impact studies all followed a standardized peer reviewed methodology [21]. Differences&#13;
               in the quality and level of detail of data in the five countries required adaptations to the methodology to arrive&#13;
               at the same output data on economic impacts. However, the findings of the five country studies are still largely&#13;
               comparable [22].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               This section describes:&#13;
               1. The levels and units of analysis (2.1).&#13;
               2. Which aspects of`sanitation'are included in this study (2.2).&#13;
               3. How impacts are classified and which are included and excluded in the study (2.3).&#13;
               4. An overview of how the different economic impacts of unimproved sanitation are measured (2.4).&#13;
               5. The methods used for predicting the economic benefits associated with improved sanitation (`Impact&#13;
                      mitigation') (2.5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Annex A describes the detailed methods for estimating the economic impacts of unimproved sanitation, and how&#13;
               methodological weaknesses and uncertainty in input variables are evaluated in sensitivity analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               2.1 Levels and units of analysis&#13;
&#13;
               The primary aim of this study is to describe and quantify sanitation impacts at national level, in order to inform policy&#13;
               makers about the overall negative impacts of poor sanitation and the potential benefits of implementing different&#13;
               types of sanitation improvement. The ultimate usefulness of these overall economic impacts of poor sanitation&#13;
               is to serve as the basis for estimation of what impacts can be mitigated from improving sanitation. It is key to&#13;
               note in the interpretation of the results of this study that the gains from improving sanitation will be less than the&#13;
               losses from unimproved sanitation, given that (a) sanitation interventions do not have 100% effectiveness to reduce&#13;
               adverse health outcomes associated with poor sanitation, (b) poor sanitation is one of many causes of water and&#13;
               environmental pollution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               The aim of the study is to present impacts in disaggregated form, to aid interpretation and eventually policy&#13;
               recommendations. Geographical disaggregation of results is presented for some types of economic impact at the&#13;
               regional level. Rural/urban disaggregations are made for impacts where feasible. Furthermore, health impacts are&#13;
               disaggregated by age groups for selected diseases and descriptive gender analyses are conducted for selected&#13;
               impacts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               The study uses a modeling approach and draws almost exclusively on secondary sources of data.The study presents&#13;
               impacts in terms of both physical units, and converts these to monetary equivalents using conventional economic&#13;
               valuation techniques. Results on economic impact are presented for a single year ­ the latest available data were&#13;
               for 2005 for most variables, while for some variables 2006 was the latest year. Overall impacts are presented in terms&#13;
               of per capita impacts in United States Dollars. Results are also presented in international dollars2 (I$) to enable cross&#13;
               country comparisons of the relative impact of poor sanitation. For those impacts where quantification in economic&#13;
               terms is not feasible using secondary data sources, the impacts are examined and reported descriptively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Table 4 below shows the population size and provincial make-up of each region of Vietnam. It indicates that about&#13;
               73% of the population inVietnam is concentrated in rural areas.The urbanization rate ofVietnam is lower than that in&#13;
               other South East Asian countries, but still equates to approximately 1 million people officially recognized as moving&#13;
               to urban areas each year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               2    International dollars (I$) take into account the different value of the United States Dollar in each country, by comparing the price of a pre-&#13;
                    defined bundle of goods in each country to a reference country, the United States.&#13;

2.2 Scope of sanitation&#13;
&#13;
Inconductinganimpactstudyofpoorsanitation,itshouldbeclearwhataspectsofsanitationarebeingassessedgiven&#13;
that`sanitation'has relevance for many aspects of life. Furthermore, what actually constitutes improved sanitation will&#13;
vary across countries and cultural contexts. In the international arena, the sanitation target adopted as part of the&#13;
Millennium Development Goals focuses on the disposal of human waste, thus leading to a narrower understanding&#13;
of the term `sanitation'. However, this present study recognizes that other aspects of sanitation are relevant to the&#13;
impacts being measured in the present study, especially in Vietnam, where a broader definition is gaining ground.&#13;
Hence, while the primary focus of this study is on human waste aspects, other important components of domestic&#13;
sanitation ­ gray water and solid waste - have been included. For some impacts, the implications of animal waste&#13;
and other agricultural waste and waste of small scale cottage industry are also evaluated. In addition, the health&#13;
implications of poor hygiene as they relate to human waste are assessed. In Vietnam, `Sanitation' is more broadly&#13;
defined in the proposal to develop a "Unified Sanitation Sector Strategy and Action Plan", with preliminary support&#13;
from all major stakeholders in the sector. Therefore, in addition to the standardized components for the five-country&#13;
study, some additional components of sanitation described in the strategy are included for the first phase of this&#13;
present study: (1) agricultural waste and (2) trade villages. Agricultural waste includes animal waste, crop waste,&#13;
and fertilizer. Pesticides, an important part of agricultural wastes and a cause of major negative health impacts like&#13;
cancer, will be analyzed in later stages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
While it is understood that sanitation in Vietnam is more often even more broadly defined than the components&#13;
listed above, it was not possible to apply a comprehensive definition in this present study due to time and resource&#13;
constraints. Hence, issues such as storm water and drainage, flood control measures, hospital waste, large-scale&#13;
industrial waste, and broader environmental health such as food hygiene, air pollution and vector control, were not&#13;
included. Table 5 summarizes the aspects of sanitation included and excluded from this study.&#13;

               2.3 Impact identification and classification&#13;
&#13;
               Poor sanitation has many actual or potential adverse effects on populations as well as national economies.&#13;
               Conversely, measures for improving sanitation mitigate those negative impacts, hence stimulating economic growth&#13;
               and reducing poverty. Several impacts were introduced briefly in Chapter 1. Figure 1 presents a range of possible&#13;
               impacts of sanitation, as they relate to five key aspects of human excreta management: latrine access, latrine system,&#13;
               hygiene practices, waste disposal, and waste re-use. The major links are shown with arrows.&#13;

&#13;
Based on the exhaustive set of impacts shown in Figure 1, a shortened list of negative impacts of poor sanitation to be&#13;
included in the present study was selected, shown inTable 6.These impacts are classified under five main categories:&#13;
health impacts, water resource impacts, environmental impacts, user preference impacts, and tourism impacts.&#13;
Table 6 also provides further justification for inclusion of these impacts in the study, showing the presumptions&#13;
based on preliminary evidence of importance [24] and discussion with country partners. Annex A provides further&#13;
background on these impact categories.&#13;

&#13;
               saving entry fee which is related to public toilet users, house price rises due to improved sanitation, and foreign direct&#13;
               investment were not examined in this present study, either due to anticipated low importance or data limitations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Table 7 details the sub-impacts examined under health, water resources, external environment, user preferences&#13;
               and tourism. The columns indicate the five key components of sanitation assessed (refer to Table 6) for the different&#13;
               impacts. Human excreta management is relevant for all impact areas. Poor hygiene mainly affects health. Gray water&#13;
               and animal excreta mainly affect water resources. Solid waste mainly affects mainly health, water resources, the&#13;
               external environment and tourism (not all of these are evaluated due to lack of data). Also, potential impacts of&#13;
               improved sanitation ­ the stimulation of local markets for sanitation inputs (labor, materials) and the reuse of waste&#13;
               for productive purposes ­ are also included in Table 7. In Vietnam, additionally storm water, agricultural waste and&#13;
               waste from small commercial enterprises were assessed for their impact on water resources only.&#13;

               2.4 Estimation methods for financial and economic costs of poor sanitation&#13;
&#13;
               Policy makers are interested to understand the nature of the economic impacts being measured. For example, do&#13;
               the impacts have immediate implications for expenditure and incomes by households or governments, or are the&#13;
               effects non-pecuniary or longer-term in nature? The answer will naturally affect how the results are interpreted,&#13;
               and what level of support there will be for impact mitigation measures. Hence, while recognizing the difficulties in&#13;
               distinguishing different types of economic impact, this present study attempts to distinguish broadly between two&#13;
               different types of impact ­ financial and economic:&#13;
&#13;
               · Under financial costs, those costs which are most likely to affect quantified indicators of economic activity&#13;
                      in the short term were included. Financial costs include changes in household and government spending as&#13;
                      well as impacts likely to have real income losses for households (e.g. health-related time loss with impact on&#13;

    economic activity indicators in the short term, these impacts are not expected to directly affect Gross Domestic&#13;

    financial implications (value of loss of life, time use of adults and children, intangible impacts).&#13;

Table 8 describes which cost components were included for financial and economic definitions of cost for each sub-&#13;
impact. It should be noted that costs were those attributed to poor sanitation using an attribution factor (variable&#13;
by impact). Some costs were non-quantified, as indicated in Table 12. The detailed methods of impact estimation&#13;

2.5 Impact mitigation&#13;
&#13;
Having estimated the financial and economic costs of poor sanitation, from a policy viewpoint it is important to&#13;
know by how much these costs can be reduced by implementing improved sanitation options. Indeed, while this&#13;
study initially presents total costs attributed to poor sanitation, it is unlikely that this total value can be averted by&#13;
improving sanitation.&#13;

OVERVIEW OF STUDY METHODOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               While there are many types and configurations of sanitation improvement available, this present study aims to&#13;
               estimate potential benefits obtainable for a selected number of features of sanitation improvements. This study&#13;
               provides an initial tentative estimate of the likely gains possible from improving sanitation using different options. It&#13;
               is the aim of the second study of ESI to estimate the costs and benefits of specific sanitation options, which are the&#13;
               most relevant policy options in each country context.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Table 9 shows the five main features of sanitation improvement (in columns) assessed in this study, and the&#13;
               relevance of these for each sub-impact category (in rows). The features are described in the table footnotes. The&#13;
               impact mitigation estimation methods are described in Annex A6.&#13;

               2.6 Uncertainty&#13;
&#13;
               This study has faced several challenges in attempting to both meet scientific criteria and present evidence that is&#13;
               useful for national as well as local policy makers. In order to provide timely evidence on sanitation impact, the present&#13;
               study is based on entirely secondary information collected from a variety of sources, and combined with assumptions&#13;
               where necessary input data were missing. Therefore, in order to fill the gaps in evidence, several innovative and not&#13;
               previously tested methodologies were developed for this present study. Quantitative information were combined&#13;
               using the methodology outlined above and in Annex A to estimate the impacts of poor sanitation and the potential&#13;
               benefits of improving sanitation. A number of impacts were excluded from quantitative estimation, which are&#13;
               described in Table 12. Three major types of uncertainty surround the quantitative figures presented in this study:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(1)    Uncertainty in the input values for the estimation of overall economic impacts, such as in the epidemiological&#13;
       variables (for health) and economic variables such as market prices and economic values. In fact, there is a&#13;
       severe lack of data available from routine information systems or research studies to feed into the quantitative&#13;
       model. Hence, in the absence of these data, relationships were modeled and assumptions made.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(2)    Uncertainty in the attribution of the overall impact to poor sanitation. For example, when there are multiple&#13;
       sources of pollution, a portion of the overall economic impact estimated must be apportioned to the&#13;
       component of pollution being examined (e.g. domestic waste contribution to overall water pollution). A&#13;
       second example is the importance of poor sanitation in keeping away tourists from a country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(3)    Uncertainty in the actual size of impact mitigation achievable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The variables with greatest importance for the quantitative results were evaluated further in one-way sensitivity&#13;
analysis by varying a single input value over a reasonable range, to assess the impact on overall findings. Alternative&#13;
values used in the sensitivity analysis are provided in Annex A7.&#13;

              3.1 Summary of economic impacts of poor sanitation&#13;
&#13;
              3.1.1 Overall impacts&#13;
&#13;
              This study has found that poor sanitation causes considerable financial and economic losses in Vietnam. Financial&#13;
              losses ­ reflecting expenditure or income losses resulting from poor sanitation average 0.5% of annual GDP, while&#13;
              overall population welfare losses average 1.3% of GDP. The majority of economic losses are shared between health&#13;
              (34%) and water resources (37%), and environment (15%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Table 10 summarizes the economic impacts of poor sanitation. It shows that the estimated overall annual economic&#13;
              losses from poor sanitation are US$780 million.The results indicate that most of the economic losses are explained by&#13;
              water costs (37%), followed by health impacts (34%). The costs on environment, tourism, and other welfare impacts&#13;
              contribute 15%, 9% and 6% to overall economic losses, respectively.The annual losses per capita are US$9.38 or VND&#13;
              150,770.&#13;

majority of assigned impacts are in rural areas (49.1%), due largely to the significantly greater rural populations.&#13;
Considerable shares of total impact (27.5%) could not be assigned due to lack of input data disaggregated by rural-&#13;
urban setting for land loss, fish losses and losses to tourism.&#13;

3.1.2 Other non-quantified impacts of poor sanitation&#13;
&#13;
As well as quantified, monetized impacts, there are a number of other key impacts which have not been valued&#13;
in this present study, and which should be taken into account in interpreting the quantitative impacts discussed&#13;
above. These non-monetized impacts include suffering from disease, intangible aspects of environmental impacts&#13;
(aesthetics) and user preference, time loss from seeking private place for urination (especially women), loss from&#13;
marine fisheries, the non-use value of clean water resources such as`existence'and`bequest'values, and the losses to&#13;
wildlife from polluted water resources and an unclean environment. Other impacts with less clear linkages with poor&#13;
sanitation include the use of water for irrigation purposes and hence agricultural productivity, the impact of poor&#13;
sanitation on foreign direct investment, and impact of unimproved sanitation (and running water) in institutions&#13;
which affect life decisions of the population, especially the decision of women to take employment and of girls&#13;
to enroll in or complete school. Table 12 shows a longer listing of excluded impacts of poor sanitation from the&#13;
quantitative analysis, and elaborates on the likely links to sanitation.&#13;

                                                    2. Macroeconomic impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Together, the quantified and non-quantified financial and economic losses will affect the overall economic situation&#13;
in a country, including economic growth. The main effects are likely to be through sickness time and income loss&#13;
associated with premature death, and household expenditure on health care and clean water, including water&#13;
treatment. The production and sale of sanitation options can also give a stimulus to the local economy through&#13;
local employment. The re-use of human (and animal) excreta can lead to cost savings and enhanced household&#13;
and farmer production. Property prices also may rise due to better living standards brought by improved sanitation.&#13;
However, given the weak empirical evidence on the direct economic effects of improved sanitation, this study&#13;
did not move beyond a partial equilibrium analysis to examine redistributive effects. Therefore, the empirical link&#13;
between poor sanitation and macro-economic indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) is still not known.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.2 Health impacts&#13;
&#13;
Table 13 reports the estimated cases and deaths per year from selected diseases which are attributable to poor&#13;
sanitation. It shows that diarrhea has the most number of cases at 7.05 million. Diarrhea is also the main cause&#13;
of death from poor sanitation and hygiene, accounting for 4,576 deaths per year. Malnutrition-related diseases,&#13;
in particular acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI), account for an estimated 1,475 deaths per year, followed by&#13;
malaria with 631 deaths per year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Less serious diseases (scabies, helminthes, hepatitis A) appear to account for only a small proportion of the total.&#13;
There are no reported cases from official statistics of mortality from these diseases. Collectively these account for&#13;
only about 5.4 percent of the number of cases. However, their collective influence on the quality of life cannot be&#13;
ignored. The prevalence of trachoma is still high as it is endemic in Vietnam. The proportion of cases actually seeking&#13;
treatment for most diseases is only a small fraction of total cases, thus incurring lower health care costs than would&#13;
be the case if all cases sought formal health care.&#13;

     Economic Impacts of Sanitation in Vietnam&#13;

Table 15 presents the estimated total productivity costs related to days off daily activities for diseases related to&#13;
sanitation and hygiene. As expected, diarrhea diseases make up the largest proportion of these costs (67%). A direct&#13;
financial impact can be estimated by assuming a proportion of working adults lose income if time is taken off sick.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Table 16 presents the total costs of premature death from diseases related to sanitation and hygiene. The value&#13;
of premature death is based on human capital approach (see section A1.4). Financial costs reflect a single year&#13;
of income loss from premature death of an adult, while economic costs reflect discounted future earnings of all&#13;
premature deaths.&#13;

Figure 2 shows the variation in economic cost of premature death by using different values for premature death.&#13;
It shows that the current estimates are lower than those generated using the willingness to pay approach, using&#13;
adjusted values of premature death from US and European studies. Given the extrapolation from higher income&#13;
economies to Vietnam, an income elasticity of unity (1.0) cannot be assumed. At income elasticity assumptions of&#13;
below 1, the value f premature death increases.&#13;

Table 17 presents the estimated economic costs of the health impacts of poor sanitation and hygiene in Vietnam. It&#13;
shows that total economic costs to health are US$262 million per year, in which health care costs account for 16%,&#13;
productivity losses account for 4% and the remaining 80% are due to premature death.&#13;

              Figure 3 shows the contribution of different costs to overall cost, by disease. The main contributor to health-related&#13;
              economic costs of diarrhea, ALRI, measles, and malaria is premature death. For other diseases (helminthes, trachoma,&#13;
              scabies and hepatitis A), health care costs are the major contributor followed by productivity costs, as no deaths are&#13;
              reported from these diseases.&#13;

              3.3 Water resource impacts&#13;
&#13;
              The economic impacts of polluted water resources depend on three main factors: the extent of water resources in&#13;
              the country, the release of polluting substances in water resources, and the actual or potential uses of water in the&#13;
              country. Table 18 presents a summary of the water resources in Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              There are 9 major rivers in Vietnam, which are the Bang Giang-Ky Cung River, Thai Binh, River Red River, Ma River, Ca&#13;
              River,Thu Bon River, Ba River, Dong Nai River and the Mekong (Cuu Long) River.These major rivers account for 90% of&#13;
              the total area of river basins in Vietnam and their within-border area is around 80% of the total area of the country.&#13;

The main activities related to these water resources measured in this study include:&#13;
     · Withdrawal for treatment to provide drinking water&#13;
     · Other household uses&#13;
     · Commercial and subsistence fishing&#13;
&#13;
TheoverallpictureofwaterqualityinVietnamissummarizedbelow,extractedfromtheVietnamEnvironmentMonitor&#13;
(2003). The eight economic regions are largely formed within the major river basins and they differ from each other&#13;
in water quality. Red River Delta, Mekong River Delta and North East of Mekong regions are characterized by dense&#13;
river networks and abundant surface water resources. In these regions rapid population growth, urbanization and&#13;
industrialization, intensive agriculture, and water transport have resulted in worsening water quality and declining&#13;
groundwater levels.&#13;

              There is increasing evidence of pollution of Vietnam's surface, ground and coastal waters. Although the quality of&#13;
              upstream river waters is generally good, downstream sections of major rivers reveal poor water quality and most&#13;
              of the lakes and canals in urban areas are fast becoming sewage sinks. Total pollution of water resources from&#13;
              household sources is presented by region in Table 20. Annually, approximately 2.3 million tons of feces, 46 million&#13;
              cubic meters of urine and 610 million cubic meters of gray water are released into inland water resources annually&#13;
              in Vietnam.&#13;

              Water pollution caused by cottage or trade villages is now a very critical problem in Vietnam. The impact on surface&#13;
              water results from the inadequate collection of waste water and solids from food processing, wooden fine arts&#13;
              production and paper recycling. For ground water, the impact so far measured or documented is insignificant; there&#13;
              is currently no evidence linking ground water quality with solid waste from trade villages [10].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Table 21 presents water quality indicators measured in a number of water bodies throughout Vietnam, collected&#13;
              regularly by the Vietnam Environmental Protection Agency. It indicates different pollution levels by regions.&#13;

Table 22 shows the costs attributed to poor sanitation of access to drinking water, including only the daily needs per&#13;
capita for drinking water. Financial costs equal US$49 million while economic costs equal US$63 million per year.The&#13;
results indicate that the majority of financial and economic costs are incurred by households treating their water. An&#13;
estimated 20% of economic costs reflect the time required by households to access (haul) water from less polluted&#13;
water sources.&#13;

              Being a coastal country with territorial waters triple the area of the mainland and a variety of natural aquatic resources,&#13;
              Vietnam has great advantages in fisheries development. In addition, Vietnam also has much potential fresh water&#13;
              resources including rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, channels, low-lying paddy-fields, etc., which provide&#13;
              favorable conditions for fishing and aquaculture.&#13;

     Economic Impacts of Sanitation in Vietnam&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
According to statistics from GSO, the fisheries sector is one of the key economic sectors in Vietnam, and it maintains&#13;
higher growth rate than most other economic sectors. The share of fisheries sector in the country's GDP has grown&#13;
consistently from 2.9% in 1995 to 3.4% in 2000, reaching more than 4% in 2005. Aquatic products are a major&#13;
source of animal protein for people in Vietnam, providing about 40% of people's dietary protein. In 2005, almost&#13;
4 million people are directly employed in the sector and nearly 10% of the population derives their main income&#13;
from fisheries. Total export value of fisheries reached US$3.35 billion in 2006, accounting for over 10% of the total&#13;
export earning. Fisheries remain the second most important export-oriented sector in Vietnam, after the crude oil&#13;
industry.&#13;
&#13;

Total fisheries production in 2006 was 3.69 million tons, in which aquaculture accounts for 1.69 million tons and&#13;
2.00 million tons from marine and inland fishing. Over time, aquaculture has gained importance, and is now more&#13;
important than capture fisheries in terms of quantity, quality and production stability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wastewater from domestic, agricultural and industrial activities has increasingly contributed to pollution loads in&#13;
water bodies. The media reports many cases showing the heavy losses of aquaculture productivity due to water&#13;
pollution (see Box 1).&#13;
&#13;

Box 1. Loss of caged-fish farming in Ha Nam Province&#13;
&#13;
   Over the period 2000-2003, from November to March, polluted water from the Nhue River to the Day River&#13;
   killed many fish and shrimp. Water from Thanh Liet Dam (Hanoi) during November 22 to November 26,&#13;
   2003 caused heavy losses in Chau Thuy, Chau Giang, Phu Ly Commune, Ha Nam Province. Nguyen Van Nam,&#13;
   investing 70 million dong to raise caged fish, lost 3 tons of breed fish and 10 tons of valuable fish; Bui Quoc Ky&#13;
   lost 400 million dong along 2.5 km of river used to raise caged fish.&#13;

Table 24 presents the estimated losses to inland fisheries. On the assumption that "standard" poor sanitation&#13;
contributes 40% to the pollution of rivers, the projected losses are US$27.4 million. Using the broader definition of&#13;
sanitation, the attribution of losses is 80%, and the corresponding projected losses are US$54.7 million. See Annex&#13;

              3.4 Environmental impacts&#13;
&#13;
              In many places in Vietnam, human waste is a major cause of reduced air quality and spoiled visual appearance due&#13;
              to inadequate treatment and/or disposal. Like other countries in South East Asia, open and controlled dump sites&#13;
              are the dominant form of waste disposal in Vietnam. Only 12 out of 64 cities and provincial capitals have engineered&#13;
              or sanitary landfills; most were constructed during the past 4 years. The World Bank estimates that in 2004 only 17&#13;
              out of the 91 landfills in Vietnam, are sanitary landfills [7]. Discussion with Ministry of Construction suggests an even&#13;
              lower number of sanitary landfills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Average collection rates of solid waste in Vietnam are improving, but remain low in many cities. Spending on solid&#13;
              waste is just 0.18% of country GNP. Fees for collection of solid waste account for 0.5% of household expenditure&#13;
              [7].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Box 2. Problems with the Dong Thanh Dump Site in Ho Chi Minh City&#13;
&#13;
                 Dong Thanh is the second biggest dump site in Vietnam, located outside Ho Chi Minh City and with an area&#13;
                 of about 40 hectares. Due to the fact that the site is not sealed, wastewater percolates into the soil, causing&#13;
                 underground water pollution. Many nearby residents dig and drill wells and, in a 20 km circle, are now not able&#13;
                 to use this water because of its poor quality and obnoxious odours.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 Additionally, the leachate from the landfill (mainly from the wastewater storage lakes) into the surrounding areas&#13;
                 has caused damages to the production and living activities of the local people. Fish, pigs, chickens and ducks&#13;
                 have died and agricultural productivity is reduced. Wastewater from the waste storage lakes (about 200,000&#13;
                 m3 with average chemical oxygen demand concentration of about 40,000 ­ 50,000 mg/l) is not treated to&#13;
                 environmental standards and penetrates into the underground water strata.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 In June 2000, persistent heavy rain caused a 6 meter high dumpsite wall to collapse. A great deal of waste and&#13;
                 wastewater spilt out causing environment pollution and harming production and people living nearby.&#13;

3.5 Other welfare impacts&#13;
&#13;
In a survey conducted by WSP in 2002, 7 of 12 groups interviewed (58%) considered reputation with neighbors&#13;
and guests as a motivating factor to build a latrine. This factor includes the desire to be considered modern, save&#13;
face with guests, and get respect from neighbors, which shows that aesthetics is an important factor of improved&#13;
sanitation. [26]. No study exists on the intangible aspects of user preference impacts of poor sanitation in Vietnam.&#13;
A recent study of the Vietnam National Handwashing Initiative looked into availability of factors such as sanitation,&#13;
water and soap in and around the household. The study shows that there is a gap between hygiene theory and&#13;
practice, explained by cultural and practical factors [27].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Table 26 shows the economic impacts on access time. It indicates total productivity losses are about US$41.6 million&#13;
per annum.&#13;

Table 27 presents the estimated impacts of poor sanitation on school and work attendance. The table indicates estimated economic impacts&#13;
of about US$4.4 million. Most of these losses are accounted by work absenteeism. Almost all of these losses are explained by absenteeism of&#13;
working women.&#13;

&#13;
              Tourism is an important growing industry in Vietnam with 3.6 million foreign visitors in 2006, generating about&#13;
              US$3.2 billion in national tourism-related revenues (equivalent to 5.2% of GDP). The industry boasted very rapid&#13;
              growth over the last 15 years, and the Government of Vietnam aim to maintain this trend. Table 28 provides key&#13;
              information on the tourism industry in Vietnam since 2002. It shows steady growth in the number of tourist as well&#13;
              as the industry's share in the country's GDP.&#13;

              Table 29 shows the economic losses associated with the gap between current occupancy rate of 70% compared&#13;
              with an assumed optimal occupancy rate of 80% and, over time, increased tourist infrastructure. It indicates that the&#13;
              economic impact of lower tourist numbers attributed to poor sanitation (5% of losses) is US$68.6 million.&#13;

&#13;
              For policy decisions, it is not adequate to know only the economic losses associated with poor sanitation. Policy&#13;
              makers also need to know which of these costs can be mitigated with the implementation of different sanitation&#13;
              options. A number of generic features of improved sanitation options were defined in Table 7 (section 2.5) to enable&#13;
              estimation of costs mitigated under different options.&#13;

     Economic Impacts of Sanitation in Vietnam&#13;
50   A five-country study conducted in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines and Vietnam under the Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI)&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                                                                     ECONOMIC IMPACT RESULTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This study has estimated the losses associated with poor sanitation using an attributable fraction based on&#13;
representative indicators of impact, which varied by impact. For example, costs of polluted water were apportioned&#13;
to poor sanitation based on the contribution of poor household sanitation to overall water pollution. Likewise, a&#13;
proportion of sanitation-related diseases were attributed to exposure to human excreta, given that these diseases&#13;
also have other causes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Hence, based on this methodology, the reduction in pathogens, pollution and so on through improved sanitation,&#13;
should lead to partial or full mitigation of the estimated losses shown in section 3.1. Table 30 therefore presents the&#13;
estimated financial and economic gains from different features of sanitation and hygiene improvements.&#13;
&#13;
· Better physical access of latrines and more private as opposed to shared latrines bring US$43 million economic&#13;
     gain, through saving time for those whose time access is not already minimized.&#13;
&#13;
· The financial and economic value of sanitation markets are US$329 million, including sanitation input (US$127&#13;
     million) and output markets (US$202 million).&#13;
&#13;
· Improved toilet system leads to US$17 million financial gain and US$84 million economic gain through the&#13;
     reduction by 32% of the measured health impacts.&#13;
&#13;
· Hygiene practices bring US$23 million financial gain and US$231 million economic gain through reducing by&#13;
     45% the measured health impacts.&#13;
&#13;
· Treatment and/or safe disposal of human excreta leads to financial savings of US$239 million and economic&#13;
     savings of US$287 million due to less polluted water resources; and US$69 million gain in revenue from&#13;
     tourism.&#13;

Table 32 below shows the potential market size for sanitation outputs, based on market prices and approximate&#13;
breakdown between labor, materials, equipment and non-purchased items. According to a project on biogas in&#13;
Vietnam (MARD &amp; SNV), just 1% of total rural households in Vietnam are potential users of biogas system. The market&#13;
value is estimated at US$202 million, excluding the sales of biogas carbon credits through the Clean Development&#13;
Mechanism. The values are assumed to be both financial and economic gains, as use of human excreta for fertilizer&#13;
(US$163.7 million) and biogas generation (US$38.31 million) are expected to lead to cost savings.&#13;

ECONOMIC IMPACT RESULTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              As well as the narrow definition of sanitation assessed above, a broader definition includes the re-use of agricultural&#13;
              waste. With regards to raw waste materials, agricultural waste in Vietnam is estimated to total 30 million tons per&#13;
              year, consisting mainly of rice straw, husk, and bagasse. If this amount is taken into the energy value, it is equivalent&#13;
              to 20 million tons of dust coal and over 9 million tons of crude oil [10].This can become a significant source of energy&#13;
              once suitable policy and action plan are developed and implemented.&#13;

              Materially, agricultural waste has not only high energy value but can also be used as inputs for agricultural production&#13;
              and other industries. Agricultural waste can be reused as fuel for households (rice husk, sugar cane leave, rice straw&#13;
              etc), mushroom shelve (rice straw), cattle feed (maize tree), and cage-stuffing materials (rice straw). In addition, if&#13;
              agricultural waste is well managed, it can be the material provision for paper, pressed wood (bagasse), and thermal&#13;
              power production.&#13;

              3.8 Evaluation of Uncertainty&#13;
&#13;
              The present study is based on a range of secondary data and information, which were combined in a model to&#13;
              estimate the impacts of poor sanitation and the potential benefits of improving sanitation. Two major types of&#13;
              uncertainty surround the figures presented above. First, uncertainty exists in the values and assumptions used for&#13;
              the included variables. Second, there is uncertainty due to the fact that some impacts were not included (see section&#13;
              3,1,2). The first of these was evaluated quantitatively using sensitivity analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              One-way sensitivity analysis was applied separately on each impact by identifying some of the key areas of&#13;
              uncertainty, and using lower and upper ranges on selected data inputs. Figure 4 shows the resulting ranges on the&#13;
              five main impacts, which are also added together to give overall lower and upper values.&#13;

DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               4.1 Discussion&#13;
&#13;
               The primary objective of this study is to generate evidence on the negative effects of poor sanitation in Vietnam,&#13;
               focusing on the impacts on health, water resources, environment, tourism and other welfare indicators. The analysis&#13;
               was implemented using information from government and donor statistics and reports, and from the literature.&#13;
               The study found that poor sanitation leads to annual economic costs amounting to US$780 million or VND 12,544&#13;
               billion. This is equivalent to 1.3% of GDP 2005. Accordingly, the losses per capita are US$9.38 or VND 151,000. All&#13;
               these estimated economic impacts could potentially be mitigated with improved sanitation options, except the&#13;
               health impacts which are reduced by up to around 50%, depending on the effectiveness of the sanitation or hygiene&#13;
               intervention.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               The most important impact this present study can have is to raise awareness of all stakeholders for the purpose of&#13;
               improving the sanitation awareness in Vietnam. It is recommended this will lead to new policies, adoption of new&#13;
               approaches, collaboration with new partners, allocation of increased financial resources, adoption of new financial&#13;
               mechanisms and reinforcement of human resources for sanitation and hygiene. It is hoped that this study can&#13;
               contribute to advocating for the 'Unified Sanitation Sector Strategy and Action Plan'(U3SAP) in Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               In using secondary data to estimate impacts, and using new methodologies, the figures presented in this study are&#13;
               incomplete and imprecise. However, throughout the analysis, conservative assumptions were used, and combined&#13;
               with the fact that several impacts of poor sanitation were excluded due to lack of data, the quantified results are an&#13;
               underestimate of the true impacts of poor sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Also, lack of available evidence made it difficult to conduct gender analyses on many of the variables evaluated.&#13;
               Although Vietnam holds a reputation throughout the region for relative gender equality and has been able to&#13;
               close gender gaps in key areas [28], gender inequalities are still a barrier to improvement in water and sanitation.&#13;
               Women currently bear the main burden of problems associated with poor water supply and sanitation, particularly&#13;
               in rural areas. Furthermore, women have the primary responsibility for waste management [29] and for health,&#13;
               hygiene and sanitation in the family. In addition, they have to take charge of the children's hygiene education and&#13;
               to give instructions on personal hygiene and on the use of sanitation facilities. Lack of water and sanitation facilities&#13;
               inconveniences women more than men ­ for example, women's needs for private and sanitary toilets are much&#13;
               higher than those of men.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               The participation of women in the development of sanitation facilities is very crucial. Particular attention should be&#13;
               paid to gender issues and ensuring the representation of women as key decision makers in all aspects of water supply,&#13;
               sanitation and health management, especially in rural families. Women's views and concerns must be expressed and&#13;
               integrated into the design of interventions, such as special privacy, security and ergonomically requirements for&#13;
               both women and children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               The Joint Government - Donor Sector Review in 2005 emphasized the serious challenges facing Vietnam for&#13;
               sustainable sanitation [30]. This has a serious impact on the health of people, and especially affects children,&#13;
               the elderly and the poor who are most vulnerable to water-borne diseases. It also has a serious impact on the&#13;
               environment: concerns over water quality are an issue throughout the country. Furthermore, water and sanitation&#13;
               are clearly referenced in the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) which was approved&#13;
               by the Prime Minister in 2001. Sanitation is seen by the Government as a contributor to ensuring growth and poverty&#13;
               reduction. Therefore, it is necessary to consider further integrating sustainable sanitation into the Socio-Economic&#13;
               Plan of the country and sub-regions, ensuring that the voice of people without water or sanitation or those living in&#13;
               poverty can be listened to in the decision-making process. In this way socio-economic development will be aligned&#13;
               with sustainable growth.&#13;

       Economic Impacts of Sanitation in Vietnam&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                                            DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.2 Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
The central aim of this present study was to generate an evidence base to enable recommendations to be made for&#13;
improved sanitation policies. This study has identified a broad range of impacts of poor sanitation, and quantified&#13;
those impacts most amenable to secondary analysis. The following policy recommendations are based on eight&#13;
major findings of the study:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Major finding 1. Poor sanitation causes significant losses to the national economy&#13;
This study has found that poor sanitation is significant economic losses per year in theVietnam (1.3% of annual GDP).&#13;
In addition to these quantified impacts, a range of other negative economic and social effects of poor sanitation&#13;
result. By improving sanitation, a significant proportion of these socio-economic impacts can be mitigated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Recommendation 1. Decision makers from various sectors are advised to act now&#13;
Sanitation `players' are advised to act now, otherwise the negative impacts of poor sanitation will increase over&#13;
time. The government and other stakeholders should jointly reassess the current and planned spending levels in&#13;
the sanitation and related sectors, covering health, water resources, environment, rural and urban planning and&#13;
development, fisheries, and tourism. Increased political importance and budget allocations should be given to&#13;
sanitation. Sanitation decision makers should use an evidence-based approach to design efficient sanitation policies&#13;
and implementation strategies, to increase value-for-money from public and private investments into sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Major finding 2. Poor sanitation has greater impact on the poor and vulnerable&#13;
A greater share of the socio-economic burden of poor sanitation falls on the population currently without improved&#13;
sanitation ­ health impacts, time access, water pollution, aesthetics, and land use ­ hence causing inequities in&#13;
society. The population group unserved with improved sanitation tends to be the poorer and more vulnerable&#13;
members of society. A disproportionate share of the burden falls on women, children and the elderly, especially&#13;
health burden and user preferences such as intangible welfare impacts and life decisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Recommendation 2. Governments must define and target the needs of priority groups&#13;
The government should give priority to the populations with no latrine, recognizing that effective demand may be&#13;
low in these groups due to low incomes and poor awareness of the benefits of investing in sanitation. As well as&#13;
stimulating demand through public health and latrine advocacy messages, governments should target programs,&#13;
subsidies and financing mechanisms to the most disadvantaged population groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Major finding 3. Negative impacts result from several poor sanitary practices&#13;
Economic impacts occur not just through the use of unimproved latrines (MDG target), but also through poor&#13;
hygiene practices, poor isolation of wastewater from the environment and water sources, and poor broader&#13;
environmental sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Recommendation 3. Players should broaden the scope of sanitation beyond latrines&#13;
As is the aim of the current efforts to unify sanitation in the U3SAP, sanitation investments should not be made just in&#13;
latrine extension programs, but in improved sludge, water and solid waste management, and in hygiene programs&#13;
to raise population awareness on personal and community hygiene issues, among others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Major finding 4. Health-related economic impacts have a significant toll on society&#13;
This study has confirmed that the major and most tangible impact of poor sanitation is an increased risk of infectious&#13;
disease and premature death. This study has shown that economic losses of over US$262 million result from health&#13;
care costs, health-related productivity costs and premature mortality costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Recommendation 4. Health aspects of sanitation programs deserve central focus&#13;
The government should focus on the easy health wins from improved sanitation, through targeting children and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                             Economic Impacts of Sanitation in Vietnam&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               focusing on safe but simple latrine designs, improved excreta isolation measures, and improved hygiene practices.&#13;
               Given the key role of hygiene practices in health improvement, high-impact hygiene components should be&#13;
               integrated in the planning and implementation of sanitation programs. The Ministry of Health should (continue to)&#13;
               play a central role in the health aspects of sanitation programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Major finding 5. High water pollution levels are partially caused by poor sanitation&#13;
               The majority of human excreta eventually finds its way to water bodies; so do gray water, animal excreta, solid waste&#13;
               and industrial wastewater (jncluding from trade villages). Together these cause significant water pollution in study&#13;
               countries with associated high economic losses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Recommendation 5. Sanitation solutions should focus on reducing water pollution&#13;
               The government should urgently implement sanitation standards that reduce the release of waste matter into water&#13;
               resources. Low technology, low cost and effective options should be explored as a matter of priority. Focus should&#13;
               not be just on excreta, but also solid waste, household, agricultural and industrial wastewater. The contamination&#13;
               of groundwater with microbiological pathogens should be averted through better planning, increased resource&#13;
               allocation, and awareness raising. Water quality monitoring should be conducted to assess the extent and nature of&#13;
               water pollution and to inform populations of which water sources are safe to use.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Major finding 6. Sanitation is linked with sustainable development in many ways&#13;
               Sanitation has a major role in sustainable development, due to its links to other development goals (e.g. MDGs).&#13;
               Sanitation plays a key but unrecognized role in population welfare, economic growth and poverty reduction. Impacts&#13;
               not fully explored in this study ­ in particular tourism and the investment climate ­ are potentially major arguments&#13;
               for improving sanitation in countries, and suggest the adoption of a broader understanding of the term`sanitation'.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Recommendation 6. Several coordinated measures are needed to improve sanitation&#13;
               Sanitation cannot be only the responsibility of an individual sector/ministry, nor of a single level of government. The&#13;
               fact that sanitation touches on many sectors and line ministries should be used as a strength rather than hampering&#13;
               progress, and clear roles and responsibilities need to be defined. The development of a policy and regulatory&#13;
               framework for environmental and health protection is crucial and imperative in the context of rapid industrialization&#13;
               and high economic growth in Vietnam. While further progress is needed at the highest levels to ensure political&#13;
               support and resource allocations for sanitation, further emphasis is needed on the implementation levels where&#13;
               sanitation demand must be stimulated and affordable and attractive solutions for sanitation must be available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Major finding 7. Variability is expected in the actual impacts of poor sanitation&#13;
               While the national per capita costs in rural and urban areas was not found to be dissimilar, there will exist significant&#13;
               variation in the impacts of poor sanitation between different geographic locations depending on sanitation&#13;
               coverage, demographics, environment, and practices related to health and water consumption.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Recommendation 7. Local as well as national studies should inform sanitation policy&#13;
               To convince local decision makers such as city mayors or district officers to invest in sanitation, local studies would&#13;
               be more credible in convincing local decision makers that sanitation is a neglected issue. The methodology used in&#13;
               this study can be equally applied to local micro-level studies as well as the national level. Furthermore, local as well&#13;
               as national decision makers need to be informed of the efficiency of different measures to improve sanitation. Local&#13;
               level cost-benefits studies must now be performed to inform national decision makers how to invest efficiently in&#13;
               sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Major finding 8. Existing data sources are weak for quantifying sanitation impact&#13;
               This study has used a number of available data sources, but has been limited by lack of specific information on&#13;
               outcomes related to sanitation. With the exception of basic latrine coverage indicators, surveys tend not to include&#13;
               questions related to sanitation, such as expenditure, preferences, access time, health-related time loss, sanitation and&#13;
               hygiene practices, and gender. Questions related to broader sanitation`coverage'(e.g. waste disposal, environmental&#13;

quality) are largely left out. Routine government reporting systems such as health indicators and health service use,&#13;
and water quality monitoring, only imperfectly capture the substantial impacts of poor sanitation. Water quality is&#13;
known to be important for fish reproduction, growth and safety for human consumption, but little is known about&#13;
the exact relationships, and the role poor sanitation plays.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Recommendation 8. Future survey and research work is key in monitoring progress&#13;
Surveys and government reporting systems should be assessed for extension to include behavior and outcomes&#13;
related to sanitation. Selected research studies could fill important gaps in knowledge about the economic and&#13;
welfare effects of poor sanitation. Further research is required on the population benefits of improved sanitation, and&#13;
what levels of benefit different types of sanitation option can deliver. A gender perspective is key in understanding&#13;
the effectiveness of different sanitation options. The link between poor sanitation and tourism and foreign direct&#13;
investment losses is poorly understood, and merits further assessment. Studies on the value of time and the value&#13;
of life will allow a better understanding of the importance of the identified health impacts.&#13;

              A1. Health impact&#13;
&#13;
              Health impacts are usually considered to be one of the most significant impacts associated with poor sanitation&#13;
              and hygiene. Not only do diseases have direct implications for population welfare through health-related quality of&#13;
              life (HRQL), but diseases also have financial and economic impacts, which include spending on health care, loss of&#13;
              income or production, and in the case of premature death, the value of loss of life.&#13;

              viral, bacterial, parasitic, protozoal, helminthes, and fungal in nature, and have many pathways: fecal-oral, fecal-skin,&#13;
              urine-oral, and fecal-eye; the main one being fecal-oral [31, 32]. According to the F-diagram, pathogens can be&#13;
              passed from the feces through fluids, fields, flies and fingers [33]. In addition, food can act as an intermediary for all&#13;
              of these four direct transmission pathways. The principle `poor practices' which support heightened transmission&#13;
              of disease from human waste include an unsanitary toilet area, poor personal hygiene practices following toilet-&#13;
              going, open defecation in the fields or water sources, lack of protection or treatment of drinking water, poor food&#13;
              preparation practices, and lack of latrine and water-source protection in flood-prone areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Given the large number of diseases and health effects due to poor sanitation, this present study selected the key&#13;
              health impacts based on their epidemiological and economic importance. The availability of health data from&#13;
              national statistics, local research studies and international sources also played an important role in determining&#13;
              which diseases to include. Table A1 below presents data available from the national health information system in&#13;
              Vietnam on number of cases and deaths from key sanitation and hygiene-related diseases. Although these data are&#13;
              not representative of the total disease burden at national level due to underreporting, these data do provide an&#13;
              indication of which diseases are of most significance nationally to aid selection of diseases to include in this present&#13;
              study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              In addition, exposure to household solid waste, agricultural and industrial wastes can also lead to disease and&#13;
              premature death, from contact with toxic materials or otherwise dangerous substances. With respect to solid waste,&#13;
              health impact on population in the vicinity of dumps and landfills is very high. They are exposed to high levels of&#13;
              dust, germs, noxious substances, rodents and insect bites, which can result in various diseases like flu, dysentery,&#13;
              fever, tuberculosis, diarrhea, rash and scabies, asthma, pneumonia, parasites, articulation disorders and eye infections&#13;
              and bronchitis. The risk is even higher for waste pickers working in the dump sites. Waste pickers are exposed to&#13;
              bruises, factures, injuries and death. These diseases and occupational health problems are not considered in this&#13;
              present study due to time constraints and lack of routinely available data sources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Table A1 shows that diarrhea diseases accounted for 964,420 cases in 2005. Diarrhea is also the major sources of&#13;
              death due to poor sanitation and hygiene. Malnutrition is considered as an important disease related to sanitation&#13;
              and hygiene since there are nearly 1,800,000 children under five years of age suffering from malnutrition. Although&#13;
              the prevalence of helminthes and scabies are not high compared to diarrhea and malnutrition, these diseases are&#13;
              included because of their obvious links to poor sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Trachoma is endemic in Vietnam. For decades, trachoma control has been an important part of Vietnam's health&#13;
              agenda. Globally, it is estimated that there are 3.8 million cases of blindness and 5.3 million cases of low vision in&#13;
              countries known or suspected to have trachoma, resulting in $2.9 billion in lost productivity to low vision or blinding&#13;
              trachoma [34]. In Vietnam, through trichiasis surgery, antibiotic treatment and health and hygiene education, the&#13;
              national prevalence of active disease decreased considerably from 17.5% in 1975 to 7% in 1995 [35]. According to&#13;

a recent study carried out in 2006 by the International Trachoma Institute (ITI) and their main partners, the MOH&#13;
and the Institute for Ophthalmology, the trachoma prevalence rate is estimated at 1.76% in 2006 [35]. This study&#13;
indicates that there are still districts where trachoma remains a public health problem. In the central and northern&#13;
areas, trachoma prevalence is still high, especially in children.&#13;

A1.2 Health care cost estimation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Health care costs result from diseases associated with sanitation and hygiene. In order to estimate health costs&#13;
related to disease, it is necessary to compile information on disease rates for the selected diseases, treatment seeking&#13;
rates, as well as health systems variables such as treatment practices and unit costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Health care costs can fall on both the patient and the public health system, depending on where the sick person&#13;
seeks care from and the tariff rates in public facilities. Private health care is assumed to be fully financed by the&#13;
patient. Nationally, total expenditure on drugs accounted for 50% of total health expenditure and the annual drug&#13;
expenditure per capita was US$8.6 in 2005 [37]. Costs are both financial and economic in nature. Financial costs&#13;
include the marginal cost to treat patients at public facilities (mainly drugs), patient transport costs, as well as the full&#13;
costs of treatment in private clinics or self-treatment. Economic cost includes the financial costs plus the short-term&#13;
fixed costs of public health facilities such as staff, capital items and overheads.&#13;

              In order to estimate the costs of health care, it is necessary to know the total number of cases seeking health care from&#13;
              different providers. Given that government statistics are often incomplete, public facility treatment seeking figures&#13;
              were adjusted to reflect the total cases seeking care. Table A2 shows data extracted from the National Health Survey&#13;
              2001 - 2002, which shows where households seek care from for different diseases. Given the lack of alternative data&#13;
              on treatment seeking, these figures are assumed to apply to diseases associated with poor sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Table A2 shows that self treatment is the most common behavior, accounted for 65.9% of total cases. The treatment&#13;
              seeking behavior slightly varies by urban and rural areas, and by disease. Nationally, public provider treats 12.18% of&#13;
              total cases, while private clinics treat 17.32% of those.&#13;

Based on the number of reported cases in the public health system, and the place of treatment seeking (Table A2),&#13;
the total cases seeking treatment can therefore be estimated for each disease, for each health care provider, and for&#13;
each region of the country. Table A3 below presents the figures after they have been adjusted for attribution to poor&#13;
sanitation and hygiene: 90% for diarrhea [31], 48% for malnutrition [32], 100% for helminthes, 80% for scabies and&#13;
trachoma, and 60% for Hepatitis A. For diseases related to malnutrition, attributable fractions of disease incidence&#13;
for these diseases to malnutrition are 10.4% for ALRI/pneumonia and 4.1% for malaria, using regional estimates from&#13;
Fishman et al for the Western Pacific Region [38].&#13;

&#13;
In order to calculate the costs associated with the cases seeking health care, it is necessary to know the treatment&#13;
practices, the proportion of cases that are admitted for inpatient stay, and the costs associated with health care.&#13;
Table A3 shows these variables for treatment seekers who receive their care on an outpatient basis from public&#13;
providers, formal private providers, informal care, and self-treatment. For diarrheal disease, information from the&#13;
study on health care costs of diarrhea disease in Khanh Hoa province is used [39]. For ALRI, the costs were based&#13;
on the costing exercise to establish a case-based cost tariff covering 29 diseases, a recently published study by&#13;
the Ministry of Health [37]. Annex Table A5 and D4 provide more information on those studies. For other diseases,&#13;
data were generated through consultations and interviews with doctors from the Ministry of Health, its institutes&#13;
and hospitals. The interviews were used to identify key variables, including duration of diseases for severe and&#13;
non-severe cases, medical treatment requirements and related costs. The drug cost for helminthes is based on&#13;
practices by MOH/WHO helminthes program in Vietnam for the last 5 years, which use a single dose of albendazole/&#13;
mebendazole in accordance with WHO guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Annex Table A4 shows the unit costs for treatment seekers who receive their care on an outpatient basis from&#13;
hospitals. It indicates that the financial cost for diarrhea is US$3.76 and US$3.98 for urban and rural areas, respectively&#13;
[39].&#13;

              Disease takes people away from their occupations and daily activities, and regular sickness-related absences from&#13;
              school affects the ability of children to keep up with the curriculum and complete their education. Therefore, time&#13;
              lost from work, school or daily activities has a value.&#13;

              Given that time off work is determined by the severity of the disease, as well as whether the case was treated or not,&#13;
              assumptions were made on the proportion of cases that are severe, and the treatment seeking behavior associated&#13;
              with these cases. Annex Table A6 shows the data inputs for diarrhea and other diseases.&#13;

&#13;
              Given that time off work has an opportunity cost, and in some instances a real financial loss, time away from daily&#13;
              activities needs to be given a unit value to estimate overall financial and economic losses associated with disease.&#13;
              A commonly applied economic valuation technique for time loss is the human capital approach (HCA), which&#13;
              values time loss according to what the sick person could be earning in productive employment. Even when the&#13;
              person would not be earning income (especially in the case of children), time for leisure and other activities can be&#13;
              assumed to have a value greater than zero [40-43]. A second common approach, which measures the sick person's&#13;
              willingness to pay to avoid disease, can more accurately reflect the welfare effects of disease, but due to lack of data&#13;
              on willingness to pay, this approach is not used in this study. Hence HCA is used as it is simple and it reflects the time&#13;
              loss component of disease.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              This study distinguishes between financial and economic cost. For some adults, time spent away from productive&#13;
              activities will have a direct income-loss, while for others the salary may be paid for a maximum number of sick&#13;
              days per year. Given the self-employed and/or agricultural nature of agrarian societies of many Southeast Asian&#13;
              countries, loss of time from productive activities may not have immediate financial loss, but may lead to income-&#13;
              losses in the future unless a family member or business partner replaces their lost labor. In order to be conservative,&#13;
              financial cost is estimated as immediate income loss for those not paid their wage or earning an income from time&#13;
              lost due to sickness. For each country, this population is estimated based on the available published literature and&#13;
              interpretation of official statistics according to local work patterns and conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              For those not directly losing income, there will also be a welfare loss, which may include longer-term income-&#13;
              earning potential as mentioned above. In estimation of economic cost, this study recognizes the value of time lost&#13;
              from daily activities, whether productive working time, school time, or leisure time. Given that value of time varies&#13;
              according to what the person is doing with their time, economic`welfare'losses are valued at less than the financial&#13;
              losses described above. Research studies have shown a whole range of results on the value of time. This present&#13;
              study takes the economic value of time as 30% of the unit value of time. Furthermore, this study distinguishes&#13;

between the value of adults and of children's time, given that children do not generally have the same values as&#13;
adults. On the other hand, children's time is not worthless, given that children are or should be at school learning&#13;
and hence time away from school would mean lost education and eventually lower income levels [44]. Also, for&#13;
young children of non-school age, sickness will involve more time input from a carer, and hence incur a cost. In&#13;
study countries, caring for a child is mostly the mother's task and thus ill children are more likely to take the time of&#13;
women than men, thus hindering women from working. Given the limited empirical work on the value of children's&#13;
time, and very few precedents in terms of valuing children's time, a time value of 50% of adults time is given in this&#13;
present study [45].&#13;

Vietnam is still faced with a high prevalence of chronic malnutrition among the under five population and high&#13;
prevalence of low birth weight babies. Besides treatment costs, evidence for the relationship between malnutrition&#13;
and future productivity comes from an extensive literature spanning several fields including nutrition, physiology,&#13;
economics and history, reviewed recently by Martorell [46]. The Nobel Prize-winning economic historian Robert&#13;
Fogel demonstrated that about 30% of the rise in productivity in Europe during the last 200 years was directly due to&#13;
improvements in nutrition [47]. The underlying mechanism for the relationship between nutrition and productivity&#13;
is not well-understood. A recent UNICEF-funded study (Profiles Vietnam) indicated that low birth weight causes a&#13;
loss of US$41 million in 2010, most of which is explained by long-term productivity loss [48]. However, these long-&#13;
term productivity costs are not taken into account in this present study.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
              Cost of premature death is calculated by multiplying the number of deaths by the unit financial and economic value&#13;
              of a death. Considerable mortality is from poor sanitation as shown in Annex Table A9 below. Diarrheal disease is&#13;
              estimated to cause at least 4,579 deaths annually, almost 90% of which are children under five years of age.&#13;

              Premature death affects society in a number of ways, and has proven to be difficult to value with any degree of&#13;
              precision. As a result, economists have employed a range of methods for valuing premature loss of human life [49].&#13;
              The most tangible economic impact of premature death is the loss of a member of the workforce, with implications&#13;
              for the economic outputs generated. Hence, this approach, what has been termed the `human capital approach'&#13;
              (HCA) approximates the welfare loss by estimating the future discounted income stream from a productive person,&#13;
              from the time of death until the end of (what would have been) their productive life. However, this technique has&#13;
              been criticized for that fact that it values human life exclusively for its productive potential. Empirical evidence&#13;
              indeed proves that life has a value beyond the productive worth of a human, which both society as a whole and&#13;
              individuals are willing to pay for in order to safeguard [50, 51].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Various other methods are available to estimate this broader economic as well as inherent worth of human life:&#13;
              1.     Observations about actual market and individual behavior with respect to what they pay to reduce the risk of&#13;
                     death (e.g. safety measures) or what they are willing to accept for an increase in the risk of death (e.g. wage&#13;
                     premium for risky jobs). This approach is known as`hedonic pricing'.&#13;
              2.     Stated preference from individuals exposed to risk, using interview technique. This approach is known as&#13;
                     `contingent valuation'.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Both these approaches estimate directly the willingness to pay of individuals, or society, for the reduction in the&#13;
              risk of death, and hence are more closely associated with actual welfare loss compared with the human capital&#13;
              approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              The problem in valuing life is that the alternative methods can give very different estimates of the value of life, and&#13;
              applications of the same techniques to different contexts can also reveal very different implicit values in reducing&#13;
              the risk of death. For example, willingness to pay studies generally show greater value of life than the human capital&#13;
              approach. These variations and differences will affect the credibility of economic studies when used for policy&#13;
              decisions, and hence considerable care is needed in estimating and presenting the economic impact of premature&#13;
              loss of life to policy makers. Therefore, in order to sound more plausible to policy makers, this present study uses&#13;
              the more conservative human capital approach, described below. Sensitivity analysis explores the implications of&#13;
              alternative values for loss of human life using the willingness to pay approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Human capital approach&#13;
              The human capital approach summates the future years of income at the average age of death. Given lack of data&#13;
              on exact age of death, three time points of death were used: 2 years of age for the 0-4 age group; 9 years of age for&#13;

the 5-14 age group; and 40 years of age in the 15+ age group.The discount rate applied was 3%, reflecting the social&#13;
rate of time preference approximated by the long-term real interest rate. Also, given that per capita income grows&#13;
over time, a presumed long-term per capita income growth of 2% was applied to future incomes. Average income&#13;
was taken from the average compensation of employees for each country. For the younger age groups who will not&#13;
be in the work force for several years, the net present value of future earnings are further discounted to take this into&#13;
account. Values are shown in Table A18.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Financial costs of premature death were approximated using the human capital approach by assuming a coping&#13;
period following the loss of an adult member of the family. The coping period could be the period after which the&#13;
income of the lost adult is expected to be replaced. A period of 1 year is conservatively used in this study. Therefore,&#13;
the average compensation of employees for a single year is applied to the number of adult deaths to estimate the&#13;
financial impact of premature death. The average annual compensation of employees used is US$411 in Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Willingness to pay approach&#13;
Given the lack of estimates of willingness to pay for avoiding death in developing countries, and Southeast Asian&#13;
countries in particular, the benefits-transfer method was applied for the willingness to pay method. This essentially&#13;
involves taking value-of-statistical-life (VOSL) values from a meta-analysis of studies in developed countries and&#13;
transferringthevaluedirectlyusinganadjustmentfordifferencesinincome.Whilethisapproachhasmanyweaknesses&#13;
[52], the absence of data from developing countries justifies the use of this "benefits transfer" approach. The VOSL&#13;
reported in North American and European studies is highly variable, ranging from around US$1 million to more than&#13;
US$10 million [50, 53-57]. A meta-analysis of 40 VOSL studies reported by Bellavance et al in 2007 reported average&#13;
VOSL of US$9.5 million and median VOSL of US$6.6 million [58], similar to the mean estimate of US$5.4 million found&#13;
by Kochi et al (2006) [59]. Developing country studies are few. A study of the Indian labor market found VOSL varying&#13;
from roughly US$0.14 to US$0.38 million [60]. Given the large number of studies from OECD countries, an adjusted&#13;
benefit transfer is justified rather than transfer from a single study from a comparable developing country. In order&#13;
to remain highly conservative, a VOSL estimate of US$2 million is used, which is significantly lower than the values&#13;
presented in the meta-analyses conducted by Bellavance (2007) [58] and Kochi (2006) [59], but consistent with the&#13;
mid-range in the meta-analysis conducted by Mrozek and Taylor (2002) [61]. This value also reflects the lower end of&#13;
the US$2 million to US$4 million recommended by Abelson for public policy [50].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The VOSL of US$2 million is transferred to the study countries by adjusting downwards by the ratio of GDP per&#13;
capita in each country to GDP per capita in the USA. The calculation is made at both official exchange rates (more&#13;
conservative) as well as at purchasing power differences (less conservative), and assuming an income elasticity of&#13;
1.0. Direct exchange from higher to lower income countries implies an income elasticity assumption of 1.0, which&#13;
may not be true in practice. Therefore, the benefits transfer from OECD studies was also made at income elasticity of&#13;
0.8 and 0.6. Values are shown in Table A10.&#13;

              A1.5 Disease burden from diseases indirectly related to poor sanitation3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              The approach used here to estimate the indirect health effects of sanitation (via malnutrition) in children is as&#13;
              follows:&#13;
                     (a) the effect of diarrheal infections on children's nutritional status is first determined from a review of the&#13;
                            research literature;&#13;
                     (b) counterfactual nutritional status is then estimated, i.e., the nutritional status that would have prevailed in&#13;
                            the absence of diarrheal infections; and&#13;
                     (c) health effects of currently observed nutritional status and health effects of counterfactual nutritional status&#13;
                            are estimated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              The difference in health effects of observed vs counterfactual nutritional status is then the indirect health effects of&#13;
              diarrheal infections, caused largely by poor sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
              Commonly used indicators of poor nutritional status are underweight, stunting and wasting.4 Underweight is&#13;
              measured as weight-for-age (WA) relative to an international reference population.5 Stunting is measured as height-&#13;
              for-age (HA), and wasting is measured as weight-for-height (WH). Underweight is an indicator of chronic or acute&#13;
              malnutrition or a combination of both. Stunting is an indicator of chronic malnutrition, and wasting an indicator of&#13;
              acute malnutrition. Underweight status is most commonly used in assessing the risk of mortality and morbidity from&#13;
              poor nutritional status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              A child is defined as mildly underweight if his or her weight is in the range of -1 to -2 standard deviations (SD)&#13;
              below the weight of the median child in the international reference population, moderately underweight if the&#13;
              weight is in the range of -2 to -3 SDs, and severely underweight if the child's weight is below -3 SD from the weight&#13;
              of the median child in the reference population. The standard deviations are also called z-scores and noted as WAZ&#13;
              (weight-for-age z-score).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Repeated infections, and especially diarrheal infections, have been found to significantly impair weight gains in&#13;
              young children. Studies documenting and quantifying this effect have been conducted in communities with a&#13;
              wide range of infection loads in a diverse group of countries such as Bangladesh ([62], [63], [64]), Gambia ([65], [66]),&#13;
              Guatemala ([67]), Guinea-Bissau ([68]), Indonesia ([69]), Mexico ([70]), Peru ([71]), Philippines ([72]), Sudan ([73]), and&#13;
              Tanzania ([74]).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              These studies typically find that diarrheal infections impair weight gains in the range of 20-50 percent. A mid-point&#13;
              ­ i.e., 35 percent of children's weight deficit - is here attributed to diarrheal infections to estimate the indirect disease&#13;
              burden from sanitation.6 So in the absence of weight retarding infections, the weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) of an&#13;
              underweight child would be approximately 40 percent greater than the observed z-score (i.e., observed WAZ*(1-&#13;
              0.4)).7 For instance, if a child has a WAZ=-3, then in the absence of weight retarding infections, the child's WAZ would&#13;
              be -1.8.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Prevalence of underweight malnutrition rates are presented in Table A11. Current rates are for the most recent year&#13;
              available. None of the countries officially report the prevalence of mild underweight. Mild underweight is however&#13;

              4    Micronutrient deficiencies are not explicitly evaluated here, but are found in other studies to have a significant cost (World Bank, 2006;&#13;
                   Horton and Ross, 2003; Horton, 1999). Also, Alderman and Behrman (2006) find a significant cost associated with low birth weight, which in&#13;
                   part is caused by low maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (Fishman et al, 2004).&#13;

      Economic Impacts of Sanitation in Vietnam&#13;

important in relation to increased risk of child mortality [75]. This rate was therefore calculated for Cambodia and&#13;
Indonesia from the original household data in the Cambodia DHS 2005 and the Indonesia National Socioeconomic&#13;
Survey 2005. For the Philippines and Vietnam, the rate of mild underweight is assumed to be about the same as in&#13;
Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Counterfactual prevalence rates of underweight, i.e., prevalence rates in the absence of weight retarding infections&#13;
where calculated for Cambodia using the original household data in the Cambodia DHS 2005. This was performed&#13;
through the following procedure: Counterfactual WA z-scores were calculated for each underweight child in the&#13;
survey using the formula discussed above (i.e., WAZ reported for each child in the survey multiplied by (1-0.4)).&#13;
Counterfactual underweight prevalence rates were then tabulated using the counterfactual WA z-scores.The results&#13;
are presented in Annex Table A11. The original survey data in Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam were not&#13;
readily available for this purpose. Counterfactual prevalence rates were therefore estimated using counterfactual&#13;
rates calculated for Ghana and Pakistan [76]. These comparator countries, along with Cambodia, reflect a sufficient&#13;
range of counterfactual prevalence rates to estimate such rates for Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam.8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the absence of diarrheal infections, it is estimated that practically no children would be severely underweight and&#13;
the prevalence of moderate underweight would be as low as 2-3 percent.The prevalence of mild underweight would&#13;
increase significantly in Cambodia, slightly in Indonesia and the Philippines, and remain the same in Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Various health and debilitating effects from malnutrition are documented in the research literature. This includes&#13;
long term chronic illnesses from low birth weight, effects of iodine, vitamin and iron deficiencies, and impaired&#13;
cognitive development (United Nations, 2004; World Bank, 2006). The focus here is on mortality and morbidity in&#13;
children &lt; 5 years associated with underweight.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Fishman et al (2004) present estimates of increased risk of cause-specific mortality and all-cause mortality in children&#13;
under 5 with mild, moderate and severe underweight from a review of available studies. Severely underweight&#13;
children (WA &lt; -3 SD) are five times more likely to die from measles, eight times more likely to die from ALRI, nearly&#13;
10 times more likely to die from malaria, and twelve times more likely to die from diarrhea than non-underweight&#13;
children (WA &gt; - 1 SD). Even mild underweight doubles the risk of death from major diseases in early childhood&#13;
(Table A12).&#13;

              These relative risk ratios can be applied to the underweight prevalence rates in Annex Table A11 to estimate&#13;
              attributable fractions (AF) of mortality and morbidity from diarrheal infections through their effect on nutritional&#13;
              status (underweight status).9 The following formula is used to calculate attributable fractions of ALRI, measles,&#13;
              malaria, and "other causes" of mortality, and attributable fractions of ALRI and malaria morbidity incidence from&#13;

              rate in each of the WA categories (i). This formula is also called the "potential impact fraction" because it estimates&#13;
              the mortality or morbidity that would have been avoided for a different counterfactual population distribution (e.g.,&#13;
              less children being underweight) exposed to those levels of risk of mortality or morbidity. For a further discussion&#13;
              of this formula, see Ezzati et al. (2004).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              For diarrheal mortality and morbidity the AF estimation procedure would be different because there are two risk&#13;
              factors, i.e. the direct effect of sanitation and the indirect effect through malnutrition. As already 88 percent of&#13;

Complete records or statistics on annual cases of ALRI and malaria in children u5 are not available in any country.&#13;
This is due to many reasons, including incomplete reporting and record systems, cases never treated at health care&#13;
providers, and incomplete or potentially incorrect case identification and diagnostic. Annual cases therefore need to&#13;
be estimated. WHO provides regional estimates of ALRI for the year 2002, the most recently available (WHO, 2004b).&#13;
These data suggest that the incidence of ALRI in children u5 in Asia is on the order of 0.35 to 0.7 cases per child&#13;
per year. An annual incidence of 0.35 cases of ALRI is therefore applied to Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam.&#13;

              In Cambodia, which still faces more health challenges than many of the other countries in the region, an annual&#13;
              incidence of 0.5 is applied. Annual incidence in all children u5 is the incidence per child multiplied by the number&#13;
              of children (Table 50).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              The incidence of malaria is likely more uncertain than the incidence of ALRI.The regional WHO data for 2002 suggest&#13;
              that the incidence of malaria in SEARO B is 0.07 cases of malaria per child per year. Indonesia holds a large share of&#13;
              the population in this region.The incidence of malaria inWPRO B is only 0.001 per child per year, as China constitutes&#13;
              more than 80 percent of the population in this region and has very low incidence of malaria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              A recent paper by WHO (Korenromp, 2005) estimates that the global incidence of malaria in 2004 was 6 times&#13;
              higher than recorded in national health information systems, and around 17 times higher in non-African countries.&#13;
              The estimated country population incidence in Korenromp (2005) indicates that the incidence in children u5 could&#13;
              range from 0.16 cases per child per year in the Philippines, 0.27 cases in Vietnam, 0.39 cases in Indonesia, and 0.8&#13;
              cases per child in Cambodia.11 These estimates are however very uncertain. A much more conservative estimate&#13;
              would be to assume that the incidence in children u5 in Indonesia is 0.07 cases per child per year (as reported for&#13;
              SEAR B for the year 2002) and that the incidence in the other countries are in the same proportion relative to the&#13;
              estimated incidence in Korenromp (2005).This approach gives an estimated incidence of 0.03 in the Philippines, 0.05&#13;
              in Vietnam, 0.07 in Indonesia, and 0.14 in Cambodia. Using the incidence rates, annual cases of malaria in children&#13;
              u5 are presented in Annex Table A16.&#13;

              Applying equation (2) to the cases of mortality and illness in Annex Tables A14 and A16 provides an estimate of&#13;
              mortality and morbidity from poor sanitation (table 9). Mortality in children from protein-energy malnutrition (PEM)&#13;
              is estimated separately using the methodology in Fishman et al. (2004) and attributing a fraction of this mortality to&#13;
              sanitation in proportion to the effect of diarrheal infections on malnutrition. Diarrheal mortality from poor sanitation&#13;
              is 88 percent of total diarrheal mortality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              About 95 percent of estimated annual mortality is in children under 5. In children under 5, mortality directly&#13;
              attributable to poor sanitation (i.e., diarrheal mortality) constitutes 13-19 percent of total under 5 child mortality.&#13;
              Mortality attributable to sanitation from malnutrition (i.e., the indirect effect of infections through malnutrition)&#13;
              constitutes 16-20 percent of total under 5 child mortality. Total attributable mortality to sanitation is 30-37 percent&#13;
              of total under 5 child mortality (Annex Table A17).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              For morbidity in children under 5, ALRI attributable to sanitation from malnutrition constitutes 13-19 percent of&#13;
              annual cases, and malaria attributable to sanitation constitutes 5-8 percent of annual cases (Annex Table A18)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              11 Korenromp only present population incidence. The WHO regional data indicate that the incidence in children u5 in SEARO B is 4.5 times&#13;
                   higher than the population incidence. This ratio is applied to the estimated population incidence in Korenromp to estimate incidence in&#13;
                   children u5.&#13;

A2 Water resources&#13;
&#13;
While domestic sources contribute importantly to water pollution in most developing countries, where the majority&#13;
of households do not have their excreta, sewage or wastewater safely disposed of or treated. However, the presence&#13;
of other sources of water pollution means that overall economic impact of polluted water cannot be attributed to&#13;
poor sanitation alone. Pollutants which affect water-related economic activity include microorganisms, organics,&#13;
chemicals, solids, gases and heat [77]. Pollution originates from a variety of sources:&#13;
     · Households (excreta, sewage and grey water from bathing, laundry, cooking)&#13;
     · Small industries (garments, dying, washing, food processing, brewery)&#13;
     · Leachate from sanitary landfill for solid wastes ­ or more usually ­ dump sites&#13;
     · Manufacturing industries (production or processing)&#13;
     · Chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and treatment of acid-sulfate soils&#13;
     · Animal waste&#13;
     · Silt release following build-up behind dams&#13;
     · Salinity intrusion from coastal areas&#13;
&#13;
Major categories of water use include drinking water, domestic uses, crop and fish production, energy production,&#13;
industry, recreation and transport. For some of these activities, good quality water is important ­ such as for drinking&#13;
­ while for other uses water quality standards are not so strict such as for agricultural and some industrial uses.&#13;
Therefore, only selected impacts of polluted water are examined in this present study, with selection of uses of water&#13;
where there is a strong proven association between poor sanitation and the associated costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A2.1 Water quality measurement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Inland water quality is affected by many variables, the two main ones being the quantity of polluting substances&#13;
releasedandtheoverallquantityofwaterresourcesforabsorptionofthepollutionload.Hence,waterqualityindicators&#13;
will need to be interpreted based on these two variables, as well as the multitude of factors that determine these&#13;
variables. Furthermore, the economic impact of polluted water depends on what productive and non-productive&#13;
uses the different water resources have, or could have assuming improved water quality. Box31, sourced from the&#13;
Vietnam National Resources Water Strategy for 2006, states the issue of pending water scarcity in Vietnam.&#13;

              Box 3. Vietnam's water resources are unsustainable&#13;
&#13;
                 The current average per capita surface water availability from the total volume of water in rivers within Vietnam&#13;
                 is about 3,840 m3 per year. If water inflows from outside the country are included, the average per capita river&#13;
                 water availability is 10,240 m3 per year. Taking population growth into consideration, by 2025 the average per&#13;
                 capita surface water availability will be 2,830 and 7,660 m3 per year. According to standards of the International&#13;
                 Water Resources Association (IWRA), nations with average per capita water availability lower than 4,000 m3 per&#13;
                 year are considered nations with inadequate water supply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 Water resources are not evenly distributed over different regions. About 60% of river water is concentrated&#13;
                 on the Cuu Long River delta (Mekong River). The remaining 40% is spread over nearly 80% of the nation's&#13;
                 population and over 90% of production, trade and other service activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 The average volume of water in 3-5 months in the wet reason makes up 75 - 85% of the total volume, while the&#13;
                 7 or 9 months of the dry season receives 15 - 25% of the year's water quantity.&#13;

              Water quality monitoring is limited in Vietnam. Different organizations or agencies are interested in different uses of&#13;
              water, and hence measure different water quality indicators. The Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment&#13;
              (MONRE) is responsible for monitoring both surface and ground waters. The Ministry of Fishery monitors water&#13;
              quality in aquaculture areas and the Ministry of Health is responsible for monitoring quality of drinking water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Hydrological and Meteorological Services (MHS) of MONRE maintains a network of about 230 hydrological&#13;
              monitoring stations. It operates a national groundwater monitoring network with 300 regional monitoring stations&#13;
              and more than 600 observation wells across Vietnam. Monitoring operates upon a periodic schedule, once or twice&#13;
              monthly. In addition to water temperature, pH, and turbidity, other parameters are measured such as discharge,&#13;
              water level, ferrum, silica, calcium, magnesium, chloride, sulfate, bicarbonate, and chemical oxygen demand (COD).&#13;
              However, these measurements are mainly for hydrological and meteorological purposes rather than environmental&#13;
              purposes. With respect to monitoring water quality for environmental purpose, there are rather fewer stations under&#13;
              the Vietnam Environment Protection Agency (VEPA) which monitor water quality in selected water bodies. These&#13;
              stations measure parameters like dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), COD, ammonium,&#13;
              nitrate, chloride, heavy metals, zooplankton, phytoplankton, oil, etc. However, as data from regular sources is not&#13;
              sufficient, external consultants are sometimes engaged by VEPA to carry out the monitoring and investigation of&#13;
              waterqualityinselectedareas.TheGovernmenthasnowrecognizedtheneedtoestablishwaterqualitymanagement&#13;

              A2.2 Contribution of poor sanitation to water pollution&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Water pollution from domestic sources can be estimated from the annual release or eventual seepage of untreated&#13;
              feces, urine and gray water into inland water bodies. It is estimated by applying the number of population with&#13;
              unimproved sanitation, the proportion of sewage released to water bodies, and average human (and animal) waste&#13;
              production per year. Annex Table A19 presents the figures and assumptions behind the release of human waste to&#13;
              water bodies. Pollution load from human waste is based on 0.15 kg feces and 1.5 liters urine per person per day. The&#13;
              following table shows the volume of waste per produced by some animals per day.&#13;

The pollution in the water bodies is generated from three sources of industry, agriculture and domestic activities.&#13;
They vary between rivers and regions of the country. For the Cau River sub-basin the major pollution is caused&#13;

              by industrial production, craft villages and urban runoff. In the Nhue-Day River sub-basin, domestic wastewater&#13;
              accounts for the biggest proportion of wastewater (56%), making the Nhue - Day sub-basin different to many other&#13;
              basins. Industry contributes 24% of the wastewater and craft villages 4%. Major pollution in the Dong Nai River basin&#13;
              is dominated by domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater. [3]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              In this present study, it is not possible to calculate the contribution of various sources to overall water pollution using&#13;
              BOD. However, it is estimated by the Consultants that domestic source contributes 40% of BOD to overall pollution&#13;
              of water bodies in Vietnam. If additional components of sanitation in Vietnam are included (agricultural waste and&#13;
              waste from trade villages), it is assumed that expanded"sanitation"contributes 80% of total BOD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              A2.2.1 Cost implications of water pollution for drinking water supply&#13;
&#13;
              Both water consumers and water providers treat water because water sources are not clean. More wealthy&#13;
              populations purchase bottled water which is either chemically treated or from a protected (mineral) source. The&#13;
              more polluted the water source, the more likely the household will take some form of precautionary measures, thus&#13;
              leading to higher unit costs of treatment. In some cases, households will not haul water from more polluted water&#13;
              sources if less polluted sources are available, but it may lead to time or financial costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Given that drinking water sources are polluted from several sources and not just from poor sanitary practices, by&#13;
              removing the human (and animal) waste component of polluted water, the need to treat water is not altogether&#13;
              removed. However, the removal of human and animal waste content from water sources may reduce the necessity&#13;
              for treatment or lowers the unit cost of treatment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Annex Table A23 below shows selected drinking water quality standards. Some of the main indicators which will&#13;
              cause households to purchase, treat or walk further to access cleaner water are perceived or actual presence of&#13;
              infectious pathogens (microbial agents) and heavy metals, bad odour due to organics, turbidity caused by solids,&#13;
              and bad taste due to low pH and solids.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              For the purposes of cost estimation, household drinking water sources are sub-divided into three categories, data&#13;
              for which are presented in Table A24 at national level and rural-urban breakdown.:&#13;
&#13;
                     1. Households receive piped water supply, either from water treatment companies or from open community-&#13;
                            managed sources. The table below shows that 19.08% of households receive piped water from water&#13;
                            supply companies.&#13;
&#13;
                     2. Households purchase water from other non-piped suppliers, such as tanker truck, water by the bucket, or&#13;
                            bottled water. The table indicates that 0.5% of households purchase water from vendors.&#13;
&#13;
                     3. Households collect water from free or low cost community or public sources. Hauled water accounts for&#13;
                            26.16% of total sources of drinking water. Drilled and other wells explain the rest (54.22%).&#13;

For all of these categories, households often treat their water for drinking purposes, even when the water sources&#13;
has been protected or properly treated. In Vietnam, this figure is 30% of households, with higher rates in rural&#13;
households due to lower rates of pre-treated piped water and high likelihood of contamination. Several methods&#13;
exist for household water treatment, including chemical treatment, filtration, boiling, and solar disinfection. The&#13;
main methods in Vietnam are boiling [8]. In addition to households, some industries also have to treat water that&#13;
does not conform to the required properties for certain industrial processes. However, these costs are excluded in&#13;
this present study.&#13;

              Various methods are available to estimate of costs of avertive behavior to avoid drinking polluted water. The lower&#13;
              limitonfinancialcostcouldbereflectedbyidentifyingspecificactionstoremovebacteria,suchaschemicaltreatment&#13;
              for piped water, open wells, and household treatment. The upper limit on financial cost of avertive behavior can be&#13;
              reflected by apportioning to poor sanitation a fraction of the total cost of water treatment and purchase. However,&#13;
              it is noted that households choose more convenient but more costly water sources for a variety of reasons, which&#13;
              include (but are not limited to) water pollution, convenience of access, time savings and no other available water&#13;
              supply. Hence the allocation of costs to sanitation has to be adjusted downwards by 50%. The economic costs of&#13;
              access to clean drinking water includes not only the financial cost, but also the efforts made by households to access&#13;
              clean water, such as walking further to access cleaner water sources, or the time taken to treat water in the home.&#13;
              See Annex B for algorithms for calculation of water access cost for different water sources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              The algorithms were applied at national level due to lack of regional breakdown. Data available on drinking water&#13;
              sources from GSO is used. Piped water price was assumed on basis of government stipulated price (VND 2,500 ­VND&#13;
              8,000 per m3). Price of purchased water was assumed conservatively using data from some World Bank projects at&#13;
              VND 8,000 per m3. Household water treatment practices are presented in the table below [8].The minimum drinking&#13;
              water per capita per day was assumed to be 4 liters, taken from WHO sources [79]. For hauled water, the proportion&#13;
              of households traveling further to access cleaner water was based on populations living close to polluted water&#13;
              sources which are unusable for drinking water purposes (lakes, rivers and polluted groundwater); while additional&#13;
              journey time was taken from international studies of time for collecting drinking water since there is no secondary&#13;
              data available in Vietnam concerning this issue. The Global Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment 2000 Report&#13;
              (WHO and UNICEF 2000) indicated that an average household required a journey of more than 30 minutes to collect&#13;
              water per day. These time-saving figures are confirmed by the Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys of the United Nations&#13;
              Children's Fund (UNICEF). A recent analysis of the responses in 23 African and Asian countries produced a similar&#13;
              result (G. Keast, UNICEF, 2003). A conservative estimate of 15 additional minutes per day for water collection due&#13;
              to pollution of local water sources is used in this study. For households, it is assumed that water treatment costs&#13;
              (boiling) are US$5 per m3 in rural area and US$8 per m3 in urban area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              The attribution to poor sanitation of the overall costs of sourcing clean water was made differently for the different&#13;
              costs:&#13;

                            characteristics of water available from local sources (taste, color, cloudiness) are also taken into account,&#13;
                            which often account for switching sources. Based on the discussion above with WSP Vietnam, this fraction&#13;
                            is conservatively estimated at 40%&#13;
                     · Attributable fraction of water treated due to poor sanitation is the same as above variable.&#13;

                 The Dong Nai River at Hoa An Pumping station (supplying water to HCMC and Bien Hoa City) is now polluted&#13;
                 with BOD5 concentrations at twice the standard. The price for each m3 of water after treatment increases by&#13;
                 4,658 VND (which is more expensive than the present price per m3 of water supply). The result will be that the&#13;
                 price for each m3 of water after treatment is 9,077 VND/m3. Therefore, on average per day, the Thu Duc water&#13;
                 station has additional costs of roughly 5.9 billion VND.&#13;

A.2.2.2 Water quality and fish production value&#13;
Fisheries in Vietnam&#13;
Fisheries play a very important role in Vietnam in providing employment, income and food security to many people.&#13;
Many Vietnamese depend upon fish as a central part of their diet from which they obtain protein and vital nutrients&#13;
and vitamins. Currently, the fisheries sector employs around 4,000,000 people and contributes 4% to the country's&#13;
GDP (in 2005). The fisheries sector is one of the key economic sectors in Vietnam, and it maintains higher growth&#13;
rate than many other sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Pollution and fish production&#13;
Pollution and river diversion have allegedly driven freshwater fisheries into collapse worldwide, and the extinction&#13;
of freshwater species far outpaces the extinction of mammals and birds [80-82]. Fish populations are affected by&#13;
a multitude of changes taking place due to human interventions, such as hydroelectric dams, water diversions for&#13;
agriculture, flood control levees, dredging, water pollution, and habitat degradation such as logging. According to&#13;
FAO, the long-term productivity of fish stocks are related to the carrying capacity of their environment, which alter&#13;
as a result of natural variability and of changes induced by human activity, such as coastal habitat degradation,&#13;
destructive fishing methods and pollution." (page 47, [83]). Environmental degradation has been cited as one of&#13;
the key threats to inland fish producers in countries of the lower Mekong basin [84]. Of particular concern for water&#13;
quality for fish production in Southeast Asia are suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, heavy metals and pesticides&#13;
[85]. However, as one of the few publications on water quality and fish production in Asia notes (writing in 1986)&#13;
"data on the effect of water quality on Asian species of fish are not readily accessible"(page 15, [85]). Furthermore, it is&#13;
difficult to predict the exact impact of water pollution on fish production given variations between fish species and&#13;
the multiple other determinants of fish production such as food availability, water depth, flow, and temperature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Domestic sources contribute importantly to water pollution, largely through the biological oxygen demand (BOD)&#13;
exerted by organic matter which reduces dissolved oxygen levels [86]12. Fish living below a sewage treatment plant&#13;
had significantly higher mortality rate than fish upstream [87-89]. Pharmaceutical discharge in urine can affect fish&#13;
health directly. The scientific literature testifies, albeit incompletely, to the adverse effects of sewage release on fish&#13;
reproduction and fish growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
One key determinant of fish health which has received attention from scientists is the level of dissolved oxygen [87-&#13;
97]. For example, experiments undertaken in Canada on native fish and benthic macroinvertebrate species showed&#13;
that exposure to low dissolved oxygen and low temperatures caused delays in hatching of eggs, reduced mass of&#13;
fish post-hatch, and depressed feeding rates and lowered survival of fish [93].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Additionally, micro-organisms contained in human and animal waste such as parasites and bacteria have a number&#13;
of implications for fish health [84, 91, 92, 96, 97], as well as safety of fish for human consumption [87, 90, 98-101].&#13;
Common illnesses from contaminated fish and shell fish include typhoid, salmonellosis, gastroenteritis, infectious&#13;
hepatitis, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus infections, paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), and amnesic&#13;
shellfish poisoning (ASP).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A further consideration that needs to be addressed is the fact that, in many contexts, the nutrients from sewage act&#13;
as a source of food for fish, and hence positively affect the production of fish. This happens both intentionally, when&#13;
sewage is fed to farmed fish in a regulated way, and unintentionally when fish in open water bodies are exposed to&#13;
untreated sewage disposed upstream. Vu Quyet Thang reported the positive impact of sewage and domestic waste&#13;
water on fish farming in Vietnam [102], Hence, in recognizing the benefits of sewage for fish production, the impact&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12 A major determinant of fish reproduction, growth and survivability is dissolved oxygen (DO). When an organic waste is discharged into an&#13;
    aquatic system, a biological oxygen demand (BOD) is created. BOD is a measure of the oxygen required to break down organic compounds,&#13;
    and high BOD levels significantly deplete the amount of dissolved oxygen in surface water. Consequently high BOD levels have a detrimental&#13;
    effect on the health of aquatic species that require elevated levels of DO. From human waste, damages result from direct biological oxygen&#13;
    demand, as well as increased growth of algae from nitrates and phosphorous contained in human waste.The algae biodegrade the nutrients,&#13;
    thus reducing the amount of DO available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                  Economic Impacts of Sanitation in Vietnam&#13;

&#13;
              analysis addresses only unregulated, unintentional, pollution of water with sewage. It should be noted, though, that&#13;
              sewage-fed farmed fish may not be optimally managed, and negative health effects need to be recognized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              The paragraph below describes the pollution of some major river basins in Vietnam. Pollution levels of rivers in the&#13;
              lower reaches of the Dong Nai River Basin are the worst inVietnam.TheThiVai River is the most polluted in basin with&#13;
              a"dead"section of 10 km, and drainage canals in inner Ho Chi Minh City suffer similar levels of pollution - extremely&#13;
              low DO levels, and high levels of N-NH , mercury and zinc. The water is seriously polluted by organic substances and&#13;
                                                                      4&#13;
              is a blackish brown color with fetid odors, in both high and low tidal periods. The DO value is often lower than 0.5&#13;
              mg/l (Figure 2.42). With the DO value at nearly zero, biological species are unable to live. [3]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              The average level of DO in Cau River is 6.5 mg/L for the section from Lien Mac to Cau Dien. From Cau Dien to&#13;
              downstream, level of DO reduced considerably to 4.5 mg/L. At To Lich junction, DO value is less than 1 mg/L.[3]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Methods for modeling the relationship between water pollution and fish production&#13;
              Given the lack of empirical evidence linking water quality and fish production in Vietnam, this study uses innovative&#13;
              methods to examine the likely importance of sewage release for fish production. While the following three key links&#13;
              are identified, only the first is assessed quantitatively in this study:&#13;

                                  to humans via fish consumption, due to inadequate de-contamination of fish prior to consumption.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              This study assesses the water quality indicators available for different freshwater locations where fish are (or used&#13;
              to be) farmed or caught, and assesses the various issues related to fish reproduction, fish populations, and overall&#13;
              fish health, and attributes estimated economic impact to poor sanitation (sewage and grey water release) as one of&#13;
              several sources of water pollution in those water bodies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              The focus of this study is on freshwater fish, given that dissolved oxygen is more affected in water bodies where&#13;
              oxygen depletion is more acute, resulting from release of untreated sewage into freshwater.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Annex Table A25 indicates that the Red River delta and South East are the two regions with lowest DO levels in&#13;
              Vietnam. They are the two most densely populated delta areas in Vietnam with two polluted river basins of Nhue-&#13;
              Day and Dong Nai. In addition, industrial zones and craft villages are highly developed in these two regions causing&#13;
              pollution in water bodies. DO levels are higher in the 6 other regions of the country. Levels of DO vary between&#13;
              rivers, between sections of a river, and a number of `hot spots' of pollution are noted, from both industrial and&#13;
              domestic sources. As a result, the average level of DO may not truly reflect the pollution of water bodies, especially&#13;
              in hot spots of pollution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              13 Dissolved oxygen was selected as the key water quality parameter because aquatic organisms require oxygen in specified concentration&#13;
                   ranges for respiration and efficient metabolism, and because dissolved oxygen concentration changes above or below this range can have&#13;
                   adverse physiological effects. Even short-lived anoxic and hypoxic events can cause high mortality rates of aquatic organisms. Exposure to&#13;
                   low oxygen concentrations can have an immune suppression effect on fish which can elevate their susceptibility to diseases for several years.&#13;
                   Moreover, the toxicity of many toxicants (lead, zinc, copper, cyanide, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and pentachlorophenol) can double when&#13;
                   DO is reduced from 10 to 5 mg/L.The amount of oxygen available in the water also decreases with temperature and when plants die. Oxygen&#13;
                   requirements increase at a higher temperature (e.g. an increase in water temperature from 10 to 20°C at least doubles the oxygen demand).&#13;
                   The presence of other pollutants such as nitrogen and marine life overcrowding reduce DO levels. In cloudy conditions, plants use up more&#13;
                   of the available DO. Plants proliferate with the presence of nitrate and phosphates from agricultural run-off, sewage and excess fish feed.&#13;

in a given period, comprising production of caught products and production of farmed products (aquaculture).&#13;
Production of caught product (fishing) includes marine fishing and inland fishing (from rivers, streams, lagoons,&#13;
or ponds). Production of farmed products includes all aquatic production from aquaculture. Aquaculture mainly&#13;
comprises freshwater culture of fish and brackish-water culture of shrimp and prawn. Freshwater means water with&#13;
salinity less than 0.5%. The focus of this present study is on freshwater fish caught or farmed, given that dissolved&#13;
oxygen is more affected in water bodies where oxygen depletion is more acute, resulting from release of untreated&#13;
sewage into freshwater. All freshwater fishes are included in this study, while products from marine fishing and&#13;
culture of shrimp and prawn are excluded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It is recognized that the impact of poor sanitation on fish stock, fish growth and eventual fish catch is extremely&#13;
difficult to quantify. Coefficients linking water body pollution and yield reduction have not been developed. For&#13;
a crude quantification of the possible loss in fish value due to water pollution, a modeled relationship based on&#13;
assumptions is used, represented in Figure A1. The Figure shows the estimated reduction in volume of fish caught&#13;
at lower levels of dissolved oxygen, for an average fish species in Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The amount of oxygen needed for the survival of fish varies with time of year and species. Oxygen needs vary even&#13;
with the life stage of a species. Young species tend to be more sensitive to low oxygen conditions than adults. Also&#13;
important is the duration of periods with low oxygen. Most species can survive short periods of reduced oxygen,&#13;
but suffer during longer periods. According to Meck [95] and others, the minimum limiting oxygen concentrations&#13;
for a fish is dependent upon its species, physical state, level of activity, long term acclimation, and stress tolerance. A&#13;
research study from the USA examined the lowest DO at which different fish species survived for 24 hours, varying&#13;
from 6.0 mg/L down to 3.3 mg/L [94]. Usually larger fish are affected by low DO before smaller fish. Given the lack&#13;
of published studies on the empirical relationship between these two variables, the following assumptions made&#13;
used based on a mixture of available scientific literature, internet sources, and expert opinion. A range is assessed in&#13;
sensitivity analysis, shown by dotted line in Figure A1.&#13;
      · Water with an oxygen concentration of less than 3.0 mg/l will generally not support fish. When&#13;
           concentrations fall to about 3.0-4.0 mg/L, fish start gasping for air at the surface or huddle around water&#13;
           falls or higher concentration points.&#13;
      · Numerous scientific studies suggest that 4.0-5.0 parts per million (ppm) of DO is the minimum amount&#13;
           that will support a fish population for short periods of 12-24 hours.&#13;
      · Above 5.0 mg/l, almost all aquatic organisms can survive indefinitely, provided other environmental&#13;

                            parameters are within allowable limits. When there are too many bacteria or aquatic animal in the area,&#13;
                            they may overpopulate, using DO in great amounts [88].&#13;
                      · Levels of 6.0 mg/L and above supports spawning, and above 7.0 mg/L supports growth and activity [93,&#13;

&#13;
              Notes: the upper line represents the maximum effect of reduced DO levels on fish production volume, with linear reduction from 8mg/L to&#13;
              4mg/L. In the base case, the linear reduction from 7.5mg/L to 3mg/L, while for the least effect, the linear reduction from 6mg/L to 2mg/L.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              In Vietnam, the Government has stipulated a Vietnamese standard on fresh-water quality for protection of aquatic&#13;
              lives with the acceptable level of DO is 5 mg/L. These standards define the limits of water parameters and permitted&#13;
              concentrations of pollutants for the protection of aquatic lives (Annex Table D9).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              In order to assess likely impacts of polluted water on fish production, geographical locations of the principal fish&#13;
              catches and water quality indicators are matched for major selected inland water bodies. Based on the observed&#13;
              DO levels in these water bodies, the function in Figure 4 is applied that estimates the loss of fish catch due to lower&#13;
              than optimal levels of dissolved oxygen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              The current fish production levels are adjusted upwards to predict what the fish catch would be in the presence of&#13;
              optimal DO levels, using the equation shown in Annex B.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              As explained earlier, it is assumed that there are 2 regional groups in Vietnam with different DO levels. The first&#13;
              group (Red River Delta and South East) with DO level of about 6 mg/L is assumed to operate at 70% of optimal&#13;
              DO level (Factor X = 70%). The second group (North East, North West, North Central Coast, South Central Coast,&#13;
              Central Highlands, Mekong River Delta) with higher DO level is assumed to operate at 90% of optimal value (Factor&#13;
              X=90%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Impact on fish reproduction and growth due to water pollution is assessed by spatially comparing actual yields&#13;
              under current pollution levels and potential yields under a situation of good water quality, based on a water quality&#13;
              ­ fish production function.&#13;

      Economic Impacts of Sanitation in Vietnam&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                        ANNEXES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The focus of the initial analysis is on fish production that is officially recorded in national statistics. Where fish catch&#13;
values are available, these are recorded; where not available, financial value is estimated by applying current market&#13;
prices to the average type of fish. The economic impact of low DO levels for non-recorded fish catch is also assessed,&#13;
by scaling up the financial values by proportion of total fish catch accounted for by non-recorded sources. This&#13;
was estimated as a factor of 1.1. Likewise for the economic estimates, the fish catch from subsistence fishing was&#13;
also estimated; and the nutritional importance discussed. Since the fish catch region is based on the geographic&#13;
location, it is hard to match the fish catch with the specific water bodies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To estimate attributable impact to poor sanitation, a proportion of this loss is assigned to sewage and domestic gray&#13;
water, as compared to other sources of water pollution (industry, agriculture, silt/natural erosion). This is done by&#13;
estimating the proportion of BOD from these different sources. Due to the lack of reliable information on proportion&#13;
of BOD from poor sanitation, it is assumed that poor sanitation contributes 40% of BOD to the water body.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A2.2.3 Water quality and domestic uses of water&#13;
In addition to the uses of surface and groundwater sources for domestic use, industrial use, fisheries and agriculture,&#13;
water is an essential ingredient to many other human and non-human activities [103]. In this present study, it is not&#13;
possible to conduct an exhaustive analysis of all the different uses of water. However, the following three categories&#13;
were assessed for relevance:&#13;
       · Non-commercial household (domestic) activities&#13;
       · Leisure activities [104]&#13;
       · Wildlife, covering flora and forna and animal species.&#13;
&#13;
Non-commercial activities are concentrated at the household level, and include water for cooking purposes,&#13;
washing clothes and kitchenware, and personal hygiene. Also, some traditional customs as well as leisure activities&#13;
are closely related to water. Again, some of these require good quality water given it will be ingested, while others&#13;
do not require quality water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Activities affected by below standard water quality were assessed in the following way:&#13;
    · Proportion of households and population that use untreated or unprotected surface or ground water for&#13;
          cooking, washing and bathing; and those that treat water to make it cleaner for domestic use. About 84%&#13;
          of rural households boil water before drinking. Red River Delta, North Central Coast and the low-lying&#13;
          provinces of the Northeast are regions with the highest rates. In the North West, South Central Coast,&#13;
          Central Highlands and South East, from 20% to 25% of households do not boil water before drinking. About&#13;
          35% of households in the Mekong do not boil water before drinking [30]. Results from the GSO survey also&#13;
          indicate that regular filtration or chemical disinfection of drinking water is practiced by only a small fraction&#13;
          of the population. Some households commonly use aluminum sulphate to remove the particulate matter&#13;
          and help remove microbial pathogens [105].&#13;
    · Proportion of households and population that switch water source due to the preference to have clean&#13;
          water for domestic activities. For example, for laundry and bathing, purchased water (via pipe or vendor)&#13;
          may be used rather than using local water bodies.&#13;
    · Extent of other cultural and leisure activities related to water, and that require water of a minimum quality&#13;
          standard, including swimming.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                 has 9 people with 6 working in the business, and the demand for water is high. To reduce expenditure, they&#13;
                 pump water from the canal into a storage tank where it is cleansed using alum. This source of water is used for&#13;
                 bathing, washing, etc. The clean water from the piped scheme is only used for cooking.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 For rice wine production, they use the cleansed river water to wash the rice, and then use water from the piped&#13;
                 scheme during the fermentation process. This cuts costs quite significantly.&#13;

              Wildlife is dependent on water resources. For plants and trees, much of the water need is met from rainfall, and&#13;
              hence the issue of pollution does not come in. For some plants and trees, and most animals and water creatures,&#13;
              they are reliant on standing water, and hence can be affected by water polluted from the different human sources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              According to the MONRE statistics, Vietnam now has about 700 species of flora and fauna under the threat of&#13;
              extinction. Many wildlife species listed in the Red book, including tigers, rhinoceros, reptiles and especially fresh&#13;
              water tortoises, were on the verge of extinction, along with precious fauna like aloe wood and ngoc linh ginseng.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Exploitation of marine resources and wildlife, destruction of forests, expansion in construction and pollution are&#13;
              seriously threatening the country's natural resources, including bio-diversity that is vital for the country as well as for&#13;
              the flora and fauna.&#13;
              Although it is not possible to determine the contribution of poor sanitation to the deterioration of wildlife, improved&#13;
              sanitation and less polluted water resources will certainly contribute to the protection of bio-diversity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              A3 Environment&#13;
&#13;
              The release of waste into the environment has other effects besides water pollution, given the unpleasant smells&#13;
              emanating from feces, urine, and other waste products [106, 107]. In countries where open defecation and unofficial&#13;
              dumping of waste are common, the quality of land is affected, rendering it unattractive and unusable for productive&#13;
              use. Unregulated waste dumping presents a threat to those disposing of waste, those living in the vicinity of the&#13;
              dumping area, as well as the poorest of the poor who often live off the waste (e.g. recycling activities).Waste grounds&#13;
              are also inhabited by stray dogs or other animals, which are diseased and pose a threat to human health. Even where&#13;
              there is a private or public agency taking care of disposal, it is often not performed according to plan. In cities, waste&#13;
              carts stay on the streets for many days, with resulting smell and unsightliness for local inhabitants and tourists.These&#13;
              aesthetic aspects of sanitation cause a loss of welfare for those coming into contact with the waste. However, given&#13;
              the lack of available data on these aspects, there is considerable uncertainty on the overall importance of these&#13;
              impacts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              A3.1 Aesthetics&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Aesthetics is not strongly related to productivity or income. Economic evaluation studies do not usually quantify&#13;
              aesthetics such as smell and sight in economic terms. Instead these aspects are described as a potential additional&#13;
              benefit provided by sanitation programs. Studies assessing user preferences for sanitation options, including&#13;
              willingness to pay studies, tend to limit the focus to the physical boundaries of the household, and hence not assess&#13;
              impacts on the broader environment [108, 109]. Hence, findings aesthetics benefits of improved sanitation in this&#13;
              study are presented mainly in qualitative terms.&#13;

A.3.2 Land quality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
When it has alternative uses, land is a tradable commodity. Hence, land that is used for improper, unofficial disposal&#13;
of waste will be unusable for other more productive uses, and hence will reflect an economic loss to society. This&#13;
present study assesses the solid waste management practices and resulting effects on land availability and land&#13;
quality, and presents economic value using an economic value of land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Solid waste management can be classified by safe and unsafe disposal practices. Unsafe practices involve open&#13;
dump and semi-controlled dump with limited or no environmental control. Engineered landfill is a safe practice&#13;
with basic waste accounting and some environmental control. The safest practice is sanitary landfill where waste&#13;
accounting is practiced, waste placement, fencing and staff onsite, regular environmental monitoring and leachate&#13;
collection and treatment. No waste pickers are allowed to work on a sanitary landfill [7].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
If a landfill or dump is not sanitary, it is necessary that a "buffer zone" is established surrounding its operational&#13;
portion.The distance in meters from the fence of a landfill to the nearest house is the buffer zone required to prevent&#13;
the household from having seriously negative impact from waste. Within this buffer zone, land areas become&#13;
temporarily unusable for other purposes, for example for constructing buildings, for agricultural use or for children's&#13;
play areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The study estimated the amount of land that has been rendered temporarily unusable or unproductive for other&#13;
uses for all unsanitary landfills in Vietnam as a result of unexpected buffer zones. A buffer zone was estimated to&#13;
extend for 1,000 m around an unsanitary landfill. The number of landfills and their areas by regions were from&#13;
Vietnam Environment Monitor 2004 and the Ministry of Construction data.&#13;

Once the actual surface area of land affected was quantified, it is multiplied by an estimated rental value for the&#13;
affected land (per square meter per year). The value taken was the rental of agricultural land, that is the lowest&#13;
one among different. It is assumed at VND 10,000 per m2 which is the standard land rental price regulated by the&#13;
government.&#13;

              A4 Other welfare&#13;
&#13;
              The type of sanitation facility a household has will have a range of impacts on population welfare. An important&#13;
              but difficult to quantify aspect is welfare impact on individuals and families who use a sub-standard, uncomfortable&#13;
              latrine or who have no latrine at all. Except for the disease impact (covered elsewhere), these less tangible aspects of&#13;
              human welfare have limited direct financial implications, but can be quantified as welfare losses using conventional&#13;
              economic techniques. More tangible impacts of sub-standard latrine or no facilities are time impacts due to&#13;
              journeying time or waiting due to insufficient shared or public latrines per head of population, security aspects&#13;
              of having no latrine or a remotely located one, especially for women and girls, as well as life decisions such as&#13;
              schooling or choice of employment, which may be linked to the presence of sub-standard or no latrines at schools&#13;
              and workplaces.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              A4.1 Intangible user preferences&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              User preferences which could be described as`intangible'­ or difficult to quantify ­ include:&#13;
                     · Comfort &amp; acceptability­ the acceptability of the squatting or seating position; the ease to perform&#13;
                            personal hygiene functions; the freedom from rushing to complete toilet-going due to unhygienic latrine&#13;
                            conditions, flies and foul smelling air and pressure from other users.&#13;
                     · Privacy and convenience ­ the benefits of not being seen using the toilet; or being seen walking to access&#13;
                            toilet facilities (women) [20].&#13;
                     · Security ­ the location of the latrine within or near to the home means that excursions to the outdoor&#13;
                            do not need to be made for toilet-going needs, in particular at night, where there may be dangers (theft,&#13;
                            attack, rape, and injuries sustained from dangerous animals or snakes).&#13;
                     · Conflict ­ on-plot sanitation can avoid conflict with neighbors or the community, where tensions exist on&#13;
                            the shared facilities, or fields and rivers for open defecation.&#13;

              according to the various aspects listed above (lack of comfort, lack of privacy, security threats, and conflict potential).&#13;
              It indicates that more than 2 million households do not have toilets. More than 3 million households have to share&#13;

or waiting time for shared latrine, and is estimated as shown in the algorithms in Annex B.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As there is no secondary information on this issue inVietnam, the study assumes 10 minutes as an average additional&#13;
daily time a person spends to find a private place for defecation. It is assumed that people who share latrines spend&#13;
15 more additional minutes per day for the same purpose.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The financial loss is estimated based on a proportion of adults whose time loss reflects a income loss, while the&#13;
economic loss is based on the entire population and the average unit of time value for each population group&#13;
(children time value is worth 50% of adult time value).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A4.3 Impact on life decisions and behavior&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Running water supply and sanitary latrines in schools are a luxury in most of the developing world, and in many&#13;
workplaces latrines are unhygienic, poorly maintained, and do not cater for special needs of women. The presence&#13;
of hygienic and private sanitation facilities in schools has been shown to affect enrolment and attendance, especially&#13;
for girls [16, 110]. Good latrine access at the workplace has implications for women participation at traditionally&#13;
male-dominated employment areas. Furthermore, sanitary and adequate latrines in schools and at workplaces not&#13;
only affect participation rates, but it also improves welfare of all pupils and employees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Given the complex web of causative factors and eventual life decisions, and the many factors determining&#13;
absenteeism from school or the workplace, it becomes difficult to quantify the exact relationship between poor&#13;
sanitation conditions, education and work decisions, and eventual economic outcomes. Furthermore, there is no&#13;
study on this issue in Vietnam so far. Hence, a number of assumptions on causal relationship have been made.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Annex Table A28 shows the results from a national survey in 2006 on the situation of toilets and running water in&#13;
schools and public places. It indicates that the number of schools with adequate latrines is just between 50% and&#13;
60%, while there are still 19.9% of primary schools and 7.4% of secondary schools that do not have toilets. On the&#13;
other hand, the problem of running water is less serious. There is no data on the coverage of toilets in workplaces.&#13;

                     1.     School absenteeism: a proportion of pupil absentee days is apportioned to lack of sanitation. The study&#13;
                            estimated the number of pupils not enrolling or falling out of school due to poor sanitation assuming&#13;
                            sanitation accounts for 2% of the total drop-out and absenteeism in schools. The number of absentee days&#13;
                            is assumed at 10 days per pupil per year. As explained earlier, children's time is estimated at 50% of adults'&#13;
                            time.&#13;
                     2.     Employment absenteeism. For those people in workplaces with no or inadequate latrines, the number of&#13;
                            days lost from work is assumed at 10 days per person per year. 1% of absentee days are apportioned to lack&#13;

              Tourists are sensitive to their environment, and are less likely to choose destinations which are dirty or where the risk&#13;
              of disease is high. Countries may be losing tourist revenues due to the degraded environment and high infectious&#13;
              disease rates among the general population, as well as actual or perceived health risks to tourists. Hence any initiative&#13;
              to attract more tourists to a country will need to consider the part sanitation plays in this [17-19].&#13;

              A5.1 Tourism and sanitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Tourism is a booming industry, and continues to experience double-digit growth in many developing countries&#13;
              around the world [112], fuelled by cheapening airfare costs coupled with the realization of developing country&#13;
              governments and private sector of the potential economic benefits of tourism. Tourism is playing an important&#13;
              role in boosting the revenues of governments as well as contributing to much-needed economic growth in the&#13;
              developing world.&#13;
              However,somecountrieshavedonebetterthanothersatexploitingthegrowthintourism.Touristpreferencesclearly&#13;
              play a key role in this: there are clearly many factors that determine tourists'choice of destination, and sanitation will&#13;

be one among many. Tourist growth depends on what the country can offer such as tourist transport infrastructure,&#13;
quality of accommodation and restaurants, type of experience offered (culture, climate, culinary, relaxation), and&#13;
safety. Also, prices of tourist services determine the relative attractiveness of a country for foreign tourists, which is&#13;
partially determined by the stability and level of the local currency. In addition to these factors, the present study&#13;
presents the hypothesis that there are important but under-recognized links between tourism and sanitation. Two&#13;
different sets of economic impacts are assessed in this study: (1) the sub-optimal exploitation of tourism potential&#13;
in the country, which is partially related to poor sanitation; and (2) the estimated costs to tourists associated with&#13;
health episodes and welfare losses resulting from poor sanitation. However, to avoid potential double-counting of&#13;
disease episodes of domestic tourists, and to avoid including welfare losses of foreign tourists in national estimates,&#13;
the second impact above is not included in the total cost estimates of poor sanitation in section 3.1.&#13;

Tourists are often heavily influenced in their choice of destination by the availability of information (positive media)&#13;
on a destination, the offer of package tours or package deals in their home country, and/or the ease of booking&#13;
flights and hotels on the internet or by phone. Hence there is a self-reinforcing loop, which can ­ over time ­ lead&#13;
to large resort complexes and tourist destinations such as the various coasts and islands of Southern Europe and&#13;
the Caribbean, coastal areas of Thailand and Malaysia, and well known tropical islands (Zanzibar, Maldives), among&#13;
others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
What role does sanitation play in a country's attractiveness for tourists? The environment is one of the key attracting&#13;
elements of a tourist destination ­ as a popular refrain goes: "sun, sea and sand" ­ which are recognized factors&#13;
for attracting tourists. But if the sea is brown from the pollution released by the country's rivers, if the sand or&#13;
roadsides are soiled with the excreta of the local inhabitants, and if food preparation standards are low, then the&#13;
tourism potential of a location is clearly limited [113].Tourist perceptions about the sanitary conditions of a potential&#13;
tourist destination are gathered from their own research and experience, as well as from the stories and perceptions&#13;
circulating via travel agencies and social networks. Important aspects for sanitary conditions to tourists include, but&#13;
are not limited to:&#13;
           · Aesthetics of the local environment (sight, smell)&#13;
           · Cleanness of water for swimming or sightseeing&#13;
           · Availability of clean latrines and water, soaps and towels for personal hygiene, in accommodation,&#13;
                 restaurants, bus stops etc.&#13;

&#13;
              According to the GSO statistics in 2005, 85% of foreign tourists express no interest in returning to Vietnam, which&#13;
              questions the sustainability of tourism development in Vietnam [114]. There are many reasons, and sanitation is one&#13;
              of those addressed by some stakeholders in Vietnam.&#13;

                 According to an article on Thanh Nien Newspaper on 11 June 2004: one of three major reasons for tourists not&#13;
                 returning to Vietnam is inadequate toilets. "There are many terribly dirty public toilets in Vietnam. I can say for&#13;
                 sure that as long as public toilets are not improved, Vietnam cannot attract more tourists from abroad. Under&#13;
                 current situation, there is no surprise that tourists would be afraid of returning to Vietnam."&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
              The situation is mainly due to the lack of public toilets inVietnam. In many places, including tourist attractions, toilets&#13;
              are very dirty and poorly maintained. Toilets even do not exist in some tourist areas.&#13;

              A5.2 Estimation of tourist losses due to poor sanitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Hence, while it is accepted that the standard of tourist facilities in Vietnam are improving over time, this present&#13;
              study assumes, based on evidence, that the sanitary standards remain sub-optimal. Hence, it is hypothesized that&#13;
              Vietnam could attract more tourists now and in the future: one of the aspects that must improve for that to happen&#13;
              is hygiene and sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Given the limited options for countries to boost tourist numbers and hotel occupancy rates from improved sanitation&#13;
              in the near-term, the tourist losses are not estimates as a financial cost. However, in the longer term it is assumed&#13;
              that study countries can not only increase the hotel occupancy rates under the existing capacity constraints of&#13;
              tourist infrastructure (airport, hotels, internal transport, restaurants), but also to expand the tourist infrastructure&#13;
              as well as making tourist destinations more attractive for tourists to accommodate significantly increased foreign&#13;
              tourist arrivals. Infrastructure requirements were based on mid- to long-term government targets for tourist growth&#13;
              and total numbers; where these were not available, realistic assumptions are made of the tourist growth achievable&#13;
              over a five year period until 2010. A target occupancy rate of 90% is assumed; this rate does not necessarily reflect&#13;
              the actual future occupancy rates expected, but enables an assumption of increased tourist flow (which may be&#13;
              partially accommodated by increased tourist capacity, hence occupancy stays below 90%). The attribution factor to&#13;
              poor sanitation is assumed to be 5%.This means that 1/20th of the low existing exploitation of tourists is due to poor&#13;
              sanitation, the other 19/20ths being accounted for by other infrastructural and environmental factors. The values&#13;
              used presented in following table.&#13;

experience in itself, it also eats into valuable holiday time, and may incur some expenses related to treatment. In&#13;
the worst case, the return journey of the tourist is affected or they need to get emergency transport. The financial&#13;
costs were estimated based on the estimated disease incidence and an assumed cost per episode. The economic&#13;
cost is estimated by adding an estimated"welfare loss"from days sickness to the financial cost of sickness treatment.&#13;
The welfare loss is approximated by the average holiday spending per day multiplied by the average length of&#13;
incapacitation. However, it is noted that to make national estimates of economic impact of poor sanitation, losses of&#13;
foreign tourists are excluded from the presentation of costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The General Statistics Office ofVietnam conducted a survey in 2005 to assess the health expenditures of both foreign&#13;
and local tourists. On average, a foreign tourist spends US$1.1 per day on health care, while a Vietnamese tourist in&#13;
Vietnam spends US$0.29 [114]. The study conservatively assumes that 20% of travelers' diarrhea is caused by poor&#13;
hygiene and sanitation. An average length of episode is assumed at 3 days. The algorithm is shown in Annex B.&#13;

&#13;
The financial and economic gains from improved sanitation and hygiene will be a proportion of the total losses&#13;
estimated for diseases associated with poor sanitation and hygiene.The proportion of costs avertable will depend on&#13;
theexpectedeffectivenessoftheinterventionsemployedtopreventdisease.Nohealthintervention,asimplemented&#13;
in practice, will be 100% effective in reducing the overall loss. However, sanitation and hygiene interventions have&#13;
been proven to be effective in a number of field trials [115, 116]. Given that good quality epidemiological studies are&#13;
limited in number, and have already been reviewed in previous meta-analyses, no additional country-level studies&#13;
were used to estimate disease cases prevented. Hence the estimates of intervention effectiveness are based on the&#13;
international literature, which includes the most up-to-date reviews on effectiveness [115-118].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The latest and most authoritative review by Fewtrell et al (2005) presented summaries of effectiveness from a meta-&#13;
analysis of field trials on water, sanitation and hygiene separately, as well as together [116]. The reader is referred to&#13;
the paper for details of individual studies. Table A32 below shows the summary of the meta-analysis.&#13;

These relative risk reductions are used to estimate expected rates of diarrhea under a situation of basic improved&#13;
sanitation and hygiene practices, and carried through to estimation of health care cost, productivity and income,&#13;
and premature deaths. Hence, based on the literature, the following reductions of disease incidence are predicted:&#13;

              Note however that hygiene and sanitation interventions implemented together will not have the sum of the&#13;
              individual effects. The literature does not provide evidence for the proposition that two interventions are more&#13;
              effective than one. This point needs to be taken into account in interpreting the estimations of economic loss&#13;
              avoided from health interventions.&#13;

              Given that the attributed costs of poor domestic sanitation have been estimated, the effect of improving sanitation&#13;
              will be the full losses, assuming that the interventions are fully effective in isolating human waste (at least in its&#13;
              harmful form) from the environment. In other words, by removing totally the pollution source, the economic losses&#13;
              will no longer be incurred. This is true for water resources, land resources, user preferences and tourism. However, for&#13;
              some environmental effects where the environment has been degraded considerably over time, there will also need&#13;
              to be expenditure on a clean-up operation to bring the land and water resources back to usable or fully productive&#13;
              condition. These costs are not estimated in this present study.&#13;

              Economic impacts and with effects up the supply chain (multiplier effect), will be for small local entrepreneurs&#13;
              as well as larger, non-local companies. There is also a potential for improving livelihoods of poor people through&#13;
              sanitation programs, largely through health improvement and employment generation [20].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Given the needs of sanitation programs for human labor and materials, sanitation programs will have a number of&#13;
              economic effects, whether it be for small local entrepreneurs or larger companies. Table A33 presents the unit costs&#13;
              of different sanitation options. These unit costs reflect the cost per household per year. Financial costs are made up&#13;
              of purchased services (labor, materials, equipment), while economic costs also include non-purchased inputs to the&#13;
              sanitationoption(suchashouseholdandcommunity-providedlabor).Thesearemultipliedbytheexpectedcoverage&#13;
              with different sanitation options to estimate total potential market values. These sanitation improvement option&#13;
              figures are from a survey on the interest of people in a new latrine. [119]. Since not all households can afford a new&#13;
              latrine, the study assumes 30% and 1% of total households in the rural and urban areas with unimproved sanitation&#13;
              respectively will invest in new toilets. While on the one hand this reflects community and household spending, it&#13;
              represents an economic gain for those involved in providing the services and will have broader economic effects.&#13;

the use of chemical and mineral fertilizers, especially taking into account the fact that some fossil resources are in&#13;
increasingly short supply (e.g. phosphorous). Alternatively, families with livestock may instead invest in a biogas&#13;
reactor, which provides biofuel for cooking, space heating and can even be used for lighting where other improved&#13;
sources (electricity) are not available [121].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The reuse of human waste for fertilizer or biogas production cannot be assumed to be population-wide, given&#13;
cultural attitudes towards handling and re-use of human waste, and low practical feasibility in many locations.&#13;
Success often depends on local perceptions of the expected returns on re-use of human waste, whether it be for&#13;
biogas or fertilizer. This study assumes this proportion as the number of households re-using human and animal&#13;
feces for both biogas and fertilizer purposes. The study estimates fecal weight per year and volume of gas produced,&#13;
and the economic value using existing market prices for these products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the above, biogas can bring other benefits to the country.The reductions in greenhouse gas emissions&#13;
from biogas activities are eligible to receive"carbon credits"under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the&#13;
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. These credits can be sold in the international market,&#13;
resulting in revenues for the country. Each biogas tank is equivalent to 2 credits that can be sold at 6 Euro each.&#13;
According to the biogas project (MARD and SNV), their biogas can bring about 1.8 million Euro per year from 150,000&#13;
biogas tanks. However, due to lack of reliable data, this present study does not include this benefit in total economic&#13;
impact of improved sanitation.&#13;

In terms of a market for the outputs from solid waste, the market for recyclables has a large potential for expansion.&#13;
32% of municipal waste currently placed in disposal sites in urban areas in Vietnam, or 2.1 million tons per year,&#13;
consist of commercially recyclable materials such as paper, plastic, metal and glass [7].This additional recycling could&#13;
result in a substantial reduction in disposal costs and allow the sector to earn considerable additional revenue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Composting also has high potential in Vietnam as there is a high proportion of organic matter in municipal wastes.&#13;
Composting can result in reduction of disposal costs and production of a marketable soil conditioner for use in&#13;
agriculture and by the public. With the development of a strong market for composting fertilizer and successful&#13;
source separation, the effectiveness of centralized composting facilities could increase considerably. Composting&#13;
can also reduce landfill gas emission, which can result in revenues for the country from selling carbon credits under&#13;
the Clean Development Mechanism (see above).&#13;

               A7 Uncertainty analysis&#13;
&#13;
               Tables A35 and A36 provide alternative input values to reflect data uncertainty in the present study:&#13;
               (1)       Uncertainty in the estimation of overall impacts, such as in the epidemiological and economic variables&#13;
                         (Table A35).&#13;
               (2)       Uncertainty in the attribution of the overall impact to poor sanitation (Table A36).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Table A35 presents a selection of uncertain economic variables, and the alternative ­ low and high values ­ used&#13;
               in the one-way sensitivity analysis. The selection of basis for lower and upper values of hourly time valued varies by&#13;
               country, due to GDP per capita being higher than compensation of employees in some countries (e.g. Philippines),&#13;
               and lower in others (e.g. Cambodia). The hourly productive time of children was varied from zero to the full adult&#13;
               value. Fish production impact was varied according to the lower and upper bounds presented in Figure A1 (section&#13;
               A3.2.2).&#13;

            Economic impacts of sanitation in Vietnam :
            a five-country study conducted in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao
            PDR, the Philippines, and Vietnam under the Economics of
            Sanitation Initiative (ESI)
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Vietnam, like other countries of Asia,
            is on a development path that is lifting large numbers of
            people out of poverty and improving access to goods and
            services that improve quality of life. Vietnam has done well
            so far in achieving significant development gains,
            especially in terms of poverty reduction. However, some
            aspects of development are being forgotten in the race to
            economic progress, affecting especially the vulnerable and
            low income groups. Sanitation is one such neglected aspect
            of development. In places where the public purse is severely
            limited and population needs seemingly boundless, sanitation
            is not deemed attractive or important enough to gain the
            attention of politicians or journalists. It is often seen as
            a private matter to be handled by the household or local
            community, and something that results from economic
            development rather than being seen as a precondition for
            economic development. Also, institutionally, sanitation is
            sidelined by lack of clear ministerial responsibilities.
            This study examines the major health, water, environmental,
            tourism, and other welfare impacts associated with poor
            sanitation. By examining the economic impacts of poor
            sanitation, and the potential gains from improved
            sanitation, this study provides important evidence to
            support further investments in sanitation.
