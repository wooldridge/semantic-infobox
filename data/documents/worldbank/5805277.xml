&#13;
Conventional project Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E)                 of community selection to find out where problems arose.&#13;
&#13;
systems do not usually capture these critical project                A variety of methods were used to collect information&#13;
&#13;
processes. Conventional M&amp;E systems focus on inputs                  about this critical process; participant observation, focus&#13;
&#13;
and outputs (physical and financial) as they relate to pre-          group discussions, semi-structured interviews and&#13;

defined project targets, staffing levels and expenditure.            discussions, among others.&#13;

These systems, while they provide information to key&#13;
decision-makers, do not look at decision-making itself as&#13;

they were intended to.                    these communities were willing to pay&#13;
                                          a higher share of the costs.                     the shortcomings of mobilizing&#13;

                                          A second finding which emerged from              structured surveys covering the&#13;
Using Process                             the PM process was that there was                entire community were exclusively&#13;
Monitoring to Solve the                   a second set of problems created by lack         used to determine priorities. This&#13;
Drop-out Problem                          of clarity of project rules and the              method, while recording the views&#13;

                                          Project staff and community members.&#13;
An important issue which emerged                                                           interviewed, was not adequate in&#13;

surprisingly high number of                                                                which required sometimes complex&#13;

tended to see the problem as one                                                           of information to be dominated by&#13;

departments who were supposed to plan and deliver&#13;
services.                                                            Through the findings of PM, it was recommended that the&#13;
                                                                     mobilization process be changed to focus on smaller groups&#13;
But was this the whole story? Why were so many                       such as neighborhoods, and that more participatory methods&#13;
communities failing to meet selection criteria? Was it               be used in interacting with communities.&#13;
because of the criteria, the process by which the criteria&#13;
were being communicated to communities, or something                 Another problem "discovered" by PM was the lack of&#13;
else?                                                                continuous and frequent contact with communities, due to&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
development staff. Delays in project implementation due&#13;
to lengthy government procedures, coupled with sporadic             Problems due to Project Procedures&#13;
and at times non-existent contact with the Project resulted&#13;
in communities losing interest. This problem was highlighted&#13;
to project management, who took steps to improve staffing           An important problem disclosed through PM was the&#13;
&#13;
and logistic arrangements.                                          lengthy, bureaucratic procedures which resulted in loss&#13;
                                                                    of the community's interest and confidence in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Key Lessons&#13;
  ·      Clearly stated project rules and proper understanding of these rules (selection criteria, rules for scheme&#13;
         identification and prioritization) by both Project staff and communities and the correct application of these&#13;
         rules, are essential ingredients of project success. Problems posed by both inadequate or inappropriate&#13;
         understanding of rules, and the rigidity of the rules themselves, negatively affected the Project. For example,&#13;
         inflexible rules regarding the ratios of primary, secondary and tertiary infrastructure (i.e. community infrastructure&#13;
         and primary systems) allowed, prevented the Project from responding to communities who were willing to&#13;
         contribute more than required for a different mix of infrastructure. A community might demand a greater&#13;
         amount of primary infrastructure for example, and be willing to pay a greater percentage of the capital cost&#13;
         (than 20 percent) for corresponding community infrastructure. Thus an opportunity to introduce an element&#13;
         of competition between communities was lost because of rigid project rules.&#13;
&#13;
  ·      Coordination and complementarity between social and technical assessments is critical for project success.&#13;
         The quality of social mobilization has important repercussions for scheme identification and selection, and&#13;
         community development units in the Project need to be properly staffed and functional.&#13;
&#13;
  ·      To prevent loss of credibility due to delays in physical implementation resulting from lengthy government&#13;
         procedures, these procedures must be streamlined. Communities must be effectively and sufficiently motivated,&#13;
         well aware and clear about rules and the terms of the partnership, obligations, and reasons for possible delays.&#13;
&#13;
  ·      Coordination and consistent policies and strategies are required between government line departments and&#13;
         projects to prevent duplication and wastage of resources and inconsistent messages to communities.&#13;
&#13;
  ·      An M&amp;E system should include process indicators and mechanisms for timely feedback to project management&#13;
         and identify remedial action to allow problems to be addressed at the right time.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                              Conclusion&#13;
AHMEDABAD:&#13;
A Case of Delays and Poor                                     Innovative, community-based projects must respond flexibly&#13;
Coordination                                                  and adapt to the varying demands generated during the&#13;
In Ahmedabad, the willingness to participate was so           community mobilization process. Very few projects start&#13;
high that both men and women met together to                  out as truly demand responsive and adaptive. This often&#13;
participate in the training organized by the Project,         has to be learned. Process Monitoring (PM) is a useful tool&#13;
not an insignificant occurrence in a gender-segregated        to enable projects to learn from themselves by identifying,&#13;
society.                                                      analyzing and communicating problems arising from the&#13;
&#13;
Paradoxically the Project later had to drop this              complex interactions between projects and communities.&#13;
&#13;
community due to loss of interest during the long wait&#13;
for things to happen. At the same time Public&#13;
Health Engineering Departmant (PHED), the                     In this case, PM helped the Project identify, understand&#13;
government line department responsible for water              and take action to address the root causes of a serious&#13;
supply, began a scheme in this community which                problem; drop-out of many communities after being initially&#13;
offered "softer" terms than the Project. This further         selected to participate in the Project. The actions taken by&#13;
undermined the communities' interest in participating         Project management as a result of information provided&#13;
in the Project. Had the CIP initiated its physical            through PM helped the Project to learn from its "mistakes",&#13;
implementation in a timely manner, the community              become more adaptive, and ultimately improve its&#13;
would not have turned to another department.&#13;
                                                              effectiveness in delivering appropriate infrastructure which&#13;
As a result of this finding, the Project started liaison      responded to communities' demands and it's willingness&#13;
with line departments and other programs and projects         to share costs.&#13;
in the same area. Reduction in duplication of services&#13;
and better coordination in selection of communities&#13;
resulted.&#13;

            Innovative, community-based projects
            must respond flexibly and adapt to the varying demands
            generated during the community mobilization process. Very
            few projects start out as truly demand responsive and
            adaptive. This often has to be learned. Process Monitoring
            (PM) is a useful tool to enable projects to learn from
            themselves by identifying, analyzing and communicating
            problems arising from the complex interactions between
            projects and communities.
