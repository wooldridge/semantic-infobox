Note No. 43   The Power of Collateral&#13;
How problems in securing transactions limit private credit for movable&#13;
property&#13;
He)woodFleisig    The first question any private loan officer is taught to ask is, "How do I get my money back?" Bor-&#13;
rowers have offered two broad answers to that question: giving an unsecured promise to pay, and&#13;
offering collateral that can be seized and sold by the lender if the borrower fails to pay. This Note&#13;
discusses the second type of borrowing. Drawing on several World Bank-supported projects, it sets&#13;
out how legal and regulatory constraints on using movable property as collateral limit access to&#13;
credit in many client countries. The problem is potentially severe. In industrial countries, movable&#13;
property-livestock, machines, inventory, equipment, standing crops-can represent as much as a&#13;
third of the capital stock and half of investment. Where borrowers cannot use this property as collat-&#13;
eral for loans, they must pay higher unsecured interest rates. Consequently, they hold less capital per&#13;
worker and produce less output per person. In Bolivia, the loss in GDP from an inadequate framework&#13;
for secured transactions is estimated at between 5 percent and 10 percent.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In many developing countries, faulty
            laws and regulations make it hard to use livestock,
            machines, equipment, standing crops, and other movable
            property as collateral. The resulting constraints on access
            to credit hurt economies. In Bolivia, for example, a faulty
            legal and regulatory framework for the use of movable
            property as collateral has led to a loss in GDP estimated at
            between 5 and 10 percent. The author explains the problem.
