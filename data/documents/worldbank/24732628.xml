(each a "Party" and together the "Parties").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad international recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Intern it cl al&#13;
Organizations (IOs), the G7-, and the private sector represented by the B20 that investing i i Ie&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed, to E :11 id&#13;
access to basic services anLJ raise living standards for all, and to meet global economic 1ir:, th&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need present:; a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on e :i01 ig&#13;
sources of infrastructure finnce-particularly in the public sector-a redoubled and coorc r al Ad&#13;
effort is needed to mobilize Frivate sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of robist pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects and :ii! is&#13;
understood to be the greateE t barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investme 'I&#13;
(D) Governments, development "inance institutions, donors, and private investors share an inte rs in&#13;
developing the market for p ivate infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand Ec e, in&#13;
the numbers of structurally s)und and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual eme g an :e&#13;
of EMDE infrastructure as a recognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range of :1  ; te&#13;
investors that actively participate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals will :,r fit&#13;
from collective action between this range of entities-to leverage resources and knowle:I1IE to&#13;
find solutions to complex nfrastructure financing challenges that no single institution (c Id&#13;
achieve alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, the Parties propose the establishment of a Global Infrastructure IE ci ty&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF" . The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at leveragil 11 ie&#13;
efforts of the wide range of nstitutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastructu = v th&#13;
the participation of private infrastructure investors, coalescing around project prepE ati n,&#13;
structuring, and  risk mitigaton for individual infrastructure investments. In this regard, tI ,  IF&#13;
aims to complement existing and proposed services and initiatives currently supported :) ie&#13;
Parties and other prospectiv ? GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prepar a w II-&#13;
structured, infrastructure projects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for accessi Ie&#13;
expertise of the Parties anc other GIF partners, in combination with guidance from prosI E c: ie&#13;
private sector financiers into project structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater le ( r; ge&#13;
of official resources in the face of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particular fa 31 ge&#13;
and complex projects with the potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;

Annex I&#13;
Preliminary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the 31F is to promote private sector investment in infrastructure prc it ch&#13;
in emerging markets and dev eloping economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparatio ,&#13;
provision of appropriate risk mitigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commercial , c&#13;
institutional investor engagement in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex pub ic-private partnerships and projects with potential for commerc a&#13;
viability which require project preparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastruc u &#13;
financing solutions that no siigle institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF aims to create a global platform to provide financial and coordii z ti: 1&#13;
resources in collaboration wi h the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of the 9  i&#13;
range of donor and development finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE&#13;
infrastructure, with the input and ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engagement c . d&#13;
stretch from upstream suppot on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to downstream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and risk&#13;
mitigation/credit enhancemei it.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer term, by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structured&#13;
infrastructure projects, the G F can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset class attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking long-t rni&#13;
assets in faster growing ecor omies, but which until now have been presented only limited&#13;
infrastructure investment opr ortunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profiles&#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to coerate according to the following core principles, to be finalizec p n&#13;
agreement among GIF partn 3rs:&#13;
(i) Leveraging the private sector-specializing in project financing modalities the :i&#13;
draw together cc mparative advantages of public and private sectors;&#13;
(ii) Addressing public goods-focusing on core infrastructure; particularly those&#13;
infrastructure projects that are climate friendly or trade enabling;&#13;
(iii) Promoting sustainability and inclusiveness-ensuring projects adhere to bE :&#13;
practice standaris for social and environmental responsibility; and&#13;
(iv) Collaborating, complementing and partnering for solutions-mobilizing tech'1i al&#13;
and financial resources of all partner entities-World Bank Group entities, multi a :E al&#13;
development institutions, other public institutions, and private investors-in an&#13;
innovative and flexible way, to complement existing capacities, achieve greater&#13;
leverage and address the complex infrastructure financing challenges that are&#13;
beyond the reso,irces of any individual partner.&#13;
3     Institutional Arrangements and Governance&#13;
3.1   The GIF is expected to involve a wide range of stakeholders who are involved in th!&#13;
development and implementation of infrastructure projects, both public and private. GIF par r e&#13;

(iii) Advisory Partntors-Private investors or entities that represent the voice of&#13;
commercial and/or institutional investment, whether pension funds, insurance&#13;
companies, sovereign wealth funds, banks or other financial institutions, as wel as&#13;
other multilatera or bilateral agencies engaged in supporting private sector&#13;
infrastructure projects, to be invited into discussions related to project preparati Ir,&#13;
optimal approaches to financial structuring, and the design and use of risk&#13;
instruments, witt a view to ensure suitability of projects for commercial and/or&#13;
institutional inve'-tment.&#13;
3.2   A GIF Governing Council is proposed to oversee the GIF's strategic programming&#13;
management and use of funds, and development of operational policies and procedures; ar d&#13;
hold the GIF Management U it (see section 4.1) accountable for delivering on the facility's&#13;
objectives and principles, witi advice and support from the Advisory Partners. The composi or &gt;f&#13;
the Governing Council will be agreed between IBRD and prospective partners, but is propo. -: 1&#13;
comprise representatives of -unding and Technical Partners.&#13;
3.3   An Advisory Council comprised of all GIF partners, chaired by the Managing Diretltr&#13;
and Chief Financial Officer o the World Bank Group, will be periodically convened to facilitz l(&#13;
coordination of GIF activities and support GIF operations. This Advisory Council will serve ei a&#13;
sounding board, providing gUidance and support for GIF Management, and in particular witi o&#13;
view to ensuring suitability of projects for private sector investment.&#13;
4     Management&#13;
4.1   The GIF will be adm nistered by the World Bank Group, through a small, dedicated Ea' I&#13;
established for this purpose the GIF Management Unit). The GIF Management Unit will fun:, i&#13;
as a coordinating body as pr!jects are identified for inclusion in the pipeline, and then move&#13;
toward technical support anc, financing phases. The GIF Management Unit will not lead indi ,i:li, l&#13;
projects.&#13;
4.2   GIF activity implementation teams will be led by selected staff of Technical Partner&#13;
institutions, coordinated by the GIF Management Unit in consultation with client governmen s&#13;
according to specific project requirements and the project origination processes. Composit :i f&#13;
the implementation teams may vary according to the need of individual projects and goverr nE ts.&#13;
5     Activities and Projects&#13;
5.1    Project selection c iteria and processes could be developed to reflect the followi i,&#13;
principles:&#13;
(i) Development Impact-projects that support the development goals of the GIF&#13;
partner institutio!is;&#13;
(ii) Alignment-projects that are aligned with recipient/sponsor country priorities e i:1&#13;
strategies;&#13;
(iii) Complexity-p ojects that require multiple parties to come together to provide&#13;
structuring, arra iging and financial support, and/or projects which require a ble ll :&#13;
financial instrurrents; and&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(iv) Catalytic Impact-projects that have significant potential to achieve financial v a:! :y,&#13;
leverage public finds, and attract private sector and/or institutional investors-EJ::&#13;
as through Publi,;-Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-while still meeting&#13;
government's se vice delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrastricture investments that have global public good characteristics R1 h&#13;
as climate friendly-project; that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provision if&#13;
infrastructure services; and t ade enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconneci v t&#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of suppcrt provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, with EiE ia&#13;
to complementing the resour !es and support already available from partner entities and oth :i&#13;
funding mechanisms. During the GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following acti i E&#13;
corresponding to major proje,-t development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; prcject definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility scre !r ir 1;&#13;
and legal, regulatory, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii) Project preparation and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and P P structuring;&#13;
(iii) Transaction support and financial structuring - preparing and implementing&#13;
transactions, and design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; and&#13;
(iv) Financial arrang ng and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing financing&#13;
packages from a range of sources and partners.&#13;
6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies-including in particular the management of environmental and s:i.i;&#13;
impacts and risks, and transparency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastruit ir&#13;
projects in supporting sustainable, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial, reputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supportec operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements fc r&#13;
external implementing entities under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an approach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards and :t&#13;
standards and policies, and develop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for GIF&#13;
Technical Partners who are oxpected to function as implementing entities for GIF activities.&#13;
