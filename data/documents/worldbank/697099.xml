Guarantor        : Republic of the Philippines&#13;
Beneficiaries       Investors   in   economic   rural   activities,   and   rural&#13;
populations&#13;
Poverty Category:  Not applicable&#13;
Amount           : US$150  million  equivalent  consisting  of  three  separate&#13;
loans    of  US$50  million  each:  (a)  Currency  Pool  Loan&#13;
(CPL/Loan A); (b) US dollar Single Currency Loan at Libor-&#13;
based  floating  rate  (VRSCL/Loan  B);  and  (c)  US  dollar&#13;
Single Currency Loan at fixed rate (FRSCL/Loan C).&#13;
Terms            : The CPL and VRSCL, would be for 20 years, including 5 years&#13;
of grace.   The FRSCL would be payable in 15 years with 3&#13;
years of grace and 12 years maturity on each disbursed&#13;
amount.    Loan A,  the  CPL,  would  be  lent  at  the  Bank&#13;
standard variable interest rate, Loan B, VRSCL, at the Bank&#13;
standard LIBOR-based variable interest rate for US dollar,&#13;
and Loan C, the FRSCL, at the Bank standard fixed interest&#13;
rate term for US dollar for 12 year maturity.&#13;
Commitment Fee  :  0.75% on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days after&#13;
signing, less waiver.&#13;
Relending Terms : The Land Bank of the Philippines  (LBP) would relend the&#13;
proceeds of the Bank loans: (i) to accredited participating&#13;
financial institutions (PFIs) in domestic currency under&#13;
the Currency Pool Loan (CPL) and in domestic currency or in&#13;
US dollars under the Single Currency Loan (SCL) options;&#13;
and (ii) to LBP's own clients jointly financed with other&#13;
financial institutions in domestic currency under the CPL&#13;
terms and in domestic currency or in US dollars under the&#13;
SCL options.   The  foreign  exchange  risk  for  small  and&#13;
medium sized sub-borrowers (with total assets up to Peso&#13;
250 million) would be borne by the Government in exchange&#13;
for a market related fee payable by LBP.   In other cases&#13;
the  foreign  exchange  risk  would  be  borne  by  the  sub-&#13;
borrowers. Interest rates charged by LBP to the PFIs would&#13;
be freely negotiated on the basis of: (i) a market&#13;
reference  rate  (the weighted  average  of  Treasury  Bills&#13;
rates for 90 days) for domestic currency lending; and (ii)&#13;
a LIBOR-based variable interest rate for US dollar lending&#13;
under  the  SCL  program.    Sub-loans  would  be  made  at&#13;
prevailing market interest rates. Sub-borrowers would be&#13;
given a choice of a fixed rate  (the prevailing variable&#13;
rate  plus  a premium)  for  several  years  or  a  variable&#13;
interest  rate  periodically  adjusted.        Maturity  would&#13;
conform to the maturities of sub-loans made by the PFIs and&#13;
LBP to sub-borrowers, but would not exceed 15 years.&#13;

I. THE ECONOMY&#13;
Overview&#13;
1.1       With a per capita GNP of US$970 (1994) and a population of over 68&#13;
million,  the  Philippine  archipelago  ranks  among  the  lower  middle-income&#13;
countries. Following a decade of relatively strong economic growth in the 1970s&#13;
(6% p.a.), the Philippine economy was severely affected by a recession during the&#13;
early 1980s. Beginning in 1980, and with renewed vigor following the change of&#13;
Government in 1986, the Philippine Government (GOP) embarked on an adjustment&#13;
program aimed at correcting a wide range of structural problems.   Reforms&#13;
undertaken in agricultural pricing and marketing, the financial sector,&#13;
investment incentives, direct and indirect taxation were accompanied by trade&#13;
liberalization and privatization.&#13;
1.2       Although these structural reforms led to an initial economic recovery&#13;
during the second half of the 1980s, the Philippines has largely failed to&#13;
sustain its economic growth.  While GDP grew at an average of 5.2% per annum&#13;
during the late 1980s, growth dropped to below 1% in 1990-93 before rising to&#13;
4.3% in 1994. Among the factors responsible for the sluggish performance of the&#13;
country's economy during these years were frequent macroeconomic policy slippage,&#13;
such as delayed Government response to revenue shortfalls and higher oil prices,&#13;
worries about future disruption of trade and capital flows due to high foreign&#13;
debt and public deficits, numerous external shocks, including a string of major&#13;
natural disasters during the early 1990s, political uncertainties and depressed&#13;
private investments.   Unlike in other countries which embarked on similar&#13;
adjustment programs, private sector response to adjustment was slow because of&#13;
deep-rooted oligopolies, low private savings and investment rates and continued&#13;
severe shortages in the power sector.&#13;
1.3       In  1991  the  Government  initiated  a  new  macroeconomic  program,&#13;
combining stabilization with renewed structural reform. Among the key reforms&#13;
undertaken during this period were substantial liberalization of foreign&#13;
investment, tariff reforms, deregulation of the foreign exchange market,&#13;
decentralization of fiscal and administrative powers from central to local&#13;
governments, and fiscal and monetary tightening to help improve macroeconomic&#13;
imbalances.   The reforms were accompanied by a comprehensive agreement to&#13;
restructure medium and long term foreign debt held by commercial banks and a&#13;
national action plan to address the crisis in the power sector. The successful&#13;
implementation of stabilization policies during the last three years has begun&#13;
to create an emerging track record of sound macro-economic management, while&#13;
other structural reforms have substantially contributed to correct major policy-&#13;
induced distortions, thus leaving the Philippines with a business environment&#13;
which compares favorably with that in neighboring countries. To sustain these&#13;
efforts in the years to come, further consolidation of reforms is required in&#13;
such areas as revenue generation, energy, transport and capital markets. In view&#13;
of the Government's limited capacity to finance development expenditures,&#13;
increased private sector investments will be essential over the years to come.&#13;
1.4       The Government's medium term development plan therefore focusses on:&#13;
(i) macroeconomic stability through continued tight management of financial&#13;
policies--in 1994, the consolidated public sector deficit was practically&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
eliminated, and inflation fell to 7%; (ii) enhancing the role of the private&#13;
sector through extending the successful privatization program and encouraging&#13;
private participation in infrastructure investments; (iii) an improved law and&#13;
order situation (iv) poverty alleviation through sustained growth as well as&#13;
targeted interventions; and (v) environmentally sustainable growth through&#13;
stronger preservation of natural resources, better control on air and water&#13;
pollution, reduced urban degradation and better protection of coastal waters and&#13;
fisheries.&#13;
Agriculture in the Economy&#13;
1.5       Sector Structure and Performance.   Agriculture continues to play a&#13;
significant role in the economy, both in terms of its direct contribution to&#13;
production and employment and as a basis for activities in the manufacturing and&#13;
service sectors.  During the first four years of the 1990s, agriculture's direct&#13;
contribution amounted to about 22% of GDP, agri-based industry accounted for&#13;
another 13%, while as much as one-third of value added in the service sector was&#13;
also linked to agriculture. Agriculture remains the most important source of&#13;
employment directly providing income to 45% of the labor force. Although the&#13;
sector's direct contribution to national output and employment has dropped&#13;
continuously over the past two decades, the pace of change has been remarkably&#13;
slow compared to other countries in the region. This slow structural shift is&#13;
a reflection of industry's failure to become the main engine of growth and&#13;
principal source of labor absorption over the last two decades.&#13;
1.6       Following a decline in output during the crisis years of the early&#13;
eighties, the agriculture sector recovered to grow at an average annual rate of&#13;
3%, contributing about 16% to domestic growth between 1985 and 1990. The early&#13;
1990s were characterized by stagnation in both agricultural output and value&#13;
added in agro-processing. The sectoral growth rate during the period of economic&#13;
recovery was below both growth in the rest of the economy and the sector's&#13;
comparatively strong performance during the 1970s. Sectoral value added,&#13;
agricultural exports, and food production per capita have lagged far behind those&#13;
in most other East and South Asian countries. Several factors account for this&#13;
slowdown, including the fact that the fruits of the green revolution had largely&#13;
been exploited by the end of the 1980s, an overall downward trend in&#13;
international commodity prices for the Philippines' traditional export crops,&#13;
natural  calamities,  and  a  series  of  macro-economic  and  sector  specific&#13;
impediments which have led to underinvestment in the sector. Among the latter&#13;
two figure an exchange rate that became overvalued in the late 1970s, the absence&#13;
of long term credit, deterioration of intersectoral terms of trade, weak rural&#13;
infrastructure and an inefficient transport system, feeble support services and&#13;
slow implementation of agrarian reform.&#13;
1.7       Rural Poverty.   Persistent widespread rural poverty is the most&#13;
disappointing aspect of past economic performance in the country.   Over two-&#13;
thirds of all poor households live in rural areas, where both the incidence and&#13;
the severity of poverty remain high.   The incomes of over half of all rural&#13;
households fall below the rural poverty line (US$230 in 1992) and the number of&#13;
rural poor households has increased by over 52% from 2.3 million to 3.5 million&#13;
between the mid-1960s and the late 1980s.  Several factors account for this,&#13;
including falling real wages, a continuing high population growth rate, an&#13;
increasing scarcity of land, inadequate growth of the agriculture sector and a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
failure of the economy as a whole to provide sufficient employment opportunities&#13;
outside  agriculture.    Sustained  sectoral growth,  combined  with  increased&#13;
employment opportunities outside the agriculture sector in rural areas will be&#13;
indispensable to reduce rural poverty in the years to come. The proposed project&#13;
would assist in achieving these goals through the provision of needed term&#13;
lending facilities for financing rural development activities.&#13;
1.8        Government Strategy and Outlook.  Aware of the critical role that&#13;
agriculture must play in economic recovery and in spearheading the attack on&#13;
rural poverty, the Government has implemented a series of institutional reforms&#13;
to stre-igthen sector management and policy reforms aimed at reducing government&#13;
interventions in pricing and marketing and at eliminating discrimination against&#13;
agriculture. It has also embarked on the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program&#13;
to achieve better distribution of cultivable lands and aims at increasing&#13;
allocation of public resources to agricultural development.  The Government's&#13;
sectoral objectives as stated in the Agricultural Development Plan (1990) are:&#13;
(i) to increase the productivity and real incomes of small farming and fishing&#13;
families; (ii) to attain self-sufficiency in rice and corn for food security;&#13;
(iii) to help attain a favorable balance of trade for the country; and (iv) to&#13;
help ensure productivity of the agricultural resource base over the longer term.&#13;
The focus of this broad plan has been refined under the Medium Term Agricultural&#13;
Development Plan 1993-98. During implementation of this, Government intends to&#13;
concentrate its efforts on the development of Key Production Areas (KPAs) which&#13;
it has defined for different crops. The KPA approach aims to achieve greater and&#13;
more diverse aggregate production as a result of increased specialization and&#13;
hence higher yields.   It recognizes that (i) prospects in the international&#13;
market for some of the Philippines' traditional exports (mainly sugar) appear&#13;
bleak; and (ii) the gains of the green revolution have been substantially reaped,&#13;
particularly for rice. Consequently, future sectoral growth will have to come&#13;
from increased diversification, intensification, and linkages between production&#13;
of raw materials and processing.   This new approach, which will result in&#13;
substantial changes in cropping pattern and increased commerce in agricultural&#13;
products, will require substantial sectoral investments by the private sector,&#13;
pointing up the need for adequate term financing.&#13;
1.9        With a planned agricultural growth rate of about 4%, and a similar or&#13;
higher rate aimed for in other rural businesses, incremental rural output over&#13;
the five year project disbursement period would amount to about P150 billion at&#13;
1994 prices.   Assuming Incremental Capital to Output Ratios  (ICORs) for the&#13;
sector of 3-4, the investment required to support this growth would be around&#13;
P450-600 billion or some US$20 billion. It is unlikely that more than 20% of&#13;
this would be provided by Government. Consequently, the majority of investment&#13;
would need to come from private investment of which a significant part would be&#13;
funded by formal borrowing.   Assuming private  investment is funded  50% by&#13;
retained profits, 25-% informal borrowing and 259% borrowing from banks, the&#13;
incremental formal credit required over the five year project period would amount&#13;
to about US$4 billion. The project would provide about 5% of this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. THE RURAL FINANCE SECTOR&#13;
Structure&#13;
2.1       The formal rural finance system in the Philippines is essentially&#13;
comprised of four types of institutions: (i) a relatively small number of&#13;
commercial banks with rural branches;  (ii)  thrift banks,  including private&#13;
development banks, savings and mortgage banks, and savings and loans&#13;
associations;  (iii)  family-owned  local  rural  banks  and;  (iv)  specialized&#13;
Government banks. The formal rural finance system is furthermore supported by&#13;
several government sponsored non-bank financial institutions which provide&#13;
guarantee  and insurance services  to agriculture.    The two most  important&#13;
institutions are the Quedan and Rural Credit Guarantee Corporation, known as the&#13;
QUEDANCOR, providing mainly warehouse guarantees, and the Philippine Crop&#13;
Insurance Corporation (PCIC) focussing on insurance of grain production.&#13;
2.2       Commercial banks have accounted for almost 64% of total loans granted&#13;
to agriculture between 1988-1994. However, their lending has essentially been&#13;
limited to highly collateralized loans granted to large local and multinational&#13;
agribusinesses. Although the bulk of their lending consists of short term loans,&#13;
these are often rolled over on a regular basis to large long term customers.&#13;
Commercial banks do not generally lend to small-scale rural borrowers, due to the&#13;
high costs and higher perceived risk involved.&#13;
2.3       Thrift  banks,  including  private  development  banks,  savings  and&#13;
mortgage banks, and savings and loans associations accounted for only 7.5% of&#13;
loans to agriculture in the last five years, with the bulk coming from private&#13;
development banks which are heavily concentrated in Central Luzon and have&#13;
generally relied on the funds of the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)&#13;
for term lending to medium-scale agri-based industries.&#13;
2.4       Rural Banks (RBs). Unlike commercial and thrift banks which tend to&#13;
mobilize more resources in rural areas than they invest there, RBs mostly&#13;
mobilize and reinvest resources in rural areas and have thus played a significant&#13;
role in the development of the rural economy. Their development throughout the&#13;
country was, however, largely spurred by heavily subsidized Government funds&#13;
(about P4.5 billion), which were made available through special deposits and&#13;
Central Bank rediscounting facilities for onlending to agriculture during the&#13;
1970s and early 1980s.   Under such programs,  more attention was given to&#13;
extending loans than to ensuring project viability,  repayment capacity and&#13;
collection.  As a result, over 80% of loans granted under such programs as the&#13;
Masagana-991 were never collected, leaving the majority of rural banks in&#13;
financial distress. The elimination of Government subsidies to rural banks in&#13;
1985 resulted in widespread closure of rural banks and left most of the remaining&#13;
institutions in a weak financial position.  Less than half of the over 1,100&#13;
rural banks which operated in 1981 are currently deemed viable enough to operate&#13;
or qualify for rehabilitation and only about 250 are still strong enough to&#13;
1/    Most RBs participated heavily in the Government-supported Masagana-99 (M-&#13;
99) agricultural credit program during 1973-81, which aimed to bring about&#13;
self sufficiency in rice production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
operate without external assistance. Although they still account for close to&#13;
30% of the banking sector's branch network, rural banks retain less than 3% of&#13;
the sector's total assets and have accounted for about 13% of loans granted to&#13;
agriculture over the last five years.&#13;
2.5       In 1987, the Government launched the second initiative to rehabilitate&#13;
rural banks, with a focus on encouraging the infusion of fresh capital by rural&#13;
bank owners against Central Bank support through a combination of arrears&#13;
conversion into Government equity and rescheduling of the remaining arrears into&#13;
a 15-year installment program. After five years of rehabilitation, the exposure&#13;
and management capacity as well as financial strength of many of the RBs have&#13;
been improved, however, about 230 (30%) of them remain weak, making them&#13;
ineligible for intermediation of Government loans in the rural areas.&#13;
2.6       Specialized Government Banks.   The role of specialized Government&#13;
banks in lending to agriculture dropped quite significantly between 1982-85, but&#13;
they have regained significant importance over the last five years, mainly due&#13;
to Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) aggressive expansion in agrarian lending.&#13;
Between 1988-94, Government banks accounted for about 20% of lending to&#13;
agriculture. Three specialized Government banks have traditionally extended&#13;
credit to the rural sector: the Philippines National Bank (PNB), the Development&#13;
Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and LBP. While PNB was partially privatized in&#13;
1992, DBP accounts for only a small share of lending to agriculture, leaving LBP&#13;
as the main player. In 1993 it accounted for over 14.5% of loans granted to&#13;
agriculture and was one of the only sources for sectoral term lending. While LBP&#13;
services medium and large scale rural enterprises through its commercial banking&#13;
operations, it has in the last seven years aggressively expanded its agrarian&#13;
operations which provide loans to small borrowers and agrarian reform&#13;
beneficiaries mainly through cooperatives.&#13;
Lending Structure&#13;
2.7       As Table 2.1 indicates, formal lending for agricultural production has&#13;
declined significantly over the past 10 years, in absolute terms, as a share of&#13;
total value added and particularly also as a share of total loans granted by the&#13;
banking sector. This decline is due essentially to two factors: the traditional&#13;
better lending opportunities for private banks, associated with higher revenue&#13;
(directly and indirectly) and lower credit risk, and a change in central bank&#13;
rediscount policy toward more sectoral balanced lending. Since the second half&#13;
of the 1980s, the composition of the agricultural loan portfolio has changed away&#13;
from loans for tree crops and sugar toward more loans for cereals and livestock&#13;
production; this change was brought about by high interest rates, an aversion to&#13;
term-lending and the reluctance of large land owners and private banks to further&#13;
invest in or lend against property which may be subject to agrarian reform.&#13;

Policy Reforms and Issues&#13;
2.8       Past Reforms.  During the 1980s, Government efforts to strengthen the&#13;
rural finance system and induce private banks to increase lending to agriculture&#13;
have focussed on: (i) interest rate reforms resulting in deregulation of deposit&#13;
and lending rates; (ii) greater reliance on market mechanisms to allocate&#13;
financial resources; (iii) reduced rural credit subsidies and Government direct&#13;
intervention; and (iv) institutional reforms in support of LBP as an apex&#13;
institution for rural credit and the rural bank rehabilitation efforts.&#13;
2.9       Outstanding Issues.   Despite the above measures to strengthen the&#13;
rural financial system, institutional lending to agriculture remains affected by&#13;
several factors, including (i) reluctance to lend to agriculture due to higher&#13;
risks; (ii) the requirement of urban collateral or relatively liquid commodity&#13;
assets; (iii) the lack of medium- and long-term financing particularly for rural&#13;
development; (iv) the weak financial condition of many rural banks which could&#13;
serve as financial intermediaries; (v) concentration of non-government bank&#13;
lending on large borrowers; (vi) continued proliferation of government non-&#13;
financial agencies supporting subsidized rural credit programs despite past&#13;
efforts to consolidate various funds under the Comprehensive Agricultural Loan&#13;
Fund, known as the CALF; and (vii) overemphasis on provision of credit, as&#13;
opposed to rural savings mobilization.&#13;
2.10      Necessary Reforms.   Besides measures at the macro level  (further&#13;
liberalization of prices and import) which would permit increased profitability&#13;
of rural production, further efforts to strengthen the rural financial system and&#13;
allow for increased participation in rural lending should focus on four main&#13;
areas: (i) removing remaining credit subsidies and thereby encouraging the&#13;
private sector to lend to agriculture on an equal footing with public&#13;
institutions; (ii) further rehabilitation of rural banks through private sector&#13;
initiative  and  indirect  government  support;   (iii)  strengthening  rural&#13;
cooperatives to permit them to serve as viable financial intermediaries; and (iv)&#13;
increasing efforts to streamline and consolidate government sponsored credit&#13;
programs, relying on banking institutions to carry them out.  These would be&#13;
supported by the proposed project through the institutional and policy reform&#13;
component and the provision of term lending facilities (paras. 3.2 and 3.9).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Land Bank of the Philippines&#13;
2.11      Mandate.  Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) was established in 1963&#13;
as the primary agency responsible for agrarian reform financing. Ten years later&#13;
its scope was substantially broadened and LBP was accorded full banking powers,&#13;
allowing it to receive deposits and engage in underwriting activities. At the&#13;
same time its capital was raised to P3 billion, with P1.8 billion common shares&#13;
that were finally paid up by Government in 1986, and P1.2 billion preferred&#13;
shares which have never been issued.&#13;
2.12      Although legislation between 1963 and 1987 clearly established LBP's&#13;
major role as financier of land reform, its activities until the late 1980s were&#13;
mainly outside the small farm sector, partly because of slow land reform&#13;
implementation. Since the enactment of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program&#13;
(CARP) in 1987, however, LBP has re-addressed itself to its legal priority of&#13;
providing support to the agrarian sector, and substantially increased its&#13;
agrarian activities. The legal framework supporting LBP has changed again in&#13;
1995.   Under the new Land Bank Act (RA 7907, approved Feb 23, 1995), LBP's&#13;
position has been substantially strengthened. Specifically, the new act (i)&#13;
provides for LBP's capital to be increased to P9 billion (US$ 330 million), (ii)&#13;
reconfirms governments intentions to underwrite and fund LBP's land reform&#13;
lending, including specifically earmarking funds from the Asset Privatization&#13;
Trust which are to be made available to LBP for this purpose, and (iii) removes&#13;
LBP from the constraints of operating within government salary scales.&#13;
2.13      Organizational Structure.   LBP's dual role as commercial bank and&#13;
financial institution responsible for financing of agrarian reform activities is&#13;
clearly reflected in its current organizational structure (see Appendix D (LBP's&#13;
organizational charts), Annex 2.11.  LBP's operations and staff are divided into&#13;
two broad streams: "agrarian" and "banking". Agrarian sector staff based in 12&#13;
regional and 126 field offices make loans to small farmers through cooperatives&#13;
or rural banks and deal with land valuation for land reform through the regional&#13;
land reform offices. Banking sector staff deal with corporate clients through&#13;
LBP's head office and its network of 161 branches. Within its banking sector,&#13;
LBP engages in two main types of activities: (i) commercial banking; and (ii)&#13;
investment banking mainly limited to investments in Government securities and&#13;
newly privatized companies. LBP is controlled by a Board of Directors, which&#13;
until recently has comprised seven members; four ex-officio positions - the&#13;
Secretary of Finance, who is the Chairman; the President of LBP, who is the Vice-&#13;
chairman; the Secretary of Agrarian Reform; and the Secretary of Labor, and three&#13;
appointees of the President of the Philippines, representing (i) agrarian reform&#13;
beneficiaries; (ii) the landowners; and (iii) the private sector. Under the new&#13;
act, the board is increased to nine. The ex-officio members have been increased&#13;
to five by the addition of the Secretary of Agriculture, the other four members&#13;
represent land reform beneficiaries (2) , and the private sector (2) . Details on&#13;
LBP's operation and performance are given in Annex 2.1.&#13;
2.14      Assets and Liabilities.  LBP has substantially expanded its available&#13;
resources over recent years to a total of P97.2 billion (US$3.6 billion) as of&#13;
December 31, 1994.   About 9% of these resources result from retained earnings,&#13;
bringing LBP's total equity to P10 billion. The main source of funds at 1994&#13;
year end was government deposits of P47 billion or 48% of total resources. On&#13;
the assets side, cash and investment in Government securities together also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
totalled P47 billion or 48% of its total assets, and net loans amounting to P37&#13;
billion, 38%.&#13;
2.15      Lending Operations.   LBP also substantially expanded its lending&#13;
portfolio during the last five years (1990 - 1994) at an annual nominal rate of&#13;
41%  (Table 2.2).   This has resulted in LBP's total gross loan portfolio&#13;
increasing by a factor of about four, from P9.7 billion to P38.4 billion (US$1.4&#13;
billion) . As of December 1993, loans outstanding to the agrarian sector (mainly&#13;
for short-term) accounted for about P11.5 billion or 30% of LBP's gross loan&#13;
portfolio; commercial lending (including agriculture) P18.2 billion or 47%, and&#13;
wholesale ALF and CLF term lending P3.3 billion or 9% of the loan portfolio.&#13;

2.16      Initially LBP extended agrarian loans to individual farmers, but over&#13;
the past five years it has increasingly changed its strategy and now channels&#13;
credit to these borrowers on a wholesale basis through two main channels -&#13;
agricultural cooperatives and rural banks. In 1994, rural banks accounted for&#13;
92.0 billion (339) of LBP resources disbursed for agrarian loans, while&#13;
cooperatives lent 67% or P4.0 billion. The number of cooperatives serviced by&#13;
LBP increased dramatically from just over 200 in 1988 to over 6,500 at the end&#13;
of 1993, but fell to 3,734 in 1994.&#13;
2.17      Most of these cooperatives have only been formed recently, are small&#13;
in terms of membership and asset size, and have very limited management and loan&#13;
administration capacity. This requires that LBP deploy a substantial amount of&#13;
field staff resources assisting cooperatives with sub-loan administration,&#13;
general cooperative management and project development.   Additionally,  the&#13;
limited experience and equity of many of the borrowing cooperatives tends to&#13;
impact negatively on their repayment capacity. To assure that the cooperatives,&#13;
served by LBP, will in due course develop into viable organizations and adequate&#13;
retailinq institutions for LBP loans, several issues must be addressed: (i) LBP&#13;
needs to make its accreditation criteria for cooperatives more stringent; (ii)&#13;
cooperatives need to be provided with technical assistance aimed at institutional&#13;
strengthening; and (iii) more emphasis needs to be placed on savings mobilization&#13;
preceding or at least in tandem with agrarian lending. LBP is aware of these&#13;
issues and has decided to consolidate and strengthen its current achievements in&#13;
agrarian lending rather than substantially expand it over the next few years -&#13;
this is reflected by both the reduction in numbers of cooperatives serviced and&#13;
in loan disbursement to cooperatives from P6.3 billion in 1992 to P5.3 billion&#13;
in 1993 and P4.0 in 1994. In addition, the proposed project through the&#13;
institutional strengthening component would address these issues (para. 3.9).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
2.18      Portfolio Quality.   Analysis of LBP's balance sheet  (Annex 2.1)&#13;
indicates that the proportion of net loans either past due or in litigation&#13;
improved from 7.0% in 1990 to 1.5% in December 1993 but declined to 5.2% in 1994.&#13;
However, the overall satisfactory situation concerning past due loans has&#13;
partially resulted from a rapid increase in restructured loans, particularly in&#13;
the agrarian sector (LBP usually restructures agrarian loans as a result of&#13;
natural calamity) .  Overall 10.3% of all net loans are either past due or&#13;
restructured - about the same as the 1990 figure, 9.8%, but a deterioration from&#13;
5.7% in 1991. In the banking sector, the situation has generally improved, and&#13;
by December 1994 only 2.8% of net loans were either restructured or past due.&#13;
However, there do appear to be problems with the agrarian portfolio. Although&#13;
net non-performing loans and restructured loans as a share of net loans (net of&#13;
mortgage loans) improved significantly between 1988 (42%) and 1990 (4.9%), the&#13;
figure has significantly deteriorated since then to 28.6% in-December 1993 and&#13;
37.3% in December 1994. This deterioration was caused by: (i) too rapid lending&#13;
expansion to newly established cooperatives; (ii) weak cooperative borrowers&#13;
(para.  2.17);  (iii)  inadequate  crop  insurance  arrangements;  and  (iv)  an&#13;
exceptionally high level of natural disasters which destroyed farmers' produce.&#13;
The issue of the quality of the agrarian loan portfolio would be treated under&#13;
the institutional action plan of the proposed project (para. 3.9).&#13;
2.19      Profitability, Liguidity and Solvency.   LBP's net income has risen&#13;
substantially over the last six  years reaching P1.2 billion in 1993.   Real&#13;
returns to equity have averaged 5% between 1990 and 1994. LBP's earnings have&#13;
come mainly from its commercial banking (60%) and investment operations (40%).&#13;
Until the end of 1992, the Agrarian Reform Fund (ARF) substantially covered LBP's&#13;
nominal net costs associated with agrarian lending. Therefore, agrarian lending&#13;
did not have a significant impact on LBP's profit and loss account through 1992.&#13;
As of January 1, 1993, however, ARF no longer covers LBP's operating costs&#13;
associated with lending to small farmers. This affects LBP's profitability to&#13;
the extent that interest rates do not fully cover these costs. Indeed the net&#13;
accounting loss on the agrarian sector borne by LBP in 1993, after allowing for&#13;
support of P461 million (US$16 million) from ARF was P974 million (US$36&#13;
million).  This loss did not take into account the necessary provisioning&#13;
adjustments or the opportunity cost of funds deployed.   The fact that LBP's&#13;
profit was not substantially reduced in 1993 as a result of ARF diminishing&#13;
support was largely due to strong performance in both its foreign exchange and&#13;
share  owning  operations.    Profits  of  P222  million  on  foreign  exchange&#13;
revaluation, and P636 million on assets sales - mainly privatization issue shares&#13;
- pretty well offset the net accounting loss on agrarian operations. In 1994,&#13;
support from ARF increased again to P1,171 million (US$43 million) and the net&#13;
loss on agrarian lending borne by LBP consequently fell to P777 million (US$29&#13;
million).&#13;
2.20      One means of evaluating LBP's operational performance and its self&#13;
sustainability is to review its Subsidy Dependence Index (SDI)' over the past&#13;
six years. The level of this index depends upon LBP's role - whether certain&#13;
l/    The definition of the SDI is the percentage by which the average annual&#13;
lending interest rate would need to be raisecl, over the interest rate&#13;
actually collected, in order to fully cover the cost of both explicit and&#13;
implicit subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
costs are considered as provision of services on behalf of the Government and,&#13;
therefore, LBP should be reimbursed for them, or whether they are truly part of&#13;
LBP's costs and therefore need to be covered by interest rate spreads or user&#13;
fees. The most pragmatic approach is to consider the situation under which LBP&#13;
is likely to be working in the future.1&#13;
2.21      The SDI worsened (Table 2.3) between 1988 and 1991 (from 4.1% to&#13;
30.81) as the volume of agrarian loans was increased, but improved in 1993 and&#13;
1994 as the size of the banking operations expanded relative to loans to small&#13;
farmers and interest rate on ARLs has become positive in real terms as inflation&#13;
went down. The SDI is now 6%, indicating that in 1994 LBP needed an effective&#13;
subsidy of roughly 6% of its gross interest earnings in order to break even. In&#13;
the past three years, the average effective subsidy LBP has had from 'free'&#13;
provision of equity, would have covered its 'Adjusted Net Loss'.  This indicates&#13;
that this subsidy together with the profit which LBP made on its banking sector&#13;
activities would have been sufficient to compensate for the net real costs of&#13;
agrarian lending.&#13;

2.22        LBP's liquid assets to deposit ratio has somewhat declined from a&#13;
high 1.4 in 1989 to 0.9 as of December 1993. This level remains satisfactory,&#13;
and well above the average for the top five Philippine private banks, which was&#13;
0.5 at the 1993 year end. Although LBP's equity as a share of total assets has&#13;
dropped from a peak of 31t in 1989 to 10.5% in December 1994 (mainly due to the&#13;
rapid expansion of deposits), LBP remains highly solvent and its risk assets to&#13;
equity ratio of about 4.4 compares favorably to that of the top five Philippine&#13;
private banks (5.2 in 1993).&#13;
1/    For these estimates, it is assumed that LBP would be responsible for loans&#13;
to  small  farmers  [Agrarian  Reform  Loans  (ARLs)],  through  their&#13;
cooperatives, but its operations in land purchase and Agrarian Reform&#13;
Mortgages (ARMs) would be as an agent of Government/ARF who would provide&#13;
the necessary funding and fully cover LBP's related operating costs. In&#13;
this instance, to be conservative, LBP's technical support for cooperative&#13;
development is considered an integral part of LBP's small farmer lending&#13;
operations, and therefore, its own responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
2.23      Outstanding Issues.   LBP will be facing four main issues over the&#13;
years to come: (i) its relationship with ARF; (ii) financial responsibility for&#13;
land reform; (iii) cost of agrarian lending; and (iv) resource mobilization.&#13;
These issues would be addressed in LBP's Institutional Strengthening Action Plan&#13;
(para. 3.9).&#13;
2.24      ARF.  The Agrarian Reform Fund (ARF) was established under CARP to&#13;
finance costs associated with agrarian reform. Between 1987 and 1990 about P2.85&#13;
million were transferred from ARF to LBP to cover operating costs in the agrarian&#13;
sector and to fund land reform mortgage loans and agrarian production loans. In&#13;
1991, however, ARF failed to cover the full costs associated with lending to the&#13;
agrarian sector plus financing of agrarian loans and land mortgages, leaving LBP&#13;
to fund P1.6 billion worth of agrarian loans with its own resources. Beginning&#13;
in January 1993, ARF intends only to cover operating costs associated with land&#13;
acquisition and transfers (in 1993 it did not fully cover these costs, leaving&#13;
part to be shouldered by LBP, but in 1994, resource flow from ARF to LBP was more&#13;
than adequate for this purpose) . Since essentially all agrarian loans extended&#13;
by LBP between 1987 and 1991 were covered by ARF, it should also be held&#13;
responsible for loan losses (85% as agreed upon by LBP's Board) associated with&#13;
these loans.  This not only requires that LBP provision adequately for these&#13;
loans, but that the share of ARF's provisioning be adequately reflected in its&#13;
outstanding balance with LBP. The issue of adequate provisioning for expected&#13;
loan losses would be addressed through the corporate action plan {para. 3.9(e)).&#13;
2.25      Land Reform. The current arrangements for land purchases under CARP&#13;
have serious potential implications for LBP, as there is a mismatch between&#13;
payments to landowners and receipts from small farmer mortgages which amounts to&#13;
about P22,900 (US$820) per hectare in present value terms, before accounting for&#13;
administrative costs.   The present procedure requires LBP to pay landowners&#13;
within 30 days, partly by cash (30%) and partly by LBP bonds (70%), funded&#13;
through ARF. To date this has not created a problem as ARF has fully funded&#13;
these costs. While adequate funds may continue to be available to cover the cash&#13;
payments (30%) associated with new land acquisition, ARF no longer has the&#13;
resources to ensure financial coverage of the ten years future liability&#13;
associated with the remaining 70% of any land purchase.   Should ARF fail to&#13;
mobilize new resources, LBP would be left with a substantial amount of bonds to&#13;
be serviced and retired, yet with only limited income from corresponding&#13;
mortgages.    These mortgages,  as well  as the land purchased but not yet&#13;
distributed are currently included in LBP's "risk assets", and potentially limit&#13;
the volume of LBP's other business, because of BSP's restrictions on "risk asset&#13;
ratios" for banks. In order to safeguard the remainder of LBP's business against&#13;
the possibility of not being reimbursed for its cost of servicing bonds,&#13;
arrangements whereby CARP related mortgage financing operations be legally&#13;
protected from the rest of LBP have been finalized (see para 3.9) . In parallel,&#13;
the corresponding assets (land for distribution and mortgages) need to be&#13;
excluded from LBP's risk assets. Under the agreed arrangements LBP would act&#13;
solely as a collecting agent, manager and bookkeeper for CARP,  while the&#13;
financial obligations would be assumed by GOP.&#13;
2.26      Costs of Agrarian Lending.   LBP's operating costs associated with&#13;
agrarian lending have dropped markedly, from 34% of net outstanding loans in&#13;
1988, when it focussed mainly on retailing, to 7.2% in 1994, when it engaged&#13;
exclusively in wholesaling. Together with an estimated annual loan loss of about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
8%, however, the total costs amount to some 15%- of average net loans outstanding,&#13;
which LBP's current interest rate spread of between 4% and 10% fails to fully&#13;
cover.  This issue should be addressed by: (i) further raising interest rates&#13;
charged to small farmers as much as politically feasible; (ii) reducing unit&#13;
operating costs; and (iii) identifying sources to cover costs associated with the&#13;
provision of technical assistance to cooperatives, as it is estimated that up to&#13;
25% of agrarian operating costs are incurred by the latter.   These can be&#13;
regarded as development expenditures which interest rates charged to farmers&#13;
should not necessarily cover as long as adequate alternative resources can be&#13;
secured for this purpose. Cost reduction of agrarian lending operation would be&#13;
part of institutional strengthening program {para. 3.9(d)).&#13;
2.27      Resource Mobilization.   Currently,  LBP is dependent on government&#13;
agencies (public) deposits. Of total deposits held by LBP (P51.5 billion, as of&#13;
December 31, 1993) public sector deposits were 90% (P46.6 billion) . Furthermore,&#13;
besides its equity, LBP's own resources consist mainly of short term deposits,&#13;
while it depends almost exclusively on external resources for term lending. To&#13;
reduce dependence on public deposits and foreign financing in the long run, LBP&#13;
is considering the development of new instruments, such as loan sales and medium&#13;
term bonds, as well as setting annual targets for the increase of private sector&#13;
deposits and savings.   Resource mobilization efforts would be part of the&#13;
institutional strengthening action plan under the proposed project (para. 3.9(c)).&#13;
Bank Sector Assistance Strategy and Experience&#13;
2.28      The Bank has actively supported agricultural  development  in the&#13;
Philippines, as a means to stimulate both economic growth and rural poverty&#13;
reduction. Since 1964, the Bank has approved some 45 loans and credits (about&#13;
US$1.8  billion)   for  investment  in  agriculture  and  rural  development.&#13;
Approximately one-third of these were for irrigation development, and another&#13;
one-third for rural credit.   The remainder have been for area-based rural&#13;
development projects, rural infrastructure, processing and storage, land&#13;
settlement, extension and research, smallholder forestry, watershed management&#13;
and erosion control, agricultural inputs (under one policy-based loan) and small&#13;
coconut farm development. Implementation of completed and ongoing Bank-financed&#13;
projects has generally been satisfactory, although some operations have&#13;
experienced delays because of local funding constraints, overly optimistic&#13;
targets, design changes during project implementation, peace and order problems,&#13;
weak or poorly coordinated multiple implementing agencies, and time-consuming&#13;
procurement procedures.&#13;
2.29      Previous agricultural credit projects  (including loans for crops,&#13;
livestock, fisheries, and agro-processing) have been mainly for medium- and long-&#13;
term credit. Investments financed have been generally productive, and completed&#13;
projects have shown satisfactory results. Of the 16 previous credit operations,&#13;
the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) received eight loans totaling&#13;
US$130.4  million.   Although these projects  emphasized DBP's  institutional&#13;
development and financial viability, DBP experienced high loan arrears on its&#13;
overall portfolio (most of them on loans not financed by Bank projects) which&#13;
contributed to its financial difficulties in mid-1980s, and in turn had an&#13;
adverse impact on agricultural credit operations in general. Some US$23 million&#13;
uncommitted under the Third Livestock and Fisheries Project (Loan 1849-PH) and&#13;
the Smallholder Tree Farming Project (Loan 1506-PH), both implemented by DBP,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
were cancelled due to DBP's financial problems. Some of the past credit projects&#13;
(Loans 432-PH, 607-PH, 1010-PH, and 1399-PH) provided some US$76 million to the&#13;
Central Bank for onlending through the rural banking system to finance farm&#13;
mechanization, irrigation equipment and rural enterprises.   Performance under&#13;
these projects in terms of increased production and rural employment was&#13;
satisfactory, but the projects were only moderately successful in promoting&#13;
institutional development mainly due to financial problems of rural banks,&#13;
arising particularly from sub-loan arrears under government-sponsored credit&#13;
program  (principally M-99,  para.2.4) .   Another project,  the Small  Farmer&#13;
Development Project (Loan 1646-PH) implemented by LBP (December 1978 to June&#13;
1985), had experienced institutional problems including weak field office&#13;
organization and sub-loan arrears.&#13;
2.30      Recent Financial IntermediarV Loans.   The Bank's strategy to help&#13;
develop the Philippine financial sector has the following main objectives: (i)&#13;
to phase out subsidies through interest rates or other lending variables; (ii)&#13;
to support the privatization of the public commercial bank - the Philippine&#13;
National Bank (PNB) - and to strengthen the second tier operations of DBP and LBP&#13;
while ensuring that they maintain an adequate creditworthiness upon solid&#13;
financial conditions consistent with international prudential criteria; (iii) to&#13;
support Government's policies, based upon market mechanisms, to price lending&#13;
interest rates and fees of complementary services such as crop insurance and&#13;
small- and medium-lending guarantee schemes; and (iv) to encourage private&#13;
financial intermediaries to lend directly to small and medium sized borrowers,&#13;
including those in the countryside, charging market fees to fully cover operating&#13;
costs and the risks involved. Also, financial intermediaries, including those&#13;
in the rural areas, would be induced to enhance their domestic resource&#13;
mobilization.&#13;
2.31      Under  the  first  Rural  Finance  Project  (Loan  3356-PH)  and  the&#13;
Industrial Restructuring Project (Loan 3287-PH) the above strategy was&#13;
successfully initiated. During implementation of the two projects substantial&#13;
progress was achieved in meeting the stated objectives. First, lending rates to&#13;
financial intermediaries have been set at levels that are deemed competitive with&#13;
those of domestically mobilized resources. Given the substantial reduction in&#13;
interest rates during the implementation life of the two projects, a recent&#13;
modification of onlending rates has been put into effect so as to redefine the&#13;
formulae and select the most reliable indicator as the proxy for market rates.&#13;
The rate of Treasury bills, the most traded paper in the market, has been&#13;
selected as the proxy, which seems more than adequate for the proposed loan.&#13;
Second, PNB has already started its privatization process in a successful way.&#13;
DBP and LBP have strengthened their second-tier lending operations and have&#13;
maintained an adequate solid condition. Under the proposed operation, LBP would&#13;
be required to: (i) establish adequate solutions with the Government on how to&#13;
further strengthen its institutional and financial condition, particularly with&#13;
regard to its agrarian reform activities; (ii) increase its efficiency with&#13;
special emphasis on its agrarian lending, by increasing its spread and reducing&#13;
unit operating costs through operational streamlining and efforts to support&#13;
grouping and a more efficient organization of eligible cooperatives; and (iii)&#13;
enhance its procedures for the accreditation of eligible cooperatives (paras. 3.9&#13;
and 4.21) . Third, adequate accreditation procedures of financial intermediaries&#13;
have been established under the first two projects.  With regard to LBP, the&#13;
accreditation criteria have proven to be satisfactory and in line with interna-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
tionally accepted prudential standards. Fourth, under the first Rural Finance&#13;
Project (Loan 3356-PH) a component was included to strengthen the private rural&#13;
banks1. The component aimed at enhancing their financial condition as well as&#13;
their prospects of mobilizing domestic resources in the rural areas.   The&#13;
component was successful by helping to increase the paid-in capital of rural&#13;
banks by P1583.9 million. As a result, there are currently over 250 rural banks&#13;
with a sound financial condition (out of a total of 787 rural banks) .  These&#13;
sound rural banks are now an important factor to provide financial services in&#13;
the countryside.&#13;
2.32      From the standpoint of the proposed project,  the most  important&#13;
earlier Bank credit operations were the Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 2570-PH&#13;
of US$100 million) and the first Rural Finance Project (Loan 3356-PH of US$150&#13;
million).  Under these projects,  the Agricultural Loan Fund  (ALF) and the&#13;
Countryside Loan Fund (CLF) were established in 1985 and 1991, respectively. ALF&#13;
and CLF (the FUNDS) are wholesale lines of credit available to banks for&#13;
onlending to agricultural and rural investments.   Both of the FUNDS are the&#13;
responsibility of LBP. The FUNDS are now fully committed and the present rate&#13;
of disbursements is controlled by the rate of repayment of outstanding loans and&#13;
provision for fund amortization.&#13;
2.33      ALF and CLF performance  in terms of their financial positions,&#13;
disbursement and loan collection, the number of PFIs, the range of sub-borrowers&#13;
and sub-sector coverage, is satisfactory, but the FUNDS are short of free lending&#13;
resources to meet the country's growing demand for rural investment financing.&#13;
The proposed project has been prepared for the purpose of continuing and&#13;
strengthening the FUNDS operation with particular emphasis on providing&#13;
additional resources for term credit and strengthening LBP as a wholesale&#13;
financial institution serving the rural areas. An analysis of loans made and&#13;
sub-projects supported under the CLF is provided in Annex 2.2.&#13;
Lessons Learned&#13;
2.34      The broad  lessons  that  emerge  from the  review of the previous&#13;
agricultural and rural credit projects are: (i) directed credit by crop or type&#13;
of investments, at subsidized interest rates, did not sustain economic growth,&#13;
improve credit delivery system in the rural areas, or increase access of rural&#13;
borrowers to formal credit facilities; (ii) heavy arrears and poor financial&#13;
conditions of the apex institutions and/or the selected PFIs severely constrained&#13;
projects'  sustainability;  (iii)  private  financial  resource mobilization is&#13;
extremely important for institutional sustainability; and (iv) strong financial&#13;
institutions along with qualified and experienced management and staff, at&#13;
headquarter, branches and field offices, are crucial to projects' success.&#13;
Whenever interest rates either fell significantly below or moved well above&#13;
prevailing market rates, serious implementation problems emerged: above-market&#13;
rates resulted in slow disbursement, while below-market rates led to&#13;
concentration of credit to relatively wealthier and large clients. These lessons&#13;
have been incorporated in the design of the proposed project, by applying a&#13;
1/    The program was launched on August 30, 1991 and managed by the Philippines&#13;
Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
market determined interest rate policy (paras. 4.7 to 4.9), and through policy&#13;
actions to be taken under the institutional strengthening program (para. 3.9).&#13;
Rationale for Bank Lending&#13;
2.35      The proposed project  is consistent  with  the Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS) which was presented to the Board on February 3, 1994.   Bank&#13;
assistance strategy in the Philippines focuses on supporting the maintenance of&#13;
an adequate macroeconomic framework; improving and expanding infrastructure;&#13;
strengthening the private business climate; and enhancing poverty alleviation,&#13;
sustainable development and improved governance.   The proposed project would&#13;
contribute to these objectives. In particular, it will assist private sector&#13;
investments which are now constrained by inadequate availability of medium and&#13;
long term loan funds, and it will also help poverty reduction through expanding&#13;
investments opportunities in the rural areas where most of the poor live. The&#13;
project will further advance the process already started under the first Rural&#13;
Finance Project (Loan 3356-PH), in (i) strengthening LBP as the major wholesale&#13;
financial  institution  serving  the  rural  areas;  (ii)  strengthening  rural&#13;
cooperatives through technical assistance and training to upgrade their operation&#13;
to become viable financial intermediaries serving their members; (iii)&#13;
strengthening the rural banking system through the provision and mobilization of&#13;
term lending resources and technical assistance; and (iv) encouraging more&#13;
private banks to operate and provide financial services in the rural areas,&#13;
particularly to finance medium and long term investments.   Therefore,  the&#13;
proposed project should be seen as a temporary intervention, providing needed&#13;
financial resources, support institutional strengthening activities, and allowing&#13;
more time for the rural financial sector to address its limitations.   Bank&#13;
involvement in the project is justified in view of the need to provide resources&#13;
to private economic rural activities and thus contribute to rural growth,&#13;
employment and poverty alleviation.   This would be achieved by improving&#13;
financial intermediation channels to the rural economy and by providing credit&#13;
resources for private rural investments. This project and the institutional and&#13;
policy reforms it supports are expected to play a major role in fostering rural&#13;
development.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Obiectives and Description&#13;
3.1       Building on the achievements of the first Rural Finance Project (Loan&#13;
3356-PH), the proposed project would help to expand the volume of medium and long&#13;
term commercial credit to agriculture and rural development in the Philippines&#13;
and to enhance the policy framework of the rural financial sector by: (a)&#13;
supporting the development of LBP's two funds: the Countryside Loan Fund (CLF)&#13;
and the Retail Cofinancing Fund (RCF) to finance private sector investments in&#13;
the  rural  areas;  (b)  strengthening  LBP  as  the main wholesale  financial&#13;
institution serving the rural areas; and (c) upgrading the operational capacity&#13;
of rural cooperatives, Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs), particularly&#13;
Thrift Banks (TBs) and Rural Banks (RBs), to provide financial services in the&#13;
rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
3.2       The project would be implemented over five years, and would comprise&#13;
the following components:&#13;
(a) Credit: medium and long term loans to finance private investments&#13;
in agricultural and other viable rural operations,  (both fixed&#13;
assets and incremental working capital) for a broad spectrum of&#13;
agricultural and non-farm rural investment,  (e.g. production,&#13;
processing,  marketing,  transport services,  storage facilities,&#13;
custom service or leasing operations,  and import of critical&#13;
inputs).   The credit operation would be determined by market&#13;
forces, with no earmarked allocations by crop or type of&#13;
investment and would bear a market determined interest rate. This&#13;
component would include two programs.&#13;
(i)   CLF II: a wholesale operation to be carried out by LBP. CLF&#13;
II resources would be channelled through accredited&#13;
financial institutions for onlending to private investors;&#13;
(ii) RCF: a cofinancing lending program for medium and long term&#13;
rural investments, implemented by LBP to finance, together&#13;
with other financial institutions, eligible sub-projects&#13;
initiated by LBP's own customers;&#13;
(b) Institutional   Strengthening   Program.        Strengthening   LBP&#13;
financially and organizationally to ensure its sustainability in&#13;
providing  financial  services  to the rural population.   This&#13;
component would support LBP's long-term development program with&#13;
concentration on private saving mobilization, agrarian lending&#13;
policy,  and organizational streamlining.   The component would&#13;
consist of implementation of an Institutional Strengthening Action&#13;
Plan   (ISAP)   aimed  at  strengthening  LBP's  financial  and&#13;
institutional capabilities as wholesale financial institution&#13;
serving the rural areas. An important element of this would be&#13;
training and technical assistance with special attention on the&#13;
management and members/staff of the cooperative, TBs, and RBs.&#13;
B. Detailed Features&#13;
The Credit Component&#13;
3.3       The credit component,  under the project,  would provide sub-loans&#13;
totalling US$220 million which would finance private rural investments of at&#13;
least US$260 million. Two programs would be offered: (a) a wholesale operation&#13;
to be carried out through the second phase of the Countryside Loan Fund (CLF II)&#13;
with total investment of about US$120 million; and (b) LBP's medium- and long-&#13;
term lending facility to be implemented through the Retail Cofinancing Fund (RCF)&#13;
with total sub-projects cost of about US$140 million. Each of the two sub-&#13;
components would provide two types of loans: a Peso or US Dollar sub-loans to&#13;
accommodate the sub-borrowers' needs. The foreign exchange risk would be borne&#13;
by the government for small and medium sized sub-borrowers (up to total assets&#13;
of Peso 250 million) and by the sub-borrowers in all other cases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
3.4       CLF II.   The project would provide US$90 million equivalent of&#13;
additional funds for the existing CLF lending facility. LBP, which is already&#13;
managing the ongoing CLF, would be the apex institution for channelling the CLF&#13;
sub-component through the Participating Financial Institutions  (PFIs),  for&#13;
eligible incremental investments in agricultural and non-farm rural economic&#13;
activities (paras. 4.5 to 4.6). LBP would perform this wholesale function on a&#13;
commercial basis, and would exclude itself from direct lending to sub-borrowers&#13;
under CLF.  Assurances to these effects were obtained at negotiations {para.&#13;
6.1 (a)}.&#13;
3.5       RCF.  The Retail Cofinancing Fund (RCF) of about US$120 million would&#13;
finance medium and long term rural investments to be carried out by LBP's retail&#13;
customers. The RCF would be funded partially by the Bank (US$60 million) and&#13;
jointly with at least US$60 million by LBP and any financial institutions; the&#13;
latter's participation would be at least 75% of the cofinancing package (LBP and&#13;
private financial institution) or about 32% of the sub-project cost.  The RCF&#13;
would enable LBP to finance directly together with any financial institution&#13;
viable medium- and long-term rural investments of its own clients, on terms&#13;
competitive with those of the PFIs and in accordance with the Policy Manual to&#13;
be agreed upon with the Bank.   The main reasons for having this cofinancing&#13;
component are: (i) it would allow LBP to develop further its activities in&#13;
cofinancing and syndication operations which is an important feature in the&#13;
development of its wholesale operation; (ii) LBP, as the administrator of the CLF&#13;
has not been able to offer CLF medium- and long-term loans to its own customers&#13;
on a retail basis, placing it at a disadvantage vis-a-vis CLF-accredited banks;&#13;
and (iii) existing rural commercial clients of LBP, especially those that have&#13;
pledged their collateral to LBP, have been deprived from using CLF loans. The&#13;
cofinancing lending program not only meets LBP's need for additional term&#13;
resources, but would also enable LBP to improve earning opportunities on the&#13;
counterpart requirements funded with internally generated resources, contributing&#13;
to its financial viability.&#13;
3.6       Single Currency and Peso Sub-Loans.  Under the project, sub-borrowers&#13;
would be able to select sub-loans denominated in US dollars or Pesos under the&#13;
new SCL expanded program offered by the Bank. A survey of potential and existing&#13;
sub-borrowers under the first CLF operation has shown that a number of them are&#13;
well situated to bear the foreign exchange risks of a single currency loan&#13;
because they generate foreign exchange revenue through direct and indirect export&#13;
of their products. The survey further indicated that the US dollar would be the&#13;
most appropriate currency for serving the needs of potential sub-borrowers. LBP&#13;
has selected the two main borrowing options under the SCL program: the SCL at&#13;
fixed rate  (FRSCL) and the SCL at Libor-based floating rate (VRSCL) .   This&#13;
selection would allow LBP to offer a wider variety of loan term choices,&#13;
including both currency and interest rate basis, to match the needs of sub-&#13;
borrowers while minimizing the attendant risk. This should enable LBP to reduce&#13;
the overall cost of intermediating such risk.&#13;
3.7       The demand for medium and long term funds is currently running at a&#13;
level substantially above their availability.   Future needs for term lending&#13;
resources, and hence the rate of drawdown of the loan, would be dependent on the&#13;
overall performance of the economy, interest rate relative to other rediscounting&#13;
sources, and the level of investment and reinvestment in the rural sector. It&#13;
is estimated that the total investment requirement to maintain existing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
agricultural facilities and provide for planned sectoral economic growth of about&#13;
4% per annum over five years (as proposed in the Philippine Agricultural Medium-&#13;
Term Development Plan 1993 - 1998) would be about US$20 billion in 1994 prices&#13;
(para. 1.9) . On this basis, LBP's available medium and long term resources would&#13;
provide about 2% of total agricultural investment.  Under a more modest scenario&#13;
of lower 1% annual growth, investment needs would be reduced to about P150&#13;
billion over five years, mostly for reinvestment. In this case the combined CLF&#13;
funds would provide about 8% of total agricultural investment. As CLF combined&#13;
resources would be used not only for agriculture, but also for other rural&#13;
endeavors, the percentage of total rural investment which CLF would cover,&#13;
assuming full disbursement in five years, would likely be below 5%. This should&#13;
be readily attainable, provided the fund is well administered and its cost is in&#13;
line with wholesale market interest rates.&#13;
3.8       The records of CLF I and II and RCF (the FUNDS) operations would be&#13;
kept separately within LBP's accounts. Detailed estimates of the FUNDS cash-flow&#13;
are given in Annex 3.1. As LBP would operate the FUNDS on a commercial basis,&#13;
it should make profits. Such net profits would be reflected in LBP's Profit and&#13;
Loss Account, and would remain within the FUNDs as LBP's contribution. Agreement&#13;
to this effect was reached at negotiations {para. 6.1 (b)}.&#13;
Institutional and Policy Reform Component&#13;
3.9       To guarantee LBP's continued strong performance in the rural areas and&#13;
to allow for sustainable expansion, LBP has prepared an Institutional&#13;
Strengthening Action Plan (ISAP) agreed with the Bank and which would be&#13;
implemented as part of the proposed project. The approval of the agreed ISAP by&#13;
LBP's Board would be a condition of loan effectiveness {para 6.2 (i)}.  The ISAP&#13;
would include specific measures to address the following institutional issues:&#13;
(a) Safeguarding LBP's Financial Strength.   Arrangements have been&#13;
made or would be made between LBP and Government to safeguard LBP&#13;
in three main areas:&#13;
(i)   Land Reform Bonds.   The issuance of National Government&#13;
Bonds to compensate landowners for newly purchased land&#13;
under CARP has been approved for implementation under an&#13;
Executive Order 267 dated July 25, 1995;&#13;
(ii)   Land Reform Risk Assets.  As a corollary to the changed&#13;
status of land reform bonds, arrangements would be made&#13;
with GOP/LBP to exclude land acquired for redistribution&#13;
and land reform mortgages from LBP's risk assets; and&#13;
(iii) Dividend Policy. Arrangements would be made with GOP/LBP&#13;
that dividends would only be paid by LBP from its real&#13;
profit after (1) allowing adequate provisioning for loan&#13;
losses,  (2)  adjusting  for  the  impact  of  within  year&#13;
inflation, and (3) when profits allowed, retaining earnings&#13;
at a level equal to at least one seventh of the growth in&#13;
LBP's net agrarian loan portfolio.&#13;
During negotiations agreement was reached that (ii) above would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
take effect before December 31, 1995 and (iii) would be carried&#13;
out annually {para 6.1 (c) and (d)).&#13;
(b) Lending Objectives.   LBP would define a detailed and realistic&#13;
lending program for the next five years, based on sectoral needs,&#13;
resource availability--both for lending and covering support&#13;
service costs--and still maintaining profitability in real terms.&#13;
(c) Resource Mobilization. While LBP's resources consist chiefly of&#13;
public short-term deposits, it depends mainly on external&#13;
resources for term-lending. To reduce dependence in the medium/&#13;
long run, on public sector deposits and on foreign financing, LBP&#13;
would aim at increasing private savings, including short-term&#13;
rural deposits.   Issuing medium- or long-term Peso bonds or&#13;
similar debt instruments would be phased in. Such an operation&#13;
would be initiated on a pilot basis.&#13;
(d) Costs of agrarian lending and related lending interest rates.&#13;
Currently LBP's spread does not fully cover agrarian lending&#13;
costs.   LBP has successfully mobilized substantial government&#13;
agencies' deposits which have yielded a high net income for LBP,&#13;
which may be sufficient to cover the agrarian lending costs&#13;
(including adequate provisions for probable losses) . However, to&#13;
sustain its operations over the long term, LBP would not only rely&#13;
on this source of additional income, but would also strive to&#13;
increase its lending spread and reduce unit operating costs.&#13;
These reductions can be obtained through organizational&#13;
streamlining and introduction of mechanisms (such as grouping or&#13;
merging cooperatives). Furthermore, LBP would monitor its costs&#13;
associated with the provision of "non-banking" services (i.e.&#13;
technical assistance and training to cooperatives), as well as&#13;
those associated with CARP related activities, with the aim of&#13;
securing adequate funding for them.&#13;
(e) Provisioning for loan losses. Three areas would be revised: (i)&#13;
LBP's loan classification system for agrarian loans (including&#13;
restructuring) ; (ii) corresponding provisioning ratios; and (iii)&#13;
timeliness of provisioning.&#13;
(f) Strengthening LBP's cooperative intermediaries.   An important&#13;
element in improving LBP's loan quality will be the strengthening&#13;
of its cooperative borrowers. A program to achieve this will be&#13;
carried out by LBP as follows:&#13;
Ci)   Improved cooperative accreditation criteria:   LBP would&#13;
review its cooperative accreditation criteria, so as to&#13;
assure adequate repayments and a gradual reduction of&#13;
technical assistance needs.   As stricter accreditation&#13;
criteria would disqualify a significant number of&#13;
cooperatives, application of the new criteria would be pha-&#13;
sed in gradually. This process would be accompanied by a&#13;
technical assistance program to help cooperatives achieve&#13;
the above mentioned criteria within a predetermined time&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
period. In the meantime, LBP would limit its exposure to&#13;
cooperatives that fail to meet the new criteria and have&#13;
questionable performance records;&#13;
(ii)   Enhanced cooperatives and agrarian database:  Statistics of&#13;
agrarian loans need to include information on the amounts&#13;
collected and rescheduled.   For this purpose LBP will&#13;
develop a cooperatives' and agrarian collections data base&#13;
and monitoring system;&#13;
(iii)  Enhanced savings and cross guarantees among cooDerative&#13;
members. LBP will design a pilot program to include some&#13;
100 selected cooperatives to start savings and cross&#13;
guarantee programs.&#13;
(g) LBP's Staff Training and Technical Assistance Program. Continued&#13;
training of LBP staff is an important element in the enhancement&#13;
of LBP's ability to deal with the growing challenges related to&#13;
its operations. To enhance and upgrade its training system, LBP&#13;
will carry out a Technical Assistance (TA) program aiming at&#13;
strengthening the following aspects associated with rural credit:&#13;
(i)    LBP's agrarian sector operations, by: (1) fortifying LBP's&#13;
Field Offices and their operations; and (2) enhancing the&#13;
cooperatives' financial intermediation capacity.&#13;
(ii)   CLF related staff in LBP and the PFIs would be trained in&#13;
the following areas: (1) upgrading the knowledge and skills&#13;
of LBP's CLF unit's staff for reviewing and appraising sub-&#13;
project feasibility studies and supervising the PFIs and&#13;
their    sub-projects;    (2)    developing    the    PFI&#13;
skills--especially   RFIs--in   the   preparation   and&#13;
presentation of sub-project financing requests; and (3)&#13;
enhancing the ability of LBP's CLF unit and PFIs staff to&#13;
review and monitor environmental aspects of sub-projects&#13;
and strengthening the enforcement process of the&#13;
environmental clearance system; and&#13;
(iii)  LEP's  accounting  and  management  information  system,&#13;
focusing on: (1) the development of an improved cost&#13;
allocation methodology and procedures, mainly between&#13;
agrarian and commercial banking operations; (2) the&#13;
development of integral accounting and reporting require-&#13;
ments of the CLF and other foreign funded lending programs;&#13;
and (3) the development of an adequate data base on LBP's&#13;
cooperative system.&#13;
3.10      Estimated Project Costs and Financing.   Total project costs are&#13;
estimated at US$262.7 million, of which US$91.9 million  (35%) would be the&#13;
foreign exchange component and about US$15 million would be taxes and duties.&#13;
The foreign exchange cost component was estimated based on the assumption&#13;
underlying the indicative lending program and would vary depending on the&#13;
eventual composition of the lending program in response to market forces. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
proposed Bank loans of US$150 million would finance up to 57.1% of total project&#13;
costs--about 99% (US$91 million equivalent) of the foreign exchange costs and&#13;
about 35% (US$59 million equivalent) of the local currency costs. Local cost&#13;
financing is justified because of the Philippines' current economic situation and&#13;
the poverty alleviation objectives of the project. The remaining project costs&#13;
would be financed as follows: (i) sub-loan beneficiaries, at least 14.9% (US$39.2&#13;
million equivalent); (ii) participating banks at least 21.7% (US$57 million&#13;
equivalent; and (iii) and LBP, at least 6.3t (US$16.5 million, including US$1.5&#13;
million contribution to the TA and Training program). The Bank loans for an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$150 million would be made available to LBP with the&#13;
guarantee of the Government of the Philippines. The three loans of US$50 million&#13;
each include a currency pool loan (CPL/Loan A), a US dollar Libor-based single&#13;
currency loan (VRSCL/Loan B), and a US dollar fixed rate single currency loan&#13;
(FRSCL/Loan C). The CPL and the VRSCL would have a term of 20 years with 5 years&#13;
of grace and would carry the Bank's standard variable interest rate for the&#13;
targeted currency pool loans and for a US$ Libor-based single currency loans,&#13;
respectively. The FRSCL would be payable in 15 years with 3 years of grace and&#13;
would carry the Bank's standard US dollar fixed rate for 12 years maturity.&#13;

3.11      Procurement of goods and work financed with loans funds would be on&#13;
the basis of procedures which are customary for a development finance operation.&#13;
They would apply both to situations where CLF/RCF funds are disbursed directly&#13;
against any sub-project and also when disbursement is used to repay an interim&#13;
loan for an eligible sub-project. Contracts above US$5 million equivalent will&#13;
normally be procured by International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance&#13;
with Bank procurement guidelines, including the use of Bank's standard bidding&#13;
documents. In evaluating ICB tenders, a margin of 15% of the c.i.f. bid price or&#13;
actual custom duties, whichever is less, would be allowed for preference for&#13;
domestic manufacturers. All ICB packages will be subject to Bank prior approval.&#13;
Other procurement would follow established commercial practices which are&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank.   Limited International Bidding  (LIB)  and direct&#13;
contracting would be allowed for contracts costing more than US$5 million&#13;
equivalent in the following cases: (a) in the case of modernization or expansion&#13;
projects, for standardized equipment or proprietary parts needed for&#13;
compatibility with existing equipment; (b) for machinery which is available from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
only limited number of suppliers worldwide; and (c) where procedures are&#13;
otherwise justified for technical reasons. These cases would be subject to Bank&#13;
prior approval.   LBP would review the compliance of participating banks with&#13;
procurement procedures during its periodic supervision of project assisted sub-&#13;
loans.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
3.12      The proposed Bank loans of US$150 million would be disbursed over a&#13;
period of five years, during Bank FY96-2001 (for the CPL and VRSCL; the FRSCL is&#13;
scheduled to be fully disbursed by December 1998. The disbursement estimates are&#13;
based on experience under the last two projects of this type, the Agricultural&#13;
Credit and the Rural Finance Projects Loans 2570-PH and 3356-PH, respectively.&#13;
The disbursement schedule is given in Annex 3.2. The project would be completed&#13;
by September 30, 2001 and the expected Loan Closing Date for the CPL and VRSCL&#13;
would be June 30, 2002, the closing date for the FRSCL would be December 15,&#13;
1998. Disbursement of the loan proceeds would finance medium and long-term rural&#13;
investments in fixed assets, excluding land, and incremental working capital&#13;
including expansion of existing rural enterprises. The Bank would finance 100%&#13;
of PFIs and LBP's eligible sub-loans or 75% and 42.5% of sub-projects' costs in&#13;
the case of CLF II and RCF, respectively.  Disbursements for all expenditures&#13;
would be based on full documentation except for sub-loans below the free limit&#13;
of US$3 million for which disbursements may be made under statement of&#13;
expenditures (SOEs) . Supporting documents for disbursements based on SOEs would&#13;
be retained by LBP for review by external auditors and Bank supervision missions.&#13;
Retroactive financing of up to US$15 million equivalent is also proposed for&#13;
eligible credit sub-loans made by CLF after January 1, 1995. These sub-loans&#13;
were made under the pressure of the heavy demand for CLF resources which lead LBP&#13;
and PFIs, in anticipation of additional financing, to use short-term and/or&#13;
unrelated resources to support eligible rural sub-projects.&#13;

3.13      LBP would establish three Special Accounts  (one for Currency Pool&#13;
Loan-Loan A, one for the VRSCL-Loan B, and one for the FRSCL-Loan C) in&#13;
accordance with Bank guidelines to facilitate rapid disbursement of the Bank&#13;
loan. For each loan, the borrower will open and maintain in US Dollars a Special&#13;
account in a commercial bank specifically authorized for this purpose by the&#13;
Bangko Sentral ng pilipinas (BSP) and approved by the Bank. Initial deposits of&#13;
US$5 million for each of the Special Accounts would be made by the Bank into the&#13;
Special  Accounts,  representing  about  37.5t  of  the  expected  first  year&#13;
disbursements.   However, the authorized allocation for each Special Account,&#13;
shall be limited to an amount equivalent to US$3.5 million until disbursements&#13;
and outstanding commitments against the respective loan shall be equal to or&#13;
exceed the equivalent of US$10 million.  Applications for replenishment of the&#13;
Accounts, supported by appropriate documentation, would be submitted regularly&#13;
(preferably monthly, but not less than quarterly) or when the amounts withdrawn&#13;
equal 50t of the initial deposit.&#13;
Monitoring, Reporting and Audits&#13;
3.14      A project supervision plan is presented in Annex 3.3.   LBP would&#13;
submit to the Bank, on the basis of agreed format, periodic progress reports on&#13;
project implementation (quarterly progress report on the Credit component and&#13;
semi annual progress report on the Institutional Strengthening component) . These&#13;
reports would include an assessment of carrying out the credit, and the&#13;
institutional strengthening, including the technical assistance and training&#13;
components. LBP and the PFIs would maintain separate accounts for project funds.&#13;
The accounts of LBP, CLF, and RCF, the project Special Accounts and the Statement&#13;
of Expenditures (SOEs) related to project activities, would be audited annually&#13;
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit reports, including an&#13;
opinion regarding the supporting documentation for disbursements based on SOEs,&#13;
would be submitted to the Bank within six months after the end of LBP's fiscal&#13;
year.   Also, LBP would be responsible for the preparation of the Borrowers'&#13;
inputs to the project Implementation Completion Report. Agreement to this effect&#13;
was obtained during negotiations {para. 6.1 (e)}.  LBP would also require PFIs,&#13;
as necessary, to provide auditors' opinion on whether sub-loans, under the&#13;
project, are in agreement with the terms and conditions of project lending. In&#13;
addition LBP would selectively review project sub-loans and would provide a brief&#13;
report on the quality of sub-loans and the adequacy of PFIs' supervision and&#13;
record.&#13;
3.15      LBP would maintain a monitoring and evaluation system for the project&#13;
components. The objectives would be to identify constraints, initiate corrective&#13;
measures and upgrade project performance. The main elements of the monitoring&#13;
and evaluation system would comprise: (a) regular reporting on the financial and&#13;
physical progress within both LBP and the PFIs; and (b) annual evaluation during&#13;
project implementation to assess performance of (i) the institutional&#13;
strengthening and the training programs, (ii) typical sub-projects, and (iii) the&#13;
project financial impact on PFIs.&#13;
&#13;

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. General&#13;
4.1       As  the  Borrower  of  the  Bank  loans,  LBP  would  assume  overall&#13;
responsibility for project implementation. LBP is a universal bank, owned by the&#13;
Government, with considerable experience and exposure in the rural sector. LBP&#13;
is virtually the only financial institution in the Philippines which provides&#13;
agricultural and rural credit through rural financial institutions and&#13;
cooperatives to small farmers, fishermen, and non-farm investments. Since July&#13;
1990, it has managed successfully two Bank-financed credit funds: the&#13;
Agricultural Loan Fund (Loan 2570-PH) and the first Countryside Loan Fund, CLF I,&#13;
(Loan 3356-PH) . LBP is currently refining the monitoring tools which will be put&#13;
in place for the new project.  Also, LBP is continuing to upgrade, through a&#13;
regular and continuous training program, its own staff, those of the PFIs, and&#13;
cooperatives.  Overall, LBP is a strong bank, with 161 branches and 126 field&#13;
offices scattered throughout the country, with sound systems and a well qualified&#13;
staff of about  7,300.   Over the recent years  (1986-1994),  LBP has been&#13;
profitable, in both current and constant terms, with average net current earning&#13;
of about P900 million (about US$35 million) annually. In all these years, except&#13;
1989, LBP's net income was sufficient to more than maintain the real value of its&#13;
equity, the real rate of return averaged at 5%.  At 1994 year-end LBP had a&#13;
substantial capital base, totaling over RIO billion (over US$385 million) , or 10o&#13;
of its total assets.  LBP has maintained a cautious exposure policy, and its&#13;
total risk assets to capital ratio at 1994 year-end amounted to 4.4:1. To ensure&#13;
LBP's financial strength, it would maintain, during project implementation, the&#13;
following financial indicators: (i) Risk Assets to Net Equity Ratio of not more&#13;
than 8:1; (ii) Liquid Assets to Short-term Deposits of not less than 45%; (iii)&#13;
profitability in real terms during any consecutive three year period; and (iv)&#13;
ARF arrears associated with LBP's land compensation bonds and cash payments would&#13;
not exceed 10% of LBP's equity or P1 billion, whichever is lower. Agreement to&#13;
these  effects  was  obtained  at negotiations  (para.  6.1(f)}.    A  detailed&#13;
description of LBP's operation and performance is provided in Annex 2.1.&#13;
Specific implementation arrangements are discussed below.&#13;
B. Credit Operations&#13;
4.2       Credit operations would be carried out by the Wholesale Lending&#13;
Department for the Countryside Loan Fund (CLF) and the Retail Lending Department&#13;
for the Retail Cofinancing Fund (RCF). The CLF and the RCF units would handle&#13;
day-to-day implementation of the CLF II and the RCF operations. While overall&#13;
responsibility of the credit component would rest with LBP, the responsibility&#13;
to implement the CLF II and the RCF would rest with LBP's Program Lending&#13;
Department and the Branch Banking Group, respectively.&#13;
4.3       The CLF unit would onlend wholesale project funds to the PFIs and&#13;
provide them, as necessary, with technical assistance on CLF operation. It would&#13;
process sub-loan applications from PFIs; provide guidelines to PFIs on sub-&#13;
project selection and appraisal; carry out selective end-use verification of sub-&#13;
projects funded by the CLF; monitor sub-project performance; conduct training&#13;
with PFIs; manage the overall CLF relationship with the PFIs; and liaise closely&#13;
with the RCF unit to ensure proper implementation of its lending program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
4.4       Credit Operating Policies and Procedures.  Under the proposed project&#13;
LBP would continue to enhance its capabilities as a second tier bank. The credit&#13;
operation (CLF II and RCF) would be carried out on the basis of policies and&#13;
procedures established in Policy Manuals (PMs) for CLF II and RCF, to be approved&#13;
by LBP's Board, and satisfactory to the Bank.  The PMs would be periodically&#13;
updated to reflect necessary policy changes. Policies to be incorporated under&#13;
this loan are outlined below (paras. 4.5 to 4.20) and will be incorporated in the&#13;
respective PM. The adoption and implementation of the PMs, satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank would be conditions of loan effectiveness {para. 6.2(ii)}.   Key policy&#13;
issues discussed below include: eligibility criteria for CLF and RCF resources&#13;
(paras. 4.5 and 4.6); interest rate structure and foreign exchange coverage fee&#13;
(paras. 4.7 to 4.9); PFIs accreditation criteria (paras. 4.10 and 4.11); sub-&#13;
projects appraisal (paras. 4.12) sub-project review and disbursements (para.&#13;
4.13); sub-loan rescheduling (para. 4.14); sub-loan maturities  (para. 4.15);&#13;
environmental protection (para. 4.16); and supervision of CLF and RCF sub-loans&#13;
(paras. 4.17 to 4.19); accounting and audit arrangements (para. 4.20). During&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached on (i) the inclusion of the above features,&#13;
when applicable, in the PMs; and (ii) that the PMs would not be revised without&#13;
prior consultation with and approval of the Bank (para. 6.1(g)).&#13;
Eligibility Criteria&#13;
4.5          Sub-borrowers under CLF II and RCF will be limited to private sector&#13;
individuals or enterprises, provided that CLF's and RCF's total exposure under&#13;
sub-loans to any single borrower does not exceed 5% of LBP's equity. Eligible&#13;
investment would be medium and long term private investment financed for the&#13;
establishment of new enterprises, expansion of existing enterprises or&#13;
reinvestment in existing enterprises.   All agricultural and rural industries&#13;
based projects would be eligible, including fisheries, agro-industries, and&#13;
agricultural service enterprises. To qualify, proposed sub-projects would have&#13;
to be appraised by the PFIs or LBP (for RCF's sub-projects) as technically&#13;
feasible, financially viable, environmentally sound, and in the case of larger&#13;
investment sub-projects exceeding US$1 million equivalent, economically&#13;
justified.&#13;
4.6       Project medium and long term investment financing is extended to&#13;
basically support private small and medium-sized firms in the rural sector, which&#13;
do not presently have easy access to funds over one year's duration for real new&#13;
investments. Project funds would finance investments in fixed assets such as new&#13;
buildings and machinery and incremental working capital (measured in real terms,&#13;
excluding the inflation element of stocks). Land, existing buildings, or other&#13;
assets previously used within the rural sector (except breeding livestock) would&#13;
be ineligible. Under CLF II the PFIs would be required to provide, for each sub-&#13;
project, at least 10% of the financing package from their own funds. The minimum&#13;
equity contribution by the sub-borrower would be determined by the PFIs and LBP&#13;
(for RCF sub-borrowers) on the basis of its sub-project appraisal, but should not&#13;
be less than 15%. Bank financing of any single sub-project, under CLF II, would&#13;
not exceed, in any case, 75% of sub-project costs. Sub-projects, under the RCF&#13;
credit program, would be financed jointly by LBP and private financial&#13;
institution and the Bank. Bank financing of any single sub-project, under RCF,&#13;
would not  exceed  42.5%  of  sub-project  cost.    LBP  and private  financial&#13;
institution share in financing a RCF sub-project wculd be at least 42.5% of the&#13;
respective sub-project costs. Cofinancing of private financial institution would&#13;
be at least 75% of the cofinancing package or 32% of sub-project costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
Interest Rates&#13;
4.7       GOP has made important improvements over the past several years to&#13;
eliminate distortions and ensure that resource allocation and mobilization would&#13;
be driven by market forces. Consequently, there has been a departure from the&#13;
previous mechanism which set interest rates through administrative procedures.&#13;
Financial institutions are now allowed to set competitive interest rates freely,&#13;
both for deposits and for loans.  Under the proposed project, interest rates&#13;
would: (a) be in line with market rates, as required by GOP policy; (b) in line&#13;
with interest rate arrangements under the latest and on going Bank credit loans&#13;
to LBP and DBP; and (c) cover the Bank's interest rates and the foreign exchange&#13;
risk related costs.  It is not likely that the smaller borrowers who are not&#13;
direct or indirect exporters would be in a position to bear the foreign exchange&#13;
risks and therefore, would be offered loans in domestic currency. The attendant&#13;
foreign exchange risk of Peso lending to these sub-borrowers would be borne by&#13;
the Government in exchange for market related fee payable by LBP.   Foreign&#13;
exchange risk of US dollar onlending would be borne by the sub-borrowers. In both&#13;
cases (US dollar and Peso sub-loans) the system would allow free negotiations&#13;
between LBP and PFIs, on the one hand, and between PFIs, including LBP with&#13;
regard to sub-loans under the RCF, and the final borrowers on the other, to set&#13;
rates which reflect market forces and risks involved.&#13;
4.8       The onlending interest rates charged by LBP to the PFIs for the peso&#13;
sub-loan operation would be variable and adjustable every quarter. It would be&#13;
based on the 91 day Treasury Bill (T-Bill) rate (as applied under latest and on&#13;
going Bank credit loans to LBP and DBP). The Philippine financial market does&#13;
not have any benchmarks for the medium to long-term end of the yield curve. At&#13;
the short-term end of the yield curve, the 91 day T-Bill is the most actively&#13;
traded security in the market; close to P400 billion as of the end of 1992. The&#13;
91-day T-Bill rate is considered a better benchmark than the 60-91 day weighted&#13;
average deposit rate, because it reflects better the opportunity costs to a&#13;
financial intermediary. Sub-borrowers would be given a choice of a fixed rate&#13;
(the prevailing variable rate plus a premium) for several years or a variable&#13;
interest rate periodically adjusted.   The fixed onlending rate,  for those&#13;
borrowers who select this option, would be equal to either (i) the rates&#13;
resulting from the current formula1; or (ii) the equivalent long-term market&#13;
rates (i.e., term lending fixed rates of insurance or other financial companies,&#13;
or domestic bond market rates). Interest rates charged by LBP to the PFIs for&#13;
US Dollar subsidiary loans would be market rate and as such could offer variable&#13;
or fixed rates. Market rate would be based on the cost of funds to LBP (Bank&#13;
charges) plus an adequate spread to cover cost of GOP guarantee , operating&#13;
costs, and associated risk of LBP and PFIs. These arrangements would be subject&#13;
to periodic review as necessary but at least once a year.&#13;
4.9       Fee for Coverage of Foreign Exchange Risks.  When onlending in Peso&#13;
under the CLF II operation, the difference between the 91 day T-Bill rate and the&#13;
World Bank loan costs, minus LBP's spread of 2% (to cover LBP's wholesale&#13;
1/   The fixed rate under the current formula is the variable rate at the time&#13;
of the fixing plus a charge of 2%, 3% or 3,5% per annum, depending on the&#13;
sub-loan maturity left (1-3 years, more than 3-5 years, and more than 5-8&#13;
years, respectively).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
operating costs) would be passed on to DOF. This amount is intended to cover the&#13;
foreign exchange risks and the guarantee fee. It should be noted, however, that&#13;
given that the T-Bill rate is market-determined, there cannot be a guarantee that&#13;
the fees passed on to the DOF would always be sufficient to cover the foreign&#13;
exchange risks involved, especially in times when there is excess liquidity.&#13;
Nevertheless, given that the T-Bill rate reflects an active market and there do&#13;
not seem to be major distortions, it is expected that over longer periods of&#13;
time--provided that monetary policy is balanced--this formula would provide an&#13;
adequate fee to the Government for undertaking the foreign exchange risks.&#13;
PFI Accreditation Criteria&#13;
4.10      Accreditation criteria of Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs)&#13;
should ensure that three fundamental aspects are complied with: solvency,&#13;
profitability, and quality of ownership and management.   Criteria need to be&#13;
credible, transparent, unequivocal, and compatible with sound and generally&#13;
accepted financial principles and with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)&#13;
regulations. While accessory factors could be taken into account for fine tuning&#13;
purposes (e.g. reviewing LBP's credit ceiling limits), care would be exercised&#13;
to avoid deviation from the main criteria.   The following types of Financial&#13;
Institutions (FIs) would be allowed to participate in the CLF II operation,&#13;
provided that they meet the financial and administrative criteria: Universal,&#13;
Commercial, Rural, Thrift, and Cooperative Rural banks, including non-bank&#13;
financial institutions such as Investment and Trust Corporations, Stock Savings&#13;
and Loan Associations, and Rural Credit Unions.&#13;
(a) BSP Banking Regulations. Eligible FIs would comply with all BSP&#13;
regulations, particularly those related to the review of loan&#13;
portfolio and other risk assets, definition of past due loan&#13;
accounts, loan classifications, and adequate provision for&#13;
expected loan losses.&#13;
(b) Solvency Requirements. Eligible FIs would comply with a minimum&#13;
net equity base of at least 10% of their risk assets. The net&#13;
equity base would be computed applying the criteria established&#13;
by BSP, at the time of accreditation.&#13;
(c) Profitability Requirements. Eligible FIs would demonstrate their&#13;
profitability in real terms during the life of the sub-loans. To&#13;
calculate it the following method should be used: the Nominal&#13;
Profits (NP) should be adjusted, using the procedure indicated by&#13;
the International Accounting Standard No. 29.  If the adjusted&#13;
profit obtained is positive, then it would be considered that the&#13;
real profitability  criteria have been met.   The adjustments&#13;
proposed to the nominal profits would simply be two: (i) the&#13;
initial equity multiplied by the annual inflation would be&#13;
deducted from the nominal profits; and (ii) the initial fixed&#13;
assets multiplied by the annual inflation would be added to the&#13;
nominal profits.   If the resulting number is positive then it&#13;
would be accepted that the real profitability has been positive.&#13;
A financial intermediary complying with all other requirements&#13;
except real profitability would be qualified provided that&#13;
concurrence would be obtained in advance from the Bank.   While&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
such an exception may be required, it would need to be qualified&#13;
for exceptional cases such as when a PFI has taken write-offs&#13;
accruing to several past years or when the negative real&#13;
profitability has been an exception and financial projections&#13;
clearly demonstrate that in the future the PFI would make real&#13;
profits.&#13;
(d) Ownership and Management Ouality Requirement.   Ownership and&#13;
management quality should be satisfactory to LBP.   This would&#13;
include qualified management team of good reputation, presence of&#13;
adequate and qualified staff, sound operation policies and&#13;
procedures, compliance with all relevant laws, decrees and&#13;
regulations.&#13;
(e) Banks Underqoing Financial  Rehabilitation.    Banks  undergoing&#13;
financial rehabilitation should not become eligible until actual&#13;
rehabilitation has taken place, permitting them to fully comply&#13;
with the three main criteria under (a), (b), and (c) above.&#13;
4.11      In the event that a PFI loses its accreditation status (having failed&#13;
to meet one or more of the accreditation criteria), then LBP would: (i) cancel&#13;
the uncommitted portion of the line of credit granted to the PFI; (ii) take the&#13;
necessary actions to safeguard the committed portion extended to the said PFI;&#13;
and (iii) notify the Bank on actions taken.&#13;
4.12      Sub-project   Appraisals.       Sub-loan  appraisals   would  be   the&#13;
responsibility of the PFIs and LBP for the RCF sub-loans, whose capability would&#13;
be determined by LBP according to CLF qualifying criteria. Appraisals of medium-&#13;
and long-term sub-loans would be based upon the technical and financial features&#13;
of the sub-projects. For each medium- and long-term sub-loan, the PFI and LBP&#13;
(for RCF sub-loans) would prepare a financial plan including the sub-project's&#13;
cash flow. The PFI, and LBP for RCF, shall estimate a financial rate of return&#13;
(FRR) for all sub-projects with sub-loans of more than P5 million (US$200,000)&#13;
equivalent. For the sub-projects to be acceptable, the real FRR shall be greater&#13;
than the real interest rate of the sub-loan. LBP would ensure that an estimation&#13;
of an economic rate of return (ERR) would also be carr,ied out for all sub-&#13;
projects with sub-loans of more than US$1 million equivalent. These sub-projects&#13;
should yield an ERR of not less than 12% in real terms or any other rate&#13;
established from time to time by NEDA. To reduce the credit risk and minimize&#13;
the sub-borrowers' foreign exchange risk, the appraisals of sub-projects under&#13;
the SCL program would have to ensure that US dollar sub-loans be offered only to&#13;
those sub-borrowers, regardless of their size, who: (a) are direct and indirect&#13;
exporters and have a need for a single currency loan to match revenues earned in&#13;
or tied to foreign exchange; and (b) have the capability to manage the risks&#13;
associated with the foreign currency compositions of their assets and&#13;
liabilities.   When onlending in either Pesos or US dollars, the sub-project&#13;
appraisals also would include an analysis of the appropriateness of the interest&#13;
rate basis, whether fixed or variable, for the needs of the respective sub-&#13;
project.&#13;
4.13      Sub-proiect's Review and Disbursements.  As under the first operation,&#13;
LBP would receive the sub-project credit evaluation carried out by the PFI in all&#13;
cases. On an ex-ante basis--before disbursing--LBP would review a summary of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
appraisal work prepared by the PFI, so as to ascertain that the sub-projects are&#13;
consistent with CLF II guidelines, in which case it would authorize the&#13;
respective disbursements. LBP would grant up to 45 days to PFIs to submit sub-&#13;
loan documentation and evidence of payments and procurement. LBP would declare&#13;
the sub-loans due and demandable and charge a penalty fee if PFIs do not submit&#13;
the required documentation within the 45 day period after LBP's disbursements or&#13;
if the submitted documentation does not satisfactorily support sub-projects that&#13;
are eligible under CLF II. In any case, LBP would maintain rights to visit sub-&#13;
projects after the sub-loan disbursements have been made. Bank concurrence would&#13;
be required for all sub-loans above US$3 million equivalent.  Disbursements to&#13;
the PFIs would be subject to compliance with both pre-release and post-release&#13;
documentation required. Proceeds would be credited to an account opened with LBP&#13;
for this purpose. If a PFI advances a sub-loan release to a sub-borrower, the&#13;
PFI can apply for rediscounting from CLF II within 90 days after the date of&#13;
advance. On the other hand, the PFIs must release the full proceeds to the sub-&#13;
borrowers within 15 working days of the receipt from LBP.&#13;
4.14      Sub-loan Rescheduling.  The PFIs would be required to repay the sub-&#13;
loans to LBP whether or not corresponding repayments have been received from the&#13;
sub-borrowers. Thus, sub-loan rescheduling would not be allowed under CLF II.&#13;
However, in case that there have been losses or damages caused from fortuitous&#13;
events  or  'force majeure'  (e.g.,  typhoons,  earthquakes)  LBP may consider&#13;
restructuring the PFIs consolidated debt to LBP, so as to accommodate the PFI's&#13;
debt servicing capacity.   Rescheduling of sub-loans under the RCF would be&#13;
allowed only in cases where rescheduling would substantially improve the ability&#13;
of the sub-borrower to service his debts.&#13;
4.15      Sub-loan Maturities.  The repayment period for CLF II's  and RCF's&#13;
medium- and long-term sub-loans will be based upon the sub-project's cash flow&#13;
and the sub-borrower's overall repayment capability. Repayment of most sub-loans&#13;
would be within five to ten years, but would not exceed fifteen years or the pay-&#13;
back period of the sub-project, whichever is shorter. Reasonable grace periods&#13;
may be granted by LBP for the repayment of the principal based upon the sub-&#13;
project's cash flow projections and the sub-borrower's repayment capability.&#13;
Maturity of PFI and the cofinancing (LBP and private financial institution)&#13;
participation under CLF II and RCF, respectively, would conform to the maturity&#13;
of the related sub-loan.&#13;
Environment&#13;
4.16      LBP will specify that sub-borrowers for CLF II and RCF funded projects&#13;
should comply with all laws and regulations of the Philippines related to&#13;
environmental protection, consistent with environmental guidelines of the Bank.&#13;
LBP would be in charge of supervising compliance. To reduce the risk that sub-&#13;
projects with undesirable environmental or social impacts would be financed by&#13;
CLF II or RCF, the following measures would be taken. All sub-projects would&#13;
comply with the Presidential Decree 1586 and its 1992 regulations which describes&#13;
the Philippine  environmental legal requirements for new investments, or the&#13;
latest prevailing environmental laws and regulations which would be in force&#13;
during sub-project processing. An Environmental Unit (EU) has been established&#13;
within LBP to provide LBP, PFIs, and related sub-projects with environmental&#13;
technical assistance and coordination services. The EU would be staffed by a&#13;
core of professional and administrative assistants, supported by qualified&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
consultants which would be providing periodic short term services. In addition,&#13;
the EU would be responsible for the implementation of the training program for&#13;
the project related staff in LBP and the PFIs.   This program would include&#13;
courses on environmental issues to increase CLF related staff capacity to review&#13;
and monitor environmental aspects of sub-projects. Also, and in light of EMB's&#13;
and DENR's manpower difficulties, the EU with the support of the Bank, would&#13;
accredit consultancy firms to review and provide EIS and recommendations with&#13;
regard to sub-projects. These consultants would extend the following services:&#13;
(i) provide environmental scoping; (ii) review project descriptions and EIS&#13;
prepared by sub borrowers; (iii) prepare descriptions and EISs for sub-borrowers&#13;
which do not posses the technical capability to undertake them; and (iv) follow&#13;
up and accelerate processing of applications within the clearing and permitting&#13;
system of DENR and EMB. The list of accredited consultants was submitted for&#13;
Bank review on August 19, 1994 and would be updated and reviewed annually.&#13;
Assurances to these effects were obtained during negotiations {para. 6.1(h)}.&#13;
Detailed description of the EU activities is provided in Annex 4.1.&#13;
Proiect Supervision&#13;
4.17      Supervision of Sub-projects.  The supervision of the sub-loans would&#13;
be the responsibility of the PFIs and LBP for RCF sub-loans, with the&#13;
requirements that specific officers would be designated for this purpose. PFIs&#13;
and LBP would ensure through supervision that sub-borrowers use CLF II and RCF&#13;
funds (the FUNDS) only for the approved purposes. This would be achieved through&#13;
direct payments to suppliers of inputs and materials--as practicable--and through&#13;
a careful follow up of funds application.   In fact,  as LBP would receive&#13;
documentation and evidence of procurement after disbursements, LBP would have an&#13;
adequate basis for determining whether or not the FUNDS have been used for&#13;
approved purposes. Furthermore, sub-project visits would be a normal part of the&#13;
supervision process.   PFIs  and LBP would also obtain periodic operating and&#13;
financial reports from sub-borrowers and LBP would conduct selective end-use&#13;
verification of funded sub-projects.  In this manner, LBP would issue an annual&#13;
assessment of the overall financial condition of the PFIs and shall use such&#13;
findings in the annual renewal of PFI accreditation under CLF II. Thus, the PFIs&#13;
would be required to submit and LBP to obtain (with regard to RCF) such&#13;
reports--as prescribed by LBP (CLF Unit) from time to time--that allow LBP to&#13;
properly monitor the PFI's (including AMG unit within LBP), sub-loan appraisal,&#13;
disbursement and supervision processes and capabilities.&#13;
4.18      LBP Supervision of PFIs would be a permanent effort.   A monitoring&#13;
system to enable LBP to take corrective measures as soon as possible has been&#13;
established under the first CLF.  This system would be used to monitor PFIs'&#13;
performance under the proposed project. LBP's supervision will focus on sub-loan&#13;
promotion, appraisal, disbursements, and recovery, as well as sub-project&#13;
supervision by the PFIs.   The overall financial conditions of PFIs would be&#13;
assessed and findings and recommendations included in comprehensive annual&#13;
supervision reports to be prepared by LBP on each of the PFIs. Also, LBP would&#13;
prepare an annual report on PFIs, summarizing their overall conditions and main&#13;
issues affecting the principal categories of PFIs (KBs, TBs, and RBs) .  This&#13;
annual report would also include technical assistance as well as remedial action&#13;
recommendations to enhance the financial, technical, administrative and&#13;
developmental conditions of PFIs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
4.19      Supervision of LBP's operations would be carried out through analysis&#13;
of its periodic reports to the Bank, concerning: (a) CLF's and RCF's sub-loans&#13;
amounts outstanding and their main features, including their recovery status; (b)&#13;
sub-loan applications pending LBP's appraisal results, approval, disbursements,&#13;
and recoveries; (c) LBP's financial condition as reflected in its financial&#13;
statements, review by independent external auditors satisfactory to the Bank; (d)&#13;
PFIs' financial conditions as reflected in by LBP's analysis of the quality of&#13;
their loan portfolio, their loan collection capabilities and their compliance&#13;
with BSP's regulations on portfolio classification and loan provisioning; and (e)&#13;
the project's accounts (CLF II and RCF), including audited Statement of&#13;
Expenditures  (SOEs)  and Special Account.    Bank  supervision missions  will&#13;
complement LBP's analysis and enable a more through assessment of LBP's financial&#13;
condition, operations, and fulfillment of reporting requirements (Annex 3.3).&#13;
LBP would be required to maintain separate accounts for ALF, CLF I, CLF II, and&#13;
RCF. LBP would also prepare an annual assessment of CLF II and RCF operations&#13;
and financial conditions, plus its recommendations, if appropriate, on how to&#13;
further enhance the project's efficiency and developmental role.&#13;
Accounting and Audit Arrangements for Project-Related Disbursements&#13;
4.20      The PFIs and LBP (for RCF) would be required to maintain adequate&#13;
records and accounting of CLF II sub-loans that are satisfactory to CLF Unit&#13;
within LBP, especially to accurately reflect balances and movements in the CLF&#13;
II and RCF sub-loans.   PFIs would also be required to furnish their audited&#13;
financial statements,  at least annually.   The external auditors should be&#13;
acceptable to LBP and the format of the report should be satisfactory to LBP.&#13;
LBP would communicate its requirements on external audits of PFIs in a timely&#13;
manner, so as to allow the external auditors to know in advance about LBP needs,&#13;
especially those related to PFI eligibility accreditation requirements under&#13;
CLF II.&#13;
C. Institutional Strengthening Component&#13;
4.21      LBP would be responsible for implementing the agreed Institutional&#13;
Strengthening Action Plan (ISAP). The action plan would be annually reviewed and&#13;
if warranted, adjustments to the respective strategy, actions, and targets would&#13;
be made.   In addition a semi-annual report on the outstanding issues and&#13;
implementation of the ISAP would be prepared by LBP and would include its various&#13;
departments involved in implementing the ISAP. Agreement to these effects was&#13;
obtained at negotiations (para. 6.1(e)}. Details on the principles, targets, and&#13;
timetable regarding the implementation of the ISAP are provided in the Working&#13;
Paper and in Annex 4.2.&#13;
4.22      Training and Technical Assistance Program.  LBP would be responsible&#13;
for the preparation and implementation of the project training and Technical&#13;
Assistance (TA) programs. The preparation work would be completed and carried&#13;
out by December 15, 1995 (see Annex 4.3 for details).  The programs would be&#13;
updated annually.   During negotiations agreement was obtained that:  (i) the&#13;
training program would be sent to the Bank for review by December 31, 1995, and&#13;
thereafter the updated one for each fiscal year by November 30, of each year; and&#13;
(ii) LBP will employ consultants whose qualifications, experience, and terms and&#13;
conditions are satisfactory to the Bank {para. 6.1(i) and (j)}.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
V. PROJECT IMPACT, BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
Impact and Benefits&#13;
5.1       LBP. Under its present operating arrangements LBP has the motivation,&#13;
financial and institutional strength to absorb the proposed incremental funding&#13;
to be provided under the project.   The total incremental funding to be made&#13;
available to LBP is equivalent to about 5% of its total assets as of year end&#13;
1993. However, this funding would have an important impact on LBP's long-term&#13;
capital in that it would increase total equity and long-term borrowing by about&#13;
25% (excluding funds specifically supporting land reform), thereby helping to&#13;
reduce LBP's heavy dependence on short-term government deposits.  The RCF would&#13;
benefit LBP in enabling it to offer medium and long term loans to its own retail&#13;
clients. It would also help in developing LBP's cofinancing skills. Detailed&#13;
projections of LBP's future financial statements are set out in Annex 5.1. The&#13;
spread which LBP is able to make from onlending of project funds would have a&#13;
modest positive impact on LBP's profit and loss account, equivalent to perhaps&#13;
5% of its present net profit.&#13;
5.2       Implementation of the comprehensive Institutional Strengthening Action&#13;
Plan (ISAP) would enhance LBP's resources, further strengthen its operational&#13;
effectiveness and cause it to be more transparent and realistic in accounting for&#13;
its operations including the level of provisioning to cover possible losses in&#13;
its agrarian loan portfolio.   The technical assistance and training programs&#13;
within LBP would both assist in improving operational effectiveness and reduce&#13;
costs, particularly in LBP's agrarian sector operations within which field office&#13;
staff would be upgraded. Furthermore, as a result of the focus on cooperative&#13;
training, the level of inputs required of LBP to support its cooperative clients,&#13;
would be reduced.   Increased mobilization of long-term funds in the domestic&#13;
market, either through issuing bonds or through wholesaling packages of its&#13;
guaranteed loans, would complement direct borrowing under the project, and help&#13;
to match resources to loans better.&#13;
5.3       Agreements achieved during final project preparation concerning LBP's&#13;
land compensation responsibility would reduce uncertainties with regard to its&#13;
future  financial  strength.    Of particular  benefit  to  LBP  would  be  the&#13;
finalization of measures to formally transfer ultimate responsibility for&#13;
agrarian reform financing to government, thereby shielding LBP from risk that&#13;
land reform operations may not be fully funded. Secondly, implementation of the&#13;
dividend policy in the manner agreed during appraisal would remove the risk that&#13;
LBP might otherwise be required to pay dividends resulting in capital reduction&#13;
in real terms.&#13;
5.4       Financial Intermediaries.  PFIs and particularly RFIs would benefit&#13;
from the increased availability of funds under the CLF operation as well as from&#13;
the TA which would help train their staff in project identification, formulation,&#13;
and appraisal. The availability of long-term funds to the PFIs would allow them&#13;
to have an improved balance with regard to their assets and liabilities.&#13;
Borrowed funds would be more evenly matched with respect to loan maturity period&#13;
than would be the case without the project. The-known availability of additional&#13;
CLF funds would encourage participation of a wider range of qualified PFIs.&#13;
Those participating would actively seek to promote investments needing long-term&#13;
financing rather than to restrict their focus and efforts on providing short-term&#13;
financing for trading. As a result of CLF II funding coming onstream, growing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
numbers of cooperating institutions would be able to expand their long-term&#13;
lending activities rather than contracting, or seeking other sources of finance&#13;
as would have been necessary if no second CLF tranche were available. The RCF&#13;
would provide the FIs with the opportunity to participate in term financing with&#13;
minimal credit risk, and therefore would be of particular benefit to FIs with&#13;
high liquidity seeking alternative investments to Treasury Bills.&#13;
5.5       End-borrowers in rural areas would benefit significantly from the&#13;
project through the increase of long-term capital availability at market rates.&#13;
It is clear that the present volume of medium and long term loan capital&#13;
available in the Philippines rural areas is very small compared with the level&#13;
of investments and borrowing needed (para 1.9). This has tended to result in&#13;
borrowers taking short-term loans and rolling them over rather than having firm&#13;
longer term commitments from the financial institutions with whom they deal. The&#13;
need for annual roll-over of loans places the borrowers in a weaker position vis-&#13;
a-vis the financial intermediary than in the case when the term and the amount&#13;
of the loan can be determined at the outset of the project. Consequently, the&#13;
availability of long-term financing will encourage more investments than would&#13;
have otherwise been the case.   The selection of US dollars for the single&#13;
currency portion of the loan would benefit the sub-borrowers of this portion by&#13;
providing them with the currency of their expected revenues. This would enable&#13;
the sub-borrowers to reduce their foreign exchange risk by providing a better&#13;
match between their US dollar revenue and expenses.&#13;
5.6       Rural Poverty and Overall Economic Impact.  On the basis of past&#13;
experience, CLF and RCF resources (the FUNDS) are likely to be used for a wide&#13;
range of rural sector investments including agriculture, livestock, agro-&#13;
processing, rural manufacturing, as well as service industries in the rural areas&#13;
such as transport and shipping.   Sustained sectoral growth,  combined with&#13;
increased employment opportunities outside the agriculture sector in rural areas&#13;
will be indispensable to reduce rural poverty in the years to come. The project&#13;
would assist in achieving these goals through the provision of needed term&#13;
lending facilities for financing private rural development activities.   The&#13;
project would help to finance about 2,000 investment sub-projects at a minimum&#13;
total  cost  of  about  US$260  million,   including  sub-borrowers'   equity&#13;
contribution.' These sub-projects are expected to generate an incremental US$55&#13;
million annually in gross value added and create about 20,000 new jobs.&#13;
Incremental employment would mostly be for low skilled rural workers, many of&#13;
whom would be women, which would be an important factor in reducing rural&#13;
poverty. Since the precise mix of the sub-project lending would depend on market&#13;
demand, the quantification of an aggregate economic impact is not possible ex-&#13;
ante. The free market ecoifomy in the Philippines and the system of effective&#13;
taxes on financial intermediaries, together with aggressive borrowing by&#13;
Government, has resulted in financial interest rates which are substantially&#13;
positive in real terms at the sub-borrower level.   Because of this, private&#13;
investors would normally invest in projects from which they expect to generate&#13;
a high real financial rate of return.   This coupled with the relative and&#13;
decreasing distortion between financial and economic prices suggests that&#13;
investments supported by the FUNDS would also show attractive economic rates of&#13;
l/    If sub-borrowers contribute 30% of project costs, and PFIs 12% as in CLF&#13;
I, project costs would total US$293 million with CLF II increasing to&#13;
US$207 million, and RCF to US$86 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
return. Estimated economic rates of return on those sub projects for which ERRs&#13;
were calculated in the project completion report of the first Rural Finance&#13;
Project/CLF I (Loan 3356-PH) averaged about 35' compared with FRRs for the same&#13;
sub-projects of 30%. Similar results could be anticipated under CLF II, but with&#13;
a smaller difference between ERRs and FRRs.&#13;
5.7       Risks.  The main risks associated with this type of program relate to&#13;
possible delays and/or inadequate implementation. The principal concern on the&#13;
implementation side is that the introduction of agreed policy measures could be&#13;
thwarted or postponed by political considerations, thereby weakening LBP as a&#13;
financial institution and reducing its capacity to effectively implement both the&#13;
lending programs under the project and its own institutional strengthening action&#13;
plan. These risks would be mitigated through a gradual implementation process&#13;
agreed upon and formalized through dated covenants in the legal documents. With&#13;
respect to the credit component, the demand will be subject to overall&#13;
performance of the economy.  The demand for CLF and RCF resources, during the&#13;
project period, is projected conservatively and is well within the historical&#13;
growth performance of the first CLF.  The LIBOR basis rate on the SCL program&#13;
will add some volatility to the debt service of the respective sub-borrowers.&#13;
Care would be taken to ensure that sub-borrowers are capable to bear this risk.&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.1       During negotiations agreement was reached with Government and LBP on&#13;
the following:&#13;
(a) LBP would exclude itself from retailing CLF II resources (para.&#13;
3.4);&#13;
(b) LBP would operate CLF II and RCF (the FUNDS) on a commercial&#13;
basis and the latter's net profit would remain within the FUNDS&#13;
as LBP's investment (para. 3.8);&#13;
(c) Land acquired for redistribution and land reform mortgages would&#13;
be satisfactorily excluded from LBP's risk assets by December 31,&#13;
1995 {para. 3.9 (a) (ii)};&#13;
(d) LBP's dividend payments would be formulated in line with para.&#13;
3.9 (a) (iii);&#13;
(e) LBP would submit to the Bank: (i) quarterly progress report with&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
(g)  Policy Manuals  (PMs)  for CLF II and RCF would be  issued,&#13;
incorporating agreement with the Bank as noted below. Further&#13;
changes in the PMs for project lending would not be made without&#13;
the Bank's prior concurrence (para. 4.4);&#13;
(i)    eligibility criteria for CLF II and RCF loans, including&#13;
minimum funding requirements and equity contribution of&#13;
PFIs, LBP, and sub-borrowers, respectively (paras. 4.5 and&#13;
4.6);&#13;

detailed in para. 4.16;&#13;
(i) the project training program for 1996 would be submitted for Bank&#13;
review by December 15, 1995 and thereafter the updated program for&#13;
each fiscal year by November 30, of each year (para. 4.22); and&#13;
(j) LBP will employ consultants whose qualifications, experience, and&#13;
terms and conditions are satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.22)&#13;
6.2       Condition of Loan Effectiveness would be the approval by LBP's Board&#13;
of: (i) the Institutional Strengthening Action Plan; and (ii) the Policy Manuals&#13;
for CLF II and RCF (paras. 3.9 and 4.4).&#13;
6.3       Recommendation.  With the above agreement and assurances, the proposed&#13;
project is suitable for Bank loans totalling US$150 million equivalent to the&#13;
Land Bank of the Philippines with the guarantee of the Republic of the&#13;
Philippines.  The Currency Pool Loan and the US dollar Single Currency Loan at&#13;
variable rate would have a term of 20 years including five years of grace on&#13;
repayment of principal,  and carry the prevailing Bank's standard variable&#13;
interest rates for the basket currencies loan and the Bank's standard LIBOR-based&#13;
interest rate for US$ single currency loan.  The fixed rate US dollar single&#13;
currency loan would have a term of 15 years including three years of grace on&#13;
repayment of principal, and carry the prevailing Bank's standard fixed interest&#13;
rate for US dollar for 12 year maturity.&#13;

PHILIPPINES&#13;
SECOND RURAL FINANCE PROJECT&#13;
Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) Operation and Performance&#13;
Organization and Management&#13;
1.          The Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) was established in 1963 under&#13;
the 1963 Land Reform Code Act (RA3844) as the agency responsible for financing&#13;
agrarian reform.   Its ordinary share capital of P1.8 billion' has been fully&#13;
subscribed by the Government, but it has P1.2 billion of preference share capital&#13;
which is authorized, but not issued.    Since 1973, LBP has had full banking&#13;
powers, allowing it to receive demand, savings and time deposits without&#13;
limitation, and to engage in underwriting activities.&#13;
2.           In line with normal commercial bank practice, LBP is controlled by&#13;
a Board of Directors, which comprises seven members. These are the Secretary of&#13;
Finance, who is Chairman; the President of the Bank, who is Vice-Chairman; the&#13;
Secretary of Agrarian Reform; and the Secretary of Labor, all of whom are ex-&#13;
officio members. In addition, there are three Board members appointed by the&#13;
President of the Philippines to represent the agrarian reform beneficiaries, the&#13;
landowners and the private sector. The new Land Bank charter (Republic Act 7909)&#13;
now provided for LBP Board to be expanded to nine members. The Secretary of&#13;
Agriculture is added to the ex-officio representation and the other members are&#13;
increased to four of whom two are to represent land reform beneficiaries and two&#13;
the private sector.   Details of the organizational structure of the Bank are&#13;
shown in Appendix E, figures 1 - 4.&#13;
3.             Below the level of President, the operation of the Bank is divided&#13;
into three sectors: the Banking Sector, the Agrarian Sector, and the Operations&#13;
and Executive Sector.  The organizational structure of LBP reflects its dual&#13;
role. Its main operational divisions, Commercial Banking on the one hand, and&#13;
Agrarian on the other, are entirely separate, with separate staffing and separate&#13;
budgets. Furthermore, the outreach of the two sectors is through different&#13;
channels. Agrarian reaches out to farmers through its Regional and Field Offices&#13;
(of which there are 12 and 126 respectively), while the Banking Division does&#13;
most (over 80%) of its lending business through Head Office. Its 161 branches&#13;
are largely for collecting deposits and normally act only as conduits for loans,&#13;
decision making being largely centralized.   The only overlap between the two&#13;
sectors, at an operational level, is that the branches provide checking and&#13;
normal commercial banking facilities to the field offices, that is, advances made&#13;
by the field offices are paid out through LBP branches and collections of loans&#13;
are paid into LBP branches.&#13;
4.          LBP has grown rapidly in the past seven years, and now has about&#13;
7,800 staff. In the period December 1987 to the end of 1990, the main change was&#13;
1/ LBP's authorized ordinary share capital has recently been increased by Peso&#13;
6 billion to Peso 7.8 billion under the new Republic Act (RA)7909.&#13;
&#13;

in the agrarian sector where the number of field offices established rose from&#13;
29 to 91 and agrarian staff numbers increased by 135%. Little happened over this&#13;
period within the banking sector - branches increased only from 26 to 32, and&#13;
total staffing by 30%.  The next three years, however, saw a reversal in the&#13;
roles. There was a rapid expansion in the banking sector, with the number of&#13;
branches opened increasing to 161 (by 403%) and branch steff by 297%.  In the&#13;
agrarian sector though, the number of field offices increased more modestly from&#13;
91 to the present level of 126 (by 38%).  Field staff increased by 73% mainly&#13;
to bring existing offices up to their staff full complemeni.&#13;

5.         Agrarian Sector.  Until 1990, the most important part of LBP's&#13;
operation in the Agrarian Sector was the provision of Agrarian Reform Mortgage&#13;
Loans (ARMs) to individual farmers who have bought their land under the various&#13;
land reform programs. Currently LBP has outstanding ARMs of about P2 billion&#13;
(US$74 million). In addition it has land assets on its balance sheets, which are&#13;
intended to be transferred to beneficiaries and so turned into mortgage loan&#13;
assets of about P5.4 billion (US$200 million) .  Official plans are for an&#13;
expansion of land reform activities. Initial estimates were that between 1987&#13;
and 1997, P80 billion would be needed for the cost of land acquisition and&#13;
distribution. Given the long maturity of the associated loans to mortgagees,&#13;
this would have implied an expansion in mortgage lending on LBP's balance sheet&#13;
to a portfolio figure of well in excess of P70 billion at the end of 1997. A&#13;
reassessment of these figures, made in 1994, using LBP's own projections for land&#13;
acquisition, which are below those of the DAR, suggested an end 1998 level of&#13;
mortgages outstanding (or land for redistribution held by LBP) of P50 billion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 3 of 20&#13;
In either case, the level of agrarian reform mortgage operations would be large&#13;
compared with LBP's commercial operations, and would only be sustainable with&#13;
continued strong support from ARF (or other Government sources).&#13;
6.          LBP's contribution to the Land Reform Program is  (on behalf of&#13;
Government), to carry out surveys and valuations, arrange for payment of&#13;
landowners, operate a secondary market in Land Reform Bonds, and to administer&#13;
mortgages of land reform beneficiaries, including the collection of payments.&#13;
Because land reform financing is uneconomic, costing in discounted real terms&#13;
about US$820 per ha (paid for by ARF/Government), it is strongly recommended that&#13;
LBP continue to operate in this area only as an agent of Government and&#13;
consequently that the associated assets and liabilities are taken off LBP's&#13;
balance sheet.&#13;
7.          Since 1987, LBP has been operating a Countryside Development Program,&#13;
under which it provides loans for small farmers. It treats all farmers under 5&#13;
hectares (rice and corn farmers under seven hectares) as being agrarian reform&#13;
beneficiaries and until well into 1992 allocated the cost of loans to such&#13;
farmers to ARF. Initially LBP had extended loans to individual farmers whom it&#13;
dealt with in groups, but with whom it maintained individual accounts. Over the&#13;
past seven years however, LBP has changed its strategy, and now channels credit&#13;
to these borrowers on a wholesale basis through two main channels - agricultural&#13;
cooperatives and Rural Financial Institutions (RFIs) - mainly Rural Banks (RBs).&#13;
The importance of LBP's Countryside Development Program increased substantially&#13;
over the five years 1988-1992, but decreased slightly in 1993 and more&#13;
significantly in 1994. The level of disbursements in 1994 was P6 billion (US$222&#13;
million), down from a peak of P7.5 billion (US$277 million) in 1992. The main&#13;
reason for this drop was the reduction in lending to cooperatives (a 37% fall&#13;
from 1992-1994) largely as a result of applying a more prudent accreditation&#13;
criteria.&#13;

8.          Loans to cooperatives which up to 1991 were made using ARF funds&#13;
include Agricultural Production Loans, Commodity Loans, Operating Capital Loans,&#13;
Agricultural Facility (fixed asset) Loans, and Agro-Industrial Loans. Short term&#13;
loans carry an interest rate', which is currently positive in real terms, of 12%&#13;
1/    LBP interest rates are "simple interest rates" calculated on the basis of&#13;
the amount outstanding and the number of days. For short term loans to&#13;
farmers, interest is payable at the same time as loan repayment is due.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

per annum (plus a 2% service charge) and have maturity periods designed to&#13;
coincide with the crop cycle. In the case of fixed asset financing, the rate is&#13;
14% + 2% with maturity designed to match a reasonable pay-back period for the&#13;
asset, e.g. 3-7 years. In the case of crop loans, which account for about 70%&#13;
of all loans to cooperatives, LBP requires that the crops are insured by the&#13;
Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation (PCIC). Onlending rate from cooperatives&#13;
to members are determined by the coop itself.&#13;
9.          LBP also operates a small farmer re-discounting program for Rural&#13;
Banks (RBs), which must be accredited by LBP. Inter alia, they must have capital&#13;
of at least 10% of their risk assets, and a past due ratio of not more than 50%&#13;
(an easier requirement than that for Central Bank discounting which requires a&#13;
past due ratio of not more than 25%). About half of the 750 RBs fulfill these&#13;
criteria and are eligible for this LBP support.   Under this program,  LBP&#13;
establishes a line of credit with the RB, on the condition that the RB re-lends&#13;
the funds to small farmers or cooperatives who fulfil "agrarian criteria". These&#13;
lines of credit are issued to the banks on a one year basis, and may be re-lent&#13;
to beneficiaries on terms and conditions determined by the RB with a maximum re-&#13;
discount rate of 85%. The main constraint to the RB program's growth is that the&#13;
policies of the RBs are conservative.   RBs typically only lend on a fully&#13;
collateralized basis, generally using real estate as security.   The normal&#13;
requirement is for farmers to pledge real estate collateral worth at least double&#13;
the loan size.   This tends to exclude much of the rural community and is&#13;
particularly difficult for new agrarian reform beneficiaries, who cannot offer&#13;
land as security for loans from RBs because it is already mortgaged to LBP.&#13;
10.         In addition to operating its own programs using its own funds (or ARF&#13;
funds), LBP acts as an implementer of programs for other agencies including the&#13;
Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) and the Department of Agriculture (DA). The&#13;
total supervised credit funds administered by LBP are fairly small compared with&#13;
LBP's total agrarian funding (less than 10%), and in December 1993 amounted to&#13;
90.63 billion.&#13;
11.         Banking Sector   Like other commercial banks,  LBP lends to the&#13;
commercial sector on a range of terms and conditions, normally geared to a&#13;
minimum spread of about 4% over its marginal cost of money. However, it also&#13;
provides funds to clients from special sources, such as the Social Security Fund&#13;
and targeted lines from DBP. Under the Social Security Fund, funds are onlent&#13;
with a spread of 4% at a fixed interest of 16% for loans up to 5 years, and 17%&#13;
for loans over 5 years. These funds are earmarked for small and medium sized&#13;
businesses with an annual turnover in excess of P5 million and are limited to&#13;
P20 million per borrower. Total resources available to LBP from SSS are about&#13;
P0.5 billion.   DBP funding,  which is mainly funds of Japanese origin for&#13;
industrial or export lending, amounted to P0.3 billion at the end of 1993.&#13;
12.         Since  1990,  LBP  has  been  responsible  for  administering  the&#13;
Agricultural Loan Fund (ALF) and re-lending ALF recycled funds on a wholesale&#13;
basis. Initially, LBP managed over P2 billion under this program. Now, however,&#13;
most of these funds have been returned to the Central Bank. As at December 31st&#13;
1994, the outstanding balance of ALF funds in LBP amounted to R0.43 billion, (P88&#13;
million of which was lent out and the remainder held in short term instruments).&#13;
Repayments of outstanding CBP originated loans which are being collected by LBP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 5 of 20&#13;
should give rise to a further P0.19 billion.   With the support of the Rural&#13;
Finance Project (Loan 3356-PH), LBP has also been operating the Countryside Loan&#13;
Fund (CLF) to wholesale resources for lending in rural areas using borrowings&#13;
from the World Bank. By December 31st 1994, this loan had been fully drawn down.&#13;
These US$150 million of funds are wholesaled both to Commercial Banks and Rural&#13;
Banks with the pass on rate being determined by a market-linked formula. LBP&#13;
earns a spread of 21 for administering the program.  Total volume of outstanding&#13;
LBP loans supported by CLF at December 31st 1994 amounted P3.2 billion.&#13;
Loan Portfolio.&#13;
13.          Between December 1990 and December 1994, LBP increased its non-&#13;
interbank portfolio by about a factor of more than 4 in nominal terms  (see&#13;
Table 3).  This is also a substantial increase in real terms,  representing&#13;
average real growth of some 301 p.a. over the past four years.&#13;

Lending to private non-agricultural businesses grew by the equivalent of 88% p.a.&#13;
throughout this period and its relative importance increased from 24% of LBP's&#13;
portfolio in 1990, to 441 in 1994. Agriculture (including ARMs, small farmer&#13;
production loans and loans to agribusiness) is still an important sector funded&#13;
by LBP, with P16.6 billion outstanding (45% of portfolio) in December 1994. The&#13;
total amount of loans to agriculture grew by an average of 28% p.a. between&#13;
December 1990 and December 1994, somewhat less than the average of all loans.&#13;
A 45t p.a. increase in loans outstanding to small farmers was tempered by growth&#13;
in the commercial agriculture portfolio of 26% and virtually no growth in ARMs.&#13;
Lending to government entities grew by the equivalent of 51% p.a. overall in this&#13;
period.  In December 1994, the total outstanding to government of P3.3 billion,&#13;
absorbed 16% of total portfolio. Finally, LBP remains a financier of livelihood&#13;
projects. Its portfolio of these, (government subsidized directed credit to fund&#13;
livelihood projects) , increased by a modest 1% p.a. between 1990 and 1994 and is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
Annex 2.1&#13;
Page 6 of 20&#13;
now only 2% of LBP's portfolio. Many of these loans, which are underwritten by&#13;
Government, are now past due.&#13;
14.         Loan data  from LBP's balance  sheet  (Appendix A),  detailed in&#13;
Appendix B shows that overall, LBP's loan portfolio, including interbank loans,&#13;
has increased from a gross figure of P9.7 billion as at December 1990 to&#13;
P38.4 billion in December 1994. After taking account of provisions for probable&#13;
losses, which have increased from P613 million to P1.8 billion but reduced as a&#13;
percentage of gross loans from 6.3% to 4.6t, net loans amounted to P9.1 billion&#13;
in December 1990, and P36.6 billion in December 1994. Overall, the proportion&#13;
of net loans either past due or in litigation improved, from 7.0% in 1990 to 1.5%&#13;
in December 1993, before deteriorating to 5.2% in December 1994. It should be&#13;
noted that following an agreement with BSP it is LBP's policy not to classify&#13;
ARMs as past due, even though payments on over half of these are behind schedule.&#13;
If these mortgage loans are excluded from the calculation, (both from the&#13;
numerator, and the denominator) , then net non-performing loins as percentages of&#13;
net total loans were 9.0% in 1988 improving to 1.9% in 1993 but deteriorating to&#13;
5.6% in 1994  (Appendix C).   The satisfactory situation with regard to the&#13;
reduction of net past dues up to 1993 was partly offset by a substantial increase&#13;
in loan restructuring in the agrarian sector, mainly as a result of natural&#13;
disasters. This has resulted in the percentage of the net portfolio represented&#13;
by net past dues plus restructured loans increasing overall from 5.7% in 1991 to&#13;
8.7% in 1992, 8.5% in 1993 and 10.5% in 1994. To cover its potential losses from&#13;
loans not repaid (as well as other potential losses), LBP has made substantially&#13;
increased provisions of P411 million in 1992, P814 million in 1993 and P872&#13;
million in 1994.  BSP reports have indicated that LBP's total provisions for&#13;
losses have generally been adequate, although this may reflect the pre-1992&#13;
situation, whereby potential losses on agrarian reform loans were mostly (at&#13;
least 85%) chargeable to ARF.&#13;
Loan Repayments&#13;
15.         Agrarian Sector Mortqages.   Repayments of ARMs which are passed&#13;
directly to ARF, have been poor, but have improved. They are now about 60% of&#13;
amounts currently due, up from 171 in 1986, and 37% in 1988, the first year&#13;
following the CARL.&#13;
16.         Loans to Small Farmers.  LBP had collection problems on loans to the&#13;
agrarian sector in the past. At the end of 1988, loans which were past due or&#13;
in litigation made up 50% of the gross outstanding loans of P479 million. This&#13;
unsatisfactory state of affairs appears to have resulted from LBP's previous role&#13;
as a conduit for Government programs. Most of the past dues prior to 1987 are&#13;
old and are unlikely to be cleared up.  However, under the new Countryside&#13;
Development Program initiated by LBP in 1987, the rate of repayment of loans, has&#13;
been much better.   Current collection rates to date under this program are&#13;
reported to have varied between 90% and 93% over the six years up to 1993, with&#13;
those of RBs being between 98% and 100%, while cooperatives, which over this&#13;
period had had a slight downward trend in performance were between 88% and 93%.&#13;
1994 figures are markedly different. Overall current collection fell to 77%.&#13;
The continued sound performance of RBs (99%) was offset by a significant&#13;
deterioration in collection - to only 68% - from cooperatives.&#13;

17.         Given the increase in the level of net non-performing loans plus&#13;
restructured loans, from 4.9% in 1990 to 37.3% in 1994, it is clear that the&#13;
level of provisioning has been inadequate. The calculations show that if it had&#13;
been LBP's intentions to make provisions at a level which would cover 70% of past&#13;
dues plus 30% of restructured loans, additional provisions of about P1.2 billion&#13;
would need to be made. Even at this level of provisioning, the percentage of net&#13;
past dues and restructured loans to total net loans for the agrarian sector would&#13;
have been 26.4% at the end of 1994 compared with 2.8% for the banking sector.&#13;
18.         An important element of LBP's corporate plan would be to collect&#13;
adequate data and come to terms with the issue of adequate provisioning for&#13;
agrarian loans. On the basis of historic 'current collection' data up to 1993&#13;
and anecdotal evidence on collection of past dues which suggests that about 35%&#13;
are collected in the first year after loans become past due, provisions ought to&#13;
have been made at a rate of about 7% on disbursements or 8-10% of the net&#13;
outstanding portfolio. In 1994, however, collection performance deteriorated&#13;
sharply, indicating higher provisioning may be necessary. On average, over the&#13;
past six years provisions of 8.32t on disbursements would have been required to&#13;
achieve provisioning equal to 70t of past dues plus 30% of restructurings.&#13;
19.         Banking Sector.   According to the loan portfolio analysis,  the&#13;
quantity and the quality of the Commercial Loans and Discounts Portfolio has&#13;
substantially increased and quality improved significantly since 1990.&#13;
Performing regular commercial loans (excluding "livelihood loans" handled by LBP&#13;
on behalf of government and ALF/CLF loans to PFIs) increased substantially from&#13;
P2.3 billion to P17.6 billion between December 1990 and December 1994, (a factor&#13;
of about 8 in nominal terms, or more than 5 in real terms).&#13;

20.         Between 1990 and 1994, past due commercial loans, restructured loans&#13;
and items in litigation have increased from P0.55 billion to P1.04 billion.  In&#13;
proportional terms, however, the gross percentage of restructured and non-&#13;
performing loans fell from 20% of the gross portfolio in 1990 to 5.0% in 1993,&#13;
and 5.6% in 1994. Lending to other banks and for trade bills, etc., has also&#13;
increased over the period. Interbank Loans, all of which are performing, have&#13;
increased from P532 million in 1990 to P1.4 billion in 1994 while net lending for&#13;
Other Bills, etc. has gone up from P642 million to P1.7 billion between 1990 and&#13;
1994. As a result of increased activity and improved collection, the percentage&#13;
of the Other Bills portfolio which is past due has fallen from a gross figure of&#13;
11% in 1990 to 2% in 1994.&#13;
21.         Overall, loan collection performance has improved impressively for&#13;
regular banking sector operations. Gross non performing loans which fell from&#13;
35% in 1988 to 15.4% in 1990 continued their decline to 4.9% in 1994. Net non&#13;
performing loans, which is a better measure of portfolio quality fell from 12.4%&#13;
in 1990 to 0.7% in 1993 but increased slightly to 0.9% in 1994. within the 1994&#13;
total, the figure for ALF/CLF loans which are essentially wholesale, is&#13;
satisfactorily low at less than 0.1%.&#13;

22.         Overall Situation.  LBP's Profit and Loss Account for the past five&#13;
years is shown as Appendix C and summarized in constant currency terms in table&#13;
5. Between 1990 and 1994 LBP's activities expanded substantially both in nominal&#13;
and in real terms.   By 1994 total gross earnings were P8.6 billion (US$319&#13;
million) and net income, in current terms, after contributing P777 million to&#13;
ARF, was R1.22 billion (US$45 million) . Nominal return to equity after tax has&#13;
averaged 18% over the five year period (14% excluding gains from property sales)&#13;
in nominal terms, and 5.1% in real terms.  These calculations are based on the&#13;
audited accounts, and therefore do not make any adjustment for underprovisioning&#13;
of agrarian loans. If account were taken of this (para 17), LBP would still have&#13;
earned a real net profit, on average, over the period reviewed of about 2%.&#13;

23.          Total real income  (of which typically more than 80% is interest&#13;
income) has increased by 129% over the past five years, while expenses have&#13;
increased by 211%, the most important item of these being the 342% increase in&#13;
interest payments. The main reason for the larger increase in interest payments&#13;
than in interest income, on a proportional basis, is that LBP has expanded very&#13;
rapidly, particularly between 1992 and 1993, without significantly increasing its&#13;
real equity capital.   Consequently a far greater proportion of LBP's  total&#13;
resources are now borrowed funds than was  the case in 1990.   The apparant&#13;
relatively large increase in total administrative and operating costs (168%)&#13;
compared with the increase in income (129%) results in part from the increase in&#13;
LBP's branching network, although the very high 1993 figure reflects the fact&#13;
that LBP had to cover a greater proportion of 'agrarian costs' in its own profit&#13;
and loss account than previously (or than in 1994).&#13;
24.          Agrarian Sector.   Table 6 below sets out the total net costs of&#13;
(subsidy for) supporting the agrarian sector. After taking account of actual&#13;
expenditure, cost of capital and estimated provisions needed and then netting&#13;
back interest received, the total cost of supporting this sector has increased&#13;
in nominal terms from P528 million in 1988 to P2,426 million in 1994. In real&#13;
terms, the cost increased rapidly from 1988-1990 - by 101%, then by 27% between&#13;
1991 and 1992, but has declined slightly since.&#13;

25.          The importance of ARF participations in the cost of agrarian lending,&#13;
the provision of technical assistance to the cooperatives, and the training of&#13;
their managements and members, are not immediately apparent from LBP's published&#13;
accounts. This is because ARF's participation towards administrative costs and&#13;
payments of bond interest have been netted out of LBP's profit and loss account,&#13;
as too has income collected for ARF from agrarian mortgages and, in some years,&#13;
agrarian loans. ARF's net participation in the cost of LBP's agrarian operations&#13;
is presented in Table 7 below.&#13;

a/   The P777 million shown in the P &amp; L account for 1994 is netted out of "Gross Admin Support".&#13;
26.         In addition to the explicit costs absorbed by ARF (D in the table),&#13;
ARF has also provided funds, free of interest, for onlending to Agrarian Reform&#13;
Beneficiaries (ARBs). Valuing these at the gross T-Bill rate (the opportunity&#13;
cost of acquiring such funds in the market), the effective participation provided&#13;
in this way (line F in the table) has increased from P69 million in 1988 (about&#13;
US$3 million) to P573 million in 1992 and P617 million in 1994 (about US$23&#13;
million). As a result of the increase number of ARBs, ARF's overall financing,&#13;
between 1988 and 1991, of LBP's agrarian operation increased substantially in&#13;
real terms (by 212%). In 1992, it increased slightly over 1991 (by 3%), but in&#13;
1993, it fell back sharply (by 28%), before increasing to its highest level ever&#13;
in 1994.  It should be noted, however, that LBP's costs associated with the&#13;
provision of technical assistance to cooperatives is estimated at about 25% of&#13;
total LBP's agrarian operating costs.   The effective nominal loss to LBP on&#13;
agrarian operations increased from P293 million in 1988 to R1.3 billion in 1993&#13;
(line J in the table) but fell to P850 million in 1994. The loss in real terms&#13;
(in 1994 constant peso) increased from P569 million in 1988 to P1.46 billion in&#13;
1993 (P569 million in 1988 to P1.46 billion in 1993 in 1994 constant peso terms).&#13;
Line I indicates the level of net support ARF can be considered to have provided,&#13;
after accounting for pure land reform operations.  In 1988, ARF did not even&#13;
fully cover Agrarian Reform Mortgages (ARMs) and Land Purchase costs, however,&#13;
by 1991 &amp; '92 it was effectively providing P400 million p.a. towards Agrarian&#13;
Reform Loans (ARLs) compared with LBP's effective contribution of about P800&#13;
million in those years. ARF's contribution to ARLs fell sharply in 1993 to only&#13;
P76 million, but in 1994 increased again to P525 million (Line J).&#13;
27.         At present interest rates, which for ARMs are fixed by the CARL, the&#13;
real net present (discounted) cost of land redistribution amounts to about&#13;
P22,900  (US$820) per hectare for the pure financial costs.   Including the&#13;
associated costs of surveying,  landowner support and mortgage amortization&#13;
collection,  the  present  per  ha  cost  would  be  about  P29,200,  or  over&#13;
US$1,000/ha'.&#13;
28.         It is clear from Table 8 that at the interest rates and spreads of&#13;
the past five years, provision of production loans to farmers is also a loss-&#13;
1/    The implication of this is that under the present arrangements, the faster&#13;
the rate of Agrarian Reform, the greater Land Bank's potential losses.&#13;

The cost of delivering agrarian loans (including costs associated with assisting&#13;
with cooperative development) has clearly declined as the volume has increased&#13;
and  LBP  has  moved  away  from  reLail  to  cooperative  lending.    However,  if  the&#13;
market interest rates (gross T-Bill rates) are added to these figures, break even&#13;
nominal interest rates collected on the adjusted volume of net loans outstanding&#13;
would have needed to have been as follows (Table 9) for agrarian lending to have&#13;
broken even.&#13;

of adjusted net portfolio.&#13;
29.            The bankinq  sector is a major element  in LBP's operation.   It now&#13;
accounts for about 80% of LBP's assets and 60% of LBP's outstanding loans.&#13;
Furthermore, it has contributed to covering the cost of the agrarian sector&#13;
through direct contributions to ARF and the provision of funds for agrarian&#13;
loans, mortgages and land purchase. Indeed, with the withdrawal of ARF support&#13;
to agrarian loans in 1993, the proportion of total agrarian costs supported by&#13;
LBP's banking sector was forced to increase sharply from 39% in 1992 to 57% in&#13;
1993 or an increase from p821 million to P1,335 million, but fell in 1994 to 35%,&#13;
P850 million.&#13;

30.         Within its banking sector, LBP undertakes two main types of activity&#13;
(i) normal commercial banking, including commercial loans, foreign exchange&#13;
dealing, etc.; and (ii) investments both in government instruments and in shares,&#13;
particularly privatization issues. Most of LBP's banking sector profits appear&#13;
to have come from investments. The salient points on the profitability of LBP's&#13;
banking sector as a whole are that (i) income as a percentage of total net loan&#13;
portfolio plus investments has been relatively modest, 17.4% in 1991, 13.7% in&#13;
1992, 13.9% in 1993 and 11.8% in 1994; (ii) interest expense has been low - 4.6%&#13;
of financial capital (loans + investments + cash) in 1991, 4.5% in 1992, 5.8% in&#13;
1993 and 5.3% in 1994; and (iii) administrative costs have fallen from 3% of&#13;
financial capital in 1991 to 2.2% in 1993 and 1.8t in 1994. The sound level of&#13;
profitability achieved results partly from LBP's overall low cost of money. This&#13;
is because (i) LBP has a substantial (but decreasing) proportion of its capital&#13;
in the form of equity, and (ii) average deposit interest paid as a percentage of&#13;
deposits is relatively low, averaging 7.2% in 1991, 5.2% in 1992, 6.4% in 1993&#13;
and 6.5% in 1994.  While each of these rates is below the wholesale cost of&#13;
borrowing, the differential has narrowed substantially.  Average spreads from&#13;
reinvesting deposits in T-Bills over the past four years are indicated as&#13;
follows:&#13;

LBP's favorable deposits mix, and hence low average cost of money is partly due&#13;
to its position as one of the three receivers of government agency funds. An&#13;
analysis of LBP's average deposit cost for savings and time deposits indicates&#13;
rates paid to Government were 1-21 below the national average 1990 - 1992 but the&#13;
differential appears to be narrowing, and was about 1% in 1993 and 1994.&#13;
31.         Subsidy Dependency Index (SDI).   One means of evaluating LBP's&#13;
overall operational performance is to review its subsidy dependency. To do this,&#13;
the SDI' for LBP is calculated using the methodology set out in World Bank&#13;
Discussion Paper No. 1742. Clearly, the level of this index depends upon LBP's&#13;
role - whether certain costs are considered as provisions of services to&#13;
Government, which therefore should be reimbursed by them, or whether they are&#13;
truly part of LBP's costs and need to be covered by interest rates or user fees.&#13;
32.               The most pragmatic approach is to consider the situation under&#13;
which LBP is likely to be working in future. That is LBP would be financially&#13;
responsible for loans to small farmers [agrarian reform loans (ARLs)] but its&#13;
1/    The definition of the Subsidy Dependency Index (SDI) is the percentage by&#13;
which the average annual interest rate would need to be raised in order to&#13;
fully eliminate the cost of both explicit and implicit subsidies.&#13;

operations in land purchase and agrarian reform mortgages (ARMs) would be as an&#13;
agent of Government/ARF who would provide the necessary funding and cover LBP's&#13;
operating costs. In this instance, to be conservative, LBP's technical support&#13;
for cooperative development is considered part of LBP's small farmer lending&#13;
operations, and so its own responsibility. Defined in this way, LBP's SDI over&#13;
the past seven years is estimated as follows.&#13;

33.         Under this scenario the SDI situation worsened between 1988 and 1991&#13;
(from 4.5% to 33.0%) as the volume of agrarian loans increased, but improved in&#13;
1993 and 1994 as the size of banking operations expanded relative to loans to&#13;
small farmers. The SDI in 1994 was 6.1%, indicating that LBP needed an effective&#13;
subsidy of roughly 6% of its gross interest earnings in order to break even. In&#13;
the past four years, on average, the effective subsidy LBP has had from 'free'&#13;
provision of equity, has more than covered its 'Adjusted Net Loss' . This&#13;
indicates that this 'support', together with the profits which LBP makes on its&#13;
'banking sector operations' has been sufficient to compensate for the net real&#13;
cost of agrarian lending.&#13;
Licruidity &amp; Solvency&#13;
34.                LBP' s liquid assets to deposit ratio has somewhat declined from&#13;
a high 1.4 in 1989 to 0.9 in December 1994, but remains satisfactory, and&#13;
substantially above the 0.5 average of the top 5 private Philippine banks.&#13;
Although LBP's equity as a share of total assets has dropped from a peak 31% in&#13;
1989 to 10.5% in 1993  (mainly due to the rapid expansion of deposits), LBP&#13;
remains adequately solvent and its risk assets to equity ratio of about 4.4 (4.8&#13;
if equity were adjusted downwards as a result of underprovisioning) compares&#13;
favorably to international standards and to average levels in the Philippines&#13;
(average of the top 5 private banks is 5.2) .  LBP also has the benefit of&#13;
substantial unrealized gains on property and shares in privatized companies.&#13;
These more than compensate for the possible overvaluation of agrarian loans&#13;
(resulting from underprovisioning).&#13;

SECOND RURAL FINANCE PROJECT&#13;
NATURE OF SUB-LOANS SUPPORTED UNDER THE COUNTRYSIDE LOAN FUND (CLF) 1992-94&#13;
1.        Evolution of CLF Lending.  By March 31, 1994, 687 sub-loans had been&#13;
supported under CLF.  CLF loans to PFIs totalled Peso 4.043 billion or about&#13;
US$155 million' at the weighted average exchange rate for the period of US$1 -&#13;
Peso 26. Total sub-loans made by PFIs amounted to Peso 4.889 billion (US$185&#13;
million) by the same date, and investments supported Pesos 7,006 billion (US$269&#13;
million) . Average projects were financed 30% by the sub-borrower, 12% by the PFI&#13;
and 58% by CLF.  Table A summarizes the development of the program over the&#13;
period. Despite relatively high real interest rates, averaging 5.8% from LBP to&#13;
PFIs and, with the addition of the average spread of 4.0%, almost 10t to sub-&#13;
borrowers, funds were drawn down rapidly. Clearly, because CLF's rates are set&#13;
three monthly, but the market is constantly readjusting, the CLF interest rate&#13;
is sometimes higher, and sometimes lower than the T-Bill rate. The volumes of&#13;
lending confirm the market's sensitivity to this. In the three quarters when the&#13;
CLF rate was above the T-Bill rate, volume averaged Peso 200 million at peso 5&#13;
million per loan while in the six periods when the CLF rate was below the T-Bill&#13;
rate, an average of Peso 573 million at Peso 6 million per loan were disbursed.&#13;

2.          Distribution of New and Expansion Sub-projects.  The available data&#13;
indicate that banks preferred to finance established projects with proven records&#13;
of profitability, although the proportion of new projects (19% by number, and 15%&#13;
by value) was greater than under ALF (13% by number, 5% by value) . Of the total&#13;
sub-loans, 556 were for the expansion of existing projects. The remainder went&#13;
to finance start up projects, many of which were in the service sector -&#13;
typically for transportation.&#13;
1/   This figure is higher than the US$150 loan amount, because there had&#13;
been some use of second generation funds prior to final loan drawdown.&#13;

3.           Size of Sub-Borrowers.  Of the 687 project loans, 568, or 83% were&#13;
for small-sized businesses projects with assets that totalled less than Peso 20.0&#13;
million  before  financing.    These  businesses  accounted  for  a  significant&#13;
proportion (22%) of CLF financing. Nevertheless, the bulk of the funds went to&#13;
larger scale businesses - 30% to 96 projects for businesses with assets between&#13;
Peso 20 and 200 million (US$ 0.8 - 7.6 million) and 48% to 23 firms with assets&#13;
of Peso 200 million and above (US$ 7.6 million and over).&#13;

4.           Sub-sector Distribution of Sub-loans.  CLF loans were extended to&#13;
a broad spectrum of rural based investments (Table D) : food and agro-processing&#13;
constituted the largest share (41%) of total CLF availments by amount;&#13;
agriculture and aquaculture represented 31%, manufacturing 15% and services, 13%.&#13;
The main types of investment in primary production were for livestock,&#13;
particularly poultry and pigs and sugar, among the processing loans, grain&#13;
millers and associated businesses were major borrowers, with beer, a.cohol and&#13;
sugar also important.   Manufacturing covered a wide range of products, from&#13;
aluminum foil to textiles and construction materials, while 80% of services&#13;
projects in were transportation.&#13;

5.           Sub-loans Distribution by Purpose.  With regard to the purposes for&#13;
which the CLF loans were utilized, 54% went to fixed assets, 28% went to working&#13;
capital, and 18* to a combination of working capital and acquisition of fixed&#13;
assets.   All in all, about two thirds of the total sub-loans were for fixed&#13;
assets and one third for working capital.&#13;

6.           Sub-loan Size and Spreads.  The average sub-loan size under the CLF&#13;
program was Peso 7.1 million (US$ 270,000), or more than three times larger than&#13;
the average loan under the previous ALF program, while the average spread was&#13;
4.06.  The rural banks had the smallest average loan size, rediscounting an&#13;
average of 483,000 Pesos (US$18,500) per loan with CLF. As would be expected,&#13;
they had the largest interest rate spread, averaging 8.0% on a volume weighted&#13;
basis.   Average rediscount figures per loan and spreads for other types of&#13;
institution were: commercial banks, Peso 15.1 million (US$580,000) at a spread&#13;
of 3.7%; thrift banks Peso 3.2 million (US$120,000), with a 4.4% spread,&#13;
Government banks Peso 5.2 million (US$200,000) with a 4.4% spread; and other&#13;
financial institutions, Peso 28 million (US$1.1 million) with a 3.0% spread.&#13;
Total sub-loan size was about 12% larger in each case (see Table G below).&#13;

Average Sub-loan Size: Peso 7.12 million&#13;
7.           Institutional  Participation.    As  of  March  1994,  97  financial&#13;
institutions were accredited for CLF funding as follow: commercial banks 25,&#13;
government banks 2, thrift banks 16, rural banks 49, and non-bank financial&#13;
institutions (NBFIs) 5. Of these, 20 commercial banks, 1 government bank, 12&#13;
thrifts, 16 rural banks and 2 NBFIs were making use of the program at that date.&#13;
Among the participating financial institutions, the commercial banks had the&#13;
highest total availment at 72%, followed by the thrift banks at 17%, government&#13;
banks at 4% and both NBFIs and rural banks at 3% each.   Compared with ALF, the&#13;
share of thrifts fell, but that of all other institutional types increased.&#13;

8.           Regional Distribution of Sub-projects.           Region IV  (Southern&#13;
Tagalog) was the area with both the greatest number of sub-loans (40%) and amount&#13;
disbursed (28%). This was followed by Region III (Central Luzon) - 20% of loans&#13;
and 13% of amount disbursed, Region VII (12% and 14%) and Region VI (8% and 18%).&#13;
Very little investment was made in Regions I (Ilocos), V (Bicol), VIII (Eastern&#13;
Visayas), XII (Central Mindinao) and Cordillera (in total, 9% of loans, and 5%&#13;
of amounts).&#13;
9.           Loan Maturities.  The payment of short-term sub-loans was normally&#13;
set at 12 months, except for sugar and banana production, which were granted a&#13;
six-month roll-over, for a total of 18 months. Medium- and long-term loans had&#13;
maturity periods up to 10 years, including a grace period on capital repayment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
Annex 2.2&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
The overall average maturity of CLF loans was about 4 years. Rural banks and&#13;
some thrift banks tended to make use of the maximum terms allowable for the&#13;
different sub-projects. The commercial banks were more conservative in extending&#13;
longer term credits.&#13;
10.          Impact on Sub-Borrowers.  Because the project is only two and a half&#13;
years old, there has been no ex post evaluation of sub-project profitability.&#13;
As a guide however, ex ante financial rates of return have been reviewed on a&#13;
sample of those loans for which FRR calculations were made.' The results were&#13;
as follows.&#13;

Clearly, investors had expectations of returns well above the cost of money to&#13;
them, which averaged about 10% in real terms.&#13;
11.         Economic Impact.  Economic analysis was only undertaken by banks for&#13;
projects to which sub-loans exceeded US$1 million. In these cases, the ERRs were&#13;
estimated by adjusting financial flows, using conversion factors provided to the&#13;
PFIs and LBP by NEDA. Reported ex-ante ERRs averaged 35% on the projects in the&#13;
sample reviewed (in total, loans to these projects amounted to about 45% of total&#13;
loans) . On average ERRs were estimated to be some five percentage points higher&#13;
than FRRs.   Analysis of the sample also indicated that the sub-loans were&#13;
projected to support total investment per job averaging Peso 2.5 million&#13;
(US$95,000) for rediscounting amounts of over Peso 50 million; Peso 850,000&#13;
(US$33,000) for rediscounting amounts Pesos 5-50 Million; and Peso 340,000&#13;
(US$13,000)  for rediscounting amounts below Pesos 5 million.   Overall,  an&#13;
estimated 9,000 new jobs were anticipated to result from CLF funded projects.&#13;
This number excludes both (i) the jobs created as part of the investment process,&#13;
e.g. in the construction industry; and (ii) indirect employment, e.g in&#13;
industries supplying project investments, such as feed milling in the case of&#13;
livestock investments.&#13;
1/    The sample comprised all sub-loans of over Peso 50 million, and 33% of&#13;
sub-loans Peso 5-50 million. For sub-loans below Peso 5 million, from&#13;
which a 10% sample was taken FRRs were not estimated during sub-loan&#13;
processing.&#13;

SECOND RURAL FINANCE PROJECT&#13;
CLF &amp; RLF Cash Flow Proiections&#13;
1.          CLF projections are detailed in Table 1, with supporting schedules&#13;
on subloan repayments given as Table 2. The basic assumption is for a US$ 120&#13;
million World Bank loan being drawn down from the beginning of 1995. Inflation&#13;
assumptions are for international inflation to be at 3% per year and peso&#13;
inflation to be at rates, indicated by NEDA, which fall from 10% in 1994 to 5%&#13;
in 1997. Exchange rates reflect purchasing power being maintained at the 1993&#13;
peso:dollar exchange rate of 27.5.&#13;
2.          The assumptions on the draw down of the World Bank CLF-2 loan,&#13;
subloan composition and inflation rates are detailed in the first section of&#13;
Table 1.  These indicate a five year draw down period for the loan.   Other&#13;
sources of funds flowing into LBP for relending under the CLF programme are (i)&#13;
the ALF-1 funds collected from CBP sub-borrowers, (ii) repayments existing of ALF&#13;
and CLF-1 subloans back to LBP from PFIs, (iii) final draw down of CLF-1, (iv)&#13;
LBP's cash contribution to new CLF supported loans 10% out of 75% i.e. 13.33% of&#13;
new loan amounts, (v) new LBP-CLF bonds or securitized debt instruments to tap&#13;
the domestic long term market, (vi) repayment of new loans, (vii) retained net&#13;
profit from CLF operations. Outflows from the LBP-controlled CLF comprise (i)&#13;
capital repayments to CBP of ALF-1 funds, (ii) capital repayments of the CLF-1&#13;
loan to World Bank', (iii) capital repayments of the CLF-2 loan to World Bank,&#13;
and (iv) new subloans made (interest received from subloans is assumed to be&#13;
equal to interest payable plus operating costs and so is netted out of the cash&#13;
flow).&#13;
3.          The  flow of funds within years shown in Table 1 is from the&#13;
standpoint of LBP.   Inflows from CBP are on the basis of the amortisation&#13;
schedule already submitted to LBP while the draw down of CLF-2 assumes US$40&#13;
million being drawn down in 1995, US$50 million in 1996, US$20 million in 1997&#13;
and US$7 and US$3 millions in the final two years of the project disbursement&#13;
period.   Repayments by PFIs of LBP subloans are based on the amortisation&#13;
schedules shown in Table 2. These are based on typical lending profiles under&#13;
CLF-1. The estimated LBP net profit contribution is based on the assumption that&#13;
LBP makes a net profit of 0.5% per annum on the cash balance and loan balance of&#13;
1/    Capital  repayments  of both the existing CLF loan  (3356-PH)  and the&#13;
proposed second World Bank CLF loan are assumed to be in 15 equal&#13;
installments starting in the sixth year after first drawdown. Because the&#13;
foreign exchange risk on the first loan would be borne by the Department&#13;
of Finance the repayment schedule is based on the nominal sum of pesos&#13;
borrowed.   The same approach is taken in the case of the proposed new&#13;
loan, i.e. it is assumed that the foreign exchange risk premiums which&#13;
would be collected as part of the interest charged are not retained in the&#13;
fund but are placed elsewhere and drawn on when loan repayment takes&#13;
place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the CLF fund. On this basis total inflows would be about P 2.7 billion in the&#13;
first year of the project (1985), increasing to over P 3 billion thereafter.&#13;
Assuming that LBP's policy is to retain about 159 of their CLF resources as cash,&#13;
the funds available for new subloans would increase from about R 1.6 billion in&#13;
1994 to P 2.5 billion in 1996 and thereafter grows in line with projected&#13;
inflation.   By 1997, financing of CLF from bonds etc. would be introduced to&#13;
allow this level of lending to be sustained in parallel with the repayment of the&#13;
CLF-1 loan.&#13;
4.           The third part of the Table 1 shows the position of CLF resources at&#13;
the year end. It includes the cash balance built up and held within LBP and the&#13;
outstanding balance of subloans made by LBP. These are financed by the ALF-1&#13;
loan from the Central Bank to LBP, the CLF-1 loan from the World Bank to LBP, the&#13;
new CLF-2 loan from World Bank to LBP, LBP's cash contributions which have built&#13;
up over time, LBP-CLF bonds outstanding and the build up of LBP's retained profit&#13;
from operating the fund.   In addition to LBP loans,  there is a declining&#13;
portfolio of old CBP loans which were made under the ALF and which continue to&#13;
be administered by LBP. In current terms the total portfolio of ALF/CLF loans&#13;
is estimated to build up from P 3.8 billion in December 1993 to P 9.2 billion in&#13;
December 1999 (to P 6.4 billion in constant end 1993 currency values) . Over the&#13;
period 1995 to 1999 an average of about P 2.0 billion new loans per year (in end&#13;
1993 currency values) would be made.&#13;
5.           Table 3 shows the 'without project" situation, that is the flow of&#13;
funds without any CLF-2. From this it can be seen that CLF lending would fall&#13;
from its estimated 1994 level of about P 1.6 billion to an average of about&#13;
P 0.6 billion per year in constant 1993 currency terms for the period 1995 to&#13;
1999.  It can be seen from this that over the five year period (1995 - 1999)&#13;
lending with the project would be approximately P 1.4 billion per year higher in&#13;
constant terms than without the proiect.&#13;
6.           Projections for lending from the parallel Retail Loan Fund (RLF) are&#13;
given in Table 4. Under this program, World Bank would provide funds for LBP&#13;
retail lending to rural sector borrowers. Cash inflows to the fund are the draw&#13;
down of the World Bank loan and LBP's cash contribution, which would be disbursed&#13;
to the fund at the rate of 20% of project cost, or a minimum of 23.5% of loans&#13;
made and repayments of the loans themselves. It is assumed that net profits from&#13;
the fund are withdrawn by LBP as they are made, so there is no fund build up from&#13;
retained profits.   Outflows comprise the loans made and, from the year 2000,&#13;
repayments to the World Bank.&#13;
7.           The lending under the LBP Retail Fund is projected at about P 250&#13;
million annually (in 1993 constant prices). The resultant portfolio of loans&#13;
built up under this program is consequently estimated to be about P 950 million&#13;
(P 820 million in 1993 prices) by the end of 1998. By that date, total assets&#13;
in the fund, including the 15% held as cash would be about P1.12 billion in&#13;
current terms, of which 75% would be funded by the World Bank loan and 25% by the&#13;
build up of LBP cash contributions.&#13;

PHILIPPINES&#13;
Second Rural Finance Proiect&#13;
Environmental Technical Services&#13;
1.   The objectives of the environmental technical services are to: (i) ensure&#13;
that projects financed through the Second Rural Finance Project (SRFP) are&#13;
environmentally sound; (ii) assure compliance of projects with Government's&#13;
environmental laws and regulations; and (iii) accelerate the processing of&#13;
official environmental clearances and permits. The environmental protection&#13;
process under the propsoed project would be governed by the existing GOP&#13;
procedures and mandatory regulations.&#13;
Environmental Unit (EU)&#13;
2.   Environmental technical services would be provided by an EU that has been&#13;
established within LBP [under the Program Lending Department (PLD)J . The scope&#13;
of its activities are detailed in Appendix A. The EU would provide services to&#13;
the PLD and Account Management Group (AMG) departments (for the CLF II and RCF&#13;
credit programs), and any other units within LBP, as well as any future World&#13;
Bank environmental projects for which the LBP might act as the main financial&#13;
intermediary.    The  EU would be  staffed by a  core  of professionals  and&#13;
administrative assistants, and would be supported by qualified consultants which&#13;
would be providing periodic short term services. To assure quality and conformity&#13;
of consulting services, a pool of preselected consulting firms would be&#13;
established, out of which consulting services would be provided on a competitive&#13;
basis. Recommended criteria for consultants selection are detailed in Appendix&#13;
B. The services that may be requested from the consultants are specified in&#13;
Appendix A.&#13;
3.   LBP, with the support of the Bank, selected (May 1994) six consulting firms&#13;
which were found to be qualified for further participation in a final&#13;
qualification bid that would be issued by LBP within the third quarter of CY&#13;
1994. Additional candidates for participation in the qualification bid may be&#13;
introduced by LBP. The list of accredited consultancy firms along with their&#13;
qualification documents would be submitted for Bank review on annual basis.&#13;
4.   Sub-borrowers under the project may choose to seek the assistance of LBP&#13;
in the preparation of Project Description (PD) or the Environmental Impact&#13;
Statement (EIS) . The cost associated with this assistance would be borne by the&#13;
sub-borrowers.   LBP would bear the cost of all other services detailed in&#13;
Appendix A.&#13;
5.   Technical Support to EMB would be provided by the EU when required.  EMB&#13;
officials haVE confirmed their acceptance and welcomed the initiative taken by&#13;
LBP.    The  technical  support  would mainly  include  environmental  scoping,&#13;
preparation  of  conditionalities   attached  to  environmental   clearances,&#13;
construction permits or operating permits. Conditionalities imposed by EMB or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 2 of 8&#13;
DENR may include emission limits, mitigation measures, environmental management&#13;
plans, and monitoring plans,consistent with GOP regulations.&#13;
Internal LBP Environmental Procedures&#13;
6.   The procedures for processing SRFP sub-loans would be similar to those used&#13;
under the first CLF.  The procedures incorporate monitoring  the progress of&#13;
approval stages of environmental clearances and permits. Supportive action or&#13;
contractual punitive measures would be applied if the sub-borrower fails to&#13;
fulfill its obligations. The procedures are summarized in the schematic diagram&#13;
attached as Appendix C.&#13;
7.   Terms of reference for the preparation of EIS and PD concerning sub-projects&#13;
to be financed under the SRFP would comply with the "Annotated EIS Outline" in&#13;
the latest amendment to Presidential Decree 1586 known as the Philippine&#13;
Environmental Impact Statement System.&#13;
Training&#13;
8.   A training program for loan and executive officers would be implemented by&#13;
LBP as part of the institutional strengthening program.   This would be a&#13;
continuous program aimed at basic initial training followed by annual or semi&#13;
annual updating and recap. Trainees would be assigned from PLD, AMG loan centers,&#13;
the branch  supervision  unit,  other  related head office  units  and  PFIs.&#13;
Altogether, more than 150 participants are expected, out of which about 100 would&#13;
be nominated by the PFIs. A training program for 1995, prepared by the training&#13;
department of the LBP, would be submitted for Bank review by October 31, 1994,&#13;
and thereafter the updated one for each fiscal year by November 30 of each year.&#13;
9.   A thematic outline of the training program,  based on the mission's&#13;
recommendations, was prepared by LBP and is attached as Appendix D. The duration&#13;
of the training program was estimated as follows: (i) one week for the basic&#13;
training; and (ii) two days every year for updating and recap. Subdivision of&#13;
each of the above components may be considered to avoid disruption of routine&#13;
work. The estimated cost of this environmental training program, including the&#13;
related technical assistance is US$215,000.&#13;

OUTLINE FOR LAND BANK ENVIRONMENTAL TRAINING PROGRAM&#13;
The aims of the proposed training program would be to:&#13;
a)   Familiarize both LBP and the PFIs with the organizational structure&#13;
of DENR/EMB and other government offices responsible for&#13;
environmental affairs (e.g. LGUs, HLURB, LLDA), NGOs, environmental&#13;
affiliations of various economic sectors in the country and&#13;
international organizations and related environmental activities.&#13;
b)   Provide regular communication and dialogue with DENR/EMB regarding&#13;
the processing of environmental clearances and permits in the&#13;
Philippines.&#13;
c)   Familiarize both LBP and PFIs on the basic steps of environmental&#13;
scoping and impact assessment systems.&#13;
d)   Stress the importance of basic natural resources and its impact on&#13;
the quality of life and the economic prosperity of the Philippines.&#13;
e)   Help ensure compliance with environmental laws and regulations,&#13;
basic emissions and effluent standards; as well as air and water&#13;
quality standards.&#13;

Maintenance of Sound Financial Condition&#13;
1.          LBP would maintain a solid financial condition over the next few&#13;
years, including: (i) a capital base solid enough to support risk-taking related&#13;
to an increasing portfolio for the benefit of the Philippines' rural sector; (ii)&#13;
ample profitability to avoid an erosion of the institution's equity base and&#13;
allow the generation of real profits, needed to enlarge the real equity base over&#13;
time; and (iii) sufficient liquidity to guarantee timely payments of all&#13;
obligations and ensure a high reputation and confidence in the institution by the&#13;
creditors, the public and the government.&#13;
2.          Solvency.  LBP aims to maintain a satisfactory Risk Assets to Equity&#13;
Ratio, well below the limits imposed by the new Banking Law issued in 1992. In&#13;
fact, given the nature of the unpredictable risks that affect the Philippines'&#13;
agricultural sector--especially those related to small farmers' rice and corn&#13;
production--LBP needs to maintain a higher-than-normal level of equity vis-a-vis&#13;
its total risk assets (e.g., more than 1:8 instead of 1:12 as required by law).&#13;
Over the next five years, however, LBP needs to enhance its efforts to maintain&#13;
an adecuate equity base by strengthening its agrarian lending policies and&#13;
procedures. Arrangements would also, be made with Government that payment of&#13;
dividends by LBP would not reduce the real value of its equity and, when profits&#13;
allowed, would permit earnings, equal to at least one seventh of the growth in&#13;
LBP's net agrarian loan portfolio, to be retained.LBP will make every effort&#13;
possible to maintain an adequate liquidity on the operations for which it is&#13;
directly responsible.&#13;
3.          Profitability in Real Terms.  To ensure increasing levels of real&#13;
equity over time, it is of utmost importance that LBP generate profits in real&#13;
terms. Once LBP has expanded its lending to conform with its planned risk assets&#13;
ratio, the level of profits in real terms should tend to match the expected real&#13;
growth rate of LBP's lending operations in the five-year period (e.g., 3%-5%&#13;
p.a.) . Monitoring this profit target will require that LBP's annual profits be&#13;
measured after discounting the erosion of equity due to inflation.   To meet&#13;
profit targets, LBP will establish secondary targets on the main variables that&#13;
affect its profitability, namely: (i) the mix between commercial and agrarian&#13;
lending; (ii) the lending margins on commercial and agrarian lending; (iii) the&#13;
quality of the agrarian portfolio and the related provisions that need to be&#13;
taken to bring total provisions on the existing portfolio to adequate levels and&#13;
additional provisions that will need to be taken in the future on an annual&#13;
I/    This strengthening program was prepared by LBP staff with the assistance&#13;
of the Bank's appraisal team.&#13;

basis, depending on actual collection rates; (iv) the overall operating cost&#13;
levels, which depend on the relative efficiency of the bank in carrying out the&#13;
various types of operations; and (v) the efficiency of the financial&#13;
intermediaries that LBP uses to channel its lending operations, especially the&#13;
cooperatives that attend the financial needs of the rural community.&#13;
4.          Licuiditv.   The maintenance of sufficient liquidity to guarantee&#13;
timely payments of all obligations to all creditors and ensure a high reputation&#13;
of LBP will depend greatly on efforts by the National Government to meet its&#13;
financial obligations on agrarian reform operations, especially those related to&#13;
the purchase of reformed land.   Arrangements would be made between LBP and&#13;
Government to safeguard LBP through the issuance of National Government Bonds&#13;
instead of LBP Bonds to compensate landowners for newly purchased land under&#13;
CARP.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening&#13;
5.          In addition to financial goals, there are LBP's institutional issues&#13;
per se that require urgent attention. The main institutional aspects that have&#13;
been identified by LBP and require priority attention are:&#13;
(a)   capital market development and resource mobilization efforts;&#13;
(b)   strengthening the cooperative intermediaries;&#13;
(c)   accreditation of cooperatives; and&#13;
(d)   loan provisioning and enhancing agrarian collection statistics&#13;
Capital Markets Development and Resource Mobilization Instruments&#13;
6.          With regard to capital markets development, LBP will design possible&#13;
programs to provide underwriting support to PFIs and non-financial private&#13;
corporations, so as to allow them to issue medium- and long-term Peso bonds in&#13;
the local market. LBP will explore ways to possibly issued bonds provided they&#13;
carry satisfactory interest rates, linked to the six-month T-Bill. LBP would&#13;
charge a competitive underwriting fee (e.g., a one time 3% fee) for these&#13;
operations. LBP would, then, offer these bonds for sale in the local market.&#13;
To make the bonds more attractive, LBP could offer options to buyers of the bonds&#13;
to sell them back to LBP before maturity, for a market determined fee. Also, LBP&#13;
is preparing to undertake a Global Medium Term Note Program (GMTN) in the Euro&#13;
and Asian market with a first tranche in 1996.&#13;
7.          LBP would develop new resource mobilization instruments to increase&#13;
its share of private sector deposits. The new resource mobilization instruments&#13;
will include medium-term bonds at competitive interest rates.  LBP will also&#13;
explore the possibility of selling agricultural loans to commercial banks. They&#13;
would be interested in purchasing these loans from LBP, provided that such loans&#13;
be counted as valid for meeting agri/agra requirements. This move would allow&#13;
LBP to increase its capability to make new loans to the rural sector under the&#13;
CLF rules and, possibly, even to increase its margin.&#13;

StrenQtheninq of Cooperative Intermediaries&#13;
8.          LBP intends to strengthen its accredited cooperatives through a&#13;
Cooperative Technical Assistance Program (CTAP).   The total number of LBP's&#13;
accredited cooperatives exceeded 7,000 as of December 31, 1993, attending over&#13;
700,000 of small farmers. While it is clear that the quality of LBP's agrarian&#13;
portfolio heavily depends on the quality of the accredited cooperatives, LBP&#13;
still does not have an adequate monitoring system to check on their quality and&#13;
efficiency. During 1994, LBP aims at developing an efficient Cooperative Data&#13;
Base and Monitoring System, with the following main features:&#13;
(a)   a computerized data base that will gather a comprehensive&#13;
information to be received from the field offices (FOs) on&#13;
each cooperative;&#13;
(b)   the information in the data base would be updated, at least&#13;
semi-annually, by the respective FO through a comprehensive&#13;
review of LBP's portfolio with the coops and through visits to&#13;
be carried out by the FO staff to the managers and selected&#13;
members of the coops; and&#13;
(c)   semi-annual reports that summarize and analyze the data and&#13;
offer corrective action, if needed, on: (1) training; (2)&#13;
legal action to be taken to recover loans; (3) loan&#13;
rescheduling; (4) proposed new lending targets and strategy;&#13;
(5) resource mobilization; and (6) other corrective action.&#13;
9.          LBP intends to appoint staff or to hire consultants for developing&#13;
the data-base system during the second half of 1994. The responsible team will&#13;
initiate gathering the data through the FOs, computerized and analyze it. It is,&#13;
therefore, expected that the first comprehensive report on the coops would be&#13;
ready by the end of 1995.   Upon the results of this first coop report, the&#13;
tentative cooperative CTAP will be revised both in its contents and scope. About&#13;
one month after the recommendations of this first comprehensive report had been&#13;
approved by LBP's management, the implementation of the revised CTAP will be&#13;
started.&#13;
Accreditation of Cooperatives&#13;
10.          In addition  to  the need of  strengthening  existing  accredited&#13;
cooperatives the accreditation criteria for new cooperatives would be revised.&#13;
This is a key factor that has an important impact on LBP's future operations and&#13;
financial condition, especially if it is recognized that once LBP starts working&#13;
with a coop--because of social reasons--it is not easy for LBP to phase out the&#13;
weak cooperatives in the short term, even if conditions warrant it. Thus, new&#13;
accreditation criteria would be made more stringent and renewal accreditation&#13;
criteria on existing coops would be gradually brought in line.&#13;
11.         The new main accreditation criteria (institutional and financial) on&#13;
cooperative eligibility would include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
Annex 4.2&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
(a)   requirement that the coop's management group be qualified and&#13;
be satisfactory to LBP. It would include, at least, a strong&#13;
leader (who may act also as general/financial manager) , a&#13;
bookkeeper, an accountant, an auditor, and an experienced loan&#13;
officer.   The final purpose of the management team is to&#13;
ensure that the coop would maintain a satisfactory&#13;
institutional condition; '&#13;
(b)   lending and collection policies satisfactory to LBP;&#13;
(c)   accounting,   auditing,   and   internal   control   systems&#13;
satisfactory to LBP;&#13;
(d)   a total assets to equity ratio not to exceed 12:1;&#13;
(e)   a total of cooperative liabilities with non-members, including&#13;
LBP, no to exceed 5-6 times the total equity plus member&#13;
deposits;&#13;
(f)   the operating costs of the cooperative, including management&#13;
salaries and lending operating costs, should be covered by the&#13;
expected spread on the cooperative loans plus any other&#13;
earnings of the cooperatives; and&#13;
(g)   requirement that the cooperative be current with all its&#13;
creditors, including LBP.  Forecasts for the following year&#13;
should also demonstrate that the cooperative will continue to&#13;
be current with all its creditors.&#13;
1/ Satisfactory institutional and managerial arrangements would also include:&#13;
(a) ensuring discipline among coop members;&#13;
(b) adequate internal policies and procedures on acceptance of new members, so&#13;
as to ensure the financial viability of the cooperative over the long-&#13;
term;&#13;
(c) mix of cooperative operations to ensure its financial viability, such as&#13;
input purchasing, production, warehousing, marketing, and credit union&#13;
activities;&#13;
(d) resource mobilization development, including mechanisms to induce greater&#13;
savings in the coop by members and non-members;&#13;
(e) optimal number of members of a cooperative to ensure financial viability&#13;
within the managerial capabilities of the coop;&#13;
(f) training of coop's management and members, including coop supervision by&#13;
the members; and&#13;
(g) policies on lending, including member contribution requirements, loan&#13;
collection, rescheduling, arrears management and collection, fiduciary&#13;
joint liability groups.&#13;

Annex 4.2&#13;

Loan Provisioning and Enhancing Agrarian Loan Collection Statistics&#13;
12.         LBP would establish an agrarian loans Provisioning policy which is&#13;
based on its actual, rather than hoped for, level of total loan collections. To&#13;
do this, an improved set of loan classification criteria specific to cooperative&#13;
agrarian lending would be established and appropriate provisioning ratios would&#13;
be assigned to each category. The timeliness of provisioning for agrarian loans&#13;
also would be reviewed. Initially, and to assure timely provisioning, LBP would&#13;
book loss provisions on an automatic basis, as a percentage of disbursements,&#13;
with the percentage varying by type of loan, region, and classification of&#13;
cooperative, depending upon past experience.   LBP would provide for 50% of&#13;
incremental past due and 25% of incremental restructured loans. Provisioning at&#13;
the rate of 8.3% of all loans disbursed would, on average, maintain the&#13;
provisioning in the balance sheet at this level.&#13;
13.         LBP would enhance its collection statistics, mainly on agrarian&#13;
lending activities. Statistics on agrarian loans would include information on&#13;
the amounts collected on a monthly basis and the amounts rescheduled, including&#13;
the reasons for the rescheduling and number of times of rescheduling, specifying&#13;
whether unpaid interest has been added to rescheduled balances. In addition,&#13;
statistics would include the actual monthly collection of rescheduled amounts.&#13;
It is, therefore, intended to carry out the development of a new system as a part&#13;
of the Coop Database and Monitoring System.&#13;
14.         The collection data base would enable establishment of the total&#13;
collection of past due accounts in any year by identifying the timely collections&#13;
and the proportions of collections of past due accounts in every year.   For&#13;
example, if for loans made in year x, timely collections were 90%, collection in&#13;
year x+l of the past dues were an additional 3%, and collections in year x+2 of&#13;
the past dues were an additional 2%, and there were no more collection thereon,&#13;
then the total collection rate of loans made in year x would be 95%. In that&#13;
case, a provision of 5% to cover probable losses would normally be required for&#13;
this type of loans.&#13;
FINANCIAL PLAN: TARGETS AND PROJECTIONS&#13;
A. Tarqets&#13;
Agrarian Reform Mortgage Lending&#13;
15.         The pace of development would be determined by DAR, beyond LBP's&#13;
control. Nevertheless, LBP would continue to acquire land, issue bonds and make&#13;
mortgage loans, as long as ARF funding payments are timely.   This would be&#13;
switched from LBP's balance sheet to a trust operation by 31 December 1995.&#13;
Lending to Small Farmers through Coops and RFIs&#13;
16.         LBP would improve the quality and reduce the cost of its agrarian&#13;
lending operations, while expanding as fast as is prudent. Overall, the rate of&#13;
expansion of new loans is initially targeted at about 5% p.a. in real terms, with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
Annex 4.2&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
a likely loss rate on new loan disbursements not exceeding 5%.   Net new&#13;
provisions in any year would at least be equal to the net increase in past dues,&#13;
plus 25% of the net increases in restructured loans.&#13;
Commercial Lending&#13;
17.         The profits on commercial banking would be required  to cross&#13;
subsidize lending to small farmers, so as to maintain real equity. There is,&#13;
therefore, a strong need to expand sound and profitable lending as fast as&#13;
funding allows --aiming to match maturities lent to maturities of funding&#13;
sources. The target growth rate. subiect to availability of resources is 20t&#13;
p.a. in real terms on regular lending activities. Lending under CLF would be&#13;
accelerated so as to draw down 90% of new funds within 3 years and to maintain&#13;
the total CLF pool of funds at least at a level of 85% lent. Also, LBP will&#13;
continue as a full service bank, aiming to increase real income from its foreign&#13;
exchange, trust and other service departments. These are targeted to grow in&#13;
real terms at 5% p.a..&#13;
Investments&#13;
18.         LBP's policy should be to limit investments mainly to Government&#13;
instruments as required (presently 50% of Government deposits should be invested&#13;
in Government securities) . However, if the level of Government deposits are too&#13;
high, the level of investments would exceed the 50% investment requirement, not&#13;
to increase excessively LBP's lending risks.&#13;
Deposits&#13;
19.         LBP will work to expand deposits, particularly private deposits. The&#13;
target should be to increase private sector deposits from the level of P9.3 (at&#13;
the end of 1994) billion, so that they cover a significantly larger proportion&#13;
of private loans.  Over the next two years, they are targeted to increase to&#13;
about P21 billion, and 20% p.a. in 1998 and 1999.   Growth in public sector&#13;
deposits would be profitable for LBP, but the rate of growth is largely outside&#13;
LBP's control. LBP's financial projections assume that public sector deposits&#13;
will remain constant in real terms.&#13;
Administrative Costs&#13;
20.         Real unit operating costs for LBP need to be reduced over the next&#13;
five years.  For agrarian lending, an improvement to 6% of the net outstanding&#13;
portfolio is targeted by 1996. In the commercial banking sector, an improvement&#13;
in these would be achieved by restricting overall annual increases in real&#13;
administrative costs to 2% p.a. after 1994, while overall activities grow at more&#13;
than double this rate.&#13;

Annex 4.2&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
B. Financial Prolections (1994-98)&#13;
21.         The assumptions for financial projections incorporate the targets&#13;
discussed above.   The starting point is the December 31 1994 balance sheet.&#13;
Inflation assumptions are based on NEDA targets (6.5* for 1995), and interest&#13;
rates are geared to inflation changes.   Correction of underprovisioning of&#13;
agrarian loans is assumed to be undertaken over three years, during which time&#13;
matching one time gains on property and stocks would be realized.&#13;
22.         The projected balance sheets and profit and loss accounts (Annex 5.1)&#13;
indicate that LBP should remain in a sound financial position over the next five&#13;
years, provided ARF is able to meet its substantial liabilities which amount to&#13;
about P 40 billion over the period.  During this period, total assets would&#13;
increase in real terms by about 9.3% per year, and equity by only about 2.81 p.a.&#13;
in real terms - indicating that a real tax rate in the form of 50% dividend may&#13;
be unreasonably high.   Correspondingly the risk assets ratio excluding land&#13;
reform would deteriorate from about 4.9:1 at the end of 1994 to 5.5:1 at the end&#13;
of 1996.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY&#13;
23.         To  ensure  successful   implementation  of  this  Institutional&#13;
Strengthening Action Plan (ISAP), LBP's management will:&#13;
(a)   seek the ISAP's approval by LBP's Board;&#13;
(b)   require that the responsibility of implementing the ISAP be&#13;
the duty of LBP's respective line managers.   However,  the&#13;
overall responsibility of implementing the plan will remain&#13;
with LBP's President;&#13;
(c)   appoint a Task Force  (TF)  to be in charge of monitoring&#13;
progress under the various components on a regular basis.&#13;
Furthermore, the TF will submit semi-annual reports for the&#13;
consideration of the President and annual reports for the&#13;
Board, including recommendations on remedial actions, if&#13;
needed;&#13;
(d)   seek the financial and institutional support of bilateral&#13;
donors and multi-lateral banks.&#13;
24.         In addition to the semi-annual review process, the TF will seek LBP's&#13;
management attention to specific issues at any time, if warranted. The TF's Head&#13;
will be responsible for the efficiency of ISAP's monitoring.  He/she will be&#13;
allowed to delegate the monitoring of specific aspects to other TF members.&#13;
25.         The TA and the training program would give priority consideration in&#13;
providing support to areas recommended by the ISAP's TF.&#13;

SECOND RURAL FINANCE PROJECT&#13;
Prolect Training and Technical Assistance Program&#13;
1.          Two main training programs would be carried out by LBP under the&#13;
project as follows: (a) for CLF and RCF related staff in LBP and the PFIs; and&#13;
(b) for cooperative staff and management.&#13;
Training of CLF/RCF Staff&#13;
2.          LBP would review the broad range of tasks to be performed under the&#13;
project by its CLF and RCF Units and PFI's staff at different levels; the skills&#13;
already available within the institutions; and the skill gaps to be addressed by&#13;
the training program. The findings of this review would be used to design the&#13;
course modules, identify the clientele to be trained, and determine the frequency&#13;
of the courses. Based on a preliminary assessment, the following represents a&#13;
broad outline of the program.&#13;
3.          TrainincT Obiectives would be to remedy the skill gaps of officers and&#13;
staff (senior, middle an operating) associated with CLF/RCF lending in LBP and&#13;
participating Banks.&#13;
(a)   Potential trainers would be pooled and trained to assume the&#13;
lead role in teacher's training. For this priority activity,&#13;
LBP would draw on the combined resources of its staff, and the&#13;
faculties of other agencies with training capabilities.&#13;
(b)   Senior level officials in CLF and RFC would be oriented on&#13;
policy and decision-making requirements for lending under&#13;
these programs.&#13;
(c)   Skills of CLF/RCF staff would be upgraded in procedures for&#13;
sub-project processing, accounting, monitoring and reporting&#13;
of CLF/RCF transactions.&#13;
(d)   All levels of participating bank staff would be rained under&#13;
the same program as CLF staff, with emphasis on medium - and&#13;
long-term project appraisal, environmental matters, and&#13;
inflation implications on sub-borrower cash-flow and sub-loan&#13;
repayment.&#13;
(e)   The skills of staff in LBP's CLF Unit in charge of PFIs&#13;
accreditation analysis would be upgraded in institutional&#13;
appraisal, with special emphasis on rural banks.&#13;
4.          Selection  of  Participants  of  CLF/RCF  TraininQ.    A  standard&#13;
requirement would be that participants would be those staff who most need the&#13;
skills, by virtue of being involved in CLF/RCF lending.   Participants in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
Annex 4.3&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
trainers training course would be in a position to continue with the program&#13;
until staff requirements are met.&#13;
S.          Skills and training Needed.   Courses would be designed following&#13;
completion of the review process, but are generally expected to be as follows:&#13;
(a)   Senior  level  officers  would  be  given  a  familiarization&#13;
briefing on the decision-making and policy formulation&#13;
requirements for CLF/RCF.&#13;
(b)   Middle-level officers would receive additional training in&#13;
loan appraisal, environmental matters, monitoring, accounting,&#13;
and loan documentation for short-term, and medium-and long-&#13;
term credit.&#13;
(c)   Operations  staff  would  be  trained  in  loan  processing,&#13;
collateral valuation and custody, record keeping, bookkeeping&#13;
and reporting;&#13;
(d)   Loan team members would receive additional training in loan&#13;
and project appraisal and supervision with special attention&#13;
to inflation implications concerning sub-borrower's cash-flow,&#13;
value of collateral, profit and loss accounts, sub-loan&#13;
repayment, environmental implications.&#13;
(e)   LBP staff responsible for PFIs accreditation would be trained&#13;
in conducting institutional appraisals.&#13;
6.          Senior officers of CLF/RCF unit and the part.cipating banks would be&#13;
provided with information mainly through lecture-discussions and open forums.&#13;
For middle-level officers, training would emphasize case studies and situations,&#13;
loan appraisal, lending decisions, portfolio management and control reports. For&#13;
operating staff, training and would consist of lectures and simulation of loan&#13;
application processing and collateral evaluation.   For loan team members and&#13;
credit supervisors, and combination of lecture, discussion, and case studies&#13;
would be undertaken.&#13;
7.          Evaluation of Training Activities.  The training program would be&#13;
evaluated at two different stages. The first stage would involve an assessment&#13;
of knowledge, skills and attitudes acquired from the training. The second stage&#13;
would consider the impact of training of job behavior and institutional&#13;
functioning.   The latter would be spread over a longer period than for the first&#13;
stage, since the former is immediately observable while the later would require&#13;
a longer term.&#13;
Cooperative Traininq&#13;
B.          Training Obiectives.  The main objectives of this training program&#13;
would be to upgrade the capability of participating cooperatives to perform a&#13;
financial intermediary functions in providing credit to members and mobilizing&#13;
savings.   More specifically, the program would deepen members' knowledge and&#13;
understanding of the cooperative as an economic enterprise dealing with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
Annex 4.3&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
marketing, processing, inputs supply, credit provision and/or resource&#13;
mobilization.&#13;
9.          Training would be directed at members and management.&#13;
(a)   Potential trainers would be pooled and trained.   LBP would&#13;
draw on various resources such as universities and other&#13;
government agencies with training capabilities.&#13;
(b)   Farmers would be oriented in the value and advantage of&#13;
collective actions to solve common technical issues, basic&#13;
cooperative structure and members' responsibilities.&#13;
(c)   On-the-job training and practice would be offered in basis&#13;
business activities, mainly bookkeeping, accounting, marketing&#13;
and management.&#13;
(d)   Loans administration procedures would be introduced, such as&#13;
loan appraisal and processing, credit risk evaluation, credit&#13;
worthiness analysis (links between production credit and&#13;
cooperative marketing and between credit and member savings),&#13;
interest calculation, collection procedures, supervision, past&#13;
due loans and remedy procedures, legal aspects and forms, and&#13;
internal control system.&#13;
10.         Selection of Participants.  This training program would be offered&#13;
to about 2,000 LBS's assisted cooperatives.   This is a selected group of&#13;
cooperatives that can be upgraded, through adequate training and institutional&#13;
building measures, to perform financial intermediary functions in providing&#13;
credit to their members and mobilizing savings.&#13;
11.         Categories and Kind of Training to be Offered.   Courses would be&#13;
design to respond to identified skill needs and are generally expected to be as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)   management  staff  would  be  given  course  in:    general&#13;
management,   planning  and  budgeting,   outside   resource&#13;
mobilization and funds management, rediscounting, savings&#13;
mobilization, accounting, auditing and internal control.&#13;
(b)   credit officers would receive training in loan appraisal and&#13;

            Philippines - Second Rural Finance Project

        <abstracts>
            Building on the achievements of the
            first rural finance Project the Second rural finance Project
            will help to expand the volume of medium and long term
            commercial credit to agriculture and rural development in
            the Philippines and to enhance the policy framework of the
            rural financial sector by: 1) supporting the development of
            the Land bank of the Philippines (LBP) two funds -- the
            Countryside Loan Fund (CLF) and the Retail Cofinancing Fund
            (RCF) to finance private sector investment in the rural
            areas; 2) strengthening LBP as the main wholesale financial
            institution serving the rural areas; and 3) upgrading the
            operational capacity of rural cooperatives, participating
            financial institutions, particularly thrift banks and rural
            banks, to provide financial services in the rural areas. The
            project comprises two major components. The first is a
            credit component for medium and long term loans to finance
            private investments in agricultural and other viable rural
            operations for a broad spectrum of agricultural and non-farm
            rural investment, processing, marketing, transport services,
            storage facilities, custom service of leasing operations and
            import of ciritical inputs. The second is an institutional
            strengthening program which will strengthen LBP financially
            and organizationally to ensure its sustainability in
            providing financial services to the rural population.
