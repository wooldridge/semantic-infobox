Utilities in Africa focused on two particular           operations (for example, ONEA, SDE, or&#13;
challenges: mobilization of additional funding for      SONES). This, in turn, promotes freedom from&#13;
development of the water sector; and ensuring           political interference and autonomy in recruitment&#13;

Water utilities that rely entirely on public funding           prior utility reform and market transaction; b)&#13;

2. Market Finance and Utility&#13;
Reform can be Interlinked&#13;
&#13;
Historically, African water utilities have relied          is risky. This achievement would be underpinned&#13;
on government and donor funding to finance                 by external (policy and regulatory) and internal&#13;
business operations and to bridge financing                (management and governance) factors, which, in&#13;
gaps. However, in recent years, many utilities             turn, depend on the progress of utility reforms.&#13;
have expressed interest and even begun&#13;
to demonstrate potential to access market                  Workshop deliberations suggest that such&#13;
(commercial) finance. For a water utility,                 external factors as operational autonomy and the&#13;
market finance offers a number of potential                nature of government support have a significant&#13;
benefits, among these: the rigorous demands of             influence on utility creditworthiness and, hence,&#13;
markets which emphasize strong management,                 access to markets. For example, a utility's ability&#13;
accountability, and transparency. Generally,               to set and revise tariffs, implement disconnection&#13;
tapping financial markets is a more open and               procedures in response to nonpayment, and&#13;
transparent process than sourcing government or            collect tariffs from government agencies (which&#13;
donor grants. In countries where the water sector          often comprise the bulk of billings and arrears)&#13;
has reached or is close to reaching maximum                are critical for strong revenue management. Yet,&#13;
expenditure ceilings set by finance ministries,            these courses of action are all too often subject&#13;
market finance also helps to increase total                to government policy and influence. Further,&#13;
sector resources, at the same time freeing up              overreliance on government transfers or financial&#13;
                                                           subsidies for operation hampers utility efficiency&#13;
government and donor funding for other&#13;
                                                           as these outlays are frequently unpredictable and&#13;
pro-poor service delivery goals.&#13;
                                                           even inadequate.&#13;
To realize these benefits, water utilities must&#13;
                                                           Government-led processes for implementing&#13;

                                                           utility reform can help to improve a utility's&#13;
linked to implementation of reform and resultant&#13;
                                                           creditworthiness. Utility reform focuses mainly&#13;
improvements in operational and financial&#13;
                                                           on sectoral institutional arrangements and,&#13;
performance. The prospect of access to market&#13;
                                                           thus, requires strong political commitment.&#13;
finance can provide an incentive for sustainable&#13;
                                                           However, successfully reformed utilities have&#13;
improved performance.&#13;
                                                           achieved good governance typically through&#13;
                                                           implementation of a clear separation of roles and&#13;
Utility Reforms are a Necessary Step                       responsibilities (for policy, regulation, and service&#13;

Utility reforms are a necessary step to market             over time, introduces higher levels of freedom&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There are observable trends that have emerged                  For several utilities, reform has also resulted&#13;
from reforms undertaken by the six utilities                   in a wider coverage of urban areas, which&#13;
utilities (ref. Box 1):                                        allows greater economies of scale as well as&#13;
                                                               the sharing of risks across a wider customer&#13;
       National or local governments have                      pool. For example, ONEA, SONEDE, SDE/&#13;
       retained asset ownership either through a               SONES and NWSC (Uganda) all serve&#13;
       public asset holding company as in Kenya                other urban centers as well as the city for&#13;
       (the seven asset holding water boards) and              or in which they were established. While&#13;
       Senegal or the government being the sole                this is generally a positive development,&#13;
       shareholder of utilities as in NWSC (Uganda),           the trend raises two potential concerns:&#13;
       SONEDE (Tunisia), ONEA (Burkina Faso),                  first, in countries with a strong focus on&#13;
       Johannesburg Water (South Africa) and                   decentralization, a national utility may&#13;

                                                               second, if service is provided indiscriminately&#13;
       Some utilities such as Johannesburg Water,&#13;
                                                               to small urban centers, without adequate&#13;

       striven to recruit nongovernmental Board&#13;

                                                               (as occurred in Uganda3). This was also&#13;
       and the customer base. This helps the                   the driving force in eThekwini's reform&#13;
       Board to guide the utility to operate on                as its customer base jumped from one&#13;
       commercial principles as well as achieve                million to three million people as a result&#13;
       greater efficiency and responsiveness                   of decentralization and the advent of&#13;
       to customers.                                           democratization in South Africa.&#13;
       A key tool in effecting reform has been the&#13;
       implementation of performance contracts              The government, utility managers and&#13;
       between governments and utilities. These             development partners have cooperated to&#13;
       serve to define roles and responsibilities as        carry out utility reform and transformation in&#13;
       well as establish performance targets within         Africa and many of the case studies reveal high&#13;
       set time frames. Performance contracts can           levels of synergy among the three stakeholders:&#13;
       also limit day to day political interference.&#13;
       Individual performance contracts for                    Government prioritization of and&#13;

       municipality in Durban, South Africa, all               utility reform was spurred by a decline in&#13;
       senior management staff have agreed to                  services and a desire to improve customer&#13;

&amp;#12;How Can Reforming African Water Utilities Tap Local Financial Markets?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Box 1: Examples of Utility Reforms and Emerging Institutional Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
     Several utilities, such as SONES and SDE of Senegal, Nairobi Water and Sewerage&#13;
     Company in Kenya, and Johannesburg Water in South Africa have taken steps within&#13;
     differing regulatory contexts toward fiscal and administrative autonomy. Typically, the&#13;
     process is politically charged and requires considerable negotiations as water&#13;
     ministries and/or local municipalities prefer to retain `ownership' over the cash flow&#13;
     from water services.&#13;
&#13;
     In Senegal, water sector reform resulted in separation of the asset holder and service&#13;
     provider into separate entities. SONES, a public asset-holding company with a 30-&#13;
     year Water Ministry concession, is responsible for overall network maintenance and for&#13;
     regulation of SDE, which is a private operator with an affermage (leasing) contract with&#13;
     the Ministry and SONES. SDE is responsible for service delivery as well as carrying out&#13;
     some network extensions and rehabilitation. The relationship between SONES and SDE&#13;
     is formalized in a performance contract annexed to the affermage contract. This structure&#13;
     is premised on a series of four contracts that are used for regulation in the absence of&#13;
     an autonomous regulator. The framework has helped to clarify roles and responsibilities,&#13;
     while allowing public ownership of the asset base (SONES) in tandem with a private role&#13;
     in service delivery (SDE). The contracts were developed specifically for the Senegalese&#13;
     context and have been successful in practice.&#13;
&#13;
     Utility reforms in Senegal&#13;

     social connections has&#13;
     ensured affordable access&#13;
     for the poor. In addition to successful regulation by contract, use of a financial model has&#13;
     been instrumental in ensuring high performance.&#13;
&#13;
     SONES has also been able to mobilize market resources from domestic Senegalese&#13;
     banks on the basis of its own creditworthiness. SONES and SDE have relied on private&#13;
     finance throughout the reform process. In 1998, Citibank and Compagnie Bancaire de&#13;
     l'Afrique Occidentale (CBAO) extended a line of credit for US$24.1 million over six years,&#13;
     at 9.75 percent interest, as a structured arrangement with an escrow account for debt&#13;
     services and mutually contingent on donor financing being effective. In 2000, the success&#13;
     of the Citibank/CBAO line of credit was followed by a US$7 million direct loan by CBAO&#13;
     to SONES for a Design Build Finance contract, for which additional funding (US$16&#13;
     million) was provided by BOAD. To support these transactions, the government provided a&#13;
     guarantee and a comfort letter to cover political risk.&#13;

JW turned to the private sector and implemented a&#13;
management contract to create a unified, professional company, address various levels of capacity and&#13;
overcome different operating cultures. The contract, which lasted from 2001-2006, resulted in significant&#13;
staff training and capacity-building, a focused, customer-oriented approach, improved revenue&#13;
management, and an improved ability to support the poor. After five years, the utility's financial viability&#13;
had improved considerably, and management reverted back to the JW.&#13;
&#13;
Market funds have been sourced by Johannesburg Municipality over the past several years, initially from&#13;
the Development Bank of South Africa (DBSA) and subsequently through issuance of municipal bonds.&#13;
Initial bond issues were backed by guarantees (USAID's DCA and IFC's Municipal Fund) but later issues&#13;
have been made without such guarantees. Since 2004, bonds worth about R2 billion have been raised&#13;
and the proceeds have been used for different municipal infrastructure including water and sewerage.&#13;
The utility seems to prefer this method of raising financing to the direct mobilization of funds. However,&#13;
JW's tariffs do manage to cover the debt servicing cost for investments in water infrastructure.&#13;

entered into a service provider agreement (SPA) with&#13;
Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company (NWSC), an&#13;
autonomous utility wholly-owned by the Nairobi City&#13;
Council. This new institutional arrangement helps to delineate functions and achieve separation of policy,&#13;
regulation and actual service delivery operations.&#13;
&#13;
Reforms in Kenya remain at an early stage and improvements in operational performance though&#13;
already evident, need to be sustained over the next few years. A key aspect of reform is the composition&#13;
of the Board of Directors for both NWSB and NWSC, which include external members representing&#13;
business and consumers. Plans for mobilization of market resources are under consideration, though&#13;
these are still modest and focus on smaller investments linked to operational improvements.&#13;

  Box 3: Donor Projects in Support of Utility Reform&#13;
&#13;
  Urban Water in Senegal: For a significant part of the 1990s, the World Bank supported&#13;
  Senegal's urban sector. During the preparation of a new project to bring additional water&#13;
  to Dakar, stakeholders decided that reducing Unaccounted-for Water (UFW) was an&#13;
  important goal within the context of overall management improvements. The government,&#13;
  which was keen to retain public assets, cooperated with the World Bank, through a&#13;
  year-long process of planning and design, to put in place an innovative system of&#13;
  contracts, incentives, and institutions. This resulted in the institutional arrangements&#13;
  set out in Box 1 (above), and which have proved very successful. Both the World Bank&#13;
  and Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) extended funding and also helped leverage&#13;
  commercial funding from banks (Citibank and CBAO). BOAD and other donors provided&#13;
  subsequent support to the new companies and the government.&#13;
&#13;
  NWSC (Uganda): In the 10 years between 1988 and 1998, NWSC received considerable&#13;
  donor assistance although this was not focused on utility reform. However, following a&#13;
  comprehensive 2000 study of the urban water supply, the government of Uganda entered&#13;
  into a three-year performance contract with NWSC that enabled the latter to suspend its&#13;
  debt service obligations. Since then, NWSC has received only equity and grant funding&#13;
  from the national government and donors, mainly KfW, the EU and the World Bank.&#13;
  Assistance has also taken the form of technical advice on implementing key reforms&#13;
  which have brought about significant improvements in NWSC's operational performance&#13;
  (see Box 6). Donor pressure also focused on improving NWSC's performance to enable&#13;
  it to meet its debt service obligations and improve creditworthiness. Unlike in Senegal,&#13;
  NWSC is not yet ready to leverage market-based commercial resources despite&#13;
  donor involvement.&#13;
&#13;
  NWSC (Kenya): Overall sector reform in Kenya following passage of the 2002 Water Act&#13;
  resulted in a new institutional framework (see Box 1) and the formation of an&#13;
  asset-holding entity, Nairobi Water Services Board, and an operator, Nairobi Water and&#13;
  Sewerage Company. The World Bank, GTZ and Agence Française de Développement&#13;
  (AFD) provided technical assistance funds for NWSB and NWSC, enabling establishment&#13;
  of good management systems and development of strategic and business plans. The&#13;
  utilities have shown rapid progress and are now ready to explore exploitation of Kenya's&#13;
  relatively well-developed financial sector.&#13;

     Box 7: Improving Operational Performance (ONEA and NWSC Uganda)&#13;
&#13;
     Two of Africa's most successful public utilities, ONEA of Burkina Faso and Uganda's NWSC have&#13;
     made great strides in improving operational performance and have begun to explore accessing&#13;
     market finance. Both utilities agreed management contracts with private sector operators to effect&#13;
     initial improvements and capacity building. NWSC has since implemented private sector principles&#13;
     within the organization.&#13;
&#13;
     After ONEA became a state corporation in 1994, a key impetus for operational improvements has&#13;
     been triennial plan (performance) contracts signed with the government. Since 1993, four contracts&#13;
     have been signed and these are monitored and audited by an international technical auditor.&#13;
     Monitoring is through a financial model set up for this purpose, and which allows tracking of over&#13;
     30 indicators. ONEA's capital investment support from the government is linked to its compliance&#13;
     with these contracts and delivery of improved performance. These contracts thus provide incentives&#13;
     for sustaining performance improvements. In addition, ONEA also used technical assistance from&#13;
     donors to enter into a 2001 management contract with Veolia (Général des Eaux) and Mazars Firm&#13;
     (an integrated, independent and international audit firm) to strengthen financial and accounting&#13;
     operations.&#13;
&#13;
     NWSC has made rapid strides in the past five years as a consequence of several measures: a series&#13;
     of performance contracts between itself and the government of Uganda premised on performance&#13;
     improvements linked to suspension of debt-servicing obligations; a service contract to improve billing&#13;
     and collection in the Kampala service area which accounts for about 70 percent of the water produced&#13;

      by NWSC; and agreement of a contract with an international water operator (Ondeo Services)&#13;
      to manage the Kampala service area between 2002 and 2004. While these contracts were only&#13;
      partially successful in achieving the utility's objectives, NWSC management also introduced `a&#13;
      series of initiatives and training programs aimed at improving productivity and creating a more&#13;
      commercial and customer-oriented culture.' These steps increased staff sensitization and later&#13;
      were incorporated into NWSC's corporate vision. The utility also adopted internal contracts to&#13;
      `mimic private operation,' initially by taking a profit-and-cost-centers approach and later selecting&#13;
      managers for its 14 service areas through internal competition and Internally Delegated Area&#13;
      Management Contracts (IDAMCs). This model was also adopted following expiration in 2004&#13;
      of Ondeo's management contract for Kampala.&#13;
&#13;
      In terms of specific internal strategies, NWSC has used a number of measures such as: making&#13;
      new connections to poor customers by reducing connection fees and covering these costs&#13;
      through an average tariff increase of 10 percent; introducing annual inflation adjustments for&#13;
      water tariffs though these have not been applied to industrial users; implementing innovative&#13;
      measures to ensure better payment from government agencies; improving collection efficiency&#13;
      through better customer relations including standard-based systems for the redressing of&#13;
      grievances, computerized billing systems and increased reliability and continuity of service; and&#13;
      provision of extensive staff training in customer relations. These reforms have been achieved&#13;
      via several short-term tactical initiatives: the 100 Days Program, which is aimed at reversing&#13;
      operational and financial inefficiencies; the Service and Revenue Enhancement Program, which&#13;
      aims to restore customer confidence in NWSC operations; and the Stretch Out Program aimed&#13;
      at improving cash operating margins in regional operations by reducing bureaucracy, enlisting&#13;
      staff and instilling self-confidence.&#13;

3. The Need to Demonstrate and&#13;
Create Space for Market Transactions&#13;
&#13;
Over the past decade, domestic financial                         together to expand cross-border trading within&#13;
markets in Africa have grown considerably,                       Africa. Also, the liquidity in pension funds and&#13;
driven by pension reform, establishment of                       other public financial institutions is high. In&#13;
pension schemes for government employees                         fact, institutional investors in several countries,&#13;
and the introduction of legislation to create                    notably Nigeria, Kenya and Zambia, complain&#13;
mandatory private pension schemes. This has                      of high liquidity and lack of domestic investment&#13;
stimulated domestic capital markets leading to                   opportunities. The emerging financial sector in&#13;
an increase in the sophistication of the banking                 Africa presents a potential opportunity for the&#13;
sector, increased trading activity on bourses and                water sector to raise capital.&#13;
substantially enhanced the likelihood of pension&#13;
fund monies flowing to utilities. The preferred                  Discussions at the Pretoria workshop suggest&#13;
profile for pension funds investments is one with                considerable interest on the part of utilities to&#13;
a long term, low risk and secured returns (often                 explore market finance. In turn, the financial&#13;
at a fixed rate). This profile closely matches the               sector also appears ready to explore the&#13;
preferred funding profile of utilities. Infrastructure           possibility of lending to or investing in water&#13;
investments require long-term funds and fixed                    utilities. Domestic banks generally maintain&#13;
rate terms to minimize tariff shocks. The only                   water utility accounts and have provided&#13;
missing component is real or perceived utility                   working capital or short-term capital for small&#13;
creditworthiness.                                                investments. The potential benefits for the&#13;
                                                                 financial sector include a source of stable,&#13;
In many African countries, real GDP growth                       consistent revenue (for example, by holding&#13;

global demand for commodities has boosted                        investments in the local economy, and a way to&#13;

&#13;
   Box 8: Highlights from Water Utilities' Completed Market Transactions&#13;
&#13;
   Debt mobilization by local authorities in South Africa: Two South African utilities,&#13;
   Johannesburg Water--a public utility wholly owned by the City of Johannesburg (CJ)--and&#13;
   Durban Metro, which is a ring-fenced department of the eThekwini Municipality (EM) rely on&#13;
   their parent municipalities to mobilize debt funds for capital investments. CJ's debt mobilization&#13;
   evolved from an initial borrowing from the state-owned Development Bank of South Africa&#13;
   (DBSA) to issue municipal bonds backed by external agency (IFC and&#13;
   USAID-DCA) guarantees. CJ has taken a lead role in introducing reforms and building investor&#13;
   awareness through roadshows. Its most recent bond was issued without any guarantee, and&#13;
   yet was well priced due to improved ratings. Over the past few years, the City of Johannesburg&#13;
   has mobilized about US$140 million through an initial bond offer. The proceeds have been&#13;
   used for various infrastructure, including water and roads. Johannesburg municipality plans&#13;
   to mobilize about US$820 million over a five-year period. eThekwini Municipality has been&#13;
   more conservative but has also received credit assessments for both long- and short-term&#13;
   borrowings. It has relied on its credit assessment and rating to borrow at more competitive&#13;
   terms from domestic financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
   The development of municipal lending in South Africa in recent periods has benefited from&#13;
   the Government of South Africa's Financial Charter, which classifies municipal infrastructure&#13;
   as a priority. All banks and financial institutions have voluntarily agreed with the government&#13;
   on a five-year target of R23 billion for investment in municipal infrastructure This has made&#13;
   it necessary for FIs to seek out markets in this sector and spurred growth in business on&#13;
   competitive terms. However, such directed credit may be unsustainable if it distorts pricing.&#13;
   However, the financial and municipal sectors have developed strong relations and competition&#13;
   has been stimulated, and these developments may sustain lending after initial targets have&#13;
   been reached.&#13;
&#13;
   Investments through Public-private Partnerships (PPPs): Three utilities have entered into&#13;
   PPPs to mobilize investments but each has taken a different approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                          29&#13;
&amp;#12;How Can Reforming African Water Utilities Tap Local Financial Markets?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     For SONES of Senegal, initial mobilization of market funds was a prerequisite for&#13;
     donor assistance. In turn, donor participation and government involvement provided&#13;
     the necessary assurance to investors. Over time, through successful implementation of&#13;
     reforms and significant improvements in operational performance, SONES has been on&#13;
     the basis of its own creditworthiness, able to source funds from domestic banks. SONES&#13;
     and SDE have relied on private finance throughout the reform process. Initially, Citibank&#13;
     and CBAO offered a US$24.1 million line of credit over six years at 9.75 percent interest.&#13;
     This was a structured arrangement with an escrow account for debt services. A World&#13;
     Bank loan also provided the necessary comfort to sustain the momentum of reform. The&#13;
     success of the Citibank/CBAO line of credit was followed up in 2000 with a direct loan to&#13;
     SONES, also extended by CBAO, for US$7 million, and further funding was obtained from&#13;
     BOAD (US$16 million). These transactions were supported by Government guarantee in&#13;
     terms of a comfort letter to cover political risk.&#13;
&#13;
     SONEDE is an efficient and successful utility that services all the urban areas in Tunisia.&#13;
     It has a consistent record of good operational performance. Most of its major capital&#13;
     investment requirements have been funded through loans from bilateral or multilateral&#13;
     institutions. Its market funding is limited to small amounts from domestic institutions to&#13;
     finance connection loans and for renewal. The market transaction to pursue connection&#13;
     loans to its customers was necessary to meet SONEDE's medium-term financing needs&#13;
     and cover a three-year extension from five to eight years. For smaller needs, such as&#13;
     renewing total vehicle stock, SONEDE has mobilized about 12 million dinars (US$9&#13;
     million) through seven loans from three domestic banks with a maturity of seven years and&#13;
     a variable interest rate.&#13;
&#13;
     SONEDE has met at least 40 percent of its overall capital investments through its own&#13;
     operating surplus. For large projects expected to begin in the next five years, SONEDE&#13;
     plans to assess the possibility of sourcing funding from domestic banks. Recently,&#13;
     SONEDE has sought to mobilize funding of about 61 million dinar (US$47 million) for its&#13;
     desalination plant on the island of Jerba through a public-private partnership arrangement&#13;
     according to a BOO or BOT model.&#13;
&#13;
     Silulumanzi (Greater Nelspruit Utility Company), South Africa, was formed in 1999&#13;
     following termination of a 30-year concession agreement between the Nelspruit&#13;
     Transitional Local Council (NTLC) and a private consortium. The contract allowed the&#13;
     Council to retain ownership while accessing private sector capital. Silulumanzi Company&#13;
     financed capital investments by combining NTLC funds using Municipal Infrastructure&#13;
     Grants (MIGs) with its own sources as well as commercial borrowing and contributions&#13;
     from developers. This was possible despite a large proportion of low-income consumers&#13;
     because of cross-subsidization with revenue from industrial and other high-income&#13;
     customers. Silulumanzi was viable because of operational efficiency, reliable services,&#13;
     service area expansion, agreed tariff increases per the contract and the government and&#13;
     private operator's shared long-term outlook. From 2005 to 2007, about US$11 million was&#13;
     invested in the capital works program, of which about 50 percent came in the form of&#13;

     grants and the balance mobilized by GNUC mainly through its own equity as well as&#13;
     borrowing. The total capital works program is roughly equivalent to US$27 million.&#13;
&#13;
     Pooled financing for small municipalities in India: India has relatively well-developed&#13;
     financial markets. The huge funding gaps experienced by smaller municipalities in building&#13;
     municipal infrastructure posed a major constraint as, individually, they were unable to&#13;
     access market funding. An innovative strategy of pooled financing has been used in two&#13;
     states (Tamil Nadu and Karnataka) to enable smaller municipalities to gain access to&#13;
     market funds. Using these Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), Tamil Nadu mobilized&#13;
     US$8 million and Karnataka US$25 million using 15-year debt instruments through private&#13;
     placement with domestic commercial banks, financial institutions and insurance agencies.&#13;
     The bond issue enjoyed tax-free status and was priced at about 200 basis points below&#13;
     market rates for taxable paper. The proceeds were used for water and sewerage projects.&#13;
&#13;
     Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF) facilitated the Tamil Nadu offering,&#13;
     which allowed risk diversification by including a mix of municipalities at various levels&#13;
     of creditworthiness. However, as the underlying municipalities were poorly rated, credit&#13;
     enhancements were necessary. In carrying out transactions of this type, it is important&#13;
     to assess whether borrowing will spur introduction of reforms and improve municipal&#13;
     performance and creditworthiness.&#13;

Some form of credit enhancement is typically                    invest in utility bonds, when these are issued.&#13;

Financial institutions and banks also perceive                  least initially. While most transactions reviewed&#13;

      Zambia's Nkana Water and Sewerage Company (NWSC) was created in 1998. In addition&#13;
      to water and sewerage, the utility also provides solid waste management services. Over&#13;
      the past five years, NWSC has improved operational performance in some key indicators&#13;
      though there is still scope to reduce Unaccounted-for Water (UFW), which is attributable in&#13;
      part to low levels of metering. To implement full metering will require about 46,000 domestic&#13;
      meters, as well as district meters and valves, at an estimated cost of US$10 million. An initial&#13;
      project proposal prepared by NWSC suggests that it would be possible to repay market debt&#13;
      from anticipated operational improvements. NWSC followed up contacts established at the&#13;
      workshop in Pretoria and has begun to explore funding through financial institutions on its&#13;
      own credit.&#13;
&#13;
      Burkina Faso's ONEA has shown remarkable success despite the country's very low per&#13;
      capita income. Its healthy performance now suggests the possibility of developing market&#13;
      access for some capital investments. ONEA has established links with local banks in order to&#13;
      expand services provided to ONEA, including providing investment credits.&#13;
&#13;
      However, ONEA must first address such concerns such as the Finance Ministry's regulatory&#13;
      framework, which limits borrowing by a state-owned enterprise. The Government of Burkina&#13;
      Faso is willing, however, to allow ONEA access to some market funds. Further, ONEA must&#13;
      also assess its creditworthiness and possible pricing for different types of debt. This may&#13;
      be done through support for a shadow rating of ONEA. In addition, ONEA will also need to&#13;
      choose between seeking loans from local banks versus issuing bonds. The latter may prove&#13;
      more cost-effective in the long term but will require greater readiness for the use of funds.&#13;
      Finally, ONEA should carefully assess the ramifications for tariff levels of offering market debt&#13;
      and explore the possibility of implementing smart subsidies to maintain affordability for&#13;
      low-income customers.&#13;
&#13;
      NWSC Uganda has, over the past few years, shown good results and achieved significant&#13;
      improvements in operational performance, financial health, and compliance with contracts&#13;
      agreed with the government of Uganda. The government is considering converting&#13;
      NWSC debt into equity to create space on its balance sheet. NWSC plans to develop new&#13;
      infrastructure and also improve asset management, and this reform will allow it to be more&#13;
      proactive in deciding on its financing strategy.&#13;
&#13;
      NWSC is considering tapping market resources for some of these requirements if two of its&#13;
      concerns can be addressed. First, the utility wants to assess its own creditworthiness to&#13;

    determine the type of debt it should use as well as the likely pricing it will face. In this way,&#13;
    NWSC will also better understand the debt load that can be reasonably sustained. To this&#13;
    end, there are plans to provide support to carry out a shadow rating (see Box 12 on Pg 38)&#13;
    to develop a better understanding of potential markets, and as a basis for negotiations with&#13;
    potential lenders/investors. The use of donor funds to leverage private sector finance proves&#13;
    that access to market finance does not obviate or make redundant donor funds. NWSC's&#13;
    development of an investment plan is a first step to develop a financing strategy linked to&#13;
    sources of potential finance.&#13;

close cooperation between the water sector                 certain prudential limits and invest in higher rated&#13;

While opportunities for credit rating, project             formal ratings and, in such cases, there is some&#13;

even these are rarely exploited in Africa, which           essentially mirror formal ratings but are not done&#13;

Credit ratings may facilitate subsequent                   A shadow credit rating can even instill in a utility&#13;

make an independent assessment of                          and enable identification of areas for reform. The&#13;
potential borrowers.                                       process can also help identify possible forms of&#13;

Credit ratings allow independent assessment                This would allow the borrower to approach a&#13;
of potential borrowers and related project/                formal rating agency with a credit enhancement&#13;

&#13;
      Examples of project support facilities that emerged during the workshop in Pretoria (such&#13;
      as Devco and Infraco of the Private Infrastructure Development Group--PIDG) suggest&#13;
      there is scope for transaction support at different stages in the project development&#13;
      cycle. A recent study by ICA-PPIAF identified the financing facilities available in Sub-&#13;
      Saharan Africa, toward promoting understanding and publicizing who does what, and&#13;
      how a potential project developer could mix and match with respect to different sources of&#13;

      definition; iii) project feasibility assessment; iv) project structuring; v) transaction support;&#13;
      and vi) postimplementation support. The study found that although support is available for&#13;
      the first three phases, there is less emphasis on the last three, which points up a gap in&#13;
      actual project structuring and transaction support during implementation.&#13;

  Box 15: Effective Use of Project Development Assistance Requires&#13;
  On-the-ground Professional Assistance&#13;
&#13;
  The government of Kenya has made a determined effort to partner with small-scale water&#13;
  providers, putting in place a basic legal and regulatory framework to support these efforts. But&#13;
  a host of problems hamper the role of small-scale providers as productive partners, including&#13;
  their lack of access to finance.&#13;
&#13;
  A collaborative effort facilitated by the Water and Sanitation Program is bringing together&#13;
  community-based organizations and a commercial microfinance bank to provide better water&#13;
  services to poor people--and generating lessons for similar initiatives. WSP Africa, through&#13;
  its head office in Nairobi, has catalyzed the creation of synergy among a number of players,&#13;
  including the Kenyan government, community organizations, commercial microfinance&#13;
  bank (K-Rep Bank), the Global Partnership on Output-based Aid (GPOBA), and the Public&#13;
  Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF). The initiative is currently being rolled out in&#13;
  21 communities, with continued support from WSP-Af and the GoK's project management&#13;
  committee, which provides overall oversight and coordination. WSP-Af has managed the&#13;
  process of seeking assistance from various facilities, supported the PMC and the K-Rep Bank,&#13;
  and managed the key activities that make up the project development process.&#13;

that have occurred, such as the DCA guarantee                 activities and products of several development&#13;

&#13;
   Box 16: Existing Credit Enhancement Agencies and Products&#13;
&#13;
   Partial guarantees from multilateral agencies: The World Bank, European Investment&#13;
   Bank (EIB), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and African&#13;
   Development Bank (AfDB) all offer partial guarantee products. However, these remain little&#13;
   used by the water sector.&#13;
&#13;
   Specialized guarantee products for infrastructure: USAID's Development Credit Authority&#13;
   (DCA) followed its earlier housing guarantee program. DCA operates in local currency and&#13;
   has had some experience in water linked to pooled financing in India. Another new facility,&#13;
   Guarantco, is part of the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG). Guarantco is new&#13;
   and has not had any exposure to the water sector so far.&#13;

&#13;
     General insurance facilities: Several other insurance facilities are available, such as Africa&#13;
     Export Credit Facility (AECF) and Africa Trade Insurance. Insurance can be used for credit&#13;
     enhancement. So far, there has not been any use of these in the water supply sector.&#13;
&#13;
     Focus on subnational transactions: Utilities may also be constrained by low sovereign ratings&#13;
     for mobilizing external funds. However, in recent years, a number of financial institutions have&#13;
     increased their focus on subsovereign lending and other products. In particular, both EBRD and&#13;
     EIB have a large subnational portfolio, in which performance has been good. IFC has established&#13;
     a special window through its Municipal Fund. Based on these experiences, the World Bank&#13;
     Group plans to expand its presence in the subsovereign market segment.&#13;

            How can reforming African water utilities
            tap local financial markets?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Water utilities that rely entirely on
            public funding for capital investment often fall short in
            mobilizing resources and are, therefore, unable to sustain
            improvement in service delivery. In addition to sector
            governance reform and improved financial viability, there is
            a need for innovative strategies to bridge gaps in financing
            as highlighted by reports from important recent panels such
            as those chaired by Michel Camdessus and Angel Gurria. Both
            these panels have advocated the need to access funds from
            domestic financial markets. The workshop focused on two
            finance related obstacles to achieving the Millennium
            Development Goals (MDGs) on water and sanitation:
            mobilization of additional funding resources to develop the
            water sector; and ensuring that these investments result in
            sustainable service delivery. The workshop's program
            focused on three themes: a) reforms and practical strategies
            to improve performance and market access for water utilities
            based on lessons gleaned from prior utility reform and
            market transaction; b) assessing utility readiness from the
            perspective of financing institutions and credit rating
            agencies, and undertaking measures to improve
            creditworthiness and financial viability; and c) reviewing
            opportunities for innovative financing to facilitate
            transactions in the urban water supply sector. Workshop
            discussions were augmented and informed by the presentation
            of case studies of six utilities as well as a survey
            assessing the readiness of fourteen utilities (including the
            six case study utilities) to tap into financial markets. The
            case studies have since been developed further and are
            available as an adjunct to this paper, which will present
            the key lessons that emerged from workshop deliberations as
            well as follow-up activities, including a Kenya country
            workshop and transaction support activity in Burkina Faso
            and Uganda.
