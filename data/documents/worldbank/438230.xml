Abstract&#13;
This study focuses on the likely long-term trends in investment,&#13;
production and trade patterns in the world aluminum industry. It first&#13;
introduces the non-specialist reader to the technical characteristics of&#13;
bauxite mining and the production of alumina and aluminum. Special emphasis&#13;
is placed on the critical importance of energy requirements. Next, a verbal&#13;
description of the method of analysis is presented. A detailed technical&#13;
statement of the mathematical programming model, and the associated data input&#13;
are provided in two annexes to the study.&#13;
The results obtained are mostly of a normative nature rather than&#13;
predictions. Therefore, tariffs and levies are not considered in most&#13;
scenarios. Extensive sensitivity analysis is carried out, focusing on an&#13;
alternative demand forecast, higher capital costs, varying cost and&#13;
availability of electricity, and different trade strategies. In that context,&#13;
an attempt is made to determine the impact of tariffs and levies.&#13;
The main conclusion drawn from the analysis is that the emerging&#13;
pattern of investment, production and trade is very robust in the light of the&#13;
changes that were made in the main parameters, particularly for bauxite and&#13;
aluminum. The abundance of relatively accessible bauxite and low-cost&#13;
electricity from hydrosources and natural gas in many developing countries&#13;
appears to have caused a noticeable shift in comparative advantage, in the&#13;
sense that most of the required additional productive capacity for bauxite,&#13;
alumina and aluminum would be located there in the future. However, Australia&#13;
is under certain circumstances an attractive location for bauxite production&#13;
and processing activities while Canada, due to its abundant hydroelectric&#13;
resources, shows potential for additional aluminum smelter capacity.&#13;
Furthermore, considering the expected long-term conditions, already installed&#13;
plants in OECD countries could remain competitive, as long as they are able to&#13;
survive through the current depressed situation of the industry.&#13;
Most alumina and aluminum plants in OECD countries will continue&#13;
operating for two main reasons. First, capital expenditures have already been&#13;
made, thus representing a sunk cost, and additional investment requirements to&#13;
modernize and increase efficiency of these plants are low compared to the cost&#13;
of establishing new plants. By contrast, new investments in developing&#13;
countries require not only expenditures for plant and equipment but also for&#13;
infrastructure development. Second, although electricity costs for new&#13;
projects may be significantly lower in the developing countries with cheap&#13;
energy sources, they are significantly higher than before. Moreover, long-&#13;
term contracts on low-cost electricity supplies for existing smelters and the&#13;
possibility of generating medium-cost electricity from coal and nuclear power&#13;
should moderate the difference in electricity costs among regions. Therefore,&#13;
although new aluminum projects implemented in the regions with low cost&#13;
electricity may result in energy cost savings over some existing smelters,&#13;
these savings may not compensate for the capital costs which would be incurred&#13;
in developing the new projects and building the required infrastructure.&#13;

Preface&#13;
This is a study that the World Bank and the OECD have conducted&#13;
focusing on possible shifts in comparative advantage in the aluminum sector.&#13;
While emphasizing the preliminary nature of our results, we gratefully&#13;
acknowledge the advice and assistance that we have received from industry&#13;
specialists. Mr. Richard C. Roberts, consultant, has provided us with&#13;
constant advice throughout the study, and has, in particular, helped us&#13;
understand the technical and economic characteristics of the aluminum&#13;
industry, based upon a lifetime of practical experience.&#13;
We are also grateful to OECD for the opportunity to present an&#13;
earlier version of this study to the Group of Delegates on the Aluminum&#13;
Industry in Paris, November 1981. We received many important suggestions and&#13;
comments from industry representatives at that meeting and are especially&#13;
grateful to ALCAN Aluminum Ltd. for subsequent detailed comments and&#13;
criticism.&#13;
One of the authors visited the International Bauxite Association in&#13;
Kingston, Jamaica several times during the study; we gratefully acknowledge&#13;
the help of the IBA staff, and would like to mention specifically Messrs. Rob&#13;
Robson, Paul Frame, Luke Baumgardner, Aldo Barsotti and Gary Peterson of the&#13;
U.S. Bureau of Mines, who were very helpful. Professor Ebbe Yndgaard of the&#13;
University of Aarhus, Denmark, provided useful suggestions on the study.&#13;
Within the World Bank, we benefited from the assistance and comments&#13;
of several colleagues, in particular, Mrs. Marianne Haug, Messrs. Kenji&#13;
Takeuchi, James Fish, Edwin Moore and John Strongman. We are grateful to&#13;
them. We are deeply indebted to Messrs. Piet Bleyendaal and Sethu Palaniappan&#13;
for their meticulous assistance in the numerical analysis.&#13;

1. Introduction&#13;
1.1 Approach and Aims of the Analysis&#13;
International discussions on the future structure of world industry,&#13;
and concomitant trading patterns, have often not been based on systematic&#13;
analysis of comparative advantage. This is regrettable, as it may be assumed&#13;
that most of the important decisions with regard to future investment,&#13;
production and trade patterns will continue to be heavily influenced by cost&#13;
considerations which are amenable to such analysis, rather than by target-&#13;
setting by international agencies, or by arguments based upon some perception&#13;
of equity as often expressed on behalf of the developing countries as a group.&#13;
At the same time, it should be recognized that the systematic&#13;
analysis of an industry, even if confined to a single industrial sub-sector,&#13;
on a world-wide basis, is fraught with difficulties. First, and foremost, the&#13;
establishment of a good data base is a major undertaking. It is one thing to&#13;
reach a certain degree of agreement on information that describes the&#13;
technological characteristics of a given industrial activity, such as the&#13;
specification of input-output relationships. It is quite another thing to&#13;
arrive at a consensus with regard to data that require a certain amount of&#13;
judgment, such as the availability and quality of factors of production,&#13;
future market requirements, investment costs, and so on. Finally, there are&#13;
factors which are difficult to quantify, or that can be quantified by proxy&#13;
only, mostly related to risk and uncertainty. Opinions may not only differ&#13;
with regard to the nature of such factors and the weight to be attached to&#13;
them, but also to the appropriate manner of treatment.&#13;
In addition to severe data problems, difficulties arise with regard&#13;
to the appropriate method of analysis. Some of us have described in detail&#13;
the complexities associated with sector-wide industrial investment analysis,&#13;
even in a single country, and in particular, for industrial activities that&#13;
exhibit economies of scale. 1/ In fact, it is now commonly acknowledged that&#13;
one is dependent upon computerized manipulation of the data and assumptions if&#13;
one wishes to carry out systematic investment analysis that explicitly takes&#13;
into account interdependencies among decisions on timing, location, scale,&#13;
technology and product mix of new productive investment. Clearly, if such&#13;
analysis is difficult for a single country, it must cause serious problems in&#13;
the case of a world-wide analysis.&#13;
To assess the feasibility of a systematic analysis of an industry on&#13;
a worldwide basis and achieve results that are meaningful from a policy point&#13;
of view, we have selected the world aluminum industry as the subject of a case&#13;
study. From the start, we should emphasize that the objective of this study&#13;
is not to present a blueprint for the world-wide development of this&#13;
particular industry, but that it is considerably more modest in its aims.&#13;
1/ See, for example, David Kendrick and Ardy Stoutjesdijk, The Planning of&#13;
Industrial Investment Programs, Vol. 1 in: Alex Meeraus and Ardy&#13;
Stoutjesdijk (Eds.) The Planning of Investment Programs, 1978.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
First, we have made an attempt to put together a data base for the industry.&#13;
We were in a relatively favorable position to do so. Both the OECD and the&#13;
World Bank have direct access to primary information on the industry and&#13;
international trade in its product§, the former by virtue of its coordinating&#13;
function vis-a-vis OECD member countries, the latter through its project&#13;
lending activities, and the extensive commodity analysis that feeds into its&#13;
project appraisal. Moreover, in the course of the study, we have benefitted&#13;
from the detailed advice of several of the large aluminum companies, the&#13;
International Bauxite Association, and individual consultants with special&#13;
expertise in this field. Finally, we have been able to survey systematically&#13;
the available published information on the industry from a wide variety of&#13;
sources, including World Bank project documents.&#13;
Nevertheless, we recognize--and emphasize--that the data base&#13;
presented in this study, and underlying the analysis, is no more than a first&#13;
attempt at assembling one and leaves considerable room for improvement. To&#13;
the extent deficiencies lie in the technical quality of the data used,&#13;
subsequent efforts at verification or improvement are needed. When they&#13;
relate to judgmental data, however, it is important to establish close links&#13;
to potential users of this type of analysis in order to ascertain their views&#13;
on appropriate magnitudes. Most of the data, assumptions and projections used&#13;
in our analysis fall into the latter category, and it should therefore not be&#13;
surprising that we make no attempt to present the study as a definitive one in&#13;
any way. The emphasis will be on the type of results that can be attained&#13;
with the analytic approach we have selected, in the hope that this will&#13;
provide an incentive to some of our diverse audiences to assist us in a&#13;
continuing process of improvement of data, assumptions and projections.&#13;
The second objective of our study is to demonstrate that it is&#13;
possible to design a framework of analysis that incorporates the main&#13;
characteristics of the industry's structure, and employ it efficiently to&#13;
address a number of pertinent questions regarding its future development. In&#13;
describing this framework, we shall emphasize the multitude of uses to which&#13;
it can be put, recognizing that different audiences may have diverse needs.&#13;
1.2 Organization of the Study&#13;
In the next section, we shall give a brief description of the&#13;
industry. This is followed by Section 3 in which we present most of the data,&#13;
assumptions and projections used in the analysis. In Section 4, some of the&#13;
main economic questions to be addressed in a worldwide study of the industry&#13;
and the method of analysis will be presented, and, in annexes to that section,&#13;
a complete statement of the model and its numerical information, in GAMS&#13;
language, is given. 1/ In Section 5 the types of results that can be obtained&#13;
with this model are described, including a certain amount of sensitivity&#13;
analysis. Section 6 contains the main conclusions.&#13;
1/  GAMS is a computer-readable language to describe a model and associated&#13;
data that places minimal demands upon non-specialists for understanding&#13;
the model's structure.&#13;

2. The Aluminum Sector&#13;
In this section, we shall provide a brief technological description&#13;
of the industry, primarily addressed to those that are not familiar with the&#13;
characteristics of products and processes that are important to the sector.&#13;
Readers that are familiar with the technical aspects of the aluminum sector&#13;
can skip this section without loss of continuity.&#13;
2.1 General Overview&#13;
Bauxite, a rock consisting chiefly of hydrated alumina and hydroxide&#13;
minerals is the principal raw material for aluminum. Most of the bauxite&#13;
produced in the world is processed into alumina at refineries, and the latter&#13;
product is converted into aluminum in electrolytic smelters. Additionally,&#13;
there are also smelters that process new and used aluminum scrap into&#13;
secondary aluminum. Minor amounts of bauxite and alumina, both hydrated and&#13;
calcined, are consumed by the refractory, abrasive and chemical industries.&#13;
(Figure 1 presents a flow chart of the sector, for reference throughout this&#13;
section).&#13;
Aluminum has varied applications: its strength, low density and&#13;
pleasant appearance have made it useful in motor vehicles, in machinery and&#13;
equipment and in construction; due to its low density and high electrical&#13;
conductivity, aluminum has displaced copper in a series of electrical uses;&#13;
because of its resistance to corrosion it has partially replaced tin and steel&#13;
in the packaging industries.&#13;
The aluminum industry is vertically and horizontally integrated.&#13;
Over sixty percent of the world's productive capacity for bauxite and alumina&#13;
and over half of the world's aluminum capacity (excluding Centrally Planned&#13;
Economies) is owned and operated by six corporations: ALCOA, ALCAN, Pechiney&#13;
(PUK), Reynolds, Alusuisse and Kaiser. Because of trading patterns, high&#13;
investment requirements, economies of scale, as well as proprietary&#13;
technology, these multinational companies have tended to be associated with&#13;
many new projects in the sector. However, more or less independent producers&#13;
are emerging, particularly in developing countries, which may have important&#13;
long-run consequences for the international structure of the industry.&#13;
Prices of bauxite, alumina and aluminum reflect the high degree of&#13;
concentration of the industry. There are no market price quotations for&#13;
bauxite or alumina, prices being set mainly by companies for their internal&#13;
accounting and/or to comply with host government regulations. In the case of&#13;
aluminum, producer prices of the major producers set the price patterns (about&#13;
80 percent of primary aluminum production is transferred from the primary&#13;
producer/smelters to subsidiary operations producing semifabricates); dealer&#13;
or free market prices are also quoted; and since 1977 aluminum has been quoted&#13;
in the London Metal Exchange. 1/&#13;

Until the decade of the forties, bauxite, alumina and aluminum were&#13;
produced mainly in Europe, the Soviet Union, the United States and to a lesser&#13;
extent in the Guianas (only bauxite). Thus, during this period, the entire&#13;
production cycle remained principally concentrated in the industrial nations&#13;
near to the major metal markets. Cost considerations drove the aluminum&#13;
companies to seek new supplies of bauxite after World War II which was&#13;
reflected in the rise of Guyana and Suriname as the main producers of bauxite,&#13;
supplying mainly North America. The bauxite/aluminum industry followed a&#13;
pattern of increased internationalization with the appearance of new important&#13;
producers: Jamaica in the early fifties and Australia and Guinea in the&#13;
sixties. This distinction between producing and consuming countries was&#13;
emphasized in 1974 by the creation of the International Bauxite Association&#13;
which was composed solely of bauxite producing nations.&#13;
Since the period of the early 1960-s the geographical distribution of&#13;
alumina production has followed partially that of bauxite. By locating&#13;
alumina refineries near to the mines, transport costs as well as some&#13;
processing costs are reduced (per ton of aluminum content); but in less&#13;
developed areas investment costs may be higher; and in some cases some private&#13;
sector companies have concern about the security of their large investments.&#13;
In 1979, developing countries produced 51% of world bauxite production,&#13;
centrally planned economies 13%, and industrial nations produced 36% (includes&#13;
Australia at 31%); alumina production in this same period was 20%, 17% and 63%&#13;
respectively. 1/&#13;
Primary aluminum production is energy intensive, approximately 13,500&#13;
kwh of electricity being needed to produce one metric ton of aluminum, with&#13;
today's technology. Thus, the availability of sufficient supplies of low cost&#13;
energy is one of the critical factors determining the location of smelters. A&#13;
large number of smelters built before the 1973 energy crisis, are located in&#13;
industrial countries which previously had access to relatively inexpensive&#13;
oil, natural gas, or hydroelectric power. Some of these smelters are now&#13;
being forced to close down, due to rising energy costs, since their fuel&#13;
sources have alternative markets. Japan has been the most striking case,&#13;
where aluminum smelting capacity is being reduced by one-third. Some smelters&#13;
in the U.S., mainly those which depend on natural gas, are also closing&#13;
down. Meanwhile, some plants have their own captive sources of energy or&#13;
possess long term contracts for the supply of power permitting longer-term&#13;
adjustment to changed relative prices.&#13;
These trends point toward a shift in aluminum industry patterns: new&#13;
smelters will be located in regions with untapped energy sources which have&#13;
little or no alternative uses, as may be the case of hydropower, flared gas&#13;
and low quality coal. Since these relatively low cost sources of energy are&#13;
mostly located in developing countries and in Australia, consuming countries&#13;
are likely to become more dependent on imported aluminum. This is reflected&#13;
in the fact that while primary aluminum output from developing countries was&#13;
3.2 percent of world output in 1960, it increased to 13.7 percent in 1979. At&#13;
the same time, developed countries in 1960 produced 77 percent of world&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
primary aluminum and consumed 74 percent, while by 1979 they produced 65&#13;
percent and consumed 67 percent of world aluminum.&#13;
One source of uncertainty for these trends relates to the future of&#13;
nuclear energy. The large scale development of nuclear power could reverse&#13;
the trend and improve the competitive position of the industrial countries in&#13;
energy-intensive industries.&#13;
2.2 Bauxite Deposits and Characteristics&#13;
Aluminum is the most abundant metal in nature, representing about 8.2&#13;
percent of the earth's crust. Unlike many other metals it is not found in the&#13;
earth in metallic form, but it is a common constituent of many minerals, where&#13;
it is normally present in combination with silicon and oxygen, with hydroxyl&#13;
groups, with iron, titanium, calcium and to a lesser extent, with fluorine,&#13;
phosphorus and boron. 1/&#13;
The bauxite ores, gibbsite, boehmite and diaspore, which are&#13;
currently the main sources of aluminum, account for only a small part of the&#13;
aluminum found in the world. Other potential sources of aluminum may be&#13;
classified as follows:&#13;
a.   Igneous rocks, the most important being anorthosite,&#13;
nepheline syenite and phonolite. Of these, nepheline&#13;
syenite has the highest commercial importance occurring&#13;
in sufficient quantity for commerical development in&#13;
Canada, the USSR, Norway and the United States.&#13;
b.   Sedimentary rocks, such as clays and shales.  Although&#13;
the high-alumina clays constitute a potential source of&#13;
alumina, these have high commercial value due to their&#13;
applications in the ceramics, refractories, chemical&#13;
and paper industries. Shales have low alumina content;&#13;
therefore, alumina from shales is economically feasible&#13;
only as a byproduct.&#13;
c.   Metamorphic and metasomatized rocks, of which alunite is&#13;
the most promising. The main problem with alunite as a&#13;
source of alumina, is that the larger deposits contain&#13;
numerous impurities which interfere with the extraction&#13;
process, and that the sale of various commercial byproducts&#13;
is necessary for the economic viability of the process.&#13;
In summary, aluminum is technically obtainable from non-bauxite sources, and&#13;
therefore, these could be developed for strategic considerations, but at&#13;
present the Bayer bauxite process has significantly lower costs than those of&#13;

alternative processes. Therefore, since it is unlikely that any of these non-&#13;
bauxite sources of alumina will become important for the aluminum industry&#13;
during the twentieth century, the remainder of this section focuses on the&#13;
distribution and characteristics of the world's bauxite resources. 1/&#13;
Bauxite deposits may be divided into two classes: karstic and&#13;
lateritic. 2/ Karstic bauxites are associated with limestones, are usually&#13;
finer than lateritic bauxites and tend to have a higher iron content.&#13;
Lateritic bauxites are found with aluminosilicate rocks and are much coarser&#13;
grained. The structure of the deposits and the impurities found are different&#13;
for these two classes of deposits.&#13;
From the point of view of bauxite processing conditions at alumina&#13;
refineries, the most important classification distinguishes bauxites according&#13;
to the aluminum oxyhydroxide minerals present, which influence mainly the&#13;
temperature and pressure required for refining: 3/&#13;
a.   Trihydrate type, A1203 . 3H20, with gibbsite as the main mineral and&#13;
boehmite content of less than 3 percent.&#13;
b.   Monohydrate boehmite type, A1203 . H20, including monohydrate&#13;
bauxite with low amounts of diaspore.&#13;
c.   Mixed types, which contain gibbsite as the predominant aluminum&#13;
mineral but with boehmite content over 5 percent of the aluminum&#13;
ore.&#13;
d.   Monohydrate mixed bauxite, where boehmite is the predominant&#13;
aluminum mineral but diaspore content exceeds 5 percent.&#13;
Of these types of bauxite, trihydrates are the cheapest to process, due to&#13;
lower temperature and pressure requirements, and monohydrates the most&#13;
expensive; while the processing costs for mixed tri-monohydrates are somewhere&#13;
in between. Among the monohydrates, diaspore is the most difficult to treat.&#13;
Apart from the bauxite types, some other factors are important in&#13;
determining the alumina plant design and processing conditions, consequently&#13;
affecting refining costs. The bauxite to alumina ratio ranges from 2:1 to&#13;
3.4:1, and therefore establishes the amount of bauxite necessary to produce&#13;
one ton of alumina and also provides an indication of the amount of impurities&#13;
present in the ore (a pure gibbsite would show a bauxite-alumina ratio of&#13;
1.53). However, the type of impurities in the bauxite are as important as the&#13;

Bauxite Association.&#13;

bauxite-alumina ratio. The most objectionable impurity is reactive silica,&#13;
which is chemically combined in clay mineral silicates; in many cases non-&#13;
reactive silica is not particularly important and occurs as quartz, sand,&#13;
chalcedony, etc. 1/ Some of the main impurities such as iron and titania are&#13;
essentially insoluble, their main effect being that they require sufficient&#13;
additional equipment to separate them mechanicaly from the bauxite after&#13;
digestion. The most prevalent of the insoluble impurities are iron, calcium,&#13;
magnesium, titanium and manganese. Among other impurities worth mentioning&#13;
are the highly soluble ones, which affect processing conditions but do not&#13;
affect alumina purity, such as organic carbon, carbonates, chlorides and&#13;
sulfates. For a technical description of how impurities influence processing&#13;
conditions and output quality, see Teas and Kotte. 2/&#13;
Besides the type and quality of the bauxite, mining costs must be&#13;
taken into consideration in evaluating bauxite deposits. Infrastructure&#13;
requirements, dimension of the deposits, thickness of the overburden and&#13;
transportation needs, are factors which affect significantly the cost of&#13;
bauxite production. Another important set of issues affecting investment&#13;
decisions in bauxite mines consists of government policies regarding taxation,&#13;
mining laws, security of investment and other related aspects (see Section 3&#13;
for taxation policies).&#13;
Table 1 presents the characteristics of main bauxite deposits&#13;
throughout the world. This table presents a summarized view on the location&#13;
of the deposits, estimates of economic reserves, amount of overburden as&#13;
reflected in the strip ratio, type and quality of the bauxite and process&#13;
requirements, and average distances to ports or refineries. The data on&#13;
reserves has been obtained from various sources (U.S. Geological Survey, U.S.&#13;
Bureau of Mines, International Bauxite Association) and includes those&#13;
deposits considered exploitable within the next two decades. The other&#13;
information, appearing in the table has also been obtained from a variety of&#13;
sources, including the use of a consultant with ample experience in the&#13;
industry. 3/&#13;
The total economic reserves shown in Table 1, amount to over 22.8&#13;
billion metric tons, enough to supply the world's requirements for over one&#13;
hundred years. It may be appreciated that the countries with the largest&#13;
known reserves, in order of importance include: Guinea, Australia, Brazil and&#13;
Jamaica, representing 70 percent of the world total. This table shows also,&#13;
that most Western and Eastern European bauxites are expensive to mine because&#13;
of the overburden and are also costly to process due to their diaspore&#13;
content. In The United States, because of low quality bauxite, a soda-sinter&#13;
process is required for refining local bauxite into alumina. China uses a&#13;

sinter process to recover alumina from diaspore. Among the deposits shown,&#13;
those in Venezuela, Cameroon, Ghana, Kalimantan in Indonesia, and&#13;
Tougue/Dabola/Kindia in Guinea, are undeveloped, requiring heavy expenditures&#13;
for their exploitation and infrastructure development.&#13;
Most of the bauxite produced in the world is mined by open-pit&#13;
methods. In France, Greece, Turkey and Hungary, bauxite is also produced at&#13;
underground mines. Bauxite mining consists basically of three stages:&#13;
extraction, crushing and drying; some bauxites also require beneficiation.&#13;
Extraction involves removal of the overburden by bulldozers, drag-lines and&#13;
large-wheel excavators, with the use of explosives for hard terrains. Then,&#13;
the bauxite is removed by similar methods, and the overburden is replaced to&#13;
restore the surface of the mines for re-use as forest or agricultural land.&#13;
Where beneficiation processes are used, they generally consist of wet&#13;
processes to increase the alumina content and to reduce silica and iron&#13;
content.&#13;
Most bauxites require crttshiig for ease of processing. Caribbean&#13;
bauxite (Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Rcpublic) is so fine-grained that it needs&#13;
little or no crushing.&#13;
The third stage is drying, which may be done at the mine site or at&#13;
the refinery. If the bauxite is to be shipped great distances, it is usually&#13;
dried at the mine in order to reduce transport costs. Drying is carried out&#13;
in rotating kilns at moderate temperatures to remove the free moisture without&#13;
affecting the alumina hydrate. In this process, moisture is reduced by about&#13;
5 percent arriving at moisture contents of 10 percent for Caribbean bauxites&#13;
and of 5 percent for other types. The fine grain of Caribbean bauxite makes&#13;
it impractical to reduce humidity by more, since it would cause handling&#13;
difficulties. If the alumina plant is near the mine, the bauxite is dried at&#13;
the former, where the use of heat recovered from the refining process cuts&#13;
drying costs by about fifty percent. Mines in the Dominican Republic and&#13;
Northern Australia (Gove, Weipa) use solar drying and therefore do not require&#13;
drying fuel. Several of the Australian mines use a beneficiation process to&#13;
reduce silica content.&#13;
2.3 Alumina Refining&#13;
Bauxite is refined into alumina almost exclusively by the Bayer&#13;
process. Alternative technologies are available for obtaining alumina from&#13;
non-bauxite sources, but as mentioned previously in this section, processing&#13;
costs are significantly higher. Such is the case of the leaching and&#13;
sintering method employed in the Soviet Union to treat nepheline syenite and&#13;
alunite ores. Because of high costs, neither the USSR nor other countries&#13;
have any current plans for building new plants of this type. Since the Bayer&#13;
technology is likely to remain the most important for alumina refining in the&#13;
foreseeable future, this section focuses on its main technical aspects.&#13;
Bayer alumina plants consist of two facilities operating in series:&#13;
a hydrate plant and a calcination plant. The hydrate plant transforms bauxite&#13;
into alumina hydrate in a process involving four major operations:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
i.   Grinding and slurrying where the crushed ore is fed to&#13;
ball or rod mills and caustic soda, lime, hot water and&#13;
spent liquor are added to it, forming a slurry that goes&#13;
into the digestors. The consumption of caustic soda&#13;
depends principally on the reactive silica content and&#13;
mud washing losses, with an average of 1.4 kilograms of&#13;
soda (as NaOH) per kilogram or reactive silica. 1/ Lime&#13;
is used to reduce carbonates, regenerate caustic soda and&#13;
control phosphates. About 0.1 metric tons of lime per&#13;
metric ton of alutmina are assumed normal for a plant&#13;
using caustic soda and for a bauxite having minimum&#13;
phosphorus.&#13;
ii.    Digestion of the slurry containing bauxite and caustic&#13;
soda at elevated temperatures and pressure. At this&#13;
stage, bauxite is dissolved, forming a solution of sodium&#13;
aluminate (NaAlO2), while the reactive silica combines&#13;
with alumina forming a insoluble sodium aluminum silicate&#13;
and consuming caustic soda and alumina in the process.&#13;
Other insolubles include non-reactive silica, iron oxide&#13;
and titanium. The simplest digestors correspond to the&#13;
American Bayer process, characterized by a low temperature&#13;
digest (about 2900F) which is designed to extract easily&#13;
soluble gibbsite (Guyana, Brazil, Suriname, West Australia,&#13;
etc.), and which uses a relatively low caustic soda&#13;
concentration (up to about 130 grams per liter of Na2O).&#13;
At the other extreme is the European technology for&#13;
bauxites containing more difficult soluble boehmite&#13;
(monohydrate) which requires temperatures up to 490°F and&#13;
much higher caustic concentrations (up to 240 grams per&#13;
liter of Na2O).  This group of bauxites includes those&#13;
of southern Europe and Eastern Europe. Between the&#13;
extremes of these conditions, another technology exists&#13;
known as Modified American Bayer which is designed for&#13;
mixed bauxites containing principally gibbsite with&#13;
minor amounts of boehmite, as in North Australia, Guinea&#13;
and some deposits in Jamaica; for which process conditions are&#13;
set for temperatures from 3500 to 470°F and caustic&#13;
concentration up to about 150 grams per liter of Na2Q.&#13;
Operating conditions of the American Bayer process will&#13;
cause the solution of silica occurring only as a clay&#13;
impurity, while those of the European Bayer method will&#13;
also dissolve the silica contained in quartz.&#13;
1/ If, for example, a bauxite contains 2 percent reactive silica, to process&#13;
1 metric ton of bauxite will require 1.4  Kg Soda   x 20 Kg Silica&#13;
Kg Silica    ton bauxite&#13;
= 28 Kg of NaOH.  If the bauxite alumina ratio is 2.2 : 1, the soda&#13;
requirement per ton of alumina is 2.2 x 28 = 61.6 Kg.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
iii.    Filtration and settling of the insoluble impurities&#13;
(called red mud) separating them from the sodium aluminate&#13;
solution which in turn, is pumped into precipitators. The&#13;
red mud is usually discarded to disposal areas known as red&#13;
mud lakes.&#13;
iv.    Precipitation of the sodium aluminate which is seeded with&#13;
aluminum hydrate crystals, causing about 50-60 percent of&#13;
the alumina hydrate to dissociate from the soda and&#13;
precipitate out as crystals. The mixture is pumped to at&#13;
least 3 stages of thickeners which separate the crystals&#13;
from the caustic solution. The coarsest product is sent&#13;
to the calcination department; the product of the last 2&#13;
stages is recycled to the precipitators for seed to control&#13;
particle size. The caustic solution is recycled for further&#13;
use while the alumina hydrate is sent to the calciners.&#13;
The calcination of alumina hydrate (A1203 e 3H20 or A1203 . H20) to&#13;
alumina (A1203) involves the removal of moisture and of the chemically bonded&#13;
hydroxide by roasting the hydrate at 1,150 to 1,2500C. Before the 1950s&#13;
rotary kilns were used, but afterwards the industry has tended to employ fluid&#13;
bed calciners, which use 33 percent less fuel, are cheaper to install and&#13;
require less maintenance. In some of these calciners, final calcination&#13;
occurs in an updraft furnace into which both partially calcined hydrate and&#13;
fuel are injected; followed by a fluidized holding vessel where alumina can be&#13;
held for the required time at the desired calcination temperature. The&#13;
resulting alumina is then cooled in a fluid bed cooler and stockpiled until&#13;
shipped to aluminum smelters.&#13;
2.4 Aluminum Smelting&#13;
Aluminum metal is produced by the Hall-Heroult process which consists&#13;
of the electrolysis of alumina (A1203) to separate aluminum from oxygen. Two&#13;
types of reduction plants are currently in use: the prebaked anode plants and&#13;
the Soderberg anode plants. Given the importance of electricity as a major&#13;
input for these processes, and under the pressure of rising energy costs,&#13;
other routes are being tried, such as the ALCOA smelting process which&#13;
consists of the chlorination of alumina and the subsequent electrolysis of&#13;
aluminum chloride.   This process could reduce energy consumption by about 20&#13;
percent with respect to the Hall-Heroult process, but it brings other&#13;
complications such as the need to maintain the purity of aluminum chloride at&#13;
high levels. I1 If these and other difficulties are solved, this route for&#13;
aluminum production may be applied commercially by the end of the century.&#13;
An aluminum reduction plant consists of electrolytic cells arranged&#13;
in series (known as potlines), holding furnaces for the molten aluminum, and&#13;
casting machines for the production of ingots of different shapes. The cells&#13;
1/  Grjotheim, Kai and Barry Welch, "Impact of Alternative Processes for&#13;
Aluminum Production on Energy Requirements," in Gordon M. Bell (ed.) Light&#13;
Metals 1981, The Metallurigical Society of AIME, Pennsylvania, 1980.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
consist of an outer iron shell with inner carbon lining which serves as&#13;
cathode. The prebaked type anodes are blocks individually suspended by iron&#13;
rods hanging above the electrolytic cells. The Soderberg system uses green&#13;
carbon paste as anode material which is fed into the top of the anode&#13;
casing. 1/&#13;
In the Hall-Heroult process, the alumina is dissolved in molten&#13;
cryolite, which is a double fluoride of sodium and aluminum (Na3AlF6). By&#13;
electrolysis, at about 1000°C, aluminum is deposited at the cathode in the&#13;
form of a molten metal layer underneath the cryolite, while the oxygen&#13;
combines with the carbon at the anode forming a mixture of carbon dioxide and&#13;
carbon monoxide. The metallic aluminum is periodically tapped off and&#13;
transported to the holding furnaces which feed the casting machines.&#13;
Currently, with environmental concerns a major issue, special attention must&#13;
be paid to pollution problems at aluminum smelters. Significant expenditures&#13;
are required to control the fluorides resulting from the cell bath as well as&#13;
the alumina dust. Because of these problems, the use of Soderberg type anodes&#13;
is being discontinued, as they produce more abundant fluoride compounds and&#13;
tarry components.&#13;
Aluminum ingots of various shapes are shipped from the smelter to&#13;
semifabricating plants for further processing by a wide range of industries.&#13;
The special characteristics and relative low cost of aluminum account for its&#13;
varied applications. Some aluminum alloys combine lightness with great&#13;
strength. Aluminum does not corrode easily and is unaffected by many chemical&#13;
reactions. Although its conductivity is only 60 percent of that of copper,&#13;
due to its low density, an electric transmission line made of aluminum weighs&#13;
only 48 percent of an equivalent copper line. Due to these properties,&#13;
aluminum has replaced steel, copper, lead, zinc and tin in a wide range of&#13;
uses. Nevertheless, manufacturers of the competing metals and of other&#13;
products such as plastics, are constantly developing new alloys and composite&#13;
materials which halt and reverse substitution of aluminum in many fields. 2/&#13;
A breakdown of aluminum consumption by main uses is shown in Table&#13;
2. It should be noted that there may be definitional problems in breaking&#13;
down aluminum use, particularly in Western Europe. About one-fourth of&#13;
aluminum production is used for the transportation industry in motor&#13;
components, vehicle parts, electrical applications and paints. Near to 6&#13;
percent of aluminum metal is for machinery and equipment (mechanical&#13;
engineering). The electrical engineering and communications sector accounts&#13;
for one-tenth of aluminum consumption. About one-fourth of aluminum consumed&#13;
is used in building and construction, for doors and windows, heating and air&#13;
conditioning, structures and other uses. Resistance to corrosion has&#13;
permitted the replacement of steel and other materials by aluminum in&#13;
packaging and canning. Almost 7 percent of aluminum is employed for the&#13;
production of consumer durables, such as refrigerators, air conditioners,&#13;
washing machines and other appliances.&#13;

3. Data and Assumptions&#13;
In this section we shall describe the data and assumptions used in&#13;
the analysis. Following a section on demand, we discuss investment and&#13;
operating costs for mines, alumina refineries, and aluminum smelters. Given&#13;
their importance, energy costs are given special attention. Finally, the&#13;
available information on international transport costs, levies, taxes and&#13;
import duties is presented.&#13;
It should be emphasized once more that the information in this&#13;
section represents a first attempt at establishing a data base for worldwide&#13;
investment analysis. Although the present data incorporate numerous&#13;
recommendations for improvement, further qualitative improvements are&#13;
certainly desirable. Moreover, given the limited degree of disaggregation&#13;
that the analytic framework allows, many data categories are no more than&#13;
"stylized facts," fairly representative for groups of relatively comparable&#13;
countries, but in need of refinement for more detailed subsequent analysis.&#13;
3.1 Forecasting the Demand for Aluminum&#13;
The next two tables (3 and 4) provide a high and a low forecast of&#13;
the demand for aluminum, for eighteen regions in which we have divided the&#13;
world. The countries included in each region are given in Table 5.&#13;
Basically, the forecast was made on the basis of demand equations that relate&#13;
the demand for aluminum to either industrial production or Gross Domestic&#13;
Product, and the price of aluminum deflated by a price index. More detailed&#13;
information on the forecasting methodology is available from the World&#13;
Bank. 1/&#13;
For the high case, primary aluminum consumption is expected to grow&#13;
by 4.8 percent per annum between 1980 and 2000, whereas in t1* low case the&#13;
growth rate is reduced to 3.7 percent. The overall results -re consistent&#13;
with estimates from other studies. Thus, "Aluminum Annual Review" 2/ expects&#13;
an annual growth rate of primary aluminum consumption (excluding Centrally&#13;
Planned Economies) of 3.6 percent for the period 1980 to 1988. Resources for&#13;
the Future, in "World Mineral Trends and U.S. Supply Problems," 3/ considers&#13;
World Consumption of Refined Aluminum (including secondary ingot) to be 46.2&#13;
million metric tons by the year 2000, compared with the projections shown here&#13;
for total consumption (primary and secondary aluminum) of 52.8 million metric&#13;
tons for the high case and 43.6 million metric tons for the low case.&#13;

The reader should be aware of the fact that both bauxite and alumina&#13;
have uses outside the aluminum sector. According to King and Perlman 1/ about&#13;
3 million metric tons of bauxite are allocated to non-aluminum uses. the main&#13;
producing countries of non-metal grade bauxite-mainly clacined bauxite--are&#13;
Guyana, Suriname, Australia and the United States. A breakdown of production&#13;
by country is shown in Table 6. The estimated growth rate of bauxite for non-&#13;
metal uses, derived from this same source is 5.1 percent per year.&#13;
About 12.6 percent of aluminum consumption in the Western World is&#13;
used for purposes other than aluminum production. 2/ This would amount to&#13;
about 2.3 million metric tons of non-metal alumina in 1980. Table 7 presents&#13;
an estimated production breakdown per region. Alumina for these other uses is&#13;
expected to grow at 3.5 percent per annum. 3/&#13;
3.2 Investment and Operating Costs for Bauxite&#13;
Investment costs for bauxite mines depend on the size of the mine,&#13;
the strip ratio, locational factors and infrastructure requirements. Table 8&#13;
presents a formula to estimate capital costs for mines as a function of these&#13;
factors. Table 9 shows an estimate of location factors for various regions,&#13;
taking into account variations in equipment and construction costs as well as&#13;
physical infrastructure. With the data from Tables 1, 8 and 9, we may&#13;
estimate that to open a mine of 4 million tons per year in Brazil, would cost&#13;
about US$70/metric ton of bauxite 4/ per year while a mine in Guinea with the&#13;
same capacity would cost only US$51/metric ton of bauxite per year due to the&#13;
lack of over-burden.&#13;
Mines in remote undeveloped locations require very heavy investments&#13;
in infrastructure which need to be spread out by developing large projects.&#13;
Thus, in the case of locations such as Los Pijiguajos in Venezuela, Cameroon,&#13;
Kalimantan in Indonesia, and Tougue/Dabola/Kindia in Guinea, a minimum mine&#13;
size of about 3 million metric tons per year would be required for a project&#13;
to be economical.&#13;
Estimates of operating costs for mines are given in Table 10.&#13;
Besides the factors mentioned above, these costs consider the type of deposit,&#13;
labor requirements and costs, and drying expenditures. Costs are given in&#13;
1980 US dollars per metric ton of bauxite excluding moisture content, and they&#13;
include drying. Australian mines do not consume fuel for drying., since as&#13;
mentioned before, they use solar drying. If bauxite is to be refined locally,&#13;
drying costs shown in the table should be reduced by 50 percent.&#13;

moisture.  All other bauxites are dried from 10% to 5% moisture.  Dominican Republic and Northern Australia (Gove/Weipa) use solar drying and therefore do not use drying fuel.  Note that if&#13;
bauxite is processed at a local refinery it is not dried at the mine but the moisture is evaporated at the refinery at about 50% savings.&#13;

The data from Tables 8 to 10, together with transportation costs and&#13;
bauxite levies (the last two are detailed in sub-sections 3.5 and 3.6), are&#13;
used to estimate total production costs for bauxite, which are presented in&#13;
Table 11. This table shows that capital costs and levies are as important as&#13;
operating costs. Inland transportation costs are also significant in a number&#13;
of countries. Since Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Suriname&#13;
credit the levy against income taxes, its impact is greatly reduced if bauxite&#13;
is processed locally. This effect is shown in the last row of Table 11.&#13;
The figures on bauxite production costs from Table 11 must be used&#13;
together with information on bauxite quality and ocean transport costs to the&#13;
refineries in order to make comparisons on the convenience of using a&#13;
particular bauxite. This comparison is made in the sub-section on alumina&#13;
refining for selected bauxites and locations.&#13;
3.3 Investment and Operating Costs for Alumina&#13;
Capital costs for alumina refineries vary according to the type of&#13;
process required, to the location and to the plant dimensions. Table 12 shows&#13;
a formula to determine approximate investment costs taking these factors into&#13;
account. Thus, an American Bayer type refinery of one million metric tons per&#13;
year capacity, located in the United States, would cost US$1,050 per ton of&#13;
alumina; while if capacity doubles it would cost US$890 per ton. A Modified&#13;
American Bayer type refinery in Jamaica would cost US$1,220 per ton for a 1&#13;
million ton capacity, and US$1,030 per ton for a plant twice that size.&#13;
Differences in capital costs between regions and processes may go as high as&#13;
US$340 per metric ton (not considering the soda-sinter process) equivalent to&#13;
about US$40 in annualized terms.&#13;
The main inputs for alumina refining are, as pointed out previously,&#13;
bauxite, caustic soda (NaOH), lime (CaO), energy, labor, and other inputs&#13;
(including filter aid, floculants and chemicals). These inputs have been&#13;
quantified in Table 14 for different bauxites according to the refining&#13;
process required, as well as to the quality of the bauxite. For simplicity,&#13;
representative averages for bauxite/alumina ratios and silica content have&#13;
been taken over groups of countries. These averages represent only in an&#13;
approximate way specific bauxite deposits in each country, as may be compared&#13;
with original data shown in Table 1. Besides differences in bauxite&#13;
requirements and caustic soda consumption, energy consumption also varies,&#13;
being somewhat higher for the Modified American Bayer and European Bayer&#13;
processes. The soda sinter process which includes a Bayer plant plus&#13;
additional sintering stages consumes considerable energy. Labor inputs are&#13;
also somewhat higher for the Modified American and European Bayer processes,&#13;
and significantly higher for the soda-sinter process.&#13;
The prices of inputs for alumina refining excluding labor are shown&#13;
in Table 15. Estimates of labor costs for various countries are given in&#13;
Table 16. Tables 14 to 16, together with the capital cost estimates, and with&#13;
data on bauxite costs from the previous section permit us to compute some&#13;
representative alumina refining costs for new plants which are shown in Table&#13;
17. It may be appreciated that alumina refining is capital intensive with&#13;
capital charges representing about 33 percent of alumina costs. Because of&#13;

this, and given the existence of significant economies of scale in alumina&#13;
refining , considerable attention is paid by aluminum companies to the size of&#13;
the plant. This may be illustrated by the fact that operating a one million&#13;
ton per year plant would cost, because of higher capital charges, about 6&#13;
percent more per ton of alumina, than operating a two million ton plant.&#13;
Bauxite constitutes another major component of alumina costs, of&#13;
which it accounts for 26 to 28 percent. The cost of delivered bauxite&#13;
includes ocean transport costs and the bauxite levy. Thus, ocean transport&#13;
costs as a percentage of bauxite delivered at the East Coast of the United&#13;
States, represents 20 percent for Jamaican bauxite, 32 percent for Brazilian&#13;
bauxite and 34 percent for Guinean bauxite. For bauxite delivered in Western&#13;
Europe these figures are 30 percent for Greek bauxite, 28 percent for Guinean&#13;
bauxite and 65 percent for Australian bauxite. Some conclusions may be&#13;
derived from these figures. First, the cost of the levy for bauxite coming&#13;
from countries such as Jamaica and Guinea may be somewhat compensated with&#13;
lower shipment costs of these bauxites to main industrial countries. Second,&#13;
if alumina is processed locally in the bauxite producing countries,&#13;
significant savings in transportation may arise, thus making producers which&#13;
are far from the main markets more competitive, as in the case of Australia.&#13;
Among the other inputs for alumina refining, energy, caustic soda and&#13;
labor are important. Energy represents about 18 percent of costs, while&#13;
caustic soda and labor account each for 3-6 percent of the cost of producing&#13;
alumina.&#13;
3.4 Investment and Operating Costs for Aluminum, Including Energy Costs.&#13;
As with any industrial plant, unit capital costs for aluminum&#13;
smelters diminish with increasing plant size. However, savings due to&#13;
economies of scale are relatively small since large plants differ from smaller&#13;
ones mainly in the number of potlines arranged in series. Table 18 shows&#13;
estimates of capital costs of smelters, where economies of scale are achieved&#13;
only up to 200 thousand metric tons per year of aluminum. From this table we&#13;
can calculate that in an industrial country a one hundred thousand metric tons&#13;
per year smelter would cost US$3,400/metric ton, while a 200 thousand tons per&#13;
year smelter would cost US$2,900/metric ton. Similarly, for a remote location&#13;
in a developing country, these figures would be about US$4,100/metric ton for&#13;
a 100 thousand ton per year plant and US$3,600/metric ton for a plant twice&#13;
that size. Infrastructure factors for smelters are shown in Table 13.&#13;
Main inputs for aluminum smelting, besides capital charges, consist&#13;
of alumina, power, coke and pitch (anodes), labor and fluorides. Table 19&#13;
shows a quantification of these inputs. Electricity inputs are taken at&#13;
13,500 kwh per metric ton of aluminum for new plants in 1980 with productivity&#13;

improvements of 0.5 percent per year until a lower limit of 12,600 kwh/mt is&#13;
reached. 1/ The other inputs have been obtained from various sources, most&#13;
ofwhich are in agreement with each other. Input costs excluding wages and&#13;
electricity are shown in Table 20. The prices of petroleum coke and thermal&#13;
energy are estimated to increase by 3.2 percent per year in real terms, i.e.,&#13;
at the same rate estimated by the World Bank for oil prices. With respect to&#13;
wage rates, the same data as for alumina refining may be used (see Table&#13;
17). Estimates of electric power costs per region are shown in Table 21.&#13;
Power costs for new projects vary from figures as low as 6 mils/kwh for&#13;
specific projects to 20 mils/kwh for high head hydropower or flared gas and to&#13;
30 mils/kwh for low head hydropower. 2/ Coal and nuclear energy are&#13;
considered at a higher cost, i.e., 50 mils/kwh, except for Australia which&#13;
processes coal deposits near the power generating plants.&#13;
Since aluminum is highly intensive in electrical energy, aluminum&#13;
producers require low cost sources for power. As shown above, hydroelectric&#13;
power and flared gas offer the best possibilities for cheap power&#13;
generation. Table 22 shows the world's undeveloped energy resources of hydro-&#13;
power and flared gas together with estimates and coal reserves for&#13;
Australia. Part of these resources could be used as the sources of&#13;
electricity for new aluminum smelters. As an illustration of the amount of&#13;
low cost power that could be made available for new smelters, Table 23 shows&#13;
potential electricity supplies for aluminum smelting if 10 percent of&#13;
hydropower and 25 percent of flared gas are destined for this purpose. Since&#13;
coal is an exhaustible resource, in the case of Australia (Oceania) only&#13;
15,000 gigawatt hours per year generated from coal are considered for&#13;
smelting. Table 23 also presents, in the first column, the quantity of&#13;
current low cost electricity currently used for aluminum smelting.&#13;
With the above data, estimates for aluminum production costs at&#13;
selected locations have been prepared, and are shown in Table 24. Aluminum&#13;
costs from new projects range from a low US$0.79/pound for Australia to&#13;
US$0.98/pound for the United States. Alumina, electric power and capital&#13;
costs are the most important cost elements in aluminum smelting. Alumina&#13;
accounts for 30 percent of aluminum costs, electricity varies from 16 to 30&#13;
percent of costs, and capital charges represent from 16 to 35 percent.&#13;
Differences in these three cost items are significant among regions but those&#13;
of power costs are by far the most variable. As it may be appreciated from&#13;
Table 24, low cost electric power is therefore the main determinant for the&#13;
economic viability of an aluminum smelter.&#13;
1/ See Anthony Bird Associates, "Aluminum Annual Review, February 1981" for&#13;
productivity estimates. The lower limit of 12,600 kwh/mt has been quoted&#13;
by experts in the field. The estimate is based upon continued marginal&#13;
improvements in the efficiency of the basic process, and does not assume a&#13;
major technological breakthrough.&#13;

power plant is about US$1600/kw; considering a real rate of return of 10-&#13;
15% and dividing by 7000 kwh/kw the capital cost component of coal&#13;
generated power would be in the range of US$0.02/kwh to US$0.03/kwh. If&#13;
we add the cost of coal we obtain a total cost range of US$0.03/kwh -&#13;
0.06/kwh depending on coal mining costs, quality and transport cost.&#13;

the equivalent of not more than 15,000 gigawatt hours per year.&#13;

3.5 Transport Costs&#13;
Although mine and plant costs are an important component of total&#13;
costs of producing aluminum, there are also other significant factors. These&#13;
other factors are related to location both in a geographical sense as well as&#13;
with respect to the policies of each country being considered. We shall&#13;
discuss transport costs first.&#13;
Transport costs for bauxite associated with any given mining site may&#13;
constitute an important factor in investment decisions. If a deposit is&#13;
located far from a refinery/smelter complex, the delivered cost of bauxite or&#13;
alumina may be too high with respect to alternative sources. Since land&#13;
transportation costs for short routes may be as costly as ocean transportation&#13;
for distances one hundred times as great, this component needs to be taken&#13;
into consideration when estimating shipment costs. Therefore, this section&#13;
considers both inland transport costs as well as ocean shipment costs.&#13;
Bauxite deposits are frequently located inland, in isolated areas,&#13;
requiring long hauls to refineries and/or to ports. When their location is&#13;
remote and there are little or no facilities in the area, there will usually&#13;
be a preference to build the alumina refinery adjacent to a port or a city,&#13;
even if these are far away from the deposits. This permits the companies to&#13;
attract and maintain qualified personnel and to reduce social infrastructure&#13;
expenditures. Therefore, in many cases bauxite and not alumina is transported&#13;
from inland locations to seaports for its shipment overseas, or for its&#13;
processing into alumina to a refinery located near the port.&#13;
For inland transportation, shipments by river are preferred if the&#13;
geographic conditions are adequate and the rivers are navigable. Railroad&#13;
transportation is used for long hauls if rivers are not available, while belt&#13;
conveyors are economic over short to medium distances. When shipments are&#13;
small, deposits are scattered and distances involved are relatively short,&#13;
road transportation is used. In Table 25, the means of inland transportation&#13;
currently used from bauxite mines to refineries and ports as well as average&#13;
distances, are reported. This table, together with Table 26, which presents&#13;
estimated unit transport costs, permits the computation of inland&#13;
transportation costs. An analysis of these data shows that for countries such&#13;
as Jamaica or Northern Australia, inland transport costs are only about US$1&#13;
per ton of bauxite whereas for countries such as Brazil and Guinea, where the&#13;
deposits are away from the coast, these figures may be as high as US$5 per ton&#13;
of bauxite. An extreme case is Cameroon, where if its bauxite deposits were&#13;
developed, it would require about US$17 to transport one ton of bauxite to the&#13;
coast.&#13;
In analyzing ocean shipment costs, one must consider that bauxite and&#13;
alumina are traded internationally in much higher volumes than aluminum,&#13;
although in recent years, an increasing number of smelters have been built&#13;
outside the main consuming countries. Exports of bauxite in 1978 amounted to&#13;
about 36 million tons, of which 27 million tons originated in developing&#13;
countries. Meanwhile, alumina exports, for the same year, were 12 million&#13;
tons, with about fifty percent coming from developing countries. Participation&#13;
of developing countries in aluminum exports was less significant with 0.5&#13;
million tons from these countries out of a world total of 4 million tons.&#13;

Thus, these figures suggest not only a lower volume of exports for the more&#13;
processed products but also a declining participation of developing countries&#13;
as the value added to these products' increases. Whether this tendency may be&#13;
reversed depends, at least in part, on economic considerations as will be&#13;
analyzed later in this study.&#13;
Ocean transport costs, as mentioned before, are an important element&#13;
affecting bauxite and alumina prices as well as those of aluminum. Apart from&#13;
market factors, the level of freight charges depends on shipment distances,&#13;
vessel size, and the type of transport arrangements.&#13;
The size of the vessel exerts considerable influence on shipping&#13;
costs. Operating costs per unit for a 110 thousand tonnes bulk carrier are&#13;
about 39 percent of unit costs for a 15 thousand tonnes carrier and about 53&#13;
percent of those for a 25 thousand tonnes carrier. 1/ Therefore,&#13;
international trade of bauxite and alumina generally takes place in as large&#13;
vessels as possible in order to minimize freight rates.&#13;
Bauxite carriers are medium sized ships of 20,000-40,000 DWT (Dead&#13;
Weight Tonnes) employed in cross Caribbean routes and where port capacity is a&#13;
limitation. OBO (bulk) carriers, which range from 40,000-80,000 DWT, are&#13;
employed on longer routes, as from Australia to Europe or to the U.S., subject&#13;
to port capacity. Table 27 shows representative freight rates, based on&#13;
operating costs, of shipping bauxite in a bauxite carrier of 25,000 DWT as&#13;
compared to an OBO carrier of 60,000 DWT. Annex 1 shows distances between&#13;
ports which may be used together with Table 27 to estimate freight rates for&#13;
particular routes. As shown in Table 17 of the previous sub-section, to&#13;
transport one ton of bauxite from Australia (Weipa) to Western Europe&#13;
(Rotterdam) in an OBO carrier would cost US$29 per metric ton, while to&#13;
transport it in a bauxite carrier would cost US$42 per metric ton, thus making&#13;
Australian bauxite much more expensive. By contrast, to transport Jamaican&#13;
bauxite to the East Cost of the United States would cost US$7.50/metric ton in&#13;
a bauxite carrier and US$6/metric ton in an OBO carrier.&#13;
Bulk materials, such as bauxite and alumina can be handled more&#13;
cheaply than aluminum and its fabricated products. Table 27 shows typical&#13;
freight rates for aluminum, which are 3 to 4 times as high as those for&#13;
bauxite/alumina. This has to do not only with handling but also with the&#13;
relatively small volume shipped and because of this, to the type of shipping&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
Since, as mentioned, the dimensions of the vessel affect the cost of&#13;
shipping bauxite and alumina, it is important to consider port capabilities as&#13;
these determine the maximum vessel size allowed. This is shown in Table 28,&#13;
which gives the maximum size of ships permitted at main ports employed by&#13;
mines, refineries and smelters throughout the world.&#13;

3.6 Taxation Policies of Bauxite Producing Countries&#13;
Many bauxite producing countries rely heavily on their aluminum&#13;
industry as a source of government income. This can be illustrated by&#13;
analyzing government revenues from the bauxite sector as a percentage of total&#13;
government income. This percentage varies across countries from more than 35&#13;
percent for Suriname and Guinea, to between 10 and 35 percent for Jamaica,&#13;
Guyana and Haiti, and to less than 10 percent for Australia, Yugoslavia,&#13;
Dominican Republic, Ghana, Indonesia and Sierra Leone. The taxation system&#13;
among these countries varies widely. Taxes imposed on bauxite producers can&#13;
be classified into five categories: production levies, export taxes,&#13;
corporate income taxes, royalties and equity participation. This diversity of&#13;
taxation systems is summarized in Table 29 for major bauxite producing&#13;
countries..&#13;
Production levies were initiated by Jamaica in 1974 as a means of&#13;
increasing government revenues in foreign currency at a time when its economy&#13;
was hit hard by the energy crisis. Other Caribbean bauxite producers followed&#13;
this move--Suriname, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Encouraged by this&#13;
action, Guinea chose to impose a levy on bauxite and alumina exports. In&#13;
Jamaica, the immediate effect of the levy was to increase government revenues&#13;
from this sector from 40 million US dollars in 1973 (8 percent of government&#13;
revenues) to about 130 million US dollars in 1976 (37 percent of government&#13;
revenues). A negative effect of the levy and other measures taken at the time&#13;
was to discourage bauxite production, which decreased from 13.6 million tons&#13;
in 1973 to 10.3 million tons in 1976. In order to reverse this trend, the&#13;
levy which had been initially set at 7.5 percent of the aluminum price (per&#13;
ton of aluminum content), was reduced in July 1979 to a levy which for current&#13;
production ranges from 6.8 percent to below 6 percent, varying with the price&#13;
of aluminum, and which for additional production drops below 3 percent.&#13;
It is convenient to convert the production levy from a percentage of&#13;
the aluminum price to a dollar value per ton of bauxite; for this the&#13;
following formula may be used:&#13;
Levy (US$/mt)   B-  itey /Alue i%)/u  tio  x Aluminum Price (US$/mt)&#13;
So, for example, for a levy rate of 5.5 percent, a bauxite/aluminum ratio of&#13;
4.8, and an aluminum price of US$1,670/metric ton, the levy would be:&#13;
54.5/8° x 1,670 = US$19/mt bauxite&#13;

The Caribbean countries (Jamaica, Suriname, Haiti and the Dominican&#13;
Republic) allow the companies to subtract income taxes from the levy. The&#13;
theoretical levy--before substracting income tax--is called "gross levy." The&#13;
actual paid levy--after deducting income tax--is called "net levy." This&#13;
scheme, as opposed to one where only a gross levy and no income tax were to be&#13;
paid, permits foreign firms to credit income tax paid in the host country&#13;
against income tax to be paid in its home country, thus reducing the real cost&#13;
of the levy.&#13;
Guinea, which imposes an export levy on bauxite and alumina, does not&#13;
credit income tax against the levy, therefore the total levy represents an&#13;
additional cost for the producer. The levy applied by Guinea is also&#13;
estimated as a function of the aluminum price but is paid per ton of&#13;
bauxite. To allow for different aluminum contents of the bauxite, this levy&#13;
varies according to the bauxite-alumina ratio (see Table 29).&#13;
Another tax applied to the bauxite sector takes the form of a&#13;
royalty. This is similar to the levy, except that it is viewed as a payment&#13;
for the privilege of exploiting the mineral resources of a country. Royalties&#13;
are usually not a very significant component of bauxite costs, amounting in&#13;
most cases to less than US$1 per ton of bauxite.&#13;
Corporate income taxes are applied by most countries on the&#13;
bauxite/aluminum industry, although as mentioned above, Caribbean countries&#13;
allow the companies to credit them against the levy. Among the main bauxite&#13;
producing countries, Brazil and Australia rely basically on this fiscal&#13;
instrument for generating government revenues. The main attraction for&#13;
companies with respect to this system is that during the first years of a&#13;
project, they generate little or no profits and therefore they do not have to&#13;
pay income tax. By the same token, host countries which are highly pressed&#13;
for revenues may consider this is a drawback.&#13;
Another method of generating government revenues is through equity&#13;
participation. In many cases this participation arises in recognition of&#13;
expenditures made by the government in building needed infrastructure. A&#13;
different situation occurs in countries as Guyana, wich have expropriated the&#13;
bauxite sector.&#13;
An attempt is made in the remainder of this section to compare the&#13;
cost of the levy after subtracting income tax credits. In order to accomplish&#13;
this, some assumptions need to be made. First, every year must be considered&#13;
a normal year with average profits. Second, it must be assumed that if a&#13;
company is only subject to income tax it would report a normal transaction&#13;
price (including normal profits). Third, it is considered that the company&#13;
already possesses some plants in the host country, and therefore, any taxes&#13;
generated in those plants may be credited against the levy on bauxite from new&#13;
projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
Table 30 presents estimates of income taxes to be paid on a new&#13;
project using a real rate of return of 10 percent on investment and 50 percent&#13;
corporate tax on profits. The gross and net levies computed on the basis of&#13;
these assumptions, are shown in Table 31 for companies operating only bauxite&#13;
mines, and in Table 32 for companies operating a bauxite alumina integrated&#13;
complex in the host country. Although the effect of crediting income tax&#13;
against the levy is not very significant if only mines are developed, it seems&#13;
to be very important if an integrated mine and refinery complex are built.&#13;
Thus, in Table 32 it is shown that for an integrated operation the net levy is&#13;
about one half of the gross levy, and that for a new project in Jamaica, it&#13;
could all be credited against income tax. Besides, for a country with&#13;
potential hydroelectric power, as in the case of Suriname, the possibility&#13;
exists of building additional smelter capacity. In such a case the estimated&#13;
income tax for the integrated operation would be higher than the gross levy,&#13;
and therefore, the effect of the latter would be nil.&#13;
3.7 Import Tariffs on Bauxite, Alumina and Aluminum&#13;
In order to protect local industry, most countries restrict aluminum&#13;
imports by imposing tariffs. Some of these countries extend this protection&#13;
against bauxite and alumina imports. Tables 33 and 34 show import duties for&#13;
bauxite/alumina and aluminum, respectively, expressed in ad-valorem terms.&#13;
One may appreciate that tariffs are generally higher for aluminum ingot in&#13;
order to promote processing in the aluminum consuming country. Of the major&#13;
aluminum consumers, only Western Europe protects also its alumina refineries.&#13;
The possible effects of these protective measures are reflected in&#13;
the delivered cost of aluminum as shown in Table 35 for major countries.&#13;
These figures are for new projects, and they show that with tariffs at the&#13;
present level, it would not be competitive for a company to build an aluminum&#13;
smelter in the major industrial countries. This does not rule out the&#13;
protection of already existing smelters, which have long-term contracts for&#13;
cheap electricity supplies, and for which capital investments were lower than&#13;
those currently required to build a new smelter.&#13;

4. Framework of Analysis&#13;
4.1 Problem Formulation&#13;
The preceding sections provide the background for the main question&#13;
being addressed in this study: to what extent will changes in the cost and&#13;
availability of inputs for the aluminum industry affect the future investment,&#13;
production and trading patterns for products in the industry.&#13;
The depletion of low cost bauxite mines in industrial countries has&#13;
forced the industry to exploit new deposits in less developed areas. 1/&#13;
Selection of deposits to be mined depends on mining costs, ore quality,&#13;
transportation and taxation. The development of new mines in remote&#13;
unexploited locations requires, in most cases, heavy investments in physical&#13;
and social infrastructure which, due to their lumpiness, require the opening&#13;
of large mines to reduce unit investment costs. In order to compare mining&#13;
costs among deposits, the type and quality of the ore needs to be considered&#13;
since their treatment at refineries varies considerably. As both inland and&#13;
ocean transport constitute a significant portion of bauxite costs, and typical&#13;
shipment costs may represent from 10 to over 50 percent of the delivered cost&#13;
of bauxite, such costs are another important factor to be taken into&#13;
account. So is taxation, in particular bauxite production levies which have&#13;
been imposed by a number of countries, 2/ and which may increase substantially&#13;
the cost of bauxite.&#13;
Alumina refineries experience significant economies of scale up to&#13;
about two million metric tons per year of output. The investment cost per&#13;
unit volume for a two million metric ton refinery is approximately 15 percent&#13;
lower than for a one million metric ton plant. As mentioned above, the type&#13;
of bauxite to be processed also influences the cost of production alumina.&#13;
Variations in equipment and operating conditions may account for differences&#13;
in production costs of up to 20 percent. Plant location is another main&#13;
factor in determining alumina costs. Less developed regions require higher&#13;
investments costs due to imported components and infrastructure&#13;
requirements. Nevertheless, locating a refinery in a less developed bauxite&#13;
producing country may result in savings in transportation costs, since freight&#13;
rates per ton for bauxite and alumina are similar but the latter has a higher&#13;
aluminum content. Thus, there are trade-offs that need to be considered and&#13;
refineries may be built near mine sites or close to aluminum smelters.&#13;

Industry, in Proceedings of Bauxite Symposium IV, 1980, the Journal of the&#13;

The main cost components at aluminum smelters are capital, alumina&#13;
and electric power. Capital costs at a smelter are high, representing from 20&#13;
to 30 percent of aluminum production costs; economies of scale in investment&#13;
are significant only to about 200 thousand metric tons per year of aluminum.&#13;
Alumina costs represent another 25 percent of total costs differing from plant&#13;
to plant according to their sources of supply and to transportation costs. As&#13;
mentioned in the previous section, the availability of low cost electricity is&#13;
a main determinant for the location of a smelter. Due to rising power costs&#13;
in industrial countries, the tendency is to search for those areas where the&#13;
opportunity cost of energy is relatively low, e.g, abundant hydropower&#13;
potential, flared gas or cheap coal. In order to countervail this trend and&#13;
to protect local smelters, many countries may be tempted to increase tariffs&#13;
on imported aluminum. Therefore, the viability of new smelters at particular&#13;
locations depends not only on low-cost resources, but also on future&#13;
international trade policies.&#13;
While bauxite mines, alumina refineries and aluminum smelters all&#13;
exhibit economies of scale up to a given plant size, one can not assume that&#13;
the investment cost function for new plants is independent of the total amount&#13;
of capacity installed. Assuming cost-minimizing behavior in terms of site&#13;
selection, the most attractive sites will be selected first, so that&#13;
subsequent plants will tend to be higher-cost. As additional plants are&#13;
built, greater demands will be placed upon infrastructure requirements, and&#13;
the risk premium in investment capital costs may increase. It is for this&#13;
reason that our capital cost estimates include a factor that increases capital&#13;
cost for a range of relevant plant sizes dependent upon the number of plants&#13;
to be built in a given producing region.&#13;
There are, therefore, a large number of factors to be considered to&#13;
determine the least-cost supply pattern to meet future demand for aluminum.&#13;
Moreover, many of the factors mentioned cannot be projected into the future&#13;
with great accuracy, and at best, a range of quantitative values can be placed&#13;
upon them. Extensive sensitivity analysis was therefore carried out, focusing&#13;
on high and low demand estimates for aluminum, electricity prices and&#13;
supplies, capital costs, and trade policies.&#13;
It should be emphasized that our results relate to a representation&#13;
of the industry that covers bauxite, alumina and aluminum smelting, and&#13;
therefore does not extend to the production of semi-finished and finished&#13;
aluminum. The framework of analysis could be extended to include these&#13;
further processing steps, which, indeed, may be important for certain uses of&#13;
the analysis.&#13;
4.2 A Model of the Aluminum Sector&#13;
The model we have used is formulated in terms of a mixed-integer&#13;
programming problem, a variant of linear programming, which permits the&#13;
capture of economies of scale. Given a set of assumptions regarding the&#13;
exogenous variables, the model yields the least-cost pattern of investment,&#13;
production and trade for meeting aluminum demand in the world during the&#13;
planning period. The data and assumptions used were described in the previous&#13;
subsection; they are given in computer-readable form in Annex 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
We realize that cost minimization may not be the sole objective of&#13;
aluminum corporations, and the other goals such as market diversification and&#13;
the minimization of risk, as well as institutional constraints in host&#13;
countries should be considered as well. As such factors are difficult to&#13;
quantify, however, we have dealt with them only to the extent that we carried&#13;
out sensitivity analysis to determine the cost of other than least-cost&#13;
strategies.&#13;
Schematically, the model can be described as follows:&#13;
Minimize total costs (investment, operating and transport costs,&#13;
with or without levies and tarriffs) such that&#13;
o  Market demand is satisfied in each region;&#13;
o  Input and output flows for bauxite, alumina and&#13;
aluminum are consistent with each other;&#13;
o  Bauxite may be produced at each region subject&#13;
to reserves availability;&#13;
o  Aluminum smelters have access to limited low&#13;
cost electricity in some regions, but high&#13;
cost power is unlimited;&#13;
o  Production at each region is limited by existing&#13;
capacity, but this capacity may be expanded at a&#13;
cost by new investments.&#13;
A mathematical statement of the model is given in Annex 2.&#13;
4.3 Uses and Limitations&#13;
The primary use of the analytic framework presented in this paper is&#13;
to determine to what extent the increase in the price of energy during the&#13;
seventies has shifted the comparative advantage for aluminum smelting from&#13;
energy-importing countries to those that have access to relatively abundant&#13;
non-tradeable hydro-power. As the answer to this question is not&#13;
straightforward, and depends upon a large number of factors besides relative&#13;
energy cost, such as investment cost, access to high-quality bauxite, and&#13;
proximity to markets, a model was required that can capture the most important&#13;
interdependencies.&#13;
Even for a simplified representation of reality, an enormous amount&#13;
of data, assumptions and forecasts is needed. These data requirements are not&#13;
unique to our approach, and would be identical to any other systematic method&#13;
of analysis addressed to the same sorts of questions. The model we have used&#13;
provides an efficient framework for the organization of the data, assumptions&#13;
and forecasts, as illustrated in Annex 1. Any further improvements in the&#13;
empirical base for our analysis can easily be incorporated into this&#13;
framework. The discipline imposed by our approach includes an explicit&#13;
documentation on any data used or assumptions and forecast made.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
A major use of the model lies in the facility offered to carry out&#13;
sensitivity analysis. Depending upon one's perspective or specific interest,&#13;
views of future events may vary, and it would be naive to assume that a single&#13;
base case can be formulated that represents a consensus view. Nevertheless,&#13;
many forecasts of industry patterns describe a single trajectory, often very&#13;
different, without providing the user an opportunity to determine the&#13;
implications of a varying set of assumptions. Our approach allows for this&#13;
possibility, although not without costs. In the results section, we describe&#13;
several such scenarios, focused on different assumptions regarding the cost&#13;
and availability of relatively cheap power, different levels of investment&#13;
costs, and different trade policies. Clearly, many more variants could be&#13;
formulated.&#13;
While our approach, therefore, has a number of important uses, there&#13;
are clear limitations that need to be spelled out. The need to limit data&#13;
requirements for empirical as well as computational reasons, and the&#13;
standardized form in which many data categories are available, places&#13;
limitations on the interpretation one can attach to the results. They are at&#13;
best indications of broad patterns of investment, production and trade, not&#13;
recommendations for specific investment opportunities in specific areas. This&#13;
is most obvious in the case of vaguely defined regions such as "Other Asia."&#13;
But it may also be valid for individual countries, where local conditions may&#13;
lead to a cost structure which is somewhat different from the standardized one&#13;
used in our analysis, and where one would need to ascertain that the&#13;
adjustments required would not affect the earlier results. As will be shown&#13;
in the next section, the sensitivity of the results varies for different&#13;
products in the industry, alumina being the most volatile.&#13;
A second limitation relates to product coverage. Our "final" good is&#13;
primary aluminum, and the efficiency of different investment patterns is&#13;
determined on the basis of forecast demand for this product. Conceivably, the&#13;
introduction of semi-processed products could have an impact on the optimal&#13;
location of smelters, although this is doubted by industry specialists, given&#13;
the relatively limited importance of transport costs in total delivered costs&#13;
of aluminum ingots.&#13;
A third limitation of our approach is methodological. While our&#13;
model can capture the impact of economies of scale on the sizing, location,&#13;
and timing of capacity expansion in the industry, it can not handle price-&#13;
elastic demand. While most demand studies for aluminum conclude that in the&#13;
long run the growth of demand is closely correlated with the growth of GNP or&#13;
industrial production, it should be borne in mind that in a number of uses&#13;
aluminum has close substitutes.&#13;
Finally, it should be stressed that although sensitivity analysis can&#13;
deal with small-event uncertainty, large-event uncertainty is relevant for the&#13;
industry. A technological breakthrough may drastically reduce energy&#13;
requirements for aluminum smelting. Or nuclear power may expand much faster&#13;
than implied in our forecasts. Such events would have a very major impact on&#13;
the results, and lead to the continued dominance of OECD countries in aluminum&#13;
smelting.&#13;

5.  Results&#13;
In the first two sub-sections, we shall describe the major results&#13;
achieved with the model when tariffs and levies are ignored. Given the&#13;
emphasis on actual resource costs, we call these results normative: assuming&#13;
our data, assumptions and projections to be correct, they describe the least-&#13;
cost supply pattern that would meet world demand for aluminum by the year&#13;
2000. In the last sub-section, the results will be described when tariffs and&#13;
levies are taken into account.&#13;
For purposes of investment analysis, it appears sensible to take as a&#13;
starting point a relatively pessimistic view of the future growth of demand&#13;
for aluminum, in correspondence with projections of low rates of growth of&#13;
gross domestic product in the main consuming regions between now and 2000. We&#13;
will refer to this assumption as the base case. Variants of the base run are:&#13;
A. High demand;&#13;
B. Higher investment costs in LDCs;&#13;
C. Electricity prices in Canada raised to US levels;&#13;
D. As in C but hydropower costs in LDCs increased as well;&#13;
E. No trade among the three blocks (OECD, LDCs, Eastern&#13;
Europe/USSR);&#13;
F. Limited trade among the three blocks.&#13;
The main results obtained for the base case and the variants are&#13;
described below.&#13;
5.1 The Base Case: Low Demand&#13;
The set of demand projections used for this version of the model was&#13;
given in Table 4 of Section 3. As is shown there, the total demand for&#13;
primary aluminum in the world will amount to 31.6 million tons by 2000. 1/&#13;
OECD countries account for 46 percent of this total, USSR/Eastern Europe for&#13;
13 percent, and all other countries (LDCs) for 41 percent.&#13;
To meet this demand, expansion of capacity is required, from 17 to 33&#13;
million tons, assuming on average 95 percent capacity utilization. Details on&#13;
the pattern of investment and capacity that we obtained in the analysis are&#13;
presented in Table 36 below.&#13;
1/ Scrap recoveries are projected to amount to 12 million tons by 2000.&#13;

The most striking feature revealed by the table is the sharp increase&#13;
in the share of productive capacity for all three stages in the production&#13;
process that could occur in the LDCs as a group. For bauxite mining, the&#13;
share would increase from a little less than 50 percent in 1980 to almost 70&#13;
percent of total capacity in 2000. More than 90 percent of all new bauxite&#13;
mine capacity would be installed in LDCs. In the case of alumina, 85 percent&#13;
of new capacity would be installed in LDCs, and, as a result, its share in&#13;
total capacity would increase from 20 percent in 1980 to just below 50 percent&#13;
in 2000. Similarly, for aluminum, total capacity in LDCs would grow from 15&#13;
percent in 1980 to 40 percent in 2000. Almost three-quarters of all new&#13;
capacity for aluminum smelting would in fact be installed in LDCs. On cost&#13;
grounds, therefore, it would appear that LDCs have gained a distinct cost&#13;
advantage over the more developed countries, and while they would certainly&#13;
not dominate the market by the year 2000, particularly for aluminum and&#13;
alumina, they could increase their share of total world output very&#13;
substantially. For LDCs as a group, the ample availability of good-quality&#13;
bauxite, in relatively accessible deposits, combined with access to&#13;
comparatively cheap hydro-power, appear to provide sufficient compensation for&#13;
higher investment costs and transport costs to markets, to set in motion a&#13;
major shift in supply patterns.&#13;

In the next table (Table 37), we provide results that relate to&#13;
capacity utilization. By assumption, effective capacity is assumed to equal&#13;
95 percent of nominal capacity to account for plant maintenance. Comparing&#13;
effective capacity to production, for the year 2000, we obtain estimates for&#13;
capacity utilization levels. It is interesting to note that for both alumina&#13;
and aluminum, capacity utilization levels come out very high for all&#13;
regions. Comparative costs in OECD countries may have moved in a direction&#13;
which makes new investments inefficient; however, they have not increased so&#13;
much that existing capacity is not utilized. In interpreting this result, it&#13;
should be stressed that capacity installed at the beginning of the planning&#13;
period is treated as sunk cost, so that for such productive capacity only&#13;
marginal costs are taken into account. Nevertheless, bauxite mining occurs&#13;
below full capacity, 72 percent for OECD as a group.&#13;

In Table 38, the destination of production is presented, including&#13;
sales of product for non-metal uses. LDCs are completely self-sufficient for&#13;
bauxite, while OECD is the major importer; by 2000 it would import over 40&#13;
percent of its requirements, mainly from LDCs. USSR/Eastern Europe would&#13;
import about one-fourth of its bauxite requirements by the year 2000, entirely&#13;
from LDCs. A little more than 80 percent of all alumina internationally&#13;
traded by 2000 would originate in LDCs, most of it destined for OECD&#13;
countries. Most interestingly, LDCs as a group could achieve a considerable&#13;
%                 a&#13;

degree of self-sufficiency for aluminum, supplying 5 out of 7 million tons of&#13;
market requirements. In fact, LDCs produce much more than their needs, 12&#13;
million tons, of which 5 million are exported to OECD countries, and over 1&#13;
million tons to USSR/Eastern Europe. OECD would import about one-fourth of&#13;
its total requirements, almost entirely from LDCs.&#13;

What additional insights are gained from the results at the next&#13;
level of aggregation, a 7 - region breakdown of the world: North America,&#13;
Western Europe, Japan and Oceania, South America and the Caribbean, Africa,&#13;
Asia, and USSR/Eastern Europe? The first three regions form OECD, the next&#13;
three are grouped into what was referred to as LDCs, and the last one remains&#13;
unchanged.&#13;
For bauxite, OECD's production capacity is expanded only in the&#13;
region "Japan/Oceania", which in this case means in Australia. 1/ Moreover,&#13;
capacity utilization in North America is only 41 percent by 2000, entirely for&#13;
non-metal uses. It is clearly more efficient to import most of North&#13;
1/ And this capacity expansion was firmly committed at the time of analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
America's bauxite requirements for alumina refining from South America and the&#13;
Caribbean.&#13;
Most of the expansion of mining capacity takes place in South America&#13;
and the Caribbean, slightly below 50 percent. In Africa, the share in total&#13;
new capacity is 15 percent, while Asia accounts for 25 percent.&#13;
Bauxite shipment patterns come out predictably. In addition to&#13;
meeting their own requirements of bauxite for alumina refining (and a&#13;
relatively minor amount for use outside the industry), South America and the&#13;
Caribbean supply North America, Africa supplies Western Europe, and&#13;
USSR/Eastern Europe and Asia supply Japan and Oceania, but to a much lesser&#13;
extent. Only 27 percent of all bauxite produced is traded among the seven&#13;
regions.&#13;
In the case of alumina, no new capacity is built in the Japan/Oceania&#13;
region or in USSR/Eastern Europe. Most of the new capacity is installed in&#13;
South America and the Caribbean, and in Asia.&#13;
Trade in alumina follows a similar pattern to that of bauxite.&#13;
However, Western Europe obtains its alumina requirements from South America&#13;
and the Caribbean rather than Africa, and the proportion of alumina produced&#13;
that is traded among the seven regions is even smaller: just over 20 percent.&#13;
Taking committed and new capacity together, production capacity&#13;
expansion for aluminum occurs in all regions. Capacity expansion in OECD&#13;
countries and in USSR/Eastern Europe is relatively small, with none in Western&#13;
Europe. South America and the Caribbean, with 25 percent of all new capacity,&#13;
Africa, with 15 percent, and Asia, with 23 percent, clearly dominate. During&#13;
the period 1980-2000, North America will see its share in total aluminum&#13;
production capacity drop from 34 percent to 24 percent, and Western Europe&#13;
from 22 to 13 percent, while Africa will see its share increase from 3 percent&#13;
to 8.5 percent. Similarly, Asia's share doubles, from slightly less than 7&#13;
percent to 14 percent, while South America and the Caribbean triples its share&#13;
from 5 to 15 percent.&#13;
Trading patterns for aluminum among the seven regions contain no&#13;
surprises. North America and Western Europe will retain a considerable degree&#13;
of self-sufficiency, and could supply over 70 percent of their own needs.&#13;
North America imports the deficit from South America and the Caribbean, and&#13;
from Oceania; Western Europe from Africa. The USSR/Eastern Europe region&#13;
would become fairly heavily dependent on imports, meeting only 50 percent of&#13;
its requirements from regional production.&#13;
Considering the results at the individual country level adds some&#13;
interesting detail to the aggregate results. Bauxite mining capacity expands&#13;
most rapidly in Jamaica where 30 million of just over 100 million tons of new&#13;
bauxite mining capacity will be opened up. By the year 2000, Jamaica would&#13;
have one-fifth of the world's bauxite mining capacity. The second largest&#13;
capacity expansion occurs in Indonesia (12 million), followed by Eastern&#13;
Europe and USSR (8 million), "Other Asia" (6.6 million) and Guinea (6&#13;
million). No new mines would be opened in countries such as Surinam, Sierra&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
Leone and Australia 1/; as will be described in the next section, this result&#13;
is clearly very sensitive to the neglect of all levies in this set of runs of&#13;
the model. More detail on bauxite capacity and production is given in Table&#13;
39.&#13;
Jamaica and China lead in new alumina refining capacity, in the&#13;
amount of 4 million tons each. As Table 40 shows, alumina refining capacity&#13;
is expanded in North America and Europe as well, but not in USSR/Eastern&#13;
Europe. 2/.&#13;
In the case of aluminum, at the individual country level, the largest&#13;
capacity expansion would take place in Brazil, 1.7 million tons, or 13 percent&#13;
of all new capacity to the extent it is not yet committed at this time (Table&#13;
41). As Guinea, Ghana, Zaire and North Africa are relatively attractive&#13;
locations for new smelter capacity, the share of Africa in total capacity&#13;
would increase from 3 percent to 9 percent of the world's total. In Latin&#13;
America, Brazil becomes the major producer of aluminum, with 2.4 million tons&#13;
of capacity, or almost 50 percent of total capacity in Latin America and the&#13;
Caribbean by 2000. Also, Venezuela could become a major producer, with a&#13;
capacity of 800,000 tons. A small smelter could be built in Guyana, but no&#13;
new capacity should be constructed in either Argentina or Suriname.&#13;
In Asia, one million tons of new smelter capacity could be&#13;
constructed in ASEAN (Indonesia), while in India and China (the Middle East)&#13;
smelter capacity of up to 800,000 tons could be constructed. Smaller capacity&#13;
expansion in China and "Other Asia" is possible. Over one million tons of new&#13;
capacity in USSR/Eastern Europe could be built, most of it in Eastern Europe.&#13;
In OECD, only North America (mainly Canada) and Oceania remain&#13;
attractive regions for new smelter capacity. No new capacity, over and above&#13;
already committed capacity expansion, should be located in Western Europe; in&#13;
Japan, capacity will be closed down.&#13;
Turning to the resulting trading patterns and starting once more with&#13;
bauxite, Table 42 shows that by far the largest individual trade flows occur&#13;
between Jamaica and North America, the latter importing more than 23 million&#13;
tons of bauxite. Western Europe imports bauxite primarily from Guinea, and&#13;
from Eastern Europe. Japan purchases bauxite from Indonesia and Northern&#13;
Australia; Indonesia has the potential of becoming a major exporter of bauxite&#13;
to other Asian countries, in spite of the fact that it expands its own alumina&#13;
and aluminum industry considerably.&#13;
I&#13;
1/ Except, in the case of Australia, for mining projects that presented firm&#13;
commitments at the beginning of the planning period.&#13;
2/ In most cases, new capacity installed is either 2 million or 6 million&#13;
tons. This is due to the assumption that economies of scale in alumina&#13;
production are exhausted at 2 million tons. Capital cost dominate&#13;
production cost of alumina to such an extent that one would normally&#13;
exploit economies of scale to the maximum. Moreover, diseconomies of&#13;
scale to the number of plants in the same producing region start at 4&#13;
million tons.&#13;

In addition to bauxite, North America imports more than 6 million&#13;
tons of alumina from Jamaica. Western Europe imports alumina from Jamaica as&#13;
well, making Jamaica the source of one-third of all alumina internationally&#13;
traded. The remainder originates mainly in Australia, Brazil, Venezuela,&#13;
China and ASEAN, as Table 43 shows.&#13;
Relatively more diversified trading patterns for aluminum were&#13;
obtained in the base case, even though they were geographically concen-&#13;
trated. North America, while supplying most of its regional needs from&#13;
smelters within the region, imports from Venezuela, the Caribbean, Guyana and&#13;
Surinam, as well as Oceania (see Table 44). Western Europe imports its&#13;
deficit from Ghana and Guinea, while Japan obtains supplies from Oceania,&#13;
India and Asian USSR. Brazil supplies most of Latin America.&#13;
Eastern Europe and the USSR import from Ghana, and North Africa.&#13;
Most other trade flows are within continental groupings.&#13;
The total cost of supplying the world's requirements of primary&#13;
aluminum in 2000, i.e., 31.6 million tons, without tariffs and levies, would&#13;
amount to $49.6 billion if the supply pattern of the base case were to&#13;
materialize. The breakdown of these costs is given in Table 45.&#13;
On average, the costs amount to $1,570 per ton of primary aluminum.&#13;
Electricity costs contribute on average $300, or 20%, with considerable&#13;
variations between OECD on the one hand, and LDCs and Eastern Europe/USSR on&#13;
the other. While the average cost for electricity in OECD is $338 per ton of&#13;
aluminum, the cost in LDCs, amounts to only $265 and in Eastern Europe/USSR&#13;
$252.&#13;
It should be borne in mind that these cost estimates do not include&#13;
capital charges for capacity that was already installed in 1980. Moreover,&#13;
neither profits nor levies or tariffs are taken into account.&#13;

We shall now turn to a comparative discussion of the sensitivity of&#13;
these results to changes in the major parameters, still neglecting the&#13;
existence of tariffs and levies.&#13;
5.2 Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
The results of the base case will be compared to a total of 10&#13;
variants, described in the table below. The first one investigates the impact&#13;
of a faster rate of growth of demand for primary aluminum. The second one&#13;
focuses on the effects of higher investment costs in LDCs. The next five&#13;
variants of the base case all relate to assumptions on the cost and&#13;
availability of electric power at actual or potential production sites.&#13;
Variant 8 studies the combined effect of higher investment and energy costs in&#13;
LDCs. Finally, variants 9 and 10 focus on trade, and investigate the impact&#13;
of different degrees of self-sufficiency for the main country groupings.&#13;
The results obtained in the sensitivity analysis will be described at&#13;
the aggregate level, focusing on production levels for bauxite, alumina, and&#13;
aluminum, and on cost components. At the disaggregate level, attention will&#13;
be paid to the effects of different assumptions on new capacity construction.&#13;
Production Levels&#13;
Table 47 summarizes the results of the ten variants of the base case&#13;
for the three country groupings with regard to production levels.&#13;
If demand for primary aluminum grows faster than assumed in the base&#13;
case, and reaches almost 39 million tons by the year 2000 rather than 31.6&#13;
million, almost all additional production of bauxite, alumina and aluminum&#13;
occurs in LDCs. As a result, LDCs will produce three quarters of all bauxite,&#13;
and about one-half of all alumina and aluminum in the world by the end of the&#13;
century.&#13;
Variant 2 focuses on investment cost in LDCs. Although the base case&#13;
assumptions recognize that investment costs in LDCs can normally be expected&#13;
to be higher than in industrialized countries, and so-called infrastructure&#13;
factors add from 10 to 25 percent to investment costs, we may still have&#13;
underestimated capital cost requirements in LDCs as a group. In this variant,&#13;
therefore, we have added another 25 percent to investment costs in LDCs. 1/&#13;
As Table 47 shows, the production of bauxite and alumina in OECD&#13;
would be much higher than in the base case, entirely at the expense of LDCs as&#13;
a group. Eastern Europe and USSR are not affected. Moreover, in the case of&#13;
bauxite, total production requirements are larger because of the lower quality&#13;
bauxite produced in OECD. However, for aluminum, the change in production&#13;
levels is much less dramatic, implying that the availability of relatively&#13;
1/ This variant may be given another interpretation: the 25 percent mark-up&#13;
represents a proxy for risk, in the sense that investment in LDCs carries&#13;
risks that result in higher real investment charges.&#13;

cheap electric power continues to bestow a cost advantage upon LDCs, even if&#13;
investment costs were 25 percent higher. This results in the unusual&#13;
situation in which developed countries are the dominant producers of&#13;
intermediate product (alumina), of which a substantial proportion is&#13;
subsequently transformed into final product (aluminum) in LDCs. To some&#13;
extent this production pattern already occurs. For example, Kaiser Aluminum&#13;
ships alumina from a refinery in Louisana to Ghana where aluminum ingots are&#13;
produced with low-cost power.&#13;
Variants 3-7 focus on electric power. Within the range of&#13;
asusmptions made, the effects of changes in cost or availabilities of electric&#13;
power on production levels in the three country groupings is surprisingly&#13;
small. Neither a change in Canadian electric power costs, or an increase in&#13;
the price of low cost power in LDCs has noticeable effect on production&#13;
levels. Rather drastic changes in the assumptions regarding the availability&#13;
of low-cost power--50% less, none, or 100% more--does affect production levels&#13;
in OECD and LDCs relative to the base case.&#13;
Variant 5 and 7 have very similar results, mostly by coincidence.&#13;
While neither production levels for bauxite nor alumina are affected, as&#13;
compared to the base case, a substantial amount of additional aluminum&#13;
smelting capacity expansion would take place in LDCs rather than in OECD&#13;
countries. In the case of variant 5, the lower availability of low cost&#13;
electricity in OECD provides an effective constraint on capacity expansion, in&#13;
favor of LDCs with relatively abundant low-cost power, even in the presence of&#13;
this constraint. Conversely, when low cost power availability is doubled&#13;
everywhere, some LDC locations that were hitherto not cost-efficient could&#13;
expand smelting capacity, at the expense of OECD countries.&#13;
In variant 6, it is assumed that no low cost electricity is available&#13;
anywhere. In that case, more smelting capacity is installed in the main&#13;
consuming regions, i.e., OECD, in order to save on transport cost and&#13;
investment charges. In comparison to the base case, this variant gives a very&#13;
similar picture at the aggregate level.&#13;
In variant 8, the combined effect on production levels is determined&#13;
by an increase in capital costs and low-cost electricity in LDCs of 25&#13;
percent. It appears that the effects are virtually identical to those found&#13;
for variant 2, where only investment costs are increased. Production levels&#13;
for bauxite and alumina are severely affected as a result of the increase in&#13;
capital costs in LDCs. However, the effect on alumina production is marginal,&#13;
and, as a group, LDCs retain their share of world production.&#13;
Variants 9 and 10 focus on the impact of trade policies that differ&#13;
from free trade, by varying assumptions with regard to the degree of self-&#13;
sufficiency in all products that the main country groupings might want to&#13;
achieve. In variant 9, we assume that 75 percent of total requirements must&#13;
come from within each grouping; in variant 10 we assume that no trade is&#13;
permitted at all among the three groups. Trade restrictions of this sort&#13;
would have severe repercussions for LDCs as a group. In the case of partial&#13;
trade, production levels for both bauxite and alumina would fall although the&#13;
production pattern for aluminum would not be affected much. However, in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
absence of trade among the groups, also the aluminum production level in LDCs&#13;
will fall substantially, such that less than one-quarter of world production&#13;
will take place in these countries, as opposed to over 60 percent in OECD.&#13;
Costs&#13;
What are the cost implications of these variants of the base case?&#13;
Table 48 gives the relevant details. A higher rate of growth of demand,&#13;
necessitating the construction of a considerable amount of additional&#13;
capacity, not only raises total cost of meeting aluminum requirements, it also&#13;
raises the average costs per ton from $1,569 to $1,665.&#13;
If no low cost electric power would be available to the aluminum&#13;
sector by 2000, the cost implications would be quite substantial. Average&#13;
cost per ton of primary aluminum would be 8% higher, and total cost of meeting&#13;
the world's alumina requirements would increase by $4 billion. The increase&#13;
in operating costs on account of electricity costs would be offset by lower&#13;
investment costs (because of a shift to OECD countries) and lower transport&#13;
costs.&#13;
The two scenarios relating to trade also exhibit substantial cost&#13;
increases. Not surprisingly, total self-sufficiency for each bloc carries the&#13;
largest cost, 7 percent more than the base case.&#13;
Considering the individual cost components of the other variants, and&#13;
leaving aside the high demand variant--where every cost element is larger--it&#13;
is striking how few of the cost components are substantially different from&#13;
the base case. It is not surprising that when capital costs in LDCs are&#13;
raised, investment charges increase. Similarly, once it is demonstrated that&#13;
LDCs have gained a comparative cost advantage in aluminum smelting, a trade&#13;
embargo among blocs, necessitating an increase in aluminum production in OECD&#13;
results in much higher operating costs. However, considering the average cost&#13;
per ton associated with each variant, it is striking how narrow the range of&#13;
estimates is.&#13;
We shall now turn to a discussion of the results of the sensitivity&#13;
analysis of the individual country or region level; the focus will be on&#13;
capacity expansion.&#13;
Capacity Expansion&#13;
Tables 49, 50, and 51 summarize the results with respect to the&#13;
capacity expansion that would take place under each of the variants that were&#13;
considered at the country or region level.&#13;
In the case of bauxite, under no circumstances would new mines be&#13;
opened in either Europe or Western Europe. In Australia, mine expansion&#13;
beyond the level currently committed is possible in two cases: if investment&#13;
costs for mines in LDCs are seriously underestimated in the base case&#13;
(variants 2 and 8), and if trade policies impose partial or total self-&#13;
sufficiency on OECD. In all other cases, the needed mine expansion will take&#13;
place in LDCs, mostly in Latin America and the Caribbean, followed by Asia,&#13;
and lastly, in Africa.&#13;

In most cases, mine expansion in Jamaica is limited to 30-35 million&#13;
tons. This is due to our assumption that at some point each country reaches a&#13;
production volume where diseconomies of scale begin to occur, and beyond which&#13;
investment cost per ton begin to increase. It is only when capital costs in&#13;
LDCs are higher than assumed in the base case that mine expansion in Jamaica&#13;
is larger. This is due to the fact that in that case more alumina is produced&#13;
in North America on the basis of imported Jamaican bauxite, as is shown in&#13;
Table 50.&#13;
In all variants, capacity expansion for alumina is widespread,&#13;
although in Africa, only Ghana is efficient under most assumptions. While the&#13;
U.S., Western Europe and Australia remain consistently efficient locations for&#13;
alumina refineries, most of the expansion takes place in LDCs. In Latin&#13;
America, Jamaica, Brazil and Venezuela, are attractive locations under most&#13;
conditions, while in Asia, India, China and ASEAN fall into that category.&#13;
The sensitivity analysis confirms a point made earlier, i.e., that the&#13;
locational pattern for alumina refineries is the most volatile within the&#13;
sector. A change in the assumption relating to investment costs in LDCs&#13;
causes a major shift in the amount of expansion within OECD, as variants 2 and&#13;
8 show.&#13;
In Table 51, capacity expansion results are given for aluminum&#13;
smelting. Under all circumstances, capacity in OECD will be expanded by some&#13;
4-5 million tons. Most of this expansion will take place in Australia and&#13;
Western Canada, except if the availability of low cost power in the latter is&#13;
reduced by 50%. If no low cost power is available anywhere, smelting capacity&#13;
expansion in OECD would be concentrated in the Western US, Western Europe and&#13;
Australia.&#13;
The major smelting capacity expansion in Latin America is likely to&#13;
take place in Brazil, one-half of the total under most assumptions. The&#13;
remainder is most likely to be located in Venezuela and in Central America.&#13;
In Africa, in most of the variants considered, Ghana, Guinea and&#13;
Zaire, as well as North Africa, emerge consistently as potential sites for&#13;
relatively modest new smelter capacity. Ghana would be the major beneficiary&#13;
of a change in assumptions with regard to the availability of low-cost power&#13;
(variant 5), expanding aluminum smelting capacity by 1.7 million tons, mainly&#13;
for shipment to Europe.&#13;
In Asia, ASEAN (including Indonesia) would be the site for the&#13;
largest smelting capacity expansion. Moreover, India, China and the Middle&#13;
East emerge consistently as efficient sites under most circumstances.&#13;
In conclusion, it may be said that the sensitivity analysis so far&#13;
conducted reveals a remarkable degree of stability to the capacity expansion&#13;
pattern of the base case. Individual country or regional differences do&#13;
occur, but a fairly robust pattern of efficient future producing locations can&#13;
be derived.&#13;

5.3 The Impact of Tariffs and Levies&#13;
Assuming that present tariffs, levies and royalties on the products&#13;
of the aluminum sector continue to be imposed during the period 1980-2000--an&#13;
admittedly strong assumption--one can determine their impact in terms of&#13;
capacity expansion and costs. In what follows, we shall confine the&#13;
comparison to the base case, with and without tariffs and levies.&#13;
At the aggregate level, the results show considerable similarity. As&#13;
Table 52 shows, the capacity expansion patterns for bauxite are identical.&#13;
For alumina and aluminum, capacity in OECD expands somewhat less, while LDCs&#13;
increase their production capacity even more rapidly than in the base case.&#13;
The main reason for this shift is the impact of protective tariffs, causing&#13;
some decline in trade between blocs.&#13;
At the individual country level, differences between the base case&#13;
with and without tariffs and levies become appreciable. Tables 53, 54 and 55&#13;
give the detailed results for capacity expansion of bauxite, alumina and&#13;
aluminum respectively.&#13;
For bauxite, most of the changes in mining capacity expansion occur&#13;
within regions rather than among them. Leaving aside Australia, where in&#13;
either case only currently committed capacity expansion takes place, the&#13;
general pattern is that within regions, capacity expansion shifts from&#13;
countries with relatively high levies to countries with relatively low or no&#13;
levies, i.e., from Jamaica to Venezuela and Brazil in Latin America, and from&#13;
Guinea to Ghana in Africa. In Asia, both India and Indonesia would be good&#13;
locations for increased mining capacity if the present structure of tariffs&#13;
and levies remains in place.&#13;
Table 54 shows alumina capacity expansion for the base case with and&#13;
without tariffs and levies. The main differences appear again at the country&#13;
level. Capacity expansion is considerably lower in the U.S. and W. Europe.&#13;
Both Central America and Suriname cease to be attractive locations for alumina&#13;
refining, in favor of other Latin American countries (Brazil, Guyana and&#13;
Venezuela).&#13;
The more modest growth of refining capacity in U.S. and Western&#13;
Europe results in larger capacity expansion in Ghana and the appearance of&#13;
North Africa as an attractive location for alumina refining. In Asia, the&#13;
impact of tariffs and levies is limited to a rearrangement of capacities&#13;
within the region, with India gaining and China and ASEAN experiencing slower&#13;
growth of capacity.&#13;
Aluminum capacity expansion is shown in Table 55. The patterns&#13;
emerging for the base case with and without tariffs and levies are strikingly&#13;
similar, once more illustrating the importance of electric power cost in&#13;
explaining locational patterns. The most significant change is a much larger&#13;
smelting capacity expansion in China when tariffs and levies are taken into&#13;
account. The existing tariff of 20 percent on imported aluminum provides an&#13;
effective barrier to trade, and China would produce all its aluminum&#13;
requirements domestically. This would lead to a loss of an export market for&#13;
&#13;

Australia, and, indirectly, for Canada. In turn, Ghana would become a major&#13;
alumina exporter to Western Europe. In all other cases, the pattern of&#13;
capacity expansion for aluminum smelters is unaffected by taking account of&#13;
tariffs and levies.&#13;
Costs&#13;
The final issue to be considered here is the impact on the structure&#13;
and level of costs of the introduction of tariffs and levies. The relevant&#13;
results are summarized in Table 56. The total costs increase by over U.S.&#13;
$1.5 billion, or by 3% per ton of aluminum. Most of the cost increase is due&#13;
to tariffs, i.e., US$1 billion. Levies add another $230 million, while the&#13;
remainder is due to relatively smaller increases in investment, operating and&#13;
transport costs. Given the changes that occur in production and trade&#13;
patterns once tariffs and levies are taken into account, the impact on the&#13;
real cost structure of the world aluminum industry is surprising small, less&#13;
than one percent.&#13;

6. Conclusions&#13;
This study presented a framework for doing systematic analysis on&#13;
future investment patterns in the bauxite/aluminum industry, taking into&#13;
account comparative advantages of each region, for each processing stage. One&#13;
of the major undertakings was the establishment of a comprehensive data&#13;
base. This step was a difficult one not only because of the scarcity of data&#13;
readily available, but also because it was necessary to make judgements on&#13;
factors which are difficult to quantify. The second step dealt with selecting&#13;
and applying the method of analysis. The methodology used was mixed integer&#13;
linear programming, which permitted us to carry out systematic investment&#13;
analysis taking explicitly into account interdependencies among location,&#13;
scale, technology and product mix of new productive investment. Many variants&#13;
were tested in this framework in order to carry out sensitivity analysis on&#13;
the various parameters of the model.&#13;
The results of the study showed that, due to the abundance of cheap&#13;
bauxite reserves in the LDCs, most new mining investments are likely to take&#13;
place in those countries. More than 90 percent of all new bauxite mine&#13;
capacity would be installed in LDCs, whose share in bauxite mining would&#13;
increase from less than 50 percent in 1980 to about 70 percent in 2000.&#13;
Sensitivity analysis on these results showed them to be fairly robust at the&#13;
aggregate level, although with the introduction of levies and tariffs, mine&#13;
capacity expansion shifted within developing countries (i.e., from Jamaica and&#13;
Guinea to Venezuela, Brazil and Ghana).&#13;
The pattern of location of new alumina refineries proved to be the&#13;
most sensitive to changes in the data since this is determined mainly not by&#13;
resource endowments as for bauxite and aluminum but by differences in costs,&#13;
shipping distances and the application of levies and tariffs. Thus, the share&#13;
of alumina production for LDCs which was 20 percent in 1980, could range in&#13;
2000 from 16 to 50 percent, according to which version of the model follows&#13;
more closely future events.&#13;
One would expect that the availability in LDCs makes these countries&#13;
most promising locations for new aluminum smelters. The model confirms this&#13;
hypothesis, as the share of aluminum smelter capacity in LDCs increases from&#13;
15 percent in 1980 to about 40 percent by 2000. Investments in aluminum&#13;
smelters are likely to be widely distributed among developing countries (see&#13;
Table 15).&#13;
While the availability of low cost energy makes it attractive for&#13;
companies to locate smelters in developing countries, this study finds some&#13;
qualifications to it. First, one must take into account the existence of long&#13;
term contracts for cheap electricity supplies in industrial countries which&#13;
would make it feasible for many existing smelters to continue profitable&#13;
operations in those locations. Second, new investments are expensive and in&#13;
many cases they require heavy infrastructure expenditures, with the result&#13;
that low cost electricity advantages may be wiped out by high capital costs.&#13;
&#13;

Although this study is presented as a finished product we intend to&#13;
make it part of an ongoing operation. It is hoped that it will serve as a&#13;
basis for discussions with the industry and related institutions. Besides,&#13;
the data base will be periodically updated in order to incorporate future&#13;
changes and to do further analysis as new requirements arise.&#13;

            Worldwide investment analysis : the case of aluminum
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This study focuses on the likely long
            term trends in investment, production and trade patterns in
            the world aluminum industry. It first introduces the non
            specialist reader to the technical characteristics of
            bauxite mining and the production of alumina and aluminum.
            Special emphasis is placed on the critical importance of
            energy requirements. Next, a verbal description of the
            method of analysis is presented. A detailed technical
            statement of the mathematical programming mmodel, and the
            associated data input are provided in two annexes to the
            study. The main conclusion drawn from the analysis is that
            the emerging pattern of investment, production and trade is
            very robust in the light of the changes that were made in
            the main parameters, particularly for bauxite and aluminum.
