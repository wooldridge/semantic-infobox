&amp;#12;           Box 2: Lending Operations Principles&#13;
            (i) IBRD makes loans to governments, governmental authorities or private enterprises in the territories of member&#13;
                 countries. A loan that is not made directly to the member in whose territories the project is located must be&#13;
                 guaranteed as to principal, interest and other charges by the member or its central bank or a comparable agency of&#13;
                 the member acceptable to IBRD. A guarantee by the member itself has been obtained in all such cases to date.&#13;
             (ii) IBRD's loans are designed to promote the use of resources for productive purposes in its member countries.&#13;
                  Investment projects financed by IBRD loans are required to meet IBRD's standards for technical, economic,&#13;
                  financial, institutional and environmental soundness. Specific provisions apply to development policy lending&#13;
                  financed by IBRD loans, including the treatment of the macroeconomic framework, poverty and social impact,&#13;
                  environment, forests and other natural resources.&#13;
             (iii) In making loans, IBRD must act prudently and pay due regard to the prospects of repayment. Decisions to make&#13;
                   loans are based upon, among other things, studies by IBRD of a member country's economic structure, including&#13;
                   assessments of its resources and ability to generate sufficient foreign exchange to meet debt-service obligations.&#13;
             (iv) IBRD must be satisfied that in the prevailing market conditions (taking into account the member's overall external&#13;
                  financing requirements), the borrower would be unable to obtain financing under conditions which, in the opinion&#13;
                  of IBRD, are reasonable for the borrower. However, this does not preclude lending to members who may have&#13;
                  access to international credit markets. It is the intention of IBRD to promote private investment, not to compete&#13;
                  with it.&#13;
             (v) The use of loan proceeds is supervised. IBRD makes arrangements intended to ensure that funds loaned are used&#13;
                 only for authorized purposes and, where relevant, with due attention to considerations of cost-effectiveness. This&#13;
                 policy is enforced primarily by requiring borrowers (a) to submit documentation establishing, to IBRD's&#13;
                 satisfaction, that the expenditures financed with the proceeds of loans are made in conformity with the applicable&#13;
                 lending agreements and (b) to maximize competition in the procurement of goods and services by using, wherever&#13;
                 possible, international competitive bidding or, when it is not appropriate, other procedures that ensure maximum&#13;
                 economy and efficiency. In addition, under pilot programs approved by the Executive Directors, IBRD considers&#13;
                 the use of borrower country procurement, and environmental and social safeguard systems in selected operations&#13;
                 where these systems are assessed by IBRD as being equivalent to IBRD's systems and where the borrower's&#13;
                 policies and procedures, implementation practices, track record, fiduciary and safeguard risks and capacity are&#13;
                 considered acceptable to IBRD.&#13;

On June 30, 2007, IBRD adopted Statement of                Position (FSP) FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8,&#13;
Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,                    Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about&#13;

FAS 106 and FAS 132(R). As required by FAS 158,            effective for reporting periods (interim and annual)&#13;
IBRD recognized on the Balance Sheet the funded            that ended after December 15, 2008. The application&#13;
status of its defined benefit postretirement plans,        of this FSP did not have a material impact on&#13;

the plan assets and the benefit obligation.                In December 2008, FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-&#13;
Additionally, IBRD recognized actuarial gains or           1, Employers' Disclosures about Postretirement&#13;
losses and prior service costs or credits that arose       Benefit Plan Assets. This FSP amends FAS 132 (R),&#13;
during the period as part of Other Comprehensive           Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other&#13;

components of net periodic benefit cost based upon         guidance on an employer's disclosures about plan&#13;
the current amortization and recognition                   assets of a defined benefit pension or other&#13;
requirements of FAS 87 and FAS 106. FAS 158 also           postretirement plan. Among other things, this FSP&#13;
eliminated the provisions of FAS 87 and FAS 106            requires employers to annually disclose information&#13;
that allowed plan assets and obligations to be             about fair value measurements of plan assets that are&#13;

Therefore, this change had no effect on IBRD's             and will result in additional disclosures being made&#13;

Effective July 1, 2008, IBRD adopted FAS 157.              Effective March 31, 2009, IBRD adopted FASB's&#13;

In conjunction with the adoption of FAS 157, IBRD          In April 2009, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP)&#13;

          3.1 Eligibility criteria&#13;
                                                                             economically sound purposes to which those&#13;
          Two basic criteria govern a country's eligibility for              countries have assigned high development priority,&#13;
          IDA resources: relative poverty defined as gross                   and that the financing is utilized as intended. Within&#13;
          national income (GNI) per capita below an                          the scope permitted by the Articles, application of&#13;
          established threshold (updated annually), and lack of              these principles must be developed and adjusted in&#13;
          creditworthiness to borrow on market terms and                     light of experience and changing conditions.&#13;
          therefore, a need for concessional resources.&#13;
          Currently, seventy-nine countries are eligible to&#13;
          borrow from IDA. Of these, sixty-five are not&#13;
          considered sufficiently creditworthy to borrow from&#13;
&#13;
          Box 1: Financing Principles&#13;
&#13;
          (i)      IDA may provide financing in the form of development credits, grants and guarantees directly to its&#13;
                   members, public or private entities and regional or public international organizations.&#13;
          (ii) IDA's financing is designed to promote economic development, increase productivity and thus raise&#13;
               standards of living in its member countries. Investment projects financed by IDA are required to meet IDA's&#13;
               standards for technical, economic, financial, institutional and environmental soundness. Specific provisions&#13;
               apply to development policy financing, including the treatment of the macroeconomic framework, poverty&#13;
               and social impact, environment, forests and other natural resources.&#13;
          (iii) Decisions to approve financing are based upon, among other things, studies by IDA of a member country's&#13;
                economic structure, including assessments of its resources and ability to generate sufficient foreign&#13;
                exchange to meet debt-service obligations.&#13;
          (iv) IDA must be satisfied that in the prevailing market conditions (taking into account the member's overall&#13;
               external financing requirements), the borrower would be unable to obtain financing under conditions which,&#13;
               in the opinion of IDA, are reasonable for the borrower. This would include loans made by private sources&#13;
               or IBRD.&#13;
          (v) The use of financing proceeds is supervised. IDA makes arrangements intended to ensure that funds&#13;
              provided are used only for authorized purposes and, where relevant, with due attention to considerations&#13;
              of cost-effectiveness. This policy is enforced primarily by requiring borrowers (a) to submit documentation&#13;
              establishing, to IDA's satisfaction, that the expenditures financed with the proceeds of development credits&#13;
              or grants are made in conformity with the applicable financing agreements, and (b) to maximize&#13;
              competition in the procurement of goods and services by using, wherever possible, international&#13;
              competitive bidding procedures or, when it is not appropriate, other procedures that ensure maximum&#13;
              economy and efficiency. In addition, under pilot programs approved by the Executive Directors, IDA&#13;
              considers the use of borrower country procurement, and environmental and social safeguard systems in&#13;
              selected operations where these systems are assessed by IDA as being equivalent to IDA's systems and&#13;
              where the borrower's policies and procedures, implementation practices, track record, fiduciary and&#13;
              safeguard risks and capacity are considered acceptable to IDA.&#13;

IDA's financing falls into one of two categories ­          in detail below.&#13;
investment lending or development policy lending.&#13;

Investment lending is generally used to finance&#13;
goods, works, and services in support of economic           Currencies&#13;

investment lending has remained fairly consistent at        Charges on development credits&#13;
between 74% in FY2006 and 80% in FY2009 as&#13;
illustrated in Chart 2.                                     IDA's policy is to maintain its charges (service and&#13;

       Expected Contributions&#13;
       The best estimate of the amount of contributions expected to be paid by IBRD and IDA combined is $149million&#13;
       to the SRP and $54 million to the RSBP during the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009. IDA's share of these&#13;
       estimated contributions will be based on the applicable share ratio for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.&#13;
       NOTE M--FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS&#13;
       Effective July 1, 2008, IDA adopted FAS 157 which defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for&#13;
       measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value&#13;
       and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements.&#13;
       FAS 157 establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy under which financial instruments are categorized based on&#13;
       the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique.&#13;

&#13;
The Development Committee met today, October 12, 2008, in Washington DC.&#13;
&#13;
1. Our meeting took place at a critical time for the global economy, with financial markets&#13;
experiencing unprecedented turmoil. Developing and transition countries (DTCs--many of&#13;
them already hit hard by current high prices for energy and essential foodstuffs--risk very&#13;
serious setbacks to their efforts to improve the lives of their populations from any prolonged&#13;
tightening of credit or sustained global slowdown. The poorest and most vulnerable groups risk&#13;
the most serious--and in some cases permanent--damage.&#13;
&#13;
2. Against this background, we endorse the commitments made yesterday at the International Monetary and Financial&#13;
Committee.&#13;
&#13;
3. We stressed that aid volumes need to be consistent with existing commitments and we called for full compliance with&#13;
these commitments.&#13;
&#13;
4. In support of these concerted actions, we called on the World Bank to join with the IMF in&#13;
drawing on the full range of its resources--finance, analysis, and advice--to help DTCs strengthen their economies, maintain&#13;
growth, and protect the most vulnerable groups against the impact of the current crises.&#13;
&#13;
5. The World Bank Group stands ready to help its partner countries:&#13;
&#13;
    ·   The Bank's recently announced $1.2 billion rapid financing facility is providing&#13;
        immediate help for countries coping with the impact of high food prices on the poor, and&#13;
        already has $850 million approved or in the pipeline. We urge countries to consider&#13;
        making contributions to this fund.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   We encouraged the Bank and its partners to move forward with a planned new program--&#13;
        Energy for the Poor--that would provide rapid support for countries' efforts to&#13;
        strengthen social safety nets to protect the poor against the impact of high fuel bills.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   IBRD has the financial capacity to comfortably double its annual lending to developing countries&#13;
        to meet additional demand from clients. IBRD lending was US$13.5 billion last fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   We urged IFC to explore options for helping recapitalize banks in developing countries&#13;
        adversely affected by the global liquidity crisis, including the possibility of a fund.&#13;
&#13;
    We also supported longer-term efforts beyond the immediate crisis, including:&#13;
&#13;
    ·   Expanded help for energy-deficit countries to improve energy efficiency and improve&#13;
        domestic production to reduce their vulnerability to future price shocks.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   Reforms designed to increase the World Bank's responsiveness to its clients.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   A new strategic framework for the World Bank to play a stronger role in helping&#13;
        countries deal with the causes and effects of climate change, and the recent launch of the&#13;
        new Climate Investment Funds.&#13;

April 26, 2009&#13;
&#13;
1. The Development Committee met today, April 26, 2009, in Washington, DC.&#13;
&#13;
2. The global economy has deteriorated dramatically since our last meeting. Developing&#13;
countries face especially serious consequences, as the financial and economic crisis turns into a&#13;
human and development calamity. Hard-earned progress toward the Millennium Development&#13;
Goals (MDGs) is now in jeopardy. The crisis has already driven more than 50 million people&#13;
into extreme poverty, particularly women and children. We must alleviate its impact on&#13;
developing countries and facilitate their contribution to global recovery.&#13;
&#13;
3. The World Bank Group (WBG) and the IMF have shown leadership and complement each&#13;
other in helping developing countries respond to the crisis, enabling countercyclical measures,&#13;
and helping to bridge the huge financing gap, including efforts to revive private capital flows.&#13;
Multilateral institutions need the resources and capacity for effective crisis response and&#13;
prevention. We welcomed member countries' commitments to a substantial increase in resources&#13;
for the IMF.&#13;
&#13;
4. More needs to be done as the crisis unfolds further. We now need to translate our respective&#13;
commitments, including those made by the participants at the recent London Summit, into&#13;
concerted action and additional resources. We urged all donors to accelerate delivery of&#13;
commitments to increase aid, and for us all to consider going beyond existing commitments.&#13;
&#13;
5. We welcomed the WBG's efforts to ensure a timely crisis response while maintaining its&#13;
focus on long-term development challenges, including those posed by climate change and the&#13;
need to accelerate progress toward the MDGs. We noted the expected trebling of IBRD lending&#13;
this fiscal year and the fast tracking of IDA 15 commitments. We supported the initiatives the&#13;
WBG has launched and encouraged their timely implementation:&#13;
&#13;
    ·    To protect the poorest, the Bank has set up the Vulnerability Financing Facility, including&#13;
         the Global Food Crisis Response Program and the new Rapid Social Response Program. IFC&#13;
         has also created the Microfinance Enhancement Facility to help poor borrowers.&#13;
&#13;
    ·    To reinvigorate trade finance, IFC has expanded its Global Trade Finance Program from&#13;
         $1 billion to $3 billion, and has also launched its Global Trade Liquidity Program, expected&#13;
         to support up to $50 billion of trade over the next three years.&#13;
&#13;
    ·    To maintain infrastructure development and create jobs, the Bank has established the&#13;
         Infrastructure Recovery and Assets Platform. The Bank will lend up to $15 billion a year for&#13;
         infrastructure, while IFC has launched the Infrastructure Crisis Facility.&#13;
&#13;
    ·    To help support the financial sector, IFC has created the Capitalization Fund to provide&#13;
         additional capital for developing country banks. MIGA has extended guarantees to loans to&#13;
         Eastern Europe for coverage of $500 million.&#13;
&#13;
Many of these initiatives are designed to mobilize more resources, both public and private. We&#13;
welcomed the additional contributions that have been made and urged governments to consider&#13;
further support. In addition, we called upon the WBG to update as appropriate its policies,&#13;
instruments, and strategies in light of lessons learned from the crisis.&#13;
&amp;#12;6. We confirmed our support for making optimal use of IBRD's balance sheet with lending of&#13;
up to $100 billion over three years. Given the possibility of a slow recovery, we considered the&#13;
potential need to deploy additional resources and asked the WBG to review the financial&#13;
capacity, including the capital adequacy, of IBRD and IFC, and the adequacy of the concessional&#13;
resources going to IDA countries, for our further consideration at the 2009 Annual Meetings.&#13;
&#13;
7. The crisis and the need for a strong multilateral response further highlight the relevance of&#13;
ensuring enhanced voice and participation of developing and transition countries in the&#13;
governance of the WBG. Based on agreement at our last meeting for the Board to develop&#13;
principles, criteria, and proposals for Bank shareholding, we agreed to accelerate work on the&#13;
second phase of the reform with a view to reaching agreement by the 2010 Spring Meetings.&#13;
This must involve all shareholders in a transparent, consultative, and inclusive process.&#13;
&#13;
8. We welcomed the Board's review of internal governance and asked the WBG to continue the&#13;
work, as part of the comprehensive approach to strengthening WBG governance and overall&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
9. The Committee's next meeting is scheduled for October 5, 2009, in Istanbul.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The World Bank group, among the
            world's largest development institutions, is a major
            source of financial and technical assistance to developing
            countries around the world. In fiscal 2009, the World Bank
            group sponsored 767 projects with a total commitment of
            $58.8 billion, distributed in credits, loans, grants, and
            guarantees. This fiscal year's funding marks a 54
            percent increase over the previous fiscal year and a record
            high for the Bank group. The Bank group's investment
            projects are aimed largely at improving infrastructure
            services associated with poverty reduction and enhanced
            growth. In fiscal 2009, the Bank group committed $20.7
            billion to infrastructure, a critical sector to provide the
            foundation for rapid recovery from the crisis and to support
            job creation. The sustainable infrastructure action plan,
            launched in July 2008, will leverage up to $72 billion to
            provide additional financing of up to $149 billion in public
            and private investments over fiscal 2009-11. The Bank
            group's investment projects are aimed largely at
            improving infrastructure services associated with poverty
            reduction and enhanced growth.
