Borrower                          The Republic of Yemen&#13;
Implementing                      The Ministry of Planning and Development through a Steering&#13;
Agency                            Committee and its Project Management Unit&#13;
Beneficiaries              .      Potential unemployed and recipients of improved infrastructure&#13;
services&#13;
Amount                     :      SDR17 million&#13;
Terms                             Standard, with 40-year maturity and 10 years' grace&#13;
Commitment Charge                 Standard (a variable rate between 0 and 0.5 percent of the&#13;
undisbursed credit balance set annually by the Executive Directors&#13;
of IDA)&#13;
Project Objectives         :      The overall objective of the project is to mitigate potential adverse&#13;
effects of economic adjustment. Specific objective is to generate an&#13;
estimated 75,000-96,000 work-months of employment at a cost&#13;
range of US$260 to US$350 per work-month. It is also expected&#13;
that the project would help deliver much needed infrastructure&#13;
services, improve environmental and sanitary conditions and enhance&#13;
community participation in preparing and implementing sub-projects&#13;
for civil works. Achievement of the project's development objective&#13;
will be monitored through performance indicators and the findings&#13;
will be reflected in quarterly progress reports and in quarterly audits.&#13;
Project Description        :      The project has three components: (i) a multi-sectoral, labor-&#13;
intensive program of essential, small-scale public works aimed at&#13;
rehabilitating, extending or maintaining urban and rural infrastructure&#13;
such as: water supply, streets and roads, storm water drainage, flood&#13;
protection, irrigation, soil conservation, health and education&#13;
facilities. Under the project, an estimated 250-300 sub-projects&#13;
would be selected according to agreed criteria and implemented; (ii)&#13;
establishment of a Steering Committee and as its secretariat, a&#13;
Project Management Unit to manage project implementation; and (iii)&#13;
a technical assistance program to develop the capacity of the Project&#13;
Management Unit; to prepare and implement sub-projects; and to&#13;
provide training to local consulting and construction companies. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
IDA funds would help finance: (i) the implementation of sub-&#13;
projects; (ii) the establishment and operation of the Project&#13;
Management Unit; and (iii) technical assistance.&#13;
Benefits                      :      The major project benefit refers to the number of jobs that are&#13;
expected to be created, which for the total project would correspond&#13;
to an estimated 75,000-96,000 work-months of direct employment.&#13;
In addition, it is assumed that jobs to be created indirectly, under&#13;
various activities serving the construction industry, would correspond&#13;
to about 40-50 percent of those to be created directly. Apart from&#13;
job creation, the sub-projects will provide additional benefits from&#13;
improved infrastructure services, protection of the environment and&#13;
better health and education facilities.&#13;
Risks                         :       The project has several risks referring to: (i) maintaining a high&#13;
labor content in the sub-projects; this risk would be mitigated by&#13;
selecting labor-intensive sub-projects; (ii) maintaining an acceptable&#13;
quality of works; this risk will be addressed by providing technical&#13;
assistance and training to local consultants and contractors as well as&#13;
NGOs; and (iii) ensuring sustainability of completed works; this risk&#13;
would be addressed in the selection of sub-projects and in the&#13;
development of NGOs' capabilities to assist communities in operation&#13;
and maintenance. To respond to all these risks, flexibility has been&#13;
built into the project to allow for adjustments, as necessary, in sub-&#13;
project selection and in implementation arrangements.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A. Country Background&#13;
1.1       The Republic of Yemen (ROY) was established in May 1990, when the Yemen Arab Republic&#13;
(YAR) in the north and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) in the south were united. North&#13;
Yemen had been ruled under a traditional system of governance and virtually closed to the outside world until&#13;
1962, when an army coup overthrew the last Iman and declared the formation of the YAR. South Yemen&#13;
had been under British rule for a century and a half, with the port of Aden serving as an entrepot for British&#13;
trading interests, until nationalist forces took over in 1967. PDRY became an independent country in 1970.&#13;
1.2       The unified Government had designated 1990-92 as a transition period, during which it&#13;
concentrated on the difficult task of merging the two administrations and realigning the two economic&#13;
systems. The transition period culminated in nation-wide parliamentary elections in April 1993. However,&#13;
serioui difficulties arose leading to civil war from May to July 1994. Following the cessation of hostilities&#13;
a coalition government was formed that is supportive of the current reform program.&#13;
1.3       To achieve sustainable growth and alleviate poverty, the Government has iecognized that a new&#13;
development strategy is required. Given the inadequacies of the public sector and poor public finances, the&#13;
source of growth for the future would be the private sector. Accordingly, the strategy for the modernization&#13;
and development of the economy would be based upon a reduced role of the public sector, the development&#13;
of the private sector, and export diversification.&#13;
B. Economic Reform Program&#13;
1.4      In an effort to deal with the country's substantial econeonic problems, the Government is&#13;
implemen,ing a comprehensive program of economic stabilization and structural adjustment with support from&#13;
IDA and the IMF. In designing the economic reform program, the Government considered a number of&#13;
factors. Central among them are: managing the fiscal dinmensions and consequences of the reform measures,&#13;
stimulating a private sector supply response (that is, increased output and employment), and increasing&#13;
economic efficiency. Within this framework, the Government's program focuses on three main areas:&#13;
(a) stabilization to restore macroeconomic balance and reduce inflation; (b) structural reform and adjustment&#13;
to stiimiulate medium- and long-term economic growth; and (c) social protection measures to minimize the&#13;
negative impact on the vulnerable an(d the poor during adjustment. The imnplementation of the early phases&#13;
of structural reforms would be supported by the Economic Reform Credit (ERC) (Credit No. 2840-YEM,&#13;
approved on April 9, 1996). Mitigation of potential adverse effects of adjustment over the medium-term is&#13;
to be achieved through different initiatives, including the Public Works Project and a proposed Social Fund&#13;
Project. These initiatives would aim at social protection, delivery of social services to communities, and job&#13;
creation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                           Public Works Project&#13;
C. Rationale For IDA Involvement&#13;
1.5       The Project is fully consistent with the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for&#13;
Yemen, presented to the Board on February 20, 1996. Economic reforms and poverty alleviation are among&#13;
the key thrusts of the CAS. During its implementation, the Project would also, to the extent feasible,&#13;
integrate the findings and recommendations of the Poverty Assessment study that is being prepared by using&#13;
the data to be generated on the poverty profile, characteristics of the poor, and geographical distribution of&#13;
poverty. The Project also complements ongoing and proposed IDA projects by providing infrastructure&#13;
services and improving environmental and sanitary conditions. The Project, moreover, builds on the&#13;
Emergency Recovery Project (Credit No. 2840-YEM) in Yemen as well as the experience in social funds and&#13;
small public works programs in other countries. Further, the framework provided by the Project can play&#13;
a catalytic role in attracting donor financing.&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
2.1        The overall objective of the project is to mitigate potential adverse effects of economic&#13;
adjustment. Specific objective is to generate an estimated 75,000-96,000 work-months of employment at a&#13;
cost range of US$260 to US$350 per work-month. It is also expected that the project would help deliver&#13;
much needed infrastructure services, improve environmental and sanitary conditions and enhance community&#13;
participation in preparing and implementing sub-projects for civil works. Achievement of the project's&#13;
development objective will be monitored through performance indicators and the findings will be reflected&#13;
in quarterly progress reports and in quarterly audits.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
2.2       The project would comprise:&#13;
(a)    small scale civil works in areas with above average unemployment rates for rehabilitation&#13;
and/or extension in the following sectors: (i) waste management: waste water collection&#13;
systems and storm water drains; cleaning of such systems; and solid waste collection and&#13;
sanitary landfills; (ii) urban development: water distribution systems; repairing and&#13;
paving (cobblestones) streets and footpaths; storm water drainage; flood protection; (iii)&#13;
rurai development: road repairs; water supply systems; cleaning and repairing of&#13;
irrigation canals; (iv) soil conservation: terracing and drainage works; small dams; and&#13;
(v) health and education: health centers and school buildings.&#13;
(b)    development of a project management capability comprising a Steering Committee (SC)&#13;
and a Project Management Unit (PMU) to be funded as the executive arm of the SC; and&#13;
(c)    provision of technical assistance services for: (i) the establishment of the PMU:&#13;
including preparation of organizational and staffing structures; framework agreements for&#13;
project management, personnel, administration, and operation; accounting and&#13;
management information systems; (ii) investment programming, monitoring and review;&#13;
(iii) sub-project preparation and implementation: including preparation of engineering&#13;
design and tender documents, and construction supervision; (iv) support to local&#13;
consulting and construction companies, including preparation for and organization of&#13;
workshops; and (v) auditing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Public Works Project                                                                                   3&#13;
2.3        The sub-projects would be selected according to established criteria (para. 3.13) agreed with the&#13;
Government and would concentrate on urban/rural areas with above average unemployment rates. During&#13;
the initial stages of Project implementation, the sub-projects would be derived from unfunded public&#13;
investments while a portfolio of sub-projects with high levels of community participation and NGO&#13;
involvement are being identified.&#13;
C. Project Costs and Financing&#13;
2.4        The total Project cost is estimated at US$28 million equivalent, with a direct and indirect foreign&#13;
exchange component of about 20 percent. Since the volume of civil works sub-projects would be adjusted&#13;
according to available funds, price and physical contingencies have not been applied. The cost of material,&#13;
such as pipes for water supply, is not included in project costs as they already have or would be procured&#13;
under other arrangements. The first slice of the estimated investments have been identified at about US$5&#13;
million (Annex 1), which would be completed during the first 6-12 month period of the project.&#13;
2.5        The cost estimates are summarized in Table 2.1 below.&#13;

2.6        The estimate of the operational costs for the PMU  is based on:  (i) remuneration of staff&#13;
comparable to the private sector; and (ii) salary increases and other costs to be adjusted to the inflation. The&#13;
iocal and foreign inflation rates are shown in Table 2.2:&#13;

2.7      An IDA Credit would finance about 90 percent of total costs excluding duties and taxes. T!he&#13;
breakdowns are: (a) 100 percent of the costs for project management; (b) on an average, 90 percent of civil&#13;
works contracts for proposed sub-projects; (c) 100 percent of foreign  and local (ex-factory costs)&#13;
expenditures and for items to be procured locally 95 percent of expenditures (net of taxes) for goods and&#13;
equipment; and (d) 100 percent of services to be provided by individual consultants and consulting firms,&#13;
NGOs and auditing firms.&#13;
2.8      For sub-projects at an advanced stage of preparation, contracts are expected to be awarded with&#13;
expenditures to be incurred prior to Credit effectiveness, for which retroactive financing corresponding to&#13;
5 percent of the Credit amount, or US$1.25 million, is proposed. This would be in addition to an advance&#13;
under the Project Preparation Facility, up to an amount of US$1.5 million which has been approved to&#13;
cover expenditures, including civil works costs prior to Credit effectiveness. The breakdown of costs and&#13;
the financing plan are shown in Table 2.3. During negotiations, Government gave assurances that it would&#13;
finance the difference between the Project costs and the IDA Credit, estimated at US$3 million equivalent,&#13;
and that it would allocate the annual budget for the Project prior to February I each year for use by the&#13;
PMU as needed.&#13;

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Procurement&#13;
3.1      Procurement of goods and works would be in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits of January 1995 and revised January 1996. Procurement&#13;
of goods, which would be limited to vehicles and office equipment for the PMU and locally made school&#13;
furniture, could be procured according to national shopping for contract values of less than US$25,000 and&#13;
international shopping for contract values of less than US$50,000, with an aggregate amount of US$450,000&#13;
and US$250,000 respectively. National and international shopping should be based on at least three&#13;
quotations and, where relevant, from two countries.&#13;
3.2      The size of the civil works contracts would range from very small up to about US$250,000 to&#13;
be awarded according to national competitive bidding (NCB) following local procurement procedures. A&#13;
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) was recently completed, and with amendments as shown&#13;
under the Project Implementation Summary in the Project File, the NCB procedures were found to be&#13;
satisfactory. Conclusions reached are summarized as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Public Works Project                                                                         S&#13;
*   present system for classification of civil works contractors and restriction of bidding to&#13;
contractors in relevant categories of classification are acceptable to IDA;&#13;
*   contract amounts, where relevant, would be stated in US$ and, for payments to be made in&#13;
local currency, these would, for evaluation purposes, be converted at prevailing market rates&#13;
28 days prior to bid opening; and payments would be made according to the market rates;&#13;
and&#13;
*   standard bidding documents, issued in 1994 by the Ministry of Construction, Housing and&#13;
Urban Planning (MCHUP) would be applied as appropriate.&#13;
3.3      For sub-projects in rural and to a lesser extent in urban areas, which are feasible for&#13;
implementation by local communities or government agencies (e.g., municipalities), procedures under&#13;
community participation (para. 3.19) would be accepted. For contracts exceeding US$250,000, if any,&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB) should take place. Following local advertisement the PMU would&#13;
prepare a roster of potential local contractors including reference material, specializations and performance&#13;
records, which should be maintained and updated as needed.&#13;
3.4      Consultant services would be used for: (i) specific short-term assignments for the establishment&#13;
of the PMU and for annual progress and performance reviews; this would include foreign and local&#13;
consultants; and (ii) the preparation of sub-project reports, engineering design and tender documents, and&#13;
construction supervision; this would be carried out by local consultants (possibly through joint ventures with&#13;
foreign consultants), and NGOs. The consultant contracts would be in the range of US$20,000 to&#13;
US$300,000. The procedures for the invitation of consultant proposals with preparation of contract&#13;
agreements should be according to Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by&#13;
the World Bank as Executing Agency of August 1981. The PMU would prepare a roster of potential&#13;
consulting firms and NGOs, including reference material and information on specializations and performance&#13;
records, which should be maintained and updated as needed.&#13;
3.5      The PMU would be staffed by local recruitment. Staff selection would be done competitively.&#13;
The Project Director (PD) has already been appointed by the Steering Committee, on the basis of a short-list&#13;
of candidates. IDA was consulted on the appointment and gave its no objection. For other key PMU&#13;
positions, IDA has reviewed relevant job descriptions and qualification criteria, and interviewed suitable&#13;
candidates whose appointments will be subject to IDA approval. It would be acceptable for civil servants&#13;
to applv for the jobs, provided they leave their present employments to ensure their total integration in the&#13;
PMU management structure.&#13;
3.6      All consultant contracts and goods and works contracts, estimated to cost more than US$50,000,&#13;
as well as the first two contracts for goods and works regardless of value, would be subject to prior review&#13;
by IDA. This is expected to result in a prior review of about 70 percent of all IDA-financed contracts.&#13;
Given the preponderance of small contracts, this ratio is satisfactory. Of the remaining contracts, one in&#13;
four would be subject to random post review. To ensure proper application of the procurement procedures&#13;
under the Project, a procurement seminar was held in Sana'a in December 1995 and another one is scheduled&#13;
for late-1996.&#13;
&#13;

3.9       The project would be implemented over a four-year period, with a completion target date of&#13;
June 30, 2000. The Credit closing date is scheduled for October 31, 2000, four months following the Project&#13;
completion date. Although there are disbursement profiles for Yemen, these are not directly applicable to&#13;
the project which is different from those executed by sector ministries. The disbursement schedule is shown&#13;
in Annex 2 and summarized in Table 3.3 below. This should, however, be considered as tentative, since&#13;
project execution will be subject to the capacity of the PMU to prepare and implement sub-projects.&#13;

3.10     To tacilitate disbursements, the MPD would establish in the Central Bank a Special Account to&#13;
be operated by the SC/PMU under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. An initial deposit of US$1.0&#13;
million would be made to the Special Account and replenished, until US$2.0 million of disbursements have&#13;
been made, whereafter it would increase the deposit to US$2.0 million, corresponding to about 4 months'&#13;
expenditures. The PMU would submit replenishment applications for the Special Account on a monthly&#13;
basis, or when about half of the deposit has been utilized, whichever comes first. The minimum amount&#13;
for applications for direct payment and for special commitment would be 20 percent of the authorized&#13;
allocation to the Special Account. Disbursements would be made against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs)&#13;
for contracts for goods, works and services of less than US$50,000, for civil works under community&#13;
participation and for PMU operating costs.&#13;
C. Project Preparation and Implementation&#13;
3.11     Status of Proiect Preparation. The Council of Ministers has approved the project and issued a&#13;
decree for establishment of the Steering Committee and the PMU. In addition, the Government has formally&#13;
requested an advance of up to US$500,000 under the Project Preparation Facility to finance expenditures&#13;
for: (a) office facilities, equipment, vehicles and short-term consultant services for the establishment of the&#13;
PMU; (b) operating costs of the PMU; and (iii) consultant services to prepare sub-projects under the first&#13;
investment program and bring them to the stage of contracting. Subsequently, the Government made a&#13;
second request to increase the PPF advance by an additional US$1.0 million, which now aggregates to&#13;
US$1.5 million. This addition would cover the costs for initial civil works contracts.&#13;
3.12     The PMU is operational and its key staff have been appointed. An outline organizational and&#13;
staffing structure for the PMU is shown in Annex 3. The Staff Service Rules (SSR) have been prepared and&#13;
approved by the SC. The Manual of Procedures (MOP), which covers operational matter is currently being&#13;
finalized by a PMU consultant and will be submitted to the SC for approval. Outlines of table of contents&#13;
for the SSR and MOP are shown under the Project Implementation Summary in the Project File. Vehicles&#13;
and office equipment for the PMU are currently being procured. Sub-projects for the first investment&#13;
program have been identified and are being prepared by a PMU consultant in order for construction to start&#13;
no later than October, 1996. The first investment program is summarized in Annex 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                                                             Public Works Prooject&#13;
3.13     Investment programs, which will be prepared and approved on a quarterly basis, will include sub-&#13;
projects to be selected according to agreed criteria. These criteria, which are shown in Annex 4, take into&#13;
account:&#13;
*   the labor content (labor costs as a percentage of contract values); contracts to be financed&#13;
should be labor-intensive and comparatively small in size;&#13;
*   the impact on poverty alleviation regarding the extent to which sub-projects are located in&#13;
areas with above average poverty levels and/or unemployment rates;&#13;
*   the impact of improved infrastructure services;&#13;
n   the impact of improved environmental and sanitary conditions;&#13;
*   the degree of community involvement in the identification of sub-projects, and contributions&#13;
of the communities in cash or in labor; and&#13;
*   the ability of the beneficiaries to operate and maintain and to ensure sustainability of&#13;
completed works.&#13;
3.14     Project Management. Effective implementation of the project will require a project management&#13;
capacity, that will be able to serve a number of sectors and quickly respond to urgent requirements. This&#13;
would be achieved through the recently created SC and PMU, which would have: autonomous status; staff&#13;
appointed on contractual basis with remuneration comparable to the private sector; and their location in the&#13;
Ministry of Planning and Development (MPD) with the mandate to execute a multi-sectoral project. The&#13;
SC and the PMU will be regulated by the decree issued for their establishment, the Staff Service Rules and&#13;
the Manual of Procedures.&#13;
3.15     The Steering Committee2' is composed of six Government and three non-Government&#13;
representatives and chaired by the Minister of Planning and Development. The duties and functions of the&#13;
SC include: (a) approval of sub-project selection criteria, staff service rules and manual of procedures; (b)&#13;
sanction and termination of contracts for high level PMU staff, including the PD; (c) approval of annual&#13;
budgets for the operation of the PMU and investment programs; (d) review of quarterly and annual progress&#13;
reports and the performance of the PMU; (e) approval of contracts exceeding a value of US$200,000; and&#13;
(f) appointment of auditors and review of auditor's reports. During negotiations, assurances were given by&#13;
the Government that the membership of the Steering Committee and its terms of reference would be&#13;
satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
3.16     The PMU serves as the Secretariat to the SC. The PMU is headed by the Project Director, who&#13;
would be assisted by three managers -- one Financial and Administrative Manager, and two Area Managers,&#13;
responsible for the preparation and implementation of investment programs. The country has been divided&#13;
between two area managers for operational purposes. PMU staff would also include an investment planner,&#13;
a procurement specialist, a MIS specialist, an environmental specialist, and a part-time legal advisor.&#13;
Employment of the PMU staff would be governed by the SSR. which cover, inter alia, rules for&#13;
remuneration, conflict of interest, staff performance assessment and replacement of non-performing staff.&#13;
2/    The SC is composed of: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for MPD; Minister for Local&#13;
Administration; Minister for MCHUP: Minister for Social and Local Affairs; Director for Prime&#13;
Minister's office: Deputy Minister t6r MPD; and three non-Government members. two cf whon&#13;

During negotiations, assurances were given by the Government that no replacement of the PD would take&#13;
place and no appointments or replacements of key PMU staff would be made without prior consultation with&#13;
IDA.&#13;
3.17     The duties and functions of the PMU include: (a) preparation of investment programs, including&#13;
sub-projects to be based on established selection criteria; (b) appointment of consultants/NGOs for specific&#13;
assignments, for engineering and construction supervision and for works to be required under community&#13;
participation; (c) entering into contracts for goods and civil works with approval to be given for those with&#13;
a value of less than US$200,000; (d) carrying out of annual reviews with adjustments to be made in work&#13;
approach and procedures on the basis of experience gained; (e) coordination with government and non-&#13;
government authorities and financing agencies; (f) preparation of Staff Service Rules, sub-project selection&#13;
criteria and manual of procedures; (g) entering into and termination of contracts for support staff; and (h)&#13;
capacity building for the strengthening of local consulting and construction firms and NGOs and for&#13;
enhancing community participation.&#13;
3. 18    Proiect Implementation. The implementation schedule for the project is provided in Annex 5.&#13;
Sub-project proposals would be identified at the community/municipal levels in cooperation with NGOs,&#13;
sector ministries, the Governors' office and the PMU. The PMU would evaluate such proposals as a&#13;
continuous exercise and group them into quarterly investment programs, which are estimated to range in cost&#13;
between US$1-3 million, and to be executed within a 6- to 12-month period. In formulating the investment&#13;
programs, lessons of experience derived from execution of earlier sub-projects and annual&#13;
progress/performance reviews shall be applied as appropriate. Investment programis will be subject to review&#13;
and approval by the SC and IDA. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that each&#13;
investment program. including an environmental assessment, will be submitted to IDA for approval. The&#13;
MOP will describe the preparation and implementation of sub-projects for which a summary is also&#13;
provided in the Work Program (dated March 19, 1996), presented in the Project File. The Work Program&#13;
was agreed with the Government during negotiations.&#13;
3. 19    For the involvement of communities in the execution, operation and maintenance of sub-projects,&#13;
the support of NGOs would be essential. Therefore, the PMU would prepare, and present to IDA for&#13;
review, a strategy for a greater role for NGOs and community groups, and implement the strategy, including&#13;
organizing workshops and training courses. The strategy would also include recommendations for community&#13;
participation in procurement. It is expected that, as the project progresses, the Government would be able&#13;
to mobilize donor assistance to increase the level and scope of technical assistance for conmmunity and NGO&#13;
involvement.&#13;
3.20     The capacity of local consulting firms remains uncertain and would only be ascertained during&#13;
the course of project implementation. Some training would be provided by the PMU, and consulting firms&#13;
would have the possibility to recruit non-Yemeni staff or associate with foreign firms, with the costs to be&#13;
covered under respective consultant agreements with the PMU. Workshops would also be organized by the&#13;
PNIU, in cooperation with the Contractors' Association, to help small contractors better understand contract&#13;
documents and quality requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                                                         Public Works Project&#13;
D. Participatory Approach&#13;
3.21     The concept of the project emphasizes flexibility to ensure quick response; labor-intensive, small-&#13;
scale civil works that do not require long preparation and implementation periods; and participation of&#13;
communities and NGOs. The latter was influenced by the experience from other countries which indicates&#13;
that such goals could best be achieved through active community participation to be mobilized with the&#13;
support of NGOs. In Yemen, particularly in the rural areas. communities have traditionally participated in&#13;
civil works projects by contributing in cash or in kind. The Project builds on this tradition, but also includes&#13;
measures to involve support from a number of small NGOs, which have not to any larger degree, been&#13;
active in community-based civil works programs.&#13;
E. Project Monitoring&#13;
3.22     To ensure that the project meets its objectives, a set of performance indicators have been&#13;
developed (Annex 6). These indicators focus on the number of jobs created and relevant costs per work-&#13;
month. The PMU would establish a data base on unit costs for different works to be executed to enable a&#13;
comparison among sub-projects and a refinement of its cost estimates. The SC and IDA would monitor&#13;
project progress against these indicators on a quarterly basis, using the information obtained from the&#13;
quarterly reports to be prepared by the PMU.&#13;
3.23     The SC/PMU and IDA would appoint a consultant to carry out an annual performance review.&#13;
The findings and recommendations of the annual reviews would be discussed in workshops following the&#13;
review process, with the participation of the stakeholders. The annual reviews would focus on the scope&#13;
for improvements with specific proposals to be made regarding the functioning of the PMU and for the&#13;
preparation and implementation of investment programs. During negotiations, assurances were given by the&#13;
Government: (i) that quarterly progress reports including performance indicators would be submitted to IDA&#13;
for review within 30 days after the end of the reporting period; and (ii) that annual performance reviews&#13;
would take place each year during January with recommendations to be approved by the SC within one&#13;
month. The annual review for 1999 should also be considered as the mid-term review.&#13;
F. Project Supervision&#13;
3.24     Although the individual sub-projects are expected to be relatively simple, their country-wide&#13;
distribution and large numbers would make the overall implementation complex. Moreover, the preparation&#13;
of sub-projects with investment programs would be a continuous process during project implementation. This&#13;
would require intensive supervision, and consequently, IDA resources have been shifted from the normal&#13;
levels for preparation and appraisal towards implementation. The responsibility for project supervision&#13;
would be delegated to the Resident Mission (RM). Staff from headquarters would be involved particularly&#13;
in the annual reviews with an estimated annual input of about 10 staffweeks. The total input is estimated at&#13;
200 staffweeks.&#13;
G. Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting&#13;
3.25     The PMU, which is responsible for project budgeting and accounting, would keep separate&#13;
accounts for the operation of the PMU, for the use of consultant services, for civil works and other&#13;
contracts, and for the Special Account and Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). The PMU would install&#13;
appropriate accounting/budgetary and management information systems, and  for each year of project&#13;
implementation, prepare a budget for its operational costs and investment program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Public Works Project                                                                       11&#13;
3.26     The Borrower is not in compliance with IDA audit reporting covenants. This issue would be&#13;
discussed separately in the next Country Portfolio Performance Review with the Government. The PMU&#13;
would be subject to quarterly and annual audits by independent auditors in accordance with internationally&#13;
accepted standards. The audits would complement the annual performance review that would determine the&#13;
applicability of the procedures (as detailed in the MOP) and assess the overall performance of the PMU.&#13;
During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that auditors, acceptable to IDA, would be appointed&#13;
for a 4-year period; annual audit reports would be submitted within 6 months from the end of the reporting&#13;
period; quarterly interim audit reports would be submitted within 30 days following each quarter; and the&#13;
audit reports would include separate statements for the Special Account and SOEs.&#13;
H. Environmental Assessment&#13;
3.27     The proposed project has been classified as a category "B" project for the purpose of Operational&#13;
Directive 4.01. A review of the characteristics of potential sub-projects concludes that the overall&#13;
environmental impact would be positive. However, the environmental impact would vary among the sectors&#13;
and works to be executed. Special attention would be paid to sub-projects covering waste water, solid waste&#13;
disposal and storm water discharge.&#13;
3.28     Each sub-project report would assess the potential environmental impact of the works to be&#13;
undertaken and specify mitigative actions to be taken. During sub-project selection, any sub-project for&#13;
which the mitigative measures specified are not adequate to alleviate the adverse environmental impact would&#13;
be rejected. The PMU would prepare for each investment program a Summary Environmental Assessment&#13;
and include under its annual reviews relevant environmental aspects. The content of a Summary&#13;
Environmental Assessment is shown under the Project Implementation Summary in the Project File. To&#13;
ensure that environmental aspects of sub-projects are adequately addressed, the PMU would appoint an&#13;
environmental specialist to report directly to the PD.&#13;
I. Project Sustainability&#13;
3.29     Sub-projects, when completed, would be handed over to the sector ministries, NGOs and&#13;
communities for operation and maintenance. Long-term sustainability would thus be subject to the capacity&#13;
of these entities to maintain and operate the completed works. In the selection of sub-projects an assessment&#13;
would be made of expected future operational arrangements, and to what extent concurrent actions would&#13;
be taken on improvements in operational performance. Operational arrangements would also be reviewed&#13;
by IDA sector staff in the context of the development strategy being followed in the sector.&#13;
IV. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.       Benefits&#13;
4.1      The major project benefit refers to the number of jobs that are expected to be created. An&#13;
analysis of typical sub-projects for the first investment program (Annex 7) shows that each US$1 million&#13;
investment would generate jobs in the range of 2900 to 3800 work-months, assuming a distribution of&#13;
investments in urban/rural areas in the ratio 70/30 and a labor content in the range of 30-40 percent of&#13;
contract values. For the total project, this would correspond to an estimated 75,000 to 96,000 work-months&#13;
of employment at a cost of US$335 to US$260 per work-month. In addition, it is assumed that jobs to be&#13;
created indirectly, under various activities serving the construction industry, would correspond to about 40-&#13;
50 percent of those to be created directly. A sensitivity analysis would show that a change in the distribution&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                                           Public Works Project&#13;
of investments in urban/rural areas from 70/30 to 50/50 would increase the number of work-months by about&#13;
10-15 percent.&#13;
4.2       Apart fromjob creation, sub-projects will provide additional benefits from improved infrastructure&#13;
services, protection of the environment and better health and education facilities. These benefits would be&#13;
significant, but it is not cost-effective to evaluate them for every sub-project. The project will include high&#13;
priority, low investment sub-projects for rehabilitation of physical assets to increase their value and return&#13;
to full utilization. Because of the small size and diverse location of sub- projects, it is not cost-effective to&#13;
carry out formal economic analysis to estimate internal rates of return.&#13;
B.       Risks&#13;
4.3       Potential risks and actions taken or to be taken for their mitigation are:&#13;
(a)     maintaining a high labor content in sub-projects to be selected:&#13;
*   selection criteria have been agreed to that labor-intensive sub-projects are chosen; the&#13;
number of jobs to be created will be monitored as a performance indicator; and IDA in its&#13;
approval of investment programs will pay particular attention to the labor content;&#13;
(b)      developing a project implementation capacity through the establishment and operation of the&#13;
SC and the PMU, which would be funded as the executive arm of the SC:&#13;
PMU staff will be appointed on contract basis at a salary level comparative to the private&#13;
sector; IDA will review and approve all appointments; and provisions will be made for&#13;
annual performance evaluations and for the replacement of non-performing staff;&#13;
(c)      avoiding selection and financing of low priority sub-projects, or sub-projects that have been&#13;
initiated under various arrangements but not completed:&#13;
*   PMU is designed to be autonomous and have high quality staff, with review of its activities&#13;
by the SC, auditors and IDA staff;&#13;
(d)      maintaining an acceptable quality of works taking into account present competence and&#13;
availability of local consulting firms, NGOs and small scale contractors:&#13;
*   local consulting firms and NGOs can use non-Yemeni staff financed under their contract&#13;
agreements with PMU as needed; workshops and training sessions will be organized; and&#13;
specifications and quality requirements will be standardized and closely supervised; and&#13;
(e)      assuring sustainability of completed works:&#13;
*   this is taken into account in the selection criteria; NGOs would be developed to assist&#13;
communities in operation and maintenance; and concurrent actions are taken in different&#13;
sectors on improvements in operational performance in the course of other donor and IDA&#13;
operations;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Public Works Project                                                                       13&#13;
In addition, implementation performance, project quality and sustainability will be assessed annually, and&#13;
adjustments will be made in sub-project selection and design on the basis of experience gained. Also, for&#13;
IDA to better assist in project implementation, the main responsibility for project supervision will be&#13;
delegated to the Resident Mission, which will enable a faster response to potential problems.&#13;
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED&#13;
5.1      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:&#13;
(a) the Government of Yemen would finance the difference between project costs and the IDA&#13;
credit, estimated at US$3.0 million, and that the annual budgeted amount would be allocated&#13;
before February I for use by the PMU as needed (para. 2.8);&#13;
(b) the membership of the Steering Committee and its terms of reference would be satisfactory&#13;
to IDA (para. 3.15);&#13;
(c) the SC would not replace the Project Director or make any appointments or replacements&#13;
of key PMU staff without prior consultation with IDA (para. 3.16);&#13;
(d) the SC/PMU would submit each investment program including an environmental assessment&#13;
to IDA for approval (para. 3.18);&#13;
(e) the SC/PMU would submit to IDA for review, within 30 days after the end of the reporting&#13;
period, quarterly progress reports including performance indicators and would carry out&#13;
annual performance reviews each year during January with recommendations to be approved&#13;
by the SC within one month (para. 3.23); and&#13;
(f) the SC/PMU would appoint auditors acceptable to IDA for a 4-year period and submit&#13;
annual audit reports to IDA for review no later than 6 months after the end of the reporting&#13;
period, and quarterly interim audit reports within 30 days; the audit reports would include&#13;
separate statements for the Special Account and Statement of Expenditures (para. 3.26).&#13;
5.2      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of SDR17 million equivalent&#13;
to the Republic of Yemen at the IDA standard terms.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT&#13;
Sub-Project Selection Criteria&#13;
1.    The Public Works Project will cover a number of sub-projects in different sectors and dispersed&#13;
on a country-wide basis, which will be summarized under investment programs.  The investment&#13;
programs will be prepared taking into account: selection of sub-projects according to specific criteria;&#13;
the need for multi-sectoral coverage; and specific conditions for achieving a balanced geographical&#13;
distribution. These matters are addressed in the paragraphs below providing a further elaboration of the&#13;
overall project objectives, which are to:&#13;
-     create employment, particularly among the poverty groups;&#13;
-     deliver much needed infrastructure services;&#13;
-     improve environmental and sanitary conditions; and&#13;
-     promote community participation.&#13;
2.    The sub-project selection criteria address:&#13;
(a)   the labor content as a percentage of contract values, which should be in the range of 30-&#13;
40 percent and only less than 25 percent in exceptional cases. This implies:&#13;
-     the selection of works that, by nature, are labor intensive and contain a&#13;
low level of imported material; and&#13;
the preference of small contracts, where the use of special equipment is less&#13;
economical;&#13;
(b)   improvements in infrastructure services regarding:&#13;
number of beneficiaries and related investment costs per capita;&#13;
unit costs for different works to be executed with ceilings to be&#13;
established; and&#13;
assessment and comparison of benefits to be achieved;&#13;
(c)   improvements in environmental conditions regarding:&#13;
an assessment of the need for mitigative actions; and&#13;
rejection of sub-projects with an adverse environmental impact;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
(d)    degree of community (or stakeholder) involvement:&#13;
involvement in sub-project identification and preparation;&#13;
contribution (cash or labor) in works execution; and&#13;
responsibility for operation and maintenance;&#13;
(e)    poverty alleviation regarding:&#13;
extent to which sub-projects will be located in areas with above average poverty&#13;
levels and/or unemployment rates;&#13;
(f)    sustainability regarding:&#13;
-     extent to which proposed works form a part of a larger development program;&#13;
-     current and expected future arrangements for operation and maintenance; and&#13;
-     degree of cost recovery and need for recurrent budgetary allocations.&#13;
3.    For each sub-project a report, according to a standard format, will be prepared, which will&#13;
include an evaluation of the above criteria. These have also been summarized in a table format as shown&#13;
under Appendix 1. It is proposed that any sub-project with a rating of less than 50 (to be expressed as&#13;
a percentage of maximum score) should be excluded. The selection criteria will be reviewed annually,&#13;
taking into account the development and refinement of a data and information base, with adjustments to&#13;
be made as appropriate.&#13;
4.    In the composition of investment programs the Steering Committee should provide guidelines,&#13;
to be reviewed annually, on geographical distribution, coverage of different sectors, and balance between&#13;
urban and rural areas. In rural areas, community participation will be more predominant than in urban&#13;
areas, while in urban areas, because of higher population density, the investments per capita would be&#13;
less and a larger number of people can be reached. In some sectors, which would have a preference,&#13;
a larger labor input will be achieved because of the nature of works. The above considerations might&#13;
effect the sectoral and urban-versus-rural distribution of sub-projects, which will be reviewed for each&#13;
individual investment program.&#13;
5.    The thrust of the project should be job creation, with emphasis on unskilled workers, and thus&#13;
poverty alleviation, and therefore geographical areas with an above average poverty level and&#13;
unemployment rate should be targeted. On these matters information is rare, but some indications would&#13;
be provided through a poverty assessment, which is under preparation, and through needs assessments,&#13;
that will be prepared where justified. The information base will improve during the course of project&#13;
implementation, which will enable an increasing refinement in sub-project selection.&#13;

Reporting Systems and Perfornance Indicators&#13;
1.    Because of the large number of sub-projects dispersed throughout the country and to be implemented&#13;
during a short time-period, a well-developed project monitoring and reporting system will be critical to ensure&#13;
satisfactory project management. This should include:&#13;
(a)    project implementation schedules to cover one-year activities, to be updated quarterly, to&#13;
include:&#13;
-     preparation of sub-projects and investment programs;&#13;
-     processing and appointment of consultant/NGO services;&#13;
-     processing and implementation of goods and civil works contracts; and&#13;
-      any other events.&#13;
(b)    preparation of monthly progress reports for individual civil works contracts to be done by the&#13;
supervisory consultants. The reporting format, to cover information on physical works and&#13;
disbursements, should be finalized prior to the award of the first civil works contract.&#13;
(c)    performance indicators to be prepared for each investment program and to be consolidated&#13;
as an ongoing process for all investment programs.  The indicators should include&#13;
information on:&#13;
-     for individual contracts and for the investment program as a whole: the labor costs&#13;
as a percentage of contract costs; daily rates for skilled and unskilled workers; and&#13;
number of jobs created (in work-months) for skilled and unskilled workers;&#13;
-     unit costs for representative work components;&#13;
-      specific measurable benefits; and&#13;
-     disbursements.&#13;
For each investment program projections should be made regarding the above matters, which,&#13;
on a quarterly basis, should be compared with actual achievements.&#13;
(d)    preparation of quarterly and annual reports summarizing information under (a), (b) and (c).&#13;
These should be submitted to IDA for review within 30 days from the end of the reporting&#13;
period.&#13;
(e)    preparation of a roster for consulting firms, NGOs, and contractors with identification of&#13;
areas of competence. These should be updated as needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
2.    Annual performance reviews should take place each January/February (with the first one in 1997) to&#13;
cover:&#13;
(a)    overall functioning of the SC/PMU and performance and adequacy of the PMU staff;&#13;
(b)    adequacy and applicability of operational procedures;&#13;
(c)    overall performance in project implementation;&#13;
(d)    process of sub-project identification, including community and NGO participation, and&#13;
preparation of sub-project reports; and&#13;
(e)    performance of consultants, NGOs and contractors.&#13;
The annual review should focus on experience gained and conclude with the preparation of a proposal on&#13;
adjustments to be made. This should then be discussed in a workshop with the conclusions to be submitted,&#13;
within 2 weeks, to the SC for approval. In order to ensure independence, the annual review should be&#13;
prepared by an outside consultant, who should also be made responsible for organizing the workshop.&#13;
3.    In Appendix 1 projections have been made on a quarterly basis for 4 performance indicators - job&#13;
creation, cost per work-month, disbursements for civil works, and progress in project completion. These will&#13;
be included in the quarterly reporting system, reviewed and, if need be, updated annually.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT&#13;
Analysis of Labor Content under Typical Sub-Projects&#13;
1.    The primary objective under the project is to achieve under various sub-projects a high labor content&#13;
in order to optimize job creation. An analysis has been made for an investment package of US$1.0 million&#13;
as shown in Appendix 1. Assumptions made and conclusions reached are summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)    assumptions, based on local information, have been made regarding:&#13;
-      labor costs for unskilled/skilled/supervisory staff in urban and rural areas;&#13;
-     distribution of labor costs among relevant categories;&#13;
-      composition of the investment program in view of sectoral coverage and distribution&#13;
between urban/rural areas; and&#13;
-     direct and indirect labor content.&#13;
(b)    conclusions reached are:&#13;
-      the labor costs vary between different sectors and, in this case, average about 34%of&#13;
total civil works costs;&#13;
-     the number of work-days created is 70,900 which, at 22 working days per month,&#13;
corresponds to about 3,250 work-months;&#13;
-      indirect labor will increase the direct labor component with about 47 percent;&#13;
-     job creation through direct and indirect labor would then correspond to about 4,750&#13;
work-months; and&#13;
-     the costs for the creation of a work-month for direct and direct plus indirect labor&#13;
correspond to US$307 and US$210, respectively.&#13;
2.    An extrapolation of the above conclusions for the whole project could be summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)    because of expected variations in the composition of investment programs, the direct labor&#13;
content (labor costs as percentage of total costs) has been assumed to vary between 30 to 40&#13;
percent;&#13;
(b)    direct job creation in work-months (at projected investments of US$25.2 million in civil&#13;
works) would be in the range of 75,000 to 96,000; and for direct and indirect job creation&#13;
the number of work-months would be in the range of 106,000 to 141,000; and&#13;
(c)    for direct job creation the cost per work-month would be in the range of US$335 to US$260;&#13;
and for dirert and indirect job creation the cost per work-month would be in the range of&#13;
US$238 to US$179.&#13;
Job creation in work-months and relevant costs are included as monitoring indicators as shown under Annex&#13;
6.&#13;

            health and education; 2) development of a project management
            capability comprising a steering committee (SC) and a
            project management unit (PMU) to be funded as the executive
            arm of the SC; and 3) provision of technical assistance
            services for: (a) the establishment of the PMU; (b)
