Farm revival in Eastern and Central Europe&#13;
OmarRazzaz        Buying, selling, and mortgaging farmland are still rare in Eastern and Central Europe. Not&#13;
surprisingly, given the level of risk in many of these countries, short-term transactions, especially&#13;
leasing, are more common. These short-term transactions do almost as well as land sales in&#13;
allocating resources. Making them more secure by improving simple registration and enforcement&#13;
systems and increasing public access to information on what's for rent and at what price would do&#13;
much to help revive the farm sector.&#13;

            Buying, selling and mortgaging farmland
            are still rare in Eastern and Central Europe. Not
            surprisingly, given the level of risk in many of these
            countries, short-term transactions, especially leasing, are
            more common. These short-term transactions do almost as well
            as land sales in allocating resources. Making them more
            secure by improving simple registration and enforcement
            systems and increasing public access to information on what
            is for rent and at what price would do much help revive the
            farm sector.
