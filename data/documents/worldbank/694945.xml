ST. PETERSBURG CENTER CITY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   Renovation, rehabilitation and reanimation of the historic center is key to the&#13;
development of St. Petersburg as a whole. Although there are many beautiful buildings&#13;
and established infrastructure that could form a vibrant city, a number of factors are&#13;
inhibiting development. The major barriers to development include:&#13;
(a)   Poor and even dangerous, infrastructure&#13;
(b)   Complicated administrative processing procedures&#13;
(c)   Inadequate incentive framework for the private sector&#13;
(d)   The difficulty of vacating existing buildings so they can be reconstructed&#13;
(e)   The high costs of renovation&#13;
(f)   Insufficient information available for developers and the public&#13;
1.2   While addressing any one of these barriers will lead to some improvement in the&#13;
development climate, the city needs to have a coordinated approach to all of them in&#13;
order to realize its potential.&#13;
1.3   At the moment, however, the city does not have a realistic strategy that will help it&#13;
achieve its goals. The federal government and the city have finalized a major federal/ City&#13;
program entitled the Federally Targeted Program for Preservation and Renovation of the&#13;
Historic Areas of St. Petersburg (FTP). However, the program cannot be implemented&#13;
due to a lack of priorities, detailed plans and funds.&#13;
1.4   The city recognizes that a strategy is needed that relies heavily on the initiatives of&#13;
the emerging private sector. They have started work on formulating a strategic plan. The&#13;
project will help the city finalize the strategic plan and launch its implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
1.5    This project should be considered the first in a series of projects that could be&#13;
supported in the future by the Bank, other donors, and the private sector. The project will&#13;
provide assistance to the city in: (i) finalizing the strategic plan; (ii) developing the&#13;
institutions and regulations that will be required to carry out the plan; (iii) carrying out&#13;
detailed plans, designs anc. engineering for a future investment project that the Bank or&#13;
other institutions could support; and (iv) implementing pilot schemes to test new&#13;
approaches, including a pilot cultural fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
St. Petersburg Center City Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
2. THE PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT CONCEPT&#13;
2.1   The project is designed to increase the capacity to carry out a larger program of&#13;
center city rehabilitation. The project will support a process of reform, restructuring, and&#13;
investment in St. Petersburg. The process will include strategic planning, designing,&#13;
engineering, promoting, regulating, building capacity, piloting, and learning from&#13;
experience. The lessons learned will modify the plan and initiate a larger effort in the&#13;
future.&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.2   The goal of the project is to support preparation of a realistic St. Petersburg&#13;
Center City Rehabilitation Program. Specific objectives are to: (a) further develop and&#13;
agree with the city and Federal authorities on a strategic plan and a city investment&#13;
program for center city rehabilitation; (b) continue regulatory reform to assure&#13;
competitive real estate markets and a competitive business environment in the center city;&#13;
(c) initiate a program of public information and participation in the decision making&#13;
process for city development and investment; (d) carry out some visible physical&#13;
improvements that can be replicated on a larger scale in the future, and (e) assist cultural&#13;
organizations in the city to improve their ability to generate non-budget revenue.&#13;
PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
2.3   Summary. The project would provide a comprehensive package of studies,&#13;
designs, regulatory reform, capacity building and pilots to permit implementation of the&#13;
investment program. Specific components include:&#13;
(a)   Technical Cooperation will assist the city in planning and managing the&#13;
initiation of a major program of center city rehabilitation. The Technical&#13;
Cooperation component has two subcomponents: (a) planning,&#13;
Monitoring indicators are listed in Chapter 3, Institutional Setting, Regulation and Implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
administration and engineering, and (b) institution building and regulatory&#13;
reform.2&#13;
(b)   Pilot Schemes to experiment with and demonstrate new mechanisms for&#13;
providing traditional services or new or improved services. Specific plans&#13;
include pilot schemes that will provide some physical improvements (e.g.,&#13;
sidewalks, street lighting, landscaping, signage) for the whole of Nevsky&#13;
Prospekt (the main commercial street in St. Petersburg), and more&#13;
concentrated improvements in smaller areas adjacent to and near Nevsky&#13;
that demonstrate high potential for commercial development. These&#13;
improvements would include infrastructure, streetscape, and social&#13;
assistance. The improvements would be combined with the market-based&#13;
sale of vacant buildings and land; creation of new privately owned or&#13;
leased commercial space, new ways of operating facilities; and increased&#13;
charges to commercial users and residents for services. In addition, pilot&#13;
schemes would try to use the resources already available through the&#13;
ongoing Housing (RU 3850) and Energy Efficiency (RU 3876) Projects to&#13;
provide incentives for rehabilitation of existing apartments and to increase&#13;
energy efficiency.&#13;
TECHNICAL COOPERATION&#13;
2.4    Administration, Planning and Engineering. Three subcomponents are&#13;
included in administration, planning and engineering: (a) Support for the Project&#13;
Implementation Unit (PIU); (b) research and analysis by the Leontieff Center; and (c)&#13;
work performed by a General Consultant.&#13;
2.5   Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The project will be coordinated,&#13;
implemented and supervised by the PIU, a foundation established by the city for this&#13;
purpose. The city will contract with the PIU to provide essential administrative services.&#13;
The PIU will serve as the intermediary level between the city government and the&#13;
General Consultant. The PIU has a small staff, as most of the day-to-day work on the&#13;
project will be handled by the General Consultant. Because the current project is designed&#13;
to be the first step in a much larger St. Petersburg program, the city should eventually&#13;
establish a major foundation with responsibility for center city rehabilitation including&#13;
implementation of the FTP. Such a foundation should have representation by major&#13;
stakeholders on the board. Since establishing such a foundation will require time, an&#13;
interim Foundation has been designated by the city to implement the project until the&#13;
larger Foundation can be established.&#13;
2 In addition, donor finance would be used to carry out complementary technical assistance, including (i)&#13;
development of a strategic plan for the whole of St. Petersburg ; (ii) recommendations for improving the&#13;
process for issuing development permits; (iii) cadastre work; (iv) analysis of center city utility&#13;
requirements; and (v) municipal finance work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
2.6   Data and Analysis (Leontieff Center). Research and analysis for the project will&#13;
be provided by the International Center for Social and Economic Research "Leontieff&#13;
Center," a non-profit state company founded in 1991 on the initiative of the Mayor of St.&#13;
Petersburg and the Petersburg-born economist and Nobel Prize Laureate, Wassily&#13;
Leontieff. The Center has served as the chief research and data analysis organization for&#13;
the city for many years. Center research staff have access to essential data not otherwise&#13;
available and are uniquely qualified to provide the required analysis. The Center has&#13;
successfully undertaken similar assignments for the borrower. The Center will assist the&#13;
General Consultant in its planning activities. The particular tasks will be determined by&#13;
the consultant and the Center with the approval of the city and the World Bank.&#13;
Approximately 200 person months of assistance are expected to be available. Tasks are&#13;
expected to include the following:&#13;
*  Determining the need for additional data for project implementation based on&#13;
a review of the work funded by bilateral donors described above as well as&#13;
collecting data.&#13;
*  Using the Strategic Plan for the entire city of St. Petersburg to develop a land&#13;
use, transport, cultural and economic plan for the central city area that reflects&#13;
the role of the center city in the city economy.&#13;
* Providing background information on the Federally Targeted Program for the&#13;
"Historical Preservation of the St. Petersburg Center City" and working with&#13;
city and federal agencies to coordinate the project activities with this&#13;
program.&#13;
*  Providing information on work done to date and current planning activities.&#13;
*  Organizing discussions and other communications with appropriate city&#13;
committees and with the appropriate ministries of the federal government.&#13;
*  Providing information on local conditions to help ensure that the plans will&#13;
be useful to both the city and the Federal Government in implementing the&#13;
Federally Targeted Program.&#13;
2.7   General Consultancy. The city would enter into a major consultant contract to&#13;
help manage the current project and plan future efforts in center city rehabilitation.&#13;
Consultants will assist the city and federal government to:&#13;
(a)   Provide all administrative support necessary to manage and implement this&#13;
project, including the construction management of pilot projects,&#13;
monitoring project progress, carrying out continuous social and&#13;
environmental assessments and assisting in stakeholder consultations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
(b)    Finalize an implementable strategy for Center City rehabilitation; such a&#13;
strategy will encompass the FTP and build upon the strategic plan for the&#13;
whole of St. Petersburg.3&#13;
(c)    Prepare detailed plans for follow on projects of about US$300 million,&#13;
including:&#13;
* assisting in identifying and defining the efforts to be supported.&#13;
* completing all studies necessary for approval of the projects by the&#13;
Bank and/or other donors.&#13;
*   completing detailed designs, engineering and procurement documents&#13;
for the first eighteen months of construction of the follow on projects&#13;
*   developing and implementing a simplified GIS system for the center&#13;
city area.&#13;
*   preparing plans and terms of reference for developing the institutional&#13;
framework necessary for the development of the center city.&#13;
*   developing detailed relocation policies and plans&#13;
2.8    The project will support preparation of much larger follow on projects, The range&#13;
of sectors reviewed will be comprehensive, including all of the infrastructure networks,&#13;
housing, historic preservation, and economic, social, and environmental development.&#13;
Realistically, the only way that the Government can prepare the follow-on project(s)&#13;
rapidly is by hiring experienced consultants. Design and engineering have been included&#13;
as part of the work of the General Consultant.&#13;
2.9    Terms of reference for the General Consultancy are attached in Annex 6. The&#13;
Government of St. Petersburg has approved these terms of reference and proposed a short&#13;
list of consultants who have submitted proposals. The proposals are being evaluated. All&#13;
the firms on the proposed short list are joint ventures between major international firms&#13;
and Russian firms. Hiring of the General Consultant is a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
2.10 Institution Building and Regulatory Reform. The project will support&#13;
institutional development in appropriate government departments and will continue&#13;
support for regulatory reform by financing a local organization to deepen on-going work&#13;
on city economic strategies and on legislative reform&#13;
2.11  Institutional Strengthening. Many Governmental departments will participate in&#13;
the rehabilitation and revitalization of the center city. Although most of these&#13;
departments have existed for some time, they need to upgrade their human resource&#13;
skills, procedures, and equipment, in order to do an effective and efficient job in a market&#13;
economy. A detailed needs assessment has been prepared. Examples of some of the&#13;
International and local consultants have mobilized for the strategic plan and are planning a stakeholder's&#13;
conference. Financing for the strategic plan is being provided through a US$1.5 million grant from&#13;
USAID. Terms of reference for the strategic planning work are in Annex 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
specific needs include assistance: (i) to the Architecture Committee with GIS systems and&#13;
other electronic planning tools and with land use tools and regulation such as zoning; (ii)&#13;
to both the Architecture Committee and the Directorate on Historic Monuments on&#13;
technical rules of historic preservation and procedures for approving preservation&#13;
projects; (iii) to the Finance Committee on budgeting, utility pricing, and real estate&#13;
taxation to complement efforts funded by EBRD and EU TACIS; and (iv) to the Land&#13;
Committee for further development of the title registration system;4 and (v) to the&#13;
Culture Committee to promote the tourism industry. The Government would like to use&#13;
grant assistance from donors to the maximum extent; and the Bank project team has&#13;
provided information to donors on needed activities of institutional development. The&#13;
loan would be used to provide specific technical assistance to city departments and&#13;
agencies, including the purchase of equipment, in cases where high priority requirements&#13;
cannot be met with grant assistance. The General Consultant would assist the city in&#13;
evaluating priorities for the use of this support and in drawing up technical documents to&#13;
facilitate these purchases.&#13;
2.12 Regulatory Reform: St. Petersburg Foundation for Development of the Real&#13;
Estate Sector. The Foundation for Development of the City Real Estate Market is a non-&#13;
budgetary organization created on the initiative of the City Real Estate Commission and&#13;
delegated the responsibility to prepare legislation dealing with a wide range of urban&#13;
issues. Foundation staff are uniquely qualified to draft legislation required for project&#13;
implementation. The Foundation has successfully undertaken similar assignments for the&#13;
borrower. The Foundation is also the only formal organization with a membership that&#13;
includes major stakeholders. Many private organizations from the city's development&#13;
community, as well as industry professionals, are represented on the Foundation's&#13;
advisory board. The Foundation has prepared an ambitious legislative agenda but has&#13;
limited resources at this time. The Bank loan would be used to support the costs&#13;
associated with training, drafting of materials, and services to help implement this&#13;
agenda. This includes work on the following and other regulatory acts:&#13;
*  City Planning Code of St. Petersburg&#13;
*  Law on Investment in Real Estate in St. Petersburg&#13;
*  On Real Property Management by [Private Sector] Management Companies&#13;
*  Law on Investment Tax Credits&#13;
*  The Land Code of St. Petersburg&#13;
*  The Land Fee Code&#13;
*  Law on Infrastructure Connection Fees and Charges&#13;
*  On Sublease of Land Parcels&#13;
4The Government of Sweden has indicated that it would be willing to expand previous assistance on tax&#13;
mapping and titling to cover the entire center city.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
PILOT INVESTMENT SCHEMES5&#13;
2.13   Purpose. The purpose of pilot projects is to experiment with and demonstrate&#13;
new mechanisms for providing traditional services or new or improved services.&#13;
Specifically, such projects would: (i) deliver new products or technology; (ii) mobilize&#13;
the people and/or the private sector in new ways; (iii) develop new policy and financial&#13;
mechanisms; and (iv) test improved implementation capacity (better operations, new&#13;
techniques, higher level of activity).&#13;
2.14 Sub-components. The following pilot sub-components would be implemented.&#13;
2.15 Nevsky Prospekt Upgrading. Nevsky Prospekt is the main shopping, tourist, and&#13;
commercial artery of St. Petersburg. It has extremely high volumes of pedestrian and&#13;
vehicular traffic, and connects many of the major museums, theaters, and tourist sites. It&#13;
is the heart of the city, and provides an anchor for all of the city's activities. The city and&#13;
its stakeholders consider the visible improvement of the corridor to be vital to the&#13;
rehabilitation of the city as a whole. Therefore, a series of relatively low cost investments&#13;
have been planned to provide noticeable improvements along Nevsky Prospekt. These&#13;
include the following:&#13;
(a)   Street Lighting. Due to severe corrosion and deterioration, the existing&#13;
cast-iron light posts on Nevsky Prospekt, dating back to the beginning of&#13;
the century, pose a hazard to pedestrians. To date, several incidents of&#13;
post failure have been recorded, some resulting in injuries. This pilot&#13;
scheme will replace the aging posts with historically appropriate lamp&#13;
posts, including the use of more energy efficient lamps. This will provide&#13;
better illumination, especially needed in this northern city with its long&#13;
nights during the winter.&#13;
(b)   Streetscape. Existing sidewalks, which are pockmarked asphalt pathways,&#13;
would be replaced with attractive paving offering handicapped access at&#13;
street corners. Landscaping and signage would be improved.&#13;
(c)   Smaller projects. Provision has been made for the inclusion of smaller&#13;
projects along and adjacent to Nevsky Prospekt that would benefit the&#13;
city's economic development and historic rehabilitation. Thus far,&#13;
smaller projects that have been identified include boat landings for tourist&#13;
boats on canals and floating restaurants, and refurbishing a pedestrian&#13;
underpass. Individual projects would be smaller than US$500,000&#13;
equivalent and would be appraised by Bank missions.&#13;
This section describes the pilot schemes; cost recovery, economic justification and risk are evaluated in&#13;
Chapter 5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
(d)   Infrastructure to service a vacant site. There are a few well located&#13;
vacant sites in the center city that offer high commercial potential.&#13;
Infrastructure (e.g., connections to the city networks) would be provided to&#13;
one of these sites, along with planning documentation. The site would&#13;
then be auctioned to private developers. Including this site would give the&#13;
city experience in developing documentation and in better understanding&#13;
the allocation of responsibilities between the public and private sectors.&#13;
2.16  Special Housing Fund. With the exception of a relatively small number of vacant&#13;
buildings, most buildings in need of significant rehabilitation in the center of St. Petersburg&#13;
are occupied by residential tenants of social housing. Buildings must be vacated in order to&#13;
carry out physical rehabilitation and to restructure their existing spaces, and to provide a&#13;
sufficient return on private investment. Most existing residents are eager to move to an&#13;
individual apartment; in fact, many have been on the waiting list for many years; however,&#13;
they lack the means to purchase an apartment. The city's preferred approach to vacating&#13;
buildings is through voluntary agreements reached between occupants and private&#13;
developers to which the rights of rehabilitation have been delegated; however, developers&#13;
often lack the capital to both plan a rehabilitationproject and provide for relocation, and&#13;
sources of financing are simply not available. The Special Housing Fund will be a&#13;
revolving fund used to make loans to redevelopers of targeted buildings. Such loans would&#13;
help redevelopers purchase alternative apartments for existing residents that agree&#13;
voluntarily with redevelopers to move. Opening of the Special Housing Fund account is a&#13;
condition of disbursement.&#13;
2.17  The Fund would be administeredby an agency of the City or by an independent&#13;
financial institution under contract to the city and would provide relatively small (US$5,000&#13;
-US$35,000 equivalent) short term loans. Social workers and an ombudsman would be&#13;
made available to tenants to answer questions and bring their concerns to the attention of&#13;
city officials and developers. To provide the maximum protection for tenants, the city has&#13;
agreed to a number of conditions and covenants described below. Loans would be made&#13;
available on the following terms:&#13;
* Loans would be made only in connection with targeted building rehabilitation&#13;
projects for which a contract of disposition and rehabilitation has been&#13;
entered into between the City and a developer.&#13;
*  Loans would be made for up to a specified percentage, to be determined, of&#13;
the actual cost of relocating each residential tenant or owner in the building to&#13;
a residential dwelling meeting the City's standards for habitability and living&#13;
space per person. Bank disbursements would be limited to relocation costs,&#13;
including the costs of newly constructed apartments, and legal, administrative&#13;
and moving expenses resulting from relocation.6 Loans would not exceed an&#13;
The Bank's Articles of Agreement do not permit Bank financing to be used for transferring existing&#13;
assets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
absolute amount, to be determined by the city with approval by the Bank, per&#13;
tenant or owner.&#13;
*   Loans will not be made until agreements of relocation have been made with a&#13;
specified percentage, to be determined, of the tenants or owners occupying&#13;
the building.&#13;
*  Loans will be disbursed only upon submission to the city of contracts of sale&#13;
or other documentation satisfactory to the city for purchase and sale of (a) the&#13;
space to be acquired from the present tenant or owner, and (b) the space to&#13;
which the present tenant or owner is to be relocated. In the case of owners,&#13;
the city will accept a contract of sale of the apartment to be acquired by the&#13;
developer provided that the selling tenant or owner agrees to be responsible&#13;
for his own relocation needs.&#13;
*  Building redevelopers would be obligated to seek commercial financing once&#13;
a building has been vacated. Loans will be repaid to the City upon the earlier&#13;
of: obtaining financing from a commercial lender; sale or lease of the&#13;
rehabilitated apartment; or an outside date, to be determined, from the date&#13;
the loan is made.&#13;
*  Loans will be secured by a mortgage on the apartment to be rehabilitated,&#13;
which would be released upon sale of the rehabilitated apartment.&#13;
*  Loans will bear interest at a rate which will allow repayment of the World&#13;
Bank debt, establish reasonable reserves against losses, compensate the city&#13;
for its costs of administering the program, and relate to a rate of interest&#13;
prevailing in the market.&#13;
2.18  The City has agreed to adopt a Housing Fund Operational Manual acceptable to&#13;
the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Construction and the Bank incorporating all of&#13;
the principles in para 2.17 above. The transmittal of this manual to the Bank is a&#13;
condition of disbursement.&#13;
2.19  The city also has agreed that not later than three months prior to the&#13;
commencement of activities under the Special Housing Fund, the City shall furnish to&#13;
the Bank a policy statement defining principles and procedures applicable to the&#13;
relocation of residents. from buildings requiring maior rehabilitation in the center of the&#13;
city to be financed by the Special Housing Fund.&#13;
2.20 Block 130 Public Improvements. In December 1995, the city and Bank jointly&#13;
sponsored a meeting of stakeholders to discuss center city rehabilitation. The&#13;
stakeholders, which included a mix of investors, professionals, local organizations, city&#13;
employees, and donors broke into small working groups. After analysis and deliberation,&#13;
the stakeholders decided that Block 130 would be the best area in which to carry out&#13;
concentrated pilot schemes. It was selected because of its central location (along Nevsky&#13;
Prospekt, the main commercial street of St. Petersburg), the poor physical condition of its&#13;
infrastructure and open areas, the wide mixture of existing uses, and its high potential for&#13;
commercial and residential development. The block is representative of many of the&#13;
problems of the central area. Rehabilitation of the block would provide visible&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II&#13;
improvements important for the whole city. Moreover, the techniques and methods used&#13;
by the city in the planning and rehabilitation of Block 130 would serve as useful&#13;
prototypes for the rehabilitation of the entire central area. The Block was studied&#13;
intensively during the preparation of the project with the support of USAID, the Finnish&#13;
Government, and the City of St. Petersburg. Specific studies included a comprehensive&#13;
architectural, planning, design, sociological, financial, and economic studies; and a&#13;
special study of zoning. Based on the work completed, the Bank loan would support the&#13;
following physical components.&#13;
2.21 Pedestrian Mall. A new pedestrian walkway and retail shopping mall would be&#13;
constructed to 250 meters through the currently impenetrable heart of one of the largest&#13;
blocks in the City Center, providing access across the block and through courtyard&#13;
passageways to Nevsky Prospekt. The pedestrian mall will replace a jumble of&#13;
underutilized buildings, yards, and an obsolete heating plant. The pedestrian street would&#13;
be in harmony with the historic surroundings and would include landscaping, cobbling,&#13;
and paving. Space on the mall would be leased to businesses that would erect two story&#13;
pavilions for retail activities. It would lead to the open areas that are a remnant of the&#13;
former Italian Gardens in the middle of the block adjacent to a school and hospital. The&#13;
completion of the component will require the resettlement of about 28 persons from a&#13;
severely dilapidated building in accordance with practices acceptable to the Bank.7 The&#13;
City has agreed that any involuntar relocation that results from Bank-financed works&#13;
would be carried out in accordance with policies and practices acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
The city will also nreRare a resettlement plan based on the guidelines agreed with the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
2.22 Heating System. Building the pedestrian mall will require that an existing&#13;
antiquated heating plant be demolished. A new heating system will be erected that&#13;
consists of two new small, modular gas fired boiler plants (5.5MW and 8.5MW) to&#13;
supply heat for the block. The corroded sections of the internal heat distribution as well as&#13;
the above ground sections would be replaced with new, modern, preinsulated heating&#13;
pipes and the above ground sections would be replaced (approximately 2.5 km of network&#13;
in total). The city plans to contract through a competitive procedure for the operation of&#13;
this new facility.&#13;
2.23 Soil Removal. The environmental analysis of Block 130 showed high levels of&#13;
contamination by heavy metals, including mercury, cadmium and zinc. Although&#13;
relatively high levels of heavy metal soil contamination are typical for the whole of the&#13;
historic center, the levels in Block 130 have tested to be twice as high as the average and&#13;
Bank procedures do not require a formal relocation plan for so few people, however, the relocation&#13;
procedures were agreed at negotiations and are reflected in the supplemental letter to the Loan Agreement.&#13;
The city's policy is to reach voluntary agreement with tenants. If voluntary agreement is not possible, the&#13;
city must offer at least three alternative individual apartments that meet norms in terms of space and&#13;
amenities. All of the alternatives would be more spacious and have better amenities than the present&#13;
communal apartment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
are classified by Russian standards as dangerous and extremely dangerous. Therefore,&#13;
the pilot project will include the removal of the soil in open spaces on the whole of the&#13;
site, as well as the replacement with uncontaminated soil and landscaping.&#13;
2.24 Elderly Housing. Some 35% of the existing residents of the central city (and&#13;
23% of residents of the block) are elderly, most living in communal apartments in&#13;
dilapidated buildings. They are the most vulnerable of residents; most live on small fixed&#13;
incomes, and moving away from their existing neighborhood in order to improve their&#13;
housing conditions would pose special hardships. Because land values in the center are&#13;
high, relocating elderly residents of existing apartments in the center would not be&#13;
attractive for private developers. Therefore, this component will provide funds for&#13;
construction or rehabilitation of a building housing approximately 200 elderly persons&#13;
relocating from communal apartments. Construction costs must be competitive with&#13;
prices in the secondary market for modest apartments, since developers are expected to&#13;
provide funds to existing residents that will permit their purchase. This would imply a&#13;
subsidy for the opportunity cost of the land, but no direct financial subsidy on the part of&#13;
the city.8 The city has agreed to submit detailed plans acceptable to the Bank before the&#13;
component is implemented covering disposal of units, recovery of costs, building&#13;
operations and recurrent cost financing. and monitoring the continued operation and use&#13;
of the buildinz.&#13;
2.25   Kapella Courtyards. The City prepared a pilot scheme to provide infrastructure to&#13;
a series of courtyards near the Winter Palace that are already used as an informal&#13;
passageway. Some historically important buildings adjoining the courtyards would be&#13;
auctioned to the private sector for major rehabilitation and provision of commercial space&#13;
on the ground floor; while some remaining spaces would be improved for the current&#13;
building occupant, which is a major musical organization. The pilot would demonstrate&#13;
an interesting way of revitalizing cultural assets and supporting commercial activities,&#13;
while providing financial benefits to the City.&#13;
2.26   The City plans to renovate the public spaces in the courtyards by improving&#13;
infrastructure, paving, landscaping; and installing upgraded lights, advertising standards,&#13;
railings, and street furniture. They envisage the courtyards themselves as a locale for&#13;
open concerts, outdoor cafes, recreational areas, and flower and souvenir kiosks. The&#13;
first floors of the buildings would house stores, cafes, restaurants, exhibition halls, and&#13;
public restrooms. Bank financing has been requested for infrastructure, while private&#13;
financing would be sought for renovation of two buildings into hotels and for renovation&#13;
of first floor spaces for commercial activities. One of the hotels would be a modest hotel&#13;
that would contain facilities (studios, practice rooms etc.) for visiting musicians. The city&#13;
plans to auction development rights to private investors for the two buildings through&#13;
The average cost of construction for modest units is US$425/M2, while the sales price of similar units on&#13;
the secondary market is US$475. This would provide a 21% financial rate of return for the city's&#13;
investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
competitive procedures. Although the city would like to facilitate the upgrading of all of&#13;
the buildings on the courtyards over time, it may take a number of years for the market to&#13;
absorb this development; and the financial and economic analysis of the project is&#13;
predicated on auctioning only two buildings and re-leasing some commercial space. The&#13;
completion of the component will require the relocation of about 18 persons from the first&#13;
floors of buildings to be rehabilitated in accordance with practices acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.9 The City has agreed that any involuntary relocation that results from Bank-&#13;
financed works would be carried out in accordance with policies and practices acceptable&#13;
to the Bank. A resettlement action plan is a condition of disbursement.&#13;
2.27  Cultural Fund. The objective of the fund is to assist the major federally owned&#13;
cultural organizations in St. Petersburg to improve their ability to generate non-budgetary&#13;
revenue. The fund would be used to make grants to the 11 major federally supported&#13;
major cultural organizations of St. Petersburg. Grants would be used for small&#13;
subprojects that either: a) provide facilities and/or equipment needed to improve their&#13;
non-budgetary revenue generating capabilities; or b) provide operational improvements to&#13;
improve the financial and/or administrative management of the organization.&#13;
2.28 The fund would be operated by the Foundation for Housing Reform, a Moscow-&#13;
based Foundation that is charged with responsibility for the Russian Federation Housing&#13;
Project, the proposed Water Supply and Sewerage project, the Federally Targeted&#13;
Program for Renovation of the historic areas of St. Petersburg, and the federally related&#13;
activities of the St. Petersburg Center City Rehabilitation Project. A staff member is&#13;
already in place who would be charged with responsibility for the fund. Technical&#13;
appraisal of grant requests by qualified experts would be required. Decisions on each&#13;
grant would be made by an advisory committee to be formed with representation from the&#13;
Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Finance, and other Governmental and non-&#13;
Governmental organizations that are knowledgeable about cultural needs. Establishment&#13;
of the Inter-Ministerial Grant Approval committee is a condition of disbursement.&#13;
Adoption of an Operating Manual acceptable to the Bank is a condition of disbursement.&#13;

Technical Annex&#13;
3. INSTITUTIONAL SETTING, REGULATION AND&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
STRUCTURE OF ST. PETERSBURG GOVERNMENT&#13;
3.1   The constitution of the Russian Federation provides St. Petersburg with regional&#13;
status as a "Subject of the Federation." Legislative power is carried out by a Legislative&#13;
Assembly of 49 deputies. Executive power is held by the elected Governor of St.&#13;
Petersburg and by the St. Petersburg Government. The Government operates through a&#13;
series of Committees and Departments that report to specific deputy governors serving at&#13;
the pleasure of the governor. In addition, there are 20 city districts that provide services&#13;
through district administrations to the population. In 1994, five former districts in the&#13;
historic center were regrouped into two (Tsentralnii and Admiralteiskii) in order to&#13;
streamline management and cut costs. The organizational structure and functions of the&#13;
committees and departments are available in the project files.&#13;
FINANCES OF ST. PETERSBURG GOVERNMENT&#13;
3.2   The City government is a large organization with complex responsibilities. While&#13;
all Russian cities depend in significant ways on the actions of the federal government, St.&#13;
Petersburg's status as a Subject of the Federation provides it with more latitude than other&#13;
cities (except for Moscow). For example, St. Petersburg may issue municipal debt and it&#13;
does not report to a regional government. As is the case for nearly all Russian cities, St.&#13;
Petersburg is facing financial problems as the result of the changes taking place in the&#13;
Russian economy and systems of government and taxation over the past several years.&#13;
Financial deficits for 1995 were US$186 million equivalent and budgeted deficits for&#13;
1996 are US$532 million equivalent' compared to revenues of US$2.2 billion equivalent.&#13;
Debt is short term and rising. As of September 1, 1996, loan debt was about US$500&#13;
million equivalent. This is in addition to accounts payable, which were equal to three&#13;
months of expenditures at the beginning of 1996.&#13;
3.3   The city is addressing its financial problems, and the situation is likely to improve&#13;
over the next several years. The city is preparing a balanced budget for 1997. The&#13;
However, it is likely that the city will make expenditure adjustments to reduce this deficit before the end&#13;
of 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
governor issued a forty four point program to improve the city's revenues and to reduce&#13;
expenditures. This program required that city departments and committees complete and&#13;
submit a number of reports and draft legislation before the end of 1996. The governor's&#13;
program covers every aspect of revenues - taxes, leases, user charges and gambling. The&#13;
changes are expected to result in increased revenue of 1,020 billion rubles a year (almost&#13;
US$200 million).&#13;
3.4   The EBRD has provided significant help to the city in evaluating its financial&#13;
position. Under the EBRD program a number of task forces have been formed to help&#13;
develop plans for controlling expenditures. The Know How Fund has worked in close&#13;
cooperation with the EBRD program to introduce concepts of cash flow and debt&#13;
planning. International investment banks have also been working with the city to prepare&#13;
it to issue bonds on the international market. The Bank has closely coordinated the&#13;
preparation of this project with EBRD to assure that the two initiatives are compatible&#13;
and support each other.&#13;
3.5   Because the city's financial position is very weak, the city administration and the&#13;
federal government have insisted that the investments supported by Bank loans (including&#13;
this project and the St. Petersburg component of the Housing Project) provide for cost&#13;
recovery and loan repayment. They also point out that it is essential to maximize the&#13;
potential for private investment in the city's recovery. More information on cost recovery&#13;
associated with the project is provided in Chapter 5 (Benefits). Details on the city's&#13;
finances are available in Annex 5.&#13;
3.6   Although the City's financial management has started to improve, additional work&#13;
is needed with regard to the City's budget, accounting, and other financial systems in&#13;
order for the City to contract for the large amount of investment finance that it will&#13;
require in the future to finance the Center City Rehabilitation Program and its other&#13;
needs. The City has agreed to prepare a detailed plan and timetable by December 31.&#13;
1997 for undertaking specific improvements in financial management.&#13;
REGULATION&#13;
3.7   St. Petersburg has moved aggressively to develop a market infrastructure for&#13;
private property. The Bank has been a partner in these efforts: first, through the&#13;
inclusion of a Regulatory Action Program (RAP) for St. Petersburg as part of the Housing&#13;
Project, and second, through the preparation of this center city project.&#13;
3.8   Achievements. There is a great deal of real estate reform ongoing in St.&#13;
Petersburg. The city subscribes to the position that localities must take the initiative to&#13;
enact their own normative frameworks. Most legislative development is sponsored by the&#13;
city's Property Committee (KUGI), which chairs the city's Real Estate Committee and&#13;
sponsors stakeholder involvement through the Fund for Development of the St.&#13;
Petersburg Real Estate Market, a nonprofit organization created by KUGI. Some of the&#13;
city's achievements include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
(a)   Perhaps the most aggressive enterprise land privatization program in&#13;
Russia. Almost 1,000 applications accepted and over 300 titles actually&#13;
transferred (by December 1995).&#13;
(b)   The successful auction of land to private developers, under the Bank-&#13;
supported Housing Project (see below).&#13;
(c)   A working system of title registration, though in need of further&#13;
development.&#13;
(d)   Almost complete privatization of retail spaces.&#13;
(e)   An aggressive program of enterprise privatization (78% of enterprises&#13;
private by September 1995).&#13;
(f)    Concentrated work in real property appraisal and in improving the quality&#13;
of property rights, particularly for leaseholds.&#13;
(g)   An investment tender regulation on disposal of buildings and land through&#13;
competitive procedures.&#13;
(h)   An ordinance requiring market assessments for municipally managed real&#13;
property. This should improve the calculation of rates for long-term&#13;
property leases.&#13;
3.9   Housing Project Regulatory Action Plan (RAP). The RAP agreed to by the&#13;
city as part of the Housing Project in 1994 identified 4 key areas of regulatory reform:&#13;
title registration; land allocation/privatization; land use and development controls; and&#13;
housing reform. The city has substantially complied with expectations in all of the&#13;
targeted areas of reform. A summary of regulatory progress is attached in Annex 1 1.&#13;
3.10  Progress in registration of real estate rights was made early in the reform process,&#13;
and today the city has one of the most advanced systems in the Russian Federation for&#13;
registration of rights to housing, and steady progress is being made with respect to&#13;
registration of right to land and commercial structures. Regarding land&#13;
allocation/privatization, St. Petersburg successfully auctioned 87% of housing project&#13;
sites to private developers, and has moved very aggressively to privatize enterprise&#13;
owned land. With regard to reform of land use and development controls, the city agreed&#13;
to undertake a comprehensive review of present procedures and make adjustments to&#13;
accommodate the new market realities. In fact, there is presently a great deal of activity&#13;
in this area, involving several key city agencies and technical cooperation from USAID.&#13;
Recent seminars and round table discussions among key administrators and city&#13;
legislators have prompted support for reform of the antiquated master planning system&#13;
and positive steps toward a modem system of land use control, including a tentative&#13;
workplan for creation of a zoning ordinance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
3.11  Perhaps the most encouraging progress had been made recently in housing reform,&#13;
where the city has completed a successful pilot programs to encourage and assist in&#13;
creation of condominium associations; commenced a pilot program for tendering housing&#13;
management responsibilities to private sector firms; and taken steps to improve its system&#13;
of housing allowances.&#13;
3.12  Future Reforms. The City also has articulated objectives and a program of&#13;
legislative development to create an efficient private real estate market. The recently&#13;
elected governor of St. Petersburg sent a policy letter to the Bank describing and detailing&#13;
the program. The program will develop and further refine private property rights,&#13;
including the rights of lease and sublease. The program demonstrates that St. Petersburg&#13;
is grappling with issues of the demarcation between public and private rights that are&#13;
faced by all market economies. For example, the legislative program covers techniques to&#13;
strengthen the ability of the public authorities to regulate and guide development and land&#13;
use while preserving investment and market incentives of private parties. The ambitious&#13;
legislative development program includes the following specific legislative or normative&#13;
acts:&#13;
(a)   City Planning Code of St. Petersburg&#13;
(b)   On Real Property Management by [Private Sector] Management&#13;
Companies&#13;
(c)   The Land Code of St. Petersburg&#13;
(d)   The Land Fee Code&#13;
(e)   On Sublease of Land Parcels&#13;
(f)   St. Petersburg Zoning Code&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.13  Project Management Structures. The city recognizes that the center city&#13;
renovation is a complex and multi-sectoral effort that will require the inputs of many city&#13;
committees that are used to operating rather independently. It also requires coordination&#13;
with other specific initiatives, such as the EBRD-financed effort to improve municipal&#13;
finances and with stakeholders outside the city government. Therefore, the Governor has&#13;
set up structures for project preparation and implementation to coordinate among the&#13;
various departments and committees and with the federal government. First, a&#13;
local/federal Coordinating Group headed by the Governor provides for the highest level&#13;
review and approvals. The Coordinating Group includes the six deputy mayors most&#13;
concerned with the center city activities, including the two first deputy governors. The&#13;
Coordinating Group also includes three representatives from the federal level, from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
Ministries of Construction, Economy, and Finance.2 Second, the governor set up a&#13;
Working Group with individual members from many departments. St. Petersburg's&#13;
Director of Construction has been named chairman of the Working Group. The Working&#13;
Group provides for communication and operational support from the various committees&#13;
of the city concerned with the project. Third, the governor is setting up a Foundation&#13;
responsible for day-to-day supervision of the project (see below).&#13;
3.14 Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The City has established the PIU, which&#13;
will supervise the day to day work of the project and provide the link to the working and&#13;
coordinating groups. Most of the actual technical work would be performed by the&#13;
General Consultant. The legal form for the PIU is as a non-commercial foundation, the&#13;
St. Petersburg Foundation for Investment Projects. The Foundation has founders drawn&#13;
from the stakeholders. The Foundation would eventually handle projects that receive&#13;
funding from the Bank and from EBRD and other large projects. Initially, the&#13;
Foundation is planned to handle three related projects, this Center City Rehabilitation&#13;
Project, the St. Petersburg component of the Russian Federation Housing Project&#13;
(absorbing the staff of the existing Local Project Implementation Unit) and the Federally&#13;
targeted program for Preservation and Renovation of the Historic Areas of St. Petersburg.&#13;
Funds from the Center City project would pay the salaries and overhead of the staff of the&#13;
foundation concerned with the project.&#13;
3.15 Bank Supported Project Review Unit. The Government of Finland has&#13;
provided a US$3.4 million grant to assist in the preparation of the St. Petersburg Center&#13;
City Projects, as well as preparation of a Russian Federation Water and Sewerage Project.&#13;
The Finnish Government required, and the Bank agreed, that the funds would be&#13;
disbursed through a trust fund in the World Bank. The Government of Russia has signed&#13;
the grant agreement. Under the terms of the grant, funds may only be used for&#13;
preparation of the current project and the follow-on project; funds may not be used for&#13;
project implementation. A Project Review Unit (PRU) funded by the Grant and staffed&#13;
by long-term and short-term international professionals and some local staff was&#13;
established to assist St. Petersburg in reviewing the preparation of this Project and the&#13;
larger project that would succeed it. The PRU will provide advisory services to the St.&#13;
Petersburg government on the preparation of follow-on investments and will assist in&#13;
coordinating donor inputs on the current project.&#13;
3.16  Role of Stakeholders. St. Petersburg has a broad range of stakeholders with&#13;
different, but not necessarily conflicting, interests in the rehabilitation of the Center City.&#13;
The two boxes identify some of these stakeholders.&#13;
2 The representative from the Ministry of Construction is the Deputy Minister for Housing Reform, who&#13;
also oversees the Bank supported Housing Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
Stakeholders in the Population&#13;
Residents, including&#13;
*      Owners of Privatized Housing&#13;
*      Tenants of Individual Apartnents owned by the city&#13;
*      Tenants of Communal Housing Owned by the City&#13;
*      Owners of Cooperative Housing&#13;
*      The Elderly (mainly women -constitute 30% of the population)&#13;
*      Special Groups entitled to housing subsidies (e.g., the military, police, refugees, Chemobyl victims,&#13;
veterans)&#13;
*      Owners of "dachas" or summer homes (25% of households)&#13;
Business Community&#13;
*      Construction firms and developers&#13;
-      Bankers&#13;
*      Tenants of commercial space&#13;
*      Real Estate professionals (architects, engineers, brokers)&#13;
*      Building material companies&#13;
3.17   The city has explicitly recognized the need to collaborate with stakeholders in the&#13;
planning of center city rehabilitation and in the implementation of the improvements&#13;
themselves. The business and professional community are assisting in drafting&#13;
legislation. In addition, the December 1995 stakeholders seminar, attended by&#13;
stakeholders from citizens groups, the business community, donors, foundations and the&#13;
government, coalesced on a number of recommendations in addition to the&#13;
recommendation of locating pilots in Block 130. These include the need to: a) further&#13;
refine leases and other documents for transferring property rights; b) clarify the technical&#13;
rules for preservation requirements of historic buildings and provide incentives for their&#13;
rehabilitation; c) streamline procedures for issuing building permits and for marketing&#13;
city properties; d) define the rights and responsibilities of Area Development Agencies;&#13;
and e) complete regulations on condominium formation and provide financial facilities&#13;
for rehabilitation and reconstruction of buildings by condominium associations.&#13;
3.18   During project implementation, five mechanisms are proposed for continuing and&#13;
deepening stakeholder involvement and collaboration:&#13;
(a)    Surveys and public opinion polls, buildin  on surveys already carried out&#13;
in Block 130 and the Kapella Courtyards.&#13;
3 There is a lack of informnation available on settlement patterns, housing conditions, land uses, and the views&#13;
of citizens regarding their needs. It is necessary to develop this information for the entire center city through&#13;
structured surveys early in the implementation of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
(b)    Information sharing through public hearings, targeted public education,&#13;

3.19 Implementation Schedule. The project would be implemented over a period of&#13;
three and a half years. A detailed implementationschedule is in Annex 16 Schedule A.&#13;
The schedule calls for the hiring of the General Consultant and initiation of pilot schemes in&#13;
April 1997. The project should be complete by June 30, 2000.&#13;
4 Participation of residents is currently difficult because non-governmental organization (NGOs) are just&#13;
beginning to form and there appears to be mistrust and disinterest due in part to the economic hardships&#13;
associated with the transition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
3.20   Accounting. The City of St. Petersburg would be responsible for the appropriate&#13;
accounting of the funds provided by the Bank under the Project, for reporting on the use&#13;
of these funds and for ensuring timely submission of audits of financial statements and&#13;
reports to the Bank.&#13;
3.21   The City would establish an accounting system to provide information on the&#13;
proper receipt and use of funds furnished in accordance with the Loan Agreement. It&#13;
would perform these functions through the PIU.s The PIU, in turn, will direct the&#13;
General Consultant to set up the system and make the entries. Accounting for all Special&#13;
Account transactions and all other project accounts will be maintained in accordance with&#13;
practices and standards satisfactory to the Bank, with the objective of timely and accurate&#13;
accounting of all transactions under the Project.&#13;
3.22   Reporting. Reporting would be geared to the specific requirements of the project&#13;
in a format satisfactory to the Bank. The City will submit reports on a quarterly basis. A&#13;
mid-term review will assist in providing for mid-course corrections. A Project&#13;
Completion Report would be submitted to the Bank by the City promptly after the&#13;
conclusion of project activity, and in any event not later than 6 months after the loan&#13;
closing date.&#13;
3.23 Monitoring Indicators. Monitoring indicators to be used in reporting include:&#13;
(a)    Objective: to further develop and agree with the city and Federal&#13;
authorities on a strategic plan and a city investment program for center city&#13;
rehabilitation.&#13;
(i)    Decisions of the city government and coordinating council on the&#13;
development of the strategic plan.&#13;
(ii)    Development of short-term and mid-term development plans.&#13;
(iii)   Progress on design and engineering for works for the first two&#13;
years of the follow-on project to be financed by the Bank.&#13;
(b)    Objective: to continue regulatory reform to assure competitive real estate&#13;
markets and a competitive business environment in the center city.&#13;
(i)    List and evaluate new regulatory and legal documents.&#13;
(ii)    An increasing percentage of non-budgetary investment in&#13;
construction and rehabilitation of buildings.&#13;
5 The accounting system for tracking the administrative expenditures of the PIU itself has already been set&#13;
up with advisory assistance from the Foundation for Housing Reform (the CPIU for the Russian Federation&#13;
Housing Project).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
(iii)   An increasing percentage of lots and buildings on blocks included&#13;
in this project will be awarded to developers on a competitive basis&#13;
for rehabilitation.&#13;
(iv)   An increase in cost recovery for building maintenance and utilities&#13;
due to increase in rents and utility payments with subsidies&#13;
targeted increasingly to low-income groups of the population.&#13;
(c)   Objective: to initiate a program of public information and participation in&#13;
the decision making process for city development and investment;&#13;
(i)    Mass media (e.g., number of publications, including ads and TV&#13;
programs).&#13;
(ii)   Direct work with the public and with public organizations (i.e.,&#13;
meetings with the public, etc.).&#13;
(d)   Obiective: to carry out some visible physical improvements that can be&#13;
replicated on a larger scale in the future by implementing the pilot&#13;
projects;&#13;
(i)   Preparation of tender documentation.&#13;
(ii)   Signed contracts (number).&#13;
(iii)   Disbursements (amount).&#13;
3.24  Auditing. The project accounts, including the Special Account and the Cultural&#13;
Fund Operational Account, would be audited annually by independent auditors under&#13;
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. Separate audit statements would be prepared&#13;
for the Special Account and for Statement of Expenditures. All audit reports would be&#13;
made available to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year (i.e., by June&#13;
30).&#13;

BASIS OF COST ESTIMATES&#13;
4.2    Project Costs were estimated as follows:&#13;
(a)    Base Costs. All project costs are based on April 1996 prices converted to&#13;
US dollars. Technical cooperation costs for the general consultancy and&#13;
three local institutes (the Leontieff Center, the Fund for Development of&#13;
the Real Estate Sector, and the Project Implementation Unit) are derived&#13;
from recent fees quoted for comparative specialized services in Bank-&#13;
financed projects in Russia and are estimated per person month at&#13;
US$17,000 for external specialist services and US$700 for local specialist&#13;
services. The person month costs of TC include fees, recruitment/&#13;
relocation costs, housing and subsistence (for foreigners), and overheads.&#13;
Technical cooperation costs of design and engineering are based on&#13;
standardized charges in Russia and elsewhere of 8% of the cost of civil&#13;
works. Equipment unit costs are based on recent quotations from suppliers&#13;
of equipment and software. Civil works costs are based on recent&#13;
experience in St. Petersburg and include the cost of relocation (if relevant).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
(b)   Contingency Allowances. Contingencies for domestic price increases are&#13;
projected at 10%2 per year with the exchange rate of US$ = 4700 Rbl.&#13;
International inflation rates are included at 5 % per year.3 Physical&#13;
contingency allowances are included at 15 % for goods and works, 0% for&#13;
TC. Price and physical contingencies account for 8.5 % of project costs&#13;
(US$3.9 million).&#13;
(c)   Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component was&#13;
estimated at 45 % of total Technical Cooperation. The local content is&#13;
mainly for local consultants. Equipment purchases are assumed to be&#13;
100% (less foreign import duty) for equipment purchased on the&#13;
international market and 80% for equipment purchased locally. Total&#13;
project costs are US$46.1 million of which the foreign exchange&#13;
component is US$16.9 million.&#13;
(d)   Local Costs, Taxes and Duties. Project costs include a local cost&#13;
component of US$29. 1 million equivalent, which is 74% of baseline&#13;
project costs (excluding contingencies). Taxes are estimated to amount to&#13;
20 percent of items purchased locally. Taxes will be financed by the&#13;
Government of St. Petersburg.&#13;

4.4    Bank Loan. The total financing required, excluding interest during construction,&#13;
but including V.A.T. and duties is US$46.1 million, of which the Bank would finance&#13;
US$3 1.0 million equivalent (equivalent to 100% of the foreign exchange and 45% of&#13;
local costs). Of this total, US$1.0 million would be retained by the federal government&#13;
for the Special Culture Fund. The remaining US$30.0 million of the Bank loan will be&#13;
passed on by the Federal Government to the Government of St. Petersburg.&#13;
Arrangements will include a subsidiary loan for US$25.0 million and a grant for US$5.0&#13;
million. The subsidiary loan will feature a 0.5% spread over the cost to the Government&#13;
and the same maturities as the Bank loan. The loan would be a single currency loan&#13;
designated in US dollars at a floating LIBOR-based rate. The signing of a Subsidiary&#13;
Financing Agreement is a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan. The remaining&#13;
project costs would be covered by donors, supplier credits, and by the Government of St.&#13;
Petersburg.&#13;
4.5    Grant Financing. The project team has contacted a sizable number of official&#13;
donors and cultural NGOs in order to gain partners in the Center City Rehabilitation&#13;
Program and to assure that the international and bi-lateral community are operating in&#13;
concert with one another. As a result, a grant agreement has been signed with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
Government of Finland providing US$2.0 million for feasibility studies and other&#13;
preparatory costs of the follow-on project(s), and USAID has pledged to provide US$1.5&#13;
million to finance the strategic plan. In addition, Sweden, the Netherlands and the Getty&#13;
Foundation are financing related institution building, regulation, and seminars. Finally,&#13;
the City and the Bank are coordinating efforts closely with EBRD, Tacis and UNESCO.&#13;
4.6    Local/Borrower Contribution. The City of St. Petersburg will contribute&#13;
US$11.1 million to the project through its budgetary and extra-budgetary resources, a&#13;
sum equivalent to 24% of total project costs. Of this amount, approximately US$8.1&#13;
million will finance direct costs, while the remaining US$3.0 million will finance indirect&#13;
costs (local salaries, overhead, etc.). The schedule of local contributions is shown in&#13;
Table 4.4 below. Counterpart contributions would use 0.5% of the city's total budget (in&#13;
1996) of about US$2.2 billion equivalent and 5.6% of its budget for capital investment of&#13;
US$200 million equivalent. If this were the only project to be financed, the city would&#13;
not have a problem in meeting counterpart requirements; however, despite significant&#13;
revenues, the city's financial position is poor (see Chapter 3 and Annex 5). In order to&#13;
assure that project implementation is not delayed or compromised due to counterpart&#13;
finance problems, Government of St. Petersburg has agreed to: (i) not later than Februar,&#13;
1. 1997. open a Project Account in a commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable&#13;
to the Bank with an initial deposit equivalent to US$100.000: and (ii) thereafter maintain&#13;
and replenish said account at the beginning of each month to ensure that adequate funds.&#13;
as deemed necessary by the Bank. are available to meet expected local expenditures for&#13;
the next two months. In addition to the city contribution, private developers will provide&#13;
funds for the small amount in voluntary resettleent required ($1 80.000). The City will&#13;
be responsible for proper fulfillment of developers'obligations. Beneficiary organizations&#13;
of the Cultural Fund would also provide required counterpart funding ($250,000).&#13;

organization in the city with sole access to essential data necessary for required analysis&#13;
and extensive experience with similar assignments for the borrower; and (c) the Fund for&#13;
Development of the Real Estate Sector (loan amount US$0.3 million), a non-budgetary&#13;
organization created on the initiative of the City Real Estate Commission and delegated&#13;
the responsibility to prepare legislation dealing with a wide range of urban issues. The&#13;
Fund is the only organization with staff who are sufficiently skilled to draft legislation&#13;
required for project implementation. The Foundation has successfully undertaken similar&#13;
assignments for the borrower.5 The contract for the General Consultant would be awarded&#13;
to a firm whose qualifications, experience, and terms and conditions of employment are&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, following the competitive selection procedures in the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines. The participation of local consulting firms would be encouraged to develop&#13;
the local consulting industry. The assignment for the General Consultancy will require a&#13;
firmn with significant experience in historic preservation, real estate development, finance&#13;
and design and engineering around the world. The Government of St. Petersburg has&#13;
received proposals from a short list of six firms that would be suitable for the general&#13;
consultancy. In addition to the major contract for planning, management, design and&#13;
engineering, a number of relatively small contracts with individuals and with firms will&#13;
be required for specific institutional building consultants on which donor finance is not&#13;
forthcoming. The Bank would review and approve the terms of reference for all&#13;
consultancies. In addition, contracts with individuals over US$50,000 and with firms&#13;
over US$100,000 will be subject to prior Bank review and approval. Contracts with&#13;
An additional US$0.5 million is planned to be used primarily for purchase of computers and other&#13;
equipment and software, covered under "goods," although a small amount might be used for small&#13;
contracts for individual short-term consultants, training, seminars, study tours, etc. These small&#13;
contracts would also be procured on a sole source basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
firms and individuals under these amounts would be subject to ex-post review on a&#13;
selective basis during supervision missions and/or as part of periodic procurement&#13;
implementation reviews.&#13;
4.9   Civil Works. Pilot schemes will include small civil works, including&#13;
landscaping, leveling, storm drainage, roads and paving, installation of street lights and&#13;
decorative lights, installation of bus shelters, signs and ramps and handrails, potable and&#13;
waste water conduits, gas pipelines, electrical and telephone services, utility substations,&#13;
and repairs to some structures. Contracts above US$ 1.0 million will be procured through&#13;
ICB. Contracts between US$0.1 million and under US$1 million will be procured&#13;
through NCB. Approximately 17 such contracts are expected at an average size of&#13;
US$0.7 million. Should it be necessary to procure any works under US$100,000,&#13;
national shopping by competitive quotations will be used.&#13;
4.10  Civil works contracts will be tendered using the Bank's Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents (Procurement of Works: Smaller Contracts). The first three NCB contracts,&#13;
irrespective of value, will be pre-reviewed. The remaining packages will be subject to&#13;
post-review. Prior reviews will thus cover about 25% of the monetary total of civil works&#13;
financed by the Bank. For NCB contracts, the city will use Regional Standard Bidding&#13;
documents for works through NCB issued in August 1995.&#13;
4.11  Contractors interested in bidding under International Competitive Bidding&#13;
procedures will be prequalified. Contractors will be expected to comply with customary&#13;
civil works standards regarding experience, payment terns, and guarantees. During&#13;
prequalification, financial statements of foreign and domestic contractors, participating as&#13;
either independents or in association with other firms, will be examined to establish their&#13;
financial capacity. In the prequalification, potential bidders would be qualified to bid up&#13;
to an acceptable portion of their respective net financial and operational capacities.&#13;
4.12  Subloans. Subloans (US$1.8 million) under the special housing fund will be&#13;
made to developers to assist in relocating tenants to newly-constructed housing.&#13;
Individual subloans will be under US$35,000 equivalent and will be awarded on a "first&#13;
come first serve" basis to developers who meet detailed requirements spelled out in an&#13;
operational manual acceptable to the Bank (see para. 2.17-2.18).&#13;
4.13  Equipment and Goods. Contracting for goods with contract values estimated to&#13;
be in excess of US$300,000 equivalent will be procured by ICB. The Bank's Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents for the Procurement of Goods (of January 1995) will be used and&#13;
these contracts will be subject to prior Bank review. The Bank's current domestic&#13;
preference procedure would be used in all ICB nrocurement of goods. A total of five&#13;
contracts above US$300,000 are expected for the v lot projects. International Shopping&#13;
(IS) will be used for purchases which are betweeni UJS$50,000 and US$300,000 per&#13;
estimated contract value and have specifications that would be of interest to external&#13;
suppliers. The loan will finance about US$0.5 million of equipment and materials&#13;
associated with institutional development of Governmental departments and agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
The loan would be used for necessary equipment, software and materials that cannot be&#13;
covered through grants from donors. National Shopping will be used for purchases below&#13;
US$50,000. It is difficult to estimate the amount of ICB, IS, and National Shopping&#13;
purchases, because the Government is still in the process of ascertaining the interest of&#13;
donors to provide grants for some of this equipment; however, an allowance based on&#13;
reasonable estimates places the amount of such contracting as shown in Table 4.5 above.&#13;
4.14  Procurement Supervision. A tender committee has been appointed by the city's&#13;
Coordinating Committee to evaluate bids and make awards. The PIU will oversee the&#13;
general consultants engaged by the City of St. Petersburg, who will handle all&#13;
procurement aspects of the project. They will need to employ specialized staff to cover&#13;
these aspects. They will prepare documentation, participate in organizing the project&#13;
launch workshop (to be held within one month of their appointment), assist in the general&#13;
procurement notice (to be prepared within one month of their appointment), procurement&#13;
planning, bid packages, solicitations, evaluations, contracting and periodic procurement&#13;
reporting requirements. They will also help coordinate documentation flows needed to&#13;
secure the Bank's clearances and "No-Objections" on consultants' TORs and equipment&#13;
packages needing prior Bank review. Information on procurement activities will be&#13;
included in periodic reports prepared by the General Consultant and submitted quarterly&#13;
to the Bank on the progress in the project.&#13;
4.15  The above procurement plan will result in the Bank's prior review of about 43%&#13;
of total Bank funds committed for works and equipment. Besides reviewing TORs, Bank&#13;
reviews of contracting actions for consultant services and technical assistance activities&#13;
will cover all of the total Bank funding for technical assistance inputs. In addition, Bank&#13;
staff will monitor procurement activities, contract administration and project record-&#13;
keeping through the staff provided to the PRU under a Bank executed trust fund and&#13;
during supervision missions.&#13;
DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
4.16 Disbursements. The Bank would finance: (i) 100% of foreign expenditures of&#13;
imported goods, 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 80% of costs of other&#13;
items obtained locally; (ii) 100%, excluding any taxes, of consultants; (iii) 100% of&#13;
subloans; and (iv) 80% of total cost of works including taxes.&#13;
4.17  The estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Table 4.6. Disbursements&#13;
are expected to be completed within a period of 3 years from the date of effectiveness.&#13;
Please see Table 4.1 (earlier in this chapter) for a list of expenditure categories and&#13;
amounts.&#13;
4.18  Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, the borrower will&#13;
establish, maintain and operate, under conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special&#13;
Account in US dollars in a commercial bank within three months of effectiveness using&#13;
standard procedures in Russia. The authorized allocation of the special account is US$1.2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
million. Replenishment applications should be submitted at least every three months, and&#13;
must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting&#13;
documents.&#13;
4.19 Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Disbursements would be made against&#13;
Statements of Expenditure for individual consulting contracts of up to US$50,000&#13;
equivalent, firm consulting contracts of up to US$100,000 equivalent, goods contracts of&#13;
up to US$300,000 equivalent and works contracts of up to US$1 million equivalent for&#13;
which detailed documents evidencing expenditures will be reviewed by the Project&#13;
Implementation Unit (PIU) and made available for the required audit as well as to Bank&#13;
supervision mission. Disbursements against contracts exceeding US$50,000 equivalent&#13;
for individual consultants, US$100,000 equivalent for consulting firms, US$300,000&#13;
equivalent for goods and US$1.0 million equivalent for works would be made against&#13;
normal documentation.&#13;
4.20  Retroactive Financing. The City has requested, and the Bank has agreed to&#13;
include retroactive financing from June 1, 1996 to help defray some of the costs of&#13;
preparation which the city has incurred. Expenses incurred before the date of loan&#13;
signature shall not exceed $3.1 million (10% of the total amount of the loan). Retroactive&#13;
financing for previously procured contracts would only be provided where procurement&#13;
fully complied with Bank standards.&#13;
4.21  The project completion date will be June 30, 2000 and the closing date will be&#13;
December 31, 2000.&#13;
The proceeds of the loan (in US$ million) would be disbursed as shown below:&#13;

ST. PETERSBURG CENTER CITY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
5. SUSTAINABILITY, BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
5.1   Summary. The Preparation of a viable plan would have major benefits for St.&#13;
Petersburg. The Project would provide a flexible blueprint for conserving and restoring&#13;
the city's major economic asset, its historic core. It would point out ways where cost&#13;
recoverable public financing of infrastructure and public services could be used to&#13;
facilitate private sector implementation of building rehabilitation in a sensible regulatory&#13;
framework. The restoration would stimulate tourism and business development, creating&#13;
employment and raising incomes. The restoration of the central city would also enhance&#13;
St. Petersburg's cultural development. Increases in property value, improvements in&#13;
infrastructure and amenities and the upgrading of housing would improve the living&#13;
conditions of existing residents. City officials and residents widely recognize the&#13;
importance this restoration would have for the city's future, for they have consistentlytold&#13;
Bank missions and others that "the restoration of the historic area is St. Petersburg's most&#13;
importantpriority." The Federal governmentalso views the project as a demonstrationfor&#13;
other cities in Russia on center city rehabilitation, regulation, social assessment and&#13;
promotion of private investment.&#13;
5.2   Cost Recovery. The city's weak financial position requires that investment&#13;
projects include provisions for self- financing and for cost recovery. The table below&#13;
shows the specific arrangements proposed in the project for recovering costs. The city&#13;
will use the project as a training exercise in experimenting with new forms of cost&#13;
recovery that could later be generalized to other parts of the city. The city shall submit to&#13;
the Bank. not later than December 31. 1998. a report on adoption of cost-recovery&#13;
measures for the investments financed under the Proiect.&#13;

5.3    Economic, Financial, Social and Cultural Benefits of Center City&#13;
Rehabilitation. Rehabilitating the center city would provide financial and economic&#13;
benefits due to growth in tourism, in commercial activities, and in construction. It would&#13;
provide social benefits through amenities to residents, and improved services and&#13;
housing. Cultural benefits would be derived by rehabilitating historic buildings and&#13;
monuments. In addition to these separate benefits, combining activities into a&#13;
coordinated and coherent program should have a synergistic effect beyond the value of&#13;
each individual benefit service by incentivating and generating private investment.&#13;
5.4    The table below identifies specific benefits and beneficiaries of center city&#13;
rehabilitation, grouped into the three major types of benefit, cultural, financial, and social.&#13;
&#13;

Some benefits that have multiple impacts (financial, social and cultural) are listed&#13;
according to their main impact. It also lists the specific benefits that could be quantified to&#13;
measure returns. The ex-ante measurement of these benefits would be done during the&#13;
project in examining specific alternatives for a priority investment program.&#13;

5.5    Specific Benefits of Project&#13;
(a)    Technical Cooperation. The project is an essential element leading to a&#13;
program of Center City Rehabilitation. It would assist the city in&#13;
establishing a flexible strategy of developing its assets in an economy that&#13;
will be largely driven by market forces. It will focus on identifying and&#13;
preparing feasible projects to provide the specific public goods -- basic&#13;
infrastructure for example -- that will generate private sector development;&#13;
and it will assist in developing the regulatory and institutional framework&#13;
that will facilitate private development and operation of facilities. In&#13;
addition to substantial non-quantifiable benefits, the project will have&#13;
economic, social and financial benefits through the development of pilot&#13;
projects.&#13;
(b)    Pilot Schemes. Each of the pilot schemes was analyzed in order to assure&#13;
that benefits were at least sufficient to justify the public expenditures&#13;
required. Only part of the benefits for each pilot scheme was quantified&#13;
and measured. Once the threshold for economic feasibility was reached,&#13;
the quantification of these other benefits would serve to raise the economic&#13;
rate of return higher than the threshold level. The table below lists the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
pilot schemes, the measured economic benefits and economic rates of&#13;
return with these measured benefits. It also lists other benefits, both&#13;
quantifiable and unquantifiable, that would enhance this minimal&#13;
economic rate of retum, along with the beneficiaries of both quantified and&#13;
other benefits.&#13;

5.7    Environmental and Social Aspects.I The Engineering Loan is rated "B"&#13;
regarding environmental aspects. Possible environmental issues included soil&#13;
contamination, solid waste disposal, air emissions, traffic noise, and ground disturbance&#13;
in the course of limited civil works undertaken through pilot projects. These issues were&#13;
examined during the preparation of the project and a mitigation strategy has been&#13;
designed. For example, additional soil removal on Block 130 was included due to the&#13;
contaminated soil in existing open spaces. There is a clear need for a comprehensive City&#13;
Center Environmental Assessment and Strategy for purposes of developing and&#13;
implementing the future Center City Rehabilitation Investment Project. The&#13;
environmental assessment would be undertaken as part of feasibility studies included in&#13;
the technical assistance component of the project.&#13;
5.8    Professional sociologists carried out comprehensive surveys of the population of&#13;
Block 130 and Kapella Courtyards. They found extreme heterogeneity of living&#13;
conditions between residents that live in communal apartments (46% of 3000 residents in&#13;
Block 130) and those that live in individual apartments (54%).2 Both studies noted the&#13;
generally low paying capacity of most residents, and the existence of extremely poor&#13;
living conditions of those living in communal apartments. They also noted that the&#13;
majority of communal apartment residents were eager to move to an individual apartment&#13;
even though it would be outside of the center city,3 though some had unrealistic demands&#13;
regarding the quality of new housing. A number of rooms in communal flats are vacant,&#13;
and some 20% of registered residents of Block 130 are not actually living in the space&#13;
allotted. Other deficiencies in Block 130 include the absence of elevators in the&#13;
buildings, which meant that some elderly residents had not left their apartments in years.&#13;
Both social reports concluded that "relocation [for existing residents] is the only chance&#13;
of getting out of a dead-end housing situation." Based on these findings and on&#13;
interviews with real estate developers, the City decided to include: a) the experimental&#13;
For a more detailed discussion of the social aspects of the project, see Ayse Kudat's Socal Assessment,&#13;
attached as Annex 14.&#13;
2An often quoted statistic for the whole of the center city is than about 60-70% of residents live in&#13;
communal apartments. The smaller percentage in Block 130 probably reflects the fact that many of the&#13;
communal apartment dwellers have already relocated.&#13;
Indeed many residents of communal apartments have been on the waiting list for an individual apartment&#13;
for decades.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
Special Housing Fund to encourage voluntary relocation and b) the construction of a&#13;
building for elderly housing on Block 130.&#13;
5.9    The team also reviewed the City's policy regarding relocation. Existing&#13;
occupants have strong property rights. The City is extremely reluctant to engage in&#13;
relocating tenants involuntarily, even in situations where a few "holdouts" have prevented&#13;
the rehabilitation of an entire building. Though relocation practices are congruent with&#13;
Bank policy, the regulations are not very clear regarding relocation procedures and&#13;
policies. For this reason, specific relocation procedures were agreed to at negotiations&#13;
and are reflected in the supplemental letter to the Loan Agreement. The City has also&#13;
initiated work to formalize policies. A draft policy statement is available in Annex 9.&#13;
The General Consultant would review relocation issues and provide recommendations on&#13;
the formalizing of a policy. The City has agreed that not later than three months prior to&#13;
the commencement of resettlement activities under the Special Housing Fund to furnish&#13;
to the Bank a policy statement defining principles and procedures applicable to the&#13;
relocation of residents, from buildings requiring major rehabilitation in the center of the&#13;
city using the Special Housing Fund. The City has also agreed that it shall carry out&#13;
any resettlement in accordance with principles and guidelines agreed with the Bank and&#13;
pursuant to a time-bound action plan. satisfactory to the Bank, which shall be prepared on&#13;
the basis of the guidelines and furnished to the Bank not later than three months prior to&#13;
the expected date of the proposed resettlement.&#13;
5.10   Summary of Risks. The Central City InvestmentProject would be a complex&#13;
undertaking, requiring solution of difficult technical, institutional, financial and social&#13;
problems. It is precisely to reduce these risks that a prudent step-by-step approach is&#13;
recommended in which an Engineering Project is implemented first in order to carry out&#13;
studies, initiate regulatory change, build capacity and test approaches. In addition, major&#13;
policy shifts at either the central government or the city level may reduce the desire of the&#13;
Government to promote private investment, to borrow for St. Petersburg, and/or to work&#13;
withthe Bank. Althoughthe risk of major reversals in the move to markets appears to be&#13;
lessening gradually, the situation will remain tenuous for some time to come. Finally, the&#13;
project contains substantial technical assistance. Implementationof technical assistance is&#13;
especially problematic in other Bank-financed projects. Poor implementation of this&#13;
technical assistance will make it difficultto justify the follow-on investments. However,&#13;
implementationof the technical assistance in the Housing Project (the predecessorto this&#13;
project) has gone well, due to a committed counterpart agency and well-prepared&#13;
consultants who are drawing on substantial local expertise. These arrangements would be&#13;
repeated here.&#13;
Residents of communal flats cannot privatize their individual rooms unless all the other occupants of the&#13;
communal apartrnent agree; however, in all other respects they have the same rights as residents of&#13;
municipally owned individual apartments, in that they have the absolute right to occupy the apartment&#13;
along with their family.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
5.11   The project poses the following specific risks:&#13;
(a)    Administrative. The St. Petersburg government is a large, complex&#13;
bureaucracy with many organizations involved in the success of this&#13;
project. These organizations must participate in the planning process and&#13;
they must also contribute to an atmosphere that makes development&#13;
attractive. Each of these organizations has its own priorities and&#13;
objectives. They also have different views of the solutions to the problems&#13;
of the central city. Moreover, the bureaucracy includes people who do not&#13;
understand, or are not committed, to reform. If these forces cannot be&#13;
focused to solving the problems constructively, the project may fail. The&#13;
Governor has recognized the importance of bringing these elements&#13;
together by personally chairing the commission responsible for providing&#13;
the policy direction for the project.&#13;
(b)    Financial. The city's financial situation may make it difficult to provide&#13;
the necessary counterpart funds; however, it is unlikely that obtaining&#13;
these funds will be impossible as the project will have high visibility and a&#13;
high priority. But, if the city's normal operations are severely crippled or&#13;
the tax burdens become excessive, the success of the project will be&#13;
jeopardized. The center city does not operate in a vacuum. If the rest of&#13;
the city is in serious financial trouble, incentives for private investment in&#13;
the center city will be seriously reduced. The city is attempting to deal&#13;
with these problems through a program of municipal financial&#13;
strengthening funded by the EBRD.&#13;
(c)    Market. The success of the project depends heavily on stimulating private&#13;
investment in the center city. Historic preservation is expensive and risky.&#13;
Even ordinary rehabilitation is subject to high costs and uncertain returns.&#13;
The uncertain political situation in Russia is a negative influence on&#13;
investment. Lack of financing for private investors could also prove to be&#13;
a critical problem. The Housing Project includes a component to stimulate&#13;
this area of investment by private banks but it is too soon to evaluate the&#13;
results. Moreover, there may simply be a lack of demand for facilities at&#13;
the prices necessary to support rehabilitation of a great many of these&#13;
structures. This is why the project takes a broad approach in which center&#13;
city rehabilitation is viewed as an opportunity to stimulate tourism and&#13;
commercial activity that will provide income to residents. Increased&#13;
economic activity will in turn stimulate the market and provide the means&#13;
for increased investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
(d)   Legal. The rights to property are still under development in Russia and in&#13;
the city. Issues include providing full ownership rights, the timing of the&#13;
transfer of property rights so that they can be used as security for&#13;
borrowing and the rights of current occupants of property. St. Petersburg&#13;
has made satisfactory progress on the regulatory action plan for the&#13;
Russian Federation Project. The Center City Rehabilitation Project will&#13;
provide additional assistance to the city for developing appropriate&#13;
legislation. Other donors, including USAID, Sweden, and TACIS are also&#13;
active in this area.&#13;
(e)    Social. Although the project has built in significant safeguards to protect&#13;
tenants during voluntary or involuntary relocation and Russian legislation&#13;
provides strong protections of its own, resettlement always has an element&#13;
of risk. Specific relocation procedures to mitigate these risks were agreed&#13;
at negotiations and incorporated into the legal agreements including: (i) a&#13;
supplemental letter to the Loan Agreement detailing resettlement policies&#13;
and procedures; (ii) a covenant requiring a resettlement action plan, which&#13;
must be agreed to by the Bank; and (iii) availability of an ombudsman to&#13;
resolve any disputes that might arise under the Special Housing Fund.&#13;

Annex 1&#13;
SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
St. Petersburg History and Economy&#13;
1.    Peter the Great founded the City of St. Petersbur. in 1703 to be the capital of&#13;
the Russian Empire, its window on the West, and its admiiListrative, cultural and&#13;
intellectual center. Largely ignored during the Soviet era, St. Petersburg escaped&#13;
socialist-style physical redevelopment and its 54 square kilometer historic center&#13;
remains a masterpiece of architecture and its finest treasure. Designated by UNESCO&#13;
as a World Heritage site, the city has some 3000 registered historical and architectural&#13;
monuments, and some 900 cultural institutions (museums, libraries, theaters), including&#13;
the world famous Mariinskiy (former Kirov) theater and the State Hermitage Museum.&#13;
The historical center has one of the largest and most beautiful urban architectural&#13;
ensembles in the world, with its canals, churches, estates, palaces, public buildings and&#13;
monuments. However, St. Petersburg is more than a historic monument; it remains a&#13;
living and vibrant city. Some 800,000 people reside in the center, and one million&#13;
people have their workplaces there.&#13;
Historic Legacy&#13;
2.    St. Petersburg is a manifestation of the vision of its founder, Peter the Great.&#13;
Much influenced by Amsterdam, Peter's initial design for the city included a system of&#13;
canals like Amsterdam, but on a grand scale suitable for an imperial power. The city&#13;
began with the construction of the Peter and Paul's fortress on the strategic inlet of the&#13;
Neva River. The city was designed through architectural plans by the foremost&#13;
European architects of their time. These included Domenico Trezzini, a Swiss who&#13;
designed Vassilevski Island using European grid patterned city layout, and Leblon, a&#13;
French architect who completed a general plan for a fortified city in the classical&#13;
tradition. Succeeding architects included Schutter, Rastrelli, Cameron, Rinaldi,&#13;
Zakharov, Voronikhin, Monferran, Rossi and others. Starting in the late 19th Century&#13;
and ending around 1914, the city experienced a construction boom. During this phase&#13;
mansions and palaces were built and expanded in the city. However, St. Petersburg has&#13;
always managed to preserve its grand design which includes expanses of open space,&#13;
canals and parks that are interspersed with monuments and public buildings. The&#13;
buildings and monuments include many rare examples of 18th century baroque and&#13;
19th century classical and jugendstil architecture.&#13;
3.    As the capital of the Russian empire for over 200 years until 1917, St.&#13;
Petersburg also functioned as the intellectual and artistic center of Russia. Legendary&#13;
figures such as Pavlova, GlinkaTchaikovsky, Pushkin Gregol, Dostoyevsky, and many&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
others produced their best works and performances in the city. Its achievements in&#13;
literature, drama, music, dance and visual arts are a legacy that lives today. St.&#13;
Petersburg's museums and libraries are endowed with unique collections of works of&#13;
art, historical documents and books attractive to scholars, specialists, tourists and&#13;
ordinary city residents.&#13;
4.    The 1917 revolution was an abrupt break with the past, and the Bolsheviks&#13;
moved the capital to Moscow. This was fortunate for St. Petersburg. Unlike Moscow,&#13;
there were no attempts to tear down the historic center in order to "modernize" it into a&#13;
truly "socialist" city. Most of the churches, architectural ensembles, and buildings&#13;
survived intact, through the wear and tear is noticeable in all structures.&#13;
5.    The city's finest moments and its indomitable spirit are embodied in the heroism&#13;
of its citizens during World War II. The people of St. Petersburg were subject to&#13;
artillery and air bombardment and endured a blockade of 900 days. About a third of&#13;
its population of over two million people died during the war. Despite the hardships&#13;
and danger, the citizens made heroic efforts to save and hide their art and treasures.&#13;
Though the city suffered considerable damage, it was reconstructed after the war and&#13;
some historic structures, such as the Hermitage Museum and the imperial palaces in the&#13;
suburbs, were masterfully rehabilitated.&#13;
6.    The historic center occupies 54 square kilometers, 10 times the size of Venice,&#13;
though only a small portion of the total city area of 1400 square kilometers. It includes&#13;
two islands (Vassilevsky and Petrovsky) and two large city districts (Admiralty and&#13;
Central). Within its boundaries are some 8000 urban properties, of which 5300 are&#13;
historic monuments and 2500 are classified as important architectural ensembles (i.e.,&#13;
academies, monasteries, etc.). The center includes some 900 cultural institutions&#13;
(museums, libraries, theaters) among its historic structures.&#13;
7.    Today this cultural heritage is under stress. During the last 100 years, there&#13;
was little rehabilitation and renovation of the historic buildings; and routine repairs and&#13;
maintenance have been neglected for decades. Architectural and historic monuments of&#13;
world significance are deteriorating rapidly. Nearly every day the local newspapers&#13;
document injuries caused by collapsing structures. Priceless books and works of art in&#13;
historic structures are seriously threatened by complex preservation problems and a&#13;
lack of resources. Damp air, flooded basements, and antiquated plumbing systems are&#13;
destroying collections stored in the hundreds of libraries, museums, and archives that&#13;
line the city's 86 canals.&#13;
The City's Economy&#13;
8.    Like other cities in Russia, St. Petersburg's economy has suffered in the&#13;
economic transition. Large industries have collapsed, leading to reductions in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
employment and in the City's revenue base. Manufacturing output decline more than&#13;
50% since 1990 and capital investment by 60%. Cargo flows through St. Petersburg's&#13;
commercial port declined by nearly 70% because of strong competition with ports in&#13;
Finland and other Baltic countries.&#13;
9.    However, there are early signs of economic recovery. The city witnessed&#13;
energetic growth of market-oriented industries (e.g., banking, small business,&#13;
intermediary services, etc.). The performance of retail trade and transport cannot be&#13;
reliably evaluated due to the importance of the newly emerging private sector,&#13;
including the informal sector. International trade has grown. For example, it&#13;
increased in 1994 by one third from 1993. Exports of machinery and equipment are&#13;
higher than the Russian average; and imports reflect the strong consumer market&#13;
economy.&#13;
10.   St. Petersburg is one of the leading cities in economic reform, especially with&#13;
regard to privatization. In 1995, non-state enterprises in the city employed over one&#13;
third of the workforce, produced over 40% of manufacturing output, and provided for&#13;
80% of retail and service turnover, and 60% of cargo motor shipments. It is estimated&#13;
that over 50% of employment by the end of 1995 was in non-state enterprises. In 1994,&#13;
the city had over 60,000 small businesses with 600,000 employees. Small businesses&#13;
are concentrated in services, trade, construction and science. Eight thousand enterprises&#13;
were registered during 1991-4 with foreign investment from 61 countries (with&#13;
strongest representation from the US, Finland and Germany).&#13;
11.   Analysts within the city have started to assess the city's economic prospects.&#13;
Their vision for the St. Petersburg of the future is that it will become a multifunctional&#13;
European city, preserving its role as a major scientific, educational and cultural center&#13;
for neighboring regions of Russia and for neighboring Baltic states. They note that it is&#13;
likely that there will be a further reduction of overall employment in the manufacturing&#13;
sector. However, they believe that overall economic growth in Russia will lead to&#13;
strong increases in transport turnover, trade, and services. Given St. Petersburg's&#13;
cultural assets, increases in both domestic and international tourism can be expected.&#13;
To date, international tourism has increased by 300% since 1990, though domestic&#13;
tourism is down due to the economic depression. St. Petersburg will remain an&#13;
important center for higher education, research and development, both in Russia and&#13;
internationally.&#13;
Tourism&#13;
12.   Cultural tourism will be of special significance to the economy of the historic&#13;
center. A 1994 study was financed by the European Commission (Tacis) on the&#13;
Privatization of the Tourism Industry. The study concludes that St. Petersburg has the&#13;
potential to attract visitors from all over the world in increasing numbers, but to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
achieve this, it needs to improve its infrastructure, including the creation of a modem&#13;
and efficient hotel industry. Presently there are 150 overnight accommodation facilities&#13;
providing 32,000 beds. Two thirds of this capacity is contained in 36 hotels. There are&#13;
three five starts hotels, much fewer than in other European cities. There are four mid-&#13;
class hotels, some of them rather large. Although these have satisfactory locations and&#13;
are popular with groups, business travelers and individual guests usually prefer higher&#13;
quality and standards. Some 19 hotels are low tariff. Most have poor locations and&#13;
obsolete equipment. Although they presently have high occupancy rates (as a result of&#13;
domestic demand and a lack of competition), some are considered unlikely to survive in&#13;
the longer term unless they can be improved.&#13;
13.   The study points out that the hotel industry suffers from a lack of investment&#13;
capital, a low level of know-how and professional training, and inadequate&#13;
infrastructure for guests. Though staffing levels are high compared with international&#13;
hotels, customer service is low. The city particularly lacks moderately priced hotels&#13;
with reasonable management in good locations. There is also a lack of clean and simple&#13;
but well-run hotels for lower budget visitors. The city plans to encourage competition&#13;
in order to provide incentives to existing privatized hotels to improve service.&#13;
14.   The city also would like to provide professional tourism promotion. The&#13;
German Government plans to finance a study to examine alternatives.&#13;
Demographics&#13;
15.   The economic transition has had a dramatic effect on demographics. In 1993-4,&#13;
St. Petersburg had the lowest birthrate in Russia and one of the highest death rates.&#13;
The death rate has exceeded the birth rate since 1989. The number of deaths increased,&#13;
and the number of births decreased steadily until 1993. In 1995, there were 34,000&#13;
births and 76,000 deaths. Life expectancy is low, especially for men (58.1 years), and&#13;
migration from the city was higher than immigration from 1991-3. Immigration&#13;
rebounded in 1994 to a positive balance.&#13;
16.   The population of St. Petersburg is presently 4.75 million. The population is&#13;
aging. Twenty five percent of the population is elderly, including 35 % of center city&#13;
residents. About 50% of the population is in the labor force. Open unemployment is&#13;
low, around 2%, but expected to rise as privatized industries actively restructure and&#13;
shed labor. Underemployment is a problem in St. Petersburg, as elsewhere in Russia,&#13;
and 400,000 people at the beginning of 1995 (1 % of the labor force) were listed as&#13;
working part time or on administrative leave.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
Social Hardship&#13;
17.   The collapse of production and investment had led to social stress and a sharp&#13;
decline in living standards for the majority of the population. Despite the economic&#13;
decline, real average incomes started to increase in 1994. In 1994, per capita income&#13;
increased by 4.6 times (in normal terms), while prices increased by 4 times overall and&#13;
the consumption basket prices increased by 3.7 times. Average income increases were&#13;
due to a surge in business activity, especially in enterprise profit sharing and from&#13;
finance and property operations. However, the gap between the rich and the poor&#13;
increased sharply. In 1994 the ratio of average incomes of the wealthiest 10% to the&#13;
poorest 10% reached 16.2 (compared to 15.1 in Russia as a whole.) Wages are highest&#13;
in management, procurement, construction, and distribution; and lowest in&#13;
manufacturing, education, culture and science. Sociological surveys show some&#13;
anomalies. For example, the percentage of household income that was spent on food&#13;
sharply increased with price liberalization in early 1992 to reach 88% of household&#13;
income; however, since then it has fallen to 58% of income (mid 1994, the latest&#13;
statistic available).&#13;

Annex 2&#13;
Sector Context&#13;
Housing and Infrastructure&#13;
General Considerations&#13;
1.    The housing and infrastructure of the historic center is old and poorly&#13;
maintained due to lack of funds and, in the case of infrastructure, unsuitable designs.&#13;
The ground water level in the area is high, the soil is corrosive and carries stray&#13;
electric currencies aggravating the corrosion problems of water, sewerage, gas and&#13;
district heating networks.&#13;
2.    Poor maintenance has led to numerous service disruptions and waste of water&#13;
and heat energy and has created hazardous conditions due to gas leaks and frequent&#13;
explosions. Heat and water consumption are 2-3 times that of comparable districts in&#13;
Western Europe. This is only partly attributable to the poor condition of the networks.&#13;
Buildings have very high consumption due to a lack of metering and automatic controls&#13;
and appropriate pricing.&#13;
3. Rehabilitation of infrastructure in the city center is expensive due to difficult&#13;
excavation conditions since the infrastructure is located in congested streets and often&#13;
under structures of historical value. Therefore, special installation techniques (inner&#13;
pipe insertion or internal lining of existing pipes, horizontal drilling, etc.) should be&#13;
used. The utility companies estimate that the approximate rehabilitation cost of piping&#13;
networks in the area would be about one million US$/km. About 20% of gas piping&#13;
(200 km), 20% of water and sewage piping (480km) and 100% of district heating&#13;
piping (500km) would need to be rehabilitated during the next 10 years.' The cost of&#13;
the rehabilitation would thus be approximately US$120m/year, representing an annual&#13;
cost of US$6/m2 per each square meter of floor space in city center during the next 10&#13;
years.&#13;
4. The City provides subsidies to assist in maintaining the existing housing stock and&#13;
provide utility services to the population. The Table below shows the amounts of&#13;
subsidies provided in 1995.&#13;
The Housing Project includes a component to reline waterpipes in the Central City. This is designed to&#13;
save sufficient treated water to more than accommodate new housing constructed under the project.&#13;

1. Even with the large amounts of subsidies allocated, the poor financial standing of&#13;
the utilities does not allow an adequate level of maintenance, thus leading to&#13;
unsatisfactory functioning of public utilities. High subsidies also provide disincentives&#13;
for buildings to organize condominium associations to contract for their own&#13;
maintenance. Starting February 1 of 1996 housing rents were increased by two times,&#13;
and household tariffs for heat and hot water supply - by 2.5 times. In September of&#13;
1996 the municipal governments increased payment again for water supply by 1.3 times&#13;
and for energy supply - by 1.4 times.&#13;
2. In accordance with the Resolution of the Government of Russia N 707, dated June&#13;
18, 1996 the cost of communal services paid by the population will reach the level of&#13;
full cost recovery by 2003. At the same time, targeted assistance is provided for low-&#13;
income families that are unable to pay the full cost of communal services.&#13;
Specific Services&#13;
Housing&#13;
3.   In 1995, St. Petersburg's residential stock provided an average of 19 square&#13;
meters per person. This is somewhat better than the average in Russia but only about&#13;
75 % of the average in industrialized countries. A particular characteristic of housing&#13;
in St. Petersburg, and particularly the housing in the center, is that a significant amount&#13;
of the stock was built before 1917. Most of this pre-Revolutionary stock has been&#13;
turned into "communal flats" or shared apartments. Typically, an entire family lives in&#13;
one room, and share a kitchen, toilet, and bathroom with other families in a once larger&#13;
apartment intended for a single family. The living arrangements are uncomfortable and&#13;
crowded at best. Maintenance within the apartment and in the building is severely&#13;
deficient. Many communal flats have leaks and vermin. Novels have been written on&#13;
the hardships and personal animosities that arise from life in communal flats. It is said&#13;
that communal flats comprises 12.5% of the housing stock in the city as a whole, and&#13;
accommodate 24% of the population overall and 60-70% of the population in the&#13;
historic center. However, the number of communal flats is decreasing both formally&#13;
and informally. The City's Housing Committee reported recently that the number of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57&#13;
communal apartments fell by 4.5% in 1995 alone. The municipal housing waiting list&#13;
contains 325,000 families, who are deemed to be living in substandard conditions, 17%&#13;
of households in St. Petersburg.&#13;
4. The St. Petersburg authorities are particularly concerned with the condition of&#13;
existing housing. They estimate that, in the city as a whole, only 39% of residential&#13;
housing is in good condition; another 50% is in satisfactory condition; and 11% is unfit&#13;
for occupation. The older stock in the center is in particularly bad condition. Many&#13;
buildings have never been rehabilitated or undergone comprehensive repairs. A&#13;
building survey in the historic center found 3170 buildings in need of rehabilitation.&#13;
Ten million square meters of housing (housing about 500,000 persons) in the city&#13;
center needs capital repair or reconstruction. One and a half million square meters of&#13;
housing should be repaired on an emergency basis. In addition some 400,000 square&#13;
meters of housing (representing about 20 thousand persons) are in such poor condition&#13;
that they cannot be repaired, and its inhabitants should be resettled.&#13;
5. Housing policies in the Soviet Union called for rapid industrialization and the mass&#13;
production of housing to accommodate new urban dwellers. Little Soviet-style&#13;
industrial housing is found in the city center however. Major housing reforms have&#13;
liberalized the housing industry and created the beginning of a private housing market.&#13;
New housing construction fell precipitously from 1989-92, but has since revived to&#13;
levels approaching those immediately before the transition. New construction in 1995&#13;
reached 1.14 million square meters, a 13% increase over 1994. New construction is&#13;
now being led by the emerging private sector. Three fourths of newly constructed&#13;
housing is purchased by families who have to pay its full cost.&#13;
6. The Bank supported Russian Federation Housing Project (Loan No. L38500 with a&#13;
Board Approval date of March 7, 1995) supports the creation of private housing&#13;
markets. Specific components include land development and construction finance in&#13;
five reforming cities (including St. Petersburg) and a national component to strengthen&#13;
the building materials industry. The project also includes technical assistance and&#13;
training and funding for project management. The land development component in St.&#13;
Petersburg comprises the servicing and subdivision of specific tracts of land outside of&#13;
the city center. This land will be sold through an auction process to private developers.&#13;
Thus far, land auctions have been successful and infrastructure provision is in process.&#13;
The private developers will build housing on the land and sell the housing on the&#13;
private market. The construction finance component comprises a line of credit to&#13;
accredited commercial banks. The banks will on-lend these funds to private investors&#13;
and developers for the construction and rehabilitation of modest housing that meets&#13;
eligibility criteria in terms of energy efficiency, size and type. In addition, the line of&#13;
credit may be used to rehabilitate historic housing in the center city of St. Petersburg&#13;
without regard to size limitations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58&#13;
7. Economic liberalization of the housing and real estate industry has also led to the&#13;
conversion and upgrading of communal apartments in the central city into individual&#13;
dwellings. More than 300 private local real estate companies are active in the local&#13;
market. The process is to purchase an individual apartment elsewhere to relocate on a&#13;
voluntary basis each family in a communal apartment. Typically, the new individual&#13;
apartment has a floor area 1.5-1.7 times the floor area inhabited in the communal&#13;
apartment. In 1994, the cost of resettling tenants was estimated by private realtors as&#13;
$650-950 per square meter (in an old building) or US$10,200-11,800 per person (1994&#13;
prices). Realtors report that a professional agent spends about 4-10 days per family to&#13;
find suitable alternative accommodation. Typically, families are offered 5-6 apartments&#13;
before they will make a decision to accept the resettlement offer. Russian real estate&#13;
investors rank the time and cost connected with tenant resettlement as the major&#13;
constraint to rehabilitation, while foreign investors were more concerned about the&#13;
uncertainty of future city charges 2 The existing communal apartment is then repaired&#13;
and converted to an individual apartment, or, more commonly, to office space. A&#13;
considerable number of units have been upgraded in this manner; however reliable data&#13;
are not available on the extent of the process. Many buildings have some apartments&#13;
that have been upgraded and sold or leased to high paying tenants. Typically, there is&#13;
a mix of improved and unimproved apartments in a building, with the city continuing&#13;
to provide (inadequate) maintenance of common spaces. Although purchasing&#13;
individual apartments is feasible, obtaining enough apartments to permit private&#13;
ownership of the entire building is problematic. The scarcity of entire buildings that are&#13;
available is reflected in market valuations in the center city, in which private investors&#13;
typically put a premium of about 100% on the square meter value of a building that is&#13;
empty and ready for total rehabilitation.3&#13;
8.     Gas. All gas is supplied by Lengas, an employee cooperative that leases its&#13;
assets from the municipality under a long term lease. Under the lease, the purchasing&#13;
of gas from Lentransgas (Gazprom), billing, and operation of the system is the&#13;
responsibility of Lengas. The tariff setting is done according to federal decrees (based&#13;
on average federal costs) affecting the whole sector. The company's profitability&#13;
depends on maintaining an operational cost lower than the federal average, and on&#13;
other matters (lease negotiations, scope of maintenance works etc.). The company is&#13;
profitable. Routine maintenance is covered by Lengas but capital maintenance&#13;
(rehabilitation) and new investments come from the city budget. At this time Lengas&#13;
2 Foreign investors generally will not consider rehabilitating a building until it has been completely resettled.&#13;
3 The mean asking price for separate apartments in the center city in 1995 is estimated at $480-600/square&#13;
meter, with prices up to $1000 per square meter for apartments repaired under western standards. At the&#13;
same time, an unrepaired building cleared of tenants, with its inner walls demolished and trash removed, can&#13;
be sold for US$1200 per square meter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59&#13;
sells gas to industry and power and heating plants (80%) and to households for cooking&#13;
and hot water preparation. Some 70% of the network assets and maintenance cost is&#13;
attributable to the household distribution.&#13;
9.    The gas distribution system has three pressure levels, 10 bar, 3 bar and 0.015&#13;
bar. Industry is served from the 10 bar and 3 bar pressure levels and housing mostly&#13;
from the 0.015 bar pressure level. It is the company's intention to eliminate the 0.015&#13;
bar distribution piping and connect all housing through individual pressure reducers to&#13;
medium pressure (3 bar) network (as in west European countries). All rehabilitation&#13;
that is now taking place is implemented according to this strategy. This will upgrade&#13;
the capacity of the distribution system to accommodate higher gas consumption. EC is&#13;
funding a rehabilitation study (ECU1.3m) for Lengas.&#13;
10.   Water and Sewerage. All water and sewerage services are supplied by&#13;
Vodokanal, which is a municipal company. The company is responsible for&#13;
rehabilitation of water and sewage lines. Construction of new installations, such as new&#13;
pumping stations and new major water and sewer lines is, however, managed by the&#13;
City Construction Department.&#13;
11. The major problems in water and sewerage networks in the city center are: a)&#13;
capacity deficit. Due to leaks and a deficit in pumping capacity, water pressure drops&#13;
during the peak load hours so that the upper floors do not get cold water4. This&#13;
problem is worse in the suburban areas where the buildings are higher, but it affects&#13;
also the upper floors in the city center5; b) numerous service disruptions due to old and&#13;
corroded piping. A substantial part of the city center piping was installed in the late&#13;
1800s and early 1900s; c) inadequate wastewater treatment capacity. Treatment covers&#13;
only 2/3 of the waste water output. There are some 400 open untreated sewage outlets&#13;
to Neva River of which about 200 are located in the city center area, many visible right&#13;
6&#13;
from the embankment between the statue of Peter the First and the Hermitage; and d)&#13;
20% of city center sewers leak and should be rehabilitated.&#13;
12. EC-TACIS has launched a comprehensive study of Vodokanal rehabilitation and&#13;
organizational restructuring. Finnish, Swedish and Danish foreign aid agencies have&#13;
financed training programs for Vodokanal personnel. German foreign aid has funded a&#13;
methodology study to eliminate the open sewer outlets in the city center. Vodokanal&#13;
The Hot water supply works since it is supplied from the district heating network.&#13;
5 Some relief to this problem is expected when the new pumping station "Parnass" financed from the proceeds&#13;
of the Bank's Housing Loan comes on line.&#13;
6 The Housing Project includes provision for a new collection system that will permit the closure of many of&#13;
these outlets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60&#13;
has started a computerized network locator program under assistance from the Finnish&#13;
Ministry of Environment and a US company support.&#13;
13.  Heating. Forty two percent of the heating in city center is supplied to consumers&#13;
by Lenenergo from their three heat and power plants in the city center (district&#13;
heating), 57 % by Lentek from their medium and small size boiler plants and from some&#13;
autonomous heating systems (block or individual heating). The fuel for Lenenergo's&#13;
and Lentek's heat sources in the center city is gas. Lentek's boiler plants consist of&#13;
some 500 old coal fired boilers that have been converted to gas, achieving therefore a&#13;
low (50-70%) annual efficiency. There are only about 20 autonomous modem gas&#13;
boilers for individual building heating (designed for gas and achieving some 85-90%&#13;
annual efficiency).&#13;
14. The district heating supply in the city has been arranged technically in a special&#13;
way. Heat is supplied through a two pipe network directly to buildings in the city&#13;
center and to heat exchanger stations with two pipe secondary networks (7-70 Gcal/h)&#13;
serving large building groups in subdivisions outside the city center. The domestic hot&#13;
water is tapped at the buildings directly from the district heating circuit. This renders&#13;
the usage of corrosion inhibitor chemicals in such networks impractical and aggravates&#13;
the corrosion problem.&#13;
15. The technology used for underground district heating pipes consists of steel pipes&#13;
with concrete foam thermal insulation and a bituminous layer jacket. The pipes are&#13;
buried directly (without channel) in the ground. Due to high ground water, the channel&#13;
method (used elsewhere in Russia) would be impractical (flooding). The average life of&#13;
such pipes in the ground is about 11 years. Fortunately, in the city center, a substantial&#13;
amount of the network is located in the building basements where the conditions are&#13;
generally better than in the ground.&#13;
16. Lentek operates some 500 gas fired local boiler houses for individual buildings and&#13;
building blocks (57% of the city center's heat demand). The heat distribution systems&#13;
of these boilers are local and run mostly inside the buildings and thereby reducing&#13;
corrosion.&#13;
17.  Electricity. All electricity distribution in the city center is operated by&#13;
Lenenergo, a privatized joint stock company. The city center peak load is some 700&#13;
MW, and there is a latent deficit of transmission and distribution capacity in the area.&#13;
Some new capacity will be needed for a modernized center city. Should major&#13;
construction activity begin, Lenenergo would need to intensify its program of changing&#13;
the distribution voltage from the present 6 kV to the 10 kV standard of Western&#13;
economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
61&#13;
18.  Street Lighting. Lensviet is a municipal organization that takes care of the&#13;
operation and maintenance of street lighting. Lensviet operates some 20,000 lighting&#13;
fixtures in the city center, 95 % of them are for street lighting and 5 % for decorative&#13;
lighting of some 100 buildings. In the city center, the total installed capacity of this&#13;
lighting is some 6 MW.&#13;
19.  Telephones. Telephone services are mainly owned and operated by St.&#13;
Petersburg Telephone Networks, a joint stock company owned jointly by the city&#13;
(43%), local banks (25%), employees (10%) and others. In October 1995 the city was&#13;
expected to sell a further stake, 10% of the share capital in an auction to private&#13;
investors. There are also three cellular companies and another private telephone&#13;
operator. St. Petersburg's telephone situation is expected to improve in 1996 when the&#13;
first stage (US$30m) of a US$60m program of St. Petersburg Telephone Networks will&#13;
be completed.&#13;

Annex 3&#13;
Sectoral Context&#13;
Real Estate&#13;
City Strategy and Description of Market&#13;
Summary of City Strategy&#13;
1.    The Government of St. Petersburg considers the rehabilitation of its historic&#13;
area to be its highest priority. The vision of its leaders is to restore and rehabilitate the&#13;
historic area to retain its present form, while making the city a lively center of&#13;
commerce, services, residences, culture, and entertainment. The goal is to complete&#13;
some major restoration works by 2003 in time for the 300th anniversary of the city's&#13;
founding. The City also hopes to be a serious competitor in selecting the site of the&#13;
Olympic Games to be held in the Year 2004.&#13;
2.    The cornerstone of the city's restoration strategy is to stimulate private&#13;
investment activity in the historic center. The private sector offers better prospects for&#13;
faster and more sustainable results in the rehabilitation of historic buildings, at least in&#13;
the short term. St. Petersburg has some successful examples of adaptive re-use of&#13;
historic buildings, including, for example the Nevsky Palace and Grand Europe hotels,&#13;
and the St. Petersburg Bank. Opportunities for private restoration are increasing. A&#13;
recent agreement was concluded between the Ministry of Culture of the Russian&#13;
Federation and the Governor of St. Petersburg to delegate more authority to St.&#13;
Petersburg's Committee on Historic Preservation in the preservation and maintenance&#13;
of historic landmarks -- including the privatization of historic structures of local&#13;
significance.&#13;
3.    However, thus far, the St. Petersburg authorities have promoted private&#13;
investment to foreign and domestic investors in an ad hoc manner. Results have been&#13;
slow in coming. It is now generally agreed that a comprehensive approach is required.&#13;
Such an approach will require a new flexible strategic plan for center city development,&#13;
an appropriate legal base, and a new financial policy.&#13;
4.    The city has made progress in all three of these areas. Regarding strategic&#13;
planning and financial services, the City's Committee for Finance and Economy has&#13;
completed preliminary work that will form the basis for a strategic plan; and they are&#13;
receiving support from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
(EBRD) for technical assistance on financial policies and general investment strategies.&#13;
The work completed thus far is based on overall economic considerations, but lacks a&#13;
spatial dimension and any specific infrastructure and sectoral investment&#13;
considerations. In addition, USAID has started providing technical assistance to&#13;
complete a strategic plan for the whole of St. Petersburg based on an approach that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64&#13;
features: a) flexibility to modify the plan based on continuous feedback and b) public&#13;
involvement in formulating the plan. A major consulting firm has been contracted to&#13;
undertake this effort in association with local consultants previously contracted by the&#13;
city for strategic economic and planning work. The scope of work for the strategic&#13;
plan focuses particularly on issues concerning the economic base and transportation,&#13;
and will propose a series of projects that can be financed. The city hopes that the plan&#13;
will be used to activate public and private initiative and support investments with short-&#13;
term results. Regarding the legal bases, the City's Property Committee has sponsored&#13;
major legislative initiatives to improve legal rights including improvements on&#13;
information availability and documentation for these sites for city property (see&#13;
discussion on regulation below). The City's Committee on Urban Services has started&#13;
work on improving promotion plan of major sites for building rehabilitation.&#13;
Center City Real Estate Market&#13;
5.    Summary. Compared to Moscow, St. Petersburg has had limited experience in&#13;
major real estate development. St. Petersburg has lower demand for high quality&#13;
apartments, office space, retail, hotels and industrial facilities than Moscow. The city&#13;
administration had adopted a slow-growth approach to real estate development as a&#13;
means of protecting the city's historic character. Although the gap with Moscow&#13;
seems to be closing, many submarkets, especially the one for office is where Moscow&#13;
was three or four years ago. One of the main differences is that there seems to be little&#13;
speculation in St. Petersburg; no "bubble" effect took place. Overall, the markets&#13;
appear to be in relative balance, with demand slightly ahead of supply. Deals are&#13;
closed when an opportunity matches a specific demand, resulting in an uneven pattern&#13;
of opportunistic redevelopment of the central city.&#13;
6.    The center city real estate market is best reviewed in terms of its specific&#13;
submarkets. The box reviews demand and supply issues in several submarkets.&#13;
Submarket  Demand                                Supply&#13;
Office      Exceeds supply, developing slowly.   Absorption appears relatively rapid,&#13;
Demand in '96 estimated at 0.06-0.08   but data is poor. Prices for high end&#13;
million square meters. Demand highest  space are stable at $500-$800/square&#13;

companies and financial institutions,  Financing for renovations (new&#13;
but increasing from Russian companies  construction is rare) typically by large&#13;
up-front rental payments by tenants.&#13;
Retail      Very sensitive to location and       Prices highest on Nevsky Prospekt (up&#13;
potentially more volatile. Tenants are  to $1000/square meter) where there are&#13;

dominate.                           counts. Leases are 5-10 years.&#13;
Residential  two tier market, affluent and       Highly segmented into pre-revolution,&#13;
affordable. Significant demand for  Stalin era, Krushchev era, new, and&#13;
apartnents to relocate families     fully rehabilitated. Absorption brisk.&#13;
presently in commnunal apartments.  Prices stable for 1.5 years. General&#13;
trend toward price increases for pre-&#13;
Revolutionary and rehabilitated&#13;
buildings; decreases for Stalin and&#13;
Khrushchev era stock. Higher end&#13;
apartments start at $1000 square meter&#13;
and go as high as $2500-$3000.&#13;
"Good" apartments are $600/square&#13;
meter and poor apartments are&#13;
$400/square meter.&#13;
Industrial   Modern industries want to be outside    Current stock is multi-story, low&#13;
the city center, near airport or in  ceiling, antiquated and on&#13;
Vyborgsky region. High demand for    contaminated sites. Significant&#13;
warehouses.                         industrial uses in center city. Quality&#13;
space is $200/m2; low quality -&#13;
100/m2 with short leases.&#13;
Hotels      Luxury hotels have good occupancies   Not many hotel development projects&#13;
and high rates, but high taxes and  are coming on line.&#13;
over-leveraging have reduced&#13;
cashflows.&#13;
7.    Feasibility. Profitabilities have been reported at 25-50% with a four year&#13;
payback, however reliable and consistent data are not available. Developers must&#13;
assume substantial risks that jeopardize returns, including uncertain site specifications,&#13;
high and unclear infrastructure costs, unclear property rights, difficult access to credit,&#13;
and uncertain timing to have all existing residents agree to relocate. In addition, the&#13;
lack of zoning in the City encourages negotiations with City officials for all phases of&#13;
development and permitting. These issues increase costs and tend to lengthen the&#13;
process, stretching payback periods and diminishing returns.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 4&#13;
The Federally Targeted Program for Historic Center Development and&#13;
Preservation&#13;
1.    Work started in the mid 1980's on a major renovation program for St. Petersburg. The&#13;
original concept was to rehabilitate at a cost of US$15 billion equivalent all the infrastructure&#13;
and structures in order to preserve St. Petersburg in its present architectural form. The&#13;
collapse of the Soviet Union and the centrally planned and funded economy made this plan&#13;
untenable. The plan was revised several times to reduce the cost to the federal government and&#13;
to recognize governmental decentralization and emergence of a market economy. Although the&#13;
latest revision is still undergoing final reviews, the Federal Government provided some R 40&#13;
billion (US $9 million)' during 1995 for renovation of specific historic monuments.&#13;
2.    The revised version of the program includes the following goals2&#13;
a)    Preservation of the architectural, cultural and historic heritage as functioning entities,&#13;

b)    Integration of St. Petersburg into the world economic system&#13;
c)    Improving the living standards of the population&#13;
d)    Providing the scientific and technical foundation for rehabilitation works&#13;
e)    Increasing private sector finance of reconstruction and rehabilitation&#13;
3.    The program anticipates rehabilitation in the historic center proper (including the center&#13;
city and the palace complexes in the suburbs) and development of major infrastructure systems&#13;
(e.g., seaports, airports, underground infrastructure and transportation) needed to support&#13;
historic area revitalization. This is clearly a very ambitious program (total cost of R 120&#13;
trillion or US$ 27 billion) that will be implemented over a long period (30 years).&#13;
Implementation of the first stage (1996-1998) is supposed to be financed with a federal&#13;
contribution of R. 550 billion (US$ 122 million), a city budgetary contribution of R 1190&#13;
billion (US $264 million) and non-budget funds (private investment and others of R 590 billion&#13;
(US$131 million ). The plan includes discussion of ways of raising non-budgetary investment,&#13;
including municipal bonds, contributions, foreign investment, private investment, leases and&#13;
1 This is the amount actually received. The amount budgeted was R 100 billion.&#13;

sales etc.; and points out that the most important loans from foreign investors (presumably&#13;
referring to the Bank) would be guaranteed by both the municipal and the federal government.&#13;
4.    The plan includes an economic analysis of the project in which benefits and costs are&#13;
identified and quantified. Benefits include: a) increased tourism revenues through a five fold&#13;
increase of internal tourism and three fold increase in foreign tourism; and b) increased tax&#13;
income to the city of 40%.&#13;
5.    The program is clearly ambitious in terms of its breadth and cost, especially&#13;
considering the critical shortage of public finance at both the federal and local levels. In&#13;
addition, the expert committee at the federal level that evaluated the program pointed out that&#13;
implementation arrangements are not defined sufficiently. However, many aspects of the&#13;
program are very encouraging: the program elaborates goals that are consistent with universal&#13;
human and cultural values (and the proposed Bank supported project), it recognizes the&#13;
importance of market based investment, it evaluates investments in economic terms, and it&#13;
demonstrates that the federal government is fully committed to historic area rehabilitation. The&#13;
Bank supported project should be viewed as an effort to assist the city in obtaining the&#13;
implementation capacity that it clearly needs to carry out this program in the future.&#13;

Annex 5&#13;
Financial Position of the City of St. Petersburg&#13;
Budget Deficits and City Debt&#13;
The city's short term debt position is worse than a typical western city because of the&#13;
unavailability of long term financing for capital improvements. The amount of principal required&#13;
to be paid in any year represents the city's total outstanding loans since the city does only short&#13;
term borrowing. The problem is especially serious because of the high interest rates - on the&#13;
order of 100 per cent - that the city pays on its debt.&#13;
At the beginning of 1996, the city had outstanding loans of US$254 million. In addition,&#13;
the city had accounts payable of US$ 210 million, or about 3 months' expenditures. By&#13;
September 1, the loan debt had risen to US$ 500 million. Interest on loan debt was US$ 130&#13;
million for the first six months of the year and expected interest for the full year is $270 million.&#13;
In 1995, interest on loans was $95 million. Interest is a major new expense for the city that it&#13;
cannot afford.&#13;
The city's debt has been growing rapidly and is now reaching crisis proportions.&#13;
Exclusive of debt repayment requirements, the city's deficit in 1995 was US$ 186 million while&#13;
a deficit of US$ 532 million is budgeted for 1996. It is likely that the city will reduce the 1996&#13;
deficit through reduced spending. Results from the first six months of the year indicate that both&#13;
revenues and expenditures are growing more slowly than planned. Officials in the city's Finance&#13;
Committee have indicated that a balanced budget is being prepared for 1997.&#13;
The 1995 deficit was 11 % of revenue while the 1996 deficit will be 24% of revenue&#13;
under the budget plan. City revenues in 1995 were about US$1.6 billion with US$ 2.2 billion&#13;
expected in 1996. Capital expenditures were US$200 million in 1995 and are expected to be&#13;
US$270 million in 1996.&#13;
City Revenue 1994- 1996&#13;
Table 1 shows the city revenue for the years 1994 - 1996. Actual figures are given for&#13;
1994 and 1995 and plans for 1996. Table 2 shows each source as a percentage of the total for the&#13;
year Table 3 shows planned and actual performance for 1996. In dollar terms, the city's&#13;
revenues grew by 6 % between 1994 and 1995 while expenditures increased by 19%. The city&#13;
has increased its reliance on local taxes (i.e., taxes for which the city sets the rates and defines the&#13;
base), while decreasing its reliance on the local portion of federal taxes. Revenue growth in 1996&#13;
is expected to be 36% with expenses growing by 45%. First half results show that the city was&#13;
about 4% short of its revenue target. The city's revenue position has been adversely affected by&#13;
the fall in local business and manufacturing activity, a reduction in the corporate tax rate,&#13;
diversion of 10 per cent of the income tax to the Russian Federation and the failure of wages to&#13;
keep up with inflation. The city has off-set this with increases in property and housing taxes.&#13;

Expenditures increased by 19% between 1995 and 1994 and by 51 % between 1995&#13;
and the 1996 budget plan in dollar terms. It is difficult to compare years because the&#13;
budget presentation from year to year is different. Recently EBRD has been funding work&#13;
designed to improve the financial reporting of the city. Under this project, a major&#13;

international accounting firm has reformulated the city's financial statements for the&#13;
period 1993 - 1996. These statements provide for inflation adjustments and dollar&#13;
conversions as well as attempting to provide for consistent classification of categories of&#13;
expenses from year to year.'&#13;

Financial Improvement Measures&#13;
Introduction. St. Petersburg must continue to make progress in improving its&#13;
financial management before considering additional loans from the Bank.. This will also&#13;
be necessary for the city to issue private debt at reasonable interest rates. Improvements&#13;
will be necessary in reducing the city's deficits, budgeting, financial reporting and cash&#13;
management. In most areas, the city has made a start but following the initiatives through&#13;
to completion will be difficult.&#13;
Measures regarding Financial Position.&#13;
The city has initiated deficit reduction efforts through both revenue improvement&#13;
and expenditure reduction. The governor has issued a forty four point program to&#13;
improving the city's revenues. This program requires that city departments and&#13;
committees complete and submit a number of reports and draft legislation before the end&#13;
of 1996.. The governor's program covers every aspect of revenues - taxes, leases, user&#13;
charges and gambling. The changes are expected to result in increased revenue of 1,020&#13;
billion rubles a year (almost US$200 million).&#13;
Some of the principal components of the program are:&#13;
i.    Modifying the law on tax privileges to bring in an extra 95 billion&#13;
rubles (US $ equivalent) a year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74&#13;
ii.   Increasing leasing fees to bring in an additional 126 billion rubles a&#13;
year. (always include US equivalent)&#13;
iii.    Creating a road maintenance fund to bring in 400 billion rubles a year&#13;
iv.    Developing fees for trading to bring in 84 billion rubles a year.&#13;
In addition, the governor is pressing for expenditure reductions. Two areas that&#13;
are expected to be implemented in the coming year includes: a) the introduction of&#13;
contracting with private firms for specific tasks such as maintenance; and b) requiring&#13;
that utilities become financially self-sufficient.&#13;
Measures Regarding Financial Management&#13;
The city is working to improve its cash management and borrowing operations.&#13;
To do this adequately, it must: develop cash flow forecasts that will provide daily,&#13;
monthly and annual projections; improve its ability to produce accurate, meaningful and&#13;
timely financial statements; consolidate information on cash flow and debt management&#13;
for all city operations; and develop improved methods for budgeting and accounting for&#13;
debt and interest payments. The city is considering establishing a centralized treasury&#13;
function that will simplify this task but no final decision has been made.&#13;
The city has also been working for several years to improve its financial reporting.&#13;
For instance, reporting of debt changed in 1995 so it is no longer reported as a revenue.&#13;
The city meets Russian statutory requirements but these policies are not always consistent&#13;
2&#13;
with generally accepted accounting practices .&#13;
Budgeting is another area that needs attention. The city should produce&#13;
meaningful budgets that clearly distinguish between capital and operating expenses.&#13;
Budgets with large deficits that must be adjusted continually during the year, as now&#13;
happens, are not adequate tools for financial management. Formats should be agreed&#13;
upon between the legislature and the administration to ensure that everyone understands&#13;
what is taking place. The city has tried several formats and now needs to settle on a&#13;
uniform presentation. The city undertook an exercise earlier in the year under the EBRD&#13;
program that required city departments to produce budget and tariff proposals designed to&#13;
reduce the deficit but there was little follow up and the results have been slower than&#13;
expected. This may be due to the changes in the city administration.&#13;
2 as is the case with privatized enterprises and most municipalities in industrialized countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
75&#13;
In addition to the areas already mentioned, there are several areas in which the&#13;
city's financial reporting could be improved. These include:&#13;
I.    Monitoring short term loans of entities such as committees, departments&#13;
and districts.&#13;
2.    Recognizing accrued expenditures; in other words recognizing expenses as&#13;
they are incurred and reporting accounts payable on a regular basis&#13;
3.    Developing a financial system that will allow for independent audits of the&#13;
city's financial statements&#13;
4.    Clearly identifying capital expenditures as a separate item in the budget&#13;
using commonly accepted definitions. Equipment provided for new&#13;
construction and reconstruction are not considered capital expenditures.&#13;
5.    Recognizing interest and financing fees when they are incurred and&#13;
providing for full disclosure of the results of trading in the city's&#13;
securities.&#13;
6.    Identifying non-recurring revenue items&#13;
7.    Producing easily understandable reports to the public on a quarterly basis.&#13;

additional studies. Data collection will be done by the Leontiev Center. A separate budget is&#13;
provided for the data collection.&#13;
b.  Using the Strategic Plan for the entire city as a base, develop a land use, transport,&#13;
cultural and economic plan for the central city area that reflects the role of the center city in the&#13;
city economy. This plan should take the federally targeted program for the "Historical&#13;
Preservation of the Center City" into account as well as work done on the plans for general city&#13;
development. The consultant should carefully review work done to date and discuss current&#13;
planning activities with appropriate city committees and with the appropriate ministries of the&#13;
federal government. The plan should include short (1-3 years), medium (5 -10 years) and long&#13;
range objectives that can realistically be achieved given the resources available. It should be&#13;
based on reasonable, achievable socio-economic goals and realistic estimates of funds that can be&#13;
made available over the period. The plan should be developed in stages with considerable&#13;
opportunity for discussion and input from all interested parties. It should include a basic indicator&#13;
system to measure progress against the plan. The objective is to prepare plans that will be useful&#13;
to both the city and the Federal Government in implementing the Federally Targeted Program.&#13;

This planning should include a simplified Geographic Information System that will comprise&#13;
several layers of data including financial, economic, land use, building conditions, identification&#13;
of historical structures and social data. To develop this system, the consultant will review the&#13;
existing system that is under development to determine if it can be useful for planning in the next&#13;
six months. If not, the consultant will prepare a budget for purchasing equipment and software&#13;
and training staff to use a simpler system.&#13;
d.  Identify key obstacles to development of private and public investment. Some may&#13;

residents and businesses in the center city, governmental organisations, representatives of donor&#13;
agencies and research and professional groups with an interest in the center city. Within the first&#13;
two months of the project, the consultant should develop a structured program for the&#13;
involvement of these groups. The program should provide a mechanism for enhancing co-&#13;
operation between city agencies and between city agencies and the public.&#13;
16.   In addition to involving community groups the consultant should provide for close co-&#13;
ordination and collaboration between service agencies, construction agencies and finance&#13;
agencies of the city government. This should be done through wide spread dissemination of&#13;
written materials and convening meetings of all agencies involved in particular aspects of the&#13;
project.&#13;
17.   The consultant should not dictate single solutions but, whenever possible, the consultant&#13;
should prepare alternatives for city and federal decisions. The evaluation of the alternatives&#13;
should include consideration of historical, architectural, economic, financial and social factors.&#13;
18. The Project will pay close attention to building institutions that are capable of planning,&#13;
implementing, regulating and promoting historic area renovations for the long run.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Budget&#13;
19.   A budget of US$9.8 million has been set aside for this consultancy . This is divided into&#13;
an allocation of US$5.6 for design and engineering and US$4.2 for the remaining work. In&#13;
addition to this consultancy contract, additional funds have been provided to the Leontiev Center,&#13;
the Fund for Development of Real Estate and to the Center for Operation of Bank Projects to&#13;
cover additional administrative, data gathering and other costs; donor finance is available for&#13;
consultants to be designated for complementary technical assistance.&#13;
Staffing&#13;
20.   The Consultant's proposal should indicate the positions that are to be filled along with&#13;
CV's for key personnel. It is expected that the project will require approximately the following&#13;
levels of effort. However, the consultant may propose less or more positions or a different&#13;
staffing pattern. Most of these positions will be short time. It will be advantageous if the required&#13;
skills can be combined to reduce the number of individual positions. Expected positions to be&#13;
filled by qualified persons include:&#13;

Annex 7&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Strategic Plan for St. Petersburg&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
During the transformation period of the social and economic systems in Russia, the creation of a&#13;
favorable investment climate is vital and essential for the development of the St. Petersburg&#13;
region. The office of the Governor of St. Petersburg is paying close attention to the interrelated&#13;
issues of city management and strategic planning.&#13;
A concept of the development of a strategic plan for the city of St. Petersburg was developed by&#13;
the Leontiev Center in 1995, based on the following principles:&#13;
a.    ongoing work in preparation and revision of a development strategy;&#13;
b.    highly professional strategy justification, with the integration of city leadership&#13;
into the decision making process; and&#13;
C.    development of a prioritized agenda of concrete action programs based no realistic&#13;
implementation.&#13;
The Strategic Plan should provide the basis for the development of St. Petersburg into a multi-&#13;
functional European city, a transport juncture and scientific, educational and cultural center,&#13;
integrated into the world economy. Most important, it should provide a realistic approach to the&#13;
city's development of increasingly high living standards for the inhabitants..&#13;
St. Petersburg should not just become a "window to Europe" but an integral part of Europe and a&#13;
major center of the Baltic Region and the North-West of Russia. The plan will support the&#13;
achievement of theses goals by addressing the issues of maintaining social stability and&#13;
improvement of quality of life. For the city center, tourism infrastructure development is of the&#13;
top priorities.&#13;
In 1995, the results of the development study of the Leontiev Center were published in a&#13;
document entitled;&#13;
"A Socio-Economic Development Strategy for the City of St. Petersburg (an Invitation&#13;
for Discussion)".&#13;
This document was published with the intent to stimulate the discussion process leading to the&#13;
formulation of an organization devoted to the development of a Strategic Plan for the City of St.&#13;
Petersburg.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
92&#13;
The strategy is to ensure common understanding of social and economic goals, and potential&#13;
directions for development. To accomplish this goal an appropriate context for dialogue and&#13;
constructive contacts will be established between city authorities, managers of companies,&#13;
investors, developers, condominium associations, and social institutions. This process will begin&#13;
the moment the Head of the City Administration approves the plan for the Strategic Plan.&#13;
2. SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
The program outlined in these Terms of Reference is the logical next step. USAID grant funding&#13;
directed to this effort will be utilized to establish a planning organization which will develop the&#13;
basis for a Strategic Plan for the City of St. Petersburg. We envision that the planning effort&#13;
which is initiated through use of this USAID funding will evolve into a permanent city&#13;
government planning department similar to that found in most of the world's great cities.&#13;
The principal challenges facing the city in development of the Strategic Plan are:&#13;
_ structural transformation of the economy, employment issues&#13;
* inefficient municipal services&#13;
* poverty levels and increased differentiation of incomes&#13;
- housing shortage&#13;
* budget deficit&#13;
The Strategic Plan will address these challenges by defining social and economic policies,&#13;
principles of spatial development by city zones and by defining a framework for institutional&#13;
development.&#13;
This vision is facilitated by the reality of the upcoming World Bank financed St. Petersburg&#13;
Center City Rehabilitation Project. The work performed with these grant funds will be closely&#13;
coordinated with World Bank personnel developing the workscope for the St. Petersburg Center&#13;
City Rehabilitation Project, which will ensure transition and continuity of the planning process&#13;
when the center City project begins.&#13;
The work will consist of the following major phases:&#13;
a.    mobilize staff and facilities in St. Petersburg;&#13;
b.    schedule and conduct management level meetings at each city department to&#13;
identify development priorities;&#13;
c.    validate priorities;&#13;
d.    presentation of goals to City Administration;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
93&#13;
e.    development of Strategic Plan (prioritized)&#13;
f.    presentation of Plan to City Administration&#13;
The following is detailed description of the activities of each of the phases, which will be&#13;
performed in sequence.&#13;
A. Mobilization of Staff and Facilities&#13;
*The work will be performed in the City of St. Petersburg. The Project Director is Dr. Leaned&#13;
Limonov, Director Coordinator of Research Projects for the Leontiev Center St. Petersburg. Dr.&#13;
Limonov will be assisted by a multi-national staff consisting of personnel, as needed, from&#13;
Leontiev Center, Parsons International and sub-consultants.&#13;
Mobilization will occur in mid-July. Approximately 300 sq. meters of office space will be&#13;
required in central St. Petersburg. This space will be either an existing city government building&#13;
or in leased space in a commercial office building. Office equipment, including a computer&#13;
network, telephone system, copiers and fax machines will be procured for the project. The&#13;
project will need one vehicle. We will transfer one (1) vehicle, (7 passenger Dodge Caravan&#13;
minivan) from the Military Housing Project to the St. Petersburg office.&#13;
B. Schedule and Conduct Management Level Meetings&#13;
After mobilization, a series of "stake holders" meetings will be held with residents, city&#13;
government agencies, private developers and investors, cultural institutions and donors. The&#13;
purpose of these meetings will be to obtain priorities for development and reconstruction from a&#13;
wide range of participants. These meetings will be at the spokesman or managerial level with&#13;
stake holder institutions and organization. These meetings will be organized and conducted&#13;
primarily by staff of the Leontiev Center, under the direction of Dr. Limonov. Priorities will be&#13;
categorized into various social, economic, infrastructure and development categories. The result&#13;
of this work will be listings of development goals and objectives from a diverse spectrum of&#13;
groups within the community.&#13;
C. Validate Priorities&#13;
Development and reconstruction priorities identified by stake holders will be validated by social,&#13;
financial, and economic and technical engineering experts. During this validation phase,&#13;
urban/regional planners, engineers and architects from Parsons and our subconsultants, as well as&#13;
financial and economic subconsultants will participate. The result of this phase will be&#13;
identification and ranking of valid development priorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
94&#13;
D. Presentation&#13;
Upon completion of the validation phase, a highly professional presentation will be held for the&#13;
city administration, detailing the methodology and results of the identification and prioritization&#13;
of development objectives. This presentation will provide an explanation of how the&#13;
development objectives will form the basis for the Strategic Plan. The objective of this&#13;
presentation will be to provide an understanding of the planning process and to gain approval and&#13;
"buyin" by the city administration.&#13;
E. Development of the Strategic Plan&#13;
The development priorities obtained in prior phases will be used as the basis for the strategic&#13;
plan. The plan will encompass the broad spectrum of city needs, including infrastructure,&#13;
commercial, residential and industrial facilities, economic development, with particular emphasis&#13;
on the center city, transportation planning, financial planning and development of a legal and&#13;
economic framework for historic preservation.&#13;
During this phase of the project, the team will determine ways to meet the main transitional&#13;
challenges faced by the city through,&#13;
* combining the socio-economic and spatial approaches to planning&#13;
- involving the city's public and business communities in decisions&#13;
* transforming strategic decisions into specific actions and programs&#13;
v assuring the recovery potential and/or social importance of investment&#13;
This phase will include, but not limited to the following major activities.&#13;
*  Data collection and analysis will include development of a central data base which catalogs&#13;
previous studies and reports. A reference center will be established with copies of all&#13;
documents available, organized by economic segment and/or facility, as related to planning.&#13;
*  Identification of development priorities in the Strategic, Plan Concept.&#13;
+  Preparation of Strategic Programs.&#13;
+  Discussion of the Plan.&#13;
+  Development of specific requirements for Plan monitoring.&#13;
2. A specific program will be formulated for economic development, with particular reference to&#13;
the center city. This will include an assessment of the city's strengths and weaknesses from an&#13;
economic development standpoint, and will contain recommended types of economic activities&#13;
which will be developed and steps necessary to realize the potential. The specific employment&#13;
and income gains as well as costs, including social and environmental costs will be included.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
95&#13;
3. A general transportation plan for the city will be developed, which contains specific&#13;
recommendations for the center city. The transportation plan will take all modes of transport into&#13;
account and will provide cost estimates and identify priorities for economic development. Costs&#13;
will include social and environmental costs.&#13;
4. A public utilities development plan will be developed, taking into account existing&#13;
demographics, the state of existing facilities and needs to support planned growth and&#13;
development. This plan will include cost estimates and will be prioritized to support the&#13;
economic development plan.&#13;
5. The legal and economic environment for historic preservation will be developed, to include&#13;
cost and revenue estimates, administrative procedures and relocation requirements.&#13;
6. A comprehensive review of the city's finances will be undertaken, to set out a realistic cost&#13;
envelope for financing services and capital development, building on work already accomplished&#13;
by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and studies undertaken by others.&#13;
Particular emphasis will be given to priorities identified by various stakeholder organization, and&#13;
continuous coordination with these groups is envisioned during preparation of the plan. During&#13;
the plan preparation stage, a trip will be organized to a major European city which has a recently&#13;
conducted a strategic plan and has an active full time Planning Department. Candidate cities&#13;
include Barcelona, Spain and/or Prague, Czech Republic. The field trip will be coordinated with&#13;
planning officials in the visiting city, and will include comprehensive discussions concerning&#13;
strategic plan development, the legal framework for city planning and plan enforcement, and&#13;
ongoing planning activities. Key decision makers from the City of St. Petersburg and&#13;
stockholder organizations will be included in the field trip.&#13;
F. Presentation of the Strategic Plan&#13;
Upon completion of the Strategic Plan, a phased presentation structure will be initiated. The&#13;
initial presentation will be to the City Administration, for approval and comment. Upon&#13;
preliminary approval of the City Administration, the plan will be presented to the city, via a&#13;
meeting/presentation to major city stakeholders. A comment period will be allowed wherein the&#13;
public will be invited to provide comments to the planning team. Comments will be compiled,&#13;
catalogued and published by the planning team. After comments are taken into consideration, a&#13;
final plan will be developed for approval by the city administration.&#13;

Annex 9&#13;
Principles of Tenant Relocation&#13;
1.    The housing stock in the center of St. Petersburg continues to deteriorate at an alarming&#13;
rate. Much of that stock is found in buildings of great architectural and historical significance,&#13;
making rehabilitation a matter not only of living standards, but also of preservation of the city's&#13;
invaluable architectural heritage. The city is committed to rehabilitating the deteriorating housing&#13;
stock, but is incapable of doing so without enormous investment of scarce public resources or,&#13;
alternatively, encouragement of private investment.&#13;
2.    Most deteriorating housing in the center of the city is social housing presently in the&#13;
ownership of the city, and most of that housing is in the form of communal apartments. Most&#13;
tenants are persons of limited financial means. Even where deteriorated housing units have been&#13;
privatized, it is likely that the new owners lack the means to perform needed rehabilitation.&#13;
Given the scarcity of public resources at this time and the need to provide an adequate return to&#13;
private investment, it is therefore inevitable that the strategic plan for rehabilitation of the&#13;
historic center of St. Petersburg will include some change from residential to commercial uses&#13;
and from lower quality housing to higher quality housing, and that such changes will result in&#13;
relocation of some present tenants and owners.&#13;
3.    In the context of the St. Petersburg Center City Rehabilitation Loan Project the World&#13;
Bank has discussed with city authorities the requirements of the World Bank regarding&#13;
relocation. The present policies and procedures of the city and the Russian Federation are fully&#13;
in accord with those requirements in spirit and in law. It has always been and remains the policy&#13;
of the city that relocation is to be undertaken as a last resort, and is to be accomplished with&#13;
maximum respect for the economic rights and social needs of the affected citizens. The laws of&#13;
the Russian Federation erect stringent standards for relocation of tenants of social housing. As a&#13;
rule, where relocation occurs by municipal initiative, Russian law requires:&#13;
*     relocation only in cases of severe housing deterioration constituting a threat&#13;
to health or safety or threatening irreparable deterioration of the housing&#13;
stock;&#13;
*     implementation of relocation through voluntary means whenever possible;&#13;
*     relocation standards based upon a minimum space standard and almost&#13;
invariably better housing conditions;&#13;
*     providing relocatees with a suitable choice among several relocation&#13;
opportunities.&#13;
4.    Rehabilitation of the center of St. Petersburg is a vast project which will be accomplished&#13;
over an extended period of time. It is not possible at this time to define all of the projects in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
100&#13;
which relocation may be necessary. Moreover, only a small portion of the work contemplated&#13;
now will be undertaken with the assistance of the World Bank. Nevertheless, the city is&#13;
committed to establishing, with the ongoing assistance of the World Bank in the context of the&#13;
Center City Rehabilitation Project, a comprehensive policy toward relocation.&#13;
5.    In all projects to be undertaken with the assistance of the Center City Rehabilitation Loan&#13;
from the World Bank, the following principles will be applied:&#13;
*  Relocation will be permitted only in those instances specified in the laws of the&#13;
Russian Federation and the City of St. Petersburg.&#13;
*  Relocation will proceed in accordance with the procedures of relocation specified in&#13;
the laws of the Russian Federation and the City of St. Petersburg.&#13;
*  Project planning will seek to minimize relocation, voluntary or involuntary.&#13;
*  Relocation will occur only in accordance with a plan of relocation prepared by the&#13;
city or approved by the city in the process of awarding redevelopment project&#13;
opportunities to private investors.&#13;
*  To prevent speculation and ineligible claims and to assist in evaluating relocation&#13;
plans, relocation needs will be evaluated early in the planning process, before project&#13;
announcement, through appropriate socio-economic surveys&#13;
*  Voluntary agreements are viewed by the city as the best assurance of fair market&#13;
evaluation of tenants' economic rights. The first approach to tenant relocation will be&#13;
through voluntary agreements negotiated between the designated redeveloper of a&#13;
building and the tenants.&#13;
*  Though private negotiation will be main principle of relocation, the city recognizes&#13;
that it has the ultimate responsibility to assure through appropriate supervision and&#13;
monitoring that relocation is carried out in accordance with the established policies.&#13;
*  Relocation on the basis of cash settlements alone will not be permitted except in&#13;
those cases where it is the clearly expressed preference of the tenant. Relocation will&#13;
be based on the principle of assisting those persons to be relocated to find&#13;
replacement housing of better condition and equal value.&#13;
*  All efforts will be made to relocate tenants near to transportation to their places of&#13;
employment and to avoid commuting times which are unreasonable in light of the&#13;
prevailing standards of St. Petersburg.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
101&#13;
*   In the case of the elderly in particular, all reasonable efforts will be made to relocate&#13;
the tenants to the vicinity of their former homes.&#13;
* In no case will the alternative dwelling premises provided fall below the required&#13;
minimum space per person as defined in the housing standards of the Russian&#13;
Federation and the City of St. Petersburg, whichever is greater.&#13;
*   In accordance with Russian Federation law, relocation benefits will be extended to&#13;
all persons residing in housing under rights of "naym"1 or ownership. Members of&#13;
extended families residing together will be offered relocation as a unit in accordance&#13;
with applicable space standards. In accordance with present law, persons occupying&#13;
housing units in violation of the laws of the Russian Federation who are not members&#13;
of the extended family will be relocated to housing which is equivalent to the&#13;
housing that they are presently occupying.&#13;
*   It is the policy of the city to preserve a social and economic mix in the city center to&#13;
the maximum extent possible given scarce city resources. To preserve a social and&#13;
economic mix of citizens in the city's center, the city will explore the potential for&#13;
developing or rehabilitating relocation housing in the city center, giving particular&#13;
attention to the elderly and persons whose health needs require that they remain in&#13;
the place.&#13;
*   Relocation efforts will be based upon full disclosure of plans to affected citizens at&#13;
appropriate times in the redevelopment process and continuing communication with&#13;
affected citizens and their representatives throughout the relocation process. The&#13;
policy of the city is to involve the affected citizens in the relocation process to the&#13;
maximum feasible extent.&#13;
*   The city will provide or require provision of services and mechanisms to reduce or&#13;
avoid conflict and to assure that the relocation process will be carried out with all due&#13;
regard for the economic and personal rights of the tenants. Included arnong the&#13;
proposed mechanisms will be the services of professionals or organizations with&#13;
expertise in conflict resolution and assistance to the tenants to organize appropriate&#13;
representative councils.&#13;
*   Involuntary relocation will proceed only as a last resort and only in cases where (1)&#13;
the building to be reconstructed is deteriorated and poses a threat to health and safety&#13;
or threatens irreparable deterioration to the housing stock if not addressed through&#13;
comprehensive reconstruction, as determined under the laws of the City; (2) all&#13;
efforts have been exhausted to reach a negotiated agreement; and (3) the demands of&#13;
'"Naym" is the Russian term given to long-term rights of use.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
102&#13;
the tenant lack an economic basis under the prevailing standards of St. Petersburg.&#13;
In no case will involuntary relocation proceed without court judgment as provided in&#13;
the laws of Russian Federation and the City of St. Petersburg.  Involuntary&#13;
relocation will not affect the rights of the relocated tenant or the quality of housing to&#13;
which he is entitled under the law.&#13;
* All relocation efforts undertaken in connection with World Bank assisted projects&#13;
will be closely monitored by the city with the assistance of the World Bank and&#13;
evaluated on the basis of the established policies.&#13;
* The city will work with the World Bank in the context of the Center City&#13;
Rehabilitation Project and any future projects to further define and develop its&#13;
relocation polices on the basis of experimentation with innovative concepts and&#13;
lessons learned in project implementation.&#13;

Annex 10&#13;
STATEMENT OF CITY POLICY IN THE SPHERE OF&#13;
IMMOVABLE PROPERTY (REAL) PROPERTY LEGISLATION&#13;
To:   Mr. Jonathan Brown&#13;
The World Bank&#13;
Re: St. Petersburg Center City Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Dear Mr. Brown:&#13;
The government of St. Petersburg understands that in order to obtain the Center&#13;
City Rehabilitation loan further development of the nornative (regulatory) and legislative&#13;
framework in the sphere of the (urban) city real estate market is necessary.&#13;
Development of a comprehensive local legislative framework is rather a&#13;
complicated task. Development of important urban policies regarding housing, land&#13;
relationships and municipal finance is within the authority of the federal Government and&#13;
it affects the development of city programs-proper.&#13;
In St. Petersburg the process of reforn is ongoing and not only the city&#13;
administration, but also Legislative Assembly and business community are actively&#13;
participating, and each of them play an important role. Significant progress in the&#13;
development of a modern legislative and regulatory framework for the real estate market&#13;
has been achieved. Housing reform - an important factor for normal functioning of the&#13;
urban economy and one of the major principles in developing the city's financial plan is&#13;
an example.&#13;
The following steps have been taken recently:&#13;
* The comprehensive city program "Zhilishche" (Housing) on reform of the entire&#13;
housing sector has been prepared on the basis of the Federal program;&#13;
* Began a program to encourage and support creation of associations of home owners,&#13;
and to date associations have been created in over 30 buildings;&#13;
* Began a program to support management and maintenance tenders for city housing&#13;
stock, including creation of a coordination committee within the city administration.&#13;
*  Before other cities of Russia, began a program of transferring land into (private)&#13;
ownership. More than 400 land parcels have been transferred into ownership of&#13;
privatized enterprises, and approximately 500 applications are under consideration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
104&#13;
* In conformity with the privatization program of the Russian Federation, privatization&#13;
of approximately 95% of city-owned retail space has been completed.&#13;
* Implemented a program of registration of rights to and transactions with privately&#13;
owned real estate, including housing, land and commercial buildings.&#13;
Currently in preparation are additional actions concerning reorganization of the&#13;
city administrative structures dealing with management and maintenance of the housing&#13;
stock; normative acts regulating relations between residential home owners and the users&#13;
of non-residential spaces are being adopted, as well as normative acts concerning city&#13;
participation in repair and maintenance costs of buildings under the management of home&#13;
owners associations.&#13;
It should be noted that most of these initiatives were taken in the absence of&#13;
federal legislation on these issues, and at the same time in total conformity with the city's&#13;
obligations under the housing loan from the World Bank. All this is an evidence that the&#13;
city is serious regarding its obligations under agreements with the Bank.&#13;
In the future, the city intends to continue work in the housing sphere and also&#13;
focus its attention on further improvement in urban development policies and&#13;
development of real estate markets. Significant proposals are under preparation for the&#13;
nearest future:&#13;
Reform of Housing and Communal Services:&#13;
*  further support for creation of home owners associations through training programs&#13;
for city departments and home owners and development of a model charter of&#13;
associations:&#13;
* an accelerated program to turn condominium housing management and maintenance&#13;
responsibility over to private companies;&#13;
*  contacting of management and maintenance of housing through competitive tenders,&#13;
and redirection of housing subsidies from municipal housing maintenance companies&#13;
directly to condominiums;&#13;
*  a program on tariff increases for communal services charges to the level of actual&#13;
costs, coupled with implementation of targeted housing subsidies (housing&#13;
allowances) to persons most in need;&#13;
Support for Creation of Real Estate Markets:&#13;
* further development of the system of registration of private property rights to real&#13;
estate;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
105&#13;
* adoption of the law on protection of private investments in the real estate sphere,&#13;
which is presently in draft form and under the supervision of the City Real Estate&#13;
Commission with active involvement of the city's business community;&#13;
* introduction of a system of market appraisal of real estate offered to private sector;&#13;
* use of market appraisal to determine reasonable infrastructure development fees on a&#13;
case by case basis, and reduction in infrastructure development fees on the whole;&#13;
* development of normative acts on privatization of city-owned buildings of&#13;
architectural and historical significance;&#13;
*  development of normative acts on granting of permits for land use, construction and&#13;
commissioning of newly completed buildings ready for use and occupancy;&#13;
* development of better normative acts and documents on leasing urban or municipal&#13;
land for development; and&#13;
* development of optimal normative acts on urban development and functional zoning&#13;
or territories, drafts of which have been completed and under active discussion by the&#13;
administration and the Legislative Assembly.&#13;
The most recent regulations of the city and proposals under discussion by the city&#13;
administration are shown on the attached chart.&#13;
Considering the complexities of the political and legislative process in Russia it is&#13;
not possible to assure that each of these initiatives will be accomplished on schedule. It is&#13;
also possible that further developments of a legal or economic nature may lead to&#13;
reconsideration of some items on the program. However, the city administration will&#13;
carry out the planned reforms of vital necessity to the city's development.&#13;

RE:           St. Petersburg: Progress On Housing Loan Regulatory Action Program as&#13;
of            June 1, 1996&#13;
DATE:         June 15,1996&#13;
In connection with the recent World Bank mission to St. Petersburg from May 13&#13;
through May 25, 1966 I reviewed the city's progress on meeting the terms of the Housing&#13;
Program Regulatory Action Program ("RAP"). I was able to gather information on most aspects&#13;
of the RAP and my general conclusion is that the city has complied with the RAP is all material&#13;
respects.  The reasons for my conclusion are set out below.   Also set out are my&#13;
recommendations for issues needing attention during the next phase of the housing loan.&#13;
Pertinent to consideration of the city's compliance with the RAP is my initial report&#13;
prepared at the time the housing loan was declared effective, dated April 10, 1995, which&#13;
focused on the essential conditions of title registration and land privatization procedures. A copy&#13;
of that report is attached as Appendix A of this memorandum.&#13;
Also pertinent to the issue is the schedule of legislative initiatives proposed by the city&#13;
for consideration in the coming year, which is attached as Appendix B of this memorandum.&#13;
Registration of Rights To Real Estate&#13;
The city was required to demonstrate an adequate system of title registration prior to&#13;
loan effectiveness, which it did. Further development and refinement of the system is a long&#13;
term process which the city continues to implement. The requirements of the St. Petersburg&#13;
RAP in the sphere of registration of rights to real estate and an update of the city's progress&#13;
follows:&#13;
Objective: To create and implement the technical and legal basis for registration and protection&#13;
ofproperty interests in land and other real estate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
108&#13;
Task 1: Preparation of laws regulating title registration.&#13;
The city has substantially met its obligations under this task. It adopted its local&#13;
regulations on registration of rights to real estate as outlined in my report to Mrs. Nassau,&#13;
attached. The regulations establish a comprehensive basis for registration of real estate titles.&#13;
The relevant city regulations include the Order of the Mayor of St. Petersburg No. 1329-p, On&#13;
State Registration/Record Keening of Real Estate On the Territory of St. Petersburg, December&#13;
29, 1994, and accompanying appendices.&#13;
There is not yet a city law on registration of rights to real estate, partially due to the&#13;
delay at the federal level, where the proposed law on registration was approved by the State&#13;
Duma in its third reading only on July 19, 1996. It is anticipated that the national registration&#13;
law will be adopted by the Federal Council and signed by the President in the near future, which&#13;
may resolve the underlying issues in this sphere.  In anticipation of this event, the City&#13;
commissioned the Fund for Development of the City Real Estate Market to prepare a draft city&#13;
law of registration, which has been completed and is presently in circulation for comment.&#13;
Task 2: Selection of a design for the title registration system.&#13;
The city has an active program of registration of rights to land and real estate objects.&#13;
The system created by the city is under the supervision of the City Committee On Land&#13;
Resources and Management, but is comprised of two separate registries - one for rights to&#13;
residential property and another for all other rights.&#13;
Rights to residential property are registered by the Municipal Bureau For Housing&#13;
Registration, which, using local firms, developed a sophisticated software system for registration&#13;
which has been fully implemented at this time.&#13;
Rights to land and non-residential structures are registered by the district offices of the&#13;
local variant of the Bureau of Technical Inventory, using another software system developed by&#13;
the City Land Committee with the assistance of local firmns. The system has not yet been fully&#13;
implemented in all districts because of funding shortages, but the system design appears to be&#13;
well settled at this time. Further development of the system may be recommended in a review to&#13;
be undertaken by the City Land Committee and Swedesurvey under a grant from the Swedish&#13;
Govemment which has been offered as a component for the Word Bank's Center City&#13;
Rehabilitation Loan Project.&#13;
The existence at present of separate information systems for registration of housing and&#13;
all other real property may pose a problem at some point in the future if both systems are&#13;
integrated into a single city-wide system for registration of rights to all real property. On the&#13;
other hand, either system is capable of being extended to registration of all real estate, and the&#13;
present situation perhaps gives the opportunity for experimentation with competing systems.&#13;
Taskc 3: Implementation of title registration system in the project district.&#13;
This task has been completed. Title registration for residential property is carried out by&#13;
the Municipal Bureau for Housing Registration on a city-wide basis, including the district in&#13;
which the project site is located. Registration of land and non-residential structures is carried out&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
109&#13;
in the project district by the district office of the Land Committee (formerly the district offices&#13;
of the BTI). The office in the project district is presently operational.&#13;
Task 4: Training of staff&#13;
Staff training continues on an ongoing basis in both the Bureau of Housing Registration&#13;
and the Land Committee, as resources allow.&#13;
Task 5: Identification of existing land users and land plot boundaries.&#13;
The task of systematically identifying parcel boundaries and existing ownership rights is&#13;
a long term project that has begun under the direction of the City Land Committee. It is an&#13;
expensive process and the city lacks the resources to undertake it on a comprehensive basis.&#13;
Accordingly, the task is proceeding on a selective basis in certain key districts of the city. It is&#13;
likely that the first districts to be completed will be the four districts of the city's historic center,&#13;
where some work has already begun. Creation of procedures and the technical basis for&#13;
systematic identification of boundaries and users is part of the scope of work of the aid to be&#13;
provided to the City Land Committee by Swedesurvey under a grant of the Swedish Government&#13;
which is being offered as a component of the World Bank's Center City Rehabilitation Loan&#13;
Project.&#13;
Task 6: Integration of the district title registration system into a unified city-wide&#13;
system.&#13;
Considering the constraints caused by delay and confusion in federal law, the city has&#13;
substantially complied with this task. Creation of a unified system of registration for the entire&#13;
city has already been accomplished for residential property under the auspices of the Municipal&#13;
Bureau for Housing Registration. The Bureau is gradually opening new district offices in&#13;
selected locations which from the start will be fully integrated with the central system.&#13;
Registration of land and non-residential buildings is proceeding by district offices of the&#13;
City Land Committee (formerly BTI offices) and integration of the data from these offices is a&#13;
longer term process that has only begun. The City Land Committee has established a fully&#13;
integrated system as a principal objective and is pursuing the objective through various means,&#13;
including the ongoing technical assistance program offered by the Swedish Government&#13;
(Swedesurvey) under the auspices of the World Bank's Center City Rehabilitation Loan Project.&#13;
The issue of creating a single, unified system of registration for all forms of real estate -&#13;
which was an aspiration of the Regulatory Action Plan - is dependent upon many factors,&#13;
including the future development of the national legislation. The Director of the Municipal&#13;
Bureau of Housing Registration offers the opinion that the future real estate registry will be&#13;
created as an independent agency, meaning that it will be taken from the Land Committees&#13;
which presently have administrative and executive responsibilities for land privatization and&#13;
enforcement of land use restrictions. This is seen by many as a conflict of interest that will not&#13;
survive. In anticipation of that possibility, the Municipal Bureau of Housing Registration has&#13;
deliberately designed its system to be able to accommodate registration of all forms of real estate&#13;
and real estate interests, including land. The outcome of this present policy debate remains to be&#13;
seen over the coming year, but it appears that the national law on registration, if finally adopted,&#13;
will create pressure for a unified local registry independent of the City Land Committee.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
110&#13;
Land Privatization&#13;
A minimally adequate system for land privatization, consisting of an auction and tender&#13;
regulation and assignment of land privatization responsibilities to a designated agency of the city&#13;
government, was provided by the city as a condition of loan effectiveness. The city's land&#13;
auction regulation was described in my report to Mrs. Nassau, attached. The city's efforts in land&#13;
privatization were partially reflected in the recent land auctions successfully conducted under the&#13;
housing project.&#13;
. Generally, the city should be considered in compliance with the requirements of the&#13;
RAP. Land privatization is proceeding, though with some problems. The requirements of the St.&#13;
Petersburg RAP in the sphere of land privatization and the city's progress since loan&#13;
effectiveness are as follows:&#13;
Objective: Create a fair and open procedure for transferring land from public to private&#13;
ownership and support development of the private land and housing markets.&#13;
Task 1: Allocate authority for the land disposition program to an appropriate city&#13;
agency.&#13;
The city's initial approach to land privatization was through the Investment Tender&#13;
Commission ("ITC"), a city commission responsible for identifying and offering land parcels for&#13;
development, either through competitive procedures or negotiated transactions. The ITC was&#13;
initially staffed by the City Construction Department, but has recently been removed to a newly&#13;
created City Department of Construction and Investment. It remains to be seen whether the&#13;
reorganization will affect the operations of the ITC.&#13;
Despite creation of the ITC, at this time authority to allocate land in the city remains&#13;
spread over a number of city agencies and actors, including not only the ITC but also the&#13;
Architectural and Urban Development Committee, the Mayor's Office, and the City Property&#13;
Committee. In effect, there is no single authority for land privatization issues, resulting in&#13;
different approach being taken by various city departments.&#13;
There is some indication that the existence of various sources and methods of land&#13;
privatization has to some extent undermined the effectiveness of the ITC. Recent reports show&#13;
that only a very small portion of the land privatization transactions - perhaps less than 5% - are&#13;
through competitive procedures and that the preferred method of allocation remains the&#13;
negotiated transaction. Moreover, the overall rate of privatization through city identification and&#13;
offering of land plots to the private developers remains questionable, but whether that is due to&#13;
the market or to the procured or privatization requires further consideration. Staff of the ITC&#13;
complained that the power of the Chief Architect and Mayor's office to allocate land for targeted&#13;
purposes through decree frequently undermined the efforts of the ITC to market land through&#13;
competitive procedures.&#13;
Task 2: Develop a city land allocation policy.&#13;
The city has not yet formulated a comprehensive policy statement for land privatization,&#13;
though it has developed several ongoing programs of privatization which are noteworthy.&#13;
Primary among these is the program of enterprise land privatization which is being carried out&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
111&#13;
under the direction of the City Property Committee, and which is uniquely successful among&#13;
Russian municipalities. Under that program, authorized under the President's post 1994-95&#13;
national program of privatization, hundreds of land parcels are in the process of being conveyed&#13;
to ownership of enterprise, a process which is hoped will ultimately result in a increased&#13;
availability of land in the city for other development purposes as the enterprises further convey&#13;
the land in secondary market transactions.&#13;
In 1995 the Mayor promulgated an order relating to the creation of area development&#13;
companies ("agencies of territorial development") which would have the responsibility to&#13;
develop whole areas of the city, but it is apparent from my recent research that this concept has&#13;
been largely on paper and few of the designated territorial agencies have any real powers or&#13;
responsibilities with respect to city owned land.&#13;
Aside from these examples, the city has not yet enunciated a broad vision of land&#13;
privatization, though some additional legislation is under development or consideration at his&#13;
time, as discussed further below.&#13;
Task 3: Prepare and adopt regulations governing disposition of land through auctions,&#13;
investment tenders and purpose oriented allocations.&#13;
The city adopted its current regulations on land auctions and investment tender&#13;
competitions prior to loan effectiveness. Since then there has been no significant additional&#13;
legislation enacted on this topic. At this time there is some dissatisfaction with the substantive&#13;
rules and procedures of land privatization and the city has under consideration a second&#13;
generation of laws to address the issues, which are based largely on experience and lessons&#13;
learned over the past several years. Legislation dealing with land privatization which is under&#13;
consideration, either conceptually or in a more advanced stage of development, include the&#13;
following:&#13;
*  Draft law of St. Petersburg On Private Investment in Real Estate&#13;
*  Regulation on Creation, Coordination, Implementation and Consolidation of the&#13;
"Address Program" for Capital Investment and Reconstruction&#13;
*  Regulation on the Procedure for Creation, Coordination and Implementation of&#13;
the Address program Fund for Capital Construction and Reconstruction&#13;
*  Regulation On Procedure of Creating, Coordinating and Implementing the&#13;
Address Program for Construction Objects at the Expense of the Federal Budget&#13;
*  Regulation On Preparation and Realization of Investment Projects in the Sphere&#13;
of Real Estate&#13;
*  Regulation On the Procedure Of Offering Real Estate Objects for Construction&#13;
Through Investment Tenders&#13;
All of this proposed legislation is described in more detail in Appendix B.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
112&#13;
Task 4: Develop basic conditions and legalforms for land disposition contracts.&#13;
The city developed its basic forms for conveying land parcels through auction, tender&#13;
and targeted allocation prior to loan effectiveness. However, there are significant complaints&#13;
from the private development community that the current legal documentation fails to provide&#13;
the protections needed for private investment. In fact, my assessment is that this complaint is&#13;
well grounded. There is some opinion that the inadequacies of the legal documentation is at the&#13;
root of the lack of interest in many city offerings of land and real estate for auction or tender.&#13;
The problem is particularly acute in cases where redevelopment requires the developer to invest&#13;
large sums in relocation of present tenants.&#13;
The city has expressed interest in reviewing the current documentation and making&#13;
necessary changes, but that proces has not begun formally.&#13;
Housing Reform&#13;
Housing reform, along with reform of land use and development controls, is under the&#13;
RAP one of the policy sectors to be addressed by the city over the long term. At his time the city&#13;
appears to have made an adequate start and should be considered to be in compliance with the&#13;
RAP. The requirements of the St. Petersburg RAP in the sphere of housing reform and the city's&#13;
progress to date are as follows:&#13;
Objective: Create a local housing policy that (f) encourages and supports private housing&#13;
ownership; (2) encourages and supports transition to private management and maintenance of&#13;
allforms of housing; and (3) provides opportunities for training and assistance to those engaged&#13;
in housing privatization, including public officials, associations of owners, private sector&#13;
housing developers and mortgage lenders.&#13;
Task 1:  Allocate responsibility for housing reform  issues to appropriate city&#13;
departments.&#13;
Responsibility for coordinating the housing reform effort in the city was placed with the&#13;
City Committee On Management of the Municipal Economy, in which are found the&#13;
Departments of Housing and Communal Services. It is not clear at this time whether the recent&#13;
election will result in a reallocation of responsibilities, though there is some indication at this&#13;
time that the Housing Department may be recreated as a separate City Committee.&#13;
Task 2. Create a city working group on housing issues.&#13;
Mayor's Order On Establishing the Coordinating Commission on Development of New&#13;
Forms of Housing Management and Maintenance in St. Petersburg (No. 347-p, 04.10.95)&#13;
created a coordinating committee to oversee the effort to encourage creation of associations of&#13;
homeowners and privatization of building management and maintenance. It is not clear what the&#13;
future of this coordinating committee will be after the recent election.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
113&#13;
Task 3: Development of documents establishing the city housing reform program.&#13;
In June, 1996, the city adopted the local program "Zhelistschye," which follows the&#13;
federal program of the same name. The program is a general, comprehensive policy statement&#13;
on housing reform in the city which identifies both short and long term objectives as well as a&#13;
program of local legislative and regulatory reform in the housing sector.&#13;
Task 4: To the extent required, adopt local laws or regulations on implementation of&#13;
housing reform, including condominiums and private management.&#13;
In the past year the city has enacted a great deal of significant legislation dealing with&#13;
housing reform, including:&#13;
*  Mayor's Order On Establishing the Coordinating Commission on Development&#13;
of New Forms of Housing Management and Maintenance in St. Petersburg (No.&#13;
347-p, 04.10.95)&#13;
*  Mayor's Order On Representatives of the City of St. Petersburg in Home&#13;
Owners Associations (No. 1071 -p, 05.10.95)&#13;
*  Mayor's Order On Approving the Regulation of the Coordinating Commission&#13;
on Development of New Forms of Housing Management and Maintenance (No.&#13;
1251, 01.12.95)&#13;
*  City Property Committee Instruction On City Representation in Home Owners&#13;
Associations (No. 721-p, 29.12.95)&#13;
*  Mayor's Order On Creating Home Owners Associations in St. Petersburg (No.&#13;
55-p, 25.01.96)&#13;
*  Program  of the City Committee for Municipal Services For Creation of&#13;
Associations of Home Owners in St. Petersburg (05.03.96)&#13;
*  Mayor's Order On Payment of Housing and Communal Services Charges in&#13;
Buildings Belonging to Home Owners Associations (No. 296-p, 04.04.96)&#13;
*  Mayor's Order On Approval of Transfer of Housing Management to Home&#13;
Owners Associations (No. 219-p, 18.04.96)&#13;
Task 5: Design and implementation of a program for training housing associations and&#13;
formation of condominiums and otherforms of commonly owned housing.&#13;
The city has begun a program of creating condominium associations pursuant to an&#13;
Order of the Chairman of the Committee On Municipal Economy (the present Governor) dated&#13;
March 3, 1996. Associations are to be created in approximately 100 buildings which have been&#13;
designated in the order. The program is proceeding with technical assistance from the local&#13;
office of the Russian Privatization Committee, and to date associations have been setup in&#13;
approximately 40 buildings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
114&#13;
Also with the assistance of the Russian Privatization Committee, the city has begun a&#13;
training program for officers and directors of condominium associations. The first class of&#13;
approximately thirty persons began in April, 1996, to be followed with training for&#13;
approximately 150 persons.&#13;
Task 6. Design and implementation of training programs in private housing&#13;
management for municipal officials and private sector firms, including demonstration&#13;
programs.&#13;
The city has established a working group under the direction of the Housing Department&#13;
to conduct pilot experiments in private management and maintenance of social housing pursuant&#13;
to the Mayor's Orders On Establishing the Coordinating Commission on Development of New&#13;
Forms of Housing Management and Maintenance in St. Petersburg (No. 347-p, 04.10.95) and&#13;
On Approving the Regulation of the Coordinating Commission on Development of New Forms of&#13;
Housing Management and Maintenance (No. 1251, 01.12.95). The city is receiving technical&#13;
assistance from The Urban Institute to hold its first public tender competitions for housing&#13;
management, which is now expected to occur in September, 1996. The number of housing units&#13;
which will be offered for private management and maintenance competitions will be quite small&#13;
at this time. In this regard, St. Petersburg is significantly behind some other cities - most&#13;
particularly Moscow, which has a substantial program of management privatization - in&#13;
experimenting with private management and maintenance.&#13;
In addition, in Mayor's Order On Approval of Transfer of Housing Management to&#13;
Home Owners Associations (No. 219-p, 18.04.96) the city has adopted the necessary local&#13;
regulations to begin to transfer housing management and maintenance responsibilities over to&#13;
associations of home owners, and is actively in the process of working out the terms and&#13;
procedures for transfer.&#13;
Task 7. Demonstration and implementation of a mortgage lending program for&#13;
individual housing&#13;
The city included this task in its Regulatory Action Program with the intention of&#13;
encouraging development of a private sector market for individual mortgage loans. At this time&#13;
several local banks, including Promstroibank, Baltishsky Bank, St. Petersburg Ipotekabank and&#13;
Bank St. Petersburg, are actively working with The Urban Institute and others to develop retail&#13;
mortgage lending programs. In addition, the city administration is developing a program of&#13;
direct subsidy assistance to persons on the housing waiting list to purchase private housing,&#13;
focusing primarily on downpayment assistance to be used in conjunction with private mortgage&#13;
loans. The program - identified as a priority in the local program "Zhelistschye" - is presently&#13;
in the early stages of development with technical assistance from The Urban Institute.&#13;
Task 8: Demonstration of an insurance programfor emergency housing maintenance.&#13;
The city included this in its Regulatory Action program with the intention of creating the&#13;
basis to encourage the use of private hazard insurance to protect privately owned housing. The&#13;
concept is still under development at this time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
115&#13;
Land Use and Development Controls&#13;
Reform of and use and development controls is the second policy sector identified in he&#13;
RAP in which the city is committed to make progress over the longer term. Like housing&#13;
reform, this is a complex area of reform which involves many city actors and long-entrenched&#13;
methods. At this time it is possible to say that there is a great deal of ferment regarding these&#13;
issues and an openness to reform, but that the process will probably be slow and deliberate.&#13;
However, the complexity of these issues was anticipated in the position of the RAP, which&#13;
allowed for progress over the entire course of the housing project loan. Most of these issues,&#13;
while begun in good faith by the city, will require increased attention over future project years.&#13;
In the sphere of land use and development controls the RAP called on the city to&#13;
consider the following:&#13;
Objective: Create a fair, flexible, open and efficient system of land use regulation responsive to&#13;
the needs ofprivate sector and housing markets.&#13;
Task 1: Prepare acceptable town planning assignments for the land auction project&#13;
component.&#13;
This task was completed prior to the recently completed land auctions.&#13;
Task 2: Revise the city's architectural and planning rules to accommodate the needs of&#13;
private sector development.&#13;
The procedures of obtaining land use and development permits and approvals remains&#13;
the same today as approximately five years ago. However, there is a great deal of activity in this&#13;
sphere that may eventually result in some advances being made.&#13;
Task 3. Consider enactment of a city zoning law.&#13;
City zoning is much under discussion in the city today and the city must be viewed as&#13;
being in compliance with this task. Proposed zoning laws have been created by different&#13;
sources, including the Committee On Architecture and Urban Development, the Fund for&#13;
Development of the St. Petersburg Real Estate Market and the Urban Development Committee&#13;
of the Local Legislative Council. Technical assistance has been provided on various aspects of&#13;
municipal zoning and land use controls by USAID through The Urban Institute and the Bancroft&#13;
Group. The work of the latter consultant was considered in the context of the World Bank&#13;
project on center city rehabilitation, while the urban Institute's work has been connected with&#13;
development of fundamental legislation. It is possible that a zoning law might be enacted by the&#13;
city council in 1997.&#13;
Task 4: Consider enactment of the city law On Urban Planning Regulation.&#13;
The law On Urban Development (Planning) has been prepared and is under&#13;
consideration by the city legislature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
116&#13;
Task 5: Consider enactment of the local land code.&#13;
A local land code has been prepared by the Fund for Development of the St. Petersburg&#13;
Real Estate Market and is under the consideration of the City Real Estate Commission.&#13;
Task 6: Review related regulations concerning land use.&#13;
The city is considering initiatives in various spheres which are related to land use and&#13;
development controls, some of which have been identified in the local program "Zhelitshchye"&#13;
as well as the proposed legislative program for the center city rehabilitation project. Legislative&#13;
and regulatory initiatives related to land use and development controls include the following:&#13;
*  Regulation On the Procedure for Carrying Out City Orders for Construction&#13;
and Reconstruction&#13;
*  Regulation On the Procedure of Obtaining Technical Conditions for&#13;
Connecting to Communal Facilities and Resolving Disputed Issues&#13;
*  Elaboration of the List of Project Planning Norms in St. Petersburg, With&#13;
Generally Applicable Standards for Calculating Technological and&#13;
Economic Requirements&#13;
*  Regulation On the Procedure for Elaborating and Modifying the General&#13;
Plan of Engineering Infrastructure&#13;
Task 7. Review and revise the city master plan to the extent necessary.&#13;
The city, in particular the Committee On Architecture and Urban Development, has&#13;
proposed comprehensive review and revision of the obsolete city master plan. There is a general&#13;
consensus that such a revision is required, particularly in the context of increasing land&#13;
privatization, but the process is costly and the city presently lacks the resources to begin.&#13;
Revision of the master plan has not been the focus of bi-lateral technical assistance programs,&#13;
though as part of the World Bank loan project on center city rehabilitation the city will explore&#13;
the concept of strategic planning for the center city, which will perhaps become a first step in the&#13;
process of revising the city master plan.&#13;
Issues For Future Attention&#13;
The following are in my view the main issues during the second project year:&#13;
Registration of Rights:&#13;
* Rapid adaptation to the national registration law, if enacted, in particular creation of the&#13;
unified local registry for all types of real estate and transactions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
117&#13;
Privatization:&#13;
*  Attempts to increase the rate of privatization through public offerings of city owned land;&#13;
further investigation of the current slow rate of privatization through public offerings.&#13;
*  Further development of a comprehensive city policy on land privatization, taking into&#13;
account the enterprise land privatization program; the agencies of territorial development;&#13;
privatization of condominium land as called for under the recently enacted condominium&#13;
law.&#13;
*  Resolution of issues of authority surrounding land privatization; coordination of privatization&#13;
practices among various city bureaucracies.&#13;
*  Further progress on developing legal rights and documentation which will encourage private&#13;
investment.&#13;
Housing Reform:&#13;
* Accelerating the pace of converting to private management and maintenance of social&#13;
housing.&#13;
Land Use and Development Controls:&#13;
- Development and issuance of transparent regulations on land use and development controls,&#13;
including some form of local zoning code.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
City Planning Issues&#13;
Saint Petersbur, Center City Upgrading Project&#13;
Main issues&#13;
1.           The upgrading of St. Petersburg city center raises a number of issues which should&#13;
be discussed and clarified before the implementation of any large scale project. These issues are:&#13;
a)    objectives in upgrading the city center&#13;
b)    clarification of current occupants rights&#13;
c)    the role of Govemment in the upgrading of the city center&#13;
d)    the need for the deveioprment of ai uDgTading st-,ategy li.l..g !and a  e&#13;
reguiaLions, ioca; guvei-nment spatial development objectives and the development&#13;
of the city infrastructure;&#13;
e)    Realistic expectations on the pace of upgrading under current conditions;&#13;
fl    the need for data collection and dissemination&#13;
The objectives&#13;
2.           The main objectives in upgrading the city center should be:&#13;
a)    to preserve the image of St. Petersburg as a unique historical city with a rich&#13;
cultural past;&#13;
b)    to promote the type of economic activities which are compatible with the&#13;
preservation of the historical building stock;&#13;
c)    to allow the property market to function with maximum efficiency within the limits&#13;
imposed by the preservation of the building stock;&#13;
3.           The rapid improvement of the quality of the housing stock is not a main objective&#13;
of the upgrading. Preservation of residential historical buildings is very expensive. It is too costly&#13;
to be subsidized on a large scale by the public sector. Because apartments located in upgraded&#13;
historical buildings will cost much more than apartments in equivalent modem buildings it is not&#13;
realistic to pursue a direct social housing objective within the upgrading program. Hiowver -.this&#13;
does not mean that the rights of low income households who are presently occupying apartments&#13;
located in historical buildings have to be abridged. see below "Clarification of occupants rights"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
120&#13;
Clarification of Current Occupants' Rights&#13;
4.    Allowing current occupants to collect their share of the market price of the apartnent they&#13;
occupy might be an eficient way of redistributing the wealth generated by real estate market&#13;
forces. If, in an effort to decrease the cost of relocition, a policy was adopted to provide&#13;
occupants with an apartment "equivalent" in size but not in market value, this would result in a&#13;
regressive transfer of wealth from poor to rich. The preservation of the right of the occupants -&#13;
not simply the right to housing but the right to a share of the market value of their apartment-&#13;
should be one of the major concern of the government. If the preservation of this right contnbutes&#13;
to slow down the upgrading process, so be it! The social cost of dispossessing the current&#13;
occupants from a large part of the value of their real estate assets and transferring it to wealthier&#13;
households would be much higher than the few additional years that might be required for&#13;
upgradina if the full right of occupant is respected.&#13;
The role of Government&#13;
5.            The traditional role of Govemment in a market economy is to provide and&#13;
maintain city infrastructure and to establish the rules under which the market will function.&#13;
Because of its role as a regulator, the government could not become a supplier of the commodity&#13;
it regulates without having a conflict of interest. Exceptionally,*and only when a large government&#13;
investment in infrastructure justifies it, the government could justify entering into financial&#13;
partnership wicn private reai estate developers in order to recover more directly its investment.&#13;
This might be the case for instance in urban development around railways or metro stations.&#13;
6.            In the case of the upgradinc project of St. Petersburg, the government should&#13;
concentrate its effort on the following tasks:&#13;
a)     upgrading infrastructure in the historical area to a level consistent with the&#13;
projected land use and population and employment density;&#13;
b)     keeping a detailed inventory of the buildings or part of buildings with historical or&#13;
art,istic value which should be preserved, including an assessment of the urgency of&#13;
repairs&#13;
c)     preparing a strategy for upgrading the historical districts. This strategy would&#13;
provide a framework for government investment in infrastructure and for special&#13;
regulations affiecting the area.&#13;
d)     establishing the rules un der which the upgrading will function.&#13;
7.     Some part of the infrastructure network in the city center is often dating back from pre-&#13;
Revolutionary times . Temporary repairs of the inifrastructure network are regularly being&#13;
conducted on an emergency basis. The proposed project should provide the resources to build in&#13;
the center of Saint Petersburg an infrastructure as efficient as its superstructure is prestigious.&#13;
However, emergency measures having been taken, many of the investments would have to be&#13;
considered in the context of the entire city. The regulatory part is as important as the&#13;
infrastructure and should mobilize government resource and attention.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
121&#13;
8.           Should the local government build a "demonstration project"? Given the present&#13;
slow pace of upgrading the local government might be tempted to stimulate the process by&#13;
participating directly-in the selection, financing and construction of a demonstration.project. The&#13;
objective being to show private developers that it is feasible to upgrade a building quickly and&#13;
profitably. The temptation to conduct this type of demonstration should be strongly resisted for&#13;
two reasons: (a) projects conducted by the govemment to demonstrate the flexibility and&#13;
efficiency of its own bureaucracy is never very convincing to the private sector, and (b) the&#13;
financing and costs parameters used by the government are not equivalent to those met in the&#13;
private sector. For instance the time spent by government employees in the design and&#13;
administration of a project is rarely accounted for at its full cost. Interest paid during construction&#13;
by government --if accounted for at all-- is rarely at the same interest rate as the one which would&#13;
be paid by the private sector. So what may appear profitable to government may be a loss making&#13;
venture for the private sector.&#13;
Development of an upgrading strategy&#13;
9.    It is important that the upgrading measures --investments in infrastructure and regulations-&#13;
- be consistent with an overall upgrading strategy which takes into account the spatial land use&#13;
issues confronting the city. The development of this strategy will also allow the staff of the&#13;
government urban planning department to redirect their skill and energy toward regulatory&#13;
activities based on solid analytical work and away from the design of detailed urban design.&#13;
schemes which should be left to the private sector.&#13;
10.   As part of the strategy, the city should prepare an upgrading scenario where middle term&#13;
(5 years) altemative transformations in land use and population densities are projected. This&#13;
strategy is not a plan nor a blue print, it is more a series of positions that the Municipal&#13;
government is taking on a number of issues taking into account the full implications of these&#13;
decisions and insuring that the various positions taken are fully consistent with the objectives. A&#13;
preliminary list of issues related to the upgrading ofthe.historical city are discussed below.&#13;
11.   Methodologv. The development of the upgrading strategy will be done in three stages:&#13;
first, a list of issues with a short discussion of the possible alternative ways of resolving them;&#13;
second, collection and anslysis of data which would be relevant to the issues; third, city officials&#13;
in consultation with private sector representatives take decisions on each issue; the expected&#13;
spatial outcome of the decisions taken should be sumrnarized in a land use model and a schematic&#13;
land use map which would represent the likely distribution of population, land use and&#13;
employment in the central district after a period of about 5 years. This projection is a concrete&#13;
reflection of the spatial outcome of the policy decisions taken. The land use projection is not an&#13;
approved plan nor a legal document, it is more a management tool, and can be amended any time&#13;
to reflect new circumstances. It is an anticipation of the private sector investments triggered by&#13;
the new regulatory framework and by government infrastructure investment decisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
122&#13;
12.   To be usefil and operational, the preparation of a strategy document should not take more&#13;
than 3 months. It should be done mostly with the expertise available locally, using data already&#13;
available. In my opinion, once the scope and tasks of the strategy document are defined, a&#13;
number of local consulting firms could conduct all the work required, including the spatial analysis&#13;
and monitoring using GIS technology.&#13;
13.   The strategy guides the location of public and private investment alike. After the strategy&#13;
has been defined, the Physical Planning Department or a consulting firm contracted by the city&#13;
will conduct a careful spatial monitoring of the physical changes occurring in the central districts,&#13;
feeding back into the model the updated information. For instance it will be essential to monitor&#13;
the location, sale or lease price and usage of renovated historical buildings. The pace at which&#13;
communal apartments are consolidated into single apartments should also be monitored. This&#13;
monitoring is used to update the projection on a continual basis and eventually raise new issues or&#13;
change strategy on old issues.&#13;
14.   In order to help explain in less abstract terms what parameters could be essential in the&#13;
development of such a strategy, I have prepared (Annex 1) a simplified land use map of the&#13;
Admiralty and Central districts and a corresponding land use table representing the current&#13;
situation (using the data made available to the mission) and a 5 years projection based on a&#13;
number of policy decision provided for illustrative purpose. The methodology for preparing the&#13;
strategy is presented in Annex I together with summary terms of reference for such a study.&#13;
15.   Land use and regulatorv issues which should be Dart of the upgradin . Some of the most&#13;
important land use and regulatory issues which would have to be addressed by the upgrading&#13;
strategy are:&#13;
a)    Should the transformation from residential to commercial land use be limited by&#13;
renulation?.&#13;
The current pressure on the historical building stock tend to transform floor space&#13;
currently used for housing into commercial or office space. Indeed, it seems that in&#13;
many cases, upgrading is financially feasible only if such land use change is allowed&#13;
to occurs. The elimination of many down-town apartments has already happened&#13;
on a large scale in many cities of Eastem Europe (Warsaw, Budapest, Prague), and&#13;
are a constant concern in many Westem European cities (Paris, Lyon, Bologna).&#13;
Many urban planners do not consider it desirable that a city center be entirely&#13;
devoted to business activities and be empty of habitations. In former planned&#13;
economy the transformation of some of the residential space into commercial space&#13;
is necessary given the little floor space available for the service sector. Regulating&#13;
strictly this transforrnation could strongly hinder the development-of the economy&#13;
of the city and therefore should not be considered lightly.&#13;
I strongly recommend that St. Petersburg Urban Planning office monitors the pace&#13;
and the location at which this transformation occur before taking any regulatory&#13;
measures. In the case of St. Petersburg, the topography creates such large&#13;
accessibility differences within the 4 central districts that, relying entirely on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
123&#13;
market forces, a balance between commercial and residential space could be&#13;
reached "naturally" without relying on regulations. The consequences of land use&#13;
changes triggered by market forces is an issue which will have to be -addressed by&#13;
the upgrading strategy.&#13;
b)    Spatial issues raised bv the relocation of households currentlv living in historical&#13;
structures.&#13;
All cities which have developed under a centrally planned economy tend to have an&#13;
inefficient density gradient and a widely dispersed population compared to cities&#13;
developed under a market economy '. The upgrading of historical structures and&#13;
the replacement of current households by either conmnercial and office space or&#13;
higher income households occupying more space per family will tend to lower the&#13;
density of the central districts and further aggravate the dispersed pattern of St.&#13;
Petersburg. This could results not only in longer commuting costs and a higher&#13;
energy consumption for transport but also in a social segregation of low income&#13;
population in distant suburbs. This relocation is presently occurring at a lirmited&#13;
scale, as new apartments are mostly built in the periphery. It is not inevitable that&#13;
this situation continue. St. Petersburg possesses vast reserves of highly accessible&#13;
underutilized industrial land which could be redeveloped to increase the supply of&#13;
middle and low income housing. The upgrading strategy will have to look into the&#13;
issue of dispersion and propose altemative to relocation in the periphery.&#13;
c)    Recycling of industrial land close to the historical district&#13;
According to a prelirminary mission estimates the Addmiralty and Central Districts&#13;
alone (see annex 1) contains more than 5 square kilometers of industrial land or&#13;
about 20% of the total district area and about 45% of all the salable area in the&#13;
district (salable area consists of all land not used for streets, canals, parks, utilities&#13;
and government ). However, extrapolating from employment survey and land use&#13;
maps it appears that more than 100,000 industrial jobs are still located within the&#13;
two districts. Within the framework of the strategy the municipal authorities will&#13;
have to address the issue of industry and job relocation.&#13;
d)    Land use standards to be used in non historical areas and in reconverted industrial&#13;
areas&#13;
The high cost of construction in upgraded areas and the high market value of the&#13;
most prestigious areas will attract a high income population into the central&#13;
districts. At the same time, low income households presently living in historical&#13;
buildings will have to be displaced. To compensate for this loss, it is important that&#13;
a large part of the housing stock of the central districts be affordable to middle and&#13;
low income households. The upgrading strategy should therefore recommend land&#13;
use standards which are compatible with the development of low income housing&#13;
in areas which are not part of the historical areas but are located in the central&#13;
see 'Cities Without Land Markets" World Bank Discussion paper # 227 by Alain Bertaud &amp; Bertrand Renaud&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
124&#13;
districts, in particular in areas where industrial land can be recycled into residential&#13;
use. This will require keeping the same type of land use intensity than the one used&#13;
in thel,istorical part of town and not controlling the population density but let&#13;
affordability determine apartment sizes and standards. The Tolstowsky Dom, built&#13;
in 1905 by Fiodor Lidval on Fantanka canal is a good example of high intensity use&#13;
of land made culturally acceptable by imaginative design. The new land use and&#13;
zoning regulations which are being prepared for the center of the city should be&#13;
able to pass the following test: would they allow a modern replica of the&#13;
Tolstowsky Dom to be built? Land use regulations which will be compatible with&#13;
affordable housing for low -middle income households will also contnbute to the&#13;
spatial restructuration of St. Petersburg by increasing the density in the central&#13;
areas and decreasing the population dispersion.&#13;
e)    Transport&#13;
Many historical central districts have passed by several phases in their&#13;
dealing with transport. The first phase consists in frantically trying to adapt a city&#13;
center designed for carriages to accommodate individual car. During that phase,&#13;
new highways are built on or under river embankments and no building permits are&#13;
given without adequate facilities for off-street parking. In the second stage of&#13;
development, many cities realize that by trying to catch up with the automobile&#13;
they reach a point where they destroy the city itself and its public transport system.&#13;
At that phase, the provision of private parking space is discouraged. In developing&#13;
its upgrading strategy the city will have to decide what mode split of transport it&#13;
wants to keep and whether it is compatible with the economic activities which will&#13;
take place in the center. The decision to keep or decrease the 100, 000 industrial&#13;
jobs still provided in the central districts will be closely related to this traffic&#13;
option. The land use projection derived from the strategy will be the framework&#13;
under which transport planner could develop their own sectoral investment&#13;
program.&#13;
f)    Infrastructure and social services supply in renovated areas&#13;
The development of the upgrading strategy will provides an images of population&#13;
distribution and jobs in the central districts quite different from the present&#13;
situation. This will change the profile of demand. It will probably require an&#13;
adjustment of infrastructure and social service provision. The strategy will provide&#13;
the demographic figures on jobs and population spatial distribution for the different&#13;
sector agencies to develop their own program in support of the strategy.&#13;
g)    PhasinQ of upgrading and relocation&#13;
Finally, a realistic approach to upgrading will probably lead to the conclusion that&#13;
it is a long range process. When the city would have put in place all the regulatory&#13;
and fiscal instrument and the necessary infrastructure it will still not completely&#13;
dominate the renovation process which will depend on many exogenous factors. It&#13;
is therefore necessary that the phasing of the renovation of the entire stock be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
125&#13;
realistically done. This phasing will have a number of policy implications. If the&#13;
formal renovation of the entire stock takes, say, 10 years, what should be the&#13;
policy toward apartments which are in very bad conditions but are unlikely to be&#13;
renovated in the near future? would the city have a budget for emergency repairs&#13;
of roofs and structure? would tenants be provided with incentive to repair their&#13;
own houses? Would occupiers of historical apartments have an incentive to see&#13;
their dwellings decay faster than would naturally occur in order to jump the queue&#13;
for renovation?&#13;
Projecting the pace of renovation: how many upgraded historical buildings are&#13;
likely to clear the market under current conditions?&#13;
16.          No matter how elaborate is the legislation concerning upgrading, the pace of&#13;
renovation will be dictated by market forces. At present, using the limited information available&#13;
on upgrading cost and market prices, it seems that only a small fraction of the stock would have a&#13;
post-upgrading market price higher than the cost of renovation. The streamlining of administrative&#13;
and regulatory procedure, the clarification of property rights, the improvement of building&#13;
technology, the wider availability of credit could increase the number of structures for which&#13;
renovation is economically feasible. However, for the majority of historical structures a complete&#13;
renovation is far in the future.&#13;
17.    At present the total number of apartments in the Central and Admiralty district is&#13;
estimated at around 150,000 units. The cost of the construction work for the renovation of a&#13;
listed historical buildine2 range from USS 500 to 1500 per m2. The average cost of relocation is&#13;
around S 800 per m2. In addition most developer have to pay back the city or the owners in kind&#13;
for the purchase of the structure representing about 20% of the renovated apartments. So the&#13;
average total cost of renovation (civil work, relocation and overheads) is around $1,800 per m2,&#13;
this would require a market sale price of at least $2,000 per m2. While some buildings in specific&#13;
location can fetch even a higher price, most locations and building quality are unlikely to justify&#13;
such a price when a new apartment in the periphery cost about $500 per square meter and an&#13;
unrenovated apartment in a central district but with undesirable location sell for $300 per m2. The&#13;
same exercise could be conducted for unlisted but protected buildings -buildings that are not&#13;
historical themselves but are located in a protected block where a number of constraints on&#13;
building bulk and materials do exist, thus increasing renovation costs.&#13;
18.          It would be important to complement the upgrading strategy with an evaluation of&#13;
the distribution of the current market prices of the entire housing stock of the central districts.&#13;
Graph I has been prepared for the Admiralty and Central districts to illustrate the methodology&#13;
proposed and how such an evaluation could be used to take strategic decisions. It is&#13;
recommended to develop one similar graph for each historical district. The figures used on the&#13;
graph are purely illustrative, but a rapid sample survey conducted on stratified samples and with&#13;
the help of a land use map could permit to conduct such an analysis very rapidly.&#13;
2 Historical building are on one of three lists :National, local or temporary list. The constraints on renovation are&#13;
the same for building on any of the list.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
126&#13;
19.          On the horizontal axis of the graph are the market prices of renovated buildings&#13;
based on the distribution of the stock by location and building attractiveness. For instance the&#13;
highest price is reached by structure along the main canals, Nevsky Prospect and in general in the&#13;
eastern part of the Admiralty district. The lowest prices correspond to apartments located close to&#13;
the western industrial zone.&#13;
20.          The building stock is divided into 3 categories related to the cost of renovation. In&#13;
the first category are the listed historical buildings where the renovation work entails a large&#13;
amount of craftsmanship to keep up with the character of the building. In the second category are&#13;
buildina located in protected historical areas but which are not historical themselves. These&#13;
building are submitted to special regulatory constraints concerning building materials and exterior&#13;
shape and design but do not require costly finishing craftsmanship. The last category includes&#13;
buildings which are free of constraints except those from the current building code and the new&#13;
zoning regulations which are being prepared by government agencies. To each category of&#13;
building corresponds an average cost of renovation -- represented by vertical bars on the graph -&#13;
based on the regulatory constraints imposed by their historical character and a cost for relocating&#13;
present occupants. The buildings whose market price are higher than the cost line of their&#13;
category (to the right of the vertical line) clear the market, the other(to the left of the line) do&#13;
not. One can see on graph I that under current assumptions not even 5% of the stock is likely to&#13;
be renovated without subsidies.&#13;
21.          The graph can be used to take strategic decisions because the distribution of the&#13;
market price of buildings and the cost of renovating them will change over time. The objective is&#13;
of course to combine measures which would push as many building possible to the right of the&#13;
cost line i.e. increase their value. Several types of actions are possible for doing so. It should be&#13;
possible to increase the market value of part of the stock by ameliorating the infrastructure, the&#13;
maintenance of a neighborhood or removing some nuisance (for instance reconverting some of the&#13;
industrial areas). It should also be possible to move the cost lines toward the left by streamlining&#13;
administrative procedure, reducing investors risks by clarifying property rights, and disserninating&#13;
information.&#13;
Data Dissemination&#13;
22.   Data dissemination is going to be an important part of the strategy. It is essential that all&#13;
the data concerning upgrading, land use, regulations, demography and market prices be&#13;
disseminated as widely as possible. In particular, the addresses of buildings on the 3 historical&#13;
building lists, with location map should be published as soon as possible. Currently the two&#13;
published list, State and local, contains the name of historical "objects" to be protected. The&#13;
amount of floor space which is subject to historical building regulatory constraints should be&#13;
calculated as soon as possible. In addition the City planning office should draw a list (with&#13;
location map, floor space and current occupancy) of the historical buildings which are in the worst&#13;
structural conditions.&#13;

B. Methodology&#13;
13.   The development of an upgrading strategy requires taking decisions on a number of issues.&#13;
Each decisions taken triger a chain reaction of physical and financial consequences which&#13;
are made explicit in the model. These physical consequences are then examined and tested&#13;
for their feasibility and desirability. If the the test is negative, strategic decisions have to be&#13;
iterated until the consequence are both feasible and acceptable&#13;
14.   For instance:&#13;
Example of Strategic Decisions&#13;
a)    50% of the listed historical housing stock will be upgraded in 5 years;&#13;
b)    Displaced tenants will receive a compensation of 1.5 m2 for each m2 vacated;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
140&#13;
c)    no limits will be put on conversion of residential floor space into commercial and it&#13;
is expected that in 5 years the conmmercial space will have raised to 45% from the&#13;
current 35% of total floor space&#13;
15.          Physical consequence&#13;
a)    80,000 people in 25,000 apartments will have to be relocated;&#13;
b)    1,250,000 m2 will be recovered with a potential average market price of $ 900/m2&#13;
c)    1,875,000 m2 of floor space will have to be built&#13;
d)    the decrease or increase in number ofjobs and households in the central districts&#13;
Financial Consequences:&#13;
e)    Public investments&#13;
f)    Private investments&#13;
16.   The Model includes 4 mathematically interrelated parts:&#13;
a)    A digital land use map&#13;
b)    a land use data base directly extracted or extrapolated from the map&#13;
c)    a land use transformation model showing current land use and its transformation&#13;
after 5 years based on strategic decisions and assumptions on market trends;&#13;
d)    an histogram of representing the current market prices' distribution of the housing&#13;
stock;&#13;
&#13;

SOCIAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
ST. PETERSBURG CENTER CITY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
1.     Background&#13;
The City Govermnent of St. Petersburg considers the rehabilitation of its historical area to&#13;
be among its highest priorities. The justifications for this priority include expected high&#13;
economic return to such activity through tourism, increased commercial and service activity,&#13;
preservation of culture, as well as the improvement of the living conditions of the population,&#13;
especially those who live in overcrowded communal accommodations without access to adequate&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
In the past, housing was largely provided by state enterprises, the military and by the&#13;
municipality free of direct charges. Owing to a chronic shortage of housing, large segments of&#13;
the population, especially those living in the inner city, were allocated to communal apartments&#13;
in which often unrelated people shared rooms. Ironically, the center city had a much larger&#13;
concentration of communal apartments; after the revolution the properties of the wealth families,&#13;
which were located in the best parts of the center city, were taken over and divided among many&#13;
families. As a result, building and apartments which would have been particularly attractive for&#13;
the private sector development are often more complicated to acquire for redevelopment. The&#13;
families who share these flats, on the other hand, suffer from lack of privacy, overcrowding, poor&#13;
access to sanitation infrastructure and extremely poor maintenance of the exterior and interior of&#13;
their residence.&#13;
Citizens who were in communal, transitional or temporary housing, those who wanted to&#13;
get married and establish a family, those who were in unsafe homes, and those who were&#13;
allocated space well below the legally accepted standard of about 10 sq.m. per person were&#13;
entitled to a new allocation. There existed a long list of residents waiting for re-allocation of&#13;
somewhat more adequate housing; this re-allocation was commonly referred as "relocation" and&#13;
the process as "resettlement."' As is the case today, there was high demand among those in the&#13;
I      It is essential not to confuse this terminology with the involuntary resettlement resulting from development&#13;
projects. In St. Petersburg, except for the occupants of buildings certified unsafe for human habitation, both the de&#13;
jure and the de facto situation excludes any possibility of involuntary resettlement. In those cases where a building&#13;
has to be evacuated for safety reasons, the State is under obligation to provide at least three choices before a family&#13;
is resettled.&#13;
The Housing Code of 1982 (Chapter 10) of the Russian Federation defines the basis for eviction and&#13;
restricts it to the following categories: temporary workers temporarily housed in company boarding houses;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
142&#13;
waiting list (the majority of whom were residents of communal apartments) to be relocated;&#13;
indeed, the citizens strongly feel that they are entitled for relocation to private residential space&#13;
having already waited years for one. In the past, it usually took over ten years to get a new&#13;
allocation (or to be "relocated"), "but the system worked". However, the ability of the public&#13;
2&#13;
sector to continue to play the role of the provider of housing has dramatically weakened .&#13;
3&#13;
According to a recent (1994) study , only 2.2 percent of households in St. Petersburg were&#13;
4&#13;
allocated housing through the waiting list mechanism4.&#13;
Currently, some 325,000 families or 850,000 people are in the official waiting list and are&#13;
entitled for relocation. Thus, "relocation" has historically been an entitlement, and acquisition of&#13;
5&#13;
a relocation home meant a long awaited improvement in housing conditions . There has been a&#13;
dramatic reduction in the ability of the public sector to allocate housing to tenants of communal&#13;
housing in the past years. Instead, a relatively rapid process of private transactions are taking&#13;
place in well maintained prestigious buildings whereby residents of communal flats are provided&#13;
with independent flats in exchange for the original flat they share with others. However, there is&#13;
need to expedite this process. This will depend largely in putting the right policies in place and&#13;
workers who loose their jobs because of illegal/criminal behavior and who live in company housing, and those who&#13;
voluntarily quit their jobs with a company but occupy company housing. The only other concrete possibility for&#13;
eviction from municipal, state or enterprise housing is limited to those cases where the family clearly occupies a&#13;
residential space illegally, without being allocated to that space. Even these cases are subject to a court review&#13;
before a decision is made whether or not the State has the responsibility to resettle the concerned families. In&#13;
enterprises which are closed down, even when enterprise housing is not available, the State is under obligation to&#13;
provide housing for the families concerned.&#13;
There are additional by-laws and amendments to the Law of 1982; those which are made in 1989 at the&#13;
State level and the amendments made for St. Petersburg in 1993. There is need to obtain full text of these texts for&#13;
further analyses. Some of these more recent amendments to the Housing Code specifies the condition of eviction of&#13;
a tenant from a privately owned home; however, no such act can be enacted without full review by a court.&#13;
2      The housing reform in Russia, and accordingly in St. Petersburg, began in 1992 with the suspension of&#13;
centralized funding for housing construction and major repairs from the State budget and the privatization of&#13;
municipal flats. The result was that in 1993, the rate of housing construction in St. Petersburg was a tenth of its&#13;
1989 level and refurbishment was transferred to the private sector completely. To ensure refurbishment of their&#13;
privatized homes, many owners have sought to let their space as "office space" with the effect that office space in&#13;
the city was renting for $600 per square meter per annum, more expensive than New York (Baranov 1994).&#13;
3      Commissioned jointly by USAID and the World Bank.&#13;
4      During the past two years, the public sector provision of relocation homes have practically stopped except&#13;
for three homes created specially for the elderly, accommodating about 70 families each.&#13;
5      According to the 1994 USAID/World Bank Study, nearly 10 percent of households in St. Petersburg were&#13;
able to improve their housing situation over the 5 years prior to the survey; of these about a fifth did so through re-&#13;
allocation. However, when the households were asked whether they improved their housing situation in 1993,&#13;
about 5% percent responded affirmatively. Of these, less than one tenth did so through the re-allocation process&#13;
(waiting list).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
143&#13;
providing sufficient incentives for the private sector to have a safe and profitable environment to&#13;
function .&#13;
There is also need to strengthen public programs of housing allocation to tenants of&#13;
unsafe municipal housing7. It appears that the location, zonal and historical characteristics of&#13;
8&#13;
these buildings provide disincentives for private sector development . It also poses a broader&#13;
issue of urban management when severely reduced public resources will further accelerate&#13;
9&#13;
deterioration of the existing housing stock&#13;
2.     Overall Objectives of Social Assessment for the Engineering Loan&#13;
Social assessment is a process which provides an integrated framework for&#13;
incorporating participation and social analysis into the design and delivery of Bank-assisted&#13;
operational and analytical work. In the context of the St.Petersburg Center City Rehabilitation&#13;
Engineering Project, social assessment will consist of establishing the needs and priorities of&#13;
different stakeholders, ensuring that their interests are reflected in the alternative models&#13;
developed for the rehabilitation of the city, and developing mitigation plans for any negative&#13;
social impact that may be implied by any of these models.&#13;
Perhaps the most important issue to be addressed by the social assessment of the St.&#13;
Petersburg Center City Rehabilitation Engineering Project will be the identification of&#13;
mechanisms for citizen participation in the rehabilitation process. Given the current level of&#13;
private sector development and the diminished strength of the public sector as the provider and&#13;
safe keeper of the housing stock, it is evident that citizen's energies has to be released and&#13;
directed towards this goal. There are no easy solutions and one that would be applicable across&#13;
different socio-economic groups cannot be found.&#13;
6      Discussions held with developers point out that the current arrangements for 50/50 sharing of finished&#13;
apartments between the municipality and the developers do not provide sufficient incentive to the private sector to&#13;
rehabilitate many buildings. The uncertainties concerning turn key mechanisms for rehabilitation activities also add&#13;
to these disincentives.&#13;
7       In the Center city alone there are 300 such buildings; of these 28 represent immediate danger and are&#13;
occupied by 890 families. The City has a program that would allow only half of these 28 buildings to be evacuated&#13;
over the next years.&#13;
8      A pre-feasibility of an emergency pilot program (as part of the engineering loan) to accelerate public sector&#13;
assistance to these families is therefore recommended.&#13;
9       Several experts met believe that such deterioration is evident and that the slow pace of development of&#13;
tenant or condo associations contribute to this factor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
144&#13;
Thus, the social assessment will be an ongoing and continuous function, built into the&#13;
project implementation. It will consist of social studies as well as social impact evaluation of&#13;
technical and economic studies undertaken in the context of the project. It will provide a&#13;
participatory process whereby a system of consultation and public hearings will be integrated&#13;
into the project implementation and community participation in alternative rehabilitation models&#13;
will be among major project outputs. Likewise, contributions of different categories of&#13;
stakeholders will be sought for the identification and implementation of pilot projects.&#13;
3.     Procedures for Social Assessment&#13;
The Terms of Reference Outlined here provides:&#13;
* a broad framework for the participatory approach that needs to be adopted;&#13;
* defines the scope for the type of social issues to be investigated; and&#13;
* proposes the following type of surveys focusing primarily on the Center City:&#13;
(a) needs assessment surveys with special modules designed for the particularly&#13;
vulnerable groups;&#13;
(b) affordability and willingness to pay surveys carried out with a representative sample&#13;
of 'resident" groups identified below; and&#13;
(c) housing/residential mobility surveys to understand the social dynamics of urban&#13;
development and to design policies and projects that would help strengthen socially and&#13;
economically desirable processes.&#13;
Needless to say, unless otherwise justified (by the consultants), there is no need to&#13;
undertake several different surveys. Rather, the issues identified under (a)-(c), above, can be&#13;
covered by one research instrument10. Although several relatively recent surveys are available&#13;
(e.g., affordability survey of 1994), their results do not appear to be well analyzed. More&#13;
importantly, the sub-sample they provide for Center City socio-economic trends analyses is&#13;
extremely small and not easy to disaggregate. From qualitative studies and expert interviews11, it&#13;
10     Likewise, unless otherwise shown to be essential by the consultants, city wide surveys are not&#13;
recommended given the limited territorial scope of the Engineering Project. Should information be needed to&#13;
compare Center City trends with trends elsewhere in the city, there is potential to use some of the more recent&#13;
survey information (such as those prepared for the Housing Project). It is also possible to rely on expert knowledge.&#13;
I I    As well as such physical clues as "new windows" which indicate business take over of private residential&#13;
property&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
145&#13;
is clear that a dynamic process of social change is in place in the Center city and thus new and&#13;
comprehensive information will help guide the Proposed Project in a systematic fashion.&#13;
These representative surveys need to be complemented by such social assessment tools as&#13;
"focused group discussions" and "participant observations". Qualified local social scientists are&#13;
available to undertake these work.&#13;
Through these quantitative and qualitative social investigations, a social map of the&#13;
Center city should be developed. This geographical specificity of the social data is important to&#13;
stress in order for the social assessment to provide sufficient guidance for the formulation of the&#13;
follow-up investment projects to the proposed Engineering Loan.'2&#13;
4.     Policy and Pilot Project Focus&#13;
The proposed social assessment also suggests social impact assessment of (a) policies to&#13;
be developed under the project, and (b) the pilot projects to be defined for implementation.&#13;
Social impacts of policies, Laws and regulations regarding:&#13;
(a) private land ownership;&#13;
(b) privatization of rooms in communal apartments;&#13;
(c) tenant and condo associations&#13;
(d) zoning regulations are particularly important and should be undertaken for each of the&#13;
stakeholder groups identified in the following section.&#13;
This earlier phase of the social assessment also makes an attempt to suggest several pilot&#13;
projects for implementation under the engineering loan. These consist of the following (and can&#13;
be further defined for the appraisal of the project):&#13;
(a)    "Bed-and-breakfast" type of tourism development in the Center city to (i) enhance&#13;
household income: (ii) encourage productive use of residential space: (iii) facilitate households'&#13;
ability to pay real estate taxes; (iv) encourage development of tenant or condo associations; and,&#13;
most importantly, (v) mobilize citizen participation in the urban rehabilitation process'3;&#13;
A computerized and geographically specific registration data may be available and can be used as a&#13;
baseline.&#13;
13     There is a small network of families who have already started this type of activity and this network can be&#13;
used to legalize and expand the process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
146&#13;
(b)    Support to the private sector development of condo management institutions and&#13;
carry out a large scale public education program on citizen ownership of urban rehabilitation14;&#13;
ic)    Support the development of commercially viable housing for the care of the&#13;
elderly&#13;
16&#13;
(d)    Support the city administration for an emergency evacuation program&#13;
5.     Specific Objectives of the Social Assessment&#13;
Specifically, the social assessment to be carried out for the Project will be carried out as&#13;
an integral part of the other studies and pilot projects to be prepared under the Project and will:&#13;
(a)    identify key interest groups (stakeholders) and establish an appropriate framework&#13;
for their participation in the project development and implementation;&#13;
(b)    ensure that alternative rehabilitation models developed, pilot projects identified,&#13;
study tours organized" and the incentives for change underlying these are acceptable to the range&#13;
of people intended to benefit, and that interest of key social groups (different categories of&#13;
tenants, the elderly, women, etc.) are reflected in these;&#13;
(c)    assess the social impact of alternative rehabilitation models, policies, regulations,&#13;
etc. developed during project implementation and the pilot programs defined and ensure that&#13;
they have no adverse effects. If such effects are anticipated, develop satisfactory mitigation&#13;
plans to minimize negative impacts; and&#13;
14     Currently, the municipality has a monopoly over maintenance activities and the development of a&#13;
competitive housing management environment would be particularly beneficial to the consumers.&#13;
15     The municipality has recently completed a housing project for the elderly; however, the costs are high and&#13;
there are no plans for even the cost recovery of operations expenses.&#13;
16     A public fund has been established for this purpose; however, the resources are inadequate and an&#13;
implementation plan in not in place.&#13;
"7     Many development projects confine their 'study tour' and 'training' activities to the immediate&#13;
stakeholders: the borrower agency personnel. A participatory projet, on the other hand, should make a broader&#13;
assessment of stakeholder needs for training. An immediate study tour or training component of the project may&#13;
consist of supporting the private sector development for condo management (in support of the pilot projects&#13;
suggested under (c), below).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
147&#13;
(d)   develop capacity within the project implementation framework to enable&#13;
participation, resolve conflicts, permit service delivery, and carry out mitigation as required.&#13;
6.    Mitigation&#13;
Preliminary analysis of the social processes involved clearly indicate differential impact&#13;
of housing policies and project on different stakeholder groups. Anticipated mitigation measures&#13;
consist primarily of policy interventions rather than public sector investments. For instance,&#13;
over the past few years about 100 construction firms have basically assumed full responsibility in&#13;
facilitating the access of residents of communal apartments to private flats; policies that would&#13;
hinder, retard or halt the private sector initiative are thus likely to negatively impact this&#13;
particularly vulnerable group. The solution is in putting the appropriate policies in place.&#13;
Involuntary resettlement or involuntary relocation is unlikely to be an issue during&#13;
the course of the Engineering Loan preparation or implementation. The issue is whether or not&#13;
one or more of the projects prepared under this loan may lead to projects involving involuntary&#13;
resettlement. Because of the need to maintain the historical integrity of the Center city, none of&#13;
the projects that may be prepared with financing from the proposed engineering project is&#13;
expected to cause resettlement. No changes in road infrastructure is envisioned; and other&#13;
possible infrastructure projects will have to consist of rehabilitation of the water and/or the&#13;
heating systems. Should, however, be any projects identified and prepared for possible&#13;
investment under the proposed engineering project involve involuntary resettlement, the social&#13;
assessment team will put the World Bank Operation Directive on Involuntary Resettlement in&#13;
effect and will prepare a resettlement plan as per this ODs instructions.&#13;
7.    Definition of the Participation Framework&#13;
Stakeholder definition&#13;
A broad range of stakeholders with different, but not necessarily conflicting, interests is&#13;
identifiable for the development of the Center City. The highly heterogeneous composition of&#13;
the center city makes the formulation of an approach that would be acceptable to the whole range&#13;
of stakeholders difficult. It is therefore essential that the social assessment defines the most&#13;
critical groups and ensures that policy and project impact assessment is undertaken separately for&#13;
each of these.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
148&#13;
Of the many stakeholders, those residents of the communal apartments are the most&#13;
vulnerable and require a special focus. It is therefore essential that all legislative, policy and&#13;
engineering proposals developed within the framework of the engineering loan carry out a social&#13;
impact assessment for this group as well as for other low income families.&#13;
While in the short time available for the preparation of this TOR a claim for a&#13;
comprehensive identification of all stakeholders cannot be made'8, key interest groups appear to&#13;
be the following:&#13;
(i)    St. Petersburg Municipality: Other than being the borrower, the client, and the&#13;
counterpart implementation agency, the municipality is the single largest owner of the housing&#13;
19                          20                                          21&#13;
stock in the Center city  . In its seven sub-districts , municipal ownership ranges from 93%   to&#13;
599%22. Given the continuing political unclarity of landownership, municipal ownership of&#13;
23&#13;
land also expands to the privatized housing stock  , thus increasing the stake of the municipality&#13;
24&#13;
in urban rehabilitation  . The municipality is also the single largest manager of the housing&#13;
stock; its crews provide maintenance services throughout the city, even to the privatized&#13;
buildings25.&#13;
Is     And thus the implementation of the TOR would require an independent assessment of all key stakeholders.&#13;
19      By 1995, about 338,000 apartments have been privatized in St. Petersburg. This allows the right to sell or&#13;
lease and has been an important contributor to the process of socio-economic homogenization of buildings. Those&#13;
with financial means, have been selling their sma1l size apartments and buying larger units in more prestigious&#13;
buildings and neighborhoods. This process also contributes to the development of tenant or condo associations.&#13;
20      Four of these have been combined about a year ago into a larger "Central" sub-district. It appears&#13;
advisable for the engineering project to define a territorial scope not broader than this new sub-district.&#13;
21     With 1993 official figures received from the St. Petersburg Statistical Committee (Annex 1).&#13;
22     In other districts and outskirts, municipal ownership is substantially lower, and the share of enterprise&#13;
housing, private housing as well as cooperative housing (not reflected in available statistics) is significantly higher.&#13;
23      This situation also provides an important disincentive for privatization. Especially in deteriorated stock of&#13;
housing, tenants are particularly reluctant to participate in the privatization program not only because they will have&#13;
to pay taxes and assume greater responsibility for maintenance, but also because State responsibility for re-&#13;
allocation or relocation ceases once homes are privatized. For instance, if a building bums down or becomes&#13;
otherwise inhabitable, the public sector assumes no responsibility for the private owners. Thus, tenants of older&#13;
housing stock query the logic for the privatizing their apartments.&#13;
24     While the Law for Condo Associations has not been adopted, there is a Presidential Decree. Accordingly,&#13;
private home owners organizing themselves around such associations become legal owners of land. What this really&#13;
means when the sections of the Civil Code relevant for private landownership is not yet in effect is, however,&#13;
unclear.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
149&#13;
Within the municipal structure, there are of course many departments, each with their&#13;
own responsibility and interest: the department of construction and rehabilitation, of cultural&#13;
heritage, of relocation department, etc. The representation of all relevant departments in a&#13;
26&#13;
steering committee is no doubt important&#13;
The local government has much in stake in ensuring a dynamic rehabilitation program for the&#13;
city. Its political ranks will owe the continuity of their office to the success of this process; those&#13;
in technical and professional roles within the local government have the potential to shape their&#13;
career to the same success.&#13;
It is also worth noting that within the formal municipal maintenance monopoly, an&#13;
informal housing maintenance system is growing, but requires a legally acceptable definition27.&#13;
Nevertheless, it is increasingly necessary to consider the maintenance crew of the municipality&#13;
as an independent stakeholder, one which may resist formal private sector development in&#13;
condo management.&#13;
(ii)      Residents. Several categories of residents are distinguishable, but little is known&#13;
about their socio-economic characteristics 8. While varying from one group to the other, there is&#13;
a remarkable lack of energy within the resident groups to contribute positively to the city's&#13;
rehabilitation efforts. Despite extremely high levels of dissatisfaction with the housing&#13;
conditions, residents do little to improve their own private space, let alone contribute to the&#13;
maintenance of common spaces. Obviously, part of the answer lies in historically conditioned&#13;
behavior patterns and the sharp fall in purchasing power of lower income groups during the&#13;
transition period. Yet, the prevalent levels of citizen passivity cannot all be accounted by these&#13;
factors. As already stressed, there is need for the social assessment to develop a better&#13;
One of the key "pilot" activities under this project may consist of support to the development of municipal&#13;
monopoly in maintenance management.&#13;
26     The mission has already received recommendations concerning the composition of this Steering&#13;
Committee; thus, the stakeholder analyses presented here focuses primarily on the participation framework for non-&#13;
municipal actors.&#13;
27     All municipally owned buildings have cleaning personnel on municipal payroll. If tenants really want the&#13;
cleaning to be done, however, a direct payment is often to be made to the person in charge. If painting, repair and&#13;
similar work is needed, without direct payment to the "master" services are rarely received. The municipality sends&#13;
the master craftsmen with the understanding that he would receive some direct payment. Because the demand for&#13;
such payment is not strictly legal, charges are in accordance with the general level of affordability of the customers.&#13;
The heterogeneous social composition of apartment buildings coupled with lack of tenant associations makes it&#13;
difficult for some of the masters to operate fully independently in the private sector.&#13;
23     It is therefore recommended that this initial stage of the social assessment (corresponding to stakeholder&#13;
identification) carry out a survey of stakeholder characteristics).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
150&#13;
understanding of these issues and identify mechanisms or incentives which would help mobilize&#13;
citizen participation in urban rehabilitation29.&#13;
Owners of privatized housing stock. These are owners of some of the non-communal&#13;
apartments who have chosen to register the residence they were occupying to their own names&#13;
and have thus accepted to pay a certain real estate taxes30. Because privatization provides the&#13;
right to sell, inherit or give away property, those who have left (for other countries), old age&#13;
pensioners and tenants whose flats include a surplus of space compared to the stipulated standard&#13;
were the first to privatize3'.&#13;
A rapid transfonnation of the existing communal housing stock, better management of&#13;
the buildings, the development of tenant or condo associations, the finalization of legislation&#13;
dealing with private land ownership, development of a competitive housing maintenance system&#13;
are all among the major stakes of this group.&#13;
Tenants of individual flats owned by the municipality. This is a highly undefined and&#13;
fluent group and the largest resident stakeholder group within the center city. It is therefore&#13;
critically important to establish the socio-economic characteristics of this group, their levels of&#13;
affordability, their expectations with respect to housing and, especially, their information&#13;
requirements for key decisions concerning privatization, tenant association formation, etc. They&#13;
have much to gain from a successful privatization program, but this can only be articulated if&#13;
their current behavior patters are better understood.&#13;
Tenants of communal housing owned by the municipality. As mentioned above, this&#13;
is a particularly vulnerable group, consisting of about 20% of all residents of St. Petersburg at&#13;
32&#13;
large, and about a third of the residents of the center city  . It is obvious that they are the least&#13;
29     It is worth noting for instance, that major improvements in the potable water supply infrastructure of the&#13;
center city is impossible without full citizen participation in leak prevention. Current levels of household level&#13;
leakage appear extremely high, with potential for positive action difficult given the highly deteriorated condition of&#13;
the housing stock and the high incidence of communal tenancy.&#13;
30     Despite the fact this is less (one/tenth?) than one percent of the assessed value of the property, many&#13;
residents shy away from privatization because of fear of taxes. An affordability study carried out in December 1994&#13;
by the Urban Institute found that majority of the citizens could afford to pay only twice as much as they did for rent&#13;
(consisting primarily of utilities) when they were charged only 1/5th of the actual cost of these utilities. Although&#13;
the rent levels were adjusted subsequent to (or as a result of) the study, the scientific team also established a huge&#13;
default rate with many citizens not paying at all and the majority reluctant to pay taxes.&#13;
31     There has been a net outmigration from the city and a decline in population by about 200,000. This has&#13;
created a breathing space in housing, thus allowing the private sector to move in, buy from occupants of communal&#13;
housing, relocate them in apartments privatized, and sell newly emptied flats to pritave owners.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
151&#13;
influential and lowest income groups. The representation of older age groups and pensioners&#13;
within this group is particularly high. A communal flat of 4-5 bed rooms usually accommodates&#13;
3-4 families or about 9-1 1 persons which share a kitchen, bathroom and toilet. Among them is&#13;
also a large group of "specially privileged" citizens who because of their contributions to the&#13;
Second World War, to the Siege of St. Petersburg, etc., are promised an individual flat.&#13;
There are no legal basis for any authority to relocate this group in parts of the city which&#13;
may be less congested; or is there any hidden agenda for doing so. It is nevertheless obvious that&#13;
communal tenancy is a major bottleneck for the rehabilitation of the city as well as a major social&#13;
problem that needs consolidated attention. For the same reason, it is worth repeating that the&#13;
process of social assessment continuously focus on this group, understanding their needs and&#13;
expectations well, and assessing potential impacts of all proposed policies and programs from&#13;
their perspective33.&#13;
Owners of cooperative housing. There are a number of cooperative housing residents in&#13;
the city. Experts estimated the total housing stock of cooperatives as 16% of the total, but what&#13;
portion of this total is within the center is yet to be established. How new housing policies effect&#13;
this group of residents and how their energies can be mobilized for center city rehabilitation is to&#13;
be assessed.&#13;
Tenants of enterprise housing. The city's housing situation is markedly influenced by&#13;
industrial enterprises which maintain hostel and company housing. Holding on to such&#13;
accommodation is unprofitable while raising the rents is legally prohibited. Attempts to tum&#13;
hostels into hotels have met the resistance of their tenants. Meanwhile the city cannot take&#13;
ownership or responsibility for the hostels and the solution requires consultations both with the&#13;
residents of enterprise hostels and with the enterprises themselves. The extent to which these&#13;
issues are pertinent for Center City development is yet unknown; there is nevertheless a&#13;
substantial stock of enterprise housing within the Center (Annex 1).&#13;
Temporary residents. There is a relatively large group of temporary residents in the&#13;
city, but no statistical information is available about them. This group includes students, job&#13;
hunters, and many others who may be registered in a different part of the city or in another city.&#13;
32     The data of the 1989 census shows 3,209,000 people (1, 099,000 families) living in one family flats; 1,&#13;
118,000 people (485,000 families) living in communal flats; 28,000 people living in houses; 400,000 people living&#13;
in residential hostels; several thousend people living in barracks, and 20,000 people officially homeless.&#13;
33     For instance, there is a proposed legislation to allow residents of communal apartments to privatize their&#13;
own rooms within a flat. While such a move would allow these citizens to sell their rooms and look for another and&#13;
individual flat, it would also remove them from the waiting list of people with entitlement for an individual flat.&#13;
Given low incomes and the low value of a room in a communal flat, many social analyst rightly point to the&#13;
potentially damaging implications of this proposal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
152&#13;
They also include people who can or expect to make multiple claims for privatized apartments in&#13;
different parts of Russia.&#13;
Tenants of boarding homes. There appears to be a relatively large group of people&#13;
living in boarding houses. While some of them may be enterprise employees, others are reported&#13;
to be pensioners and the elderly. Little is known about their housing conditions, entitlements and&#13;
expectations.&#13;
Tenants in social homes. There are several homes for the elderly in the Center city.&#13;
Those visited are new and provide good quality accommodation to the elderly, predominantly&#13;
elderly women with long and recognized careers. The conditions of other social homes (if any&#13;
available for the disabled, or the veterans, etc.) is unknown.&#13;
Tenants/owners of homes which generate income. There is a growing number of&#13;
professional families with relatively good accommodation who are putting a room within their&#13;
flats for tourists. An informal network exists and should be studied in order to built a pilot&#13;
project to support them. This type of an initiative could be particularly valuable for St.&#13;
Petersburg should its intention of hosting the Olympics come true.&#13;
The Elderly. St. Petersburg as a whole and the Center city in particular has a large&#13;
elderly population (over 30%); the majority of the elderly are women and constitute a large&#13;
proportion of those in communal apartments. Again, a large majority of this group belong to the&#13;
'special cases' of veterans of wars, etc., and are also at the top of the "waiting list". In February&#13;
1994, the Russian Government expressed its intention of supporting housing construction by&#13;
making available specially allotted credits for the purchase of housing on the market to those&#13;
citizens who have been longest on the housing waiting list. The majority of these are elderly&#13;
women. As yet, the law has not been passed. Should the law pass, there is danger that these&#13;
credits may be swallowed simply by the corporation's putting up the property prices without&#13;
increasing construction.&#13;
The Homeless. The number of the homeless are obscured by the fact that vagrants,&#13;
beggars, alcoholics are not in a hurry to register themselves. According to experts (Sokolov&#13;
1994), there are 30-50,000 homeless in St. Petersburg and they can be seen in the Center city&#13;
markets, parks and other common places. A social survey has recently been undertaken by a GO&#13;
with this group and local experts believe the existence of a correlation between housing&#13;
privatization and homelessness.&#13;
Special groups. Much of the confusion in the housing allocation results from various&#13;
rules laid down by the Supreme Soviet and Russian Government which stipulates 'special case'&#13;
allocation to a substantial number of social categories such as the military, police and detectives,&#13;
employees of the office of the public prosecutor, refugees, Afghan war veterans, Chernobyl&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
153&#13;
victims, etc. In St. Petersburg, it is very difficult to find housing for all these categories;&#13;
nevertheless political and populist considerations require consideration of their needs. In 1993, in&#13;
order to eliminate distortions in the distribution of the limited public housing available the&#13;
Petrosoviet adopted a special limitation in the distribution of housing by singling its focus on the&#13;
official 'waiting list' only. Given the political realities, however, an assessment of the needs of&#13;
these groups appears advisable.&#13;
Owners of summer homes. According to the USAID financed survey of 1994, about a&#13;
fourth (26%) of all households in St. Petersburg own summer homes; this percentage is higher&#13;
for the residents of the Center City.34 Several processes are evident and may have an impact on&#13;
the Center City rehabilitation process. First, many households with this type of housing have&#13;
been planting food in their gardens, generating in-kind income. Secondly, those with resources&#13;
have been expanding and re-building their second homes and some have started permanent&#13;
residence there, making their Center city residence available for sale or rent. Parallel to this&#13;
process, a substantial level of building (villas) is reported in the outskirts of the city by the&#13;
wealthy families; this process too releases housing for sale or rent in the Center city. Regulations&#13;
concerning these developments therefore will have an impact on urban rehabilitation process and&#13;
their social impacts need thus to be studied.&#13;
(iii) Business community&#13;
Several categories of the business community have a particular stake in the rehabilitation&#13;
of the Center city:&#13;
Construction firms and developers&#13;
Brokers and real estate firms&#13;
Banking Community&#13;
Businesses in search of rental space in the city&#13;
Engineering and Architectural Firms&#13;
Building Materials Companies&#13;
For each of these categories of business, there is an informal sector as well as a rapid&#13;
growing formal sector. Preliminary discussions held with representatives of these groups clearly&#13;
34     Center city residents also have higher incomes and a visibly higher than average car ownership.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
154&#13;
point to the need to assess their interest, the positive and negative contributions they make to the&#13;
rehabilitation processes, possible conflicts of interest among themselves, and between them and&#13;
the other stakeholder groups.&#13;
(iv)   Donors and International and Bilateral Development Agencies&#13;
8.    Proposed Mechanisms for Participation&#13;
These can be summarized under four headings:&#13;
(a)   Information sharing&#13;
(b)   Consultation&#13;
(c)   Collaboration&#13;
(d)   Ownership&#13;
For purposes of information sharing, three mechanisms are appropriate:&#13;
(i)   select number of public hearings on key policy issues and final project draft&#13;
outputs;&#13;
(ii)  targeted public education activities. Some of these will support broad range&#13;
reform agenda (such as the condo association developments), while others may target special&#13;
groups (e.g., in support of the development of a private sector condo management capacity); and&#13;
(iii)  targeted study tours or training programs as discussed above.&#13;
Consultative mechanisms are proposed for all resident groups identified and for business&#13;
community. Under municipal leadership and ownership, a Steering Committee may be&#13;
organized with representation from these groups for consultation purposes. The representation of&#13;
the business community can be ensured through the participation of the relevant associations,&#13;
chambers and boards. Citizen participation is currently made difficult by the fact that the status&#13;
of the groups identified are highly fluent and interchangeable, there is lack of NGOs, and a&#13;
general mistrust and disinterest in civil society development. It is therefore proposed that several&#13;
expert social scientists (or the Institutions they work in) represent the "interest of the&#13;
stakeholders" on the basis of "focused group meetings" to be held with relevant citizen groups&#13;
prior to the consultative meetings. Needless to say, systematic social assessment results will also&#13;
provide views of the resident groups to the Steering Committee. Several names are worth&#13;
suggesting for further discussions with the City administration:&#13;

Prof. Galina Starovoitova, anthropologist&#13;
Prof. Gilinsky, criminologist, Inst. of Sociology&#13;
Collaborative mechanisms will be in place within the different Departments of the City&#13;
Administration and will be defined under the institutional development framework of the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
Ownership is sought at two levels: local government, through participatory inputs&#13;
defined above, will develop and take full ownership of project outputs. Donors will provide the&#13;
needed financial and technical assistance. Ownership is also envisioned for the identification and&#13;
the implementation of the pilot projects.&#13;
9.    Schedule&#13;
As outlined throughout the Terms of Reference, the social assessment in an integral part&#13;
of project development and implementation.&#13;
10.   Budget&#13;
The specific inputs defined for the social assessment are estimated to cost $300,000. The&#13;
participation cost will depend on whether study tours are organized, training held and public&#13;
education programs are conducted. Excluding these, the participation costs are estimated as&#13;
$200,000.&#13;

ST. PETERSBURG CENTER CITY CENTER REHABILITATION&#13;
PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF THE BLOCK 130 PILOT&#13;
PROJECT&#13;
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    This Environmental Assessment was prepared by the St. Petersburg State&#13;
Architectural Institute and Regional Environmental Geology Center, a division of the&#13;
State Geological Enterprise Nevskgeologiya, in accordance with (i) the Russian&#13;
Federation and St. Petersburg environmental legislation and regulations.&#13;
2.    Russian Federation and city of St. Petersburg intend to implement proposed St.&#13;
Petersburg Historic City Center Rehabilitation Engineering Project, to be financed in part&#13;
by a loan from the World Bank. The proposed Project will include, along with provision&#13;
of technical assistance and capacity building, several pilot projects to develop , test, and&#13;
demonstrate efficient and effective mechanisms for rehabilitation of the historic center of&#13;
St. Petersburg. One of the above mentioned pilot projects will be implemented within the&#13;
city Block 130 and will consist of (i) creation of a pedestrian mall between the&#13;
Mayakovsky and Vosstaniya streets; (ii) replacement of the heating plant and network&#13;
within the Block and rehabilitation/replacement of utility infrastructure; and (iii) soil&#13;
removal and. Block 130 was selected for the pilot project implementation and related&#13;
intensive studies because it is representative of conditions that exist elsewhere in the&#13;
center. While the relatively limited physical works are planned under the pilot project,&#13;
some impacts and disturbances are unavoidable and need to be considered and mitigated&#13;
in course of the project planning and implementation. At the same time, successful&#13;
implementation of such projects will allow to develop and replicate mechanisms for&#13;
improving environmental conditions in the entire St. Petersburg city center.&#13;
Background and Baseline Environmental Conditions&#13;
3.   Initial development of the Block 130 can be traced back to the late XVIII century.&#13;
Its territory was primarily used for residential construction, with currently existing&#13;
building stock erected mostly in the XIX century . In addition there are several public&#13;
buildings, including a maternity hospital and secondary school, located in the inner part&#13;
of the Block, an area previously occupied by the public Italian Gardens.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
158&#13;
4.    Existing environmental conditions within the Block 130 are characterized by the&#13;
following:&#13;
Air&#13;
Two old heating boiler plants located within the Block 130 account for most of point&#13;
source air pollution.. Pollution levels, generated by the boilers, normally are relatively&#13;
moderate: SOx concentrations are always significantly below Maximum Permissible&#13;
Concentration (MPC), and CO concentration is higher than MPC only under calm air&#13;
conditions. Exception is NO2 concentration which is generally nearly twice as high as&#13;
MPC. Wind direction does not appear to have significant influence on air pollution levels.&#13;
Automobile traffic is another major factor, contributing to non point pollution. Block 130&#13;
is bordered by Nevsky Prospekt, the major thoroughfare in the city center and primary&#13;
area of the automobile related pollution.&#13;
Water&#13;
There are no permanent surface water bodies within the Block. As the Block is supplied&#13;
with water through the centralized network, local groundwater sources are not used for&#13;
either commercial or household purposes. Depth to surface of the first aquifer is very low.&#13;
Considering that the existing storm water drainage and sewer system is well past its&#13;
useful life period, groundwater contamination via infiltration and pipe leakage is quite&#13;
possible.&#13;
soils&#13;
Geochemical soil surveys undertaken within the Block 130 as part of this Environmental&#13;
Assessment indicated significant heavy metal contamination. For instance, concentrations&#13;
of lead, zinc, cadmium, copper, and nickel exceed Provisional Permissible Concentration&#13;
(PAC) by more than one order of magnitude. Extent of contamination with organic&#13;
compounds was not determined during the Assessment.&#13;
Radioactivity, Noise and Electromagnetic Pollution&#13;
Radioactivity within the Block does not exceed acceptable background levels. Nevsky&#13;
Prospekt and other streets surrounding the Block, generate noise levels of up to 76 dB.&#13;
There are 7 power substations within the Block boundaries, with electromagnetic&#13;
emission levels estimated to be below maximum acceptable.&#13;
Vegetation&#13;
About 2 ha. of the Block territory out of total 13 ha. are covered with vegetation, mostly&#13;
poplar trees (with some lime, maple, elm, and birch) and grass lawns. Public park is&#13;
located in the central part of the Block. State of vegetative cover is unsatisfactory , with&#13;
substantial backlog of overdue landscape management measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
159&#13;
Environmental Benefits&#13;
5.    Several project alternatives were considered. Implementation of the proposed pilot&#13;
project is expected to bring substantial positive environmental impacts including , but not&#13;
limited to, the following:&#13;
*  substantial reduction of point source air pollution and increase in energy&#13;
efficiency due to replacement of the old boiler plants by the new, less fuel-&#13;
consuming and more energy efficient.&#13;
*  reduction of power losses and decrease in electromagnetic pollution via&#13;
rehabilitation/replacement of power distribution network;&#13;
*  reduction of water consumption/losses and soil/groundwater contamination&#13;
due to rehabilitation/replacement of water supply and sewer network;&#13;
*  reduction in non point source air and noise pollution via limiting /restricting&#13;
traffic within the Block;&#13;
*  improvement in environmental health conditions through removal of&#13;
contaminated soil;&#13;
*  introduction of improved landscape management practices;&#13;
*  improvement of air quality and aesthetic appearance via tree replanting.&#13;
In addition to positive environmental impacts, the above measures will&#13;
contribute to cost recovery of the pilot project.&#13;
Negative Impacts and Their Mitigation&#13;
6.    Some inadvertent, if largely temporary, negative environmental impacts are&#13;
expected to take place in course of the pilot project implementation. These include soil&#13;
and vegetation disturbance, temporary incremental noise and air pollution, temporary&#13;
traffic increase, and related disturbances to established pedestrian movement patterns.&#13;
Incremental solid waste will be generated as old pipe, cable, plant etc. will be removed.&#13;
In elation to the above, accepted mitigation measures will need to be introduced. These&#13;
include:&#13;
* appropriate construction equipment/ traffic management and safety practices,&#13;
minimizing disturbances and safety risks;&#13;
* adequate system of waste disposal and scrap metal utilization;&#13;
e appropriate removal and storage of contaminated topsoil; and&#13;
* revegetation;&#13;
Overall, environmental benefits arising from the pilot project implementation will, are&#13;
expected to greatly outweigh the negative impacts.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The goal of the St. Petersburg Center
            City Rehabilitation Project is to support preparation of a
            realistic rehabilitation program.  Specific objectives are
            to: a) further develop and agree with the city and federal
            authorities on a strategic plan and a city investment
            program for center city rehabilitation; b) continue
            regulatory reform to assure competitive real estate markets
            and a competitive business environment in the center city;
            c) initiate a program of public information and
            participation in the decision making process for city
            development and investment; d) carry out visible physical
            improvements that can be replicated on a large scale in the
            future; and e) assist cultural organizations to improve
            their ability to generate non-budget revenue.  The project
            will consist of two components.  The technical cooperation
            component will have two subcomponents: a) planning,
            administration, and engineering; and b) institution building
            and regulatory reform.  The Pilot investment schemes
            component will experiment with and demonstrate new
            mechanisms for providing traditional services or new or
            improved services.
