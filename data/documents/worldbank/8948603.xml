 members of the Centre.The two new members          above.Twenty of the almost thirty cases before&#13;
 are Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic       ICSID in 1999 were cases of this type. Com-&#13;
 of Macedonia. They brought to 131 the total       plex jurisdictional issues often raised in such&#13;
 number of ICSID members.                           cases were addressed in several of the pro-&#13;
                                                    ceedings duringthe year.&#13;
      The proliferation of bilateral and multilat-&#13;
 eral investment treaties has been noted in the         Five of the cases pending before ICSID&#13;
 last few annual reports of the Centre.Over the    duringthe year hadbeen brought to the Cen-&#13;

 this kind has grown by about 1,000 to its         on the settlement of investment disputes. In&#13;
 present level of over 1,300.Duringthe 1990s,      two further NAFTA cases brought under the&#13;
 there were also concluded four multilateral       UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the ICSID&#13;
 treaties with provisions on investment similar to Secretary-General was requested to exercise&#13;
those found inthe bilateral investment treaties.   the appointing authority function entrusted&#13;
 These multilateral treaties notably include the   to him by the NAFTA. During the year, the&#13;
North American Free Trade Agreement, or            Secretary-General was also asked to appoint&#13;
NAFTA.The overwhelming majority of the bi-         arbitrators in an UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules&#13;
lateral investment treaties and each of the four   proceeding initiated under a bilateral invest-&#13;
multilateral treaties contain provisions giving    ment treaty and in two cases brought under&#13;

including the NAFTA, give covered investors        onthe parties and not subject to any appeal or&#13;
the choice between resorting to ICSID arbitra-     to any other remedy except those providedin&#13;
tion or to arbitration under the 1976Arbitration   the Convention. The remedies provided for in&#13;
Rules of the UnitedNations Commission on In-       the Convention notably include revision and&#13;
ternational Trade Law, or UNCITRAL, with the       annulment. In several cases submitted to the&#13;
ICSID Secretary-General as the appointing au-      Centre in the 198Os,there were requests for&#13;
thority of arbitrators.                            annulment of the award. Until recently, there&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Note 1-Organization&#13;
&#13;
The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre) was established on&#13;
October 14, 1966 to provide facilities for the conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes&#13;
between States and nationals of other States. On February 13, 1967, the International Bank for&#13;
Reconstructionand Development (the Bank) andthe Centre entered into Administrative Arrange-&#13;
ments which were effective as of the date of the establishment of the Centre.The Memorandum of&#13;
Administrative Arrangements (the Memorandum) provides that, except to the extent that the Cen-&#13;
tre may be rembursed bythe parties to proceedings for fees and expenses of members of Con-&#13;
ciliation Commissions,Arbitral Tribunals or ad hoc Committees, the Bank shall provide facilities&#13;
and services to the Centre, as describedinNotes 2 and 3.&#13;
&#13;
Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#13;
&#13;
Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation: The financial statements have&#13;
beenprepared inaccordance with generally accepted accountingprinciples inthe United States&#13;
and with InternationalAccounting Standards. Such financial statements are presented in accor-&#13;
dance with Statement of FinancialAccounting StandardNo. 117,"FinancialStatements ofNot-For-&#13;
Profit-Organizations" (SFAS No. 117). SFAS No 117 requires that net assets are classified in&#13;
accordance with donor restrictions;however,there are nonet assets as ofJune 30, 1999 and 1998.&#13;
&#13;
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements inconformity with generally accepted&#13;
accountingprinciples requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the re-&#13;
ported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the&#13;
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during&#13;
the reportingperiod.Actual results could differ from these estimates.&#13;
&#13;
Cash Equivalents: The Centre considers all highly liquiddebt investments purchased with an&#13;
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents,&#13;
&#13;
Value ofservices provided by the Bank and in-kind contributions: Inaccordance with State-&#13;
ment of FinancialAccounting Standard No 116,"Accountmgfor ContributionsReceived and Con-&#13;
tributionsMade," the value of services provided by the Bank is determined by the estimated fair&#13;
value of these services and is recorded by the Centre as in-kindcontributions and also as ex-&#13;
penses of the Centre.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Annex 3 (continued)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The Bank provides support services and facilities to the Centre includingthe following:&#13;
&#13;
     (1) the services of staff members and consultants; and&#13;
     (2) other administrative services andfacilities, such as travel, communications, office accom-&#13;
         modations, furniture, epipment, supplies andprinting.&#13;
&#13;
Revenue recognition from arbitration proceedings: The Centre does nothave resources of its&#13;
own. The Centre's direct expenses attrlbutable to arbitration proceedings are borne by the par-&#13;
ties inaccordance with the Centre'sAdministrative andFinancialRegulations (Regulations). Inac-&#13;
cordance with these Regulations, the Secretary-General calls on the parties to make advance&#13;
deposits with the Centre from time to time to defray these anticipated expenses.Accordingly the&#13;
Centre recognizes revenuesfrom these exchange transactions duringthe period of andto the ex-&#13;
tent of expenses incurred relatedto arbitration proceedings. If,after the completion of an arbitra-&#13;
tion proceeding,it is determined that there is a cash surplus, such surplus shallb e refundedto the&#13;
parties inproportionto the amounts advanced by each party to the Centre&#13;

To International Centre for Settlement&#13;
     of Investment Disputes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We have auditedthe accompanying statements of financial positionofthe International Centre for&#13;
Settlement of InvestmentDisputes (the Centre) as ofJune 30, 1999and 1998,andthe relatedstate-&#13;
ments of activities andcashflows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the re-&#13;
sponsibility of the management of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
(IBRD) and of the Centre. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements&#13;
based on our audits.&#13;
&#13;
We conductedour audits inaccordance with generally accepted auditing standards inthe United&#13;
States ofAmerica andwith the International Standards onAuditing. Those standards require that&#13;
we plan andperform the audit to obtainreasonable assurance about whether the financial state-&#13;
ments are free of material misstatement. An aud        cludes examining, on a test basis, evidence&#13;
supportingthe amounts anddisclosures inthe financial statements. An audit also includes assess-&#13;
ingthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as&#13;
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a rea-&#13;
sonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
&#13;
Inour opinion, such financial statementspresent fairly inall materialrespects, the financial posi-&#13;
tion ofthe International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes as ofJune 30, 1999and 1998,&#13;
andthe change inits net assets andcash flows for the years then endedinconformity with gener-&#13;
ally accepted accounting principles inthe United States of America and with InternationalAc-&#13;
countingStandards.&#13;

            This annual report concerns the
            International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
            (ICSID). During fiscal year 1999, two more countries
            ratified the ICSID Convention to become members of the
            Centre. Five of the cases pending before ICSID during the
            year had been brought to the Centre on the basis of the
            provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement
            (NAFTA) on the settlement of investment disputes.  The
            authors have audited the accompanying statements of
            financial position of the ISCID (the Centre) as of June 30,
            1999 and 1998, and the related statements of activities and
            cash flows for the years then ended. In all, the past year
            was one in which ICSID consolidated as the leading center
            for the resolution of investment disputes between states and
            foreign investors and for the dissemination of knowledge on
            arbitration and foreign investment law.
