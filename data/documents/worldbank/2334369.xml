the &#13;

of &#13;
the &#13;

amend &#13;

(4585-AR) &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
terms &#13;
described &#13;
in &#13;
paragraphs &#13;
14-24 below. &#13;
The &#13;
proposed &#13;
amendment &#13;
would &#13;
allow &#13;
the &#13;
Province &#13;
of &#13;
Cordoba &#13;
to &#13;
meet &#13;
the &#13;
overall &#13;
objectives &#13;
of &#13;
its &#13;
reform &#13;
program, &#13;
as &#13;
previously &#13;
approved &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
Board, &#13;
by &#13;
taking &#13;
into &#13;
account &#13;
the &#13;
impact &#13;
of &#13;
subsequent &#13;
and &#13;
fundamental &#13;
changes &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
and &#13;
investment &#13;
environment &#13;
and &#13;
social conditions &#13;
in &#13;
Argentina. &#13;
The &#13;
proposed &#13;
amendment &#13;
remains &#13;
firmly &#13;
grounded &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
overall &#13;
objectives &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
loan to &#13;
promote &#13;
fiscal stability &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
provincial &#13;
level, &#13;
strengthen &#13;
the &#13;
role &#13;
of &#13;
private &#13;
capital &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
business &#13;
climate, &#13;
and &#13;
promote  structural  reforms &#13;
to &#13;
improve &#13;
the &#13;
efficiency,  quality &#13;
and &#13;
equity &#13;
of &#13;
public &#13;
spending, &#13;
particularly &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
social &#13;
sectors, &#13;
in &#13;
Cordoba. &#13;
2. &#13;
The &#13;
proposed &#13;
reformulation &#13;
would &#13;
amend &#13;
the &#13;
original &#13;
second &#13;
and &#13;
third &#13;
tranches &#13;
of &#13;
$100 &#13;
million &#13;
each, &#13;
while &#13;
splitting &#13;
the &#13;
original &#13;
third &#13;
tranche &#13;
into &#13;
a &#13;
revised &#13;
third &#13;
tranche &#13;
of &#13;
$25 &#13;
million &#13;
and &#13;
a &#13;
new &#13;
fourth &#13;
tranche &#13;
of &#13;
$75 &#13;
million. &#13;
This &#13;
approach &#13;
reflects &#13;
the &#13;
substantial &#13;
progress &#13;
made &#13;
so &#13;
far &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
implementation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
reform &#13;
program, &#13;
and &#13;
it &#13;
provides &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
reframing &#13;
of &#13;
a &#13;
consistent &#13;
program &#13;
in &#13;
response &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
changes &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
country &#13;
environment through &#13;
an &#13;
upfront &#13;
agreement &#13;
on revised &#13;
targets &#13;
to &#13;
achieve &#13;
the &#13;
agreed &#13;
development &#13;
goals. &#13;
Upon &#13;
the &#13;
Board&#146;s approval &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
proposed &#13;
reformulation, &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
declaration of &#13;
effectiveness &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
legal &#13;
amendment, &#13;
the &#13;
Bank &#13;
would &#13;
advise &#13;
the &#13;
authorities &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
revised &#13;
second and &#13;
third &#13;
tranches &#13;
for &#13;
a &#13;
total &#13;
amount &#13;
of &#13;
$125 &#13;
million &#13;
would &#13;
be &#13;

3. &#13;
After &#13;
plunging &#13;
into &#13;
a &#13;
deep &#13;
crisis &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
first &#13;
few  months &#13;
of &#13;
2002, &#13;
the &#13;
Argentine &#13;
economy &#13;
reached &#13;
a &#13;
certain &#13;
degree &#13;
of &#13;
stability &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
half &#13;
of &#13;
last &#13;
year. &#13;
This &#13;
stability &#13;
was &#13;
characterized &#13;
by: &#13;
(i) &#13;
an &#13;
interruption &#13;
in &#13;
output &#13;
decline, &#13;
and &#13;
gradual &#13;
recovery toward &#13;
the &#13;
latter &#13;
part &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
year; &#13;
(ii) &#13;
a &#13;
stabilization &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
exchange &#13;
rate, &#13;
albeit &#13;
at &#13;
a &#13;
much &#13;
depreciated &#13;
level; &#13;
and &#13;
(iii) &#13;
a &#13;
broad &#13;
balance &#13;
between &#13;
revenues and &#13;
non-interest &#13;
expenditures, &#13;
although &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
expense &#13;
of &#13;
non &#13;
payment &#13;
of &#13;
public &#13;
debt &#13;
obligations &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
compression &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
real &#13;
value &#13;
of &#13;
public &#13;
sector &#13;
wages &#13;
and &#13;
pension &#13;
benefits. &#13;
This &#13;
stabilization &#13;
has &#13;
engendered an &#13;
overall &#13;
increase &#13;
in &#13;
optimism &#13;
about &#13;
the &#13;
short &#13;
run &#13;
prospects &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;

Fiscal &#13;
developments &#13;
in &#13;
2002. &#13;
Central &#13;
to &#13;
achieving &#13;
the &#13;
economic &#13;
stabilization &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
half &#13;
of &#13;
2002 &#13;
was &#13;
the &#13;
improvement &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
consolidated &#13;
fiscal &#13;
position &#13;
on &#13;
a &#13;
cash basis. &#13;
At &#13;
the &#13;
federal government &#13;
level, &#13;
there &#13;
was &#13;
a &#13;
shift &#13;
from &#13;
a &#13;
balanced &#13;
primary position &#13;
in &#13;
2001 &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
0.7 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
GDP &#13;
primary &#13;
surplus &#13;
in &#13;
2002. &#13;
The &#13;
improvement &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
fiscal position &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
level &#13;
reflected &#13;
the &#13;
revision &#13;
of &#13;
tax &#13;
sharing &#13;
agreements &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
(see &#13;
below), &#13;
the &#13;
broadening &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
tax &#13;
base, &#13;
and &#13;
tight &#13;
controls &#13;
of &#13;
expenditures. &#13;
Broadening &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
tax &#13;
base &#13;
resulted &#13;
primarily from &#13;
higher &#13;
taxes &#13;
on &#13;
exports, &#13;
which &#13;
by &#13;
end-December accounted &#13;
for &#13;
12 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
total &#13;
tax &#13;
revenues, &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
impact &#13;
of &#13;
inflation &#13;
on &#13;
revenues &#13;
in &#13;
general, &#13;
including &#13;
the &#13;
financial &#13;
transactions tax. &#13;
On &#13;
the &#13;
expenditure &#13;
side, &#13;
there &#13;
was &#13;
compression &#13;
in &#13;
public &#13;
wages &#13;
and &#13;
pensions &#13;
through &#13;
inflation,  leading &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
loss &#13;
of &#13;
around one-quarter &#13;
of &#13;
their &#13;
real &#13;
value. &#13;
Cash &#13;
interest &#13;
payments &#13;
also &#13;
fell &#13;
sharply &#13;
following &#13;
the &#13;
default &#13;
on &#13;
most &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
public &#13;
debt &#13;
in &#13;
late &#13;
2001. &#13;
5. &#13;
Provincial &#13;
finances &#13;
in &#13;
2002. &#13;
At &#13;
the &#13;
provincial &#13;
level, &#13;
there &#13;
was &#13;
a &#13;
72 &#13;
percent &#13;
decline &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
overall &#13;
primary deficit, &#13;
from &#13;
1.5 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
GDP &#13;
in &#13;
2001 to &#13;
near &#13;
balance &#13;
in &#13;
2002. &#13;
A &#13;
decline &#13;
in &#13;
expenditures &#13;
accounted &#13;
for &#13;
93 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
deficit &#13;
reduction, &#13;
while &#13;
an &#13;
increase &#13;
in &#13;
revenues &#13;
explained &#13;
the &#13;
remaining &#13;
7 &#13;
percent. &#13;
Lower &#13;
spending &#13;
on &#13;
interest &#13;
payments &#13;
was &#13;
the &#13;
main &#13;
factor &#13;
explaining &#13;
the &#13;
decline &#13;
in &#13;
expenditures, &#13;
although &#13;
lower &#13;
capital &#13;
expenditures &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
erosion &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
real &#13;
value &#13;
of &#13;
spending &#13;
on &#13;
personnel &#13;
and &#13;
transfers &#13;
to &#13;
households &#13;
also &#13;
contributed &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
expenditure  decline. &#13;
While &#13;
overall &#13;
revenues &#13;
remained almost &#13;
unchanged, &#13;
there &#13;
were &#13;
significant variations &#13;
across &#13;
revenue &#13;
categories. &#13;
There &#13;
were declines &#13;
in &#13;
revenues &#13;
coming &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
government &#13;
and &#13;
most non-tax &#13;
revenues. &#13;
These &#13;
declines were &#13;
partially  offset &#13;
however &#13;
by &#13;
increases &#13;
in &#13;
provincial &#13;
own &#13;
tax &#13;
revenues &#13;
and &#13;
royalties &#13;
from &#13;
oil &#13;
production. &#13;
6. &#13;
Monetary and &#13;
exchange &#13;
rate &#13;
stability. &#13;
The &#13;
government's &#13;
balanced &#13;
cash &#13;
fiscal &#13;
position &#13;
meant &#13;
that &#13;
monetary &#13;
policy &#13;
could &#13;
focus &#13;
on &#13;
stabilizing &#13;
the &#13;
exchange &#13;
rate. &#13;
Exchange &#13;
rate &#13;
stability &#13;
was &#13;
achieved &#13;
by &#13;
mid-year &#13;
due, &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
large &#13;
extent, &#13;
to  foreign &#13;
currency regulations &#13;
requiring &#13;
exporters &#13;
to &#13;
surrender &#13;
export &#13;
earnings &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
central &#13;
bank. &#13;
Foreign &#13;
currency regulations &#13;
provided &#13;
the &#13;
Argentine &#13;
authorities &#13;
with &#13;
ample &#13;
supply &#13;
of &#13;
foreign &#13;
currency, &#13;
albeit &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
absence &#13;
of &#13;
debt &#13;
servicing &#13;
due &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
default &#13;
status, &#13;
allowing &#13;
international &#13;
reserves &#13;
to  stabilize &#13;
and &#13;
slowly &#13;
recover. &#13;
The &#13;
increase &#13;
in &#13;
international &#13;
reserves, &#13;
combined &#13;
with &#13;
a &#13;
gradual recovery &#13;
of &#13;
deposits &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
banking &#13;
system, &#13;
led &#13;
in &#13;
turn &#13;
to rapid &#13;
monetary &#13;
expansion, &#13;
especially &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
last &#13;
quarter &#13;
of &#13;
2002, &#13;
despite &#13;
sterilization &#13;
efforts &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
central &#13;
bank. &#13;
Also, &#13;
large &#13;
trade &#13;
surpluses and &#13;
weak &#13;
demand &#13;
for &#13;
dollars &#13;
meant &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
peso &#13;
gradually &#13;
gained  strength &#13;
against &#13;
the &#13;
dollar. &#13;
The &#13;
currency &#13;
appreciation &#13;
provided &#13;
the &#13;
government &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
opportunity to &#13;
ease &#13;
some &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
foreign &#13;
exchange &#13;
regulations,' &#13;
signaling &#13;
an &#13;
important &#13;
first &#13;
step &#13;
toward &#13;
normalizing &#13;
the &#13;
operations &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
foreign &#13;
exchange &#13;
market. &#13;
To &#13;
ensure &#13;
monetary &#13;
and  exchange &#13;
rate &#13;
stability &#13;
in &#13;
2003, &#13;
however, &#13;
more &#13;
will &#13;
need &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
done &#13;
by &#13;
generating larger &#13;
fiscal &#13;
Importers of &#13;
capital &#13;
goods and &#13;
spare &#13;
parts &#13;
were &#13;
allowed &#13;
to &#13;
pay &#13;
100 &#13;
percent &#13;
cash &#13;
in &#13;
advance, &#13;
reducing &#13;
barriers &#13;
to &#13;
new &#13;
investments. &#13;
Similarly, &#13;
exporters &#13;

no &#13;

More &#13;
importantly, &#13;
the &#13;
Central &#13;
Bank &#13;
lifted &#13;
restrictions on &#13;
external &#13;
debt payments &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
private &#13;
sector, &#13;
with &#13;
no restrictions &#13;
on &#13;
interest &#13;
payments and &#13;
fewer &#13;
restrictions &#13;
on &#13;
principal &#13;
repayments. &#13;
Finally, &#13;
the &#13;
limit &#13;
on &#13;
foreign &#13;
currency &#13;
in &#13;
bank &#13;
portfolios &#13;
were increased, and &#13;

IMF &#13;
program. &#13;
The &#13;
IMF&#146;s &#13;
short-term &#13;
transitional &#13;
program &#13;
aims &#13;
at &#13;
bridging &#13;
the &#13;
period &#13;
between &#13;
the &#13;
Presidential election on &#13;
April &#13;
27 &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
first &#13;
few &#13;
months &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
next administration &#13;
by &#13;
ensuring &#13;
fiscal &#13;
and &#13;
monetary &#13;
stability during &#13;
the &#13;
transition. &#13;
This &#13;
would &#13;
set &#13;
the &#13;
stage &#13;
for &#13;
a &#13;
more &#13;
comprehensive &#13;
program &#13;
of &#13;
fundamental reforms, &#13;
tackling &#13;
the &#13;
structural &#13;
problems &#13;
confronting &#13;
Argentina. &#13;
The &#13;
transitional &#13;
program includes &#13;
actions &#13;
to: &#13;
(i) &#13;
raise &#13;
tax &#13;
revenue &#13;
to &#13;
ensure &#13;
fiscal stability &#13;
at &#13;
all &#13;
levels &#13;
of &#13;
government; &#13;
(ii) &#13;
initiate &#13;
the &#13;
normalization &#13;
of &#13;
relations &#13;
with &#13;
foreign &#13;
investors, &#13;
including &#13;
initial &#13;
contacts &#13;
with &#13;
foreign &#13;
bondholders, &#13;
and &#13;
an &#13;
assessment &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
legal &#13;
and &#13;
regulatory &#13;
framework &#13;
in &#13;
which &#13;
the &#13;
renegotiation &#13;
of &#13;
public &#13;
services &#13;
and &#13;
infrastructure &#13;
concessions &#13;
is &#13;
being &#13;
conducted; &#13;
and &#13;
(iii) &#13;
renewal of last &#13;
year&#146;s &#13;
the &#13;
federal-provincial &#13;
agreement, &#13;
ensuring &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
latter &#13;
meet &#13;
agreed &#13;
fiscal &#13;
targets. &#13;
In &#13;
parallel, &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
provincial &#13;
governments have &#13;
agreed &#13;
to &#13;
continue &#13;
undertaking &#13;
reforms &#13;
aimed &#13;
at: &#13;
(i) &#13;
ensuring &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
are &#13;
able &#13;
to &#13;
continue &#13;
delivering &#13;
key  social &#13;
services &#13;
(health, &#13;
education &#13;
and &#13;
social &#13;
assistance), &#13;
especially &#13;
those &#13;
targeted &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
poor; &#13;
(ii) &#13;
strengthening &#13;
the &#13;
equity &#13;
and &#13;
financial &#13;
sustainability of &#13;
the &#13;
national &#13;
public &#13;
pension &#13;
system; and &#13;
(iii) &#13;
raising &#13;
the &#13;
efficiency &#13;
of &#13;
tax &#13;
administration. &#13;
The &#13;
IMF &#13;
supported &#13;
program &#13;
is &#13;
on &#13;
track. &#13;

Prospects. &#13;
Argentina&#146;s &#13;
prospects &#13;
for &#13;
2003 &#13;
are &#13;
the &#13;
continuation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
current &#13;
recovery &#13;
in &#13;
output &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
maintenance &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
fiscal &#13;
and &#13;
monetary &#13;
stability &#13;
reached &#13;
over &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
half &#13;
of &#13;
last &#13;
year. &#13;
The &#13;
prospects &#13;
for &#13;
output recovery &#13;
reflects &#13;
the &#13;
depth &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
output decline &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
last &#13;
4 &#13;
years &#13;
(20 &#13;
percent) &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
opportunities &#13;
provided &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
sharp &#13;
devaluation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
currency. &#13;
Export &#13;
and &#13;
import  substituting activities &#13;
will &#13;
therefore &#13;
continue &#13;
leading &#13;
the &#13;
recovery, &#13;
with &#13;
real &#13;
GDP &#13;
growth &#13;
projected &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
3.5 &#13;
to &#13;
4 &#13;
percent &#13;
range. &#13;
To &#13;
sustain &#13;
the &#13;
recovery, &#13;
vigorous &#13;
fiscal &#13;
management &#13;
will &#13;
need &#13;
to &#13;
continue &#13;
targeting &#13;
consolidated &#13;
primary fiscal &#13;
surpluses, &#13;
increasing &#13;
from &#13;
a &#13;
slight &#13;
surplus &#13;
in &#13;
2002 &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
2.5 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
GDP &#13;
surplus &#13;
by &#13;
end-2003. &#13;
Also, &#13;
tax &#13;
administration &#13;
will &#13;
need &#13;
to &#13;
continue &#13;
to &#13;
improve, &#13;
so &#13;
that &#13;
tax  receipts &#13;
keep &#13;
rising &#13;
with &#13;
output. &#13;
Strong &#13;
fiscal &#13;
management and &#13;
a &#13;
stable &#13;
exchange &#13;
rate &#13;
should &#13;
restrain &#13;
inflation, &#13;
curtailing &#13;
demands &#13;
for &#13;
adjustments &#13;
in &#13;
expenditures (especially &#13;
wages, &#13;
salaries &#13;
and &#13;
pension &#13;
benefits). &#13;
9. &#13;
In &#13;
view &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
above, &#13;
Argentina&#146;s &#13;
current macroeconomic &#13;
framework &#13;
provides &#13;
the &#13;
basis &#13;
for &#13;
a &#13;
transitional &#13;
program &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
IFIs. &#13;
This &#13;
transitional &#13;
program &#13;
seeks &#13;
to &#13;
ensure &#13;
fiscal &#13;
and &#13;
monetary &#13;
stability &#13;
by &#13;
taking &#13;
steps &#13;
to &#13;
guarantee &#13;
(i) &#13;
a &#13;
broad &#13;
balance &#13;
between &#13;
revenues &#13;
and &#13;
non-interest &#13;
expenditures; &#13;
(ii) &#13;
the &#13;
provision &#13;
of &#13;
key &#13;
public &#13;
services, &#13;
especially &#13;
those &#13;
targeted &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
poor; &#13;
and &#13;
(iii) &#13;
the &#13;
continuation &#13;
of &#13;
reforms &#13;
aimed &#13;
at &#13;
improving &#13;
efficiency &#13;
in &#13;
tax &#13;
administration &#13;
and &#13;
expenditure &#13;
management. &#13;
Success &#13;
in &#13;
implementing &#13;
this &#13;
transitory &#13;
program &#13;
will &#13;
be measured &#13;
by &#13;
achievements &#13;
in &#13;
preserving &#13;
the &#13;
stability &#13;
reached &#13;
over &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
half &#13;
of &#13;
last &#13;
year, &#13;
and &#13;
sustaining &#13;
the &#13;
current &#13;
output &#13;
recovery. &#13;
10. &#13;
Investment &#13;
Climate. &#13;
Since &#13;
Argentina &#13;
defaulted &#13;
on &#13;
its &#13;
sovereign &#13;
debt &#13;
and &#13;
abandoned &#13;
the &#13;
currency &#13;
board &#13;
regime &#13;
in &#13;
early &#13;
2002, &#13;
privatized &#13;
services &#13;
including &#13;
telecom, &#13;
gas, &#13;
electricity, &#13;
water, &#13;
and &#13;
transport, &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
subject &#13;
to &#13;
extreme &#13;
conditions. &#13;
These &#13;
include &#13;
the &#13;
&#147;pesification&#148; &#13;
of &#13;
their &#13;
tariffs &#13;
(a &#13;
contractual &#13;
breakdown &#13;
since &#13;
tariffs &#13;
were &#13;
by &#13;
contract &#13;
linked &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
dollar), &#13;
the &#13;
balance &#13;
sheet &#13;
effect &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
peso &#13;
devaluation &#13;
given &#13;
the &#13;
foreign &#13;
currency &#13;
denominated &#13;
debt &#13;
of &#13;
firms, &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
income deterioration &#13;
of &#13;
its &#13;
clients &#13;
(due &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
4 &#13;
year &#13;
recession &#13;
but &#13;
further &#13;
aggravated &#13;
since &#13;
the &#13;
devaluation) &#13;
which &#13;
led &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
rapid &#13;
surge &#13;
in &#13;
non-compliance &#13;
with &#13;
payments. &#13;
The &#13;
legal &#13;
and &#13;
economic &#13;
uncertainty &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
sector &#13;
was &#13;
further &#13;
exacerbated &#13;
by &#13;
changes &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
bankruptcy &#13;
law &#13;
and &#13;
pesification &#13;
of &#13;
all &#13;
contracts &#13;
that &#13;
eroded &#13;
property rights &#13;
in &#13;
general. &#13;
In &#13;
this &#13;
environment, &#13;
concessions &#13;
were &#13;
induced &#13;
to &#13;
revise &#13;
their &#13;
investment &#13;
and &#13;
maintenance &#13;
contractual &#13;
obligations &#13;
while &#13;
restructuring or &#13;
perhaps &#13;
even &#13;
defaulting &#13;
on &#13;
their &#13;
external &#13;
debt &#13;
obligations. &#13;
With &#13;
the &#13;
breakdown of  contractual &#13;
obligations &#13;
the &#13;
sector &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
operating &#13;
in &#13;
a &#13;
regulatory &#13;
vacuum &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
risks &#13;
of &#13;
abandonment &#13;
of &#13;
investment &#13;
programs, &#13;
interruption &#13;
of &#13;
services, &#13;
and &#13;
tensions &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
government &#13;
regarding &#13;
tariff &#13;
adjustments. &#13;
11. &#13;
issues &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
While &#13;
the &#13;
Bank &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
working &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
government &#13;
to &#13;
begin resolving &#13;
these &#13;
in &#13;
order &#13;
to &#13;

will &#13;
largely &#13;
depend &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
re- &#13;
establishment &#13;
of &#13;
a &#13;
regulatory framework &#13;
that &#13;
effectively &#13;
deals &#13;
with &#13;
such &#13;
issues &#13;
as &#13;
tariff &#13;
adjustments, &#13;
quality &#13;
of &#13;

The &#13;
social &#13;
impact &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
crisis &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
devastating. &#13;
Using &#13;
data &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
official &#13;

and &#13;
recently compiled &#13;
World &#13;

During &#13;

dramatically. &#13;
The &#13;

The &#13;
economic &#13;
crisis &#13;
has &#13;
had &#13;
a &#13;
strong &#13;
negative &#13;
impact &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
access &#13;
and &#13;
use &#13;
of &#13;
education &#13;
and &#13;
health &#13;
services &#13;
and there &#13;
is &#13;
growing &#13;
evidence &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
deterioration &#13;
in &#13;
service &#13;
delivery &#13;
and &#13;
key &#13;
indicators &#13;
of &#13;
well-being. &#13;
Coverage &#13;
and &#13;
financing &#13;
of &#13;
formal &#13;
health &#13;
insurance &#13;
has &#13;
dropped &#13;
significantly, &#13;
following &#13;
the &#13;
destruction &#13;
of &#13;
jobs &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
formal &#13;
sector. &#13;
Roughly &#13;
12 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
individuals &#13;
with &#13;
formal &#13;
health &#13;
insurance &#13;
either &#13;
discontinued &#13;
(60 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
total), &#13;
or &#13;
reduced &#13;
their &#13;
coverage. &#13;
The &#13;
trend &#13;
has &#13;
contributed &#13;
to &#13;
an &#13;
increase &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
use &#13;
of &#13;
already &#13;
financially &#13;
strapped &#13;
public &#13;
hospitals, &#13;
the &#13;
traditional provider &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
uninsured. &#13;
The &#13;
crisis &#13;
has &#13;
forced &#13;
families &#13;
to &#13;
cut &#13;
down &#13;
on &#13;
health &#13;
services. &#13;
More &#13;
than &#13;
one-third &#13;
of &#13;
households &#13;
with &#13;
children &#13;
under &#13;
the &#13;
age &#13;
of &#13;
12 &#13;
reported &#13;
having &#13;
reduced &#13;
the &#13;
frequency &#13;
with &#13;
which &#13;
they &#13;
take &#13;
their &#13;
children &#13;
for &#13;
medical &#13;
checkups &#13;
(roughly &#13;
half &#13;
of &#13;
those &#13;
households &#13;
belong to &#13;
the &#13;
lowest &#13;
quintile &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
income &#13;
distribution). &#13;
There &#13;
are &#13;
concems &#13;
about &#13;
the &#13;
emergence &#13;
of &#13;
cases &#13;
of child &#13;
malnutrition. &#13;
2 &#13;
14. &#13;
In &#13;
the &#13;
education &#13;
sector &#13;
there &#13;
are &#13;
no &#13;
indications &#13;
of &#13;
aggravated &#13;
dropout &#13;
and &#13;
desertion &#13;
rates &#13;
due &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
crisis. &#13;
On &#13;
the &#13;
other &#13;
hand, &#13;
a &#13;
large &#13;
proportion &#13;
of &#13;
households &#13;
report &#13;
that &#13;
they &#13;
have &#13;
reduced &#13;
school &#13;
and &#13;
learning &#13;
material &#13;
purchases. &#13;
The &#13;
most &#13;
serious &#13;
negative effects &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
crisis &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
education &#13;
sector &#13;
are &#13;
linked &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
fiscal &#13;
provincial &#13;
crisis. &#13;
The &#13;
lack &#13;
of &#13;
financing &#13;
experienced &#13;
by &#13;
several &#13;
provinces &#13;
has &#13;
generated &#13;
difficulties &#13;
to  comply &#13;
with &#13;
payments &#13;
to &#13;
their &#13;
employees, &#13;
including &#13;
teachers. &#13;
Delays &#13;
in &#13;
wage &#13;
payments &#13;
have &#13;
had &#13;
an &#13;
impact &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
continuity &#13;
of &#13;
classes. &#13;
While &#13;
experiences have &#13;
differed &#13;
within &#13;
the &#13;
country &#13;
due &#13;
in &#13;
part &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
higher &#13;
or &#13;
lower &#13;
solvency &#13;
in &#13;
which &#13;
each &#13;
state, &#13;
the &#13;
2002 &#13;
school &#13;
year was &#13;
irreparably &#13;
affected &#13;
in &#13;
some &#13;
provinces &#13;
(San &#13;
Juan, &#13;
Entre &#13;
Rios), &#13;
very seriously affected &#13;
in &#13;
others &#13;
(TucumAn, &#13;
Jujuy, &#13;
Rio &#13;
Negro), &#13;
and &#13;
had &#13;
partial &#13;
scope &#13;
in &#13;
a &#13;
third &#13;
group &#13;
of &#13;
provinces &#13;
(Misiones, &#13;
Formosa, &#13;
Chubut). &#13;
The &#13;
difference &#13;
among &#13;
them &#13;
is &#13;
the &#13;
number &#13;
of &#13;
school &#13;
days &#13;
lost, &#13;
ranging &#13;
from &#13;
about &#13;
a &#13;
quarter &#13;
to &#13;
almost &#13;
half &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
school &#13;
year.3 &#13;
15. &#13;
What &#13;
is &#13;
different &#13;
is &#13;
that &#13;
2002 &#13;
has &#13;
made &#13;
the &#13;
social situation &#13;
even &#13;
more &#13;
difficult &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
majority &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
population &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
need &#13;
for &#13;
action more &#13;
urgent. &#13;
Discussions &#13;
and &#13;
reform &#13;
proposals &#13;
to &#13;
correct &#13;
the &#13;
underlying &#13;
problems &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
ongoing &#13;
for &#13;
several &#13;
years &#13;
without &#13;
reaching &#13;
a &#13;
conclusion &#13;
as &#13;
a &#13;
result &#13;
of &#13;
insufficient &#13;
political &#13;
support &#13;
and &#13;
social &#13;
consensus. &#13;
The &#13;
Government &#13;
now &#13;
faces &#13;
a &#13;
particularly &#13;
difficult &#13;
challenge: &#13;
increasing &#13;
demands &#13;
for &#13;
social &#13;
assistance &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
context &#13;
of &#13;
falling &#13;
fiscal &#13;
resources &#13;
and &#13;
extremely &#13;
limited &#13;
administrative &#13;
Many &#13;
of &#13;
these &#13;
social &#13;
problems &#13;
have &#13;
existed &#13;
before &#13;
in &#13;
Argentina. &#13;
While &#13;
there &#13;
is &#13;
no &#13;
updated &#13;
aggregate &#13;
official &#13;
data &#13;
that &#13;
would allow &#13;
to &#13;
determine &#13;
the &#13;
extent to &#13;
which &#13;
there &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
a &#13;
deterioration &#13;
in &#13;
infant &#13;
mortality &#13;
and &#13;
malnutrition, &#13;
evidence &#13;
of &#13;
serious &#13;
child &#13;
malnutrition &#13;
(and &#13;
a &#13;
failure &#13;
of &#13;
existing &#13;
programs &#13;
to &#13;
identify &#13;
those &#13;
cases &#13;
in &#13;
time) &#13;
has &#13;
emerged &#13;
recently &#13;
in &#13;
several &#13;
provinces &#13;
raising &#13;
the &#13;
concern &#13;
that, &#13;
if &#13;
left &#13;
unattended, &#13;
this &#13;
could &#13;
develop &#13;
into &#13;
a &#13;
graver &#13;
health &#13;
emergency. &#13;
The &#13;
interruption &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
educational &#13;
process &#13;
has &#13;
a &#13;
strong impact on &#13;
students' &#13;
learning &#13;
processes. &#13;
The &#13;
abandonment &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
"school &#13;
routine", &#13;
the &#13;
fewer school &#13;
days, &#13;
the &#13;
impossibility &#13;
to consolidate &#13;
and &#13;
correct &#13;
learning, &#13;
the &#13;
tension &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
relationship &#13;
of &#13;
schools &#13;
with &#13;
families, &#13;
are &#13;
all &#13;
factors &#13;
that &#13;
seriously affect &#13;
schooling &#13;
attainments. The &#13;
responses &#13;
to &#13;
these &#13;
situations &#13;
has &#13;
led &#13;
some &#13;
school &#13;
systems &#13;
to &#13;
lower &#13;
academic &#13;
requirements &#13;
by &#13;
promoting &#13;
students &#13;
who &#13;
have &#13;
not &#13;
reached &#13;
the &#13;
minimum level &#13;
for &#13;
each &#13;
grade/ &#13;
year. &#13;

capabilities &#13;
to &#13;
innovate &#13;
and &#13;
coordinate &#13;
responses. &#13;
Nevertheless, &#13;
recognizing &#13;
the &#13;
seriousness &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
social situation, &#13;
the &#13;
government &#13;
has &#13;
moved &#13;
decisively &#13;
to &#13;
expand &#13;
key &#13;
safety &#13;
net &#13;
programs, &#13;
including &#13;
the &#13;
Heads &#13;
of &#13;
Household &#13;
program, &#13;
prioritizing &#13;
spending &#13;
on &#13;
them &#13;
and &#13;
consolidating social &#13;
programs around &#13;
a &#13;
smaller &#13;
number &#13;
of &#13;
key &#13;
initiatives. &#13;
In &#13;
addition, &#13;
the &#13;
recent &#13;
creation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
National &#13;
Coordination &#13;
Council &#13;
for &#13;
Social &#13;
Policies &#13;
constitutes &#13;
an &#13;
important &#13;
step &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
direction &#13;
of &#13;
improving &#13;
the &#13;
effectiveness &#13;
of &#13;
social &#13;
policies &#13;
as &#13;
it &#13;
allows &#13;
for &#13;
better &#13;
coordination &#13;
among &#13;
the &#13;
various &#13;
actors &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
national &#13;
level &#13;
and &#13;
between &#13;
different jurisdictions. &#13;
16. &#13;
To &#13;
meet &#13;
the &#13;
challenge &#13;
of &#13;
a &#13;
deteriorating social &#13;
environment, &#13;
the &#13;
government &#13;
has &#13;
launched &#13;
a &#13;
Social &#13;
Emergency &#13;
Program. &#13;
The &#13;
Bank, &#13;
as &#13;
well &#13;
as &#13;
the &#13;
IDB, &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
actively &#13;
supporting &#13;
this &#13;
program &#13;
with &#13;
an &#13;
initial &#13;
reallocation &#13;
of &#13;
US$105.9 &#13;
million &#13;
from &#13;
ongoing &#13;
health &#13;
and &#13;
education &#13;
operations, &#13;
followed &#13;
by &#13;
recent &#13;
Board &#13;
approval &#13;
(October &#13;
15, &#13;
2002) &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
reformulation &#13;
of &#13;
other &#13;
ongoing Bank &#13;
investment loans &#13;
to provide &#13;
a &#13;
further &#13;
US$141 &#13;
million &#13;
to &#13;
cover &#13;
emergency &#13;
needs &#13;
for &#13;
2003. &#13;
Further &#13;
support &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
social &#13;
emergency &#13;
program &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
Bank &#13;
includes &#13;
the &#13;

- &#13;
Implementation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Program &#13;
and &#13;
Proposed &#13;
Restructuring &#13;
17. &#13;
Cordoba&#146;s &#13;
reform &#13;
program &#13;
was &#13;
designed &#13;
to improve &#13;
its &#13;
competitive position &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
global &#13;
economy &#13;
and &#13;
lay &#13;
the &#13;
basis &#13;
for &#13;
sustained &#13;
growth through &#13;
an &#13;
ambitious program &#13;
to stabilize &#13;
government &#13;
finances, &#13;
improve &#13;
public &#13;
services, and &#13;
strengthen &#13;
human &#13;
capital &#13;
formation. &#13;
The &#13;
vision &#13;
is &#13;
to &#13;
create &#13;
a &#13;
model &#13;
provincial &#13;
administration &#13;
by &#13;
redefining &#13;
the &#13;
state-reducing &#13;
the &#13;
size &#13;
and &#13;
tax burden &#13;
of &#13;
government, &#13;
redirecting &#13;
its &#13;
efforts &#13;
more &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
social &#13;
sectors, &#13;
and &#13;
improving &#13;
the &#13;
efficiency &#13;
and &#13;
transparency &#13;
of &#13;
its &#13;
services &#13;
to &#13;
citizens. &#13;
The &#13;
program, &#13;
a &#13;
combination &#13;
of &#13;
first &#13;
and second &#13;
generation reforms, &#13;
has &#13;
three &#13;
main &#13;
components: &#13;
(i) &#13;
strengthening &#13;
public &#13;
finances &#13;
(including &#13;
privatization &#13;
or concessioning &#13;
of &#13;
several &#13;
state &#13;
enterprises, &#13;
tax &#13;
reduction &#13;
accompanied &#13;
by &#13;
strengthened &#13;
tax &#13;
administration, pension reform, &#13;
a &#13;
clean &#13;
up &#13;
of &#13;
municipal &#13;
finances, &#13;
and &#13;
debt &#13;
reduction): &#13;
(ii) &#13;
modernizing &#13;
public &#13;
administration (including &#13;
reforms &#13;
in &#13;
financial &#13;
management, &#13;
civil &#13;
service, &#13;
and &#13;
business &#13;
processes &#13;
and &#13;
organizational &#13;
structure); &#13;
and &#13;
(iii) &#13;
social &#13;
sector &#13;
reform &#13;
(health, &#13;
education, &#13;
and &#13;
social protection). &#13;
As &#13;
indicated &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
Letter &#13;
of &#13;
Provincial &#13;
Reform &#13;
in &#13;
Annex &#13;
A &#13;
(the &#13;
Revised &#13;
Program), &#13;
the &#13;
Provincial &#13;
government &#13;
remains &#13;
committed to &#13;
a &#13;
revised &#13;
reform &#13;
program &#13;
and &#13;
has &#13;
made &#13;
major efforts &#13;
to &#13;
advance &#13;
it. &#13;
18. &#13;
In &#13;
support &#13;
of &#13;
Cordoba&#146;s &#13;
program &#13;
the &#13;
Board &#13;
approved &#13;
in &#13;
November &#13;
2000 &#13;
a &#13;
$303 &#13;
million &#13;
Provincial  Reform &#13;
Loan &#13;
(PRL). &#13;
The &#13;
Loan &#13;
Agreement &#13;
became &#13;
effective &#13;
on &#13;
August &#13;
2, &#13;
2001. &#13;
The &#13;
first &#13;
of &#13;
three &#13;
equal &#13;
tranches &#13;
was &#13;
disbursed &#13;
upon &#13;
effectiveness.  The &#13;
second &#13;
tranche &#13;
(called &#13;
the &#13;
&#147;floating&#148; &#13;
tranche) &#13;
was &#13;
linked to &#13;
sale &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Province&#146;s &#13;
bank &#13;
and &#13;
electricity &#13;
company. &#13;
The &#13;
final &#13;
third &#13;
tranche &#13;
was &#13;
comprehensive &#13;
and &#13;
tied to &#13;
a &#13;
wide &#13;
variety &#13;
of &#13;
public &#13;
finance, &#13;
public &#13;
administration, &#13;
and &#13;
social &#13;
sector &#13;
reforms. &#13;
In &#13;
the &#13;
event, &#13;
disbursements &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
last &#13;
two &#13;
tranches &#13;
were &#13;
interrupted &#13;
due &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
crisis &#13;
in &#13;
Argentina, collapse &#13;
in &#13;
investor &#13;
interest &#13;
in &#13;
purchasing &#13;
public &#13;
enterprises, &#13;
and &#13;
a &#13;
severe &#13;
disruption &#13;
in &#13;
provincial fiscal &#13;
results. &#13;
As &#13;
the &#13;
loan&#146;s &#13;
overall &#13;
objectives &#13;
remain &#13;
valid &#13;
and &#13;
8 &#13;
Page  11&#13;
feasible, &#13;
if &#13;
on &#13;
a &#13;
different &#13;
timeframe, &#13;
it &#13;
is &#13;
therefore &#13;
proposed &#13;
to &#13;
restructure &#13;
the &#13;
loan to &#13;
better &#13;
reflect &#13;
current &#13;
circumstances &#13;
and &#13;
program &#13;
advances. &#13;
19. &#13;
The &#13;
proposed &#13;
amendments &#13;
would &#13;
include &#13;
two &#13;
waivers &#13;
and  amendments &#13;
to &#13;
specific &#13;
conditions &#13;
as &#13;
well &#13;
as &#13;
a &#13;
restructuring &#13;
of &#13;
tranches. &#13;
The &#13;
floating &#13;
tranche &#13;
would &#13;
be &#13;
amended &#13;
and &#13;
renamed &#13;
as &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
tranche, and &#13;
the &#13;
original &#13;
final &#13;
$100 &#13;
million &#13;
tranche &#13;
would &#13;
be &#13;
split &#13;
in &#13;
two. &#13;
A &#13;
new &#13;
third &#13;
tranche &#13;
of &#13;
$25 &#13;
million &#13;
would &#13;
include &#13;
those &#13;
conditions &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
original &#13;
final &#13;
tranche &#13;
that &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
met, &#13;
and &#13;
thus &#13;
would &#13;
be &#13;
eligible &#13;
for &#13;
disbursement. &#13;
The &#13;
fourth &#13;
tranche &#13;
of &#13;
$75 &#13;
million &#13;
would &#13;
include &#13;
those  targets, &#13;
some &#13;
amended, &#13;
still &#13;
under &#13;
implementation. &#13;
This &#13;
proposed &#13;
restructuring &#13;
would &#13;
take &#13;
into &#13;
account &#13;
the  balance &#13;
of &#13;
payments  circumstances &#13;
of &#13;
Argentina, &#13;
conform &#13;
the &#13;
revised &#13;
program &#13;
to &#13;
current &#13;
economic &#13;
circumstances, &#13;
and &#13;
give  credit &#13;
for &#13;
program &#13;
advances &#13;
already achieved. &#13;
The &#13;
Province &#13;
has &#13;
complied &#13;
with &#13;
proposed &#13;
second and &#13;
third &#13;
tranche &#13;
conditions. &#13;
To &#13;
summarize, &#13;
the &#13;
new structure &#13;
would &#13;
be &#13;
as &#13;
follows: &#13;
Second &#13;
tranche: &#13;
$100 &#13;
million; &#13;
amended &#13;
conditions &#13;
relating to &#13;
adherence &#13;
to &#13;
fiscal &#13;
pact &#13;
and &#13;
restructuring &#13;
programs &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
provincial &#13;
bank &#13;
and &#13;
electricity &#13;
company, &#13;
plus &#13;
social protection &#13;
funding; &#13;
eligible for &#13;
immediate &#13;
disbursement. &#13;
Third &#13;
tranche: &#13;
$25 &#13;
million;  original &#13;
targets &#13;
related &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
areas &#13;
of &#13;

administration, &#13;
and &#13;
social &#13;
sector &#13;

that &#13;
have been &#13;

eligible for &#13;
immediate &#13;
disbursement. &#13;
Fourth &#13;
tranche: &#13;
$75 &#13;
million; &#13;
original &#13;
or &#13;

The &#13;
status &#13;
of &#13;
program &#13;
implementation &#13;
in &#13;
major &#13;
component &#13;
areas &#13;
is &#13;
described &#13;
below. &#13;
The &#13;
original &#13;
and &#13;
proposed &#13;
waived &#13;
and  amended &#13;
conditions comprising &#13;
the &#13;
reformulated &#13;
tranches &#13;
are &#13;
presented &#13;
in &#13;
detail &#13;
in &#13;
Annex &#13;
B. &#13;
A &#13;
condition &#13;
of &#13;
disbursement &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
second and &#13;
third &#13;
tranches &#13;
is &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
macro &#13;
policy &#13;
framework &#13;
is &#13;
satisfactory &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
Bank &#13;
and &#13;
that &#13;
the &#13;
Bank &#13;
is &#13;
satisfied &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
progress &#13;
achieved &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
Province &#13;
in &#13;
carrying &#13;
out &#13;
the &#13;
revised &#13;
program. &#13;
With &#13;
regard &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
macro situation, &#13;
taking &#13;
into &#13;
account &#13;
the &#13;
results &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
first &#13;
review &#13;
of Argentina's &#13;
arrangement &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
IMF &#13;
just &#13;
completed &#13;
on &#13;
March &#13;
19, &#13;
2003, &#13;
on &#13;
balance macroeconomic &#13;
policies &#13;
under &#13;
the &#13;
current &#13;
transitional &#13;
program &#13;
appear &#13;
overall &#13;
adequate, &#13;
even &#13;
while &#13;
there &#13;
remain &#13;
substantial &#13;
uncertainties &#13;
and &#13;
challenges &#13;
as &#13;
well &#13;
as &#13;
major &#13;
risks. &#13;
As &#13;
detailed &#13;
below &#13;
and &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
Letter &#13;
of &#13;
Provincial &#13;
Reform &#13;
progress &#13;
in &#13;
carrying &#13;
out &#13;
the &#13;
revised &#13;
program &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
Province &#13;
is &#13;
satisfactory. &#13;
Strengthening &#13;
Public Finance &#13;

Macro-fiscal. &#13;
There &#13;
are &#13;
three &#13;
main &#13;
provincial &#13;
macro-fiscal &#13;
areas &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
current &#13;
reform &#13;
program &#13;
of &#13;
Cordoba &#13;
that &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
affected &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
changes &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
context: &#13;
current &#13;
surplus, &#13;
fiscal &#13;
balance, and &#13;
debt stock. &#13;
During &#13;
the &#13;
first &#13;
half &#13;
of &#13;
2001 &#13;
fiscal &#13;
targets were &#13;
met, &#13;
but &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
semester &#13;
national &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
and &#13;
fiscal &#13;
performance &#13;
declined &#13;
sharply, &#13;
noticeably &#13;
impacting &#13;
the &#13;
Province. &#13;
Macro-fiscal &#13;
targets &#13;
were &#13;
not &#13;
met, &#13;
and &#13;
in &#13;
light &#13;
of &#13;
emergency &#13;
spending &#13;
needs &#13;
and &#13;
to &#13;
prevent &#13;
a &#13;
further &#13;
collapse &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
economy, &#13;
the &#13;
Province &#13;
issued &#13;
bonds (quasi money) &#13;
equivalent &#13;
to &#13;
A$196 &#13;
million &#13;
in &#13;
9 &#13;
Page  12&#13;
2001 &#13;
and &#13;
a &#13;
further &#13;
A$ &#13;
600 &#13;
million &#13;
in &#13;
early &#13;
2002. &#13;
The &#13;
Province &#13;
points to &#13;
the &#13;
sharp &#13;
deterioration &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
national fiscal &#13;
and &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
situation &#13;
as &#13;
the &#13;
primary &#13;
cause &#13;
for &#13;
these &#13;
results. &#13;
Specific &#13;
problems &#13;
included &#13;
a &#13;
fall &#13;
in &#13;
revenues &#13;
due &#13;
to &#13;
an &#13;
economic &#13;
contraction &#13;
more &#13;
rapid &#13;
than &#13;
any &#13;
possible &#13;
offsetting fiscal &#13;
response, &#13;
interruptions &#13;
and &#13;
unpredictability &#13;
in &#13;
federal &#13;
revenue &#13;
sharing &#13;
aggravating &#13;
the &#13;
downward &#13;
trend, &#13;
urgent &#13;
emergency &#13;
spending &#13;
to &#13;
meet &#13;
ballooning &#13;
social &#13;
needs &#13;
and &#13;
municipal &#13;
crises, and &#13;
continued &#13;
high &#13;
debt &#13;
service &#13;
payments &#13;
as &#13;
planned &#13;
privatizations failed &#13;
to &#13;
materialize &#13;
and &#13;
interest &#13;
rates &#13;
soared. &#13;
Between &#13;
2001 &#13;
and &#13;
2002 &#13;
the &#13;
number &#13;
of &#13;
Cordobans &#13;
below &#13;
the &#13;
extreme &#13;
poverty &#13;
line &#13;
more &#13;
than &#13;
doubled &#13;
to &#13;
28 &#13;
percent &#13;
and those &#13;
below &#13;
the &#13;
poverty &#13;
line &#13;
rose &#13;
from &#13;
36 &#13;
to &#13;
59 &#13;
percent &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
estimated &#13;
unemployment &#13;
rate &#13;
rose &#13;
to  nearly &#13;
20  percent. &#13;
Cordoba, &#13;
however, &#13;
took &#13;
measures &#13;
to &#13;
redress &#13;
the &#13;
situation &#13;
by &#13;
strengthening &#13;
its &#13;
own &#13;
tax &#13;
collection, continuing &#13;
the &#13;
freeze &#13;
on nominal &#13;
salaries &#13;
of &#13;
employees, &#13;
reducing &#13;
salaries &#13;
of &#13;
high &#13;
officials, cutting capital &#13;
investments, &#13;
merging &#13;
government &#13;
agencies, &#13;
and &#13;
eliminating &#13;
the &#13;
upper  house &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
legislature. &#13;
In &#13;
July &#13;
2002, &#13;
it &#13;
signed &#13;
a &#13;
fiscal &#13;
pact &#13;
(Convenio &#13;
Bilateral &#13;
- &#13;
Programa &#13;
de &#13;
Financiamiento &#13;
Ordenado &#13;
de &#13;

with &#13;
the &#13;
federal &#13;
government &#13;
which &#13;
called for, &#13;
among other things, &#13;
a &#13;
50 &#13;
percent &#13;
reduction &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
2002 &#13;
deficit from &#13;
its &#13;
2001 level. &#13;
The &#13;
Province &#13;
signed &#13;
on February &#13;
17, &#13;
2003 &#13;
a &#13;
fiscal &#13;
pact &#13;
for &#13;
2003 &#13;
which &#13;
essentially &#13;
posits &#13;
an &#13;
overall &#13;
balanced budget, &#13;
with &#13;
specific quarterly &#13;
targets. &#13;
These &#13;
fiscal &#13;
pacts, &#13;
a &#13;
pillar &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
national stabilization &#13;

Privatization &#13;

Cordoba &#13;
sought &#13;
to &#13;
publicly &#13;
tender &#13;
its &#13;
electric &#13;

as &#13;
well &#13;
as &#13;
its &#13;

A &#13;
privatization &#13;

satisfactory &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
Bank &#13;
was &#13;
approved &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
Legislature, &#13;
a &#13;
power &#13;

by &#13;
international &#13;
investment &#13;
banking &#13;
and &#13;

secured, &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
process &#13;
of &#13;
developing &#13;
international investor &#13;
interest &#13;
advanced &#13;
well &#13;
during &#13;
2000 &#13;
and &#13;
early &#13;
2001. &#13;
The &#13;
sharp &#13;
and &#13;
unanticipated &#13;
fall &#13;
in &#13;
market &#13;
confidence &#13;
in &#13;
mid &#13;
2001, &#13;
however, &#13;
has &#13;
forced &#13;
an &#13;
adjustment &#13;
in &#13;
this &#13;
element &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
reform &#13;
program. &#13;
While &#13;
a &#13;
winning &#13;
bidder &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
provincial &#13;
bank &#13;
was &#13;
selected, &#13;
a &#13;

Nevertheless, &#13;
the &#13;
Province &#13;
remains &#13;
committed to &#13;
its &#13;
fundamental goal &#13;
of &#13;
increasing &#13;
the &#13;
role &#13;
of &#13;
private  capital &#13;
in &#13;
these &#13;
sectors. &#13;
BPC &#13;
is &#13;
now &#13;
under &#13;
new &#13;
management (one &#13;
with &#13;
extensive &#13;
experience &#13;
in &#13;
private &#13;
sector &#13;
banking) &#13;
and &#13;
it &#13;
is &#13;
seeking &#13;
to &#13;
stabilize &#13;
its &#13;
finances &#13;
and &#13;
improve &#13;
its &#13;
performance &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
aim &#13;
of &#13;
increasing &#13;
its &#13;
marketability  pending &#13;
improvement &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
investment &#13;
climate. &#13;
The &#13;
Province &#13;
is &#13;
also &#13;
seeking &#13;
to &#13;
improve &#13;
the &#13;
efficiency &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;

the &#13;
sector. &#13;

specific &#13;
conditions &#13;
and &#13;
tranching &#13;
for &#13;
these &#13;
two &#13;
entities &#13;
would &#13;
be &#13;
amended &#13;
as &#13;

In &#13;
the &#13;
area &#13;
of &#13;
tax administration &#13;
nearly &#13;
all &#13;
programs &#13;
have &#13;
been &#13;
implemented. &#13;
Despite &#13;
these &#13;
reforms, however, &#13;
overall collection &#13;
of &#13;
provincial &#13;
revenue &#13;
has &#13;
fallen &#13;
below &#13;
the &#13;
original &#13;
targets, &#13;
which &#13;
is &#13;
not surprising given &#13;
the &#13;
severe &#13;
recession.  The &#13;
Province&#146;s &#13;
program &#13;
of &#13;
tax &#13;
audit &#13;
was &#13;
undermined &#13;
in &#13;
2001 &#13;
and &#13;
early &#13;
2002 &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
crisis &#13;
which &#13;
impacted &#13;
both &#13;
the &#13;
climate &#13;
for &#13;
conducting &#13;
field &#13;
audits &#13;
as &#13;
well &#13;
as &#13;
the &#13;
availability &#13;
of &#13;
budget &#13;
resources. &#13;
Since &#13;
mid &#13;
2002 &#13;
the &#13;
Province &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
able &#13;
to &#13;
undertake &#13;
a &#13;
concerted &#13;
effort &#13;
to &#13;
improve &#13;
tax &#13;
auditing, &#13;
and &#13;
overall &#13;
the &#13;
results &#13;
of &#13;
its &#13;
tax &#13;
effort &#13;
have exceeded &#13;
that &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
national &#13;
government. &#13;
Although &#13;
an &#13;
IDB &#13;
project to &#13;
support &#13;
an &#13;
ambitious program &#13;
to &#13;
strengthen &#13;
municipal &#13;
finances &#13;
was &#13;
cancelled &#13;
in &#13;
part &#13;
due &#13;
to &#13;
severe &#13;
constraints &#13;
on &#13;
counterpart &#13;
funds, &#13;
the &#13;
government instead &#13;
is &#13;
implementing &#13;
a &#13;
scaled &#13;
down program &#13;
of &#13;
self-financed &#13;
technical &#13;
assistance and &#13;

to &#13;

The &#13;
combined &#13;
fiscal &#13;
and &#13;
social &#13;
crisis &#13;
hitting &#13;
Cordoba &#13;
has &#13;
unsurprisingly &#13;
affected &#13;
its &#13;
social &#13;
sector &#13;
reform &#13;
program. &#13;
The &#13;
targets &#13;
for &#13;
maintaining &#13;
(as &#13;
a &#13;
minimum) &#13;
the &#13;
level &#13;
and &#13;
flow &#13;
of &#13;
resources &#13;
for &#13;
social protection &#13;
have been and &#13;
continue &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
exceeded, &#13;
the &#13;
goal &#13;
set &#13;
for &#13;
registering &#13;
beneficiaries &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
fully &#13;
met, &#13;
and &#13;
an &#13;
assessment &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Province&#146;s &#13;
basket &#13;
of &#13;
social protection &#13;
programs completed. &#13;
The &#13;
strengthening &#13;

in &#13;
response &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
social &#13;
and &#13;
economic &#13;
crisis &#13;
during &#13;
2002 &#13;
was &#13;
led &#13;
and &#13;
financed &#13;
largely &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
national &#13;
government. &#13;
This &#13;
included &#13;
the &#13;
establishment &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Heads &#13;
of &#13;
Household &#13;
Program, &#13;
a &#13;
large-scale &#13;
effort &#13;
to provide social &#13;
assistance &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
large &#13;
number &#13;
of &#13;
families &#13;
at &#13;
risk. &#13;
This &#13;
is &#13;
a &#13;
workfare program &#13;
directed &#13;
at &#13;
households &#13;
containing children &#13;
under &#13;
the &#13;
age &#13;
of &#13;
18 &#13;
and whose &#13;
head &#13;
is &#13;
unemployed. &#13;
In &#13;
exchange &#13;
for &#13;
a &#13;
transfer &#13;
of &#13;
150 &#13;
Argentine &#13;
pesodmonth, &#13;
the &#13;
participants &#13;
must &#13;
participate &#13;
in &#13;
workfare or &#13;
eligible training &#13;
activities. &#13;
As &#13;
of &#13;
early &#13;
2002, &#13;
the &#13;
Program &#13;
was &#13;
paying nearly &#13;
2 &#13;
million &#13;
beneficiaries &#13;
throughout &#13;
the &#13;
country. &#13;
The &#13;
national &#13;
government &#13;
also increased &#13;
spending &#13;
on &#13;
feeding &#13;
programs. &#13;
This &#13;
included &#13;
both block &#13;
grants &#13;
to &#13;
provinces, &#13;
as &#13;
well &#13;
as &#13;
expanded &#13;
funding for &#13;
school  feeding &#13;
and &#13;
for &#13;
soup &#13;
kitchens, &#13;
mainly &#13;
serving &#13;
children, &#13;
operated &#13;
by &#13;
non- &#13;
governmental &#13;

groups. &#13;
Both &#13;
the &#13;
Heads &#13;
of &#13;
Household &#13;
Program &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
feeding  programs &#13;
operated &#13;
by &#13;
non-governmental &#13;
groups &#13;
are &#13;
being &#13;
supported &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
World &#13;

necessarily &#13;
led &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;

Reducing &#13;

The &#13;

benefit &#13;
would &#13;
be &#13;
in &#13;
maintaining &#13;
and &#13;
advancing &#13;
reforms &#13;
in &#13;
public &#13;
finances, &#13;
public &#13;
administration, &#13;
as &#13;
well &#13;
as &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
social &#13;
sectors, &#13;
where &#13;
90 &#13;
percent &#13;
of &#13;
health &#13;
and &#13;
basic education &#13;
are &#13;
the &#13;
responsibility &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Cordoba government. &#13;
It &#13;
would &#13;
support &#13;
the &#13;
government&#146;s &#13;
efforts to &#13;
adapt &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
changed &#13;
macro-economic &#13;
circumstances &#13;
and advance &#13;
toward &#13;
the &#13;
goal &#13;
of &#13;
privatizing &#13;
the &#13;
provincial &#13;
bank &#13;
and &#13;
increasing private &#13;
sector &#13;
funding &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
electricity &#13;
company &#13;
despite &#13;
the &#13;
changed &#13;
environment &#13;
by &#13;
strengthening &#13;
their &#13;
operations &#13;
pending improvement &#13;
in &#13;
market &#13;
conditions. &#13;
The &#13;
reforms &#13;
under &#13;
implementation &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
social &#13;
sectors &#13;
represent &#13;
important &#13;
steps &#13;
toward &#13;
strengthening &#13;
the &#13;
efficiency &#13;
and &#13;
effectiveness &#13;
of &#13;
government &#13;
interventions &#13;
in &#13;
those &#13;
areas &#13;
at &#13;
a &#13;
crucial &#13;
time. &#13;
Beyond &#13;
Cordoba, &#13;
this &#13;
program &#13;
will &#13;
contribute &#13;
to &#13;
consolidate &#13;
the &#13;
incipient &#13;
economic &#13;
recovery &#13;
and &#13;
enhance &#13;
the &#13;
conditions &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
continuation &#13;
of &#13;
a &#13;
longer-term &#13;
reform &#13;
program &#13;
in &#13;
Argentina. &#13;
30. &#13;
Even &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
proposed &#13;
amendment &#13;
the &#13;
Province may &#13;
fail &#13;
to &#13;
meet &#13;
its &#13;
reform &#13;
goals, &#13;
either &#13;
because &#13;
of &#13;
a &#13;
lack &#13;
of &#13;
commitment &#13;
or &#13;
a &#13;
further &#13;
deterioration &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
and &#13;
social &#13;
environment. &#13;
A &#13;
related &#13;
risk &#13;
is &#13;
that, &#13;
while &#13;
a &#13;
provincial &#13;
government &#13;
is &#13;
able &#13;
to &#13;
meet &#13;
its &#13;
reform &#13;
commitments, &#13;
the &#13;
Federal &#13;
government &#13;
may &#13;
fail &#13;
to &#13;
maintain &#13;
a &#13;
satisfactory  macroeconomic &#13;
framework &#13;
or &#13;
subsequently  deviates &#13;
from &#13;
an &#13;
agreed &#13;
program. &#13;
Third, &#13;
uncertainties related &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
upcoming presidential &#13;
as &#13;
well &#13;
as &#13;
Provincial &#13;
elections &#13;
pose &#13;
a &#13;
risk &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
implementation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
program. &#13;
Beyond &#13;
these &#13;
risks, &#13;
a &#13;
continued &#13;
economic &#13;
slow &#13;
down, &#13;
including &#13;
the &#13;
impact &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
general &#13;
world &#13;
economy &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
war &#13;
in &#13;
Iraq, &#13;
would &#13;
also present &#13;
serious &#13;
risks &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
fragile &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
situation. &#13;
Mitigating &#13;
these &#13;
risks &#13;
is &#13;
the &#13;
commitment &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
including &#13;
Cordoba &#13;
to &#13;
reduce &#13;
the &#13;
overall &#13;
provincial  deficit &#13;
and &#13;
produce &#13;
sustained &#13;
primary &#13;
surpluses. &#13;
The &#13;
much &#13;
better &#13;
than &#13;
anticipated performance &#13;
in &#13;
2002 &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
provinces &#13;
and &#13;
their &#13;
commitment &#13;
to &#13;
implement &#13;
the &#13;
2003 &#13;
targets &#13;
are &#13;
hopeful &#13;
signs &#13;
that &#13;
they &#13;
will &#13;
carry out &#13;
the &#13;
2003 &#13;
agreements. &#13;
There &#13;
are &#13;
several &#13;
substantial &#13;
risks. &#13;

President &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
World &#13;
Bank &#13;
Dear &#13;
Mr. &#13;
Wolfensohn: &#13;
1. &#13;
This letter &#13;
provides &#13;
a &#13;
summary &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
political, &#13;
economic, &#13;
and &#13;
social &#13;
situation &#13;
that &#13;
has &#13;
affected &#13;
our  province &#13;
over &#13;
the &#13;
last &#13;
two &#13;
years, &#13;
the &#13;
progress &#13;
achieved &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
implementation &#13;
of &#13;
our &#13;
reform &#13;
program  supported &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
Cordoba &#13;
Provincial &#13;
Reform &#13;
Loan, &#13;
and &#13;
our commitment &#13;
to &#13;
carry &#13;
out &#13;
the &#13;
revised &#13;
reform &#13;
Program &#13;
as &#13;
described &#13;
below. &#13;
2. &#13;
On &#13;
assuming &#13;
office &#13;
as &#13;
Governor &#13;
of &#13;
Cordoba &#13;
on &#13;
July &#13;
12, &#13;
1999, &#13;
I &#13;
did &#13;
so &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
conviction &#13;
that &#13;
major &#13;
changes &#13;
would &#13;
be &#13;
necessary &#13;
in &#13;
order &#13;
to &#13;
modernize &#13;
the &#13;
province &#13;
and &#13;
lay &#13;
the &#13;
groundwork &#13;
for &#13;
sustainable &#13;
economic &#13;
growth &#13;
and social development. &#13;
The &#13;
most &#13;
important component &#13;
of &#13;
this &#13;
program &#13;
was &#13;
to &#13;
change &#13;
relations &#13;
between &#13;
citizens &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
state, &#13;
and &#13;
to &#13;
use &#13;
this &#13;
new relationship &#13;
as &#13;
the catalyst &#13;
for &#13;
a &#13;
far-reaching &#13;
modernization &#13;
process &#13;
of &#13;
institutions &#13;
that &#13;
would &#13;
pave &#13;
the &#13;
way &#13;
for &#13;
better &#13;
services &#13;
to &#13;
be provided &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
people. &#13;
3. &#13;
Today, &#13;
after &#13;
three &#13;
and a &#13;
half &#13;
years, &#13;
I &#13;
can &#13;
say &#13;
that &#13;
it &#13;
was &#13;
possible &#13;
to &#13;
implement &#13;
a &#13;
number &#13;
of &#13;
important &#13;
changes &#13;
which &#13;
will, without &#13;
a &#13;
doubt, establish &#13;
the &#13;
foundation &#13;
for &#13;
a &#13;
better &#13;
future &#13;
for &#13;
the province. &#13;
However, &#13;
I &#13;
must &#13;
also &#13;
say &#13;
that &#13;
as &#13;
a &#13;
result &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
major &#13;
political, &#13;
social,  and economic &#13;
problems that &#13;
Argentina &#13;
has &#13;
experienced, &#13;
fulfillment &#13;
of &#13;
our objectives &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
delayed. &#13;
Despite &#13;
this, &#13;
we &#13;
never &#13;
strayed &#13;
from &#13;
the course &#13;
that &#13;
we &#13;
charted; we &#13;
merely &#13;
suffered &#13;
setbacks &#13;
that &#13;
we &#13;
hope &#13;
to &#13;
overcome &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
months &#13;
ahead. &#13;
The &#13;
Crisis &#13;
4. &#13;
As &#13;
you &#13;
know &#13;
1998 &#13;
marked &#13;
the &#13;
beginning &#13;
of &#13;
one &#13;
the &#13;
most &#13;
protracted &#13;
and &#13;
severe &#13;
economic &#13;
crises &#13;
in &#13;
Argentina's &#13;
history, and &#13;
this &#13;
crisis &#13;
worsened &#13;
in &#13;
2001. &#13;
A &#13;
number &#13;
of &#13;
external &#13;
shocks &#13;
had &#13;
a &#13;
very &#13;
negative &#13;
impact &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
productive &#13;
activities &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
country. &#13;
Some &#13;
of &#13;
these &#13;
external &#13;
shocks, &#13;
such &#13;
as &#13;
the &#13;
devaluation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Brazilian &#13;
currency, &#13;
took &#13;
a &#13;
particularly &#13;
heavy &#13;
toll &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
traditional &#13;
exports &#13;
of &#13;
Cordoba, &#13;
and &#13;
in &#13;
general, &#13;
on &#13;
its &#13;
most &#13;
important &#13;
productive &#13;
activities. &#13;
5. &#13;
A &#13;
host &#13;
of &#13;
serious and &#13;
unanticipated &#13;
problems &#13;
also &#13;
emerged &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
political &#13;
and &#13;
institutional &#13;
spheres. &#13;
Many &#13;
misguided &#13;
decisions &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
national &#13;
level &#13;
led &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
recession &#13;
that many &#13;
thought &#13;
would &#13;
prove &#13;
fleeting, &#13;
but &#13;
which &#13;
turned &#13;
out to &#13;
be &#13;
truly &#13;
disastrous &#13;
from &#13;
18 &#13;
Page  22&#13;
an &#13;
economic, &#13;
social, &#13;
and &#13;
institutional &#13;
standpoint, &#13;
amounting &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
veritable  fiasco. &#13;
Naturally, &#13;
this &#13;
situation &#13;
spawned greater &#13;
ills, &#13;
ranging &#13;
from &#13;
the  chaotic &#13;
cessation &#13;
of &#13;
international &#13;
debt payments &#13;
to &#13;
the free &#13;
fall &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
peso &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
descent &#13;
into &#13;
poverty &#13;
of &#13;
almost &#13;
half &#13;
of &#13;
Argentine &#13;
households. &#13;
6. &#13;
on &#13;
time: &#13;
Due &#13;
to &#13;
these &#13;
developments Cordoba &#13;
was &#13;
unable &#13;
to &#13;
achieve &#13;
a &#13;
number &#13;
of &#13;
our &#13;
goals &#13;
Unanticipated &#13;
revenue shortfalls: &#13;
the &#13;
combination &#13;
of &#13;
falling &#13;
economic &#13;
activity &#13;
and &#13;
disruptions &#13;
in &#13;
federal  revenue &#13;
sharing &#13;
emerged &#13;
during &#13;
the &#13;
2001  fiscal &#13;
year, &#13;
particularly &#13;
during &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
semester. &#13;
A &#13;
dearth &#13;
of &#13;
international &#13;
credit: &#13;
recurring fiscal &#13;
imbalances &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
national &#13;
level &#13;
created &#13;
the &#13;
impression &#13;
among  external  creditors  that &#13;
Argentina &#13;
could  not &#13;
meet &#13;
its &#13;
international &#13;
commitments, &#13;
and &#13;
credit &#13;
became &#13;
increasingly restricted &#13;
until &#13;
it &#13;
was &#13;
reduced &#13;
to &#13;
zero. &#13;
In &#13;
a national &#13;
context, &#13;
this &#13;
made &#13;
it &#13;
impossible &#13;
to &#13;
refinance &#13;
maturing &#13;
debt, &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
attendant &#13;
loss &#13;
of &#13;
reserves. &#13;
Loss &#13;
of &#13;
confidence &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
domestic &#13;
level: &#13;
the &#13;
loss &#13;
of &#13;
reserves, &#13;
which &#13;
pushed &#13;
risk &#13;
indicators &#13;
into &#13;
the &#13;
number &#13;
one &#13;
position &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
global &#13;
level, &#13;
also &#13;
led &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
loss &#13;
of &#13;
confidence &#13;
on &#13;
the part &#13;
of &#13;
savers &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
financial &#13;
system. &#13;
They &#13;
began &#13;
to &#13;
withdraw &#13;
their &#13;
money &#13;
from &#13;
banks, &#13;
initially &#13;
at &#13;
a &#13;
steady &#13;
pace &#13;
and &#13;
later &#13;
in &#13;
droves. &#13;
The &#13;
main &#13;
result &#13;
of &#13;
this &#13;
was &#13;
a record &#13;
rise &#13;
in &#13;
interest &#13;
rates, &#13;
which &#13;
particularly &#13;
affected &#13;
provinces &#13;
such &#13;
as &#13;
Cordoba &#13;
with &#13;
high &#13;
debt &#13;
profile. &#13;
The &#13;
freezing &#13;
of &#13;
deposits, &#13;
default, and devaluation: &#13;
as &#13;
a result &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
two &#13;
events &#13;
described &#13;
above, &#13;
the &#13;
national &#13;
government &#13;
initially &#13;
restricted &#13;
access &#13;
to &#13;
bank &#13;
deposits &#13;
and &#13;
then &#13;
froze &#13;
them, &#13;
in &#13;
order &#13;
to &#13;
avoid &#13;
the collapse &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
financial &#13;
system. &#13;
This &#13;
situation &#13;
was &#13;
compounded &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
default &#13;
on &#13;
external &#13;
debt &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
loss &#13;
of &#13;
convertibility &#13;
of &#13;
our currency. &#13;
7. &#13;
The &#13;
sequence &#13;
of &#13;
events described &#13;
above &#13;
led to &#13;
substantial &#13;
and &#13;
drastic &#13;
change &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
economic &#13;
conditions &#13;
in &#13;
Cordoba Province &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
handling &#13;
of &#13;
public &#13;
finances &#13;
in &#13;
relation to &#13;
initial &#13;
projections. &#13;
The &#13;
first &#13;
noticeable &#13;
effect &#13;
was &#13;
a &#13;
decline &#13;
in &#13;
economic &#13;
activity. &#13;
At &#13;
the &#13;
end &#13;
of &#13;
2001, &#13;
real &#13;
gross &#13;
product &#13;
fell &#13;
by &#13;
5 &#13;
percent &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
national &#13;
level, &#13;
and &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
provincial &#13;
level, &#13;
this &#13;
figure &#13;
was &#13;
even &#13;
higher. &#13;
8. &#13;
This situation &#13;
fell &#13;
far &#13;
short &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
scenarios &#13;
on &#13;
which &#13;
our &#13;
fiscal &#13;
projections &#13;
were &#13;
based; &#13;
i.e., &#13;
a &#13;
2.5 &#13;
percent increase &#13;
in &#13;
GDP. &#13;
This &#13;
immediately &#13;
led &#13;
to &#13;
a decline &#13;
in &#13;
income &#13;
at &#13;
both &#13;
the &#13;
national &#13;
and &#13;
provincial &#13;
levels, &#13;
the &#13;
result &#13;
being &#13;
that  actual &#13;
figures &#13;
were &#13;
well &#13;
below &#13;
original &#13;
projections. &#13;
9. &#13;
On &#13;
the &#13;
expenditure &#13;
side, &#13;
there &#13;
was &#13;
an &#13;
almost &#13;
100 &#13;
percent increase &#13;
in &#13;
interest&#146;s &#13;
payments, &#13;
stemming &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
lack &#13;
of &#13;
liquidity &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
financial &#13;
system, &#13;
which &#13;
prompted &#13;
the &#13;
tripling &#13;
of &#13;
interest &#13;
rates &#13;
between &#13;
the &#13;
first &#13;
half &#13;
and second &#13;
half &#13;
of &#13;
2001. &#13;
Another &#13;
significant &#13;
increase &#13;
was &#13;
seen &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
spending &#13;
for &#13;
personnel, &#13;
goods, &#13;
and &#13;
non &#13;
personnel &#13;
services, &#13;
due &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
increased &#13;
attention &#13;
that &#13;
had &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
paid to &#13;
the &#13;
provision &#13;
of &#13;
services &#13;
by &#13;
19 &#13;
Page  23&#13;
the &#13;
provincial &#13;
public &#13;
sector &#13;
as &#13;
a &#13;
result &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
deteriorating &#13;
social &#13;
situation &#13;
described &#13;
below. &#13;
10. &#13;
One &#13;
significant &#13;
event that &#13;
contributed &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
worse than expected &#13;
situation &#13;
during &#13;
the &#13;
second &#13;
half &#13;
of &#13;
2001 &#13;
linked to &#13;
the &#13;
crisis &#13;
described &#13;
above &#13;
was &#13;
the &#13;
fact that investment &#13;
of &#13;
private capital &#13;
in &#13;
public &#13;
sector companies &#13;
could &#13;
not &#13;
take &#13;
place. &#13;
This &#13;
prevented the &#13;
province &#13;
from &#13;
servicing &#13;
its &#13;
debt &#13;
as &#13;
was &#13;
planned &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
funds &#13;
to be &#13;
obtained &#13;
largely &#13;
from &#13;
the concessioning &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
power company and the &#13;
privatization &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
lottery &#13;
and &#13;
casino &#13;
businesses. &#13;
In &#13;
addition, &#13;
debt &#13;
stocks &#13;
rose &#13;
above &#13;
projected &#13;
levels, &#13;
largely &#13;
because &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
assistance &#13;
that &#13;
had &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
provided to &#13;
the &#13;
Provincial &#13;
Bank, &#13;
which &#13;
we were &#13;
unable &#13;
to &#13;
privatize &#13;
despite &#13;
a &#13;
major &#13;
effort &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
Province. &#13;
11. &#13;
The &#13;
following &#13;
year &#13;
turned &#13;
out &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
extremely &#13;
difficult &#13;
as &#13;
well; &#13;
perhaps &#13;
the &#13;
worst &#13;
in &#13;
the recent &#13;
history &#13;
of &#13;
Argentina. &#13;
Economic &#13;
activity &#13;
fell &#13;
by &#13;
11 &#13;
percent, &#13;
with &#13;
troughs &#13;
in &#13;
such &#13;
areas &#13;
as &#13;
construction &#13;
(32.4%); &#13;
trade &#13;
(22.7%); &#13;
and &#13;
financial intermediation &#13;
(21.5%). &#13;
Activity &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
automotive &#13;
industry  declined &#13;
by &#13;
66 &#13;
percent &#13;
(one &#13;
of &#13;
Cordoba&#146;s &#13;
major &#13;
industries) &#13;
bringing &#13;
production to &#13;
the &#13;
level &#13;
of &#13;
1959. &#13;
This &#13;
had &#13;
a &#13;
serious &#13;
impact &#13;
on &#13;
the &#13;
province, &#13;
where &#13;
unemployment &#13;
reached &#13;
25.3 &#13;
percent &#13;
and, &#13;
if &#13;
we &#13;
include &#13;
underemployed &#13;
persons, &#13;
34.3 &#13;
percent. &#13;
This &#13;
means &#13;
that &#13;
more &#13;
than &#13;
400,000 &#13;
homes &#13;
in &#13;
Cordoba &#13;
experienced serious employment problems. &#13;
In &#13;
terms &#13;
of &#13;
a &#13;
basic basket &#13;
of &#13;
goods, &#13;
inflation &#13;
reached &#13;
73 &#13;
percent, &#13;
which &#13;
means &#13;
that the &#13;
erosion &#13;
of &#13;
salaries &#13;
was great. &#13;
Social &#13;
and &#13;
Fiscal &#13;
Impact &#13;
12. &#13;
This &#13;
crisis &#13;
has &#13;
taken &#13;
a &#13;
heavy &#13;
toll &#13;
on &#13;
society &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
same &#13;
year &#13;
time. &#13;
Consequently, &#13;
despite &#13;
the &#13;
fact &#13;
that &#13;
in &#13;
2002 &#13;
the &#13;
province received $230 &#13;
million &#13;
less &#13;
than &#13;
the &#13;
previous &#13;
year &#13;
from &#13;
the federal &#13;
government, &#13;
the &#13;
provincial &#13;
government &#13;
had &#13;
to &#13;
redouble &#13;
its &#13;
efforts &#13;
to &#13;
provide &#13;
special &#13;
assistance &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
people &#13;
of &#13;
Cordoba. &#13;
For &#13;
example, the number &#13;
of &#13;
visits &#13;
by &#13;
patients &#13;
to &#13;
public &#13;
hospitals &#13;
rose &#13;
by &#13;
one &#13;
million &#13;
in &#13;
our &#13;
province &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
past &#13;
year. &#13;
The &#13;
number &#13;
of &#13;
students &#13;
attending &#13;
public &#13;
schools &#13;
in &#13;
Cordoba &#13;
also &#13;
increased &#13;
as &#13;
parents &#13;
withdrew them &#13;
from &#13;
private &#13;
schools. &#13;
At &#13;
the &#13;
primary &#13;
school level, &#13;
student numbers rose &#13;
by &#13;
15,000, &#13;
and &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
intermediate level, &#13;
by &#13;
14,000. &#13;
In &#13;
the past three &#13;
years, &#13;
enrolment &#13;
at &#13;
the &#13;
intermediate &#13;
level &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
rural &#13;
sectors &#13;
has &#13;
tripled, &#13;
as &#13;
it &#13;
has at &#13;
special &#13;
schools. &#13;
Demand &#13;
for  food &#13;
increased, &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
number &#13;
of &#13;
persons &#13;
receiving &#13;
assistance &#13;
has &#13;
risen &#13;
from &#13;
130,000 &#13;
to &#13;
220,000 &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
past &#13;
twelve &#13;
months. &#13;
Added &#13;
to &#13;
this &#13;
are &#13;
the &#13;
25,000 &#13;
children &#13;
who &#13;
eat &#13;
every  day &#13;
in &#13;
provincial &#13;
cafeterias &#13;
and the &#13;
18,000 &#13;
senior &#13;
citizens &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
210,000 &#13;
youngsters &#13;
who &#13;
receive &#13;
daily &#13;
assistance &#13;
through &#13;
the &#13;
PAICOR &#13;
(Comprehensive &#13;
Assistance &#13;
Program &#13;
of &#13;
Cordoba). &#13;
13. &#13;
In &#13;
the &#13;
midst &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
crisis, &#13;
we &#13;
are &#13;
helping families &#13;
and &#13;
we &#13;
are &#13;
confident &#13;
that &#13;
we &#13;
are &#13;
doing &#13;
so &#13;
properly. &#13;
Beginning &#13;
last &#13;
year, &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
first &#13;
time &#13;
in &#13;
our &#13;
history,  Cordoba &#13;
introduced a single &#13;
plan for &#13;
all &#13;
the &#13;
beneficiaries &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
different &#13;
social &#13;
plans &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
province, &#13;
which &#13;
permits &#13;
greater &#13;
control &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
exercised over social &#13;
assistance &#13;
and &#13;
much &#13;
greater  transparency &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
handling &#13;
of &#13;
that &#13;
assistance. &#13;
Each &#13;
box &#13;
of &#13;
food, &#13;
each &#13;
employment  plan, &#13;
each &#13;
subsidy, &#13;
and &#13;
each &#13;
form &#13;
of &#13;
assistance &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
elderly &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
disabled &#13;
bears &#13;
the &#13;
first &#13;
and last &#13;
names &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
recipient. &#13;

14. &#13;
Faced &#13;
with &#13;
growing &#13;
demand, &#13;
we have &#13;
been &#13;
forced &#13;
to &#13;
reallocate &#13;
resources. &#13;
We &#13;
have made &#13;
the &#13;
decision &#13;
to &#13;
refrain &#13;
from &#13;
increasing &#13;
taxes, &#13;
to &#13;
keep &#13;
schools &#13;
open, &#13;
and &#13;
to &#13;
ensure &#13;
that &#13;
hospitals &#13;
are &#13;
running.  Also, &#13;
we &#13;
are &#13;
not &#13;
exacerbating &#13;
the &#13;
crisis &#13;
by &#13;
cutting &#13;
the &#13;
salaries &#13;
of &#13;
employees &#13;
or &#13;
the &#13;
pension &#13;
of &#13;
retirees. &#13;
Instead, &#13;
we  have  chosen &#13;
to &#13;
lower &#13;
salaries &#13;
for &#13;
political &#13;
positions, &#13;
we  have &#13;
made &#13;
further &#13;
adjustments &#13;
to &#13;
government &#13;
structures, &#13;
we &#13;
have &#13;
eliminated &#13;
secretariats, &#13;
and we &#13;
are &#13;
merging ministries &#13;
and &#13;
agencies, &#13;
all &#13;
with &#13;
the sole &#13;
aim &#13;
of &#13;
ensuring that people &#13;
do &#13;
not &#13;
go &#13;
hungry &#13;
and &#13;
are &#13;
not &#13;
left &#13;
to &#13;
their &#13;
own &#13;
devices &#13;
during &#13;
this &#13;
period. &#13;
15. &#13;
Consequently  our &#13;
deficit &#13;
-based &#13;
on &#13;
federal &#13;
government's &#13;
methodology &#13;
of &#13;
accounting- reached &#13;
A$716 &#13;
million &#13;
in &#13;
2001. &#13;
This &#13;
was &#13;
the context &#13;
in &#13;
which &#13;
we &#13;
issued &#13;
Provincial Debt &#13;
Payment Instruments &#13;
(LECOP &#13;
CORDOBA &#13;
or &#13;
LECOR), &#13;
which &#13;
we &#13;
are &#13;
now &#13;
withdrawing &#13;
from &#13;
circulation &#13;
and expect &#13;
to &#13;
redeem &#13;
fully &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
months &#13;
ahead. &#13;
These &#13;
instruments &#13;
provided &#13;
a &#13;
mechanism &#13;
for &#13;
maintaining &#13;
economic &#13;
activity &#13;
in &#13;
our &#13;
province &#13;
and &#13;
saving &#13;
the &#13;
jobs &#13;
of &#13;
thousands &#13;
of &#13;
families. &#13;
People were able &#13;
to &#13;
continue &#13;
their &#13;
purchases &#13;
and &#13;
to &#13;
be paid, and &#13;
the &#13;
economy &#13;
did &#13;
not &#13;
grind &#13;
to &#13;
a &#13;
complete &#13;
halt. &#13;
During &#13;
2002 &#13;
we &#13;
were able &#13;
to &#13;
reduce &#13;
the &#13;
deficit &#13;
by &#13;
60 &#13;
percent &#13;
and &#13;
eliminate &#13;
dependence &#13;
on &#13;
LECORs. &#13;
For &#13;
2003 &#13;
we &#13;
project &#13;
a balanced &#13;
budget. &#13;
Cordoba's Continued &#13;
Reform &#13;
Effort &#13;
16. &#13;
My &#13;
government &#13;
remains &#13;
committed &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
vision &#13;
of &#13;
a strong &#13;
and &#13;
small &#13;
state &#13;
aimed &#13;
at  necessary &#13;
investments &#13;
in &#13;
human &#13;
capital &#13;
and &#13;
providing &#13;
the &#13;
appropriate &#13;
climate &#13;
for &#13;
savings, &#13;
investment, &#13;
and &#13;
growth. &#13;
Unfortunately &#13;
full &#13;
achievement &#13;
of &#13;
these &#13;
goals &#13;
is &#13;
not &#13;
totally &#13;
in &#13;
our &#13;
hands. &#13;
However we &#13;
will &#13;
do &#13;
our &#13;
part. &#13;
We &#13;
would &#13;
ask &#13;
you &#13;
as &#13;
our partner &#13;
to &#13;
consider amending the &#13;
loan &#13;
agreement &#13;
to &#13;
reflect &#13;
targets &#13;
more &#13;
appropriate &#13;
for &#13;
current &#13;
circumstances. &#13;
17. &#13;
Public &#13;
Finances. &#13;
While &#13;
unable &#13;
to &#13;
meet &#13;
the &#13;
original &#13;
fiscal &#13;
goals &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
program &#13;
due &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
macroeconomic &#13;
deterioration  noted &#13;
above, &#13;
we  have &#13;
complied &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
Programa &#13;
de &#13;
Financiamiento &#13;
Ordenado &#13;
2002, based &#13;
on &#13;

y &#13;
Bases &#13;
de &#13;
un &#13;
Regimen &#13;
de &#13;
Coparticipacion Federal &#13;
and have &#13;
signed &#13;
the &#13;
Programa &#13;
de &#13;
Financiamiento &#13;
Ordenado &#13;
2003. &#13;
Under &#13;
these &#13;
so &#13;
called Fiscal &#13;
Pacts &#13;
we &#13;
sharply reduced our &#13;
deficit &#13;
in &#13;
2002 &#13;
and &#13;
are &#13;
committed to &#13;
a &#13;
balanced &#13;
budget &#13;
in &#13;
2003 &#13;
including &#13;
adherence &#13;
to &#13;
all &#13;
the &#13;
quarterly &#13;
targets &#13;
under &#13;
Pact. &#13;
Our &#13;
program &#13;
of &#13;
improved &#13;
tax &#13;
administration &#13;
is &#13;
registering &#13;
real &#13;
progress &#13;
in &#13;
terms &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
application &#13;
of &#13;
information &#13;
technology, crossing &#13;
of &#13;
data &#13;
bases, &#13;
improved &#13;
coordination &#13;
with &#13;
banks. &#13;
The &#13;
ITAX &#13;
system &#13;
was &#13;
introduced, &#13;
which &#13;
permits &#13;
taxpayers &#13;
to &#13;
issue &#13;
the &#13;
bills &#13;
to &#13;
pay &#13;
taxes &#13;
due &#13;
or to &#13;
make &#13;
installment &#13;
payments &#13;
via &#13;
the &#13;
Internet. &#13;
A &#13;
judicial &#13;
module &#13;
was &#13;
also &#13;
introduced &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
Otax &#13;
system, &#13;
with &#13;
training &#13;
being &#13;
provided &#13;
for &#13;
all &#13;
staff &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
Judicial &#13;
Collection &#13;
Division &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Revenue &#13;
Department. &#13;
In &#13;
addition, &#13;
"small &#13;
sample" operations &#13;
involving &#13;
taxpayers &#13;
and &#13;
comprehensive audits &#13;
by &#13;
specialized &#13;
teams &#13;
took &#13;
place. &#13;
Cooperation &#13;
agreements &#13;
were &#13;
concluded &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
national tax &#13;
agency &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
municipalities. &#13;
The &#13;
roperty &#13;
database &#13;
was &#13;
improved, &#13;
with &#13;
a &#13;
view &#13;
to &#13;
collecting &#13;
taxes &#13;
on &#13;
a &#13;
total &#13;
of &#13;
2,144,425 &#13;
m &#13;
, &#13;
measured &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
field. &#13;
More &#13;
than &#13;
39,000 &#13;
notifications &#13;
were &#13;
sent &#13;
to &#13;
delinquent &#13;
taxpayers &#13;
for &#13;
taxes &#13;
owed &#13;
on &#13;
r &#13;

Page  25&#13;
real &#13;
estate &#13;
and &#13;
gross &#13;
income. &#13;
As &#13;
a result, &#13;
despite &#13;
the &#13;
fall &#13;
in &#13;
overall &#13;
economic &#13;
activity &#13;
our &#13;
relative &#13;
level &#13;
of &#13;
tax &#13;
collection &#13;
is &#13;
running &#13;
higher &#13;
to &#13;
that &#13;
of &#13;
the federal government. &#13;
We &#13;
are &#13;
making &#13;
a concerted &#13;
efforts  to &#13;
expand tax  audits &#13;
during &#13;
2003. &#13;
Improvements &#13;
in &#13;
municipal &#13;
finances &#13;
and &#13;
cadastres &#13;
is &#13;
a &#13;
top &#13;
priority &#13;
as &#13;
well, &#13;
and &#13;
we &#13;
are &#13;
moving to &#13;
replace &#13;
from &#13;
our &#13;
own &#13;
resources, &#13;
technical &#13;
assistance &#13;
to &#13;
selected &#13;
groups &#13;
of &#13;
municipalities &#13;
which &#13;
had &#13;
been &#13;
anticipated &#13;
from &#13;
another &#13;
multilateral institution. &#13;
18. &#13;
In &#13;
the &#13;
area &#13;
of &#13;
public &#13;
agencies &#13;
my &#13;
government &#13;
is &#13;
implementing &#13;
a &#13;
program &#13;
of &#13;
reform &#13;
and &#13;
restructuring &#13;
designed &#13;
to &#13;
strengthen &#13;
the &#13;
management, &#13;
accountability, &#13;
finances, &#13;
and &#13;
services &#13;
of &#13;
both &#13;
the &#13;
Provincial &#13;
Bank &#13;
of &#13;
Cordoba &#13;
(BPC) &#13;
and &#13;
our &#13;
electricity &#13;
company (EPEC). &#13;
For &#13;
BPC &#13;
we have &#13;
changed &#13;
its &#13;
management &#13;
by &#13;
bringing &#13;
in &#13;
experienced &#13;
professionals &#13;
from &#13;
the &#13;
Argentine  private &#13;
banking &#13;
sector, &#13;
submitted &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
Argentine &#13;
Central &#13;
Bank &#13;
(BCRA) &#13;
a &#13;
Plan &#13;
for &#13;
BPC&#146;s &#13;
restructuring, &#13;
initiated &#13;
several &#13;
interim &#13;
measures, &#13;
and &#13;
are &#13;
seeking &#13;
through &#13;
competitive &#13;
bidding &#13;
to &#13;
outsource &#13;
the &#13;
management &#13;
and &#13;
retrieval &#13;
of &#13;
BPC&#146;s &#13;
negatively &#13;
rated &#13;
assets. &#13;
We &#13;
have contracted &#13;
an &#13;
international &#13;
management &#13;
firm &#13;
to &#13;
conduct a comprehensive diagnosis &#13;
of &#13;
BPC &#13;
in &#13;
order &#13;
to &#13;
further &#13;
refine &#13;
the &#13;
Restructuring &#13;
Plan &#13;
presented &#13;
to &#13;
BCRA &#13;
and &#13;
we &#13;
commit &#13;
ourselves &#13;
to &#13;
full &#13;
implementation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Plan &#13;
ultimately &#13;
supported &#13;
by &#13;
the &#13;
Central Bank. &#13;
Our &#13;
aim &#13;
is &#13;
to &#13;
convert &#13;
BPC &#13;
into &#13;
a corporate &#13;
entity &#13;
(Sociedad &#13;
Anonima) &#13;
within &#13;
the &#13;
public &#13;
sector &#13;
and &#13;
strengthen &#13;
its &#13;
finances &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
goal &#13;
of &#13;
permitting &#13;
its &#13;
sale &#13;
when &#13;
market &#13;
conditions &#13;
permit. &#13;
Our &#13;
legislature &#13;
has &#13;
approved &#13;
new &#13;
legislation &#13;
strengthening &#13;
the &#13;
governance, &#13;
accountability, &#13;
and &#13;
performance &#13;
orientation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
EPEC &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
goal &#13;
of &#13;
improving &#13;
both &#13;
services &#13;
to &#13;
customers and &#13;
return &#13;
on public &#13;
assets. &#13;
My &#13;
administration &#13;
will &#13;
sign &#13;
an &#13;
explicit &#13;
performance &#13;
contract &#13;
with &#13;
EPEC to &#13;
help &#13;
increase &#13;
the &#13;
focus &#13;
on &#13;
performance and &#13;
public &#13;
accountability. &#13;
It &#13;
is &#13;
also &#13;
our &#13;
hope &#13;
that &#13;
when &#13;
market &#13;
conditions &#13;
improve &#13;
the &#13;
incorporation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
private &#13;
capital &#13;
so &#13;
desperately needed &#13;
to &#13;
expand &#13;
power &#13;
capacity &#13;
will &#13;
be &#13;
forthcoming. &#13;
19. &#13;
Public &#13;
Administration. &#13;
Here too &#13;
major &#13;
progress &#13;
is &#13;
being &#13;
made. &#13;
In &#13;
the &#13;
area &#13;
of &#13;
budget administration, &#13;
along &#13;
with &#13;
new &#13;
financial &#13;
management &#13;
information &#13;
system, &#13;
a &#13;
law &#13;
was &#13;
submitted and approved that &#13;
is &#13;
compatible &#13;
with &#13;
the federal &#13;
government&#146;s &#13;
system. &#13;
This &#13;
supersedes &#13;
our &#13;
old &#13;
accounting &#13;
law. &#13;
Changes &#13;
have already &#13;
been &#13;
made &#13;
with &#13;
respect &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
preparation &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Revenue and &#13;
Expenditure &#13;
Budget &#13;
for &#13;
FY &#13;
2003, &#13;
which &#13;
was &#13;
submitted &#13;
to &#13;
the &#13;
Legislature &#13;
within &#13;
the &#13;
stipulated &#13;
time &#13;
period &#13;
and &#13;
has &#13;
already been &#13;
approved. &#13;
The &#13;
internal &#13;
computer &#13;
network &#13;
system &#13;
was &#13;
replaced &#13;
with &#13;
a new &#13;
and &#13;
more &#13;
modern &#13;
system &#13;
that &#13;
is &#13;
connected &#13;
to &#13;
all &#13;
the &#13;
government &#13;
departments, &#13;
thereby &#13;
optimizing &#13;
the &#13;
administrative &#13;
functioning &#13;
of &#13;
this &#13;
system. &#13;
Accounting &#13;
records were established &#13;
as &#13;
well &#13;
as &#13;
mechanisms &#13;
to &#13;
oversee &#13;
the &#13;
economic, &#13;
financial, &#13;
and &#13;
property-related &#13;
management &#13;
of &#13;
state &#13;
authorities &#13;
and &#13;
officials &#13;
with &#13;
accounting &#13;
responsibility &#13;
for &#13;
state-owned &#13;
funds, &#13;
assets, &#13;
and &#13;
property. &#13;
We &#13;
have reduced the &#13;
number &#13;
of &#13;
ministries &#13;
and &#13;
secretariats &#13;
and, &#13;
following &#13;
a &#13;
public &#13;
referendum &#13;
reduced the &#13;
number &#13;
of &#13;
legislators &#13;
and &#13;
eliminated &#13;
one &#13;
house &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Provincial &#13;
legislature. &#13;
We &#13;
have &#13;
introduced &#13;
a &#13;
civil &#13;
service &#13;
management &#13;
information &#13;
system that &#13;
providing &#13;
more &#13;
comprehensive, &#13;
reliable &#13;
and &#13;
updated &#13;
information &#13;
of &#13;
all &#13;
public &#13;
sector employees, &#13;
as &#13;
well &#13;
as &#13;
oversight over &#13;
the &#13;
selection, &#13;
hiring, &#13;
training &#13;
and &#13;
firing &#13;
processes. &#13;
We &#13;
have &#13;
drafted &#13;
and &#13;
will &#13;
submit &#13;
shortly draft &#13;
legislation &#13;
to &#13;
modernize &#13;
public &#13;
procurement. &#13;
My &#13;
administration &#13;
is &#13;
also &#13;
announcing  and &#13;
implementing &#13;
a &#13;
22 &#13;
Page  26&#13;
complementary  program &#13;
to &#13;
increase transparency &#13;
and attack &#13;
corruption &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
public &#13;
sector. &#13;
20. &#13;
Social &#13;
Sector. &#13;
We &#13;
have &#13;
made, &#13;
and &#13;
will &#13;
continue &#13;
to &#13;
make, &#13;
serious &#13;
efforts &#13;
to &#13;
maximize &#13;
the efficiency &#13;
and &#13;
effectiveness &#13;
in &#13;
human &#13;
capital &#13;
spending &#13;
in &#13;
health, &#13;
education, &#13;
and &#13;
social &#13;
protection &#13;
within &#13;
the &#13;
severe &#13;
constraints we &#13;
face. &#13;
The &#13;
processes &#13;
underway &#13;
involving &#13;
privatizations, &#13;
concessions, &#13;
and &#13;
contracting &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
functions &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Provincial &#13;
Bank, &#13;
the &#13;
provincial &#13;
power &#13;
company, &#13;
and the &#13;
casino and &#13;
lottery &#13;
businesses, &#13;
will &#13;
over &#13;
time &#13;
enable &#13;
us &#13;
to &#13;
reduce &#13;
our &#13;
debt &#13;
and &#13;
to &#13;
begin &#13;
to &#13;
make &#13;
the &#13;
capital &#13;
investments that &#13;
are &#13;
essential &#13;
in &#13;
order &#13;
to &#13;
enhance &#13;
the &#13;
productive &#13;
profile &#13;
of &#13;
our province. &#13;
As &#13;
indicated &#13;
above, &#13;
social &#13;
protection &#13;
remains &#13;
a &#13;
top &#13;
priority &#13;
in &#13;
terms &#13;
of &#13;
funding &#13;
and &#13;
measures &#13;
to &#13;
better target &#13;
and account &#13;
for &#13;
resources. &#13;
In &#13;
the &#13;
health &#13;
sector &#13;
we have taken numerous &#13;
measures &#13;
to &#13;
improve &#13;
the &#13;
efficiency &#13;
and effectiveness &#13;
of &#13;
hospitals and the &#13;
Ministry &#13;
of &#13;
Health &#13;
despite &#13;
severe &#13;
constraints &#13;
on &#13;
resources &#13;
and &#13;
increased &#13;
demand. &#13;
We &#13;
are &#13;
evaluating &#13;
the &#13;
progress &#13;
achieved &#13;
in &#13;
public &#13;
hospitals &#13;
against &#13;
specific performance &#13;
indicators &#13;
as &#13;
a &#13;
means &#13;
to &#13;
further &#13;
adjust the &#13;
reform &#13;
effort. &#13;
Progress &#13;
has &#13;
been achieved &#13;
in &#13;
terms &#13;
of &#13;
quality &#13;
monitoring, &#13;
training, &#13;
and &#13;
procurement, &#13;
and &#13;
we &#13;
will &#13;
continue focusing &#13;
on &#13;
areas &#13;
of &#13;
bill &#13;
collection &#13;
and &#13;
better &#13;
hospital &#13;
budget &#13;
planning. &#13;
I &#13;
regret that &#13;
we &#13;
have &#13;
not &#13;
been &#13;
able &#13;
to &#13;
pilot &#13;
an &#13;
innovative &#13;
scheme &#13;
of &#13;
universal  health &#13;
care &#13;
-a &#13;
goal &#13;
that &#13;
will &#13;
need &#13;
to &#13;
be &#13;
pursued &#13;
in &#13;
the &#13;
future &#13;
following &#13;
economic recovery. &#13;
I &#13;
am &#13;
especially &#13;
proud &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
gains &#13;
registered &#13;
in &#13;
education, &#13;
even &#13;
though &#13;
much &#13;
remains &#13;
to be &#13;
done. &#13;
Despite &#13;
the &#13;
switch &#13;
of &#13;
many &#13;
students &#13;
to &#13;
public &#13;
schools we have &#13;
been &#13;
able &#13;
to &#13;
strengthen &#13;
accreditation &#13;
systems, &#13;
spending &#13;
on &#13;
maintenance &#13;
and &#13;
new &#13;
construction, &#13;
improve &#13;
management &#13;
of &#13;
human &#13;
resources, &#13;
decentralize &#13;
many &#13;
decisions &#13;
to &#13;
schools, &#13;
better track &#13;
student &#13;
performance &#13;
and &#13;
needs, &#13;
and &#13;
increase &#13;
public &#13;
information &#13;
on &#13;
school performance. &#13;
A &#13;
remaining &#13;
challenge &#13;
is &#13;
to &#13;
reduce &#13;
our &#13;
ratio &#13;
of &#13;
teachers &#13;
to &#13;
students. &#13;
Teacher &#13;
absenteeism &#13;
has &#13;
declined (although &#13;
not &#13;
as &#13;
much &#13;
as &#13;
planned &#13;
as &#13;
many &#13;
teachers &#13;
responded &#13;
to &#13;
new &#13;
license  requirements &#13;
by &#13;
increasing their &#13;
training &#13;
efforts) &#13;
because &#13;
we have &#13;
instituted &#13;
a &#13;
successful &#13;
new &#13;
system &#13;
to &#13;
better &#13;
monitor &#13;
and &#13;
verify &#13;
teacher absenteeism due &#13;
to &#13;
medical &#13;
reasons. &#13;
The &#13;
Future &#13;
21. &#13;
The &#13;
continued &#13;
support &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
World &#13;
Bank &#13;
is &#13;
critical &#13;
to &#13;
our &#13;
reform &#13;
process. &#13;
In &#13;
addition &#13;
to &#13;
financing, &#13;
the &#13;
presence &#13;
of &#13;
the &#13;
Bank, &#13;
its &#13;
technical &#13;
assistance &#13;
and &#13;
its &#13;
credibility &#13;
as &#13;
a neutral &#13;
party &#13;
has &#13;
been &#13;
of &#13;
notable &#13;
help &#13;
as &#13;
we &#13;
try &#13;
to &#13;
keep &#13;
the &#13;
momentum &#13;
for &#13;
the &#13;
reform &#13;
so &#13;
necessary &#13;
for &#13;
sustained &#13;
development &#13;
in &#13;
this &#13;
province &#13;
and &#13;
nation &#13;
and &#13;
the &#13;
well &#13;
being &#13;
of &#13;
our &#13;
citizens.  Despite &#13;
the serious &#13;
challenges &#13;
confronting &#13;
Argentina &#13;
we &#13;
are &#13;
confident &#13;
that &#13;
Cordoba &#13;
will &#13;
achieve &#13;
in &#13;
the near &#13;
term &#13;
the &#13;
revised objectives &#13;
supported &#13;
by &#13;
its &#13;
loan &#13;
with &#13;
the &#13;
World &#13;
Bank, and &#13;
we &#13;
are &#13;
committed &#13;
to &#13;
carry out &#13;
the &#13;
Revised &#13;
Program &#13;
in &#13;
accordance &#13;
with &#13;
its &#13;
terms. &#13;
Sincerely, &#13;

            Argentina Proposed Amendments/Waivers of
            the Cordoba Provincial  Reform Loan
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This memorandum seeks the approval of
            the Executive Directors to amend the loan agreement for the
            Cordoba Provincial Reform Loan (4585-AR). Due to the impact
            of the severe macroeconomic developments in Argentina, the
            CPRL is being reformulated in terms of amendments to
            individual conditions and its tranching. The proposed
            amendment would allow the Province of Cordoba to meet the
            overall objectives of its reform program, as previously
            approved by the Board, by taking into account the impact of
            subsequent and fundamental changes in the macroeconomic and
            investment environment and social conditions in Argentina.
            The proposed amendment remains firmly grounded in the
            overall objectives of the loan to promote fiscal stability
            at the provincial level, strengthen the role of private
            capital and the business climate, and promote structural
            reforms to improve the efficiency, quality and equity of
            public spending, particularly in the social sectors, in
            Cordoba.The proposed reformulation would amend the original
            second and third tranches of $100 million each, while
            splitting the original third tranche into a revised third
            tranche of $25 million and a new fourth tranche of $75
            million. This approach reflects the substantial progress
            made so far in the implementation of the reform program, and
            it provides for the reframing of a consistent program in
            response to the changes in the country environment through
            an upfront agreement on revised targets to achieve the
            agreed development goals. Upon the Board's approval of
            the proposed reformulation, and the declaration of
            effectiveness of the legal amendment, the Bank would advise
            the authorities that the revised second and third tranches
            for a total amount of $125 million would be available for withdrawal.
